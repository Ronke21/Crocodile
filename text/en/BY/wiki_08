<text>The Kingdom of Navarre ( ), originally the Kingdom of Pamplona occupied lands on both sides of the western Pyrenees, with its northernmost areas originally reaching the Atlantic Ocean (Bay of Biscay), between present-day Spain and France.

The medieval state took form around the city of Pamplona during the first centuries of the Iberian Reconquista. The kingdom had its origins in the conflict in the buffer region between the Carolingian Empire and the Ummayad Emirate of Córdoba that controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula. The city of Pamplona (; ), had been the main city of the indigenous Vasconic population and was located in a predominantly Basque-speaking area.

In an event traditionally dated to 824, Íñigo Arista was elected or declared ruler of the area around Pamplona in opposition to Frankish expansion into the region, originally as vassal to the Córdoba emirate. This polity evolved into the Kingdom of Pamplona. A series of partitions and dynastic changes led to a diminution of its territory and to periods of rule by the kings of Aragon (1054–1134) and France (1285–1328).

In the 15th century, another dynastic dispute over control by the king of Aragon led to internal divisions and the eventual conquest of the southern part of the kingdom by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1512 (permanently annexed in 1524). It was annexed by the Courts of Castile to the Crown of Castile in 1515 as a separate kingdom with its own Courts and judiciary until 1841.

The remaining northern part of the kingdom was once again joined with France by personal union in 1589 when King Henry III of Navarre inherited the French throne as Henry IV of France, and in 1620 it was merged into the Kingdom of France. The monarchs of this unified state took the title &quot;King of France and Navarre&quot; until its fall in the French Revolution, and again during the Bourbon Restoration from 1814 until 1830 (with a brief interregnum in 1815).

The ancient Kingdom of Navarre covered, at its greatest extent, approximately the modern-day Spanish autonomous communities of Navarre, Basque Country and La Rioja and the French territory of Lower Navarre in Pyrénées-Atlantiques.

==Etymology==
There are similar earlier toponyms but the first documentation of Latin appears in Eginhard&#x27;s chronicle of the feats of Charles the Great. Other Royal Frankish Annals give &quot;nabarros&quot;. Several Frankish sources mention the &quot;nabarri/navarri&quot; and the &quot;Hispani wascones&quot;, and also &quot;pampilonensi&quot;.

There are two proposed etymologies for the name of //:

* Basque (declined absolutive singular ): &quot;brownish&quot;, &quot;multicolor&quot;, which would be a contrast with the green mountain lands north of the original County of Navarre.
* Basque , Castilian (&quot;valley&quot;, &quot;plain&quot;, present across Spain) + Basque (&quot;people&quot;, &quot;land&quot;).

The linguist Joan Coromines considers &quot;naba&quot; as not clearly Basque in origin but as part of a wider pre-Roman substrate.

==Early historic background==

The kingdom originated in the southern side of the western Pyrenees, in the flatlands around the city of Pamplona. According to Roman geographers such as Pliny the Elder and Livy, these regions were inhabited by the Vascones and other related Vasconic-Aquitanian tribes, a pre-Indo-European group of peoples who inhabited the southern slopes of the western Pyrenees and part of the shore of the Bay of Biscay. These tribes spoke an archaic version of the Basque language, usually known by linguistics as Proto-Basque, as well as some other related languages, such as the Aquitanian language. The Romans took full control of the area by 74 BC, but unlike their northern neighbors, the Aquitanians, and other tribes from the Iberian Peninsula, the Vascones negotiated their status within the Roman Empire. The region first was part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior, then of the Hispania Tarraconensis. It would be under the jurisdiction of the of Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza).

The Roman Empire influenced the area in urbanization, language, infrastructure, commerce, and industry. During the Sertorian War, Pompey would command the foundation of a city in Vasconic territory, giving origin to &quot;Pompaelo&quot;, modern-day Pamplona, founded on a previously existent Vasconic town. Romanization of the Vascones led to their eventual adoption of forms of Latin that would evolve into the Navarro-Aragonese language, though the Basque language would remain widely spoken, especially in rural and mountainous areas.

After the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Vascones were slow to be incorporated into the Visigothic Kingdom, which was in a civil war that provided the opportunity for the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The Basque leadership most likely joined the Umayyad caliphate in the hope of stability brought by the Muslim conquerors. By 718, Pamplona had formed a pact that allowed a wide degree of autonomy in exchange for military and political subjugation, along with the payment of tribute to Córdoba. Burial ornamentation shows strong contacts with the Merovingian France and the Gascons of Aquitaine, but also items with Islamic inscriptions, while a Muslim cemetery in Pamplona, the use of which spanned several generations, suggests the presence of a Muslim garrison in the decades following the Arab invasion.

The origin and foundation of the Kingdom of Pamplona is intrinsically related to the southern expansion of the Frankish kingdom under the Merovingians and their successors, the Carolingians. About 601, the Duchy of Vasconia () was established by the Merovingians, based around Roman Novempopulania and extending from the southern branch of the River Garonne to the northern side of the Pyrenees. The first documented Duke of Vasconia was Genial, who would hold that position until 627.

The Duchy of Vasconia then became a frontier territory with varying levels of autonomy granted by the Merovingian monarchs. The suppression of the Duchy of Vasconia as well as the Duchy of Aquitaine by the Carolingians would lead to a rebellion, led by Lupo II of Gascony. Pepin the Short launched a punitive War in Aquitaine (760–768) that put down the uprising and resulted in the division of the duchy into several counties, ruled from Toulouse. Similarly, across the eastern Pyrenees the Marca Hispánica was established next to the Marca Gothica, a Frankish attempt at creating buffer states between the Carolingian empire and the Emirate of Córdoba.

The Franks under Charlemagne extended their influence and control southward, occupying several regions of the north and east of the Iberian Peninsula. It is unclear how solidly the Franks exercised control over Pamplona. In 778, Charlemagne was invited by rebellious Muslim lords on the Upper March of Al-Andalus to lead an expedition south with the intention of taking the city of Zaragoza from the Emirate of Córdoba. However, the expedition was a failure, and the Frankish army was forced to withdraw. During their retreat, they destroyed the city walls of Pamplona to weaken the city and avoid a possible rebellion, reminiscent of the approach the Carolingians had used elsewhere against Christian cities that seemed content to live under Córdoban control.

However, while moving through the Pyrenees on 15 August 778, the rearguard of the Frankish army, led by Roland was attacked by the Basque tribes in a confrontation that came to be known as the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. Roland was killed and the rearguard scattered. As a response to the attempted Frankish seizure of Zaragoza, the Córdoban emir retook the city of Pamplona and its surrounding lands. In 781 two local Basque lords, Ibn Balask (&quot;son of Velasco&quot;), and Mothmin al-Akra (&quot;Jimeno &quot;the Strong&quot;&quot;) were defeated and forced to submit. The next mention of Pamplona is in 799, when Mutarrif ibn Musa, thought to have been a governor of the city and a member of the muwallad Banu Qasi family, was killed there by a pro-Frankish faction.

During this period, Basque territory extended on the west to somewhere around the headwaters of the Ebro river. Equally Einhart&#x27;s &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; pinpoints the source of the Ebro in the land of the Navarrese. However, this western region fell under the influence of the Kingdom of Asturias.

The Franks renewed their attempts to control the region and in 806 took Navarre under their protection. Following a truce between the Frankish kingdom and Córdoba, in 812 Louis the Pious went to Pamplona, likely to establish there a county that would prove short-lived. However, continued rebellion in Gascony rendered Frankish control south of the Pyrenees tenuous, and the Emirate was able to reclaim the region following victory in the 816 Battle of Pancorbo, in which they defeated and killed the &quot;enemy of Allah&quot;, Balask al-Yalaski (Velasco the Gascon), along with the uncle of Alfonso II of Asturias, Garcia ibn Lubb (&#x27;son of Lupus&#x27;), Sancho, the &#x27;premier knight of Pamplona&#x27;, and the pagan warrior Ṣaltān. North of the Pyrenees in the same year, Louis the Pious removed Seguin as Duke of Vasconia, which initiated a rebellion, led by Garcia Jiménez, who was killed in 818. Louis&#x27;s son Pepin, then King of Aquitaine, stamped out the Vasconic revolt in Gascony then hunted the chieftains who had taken refuge in southern Vasconia, i.e., Pamplona and Navarre, no longer controlled by the Franks. He sent an army led by the counts Aeblus and Aznar Sanchez (the latter being appointed lord, but not duke, of Vasconia by Pepin after suppressing the uprising in the duchy), accomplishing their goals with no resistance in Pamplona (which still lacked walls after the 778 destruction). On the way back, however, they were ambushed and defeated in Roncevaux by a force probably composed both of Basques and the Córdoba-allied muwallad Banu Qasi.

==Nascent state and kingdom==

===Establishment by Iñigo Arista===

Out of the pattern of competing Frankish and Córdoban interests, the Basque chieftain Íñigo Arista took power. Tradition tells he was elected as king of Pamplona in 824, giving rise to a dynasty of kings in Pamplona that would last for eighty years. However, the region around Pamplona continued to fall within the sphere of influence of Córdoba, presumably as part of its broader frontier region, the Upper March, ruled by Íñigo&#x27;s half-brother, Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi. The city was allowed to remain Christian and have its own administration but had to pay the traditional taxes to the emirate, including the &quot;jizya&quot; assessed on non-Muslims living under their control. Íñigo Arista is mentioned in Arab records as &quot;sâhib&quot; (lord) or &quot;amîr&quot; of the Vascones (&quot;bashkunish&quot;) and not as &quot;malik&quot; (king) or &quot;tâgiya&quot; (tyrant) used for the kings of Asturias and France, indicating the lower status of these &quot;ulûj&quot; (barbarians, not accepting Islam) within the Córdoba sphere. In 841, in concert with Musa ibn Musa, Íñigo rebelled. Although Musa was eventually forced to submit, Íñigo was still in rebellion at the time of his death in 851/2.

Pamplona and Navarre are distinguished in Carolingian chronicles. Pamplona is cited in 778 as a Navarrese stronghold, which may be due to their lack of information about the Basque territory. The chronicles did distinguish between Navarre and its main town in 806 (&quot;In Hispania, vero Navarrensis et Pampelonensis&quot;), while the &quot;Annals of Fontenelle&quot; refers to &quot;Induonis et Mitionis, ducum Navarrorum&quot; (Induo [Íñigo Arista] and Mitio [perhaps Jimeno], dukes of the Navarrese). However, Arab chroniclers make no such distinctions, and just refer to the &quot;Baskunisi&quot;, a transliteration of &quot;Vascones&quot;, since a big majority of the population was Basque. The primitive Navarre may have comprised the valleys of Goñi, Gesalaz, Lana, Allin, Deierri, Berrueza and Mañeru, which later formed the &quot;merindad&quot; of Estella.

The role of Pamplona as a focus coordinating both rebellion against and accommodation with Córdoba seen under Íñigo would continue under his son, García Íñiguez (851/2–882), who formed alliances with Asturias, Gascons, Aragonese and with families in Zaragoza opposed to Musa ibn Musa. This established a pattern of raids and counter-raids, capturing slaves and treasure, as well as full military campaigns that would restore full Córdoban control with renewed oaths of fidelity. His son Fortún Garcés (882-905) spent two decades in Córdoban captivity before succeeding in Pamplona as vassal of the emirate. Neither of these kings would make significant territorial expansion. This period of a fractious, but in the end subservient, Navarre came to an end amidst a period when generalized rebellion within the emirate prevented them from being able to suppress the inertial forces in the western Pyrenees. The ineffectual Fortún was forced to abdicate in favor of a new dynasty from the vehemently anti-Muslim east of Navarre, the founders of which took a less accommodationist view. With this change, al-Andalus sources shift to calling the Pamplona rulers &#x27;tyrants&#x27;, as with the independent kings of Asturias: Pamplona had passed out of the Córdoban sphere.

===Jiménez rule===

After taking the political power from Fortún Garcés, Sancho Garcés (905–925), son of Dadilde, sister of Raymond I, Count of Pallars and Ribagorza, proclaimed himself king, terminating the alliance with the Emirate of Córdoba and expanding its domains through the course of the River Ega all the way south to the Ebro and taking the regions of Nájera and Calahorra, which caused the decline of the Banu Qasi family, who ruled these lands. As a response, Abd-ar-Rahman III undertook two expeditions to these lands, earning a victory at the Battle of Valdejunquera, after which the emirate retook the lands south of the River Ebro, and by 924 attacked Pamplona. The daughter of Sancho Garcés, Sancha, was married to the King of León Ordoño II, establishing an alliance with the Leónese kingdom and ensuring the Calahorra region. The valleys of the River Aragón and River Gállego all the way down to Sobrarbe also ended up under control of Pamplona, and to the west the lands of the kingdom reached the counties of Álava and Castile, which were under control of the Kingdom of Asturias. The kingdom had at this time an extent of about 15,000 km. The &quot;Chronicle of Albelda&quot; (last updated in 976) outlines the extent in 905 of the Kingdom of Pamplona for the first time. It extended to Nájera and Arba (arguably Araba). Some historians believe that this suggests that it included the Western Basque Country as well:

After the death of Sancho Garcés, the crown passed to his brother, Jimeno Garcés (925–931), joined by Sancho&#x27;s underage son, García Sánchez (931–970), in his last year. García continued to rule under the tutelage of his mother, Sancho&#x27;s widow Toda Aznarez, who also engineered several political marriages with the other Christian kingdoms and counties of northern Iberia. Oneca was married to Alfonso IV of León and her sister Urraca to Ramiro II of León, while other daughters of Sancho were married to counts of Castile, Álava and Bigorre. The marriage of the Pamplonese King García Sánchez with Andregoto Galíndez, daughter of Galindo Aznárez II, Count of Aragon linked the eastern county to the kingdom. In 934, he invited Abd-ar-Rahman III to intervene in the kingdom in order to emancipate himself from his mother, and this began a period of tributary status by Pamplona and frequent punitive campaigns from Córdoba.

García Sánchez&#x27;s heir, Sancho II (970–994), set up his half brother, Ramiro Garcés of Viguera, to rule in the short-lived Kingdom of Viguera. The &quot;Historia General de Navarra&quot;, by Jaime del Burgo, says that on the occasion of the donation of the villa of Alastue by the king of Pamplona to the monastery of San Juan de la Peña in 987, he styled himself &quot;King of Navarre&quot;, the first time that title had been used. In many places he appears as the first King of Navarre and in others the third; however, he was at least the seventh king of Pamplona.

During the late 10th century, Almanzor, the ruler of Al Andalus, frequently led raids against the Christian kingdoms, and attacked the Pamplonese lands on at least nine occasions. In 966, clashes between the Caliphate of Córdoba and the kingdom resulted in the loss of Calahorra and the valley of the River Cidacos. Sancho II, while allied with Castilian militias, suffered a grave defeat in the Battle of Torrevicente. Sancho II was forced to hand over one of his daughters and one of his sons as tokens of peace. After the death of Sancho II and during the reign of García Sánchez II, Pamplona was attacked by the caliphate on several occasions, being completely destroyed in 999, the King himself killed during a raid in the year 1000.

After the death of García Sánchez II, the crown passed to Sancho III, just eight years old at the time, and probably completely controlled by the caliphate. During the first years of his reign the kingdom was ruled by his cousins Sancho and García of Viguera until the year 1004, when Sancho III would become ruling king, mentored by his mother Jimena Fernández. The links with Castile became stronger through marriages. The death of Almanzor in 1002 and his successor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 1008 caused the decline of the Caliphate of Córdoba and the progress of the County of Castile south, while Pamplona, led by Sancho Garcés III, strengthen the position of his kingdom on the borderlands of the Taifa of Zaragoza, controlling the territories of Loarre, Funes, Sos, Uncastillo, Arlas, Caparroso and Boltaña.

In the year 1011 Sancho III married Muniadona of Castile, daughter of the Count of Castile, Sancho García. In 1016 the County of Castile and the Kingdom of Navarre made a pact on their future expansion: Pamplona would expand towards the south and east, the eastern region of Soria and the Ebro valley, including territories that were at the time part of Zaragoza. Thus, the Kingdom of Pamplona comprised a territory of 15,000 km2 between Pamplona, Nájera and Aragón with vassals of Pamplonese and Aragonese origin.

The assassination of Count García Sánchez of Castile in 1028 allowed Sancho to appoint his younger son Ferdinand as count. He also exerted a protectorate over the Duchy of Gascony. He seized the country of the Pisuerga and the Cea, which belonged to the Kingdom of León, and marched armies to the heart of that kingdom, forcing king Bermudo III of León to flee to a Galician refuge. Sancho thereby effectively ruled the north of Iberia from the boundaries of Galicia to those of the County of Barcelona.

By the time of the death of Sancho III in 1035, the kingdom had reached its greatest historical extent. Sancho III wrote a problematic will, in which he divided his territory into three kingdoms.

===Ecclesiastical affairs===
In this period of independence, the ecclesiastical affairs of the country reached a high state of development. Sancho the Great was brought up at Leyre, which was also for a short time the capital of the Diocese of Pamplona. Beside this see, there existed the Bishopric of Oca, which was united in 1079 to the Diocese of Burgos. In 1035 Sancho III re-established the See of Palencia, which had been laid waste at the time of the Moorish invasion. When, in 1045, the city of Calahorra was wrested from the Moors, under whose dominion it had been for more than three hundred years, a see was also founded there, which in the same year absorbed the Diocese of Najera and, in 1088, the Diocese of Alava, the jurisdiction of which covered about the same ground as that of the present Diocese of Vitoria. The See of Pamplona owed its re-establishment to Sancho III, who for this purpose convened a synod at Leyre in 1022 and one at Pamplona in 1023. These synods likewise instituted a reform of ecclesiastical life, with the above-named convent as a centre.

==Dismemberment==

===Division of Sancho&#x27;s domains===
At its greatest extent the Kingdom of Navarre included all the modern Spanish province; the northern slope of the western Pyrenees the Spaniards called the &quot;ultra puertos&quot; (&quot;country beyond the mountain passes&quot;) or French Navarre; the Basque provinces of Spain and France; the Bureba, the valley between the Basque mountains and the Montes de Oca to the north of Burgos; and the Rioja and Tarazona in the upper valley of the Ebro. On his death, Sancho divided his possessions among his four sons. Sancho the Great&#x27;s realm was never again united (until Ferdinand the Catholic): Castile was permanently joined to León, whereas Aragon enlarged its territory, joining Catalonia through a marriage.

Following the traditional succession customs, the first-born son of Sancho III, García Sánchez III, received the title and lands of the Kingdom of Pamplona, which included the territory of Pamplona, Nájera and parts of Aragon. The rest of the territory was given to his widow Muniadona of Castile to split among all the legitimate sons: thus García Sánchez III also received the territory to the northeast from the County of Castile (La Bureba, Montes de Oca) and the County of Álava. Ferdinand received the rest of the County of Castile and the lands between the Pisuerga and the Cea. Another son of Sancho, Gonzalo, received the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribargoza as vassal of his eldest brother, García. Lands in Aragon were allotted to Sancho&#x27;s bastard son Ramiro.

===Partition and union with Aragon===
García Sánchez III (1035–1054) soon found himself struggling for supremacy against his ambitious brothers, especially Ferdinand. García had supported the armed conflict between Ferdinand and his brother-in-law Bermudo III of León, who was ultimately killed in the Battle of Tamarón (1037). This allowed Ferdinand to unite his Castilian county with the new-won crown of León as king Ferdinand I. For several years a mutual collaboration between the two kingdoms took place. The relationship between García and his step-brother Ramiro was better. The latter had acquired all of Aragon, Ribagorza and Sobrarbe on the sudden death of his brother Gonzalo, forming what would become the Kingdom of Aragon. García and Ramiro&#x27;s alliance with Ramon Berenguer, the Count of Barcelona, was effective to keep the Muslim Taifa of Zaragoza at bay. After the capture of Calahorra in 1044, a period peace followed on the southern border and trade was established with Zaragoza.

The relationship between García and Ferdinand deteriorated with time, the two disputing the lands on the Pamplonese-Castilian border, and ended violently in September 1054 at the Battle of Atapuerca, in which García was killed, and Ferdinand took from Pamplona the lands in La Bureba and the Tirón River.

García was succeeded by Sancho IV (1054–1076) &quot;of Peñalén&quot;, whom Ferdinand had recognised as king of Pamplona immediately after the death of his father. He was fourteen years old at the time, and under the regency of his mother Stephanie and his uncles Ferdinand and Ramiro. After the death of his mother in 1058, Sancho IV lost the support of the local nobility, and the relations between them worsened after he became allied with Ahmad al-Muqtadir, ruler of Zaragoza. On 4 June 1076, a conspiracy involving Sancho IV&#x27;s brother Ramón and sister Ermesinda ended with the murder of the king. The neighboring kingdoms and the nobility probably had a part in the plot.

The dynastic crisis resulting from Sancho&#x27;s assassination worked to the benefit of the Castilian and Aragonese monarchs. Alfonso VI of León and Castile took control of La Rioja, the Lordship of Biscay, the County of Álava, the County of Durango and part of Gipuzkoa. Sancho Ramírez, successor to his father, Ramiro of Aragon, took control of the rest of the territory and was recognised as king by the Pamplonese nobility. The land around the city of Pamplona, the core of the original kingdom, became known as the County of Navarre, and was recognised by Alfonso VI as a vassal state of the kingdom of León and Castile. Sancho Ramírez began in 1084 a renewed military expansion of the southern lands controlled by Muslim forces. That year, the city of Arguedas, from which the Bardenas region could be controlled, was taken. After the death of Sancho Ramírez in 1094, he was succeeded by Peter I, who resumed the expansion of the territory, taking the cities of Sádaba in 1096 and Milagro in 1098, while threatening Tudela.

Alfonso the Battler (1104–1134), brother of Peter I, secured for the country its greatest territorial expansion. He wrested Tudela from the Moors (1114), re-conquered the entire country of Bureba, which Navarre had lost in 1042, and advanced into the current Province of Burgos. He also annexed Labourd, with its strategic port of Bayonne, but lost its coastal half to the Duchy of Aquitaine soon after. The remainder has been part of Navarre since then and eventually came to be known as Lower Navarre. Toward the south, he moved the Islamic border to the Ebro river, with Rioja, Nájera, Logroño, Calahorra, and Alfaro added to his domain.
In 1118, the city of Zaragoza was taken by the Aragonese forces, and on 25 February 1119 the city of Tudela was taken and incorporated into Pamplona.

The 1127 Peace of Támara delimited the territorial domains of the Castilian and Aragonese realms, the latter including Pamplona. The lands of Biscay, Álava, Gipuzkoa, Belorado, Soria and San Esteban de Gormaz went back to the Pamplonese kingdom.

===Restoration and the loss of western Navarre===

The status quo between Aragon and Castile stood until the 1134 death of Alfonso. Being childless, he willed his realm to the military orders, particularly the Templars. This decision was rejected by the cortes (parliaments) of both Aragon and Navarre, which then chose separate kings.

García Ramírez, known as &quot;the Restorer&quot;, was the first King of Navarre to use such a title. He was Lord of Monzón, a grandson of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid, and a descendant by illegitimate line of King García Sánchez III. Sancho Garcia, known as Sancho VI &quot;the Wise&quot; (1150–1194), a patron of learning, as well as an accomplished statesman, fortified Navarre within and without, granted charters (fueros) to a number of towns, and was never defeated in battle. He was the first king to issue royal documents entitling him &quot;rex Navarrae&quot; or &quot;rex Navarrorum&quot;, appealing to a wider power base, defined as politico-juridical by Urzainqui (a &quot;populus&quot;), beyond Pamplona and the customary &quot;rex Pampilonensium&quot;. As attested in the charters of San Sebastián and Vitoria-Gasteiz (1181), the natives are called &quot;Navarri&quot;, as well as in another contemporary document at least, where those living to the north of Peralta are defined as Navarrese.
&quot;The Restorer&quot; and Sancho the Wise were faced with an ever-increasing intervention of Castile in Navarre. In 1170, Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor, daughter of Henry II of England, married, with the Castilian king claiming Gascony as part of the dowry. It turned out a much needed pretext for the invasion of Navarre during the following years (1173–1176), with a special focus on Navarre&#x27;s coastal districts, coveted by Castile in order to become a maritime power. In 1177, the dispute was submitted to arbitration by Henry II of England. The Navarrese made their point on a number of claims, namely &quot;the proven will of the locals&quot; (&quot;fide naturalium hominum suorum exhibita&quot;), the assassination of the King Sancho Garces IV of Navarre by the Castilians (&quot;per violentiam fuit expulsus&quot;, 1076), as well as law and custom, while the Castilians made their case by citing the Castilian takeover following the death of Sancho Garces IV, the dynastic links of Alfonso with Navarre, and the conquest of Toledo. Henry did not dare issue a verdict based entirely on the legal grounds as presented by both sides, instead deciding to refer them back to the boundaries held by both kingdoms at the start of their reigns in 1158, besides agreeing to a truce of seven years. It thus confirmed the permanent loss of the Bureba and Rioja areas for the Navarrese. However, soon, Castile breached the compromise, starting a renewed effort to harass Navarre both in the diplomatic and military arenas.

The rich dowry of Berengaria, daughter of Sancho VI the Wise and Blanche of Castile, made her a desirable catch for Richard I of England. His mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, crossed the Pyrenean passes to escort Berengaria to Sicily, eventually to wed Richard in Cyprus, on 12 May 1191. She remains the only Queen of England who never set foot in England during her reign. The reign of Sancho the Wise&#x27;s successor, the last king of the male line of Sancho the Great and the kings of Pamplona, Sancho VII the Strong (&quot;Sancho el Fuerte&quot;) (1194–1234), was more troubled. He appropriated the revenues of churches and convents, granting them instead important privileges; in 1198 he presented to the See of Pamplona his palaces and possessions there; this gift was confirmed by Pope Innocent III on 29 January 1199.

In 1199 Alfonso VIII of Castile, son of Sancho III of Castile and Blanche of Navarre, was determined to take over coastal Navarre, a strategic region that would allow Castile much easier access to European wool markets and would isolate Navarre as well. He launched a massive expedition against Navarre.Sancho the Strong was abroad in Tlemcen (modern Algeria) seeking support to counter the Castilian push, by opening a second front. Pope Celestine III intervened to frustrate the alliance.

The towns of Vitoria and Treviño resisted the Castilian assault but the Bishop of Pamplona was sent to inform them that no reinforcements would arrive. After nine months of siege, Vitoria surrendered, but Treviño did not, having to be conquered by force of arms. By 1200 the conquest of western Navarre was complete. Castile allowed these territories (with the exceptions of Treviño and Oñati, which were directly ruled from Castile) the right to keep their traditional customs and laws (&quot;viz.&quot;, Navarrese law), which came to be known as fueros. Alava was made a county, Biscay a lordship and Gipuzkoa just a province. In 1207, an arrangement in Guadalajara between both kings sealed a 5-year truce over the occupied territories; still Castile kept a &quot;fait accompli&quot; policy.

Sancho the Strong would join in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), where he added his small force to the Christian alliance that was victorious over the Caliph Muhammand An-Nasir. He suffered from a varicose ulcer in his leg that led him to retire to Tudela, where he died in 1234. His elder sister Berengaria, Queen of England, had died childless some years earlier. His deceased younger sister Blanca, countess of Champagne, had left a son, Theobald IV of Champagne. Thus the Kingdom of Navarre, though the crown was still claimed by the kings of Aragon, passed by marriage to the House of Champagne, firstly to the heirs of Blanca, who were simultaneously counts of Champagne and Brie, with the support of the Navarrese Parliament (&quot;Cortes&quot;).

==Navarre in the Late Middle Ages==
===Rule by Champagne and France===

Theobald I made of his court a centre where the poetry of the troubadours that had developed at the court of the counts of Champagne was welcomed and fostered; his reign was peaceful. His son, King Theobald II (1253–70), married Isabella, daughter of King Louis IX of France, and accompanied his saintly father-in-law upon his crusade to Tunis. On the homeward journey, he died at Trapani in Sicily, and was succeeded by his brother, King Henry I, who had already assumed the reins of government during his absence, but ruled for only three years (1271–74). His daughter, Queen Joan I, ascended as a minor and the country was once again invaded from all sides. The queen and her mother, Blanche of Artois, sought refuge at the court of King Philip III of France. His son, the future King Philip IV of France, had become engaged to the young sovereign and married her in 1284. From 1276, the time of the negotiations for this marriage, Navarre effectively passed into French control, though not without the French suppression of native resistance in the 1276-1277 War of the Navarreria.

The Kingdom of Navarre remained in personal union with the Kingdom of France until the death of King Charles I (Charles IV of France) in 1328, and on March 13 of the same year, Don Juan Martínez de Medrano and Don Juan Corbaran de Lehet were appointed regents of the Kingdom of Navarre for 11 months (February 27, 1329) until the succession in Navarre was resolved. King Charles was succeeded by his niece, Queen Joanna II, daughter of King Louis I (Louis X of France), and nephew-in-law, King Philip III. Joanna waived all claim to the throne of France and accepted as compensation for the counties of Champagne and Brie those of Angoulême, Longueville, and Mortain.

King Philip III devoted himself to the improvement of the laws of the country, and joined King Alfonso XI of Castile in battle against the Moors of 1343. After the death of his mother (1349), King Charles II assumed the reins of government (1349–87). He played an important part in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and in the French civil unrest of the time, and on account of his deceit and cruelty he received the epithet of &#x27;the Bad&#x27;. He gained and lost possessions in Normandy and, later in his reign, the Navarrese Company acquired island possessions in the Byzantine Empire.

His eldest son, on the other hand, King Charles III the Noble, once more returned the land to peaceful and happy government (1387–1425). He reformed the government, built canals, and made the tributaries of the Ebro flowing through Navarre navigable. As he outlived his legitimate sons, he was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Blanche I (1425–1441), and son-in-law, King John II (1398–1479).

===Navarre under the Foix and Albret dynasties===
After Queen Blanche I of Navarre&#x27;s death in 1441, Navarre was mired in continued disputes over royal succession. King John II was ruling in Aragon in the name of his brother, Alfonso V of Aragon. He left his son, Charles, Prince of Viana, with merely the rank of governor, whereas Queen Blanche I had intended him to succeed her, as was the custom. In 1450, John II himself came back to Navarre, and, urged on by his ambitious second wife Juana Enriquez, endeavoured to obtain the succession for their son Ferdinand.

Mirroring inter-clan disputes during the bloody War of the Bands in the rest of the Basque territories, in 1451 Navarre split in two confederacies, the Agramonts and the Beaumonts, over royal succession, with ramifications both within and outside Navarre. In the violent civil war that broke out, the Agramonts sided with John II, and the Beaumonts — named after their leader, the chancellor, John of Beaumont — espoused the cause of Charles, Prince of Viana. The fights involved the high aristocracy and their junior branches, who carried on the feuds of their senior lines and thrived on weak, often absent, royal authority.

The unhappy Prince Charles was defeated by his father at Aibar in 1451, and held prisoner for two years, during which he wrote his famous &quot;Chronicle of Navarre&quot;, a major source for the period. After his release, Charles sought the assistance of King Charles VII of France and his uncle Alfonso V (who resided in Naples), but in vain. In 1460 he was again imprisoned at the instigation of his stepmother, but the Catalans rose in revolt at this injustice, and he was again liberated and named governor of Catalonia. He died in 1461, poisoned by his stepmother Juana Enríquez without being able to retake the reins of Navarre. He had named as heir his next sister, Queen Blanche II, but she was immediately imprisoned by John II and died in 1464. While this episode of the civil war came to an end, it inaugurated a period of instability including on-off periods of struggle and uprisings all the way to the Spanish conquest (1512).

On Charles&#x27; demise in 1461, Eleanor of Navarre, Countess of Foix and Béarn, was proclaimed Princess of Viana, but the instability took a toll. The south-western tip of Navarre—the Sonsierra (Oyon, Laguardia, in present-day Álava), and Los Arcos—was occupied by Henry IV of Castile. Castile&#x27;s eventual annexation of this territory in 1463 was upheld by the French King Louis XI in Bayonne on 23 April 1463. John II continued to rule as king up to 1479, when Queen Eleanor succeeded him for only 15 days and then died; she left the crown to her grandson, Francis Phoebus, but this inaugurated another period of instability. Eleanor&#x27;s 13-year-old granddaughter Catherine I of Navarre succeeded her brother Francis Phoebus in accordance with his will (1483). As a minor she remained under the guardianship of her mother, Magdalena of Valois, and was sought by Ferdinand the Catholic as a bride. However, another claimant to the throne was stubbornly trying to stop her, John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne, brother-in-law of the future King Louis XII of France. Invoking the French Salic Law, he called himself King of Navarre and sent diplomats to Ferdinand II.

Pressure built on Catherine&#x27;s regent Magdalena of Valois who, intent on saving their French possessions, eventually decided to marry the young Queen to the 7-year-old John of Albret, despite the Parliament of Navarre&#x27;s preference for John, Prince of Asturias, son of Ferdinand and Isabella. The Beaumont party rose up, while the Agramonts split over the marriage. Ferdinand II of Aragon in turn reconsidered his diplomatic policy on Navarre. The crown of Navarre fell back on their default policy of diplomacy, and signed the Treaty of Valencia on 21 March 1488, whereby trade was restored between Navarre and the Aragon-Castile tandem. Still, Ferdinand did not recognize Catherine and installed Castilian troops in Navarre, banning French troops in both the kingdom and the Viscounty of Béarn.

Ferdinand also pushed for the introduction of the coercive cross-border tribunal, the Inquisition, which the Navarrese hated, but, under pressure from the Aragonese monarch, the doors of Navarre (Tudela) finally opened to the Church institution between 1486 and 1488, pushed by the Aragonese monarch&#x27;s threats. Still, in 1510 the authorities of Tudela decreed the expulsion of the monk &quot;calling himself inquisitor.&quot; Catherine and John III also lacked French royal support: both Charles VIII and Louis XII of France pushed hard to have John of Foix declared king. Finally, following a short period of peace with Ferdinand after a treaty was signed, in January 1494 the coronation of the royal family took place in Pamplona. The monarchs Catherine I and John III swore an oath to respect the liberties of Navarre, and the proclamation was celebrated with a week-long festival, while the ceremony was not attended by the Aragonese bishops with jurisdiction in Navarre. During this period, the realm of Navarre-Beárn was defined by Emperor Maximilian I&#x27;s diplomat Müntzer as a nation like Switzerland. In the same treaty, Ferdinand renounced war on Navarre or Béarn from Castile, but the attempt to restore royal authority and patrimony met with the resistance of the defiant Louis de Beaumont, 2nd Count de Lerín, whose estates were confiscated.

Catherine and John III&#x27;s guardian Magdalena of Valois died in 1495 and John&#x27;s father Alain I of Albret signed another treaty with Ferdinand, whereby the count of Lerín should abandon Navarre, receiving in compensation real estate and various enclaves in the recently conquered Granada. In exchange, Alain made an array of painful concessions: Ferdinand received the count of Lerín&#x27;s patrimony and gained control of important fortresses across Navarre, including the right to keep a garrison in Olite at the heart of the kingdom. Also, Queen Catherine&#x27;s one-year-old daughter Magdalena was to be sent to Castile to be raised, with a plan on a future marriage — she would die young in Castile (1504). Following developments in France, the whole treaty was reverted in 1500 and another compromise was reached with Ferdinand, ensuring peace for another four years.

Navarrese Jews were forced to leave or to convert in 1498.

===Spanish conquest===

In spite of the treaties, Ferdinand the Catholic did not relinquish his long-cherished designs on Navarre. In 1506, the 53-year-old widower remarried, to Germaine of Foix (aged 16), daughter of Catherine&#x27;s uncle John of Foix, who had attempted to claim Navarre over his under-age nephew and niece. However, their infant son died shortly after birth, ending hopes of a possible inheritance of Navarre. Ferdinand kept intervening directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of Navarre by means of the Beaumont party. In 1508, the Navarrese royal troops finally suppressed a rebellion of the count of Lerín after a long standoff. In a letter to the rebellious count, the king of Aragon insisted that while he may take over one stronghold or another, he should use &quot;theft, deceit and bargain&quot; instead of violence (23 July 1509).

When Navarre refused to join one of many Holy Leagues against France and declared itself neutral, Ferdinand asked the Pope to excommunicate Albret, which would have legitimised an attack. The Pope was reluctant to label the crown of Navarre as schismatic explicitly in a first bull against the French and the Navarrese (21 July 1512), but Ferdinand&#x27;s pressure bore fruit when a (second) bull named Catherine and John III &quot;heretic&quot; (18 February 1513). On 18 July 1512, Don Fadrique de Toledo was sent to invade Navarre in the context of the second phase of the War of the League of Cambrai.

Unable to face the powerful Castilian-Aragonese army, Jean d&#x27;Albret fled to Béarn (Orthez, Pau, Tarbes). Pamplona, Estella, Olite, Sanguesa, and Tudela were captured by September. The Agramont party sided with Queen Catherine while most, but not all, of the Beaumont party lords supported the occupiers. In October 1512, the legitimate King John III returned with an army recruited north of the Pyrenees and attacked Pamplona without success. By the end of December the Castilians were in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port.

After this failure, the Navarrese &quot;Cortes&quot; (Parliament) had no option but pledge loyalty to King Ferdinand. In 1513, the first Castilian viceroy took a formal oath to respect Navarrese institutions and law (&quot;fueros&quot;). The Spanish Inquisition was extended into Navarre. The Jews had already been forced into conversion or exile by the Alhambra Decree in Castile and Aragon, and now the Jewish community of Navarre and the Muslims of Tudela suffered its persecution.
There were two more attempts at liberation in 1516 and 1521, both supported by popular rebellion, especially the second one. It was in 1521 that the Navarrese came closest to regaining their independence. As a liberation army commanded by General Asparros approached Pamplona, the citizens rose in revolt and besieged the military governor, Iñigo de Loyola, in his newly built castle. Tudela and other cities also declared their loyalty to the House of Albret. While at first distracted due to only recently overcoming the Revolt of the Comuneros, the Navarrese-Béarnese army managed to liberate all the kingdom, but shortly thereafter Asparros faced a large Castilian army at the Battle of Noáin on 30 June 1521. Asparros was captured, and the army completely defeated.

===Independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees===
A small portion of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, Lower Navarre, along with the neighbouring Viscounty of Béarn survived as an independent kingdom which passed by inheritance. Navarre received from King Henry II, the son of Queen Catherine and King John III, a representative assembly, the clergy being represented by the bishops of Bayonne and Dax, their vicars-general, the parish priest of St-Jean-Pied-de-Port, and the priors of Saint-Palais, Utziat and Harambels (Haranbeltz).

Jeanne III converted to Calvinism in 1560, and thereupon commissioned a translation of the New Testament into Basque; one of the first books published in this language. Jeanne also declared Calvinism to be the official religion of Navarre. She and her son, Henry III, led the Huguenot party in the French Wars of Religion. In 1589, Henry became the sole rightful claimant to the crown of France, though he was not recognized as such by many of his subjects until his conversion to Catholicism four years later.

The last independent king of Navarre, Henry III (reigned 1572–1610), succeeded to the throne of France as Henry IV in 1589, founding the Bourbon dynasty. Between 1620 and 1624, Lower Navarre and Béarn were incorporated into France proper by Henry&#x27;s son, Louis XIII of France (Louis II of Navarre). The Parliament of Navarre, seated at Pau, was also created by merging the royal Chancery of Navarre and the Sovereign Council of Béarn.

The 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees put an end to the litigation over the definite French-Spanish borders and to any French-Navarrese dynastic claim over Spanish Navarre. The title of King of Navarre continued to be used by the Kings of France until the French Revolution in 1792, and was revived again during the Restoration, 1814–30. Since the rest of Navarre was in Spanish hands, the kings of Spain would also use the title of King of Navarre, and continue to do so. During the Estates General of 1789, the Estates of Navarre sent Étienne Polverel to Paris to defend the idiosyncrasy and independence of Navarre in the face of the planned homogenizing administrative layout of France.

==The crown and the kingdom: A constitutional foundation==
As the Kingdom of Navarre was originally organized, it was divided into &quot;merindades&quot;, districts governed by a &quot;merino&quot; (&quot;mayorino&quot;, a sheriff), the representative of the king. They were the &quot;Ultrapuertos&quot; (French Navarre), Pamplona, Estella, Tudela and Sangüesa. In 1407 the &quot;merindad&quot; of Olite was added. The Cortes of Navarre began as the king&#x27;s council of churchmen and nobles, but in the course of the 14th century the burgesses were added. Their presence was due to the fact that the king had need of their co-operation to raise money by grants and aids, a development that was being paralleled in England.

The Cortes henceforth consisted of the churchmen, the nobles and the representatives of twenty-seven (later thirty-eight) &quot;good towns&quot;—towns which were free of a feudal lord, and, therefore, held directly by the king. The independence of the burgesses was better secured in Navarre than in other parliaments of Spain by the constitutional rule which required the consent of a majority of &quot;each order&quot; to every act of the Cortes. Thus the burgesses could not be outvoted by the nobles and the Church, as they could be elsewhere. Even in the 18th century the Navarrese successfully resisted Bourbon attempts to establish custom houses on the French frontier, dividing French from Spanish Navarre.

The institutions of Navarre which maintained their autonomy until the 19th century included the Cortes (&quot;The Three States&quot;, precursor to the Parliament of Navarre), Royal Council, Supreme Court and &quot;Diputacion del Reino&quot;. Similar institutions existed in the Crown of Aragon (in Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia) until the Nueva Planta decrees. The Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy, who could object to the decisions made in the Navarrese context.

During that period Navarre enjoyed a special status within the Spanish monarchy; it had its own cortes, taxation system, and separate customs laws. On 17 January, 1645, García de Medrano became the regent of Navarre, and Pedro Antonio de Medrano became regent of Navarre on 9 May 1702.

==Later history and the end of the &quot;fueros&quot;==

By the time of the War of the Pyrenees and the Peninsular War, Navarre was in a deep crisis over the Spanish royal authority, involving the Spanish prime minister Manuel Godoy, who bitterly opposed the Basque charters and their autonomy, and maintained high duty exactions on the Ebro customs against the Navarrese, and the Basques as a whole. The only way out the Navarrese found was an increased trade with France, which in turn spurred the importation of bourgeois, modern ideas. However, the progressive, enlightened bourgeois circles strong in Pamplona—and other Basque towns and cities like Donostia—were eventually quelled during the above wars.

After the French defeat, the only source of support for Navarrese self-government was Ferdinand VII. The king wielded the flag of the ancient régime, as opposed to the liberal Constitution of Cádiz (1812), which ignored the Navarrese and Basque &quot;fueros&quot; and any different identities in Spain, or the &quot;Spains&quot;, as it was considered legally until the 19th century.

During the Napoleonic Wars, many in Navarre took to the bush to avoid tax exactions and the military abuses over property and people during their expeditions, be they French, English, or Spanish. These parties sowed the seeds of the later militias of the Carlist Wars acting under different banners, Carlists most often, but also pro-&quot;fueros&quot; liberals. However, once the local, urban based enlightened bourgeois were suppressed by the Spanish authorities and bristled at despotic French rule during the occupation, the most staunchly Catholic rose to prominence in Navarre, coming under strong clerical influence.

This, and the resentment felt at the loss of their autonomy when they were incorporated into Spain in 1833, account for the strong support given by many Navarrese to the Carlist cause. In 1833, Navarre and the whole Basque region in Spain became the chief stronghold of the Carlists, but in 1837 a Spanish Liberal, centralist constitution was proclaimed in Madrid, and Isabella II recognized as queen. Following the August 31, 1839, armistice putting an end to the First Carlist War, Navarre remained in a shaky state.

Its separate status was acknowledged on the Act promulgated in October that year, but after arrival of Baldomero Espartero and the anti-&quot;fueros&quot; Progressives to office in Madrid, talks with Navarrese Liberal negotiators led to a near-assimilation of Navarre with the Spanish province. Navarre was not a kingdom any more, but another Spanish province. In exchange for giving up self-government, the Navarrese were compensated with the &quot;Compromise Act&quot; () in 1841, a set of tax, administrative and other prerogatives, conjuring an idea of &#x27;compromise between two equal sides&#x27;, and not a granted charter.

==Province of Spain==

Following the 1839–1841 treaties, conflict with Madrid&#x27;s central government over Navarre&#x27;s agreed administrative and fiscal idiosyncrasies contributed to the Third Carlist War (1872–76), largely centred in the Basque districts. Myriad parties and factions emerged in Navarre demanding different degrees of restoration of native institutions and laws. Catholicism and traditionalism became major driving forces behind Navarrese politics.

The Church in Navarre became a mainstay of the reactionary Spanish Nationalists uprising against the Second Spanish Republic (1936). The figure of progressives and inconvenient dissidents exterminated across Navarre is estimated at around 3,000 in the period immediately after the successful military uprising (July 1936). As a reward for its support in the Spanish Civil War, Franco allowed Navarre, as it happened with Álava, to maintain some prerogatives reminiscent of the ancient Navarrese liberties. Navarre&#x27;s specific status during Franco&#x27;s regime led to the present-day Chartered Community of Navarre during the Spanish transition to democracy (the so-called &quot;Amejoramiento&quot;, 1982).

==Territory today==
The territory formerly known as Navarre now belongs to two nations, Spain and France, depending on whether it lies south or north of the Western Pyrenees. The Basque language is still spoken in most of the provinces. Today, Navarre is an autonomous community of Spain and Basse-Navarre is part of France&#x27;s Pyrénées-Atlantiques département. Other former Navarrese territories belong now to several autonomous communities of Spain: the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, La Rioja, Aragon, and Castile and León.

<text>Skálholt (Modern Icelandic: ; ) is a historical site in the south of Iceland, at the river Hvítá.

==History==
Skálholt was, through eight centuries, one of the most important places in Iceland. A bishopric was established in Skálholt in 1056. Until 1785, it was one of Iceland&#x27;s two episcopal sees, along with Hólar, making it a cultural and political center. Iceland&#x27;s first official school, Skálholtsskóli (now Reykjavík Gymnasium, MR), was founded at Skálholt in 1056 to educate clergy. In 1992 the seminary in Skálholt was re-instituted under the old name and now serves as the education and information center of the Church of Iceland.

Throughout the Middle Ages there was significant activity in Skálholt; alongside the bishop&#x27;s office, the cathedral, and the school, there was extensive farming, a smithy, and, while Catholicism lasted, a monastery. Along with dormitories and quarters for teachers and servants, the town made up a sizable gathering of structures. Adam of Bremen, writing circa 1075, described Skálholt (&quot;Scaldholz&quot;) as the &quot;largest city&quot; in Iceland. First the diocese of Skálholt was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen. When in 1104 the Diocese of Lund was elevated to an archdiocese, Lund became the metropolitan of Skálholt, and in 1153 Skálholt became a part of the province of Nidaros.

Continuing as the episcopal see after the Reformation to Lutheranism, the end of Catholicism in Iceland was marked in 1550 when the last Catholic bishop, Jón Arason of Hólar, was executed in Skálholt along with his two sons. The sacred reliquary of St. Thorlac (sixth bishop of Skálholt) was maintained at the cathedral until it too was destroyed in 1550, when his mortal remains were strewn about the cathedral grounds. 

Although no longer episcopal sees, Skálholt and Hólar are still the cathedra of the Church of Iceland&#x27;s two suffragan bishops, and therefore the old cathedrals still serve as such.

Skálholt also receives many visitors each year. Hospitality is a branch of Skálholtsskóli&#x27;s work and visitors can stay in its dormitories, single rooms, and cottages. Many cultural events such as concerts are held in Skálholt. Foremost of these is the Summer Concerts program in July, in which prominent classical musicians, choirs and other musicians are invited to perform.
==Cathedral==

The current cathedral at Skálholt is relatively large in comparison to most Icelandic churches; its span from door to apse is approximately 30 meters. Some of its predecessors were even longer, reaching up to 50 m in length. The new cathedral was built from 1956 to 1963 as a part of the millennial celebrations of the episcopal see. The other Scandinavian churches celebrated this along with the Icelandic church and many of the new cathedral&#x27;s items are gifts of theirs; for example, Gerður Helgadóttir&#x27;s extensive stained glass windows are a gift from the Danes.

==Map==

In the late 16th century Sigurd Stefánsson, a young teacher from Skálholt and grandson of a Skálholt bishop, used the available documentary evidence to mark the sites of the ancient Norse discoveries in the western Atlantic, including Vinland, on a map. After studying at the University of Copenhagen, Sigurd became a teacher at the former monastery of Skálholt, which remained the religious and educational centre in Iceland even after Protestantism was introduced in 1551.

The 1570 original of Sigurd&#x27;s Map no longer survives, but a copy was made in 1690 by Þórður Þorláksson (also known by his Latinized name, Thorlacius), the Bishop of Skálholt, and is now in the collection of the Danish Royal Library. Numerous other copies were made by Scandinavian scholars. By matching latitudes with the British Isles, the map shows the northern tip of &quot;Vinland&quot; as being at about 51 degrees north, the same latitude as the southern tip of Ireland and Bristol, England. When this information was transferred to more modern maps, it indicated, among other things, that Sigurd had marked the promontory of Vinland at the same position as the northern promontory of Newfoundland, which was one of the factors that encouraged successful archaeological investigations by Anne Stine and Helge Ingstad in the 1960s at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, which is located at .

<doc id="693532" wikidata="Q1714630" url="?curid=693532" title="Resource acquisition is initialization">
<text>Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom used in several object-oriented, statically typed programming languages to describe a particular language behavior. In RAII, holding a resource is a class invariant, and is tied to object lifetime. Resource allocation (or acquisition) is done during object creation (specifically initialization), by the constructor, while resource deallocation (release) is done during object destruction (specifically finalization), by the destructor. In other words, resource acquisition must succeed for initialization to succeed. Thus, the resource is guaranteed to be held between when initialization finishes and finalization starts (holding the resources is a class invariant), and to be held only when the object is alive. Thus, if there are no object leaks, there are no resource leaks.

RAII is associated most prominently with C++, where it originated, but also Ada, Vala, and Rust. The technique was developed for exception-safe resource management in C++ during 1984–1989, primarily by Bjarne Stroustrup and Andrew Koenig, and the term itself was coined by Stroustrup.

Other names for this idiom include &quot;Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases&quot; (CADRe) and one particular style of use is called &quot;Scope-based Resource Management&quot; (SBRM). This latter term is for the special case of automatic variables. RAII ties resources to object &quot;lifetime,&quot; which may not coincide with entry and exit of a scope. (Notably variables allocated on the free store have lifetimes unrelated to any given scope.) However, using RAII for automatic variables (SBRM) is the most common use case.

==C++11 example==
The following C++11 example demonstrates usage of RAII for file access and mutex locking:

#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;
#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

void WriteToFile(const std::string&amp; message) {
 // |mutex| is to protect access to |file| (which is shared across threads).
 static std::mutex mutex;

 // Lock |mutex| before accessing |file|.
 std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mutex);

 // Try to open file.
 std::ofstream file(&quot;example.txt&quot;);
 if (!file.is_open()) {
 throw std::runtime_error(&quot;unable to open file&quot;);

 // Write |message| to |file|.
 file « message « std::endl;

 // |file| will be closed first when leaving scope (regardless of exception)
 // |mutex| will be unlocked second (from |lock| destructor) when leaving scope
 // (regardless of exception).


This code is exception-safe because C++ guarantees that all objects with automatic storage duration (local variables) are destroyed at the end of the enclosing scope in the reverse order of their construction.
The destructors of both the &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;file&quot; objects are therefore guaranteed to be called when returning from the function, whether an exception has been thrown or not.

Local variables allow easy management of multiple resources within a single function: they are destroyed in the reverse order of their construction, and an object is destroyed only if fully constructed—that is, if no exception propagates from its constructor.

Using RAII greatly simplifies resource management, reduces overall code size and helps ensure program correctness. RAII is therefore recommended by industry-standard guidelines,
and most of the C++ standard library follows the idiom.

==Benefits==
The advantages of RAII as a resource management technique are that it provides encapsulation, exception safety (for stack resources), and locality (it allows acquisition and release logic to be written next to each other).

Encapsulation is provided because resource management logic is defined once in the class, not at each call site. Exception safety is provided for stack resources (resources that are released in the same scope as they are acquired) by tying the resource to the lifetime of a stack variable (a local variable declared in a given scope): if an exception is thrown, and proper exception handling is in place, the only code that will be executed when exiting the current scope are the destructors of objects declared in that scope. Finally, locality of definition is provided by writing the constructor and destructor definitions next to each other in the class definition.

Resource management therefore needs to be tied to the lifespan of suitable objects in order to gain automatic allocation and reclamation. Resources are acquired during initialization, when there is no chance of them being used before they are available, and released with the destruction of the same objects, which is guaranteed to take place even in case of errors.

Comparing RAII with the codice_1 construct used in Java, Stroustrup wrote that “In realistic systems, there are far more resource acquisitions than kinds of resources, so the &#x27;resource acquisition is initialization&#x27; technique leads to less code than use of a &#x27;finally&#x27; construct.”

==Typical uses==

The RAII design is often used for controlling mutex locks in multi-threaded applications. In that use, the object releases the lock when destroyed. Without RAII in this scenario the potential for deadlock would be high and the logic to lock the mutex would be far from the logic to unlock it. With RAII, the code that locks the mutex essentially includes the logic that the lock will be released when execution leaves the scope of the RAII object.

Another typical example is interacting with files: We could have an object that represents a file that is open for writing, wherein the file is opened in the constructor and closed when execution leaves the object&#x27;s scope. In both cases, RAII ensures only that the resource in question is released appropriately; care must still be taken to maintain exception safety. If the code modifying the data structure or file is not exception-safe, the mutex could be unlocked or the file closed with the data structure or file corrupted.

Ownership of dynamically allocated objects (memory allocated with codice_2 in C++) can also be controlled with RAII, such that the object is released when the RAII (stack-based) object is destroyed. For this purpose, the C++11 standard library defines the smart pointer classes codice_3 for single-owned objects and codice_4 for objects with shared ownership. Similar classes are also available through codice_5 in C++98, and codice_6 in the Boost libraries.

Also, messages can be sent to network resources using RAII. In this case, the RAII object would send a message to a socket at the end of the constructor, when its initialization is completed. It would also send a message at the beginning of the destructor, when the object is about to be destroyed. Such a construct might be used in a client object to establish a connection with a server running in another process.

== Compiler &quot;cleanup&quot; extensions ==
Both Clang and the GNU Compiler Collection implement a non-standard extension to the C language to support RAII: the &quot;cleanup&quot; variable attribute. The following annotates a variable with a given destructor function that it will call when the variable goes out of scope:
void example_usage() {
 __attribute__((cleanup(fclosep))) FILE *logfile = fopen(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;);
 fputs(&quot;hello logfile!&quot;, logfile);

In this example, the compiler arranges for the &quot;fclosep&quot; function to be called on &quot;logfile&quot; before &quot;example_usage&quot; returns.

== Limitations ==
RAII only works for resources acquired and released (directly or indirectly) by stack-allocated objects,
where there &quot;is&quot; a well-defined static object lifetime.
Heap-allocated objects which themselves acquire and release resources are common in many languages, including C++. RAII depends on heap-based objects to be implicitly or explicitly deleted along all possible execution paths, in order to trigger its resource-releasing destructor (or equivalent). This can be achieved by using smart pointers to manage all heap objects, with weak pointers for cyclically referenced objects.

In C++, stack unwinding is only guaranteed to occur if the exception is caught somewhere. This is because &quot;If no matching handler is found in a program, the function terminate() is called; whether or not the stack is unwound before this call to terminate() is implementation-defined (15.5.1).&quot; (C++03 standard, §15.3/9). This behavior is usually acceptable, since the operating system releases remaining resources like memory, files, sockets, etc. at program termination.

At the 2018 Gamelab conference, Jonathan Blow claimed that use of RAII can cause memory fragmentation which in turn can cause cache misses and a 100 times or worse hit on performance.

== Reference counting ==
Perl, Python (in the CPython implementation), and PHP manage object lifetime by reference counting, which makes it possible to use RAII. Objects that are no longer referenced are immediately destroyed or finalized and released, so a destructor or finalizer can release the resource at that time. However, it is not always idiomatic in such languages, and is specifically discouraged in Python (in favor of context managers and &quot;finalizers&quot; from the &quot;weakref&quot; package).

However, object lifetimes are not necessarily bound to any scope, and objects may be destroyed non-deterministically or not at all. This makes it possible to accidentally leak resources that should have been released at the end of some scope. Objects stored in a static variable (notably a global variable) may not be finalized when the program terminates, so their resources are not released; CPython makes no guarantee of finalizing such objects, for instance. Further, objects with circular references will not be collected by a simple reference counter, and will live indeterminately long; even if collected (by more sophisticated garbage collection), destruction time and destruction order will be non-deterministic. In CPython there is a cycle detector which detects cycles and finalizes the objects in the cycle, though prior to CPython 3.4, cycles are not collected if any object in the cycle has a finalizer.

<text>The Fourth World is the debut studio album and major label debut by the band Kara&#x27;s Flowers, who later became Maroon 5. The album contains 11 tracks, plus one bonus track on the Japanese edition. 

Following their 1995 self-released demo album &quot;We Like Digging?&quot;, Kara&#x27;s Flowers signed with Reprise Records, teamed up with the people who worked with Green Day and released &quot;The Fourth World&quot; on August 19, 1997. The band had little success with the album and parted with the record label two years later. They continued to explore different musical styles until finally coming together again with James Valentine under the name Maroon 5.

== Soap Disco ==
The lead single, &quot;Soap Disco&quot;, was released on July 22, 1997. A music video was produced for the single, depicting the group walking through a park and performing in an orange and green room. A storm appears at the end of the video. The video was directed by Mark Kohr (who has directed music videos for Alanis Morissette and Green Day). The video made airplay on &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. The song was included in Volume 50 of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;.

The band made an appearance from the television series &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, where they performed the song in the episode &quot;Forgive and Forget&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Giving the album a B+, Tom Lanham with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the &quot;optimistic, lyrically awkward kids spend 10 more happy tracks turning the tables on lethargic slacker cynicism, with Green Day producer Rob Cavallo bridling all that youthful zeal.&quot;

<text>Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts (originally known as the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts and simply known as Wolf Trap) is a performing arts center located on of national park land in unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia, near the town of Vienna. Through a partnership and collaboration of the National Park Service and the non-profit Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, the park offers both natural and cultural resources.

Its land was donated to the United States government by Catherine Filene Shouse, who sought to preserve her former farm as parkland. In 1966, Congress accepted Shouse&#x27;s gift and authorized Wolf Trap Farm Park as the first national park for the performing arts. It was given its present name on August 21, 2002.

==Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts==
The Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts is a nonprofit organization founded by Catherine Filene Shouse when she donated her Wolf Trap Farm to the National Park Service. The Park is operated as a public/private partnership between the Park Service, which staffs and operates the park grounds, and the Foundation, which produces and presents the performance and education programs.

The Foundation presents performances in the Filene Center from May through September and year-round at The Barns at Wolf Trap, just outside the park proper. The Foundation also operates the Wolf Trap Opera Company, a resident company for young opera singers.

The Foundation&#x27;s education programs, also located next to the park proper, include the Wolf Trap Institute for Early Learning Through the Arts, a nationally recognized college internship program, and the Children&#x27;s Theatre-in-the-Woods, whose performance venue is in the park.

==Performing arts venues==
Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts organizes and runs several venues and facilities:

===Filene Center===

The park&#x27;s major indoor/outdoor performance venue is Filene Center, which can hold 7,028 in 3,800 seats under cover and space for another 3,200 to sit on the lawn. It is named for Shouse&#x27;s parents, Abraham and Thérèse Lincoln Filene of the now-defunct department store chain Performances are given nightly from May to early September and cover a wide range of musical styles from country music to opera.

The first Filene Center, constructed of Oregon redcedar, was a ten-story-high facility equipped with a computerized lighting system and sophisticated sound equipment. Just months before the theater was to open, it was partially destroyed by a fire on March 13, 1971. On May 10, a benefit concert to cover the repair costs of around $650,000 was held at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.; it featured Pierre Boulez conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. The center opened on schedule on July 1, although the inaugural season opening was delayed one month.

That summer, 60 young musical performers were chosen for training in music, dance and acting, to culminate in a production at the center. 

On April 14, 1982, the Filene Center was destroyed by fire. A temporary structure was built on the park to house performances for the upcoming season. 
The second Filene Center, constructed between 1982 and 1984, is made of douglas-fir with a yellow pine ceiling. It includes a system to detect and suppress fire, as well as fire retardant wood, which all cost about a total of $1.7 million. The new amphitheater was also built with state-of-the-art sound and lighting equipment. It holds several hundred more patrons than the original Filene Center, provides better access for handicapped people, and adds backstage space for performers and crews.

The main stage is 116 feet wide, 64 deep and 102 high.

===Children&#x27;s Theatre in the Woods===

Set amid 117 rolling wooded acres,Children&#x27;s Theatre in the Woods presents dozens of family-friendly shows each season from late June through early August. Shows have included music, dance, storytelling, puppetry, and theater, all recommended for children between kindergarten and 6th grade.

===Meadow Pavilion===

Until 2010, the Meadow Pavilion, a covered outdoor stage adjacent to Children&#x27;s Theatre in the Woods, hosted events for the International Children&#x27;s Festival at Wolf Trap (known as International Children&#x27;s Day from 1971 to 1974). Today, the Meadow Pavilion can be rented through the Wolf Trap Foundation.

On March 6, 1980, a welder&#x27;s torch ignited a fire at the Meadow Pavilion, causing around $10,000 in damage.

===The Barns at Wolf Trap===
Built from two restored 18th-century barns, this 382-seat theater holds performances between October and May. Shouse bought the barns in upstate New York and had them moved to the current site in 1981 using the 18th-century &quot;block and tackle&quot; method of construction. The theater barn was originally built in 1780 and seats 285 on the threshing floor and another 98 in the hayloft. The gathering barn is of the Scottish style and features a kitchen, bar and atrium.

==History==


Early records of Fairfax County, Virginia say that wolves would run wild in the area, and bounties were granted for trapping them. An August 1739 survey by J.M. Warner mentions &quot;Wolf Trap Creek,&quot; a branch of the Difficult Run tributary stream. 

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the land at Wolf Trap was frequently exchanged between wealthy families in the Fairfax area, including Bryan Fairfax, the 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron and longtime friend of George Washington. 

=== 20th century ===
In 1930, Catherine Filene Shouse acquired about of land in the region and chose to preserve the name. By 1956, her holdings encompassed .

Shouse bought Wolf Trap to offer her children a weekend retreat from their home in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. There they grew corn, wheat, alfalfa, and oats to feed their chickens, ducks, turkeys, and milk cows. They bred horses, built a stable and a hay barn, and opened a dog-breeding kennel, producing champion boxers, miniature pinschers, and Weimaraners. Shouse and her husband, Jouett Shouse, hosted large social gatherings for friends, family, and prominent public figures, including World War II Generals Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall and several members of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944.

==== Donation of Wolf Trap to Congress, 1966–1970 ====
In 1966, after several meetings with Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Mrs. Shouse donated of Wolf Trap land, in addition to from the American Symphony Orchestra League, to the U.S. Government, a donation Congress subsequently accepted that year. In a letter to Congress that year, Udall argued that Wolf Trap would &quot;augment the park and recreation opportunities in the National Capital region and involve the expenditure of only a minimum of Federal funds.&quot; On May 28, 1966, Virginia Senator A. Willis Robertson introduced a bill to Congress to create and fund Wolf Trap, which passed with relative ease. Mrs. Shouse also offered over $2 million to construct the Filene Center for performances.

Around the same time, the Kennedy Center and Merriweather Post Pavilion, two other nearby concert venues, were also being constructed, so there were some questions in Congress about overloading the area with too many arts and music venues. Rep. George H. Fallon of Maryland, for example, opposed the Wolf Trap bill on the basis that it would &quot;only have the effect of dividing a small market&quot; and would be in &quot;direct conflict&quot; with the Kennedy Center and Merriweather Post Pavilion. Nevertheless, Wolf Trap became and remains the first and only U.S. National Park dedicated to the performance arts. With this collaboration, Mrs. Shouse became the first person to establish a partnership with the U.S. in bringing performing arts to the nation.

Ground was broken for the construction of the Filene Center in 1968, and the next year, Wolf Trap held its first concert. A ceremony was held for the topping out of the Filene Center in May 1970, attended by then-First Lady Pat Nixon.

==== First performance seasons ====

The inaugural performance at Wolf Trap occurred on June 1–2, 1971, and featured Van Cliburn, Julius Rudel and Norman Treigle conducting the New York City Opera. Follow-up performances were conducted by National Symphony Orchestra, Choral Arts Society of Washington, United States Marine Band and the Madison Madrigal Singers.

For the first several performances at the Filene Center, Robert Lewis, founder of the Actors Studio and acclaimed Broadway director, was chosen to conduct the training program and direct the production called &quot;Musical Theatre Cavalcade&quot;. With a multimedia set by Leo Kerz, choreography by Gemeze de Lappe, and musical direction by Johnny Green, the &quot;Cavalcade&quot; was a history of musical theater from &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; to &quot;Hair&quot;. Pat Nixon, wife of President Richard Nixon, attended the opening night performance and invited the entire cast afterwards to the White House for a reception.

The first 12 seasons saw many performances and events of historical significance. In 1971, the National Folk Festival was the first event at Wolf Trap to use the park grounds (versus Filene Center itself) for performances, and it set a precedent for other events at Wolf Trap to do the same. That same year, Richard Nixon became the first U.S. president to attend a Wolf Trap performance, viewing the Wolf Trap Company&#x27;s performance of the &quot;Musical Theater Cavacade&quot; on August 12. In 1976, the Scottish Military Tattoo, a Bicentennial gift from the United Kingdom, performed at the Filene Center for a capacity audience which included Britain&#x27;s Prince Philip. Two years later, in 1978, the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s performing arts ensemble made its first performance outside China when it entertained Wolf Trap&#x27;s audience with acrobatic troupes and dancers. From 1971 until the early 1980s, the National Folk Festival was held annually at Wolf Trap. In the 1970s, WETA-TV produced the television series &quot;In Performance at Wolf Trap&quot;.

Other highlights included Sarah Caldwell&#x27;s production of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s opera &quot;War and Peace&quot;, the Royal Ballet, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the annual US National Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; concerts with live cannons and Beverly Sills&#x27; 1981 farewell appearance.

==== Composers&#x27; Cottage, 1971–1979 ====
In May 1971, plans were developed to construct a series of composers&#x27; cottages across the park, where performing artists could stay for a temporary period and peacefully work on their respective works. Although five cottages were planned, only one was ever built. The two-bedroom house was donated by Edward R. Carr Jr., a metropolitan area realtor, and built by Fairfax County Public Schools high school students; it was finished and dedicated in December 1973. During the next five years, the composers&#x27; cottage hosted several noteworthy composers, including Lester Trimble, Irwin Bazelon and Elie Siegmeister.

In 1979, however, a fire destroyed the composers&#x27; cottage, and it was never rebuilt.

==== 1982 Filene Center fire ====
As Wolf Trap was preparing for its 12th season, tragedy struck once again. On April 4, 1982, a fire of undetermined origin, intensified by high gusting winds, destroyed the Filene Center.

During the rebuilding of the Filene Center between 1982 and 1984, Wolf Trap received $29 million in contributions and pledges from over 16,000 donors in 47 states and five foreign countries, including a $9 million grant from Congress and support from then-President Ronald Reagan and former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. WETA-TV also sponsored a star-studded, three-hour national telethon that raised more than $390,000 for the reconstruction of the Filene Center.

Almost immediately, the Wolf Trap Foundation, the park&#x27;s non-profit partner, announced that a 1982 season would still take place in the Meadow Center, a huge tent erected in the nearby meadow. The prefabricated structure, purchased with private and government funds, was disassembled from its previous site in the United Arab Emirates and transported to Wolf Trap by the government of Saudi Arabia. Volunteers provided much of the labor to erect the structure.

After the fire, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Wolf Trap on September 1, 1982. The stamp was the first in a series honoring Washington, D.C.&#x27;s cultural attractions, including the National Gallery of Art and the National Air and Space Museum.

The first performance at the newly designed and constructed Filene Center, titled the &quot;Filene Center Dedication,&quot; occurred on June 20, 1984. The design work was accomplished by Dewberry and Davis, Joseph Boggs Studio, Architects. The new building featured state of the art fireproof design and acoustics. Attendees included opera star and frequent Wolf Trap performer Beverly Sills and then-Virginia Governor Charles Robb, as well as Mrs. Shouse herself.

===21st century===

In the years running up to 2009, Wolf Trap hosted an average of 96 shows during its performance season, which runs from late May to early September. However, because fewer artists toured in 2009, Wolf Trap only held 86 performances and reported a revenue decrease of about ten percent.

On September 24, 2011, in conjunction with National Public Lands Day and First Lady Michelle Obama&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Move! campaign, Wolf Trap held its first annual &quot;Let&#x27;s Move with Music at Wolf Trap!&quot; event.

After touring for sixteen years in North America, &quot;Riverdance&quot; had its final U.S. performance on July 17, 2012, at Wolf Trap.

==== Free tickets to secretary of the interior ====

The secretary of the interior has for decades been given eight free tickets for every event at Wolf Trap by the Wolf Trap Foundation.

This came to public light in a September 4, 2018, report by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of the Interior. The benefit was worth about $43,000 per year at the time of the report. The report raised ethics concerns about the tickets, since United States law generally prohibits government employees from receiving gifts. The inspector general&#x27;s office recommended a review of the setup by ethics officials within the agency, and the department agreed to conduct the review.

Despite the concerns, the National Park Service signed a new agreement with the Wolf Trap Foundation on May 3, 2019, that continued to provide the secretary&#x27;s eight tickets for each performance for twenty more years. A Park Service spokesperson said the department conducted an ethical and legal review and &quot;it was confirmed that the tickets are government property and may be used by the Department for authorized purposes.&quot;

<doc id="693557" wikidata="Q3567209" url="?curid=693557" title="Union of Centrists">
<text>The Union of Centrists (, ) is a centrist, liberal political party in Greece. The leader and founder of the party is the veteran anti-corruption activist Vassilis Leventis. It strongly supports Greece in remaining an integral part of the European Union.

== History ==
The party was founded by Vassilis Leventis in 1992 under the title &quot;Union of Centrists and Ecologists&quot; (). The name was changed shortly after. The Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Centre Union. Previously Vassilis Leventis was a part of the PASOK party when it was launched, but Vassilis Leventis left and started the Union of Centrists because of disagreements.

The party strives to become &quot;the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece&quot;. Leventis aimed to become part of the Venizelist legacy of some Greek politicians of the past, such as Eleftherios Venizelos and George Papandreou (senior).

== Electoral support ==

Until 2015, the party&#x27;s influence was marginal, with 1.79% of the total vote in the January 2015 Greek legislative election and no MPs being its highest achievement. In the September 2015 Greek legislative election the party cleared the 3% hurdle for representation in the Greek Parliament with nine MPs after it won 186,457 votes (3.43%). Two MPs left the parliamentary group: Georgios Dimitrios Karras in November 2016 and Theodora Megaloeconomou in July 2017, the latter becoming a Syriza MP in January 2018. The party currently has five MPs.

In the 2019 election, the party did not reach the 3% threshold and thus lost representation in the Hellenic Parliament.

<doc id="693567" wikidata="Q828748" url="?curid=693567" title="Continuing education">
<text>Continuing education is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and Canada.

Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, college remediation, workforce training, and formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online).

General continuing education is similar to adult education, at least in being intended for adult learners, especially those beyond traditional undergraduate college or university age.

Frequently, in the United States and Canada continuing education courses are delivered through a division or school of continuing education of a college or university known sometimes as the university extension or extension school. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development argued, however, that continuing education should be &quot;&#x27;fully integrated into institutional life rather than being often regarded as a separate and distinctive operation employing different staff&#x27; if it is to feed into mainstream programmes and be given the due recognition deserved by this type of provision&quot;.

Georgetown University, Michigan State University, and the University of Denver have benefited from non-credit programs as it relates to strengthening partnerships with corporations and government agencies, helping to inform and shape the curriculum for degree programs, and generating revenue to support the academic enterprise.

==History==
In the United Kingdom, Oxford University&#x27;s Department for Continuing Education was founded in 1878, and the Institute of Continuing Education of Cambridge University dates to the 1873.

In the United States, the Chautauqua Institution, originally the Chautauqua Lake Sunday School Assembly, was founded in 1874 &quot;as an educational experiment in out-of-school, vacation learning. It was successful and broadened almost immediately beyond courses for Sunday school teachers to include academic subjects, music, art and physical education.&quot;

Harvard University traces its origins in continuing education to 1835 when John Lowell Jr. established the Lowell Institute with a mission to provide free public lectures in Boston. In 1909, then-Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, who was also a trustee of the Lowell Institute, expanded plans to offer Lowell Institute public courses directly with Harvard. In 1910, Lowell formally established the Havard Extension School, then referred to as the Commission on Extension Courses. The Harvard Extension School now operates under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and is one of the 13 degree-granting schools that makes up Harvard University. The School has remained in continuous operation since 1910. 

Cornell University was among higher education institutions that began offering university-based continuing education, primarily to teachers, through extension courses in the 1870s. As noted in the &quot;Cornell Era&quot; of February 16, 1877, the university offered a &quot;Tour of the Great Lakes&quot; program for &quot;teachers and others&quot; under the direction of Professor Theodore B. Comstock, head of Cornell&#x27;s department of geology.

The University of Wisconsin–Madison began its continuing education program in 1907. The New School for Social Research, founded in 1919, was initially devoted to adult education. In 1969, Empire State College, a unit of the State University of New York, was the first institution in the US to exclusively focus on providing higher education to adult learners. In 1976 the University of Florida created its own Division of Continuing Education and most courses were offered on evenings or weekends to accommodate the schedules of working students.

The method of delivery of continuing education can include traditional types of classroom lectures and laboratories. However, many continuing education programs make heavy use of distance education, which not only includes independent study, but can also include videotaped material, broadcast programming or online education which has more recently dominated the distance learning community.

==For professionals==
Within the domain of continuing education, professional continuing education is a specific learning activity generally characterized by the issuance of a certificate or continuing education units (CEU) for the purpose of documenting attendance at a designated seminar or course of instruction. Licensing bodies in a number of fields (such as teaching and healthcare) impose continuing education requirements on members who hold licenses to continue practicing a particular profession. These requirements are intended to encourage professionals to expand their foundations of knowledge and stay up-to-date on new developments.

Depending on the field, these requirements may be satisfied through college or university coursework, extension courses or conferences and seminars attendance. Although individual professions may have different standards, the most widely accepted standard, developed by the International Association for Continuing Education &amp; Training, is that ten contact hours equals one Continuing Education Unit. Not all professionals use the CEU convention. For example, the American Psychological Association accredits sponsors of continuing education and uses simply a CE approach. In contrast to the CEU, the CE credit is typically one CE credit for each hour of contact.

In the spring of 2009, Eduventures, a higher education consulting firm, released the results of a study that illustrated that the recession had made a significant impact on the views of prospective continuing education students. A survey of 1,500 adults who planned to enroll in a course or program within the next two years determined that while nearly half of respondents believed that the value of education had risen due to the recession, over two-thirds said the state of the economy had affected their plans to pursue continuing education.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on the future of work explains that flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs that allow workers to retrain and retool are vital in order for labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

<text>Mantes-la-Ville () is a commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France. It is located in the western suburbs of Paris from the center.

Mantes-la-Ville is located at the confluence of the Seine and the Vaucouleurs. The Paris–Rouen rail line separates Mantes-la-Ville from the larger commune of Mantes-la-Jolie. The A13 autoroute to Normandy also passes through Mantes-la-Ville.

==Population==

Inhabitants are called &quot;Mantevillois&quot;. Approximately one-third of the town&#x27;s population is Muslim.

==Economy==
Mantes-la-Ville is the headquarters of two world-renowned makers of wind instruments: Henri Selmer and Buffet Crampon.

Eduard Beaugnier et Cie, another saxophone manufacturer, was also based in Mantes until the company closed down in the early 1970s. Beaugnier manufactured saxophones under their own name, and also as &quot;stencils&quot; for other companies under names such as Noblet, Vito and Revere. Though not as well known as the instruments of Henri Selmer, Beaugnier instruments have a good reputation amongst saxophone enthusiasts. Another high-quality saxophone manufacturer based in Mantes was Dolnet, whose factory closed down in the late 1970s.

There is an industrial park on the old site of Cellophane.

==Twin towns==

* Chigwell, Essex, England
* Hillingdon, Greater London, England

<text>James Gustave (Gus) Speth (born on March 4, 1942) is an American environmental lawyer and advocate who co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1942. He graduated summa cum laude from Yale University in 1964, attended Balliol College at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and graduated from Yale Law School, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall and the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, in 1969.

== Career ==
In 1969 and 1970, Speth served as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black. He was a co-founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council, where he served as senior attorney from 1970 to 1977.

He served from 1977 to 1981 as a member and then for two years as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive Office of the President. As chair, he was a principal adviser on matters affecting the environment and had overall responsibility for developing and coordinating the President&#x27;s environmental program. In 1981 and 1982, he was a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center, teaching environmental and constitutional law. Many conservatives considered Speth to be a radical in regards to his approach to environnmetal laws.

In 1982, he founded the World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.–based environmental think tank, and served as its president until January 1993. He was a senior adviser to President-elect Bill Clinton&#x27;s transition team, heading the group that examined the U.S.&#x27;s role in natural resources, energy and the environment.

In 1991, he chaired a U.S. task force on international development and environmental security which produced the report &quot;Partnership for Sustainable Development: A New U.S. Agenda&quot;.

In 1990 he led the Western Hemisphere Dialogue on Environment and Development which produced the report &quot;Compact for a New World&quot;.

From 1993 to 1999, he served as Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme; he served as special coordinator for economic and social affairs under Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, managed the United Nations Development Assistance Plan and also served as chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group.

In 1999, he became the dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. He served the school as the Carl W. Knobloch, Jr. Dean and Sara Shallenberger Brown Professor in the Practice of Environmental Policy when he retired from Yale in 2009 to assume a professorship at Vermont Law School in South Royalton, Vermont. Speth was succeeded as Dean at Yale by Sir Peter Crane.

In 2014 he published his memoir &quot;Angels by the River&quot;. In that year, he was also board member of the New Economy Coalition.

Speth currently serves on the advisory council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization.

Speth has been a leader or participant in many task forces and committees aimed at combating environmental degradation, including the President&#x27;s Task Force on Global Resources and Environment; the Western Hemisphere Dialogue on Environment and Development; and the National Commission on the Environment.

==Awards==
Among his awards are the National Wildlife Federation’s Resources Defense Award, the Natural Resources Council of America&#x27;s Barbara Swain Award of Honor, a 1997 Special Recognition Award from the Society for International Development, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Environmental Law Institute, and the Blue Planet Prize. He holds honorary degrees from Clark University, the College of the Atlantic, Vermont Law School, Middlebury College, and the University of Massachusetts Boston.

<text>Gerald Cock MVO (1887 – 10 November 1973) was a British broadcasting executive, who initially worked for BBC Radio, before being made the corporation&#x27;s very first Director of Television, in effect the very first Controller of the television channel initially known as the BBC Television Service but later renamed BBC1.

== Early life ==
After being educated at Tonbridge School and Seafield Park, Cock left the UK in 1909 to travel around North America. He went to British Columbia, the United States and Mexico, working variously in such jobs as a rancher, a gold miner and even as an extra in Hollywood films, before in 1915 returning to the UK due to the First World War. Cock joined the Royal Engineers and served in France and later Belgium, being promoted to the rank of captain in 1917.

== Career ==
Cock left the army in 1920 and worked in various jobs in London, before joining the newly formed British Broadcasting Company (later Corporation). As the BBC began to extend its radio service throughout the country and provide a greater scope and variety of programmes, Cock was appointed as its first Director of Outside Broadcasts in 1925. He organised several new and ambitious events, such as the coverage of live sporting events and the increasing competition with the newspapers for coverage of important news, as well as encouraging the development of new techniques and technologies.

In 1935, possibly because of his enthusiasm for new broadcasting techniques, Cock was asked if he would like to become the BBC&#x27;s Director of Television, as the corporation was planning to introduce a new regular service using this medium the following year. Cock accepted, and this placed him charge of establishing the world&#x27;s very first regular high-definition television service from scratch.

Based at the BBC&#x27;s new television studios in a specially converted section of Alexandra Palace in London, Cock and his team thought that they had several months to learn about what making television would involve before the planned launch in November 1936, but soon after the initial meeting he was informed that programmes would be required for the Radiolympia exhibition in August, which was then only ten days away.

Despite the tight schedule, Cock and his team were able to prepare several sample programmes, and the Radiolympia event was a great success in advertising the potential of the new medium and encouraging the audience to purchase sets in the run-up to the launch proper. On 2 November 1936 that launch took place, the new television service broadcasting in theory only within a twenty-five-mile radius of Alexandra Palace, although in practice the transmissions could be picked up a good deal further afield than this.

Initially two competing technical systems, the Marconi 405-line and the Baird 210-line intermediate film system, were used in alternate weeks, but the Marconi system was vastly superior and Baird&#x27;s was quickly abandoned. Cock oversaw an increasingly ambitions programme of scheduling including various variety shows, the popular magazine programme &quot;Picture Page&quot;, and an increasingly varied number of dramas. These achievements are all the more impressive when it is considered that, apart from a couple of demonstration films and some newsreels, everything had to be transmitted live as at the time no broadcast-quality format existed for the recording of television programmes.

Cock also made impressive forays into outside broadcasts, including coverage on 12 May 1937 of the coronation parade of King George VI, which used every single camera the television service had available and a huge length of cable to relay the pictures back to Alexandra Palace for broadcast. He also established the coverage of prominent sporting events, including the first ever televising of Wimbledon (21 June 1937), the Boat Race (2 April 1938), the FA Cup Final (30 April 1938) and test match cricket (24 June 1938). Major live news events also began to be covered – BBC television cameras were present when Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich to deliver his infamous &quot;peace in our time&quot; speech in October 1938.

This increasingly varied and ambitious schedule put together by Cock and his small but inventive team of producers meant that television very quickly grew in popularity, despite at the time being an expensive luxury limited to the London area. By September 1939 there were estimated to be 25,000 television sets in use – however, that month also saw the BBC Television Service unceremoniously shut down by the government for the duration of the war, following the broadcasting of a Mickey Mouse cartoon on 1 September, two days before hostilities commenced. There were two main reasons for this – the first and principal reason was the fear that German bombers could use the VHF transmission waves of television as a perfect guiding beam for homing into the centre of London. However, there was also a great need for many of the technical and engineering staff of the service to be used on war efforts such as the radar programme, and so the young BBC Television Service was blacked-out until 1946.

During the war, with no television service to run, Cock was appointed as the North American representative of the BBC in New York City from 1940 to 1941, and then later from 1942 to 1945 was the corporation&#x27;s Pacific Coast representative, working in California. While in the USA he took the opportunity of seeing the developments made in television broadcasting by the new American broadcasters, compiling a report upon his return home to the UK entitled &quot;Report on the Conditions For a Post-War Television Service.&quot; Although this report was very important in helping to re-establish the BBC Television Service in 1946, Cock did not return to control it. Instead he had retired, as he was in poor health, although he went on to live in retirement until his death in 1973.

==Early years==
Born in Center Moriches, New York, Wicks played for Rutgers University from 1984 to 1988. While at Rutgers, she was named a Kodak All-American in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and in 1988 she won the Naismith, U.S. Basketball Writers Association, Women&#x27;s Basketball News Service and Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s National Player of the Year awards. She was Player of the Year in the Atlantic 10 Conference in 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning the Atlantic 10 Tournament MVP award in 1986 and 1988, and sharing it in 1987. She also was named to All-Regional Teams in the NCAA tournament in 1986 and 1987. She holds the Rutgers records for points scored (2,655), rebounds (1,357), scoring average (21.2 ppg), rebounding average (10.9 rpg), field goals made (1,091) and attempted (2,099), free throws made (473) and attempted (641), and blocked shots (293).

She was a gold medalist in the 1987 Pan-American Games.

Following her college career, she played professionally in Italy, Japan, Spain and Israel before the WNBA was founded. In 1997, she was signed for the inaugural WNBA season by the New York Liberty, to fill the role of back-up center. The Liberty played at the WNBA championship game, losing to the Houston Comets, 65–51.

==WNBA career==

On April 28, 1997, Wicks was drafted with the 6th overall pick of the 1997 WNBA Draft to the New York Liberty. She would go on to play 6 seasons in the WNBA, all 6 of them being a member of the Liberty. Her debut game was played on June 21, 1997, in a 67–57 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks where she recorded 2 points, 1 rebound, 1 steal and 1 block.

Wicks mostly came off the bench for the Liberty but did start 45 of 182 regular season games, including 30 starts (out of 32 games played) in 1999. Wicks starting in 1999 was due in part to her defensive skills. She developed into a fan favorite and was voted by the fans as a starter in the 2000 WNBA all-star game. In 2000, she received the WNBA&#x27;s top award for sportsmanship, the Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award.

In 1997, 1999 and 2000, Wicks and the Liberty reached the WNBA Finals, only to be beaten by the Houston Comets every time. In 2002, Wicks and the Liberty returned to the Finals again, but this time, they lost to Lisa Leslie and the Los Angeles Sparks. After being defeated in the 2002 Finals, Wicks would not play in the WNBA again, as she announced her retirement on April 29, 2003. Her final WNBA game was Game 2 of the 2002 Finals on August 31, 2002. The Liberty lost the championship game to the Sparks 66 - 69 with Wicks recording 2 points, 4 rebounds and 1 steal.

In 182 WNBA games played, Wicks scored 823 points, for a total of 4.5 points per game, had 182 assists for one assist per game, recovered 788 rebounds, for a total of 4.3 per game, and had 158 blocks, for a total of 0.90 blocks per game. She finished her WNBA career as the number eight leader of all times in shots blocked.

==Personal life==
Wicks was one of the few players willing to discuss sexual orientation in the WNBA during her career. She said, &quot;I can&#x27;t say how many players are gay ... but it would be easier to count the straight ones.&quot; She also said she found it &quot;annoying&quot; that the league almost exclusively promoted those who were mothers. &quot;I like it when they give insight into athletes, and I think it&#x27;s great when they say, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a player and her husband and baby.&#x27; But I&#x27;d love to see a couple of women profiled, too, especially if they had a great, solid relationship, just to show that in a positive light.&quot;

In 2002, she came out as gay, making her the first openly gay person playing in the WNBA.

==Coaching career==
Since retiring from professional basketball, Wicks formed an all-girls basketball camp in New York City. In 2004, she completed her bachelor&#x27;s degree at Rutgers and was hired as the Coordinator of Operations for the Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball team. In 2005, she was named an assistant coach of the team.

Wicks was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Basketball Category with the Class of 1991. She was inducted into the Rutgers Basketball Hall of Fame in 1994 and was inducted into the university&#x27;s Hall of Distinguished Alumni in 2005. She is one of only two Rutgers women&#x27;s basketball players to have her jersey retired.

In July 2006, she became the Assistant Coach for the women&#x27;s basketball team at Saint Francis College in Brooklyn, New York. After leaving her assistant coaching position at Saint Francis College, Wicks said that she felt that being an out lesbian was an overwhelming liability in getting a job as a women&#x27;s basketball coach.

==Hall of Fame==

Wicks was inducted in the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in June 2013. She did not have a prepared speech, but spoke extemporaneously, thanking Pat Summitt for her leadership in the formation of the Hall of Fame. Her credentials included selection as a Kodak All-American three times, and the record-holder of career points and rebounds at Rutgers, records which had not been surpassed by any male or female players at Rutgers at the time of the induction. She also played professionally in the WNBA and was on the gold medal-winning USA Basketball Pan-American Games team in 1987.

<text>Abhimanyu (, ) is a warrior in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. He was a young and valiant warrior of the Kuru lineage, born to Arjuna—the third Pandava brother—and Subhadra—the sister of the deities Krishna and Balarama. He was also one of the few individuals, along with his father, who knew the technique to enter the Chakravyuha, a powerful military formation. Abhimanyu was raised by his maternal family in Dvārakā because the Pandavas had been exiled for thirteen years by their cousins, the Kauravas. After his father&#x27;s return, his marriage was arranged with Uttarā, the princess of the Matsya Kingdom.

Abhimanyu played a significant role on the Pandava side during the Kurukshetra War. The Kaurava soldiers banded together on the thirteenth day of the battle to build the Chakravyuha in an effort to defeat the Pandavas. With Arjuna diverted to another part of the battlefield, Abhimanyū was the only one who was able to burst through the formation and take on the Kaurava soldiers. At that point, seven maharathis (powerful warriors)— Karna, Duryodhan, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Dushasan, Jayadratha and Shakuni, launched simultaneous attacks on him while violating several kshatriya codes, and he was unfairly killed at the age of sixteen. His death remains one of the most tragic events in the epic.

Abhimanyū&#x27;s posthumous son Parikshit saved the Kuru lineage from extinction, and became a well known monarch celebrated both in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;.

==Literary background==
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, a Sanskrit epic from the Indian subcontinent, tells the tale of Abhimanyu. He is related to the epic&#x27;s hero Arjuna, who was his father, and Krishna, his maternal uncle who is also a key figure in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The text, which has undergone numerous modifications, edits, and interpolations over many years, is written in classical Sanskrit. The oldest passages in the text that has survived date back to perhaps around 400 BCE. Scholars have attempted to construct a critical edition, relying mostly on a study of the &quot;Bombay&quot; edition, the &quot;Poona&quot; edition, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; edition and the &quot;south Indian&quot; editions of the manuscripts. The most accepted version is one prepared by scholars led by Vishnu Sukthankar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, preserved at Kyoto University, Cambridge University and various Indian universities.

The fight between the five Pandavas, and the one hundred Kauravas is at the heart of the narrative of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The epic&#x27;s main focus is on their great conflict, known as the Kurukshetra War. The majority of the text describes the various battles between the warriors of two sides during the war. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; is divided into eighteen &quot;parva&quot; or &#x27;books&#x27;. Like many other major characters, Abhimanyu is also introduced in the &quot;Adi Parva—&quot;the first of the 18 parvas. The seventh book&#x27;s &quot;Abhimanyu-badha Parva&quot; focuses on Abhimanyu, who is lauded throughout, and has a thorough account of how he died.

==Legends==
===Birth and early life===
The &quot;Sambhava Parva&quot; of the &quot;Adi Parva&quot; narrates the reason behind Abhimanyu&#x27;s birth and his early demise. It was once proposed at a meeting of the gods that Varchas, the son of the lunar god Soma, take on the earthly form of Abhimanyu and aid in the annihilation of evil men. Soma, who was unwilling to give up his son, accepted to their proposal only on the condition that Varchas would come back to him once he (as Abhimanyu) became sixteen.

Abhimanyu was born to Arjuna—the third of the Pandava brothers—and his wife Subhadra, who belonged to the Yadava clan. Arjuna first instructed him in military education before the Pandavas were coerced into giving up their kingdom and banished for thirteen years by their cousin Duryodhana. During this time, Subhadra remained in the kingdom of Dvaraka, the home of her brother, and raised Abhimanyu there with the help of her family. Abhimanyu received military instruction from his uncles Balarama and Krishna as well as his maternal cousin Pradyumna. When the Pandavas returned from exile, Duryodhana refused to give them their kingdom back, which ultimately sparked the Kurukshetra War.

Arjuna taught Abhimanyu the strategy for breaking into chakravyuha, a formidable military structure that resembled a labyrinth of several defensive walls. Abhimanyu was one of the four warriors who knew this skill, according to Yudhishthira. A later folklore adds that Abhimanyu learned this information from Arjuna while still inside his mother&#x27;s womb. However, he was unable to hear how to exit the chakravyuha, and this incomplete knowledge later contributed to his demise.

===Marriage===

Abhimanyu&#x27;s marriage is narrated in the &quot;Virata Parva&quot;, the fourth book of the epic. The Pandavas had to live secretly and avoid being discovered during the final year of their exile. The Pandavas stayed in the kingdom of Matsya in disguise and served its ruler Virata. The king&#x27;s daughter, Uttarā, was taught dancing and music by Arjuna, who pretended to be a eunuch named Brihannala. When their year of disguise came to an end and the Pandavas&#x27; true identities were revealed, Virata asked Arjuna to marry Uttarā. However, Arjuna declined because he had served as her teacher during that time. Instead, he put forward the idea of Uttara and Abhimanyu being married. The marriage ceremony was held in the city of Upaplavya. Abhimanyu had gotten his wife pregnant before his death, and she later gave birth to a son, Parikshit. Following the Pandavas&#x27; victory in the Kurukshetra War, Parikshit becomes the heir-apparent of Yudhishthira and later takes Yudhisthira&#x27;s place as ruler of Hastinapura.

===The Kurukshetra War===
Abhimanyu sided with the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. Even though he was a young man, he exhibited amazing bravery in the conflict. In the fifth book of the epic, &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot;, Abhimanyu was categorised as a &quot;Atirathi&quot; (&#x27;leader of leaders of car-divisions&#x27;) by Bhishma, the Kuru gransire who oversaw the Kaurava side during the first eleven days of the conflict.

The &quot;Bhishma Parva&quot; contains a thorough account of the battles fought during the first eleven days of the war, when Bhishma served as the Kaurava side&#x27;s commander. Abhimanyu first engaged in combat with Brihatbala, the king of Kosala, on the first day. Later, during a terrible battle with Bhishma, Abhimanyu broke Bhishma&#x27;s flagstaff. He engaged in combat alongside Lakshmana, son of Duryodhana, on the second day. He then occupied a position in the semi-circular phalanx Arjuna had built, known as the Ardha Chandra Vyuha. He also fought the Gandharas ferociously and when he invaded Shalya, the Magadha king Jayatsena and his elephant were slaughtered. After assisting Bhima in battle, Abhimanyu went on to defeat Lakshmana once more. Additionally, Vikarna, Chitrasena, and other Kaurava brothers were vanquished by Abhimanyu. Later, he assumed his place in the Shringataka Vyuha built by Dhrishtadyumna, the commander of the Pandava side. Abhimanyu also defeated Ambashtha and Alambusha. He then engaged in combat with Sudishna, Duryodhana, and Brihatbala.

===Death===

Abhimanyu&#x27;s death is described in detail in the &quot;Abhimanyu-vadha Parva&quot; of the &quot;Drona Parva&quot;, the eighth book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.
After Bhishma was defeated on the eleventh day, Drona—who had formerly been both the Pandavas&#x27; and the Kauravas&#x27; teacher—was named the new leader of the Kaurava side. After a lacklustre performance on the twelfth day, Duryodhana reprimanded him and reminded him of his vow to vanquish the Pandavas. Drona made the decision to start the chakravyuha after feeling embarrassed. As Arjuna was skilled in chakravyuha defence, he requested Duryodhana to divert Arjuna. On the thirteenth day, Arjuna was detoured to the south by Samsaptakas. The army of Kauravas, led by Dronacharya, then arranged themselves in the array of Chakravyuha. The &quot;maharathis&quot; such as Drona, Karna, Shalya, Kripa, Ashvatthama, Duryodhana, Jayadratha, Duhshasana and Bhurishrava formed the wheel formation, guarded by millions of soldiers. The Pandava forces advanced to engage in combat, but all were forced back by Drona&#x27;s lethal arrows. As one of the few people who was capable of entering the chakravyuha, Abhimanyu was given the task by Yudhisthira. Abhimanyu reminded Yudhishthira that he didn&#x27;t know the escape from the formation, but Yudhishthira persuaded him that their warriors were following him to help in case of fatal danger.

Abhimanyu then commanded his charioteer, Sumitra, to head for Drona, while Pandavas trailed behind him. The Kaurava soldiers attacked Abhimanyu, but he cut through their formidable defence and tore it apart. Then formidable Kaurava warriors challenged him. In separate battles, Abhimanyu defeated Duryodhana, Dushashana, Drona, Ashvathama, Karna, Shakuni. He also slew numerous enemy warriors, including the son of King Asmaka, the brothers of Shalya, Rukmaratha, Lakshmana, Vrindaka, Brihatbala, Asvaketu, and the Bhoja prince Martikavata. Duryodhana, outraged at his son&#x27;s murder, instructed Drona to alter the original plan to assassinate Abhimanyu. The Pandavas forces were stopped by Jayadratha, who ultimately vanquished all four of them, leaving Abhimanyu all by himself. Shakuni, Duryodhana&#x27;s infamous uncle, devised a strategy to attack him simultaneously that violated the rules of war. Abhimanyu was immediately assailed by the seven maharathis— Jayadratha, Duryodhan, Dushasan, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Karna and Shakuni. They demolished his chariot, murdered the horses of his chariot, broke his weapons, and shot him with numerous arrows. Abhimanyu continued to fight using a chariot wheel even though he was exhausted and hopeless at this point, killing numerous Gandhara soldiers. A blow to the head from Dushashana&#x27;s son ultimately caused him to succumb to his wounds and he died a hero.

==In derivative works==
===Sasirekha Parinayam===

While the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions Uttarā as Abhimanyu&#x27;s only wife, the Telugu folktale &quot;Sasirekha Parinayam&quot; adds the story of Abhimanyu marrying Sashirekha (also known as Vatsala), the daughter of his uncle Balarama, before marrying Uttarā. According to the story, Abhimanyu fell in love with Sasirekha while staying in Dvaraka, but Revathi wanted her to marry Lakshmana, Duryodhana&#x27;s son. Ghatotkacha, Bhima&#x27;s son who wanted to help his cousin, disguised himself as Sashirekha and broke Lakshmana&#x27;s arm. As a result of the incident, Lakshmana ended his marriage to Sashirekha. The real Sashirekha and Abhimanyu were married in the forest at the time. No such has been attested in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

===Wayang===
In Indonesia, in Javanese wayang culture, Abhimanyu (Indonesian: &quot;Abimanyu&quot;) is an important figure. His figure in Indonesian - Javanese culture, has developed and is different from the version in India.

In the wayang, Abimanyu is told as a character who is gentle, well-behaved, honest, firm-hearted, responsible, and brave. He is also known as Angkawijaya, Jaya Murcita, Jaka Pengalasan, Partasuta, Kirityatmaja, Sumbadraatmaja, Wanudara and Wirabatana. In this version of story, he has 13 other siblings, possesses two divine revelations — &quot;Hidayat&quot;, which can make him understand everything, and &quot;Makutha Raja&quot;, gained because of his solemn asceticism. He is taught military by his father (Arjuna) directly, while he got mysticism from his grandfather, Bagawan Abiyasa. Abimanyu lived in the Palangkawati knighthood after defeating Prabu Jayamurcita. His wives are Dewi Siti Sundari, daughter of Prabu Kresna, king of the Dwarawati state with Dewi Pratiwi. The story of Abimanyu&#x27;s marriage to Siti Sundari was performed in a leather puppet show with the title Alap-Alapan Siti Sundari or Jaya Murcita Ngraman. Dewi Utari, daughter of King Matsyapati and Dewi Ni Yutisnawati, from the country of Wirata, and the son of Parikesit. The story of Abimanyu&#x27;s marriage to Utari was performed in a wayang kulit stage with the title Putu Rabi Nini or Kalabendana Gugur.

Abimanyu died in Baratayuda, the battle between the Kauravas against the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra field. At that time, only three knights from the Pandavas were on the battlefield and mastered the war strategy, namely Bhima, Arjuna, and Abimanyu. Ghatotkacha left because Karna stretched out Kunta Wijayadanu&#x27;s weapon. Other knights lured Bima and Arjuna from the Kauravas to get out of the battlefield, so Abimanyu was the only one that the Pandavas relied on at that time.

After all his brothers died, Abimanyu forgot to set up the battle formation. He advanced alone into the middle of the Kauravas line and was trapped in the deadly formation his enemy had set up. The Kauravas rained weapons on Abimanyu&#x27;s body until Abimanyu fell and fell from his horse—in the wayang, the wounds of charcoal from the basket are depicted (a lot of them). Abimanyu looks like a hedgehog because of the various weapons stuck in his body. According to the story, the incident was a risk of taking an oath when proposing to Dewi Utari. Abimanyu once swore that he was still single and stated that if he took a perjury oath, he was ready to die being beaten and impaled by various weapons of his enemies. Abimanyu took a perjury oath because, at that time, he had already married Dewi Siti Sundari.

With various weapons stuck all over his body, Abimanyu could no longer walk. However, Abimanyu did not give up. He even managed to kill the future crown prince of Astina, namely Lesmana Mandrakumara, son of Prabu Duryodana, by throwing the Pulanggeni kris after penetrating the bodies of four other soldiers. At that time, the Kauravas knew that killing Abimanyu required cutting off the langsang in his chest. In the end, Abimanyu was killed by the mace of Kyai Glinggang or Galih Asem belonging to Jayadrata, a knight from Banakeling.

==In popular culture==
In 1974, a base named INS Abhimanyu was established symbolizing the character of Abhimanyu. On 1 May 1980, the Premier Chariot Base in Mumbai was commissioned as the permanent base for the unit. The Indian Maritime Special Forces (IMSF) is based with INS Abhimanyu.

In media adaptations, Abhimanyu has been portrayed by actors such as Ashok Kumar in &quot;Uttara Abhimanyu (1946 film)&quot;, S. M. Kumaresan in Tamil &quot;Abhimanyu (1948 film)&quot;, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Gemini Ganesan in the Telugu and Tamil film version of the film &quot;Mayabazar&quot; (1957) respectively, Nandamuri Balakrishna in the Telugu Film Daana Veera Soora Karna (1977), Mayur Verma in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Mahabharat (1988 TV series)&quot;, Anuj Sharma in &quot;Krishna (TV series)&quot;, Paras Arora in Star plus&#x27;s &quot;Mahabharat (2013 TV series)&quot;, Meghan Jadhav in SET&#x27;s series &quot;Suryaputra Karna&quot;, and Nikhil Kumar in Kannada movie &quot;Kurukshetra (2019)&quot;.

<doc id="693612" wikidata="Q6688842" url="?curid=693612" title="Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall">
<text>Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall is the concert hall component of the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The 2,743-seat hall was completed in 1980 at a cost of US$28 million to give the San Francisco Symphony a permanent home.

Previously, the symphony shared the neighboring War Memorial Opera House with the San Francisco Opera and San Francisco Ballet. The construction of Davies Hall allowed the symphony to expand to a full-time, year-round schedule.

==Acoustics==

Designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and Pietro Belluschi along with acoustical consultants Bolt, Beranek and Newman, its modern design is visually elegant both inside and out. A &quot;cloud&quot; of movable convex acrylic reflecting panels over the stage enables the acoustic space to be adjusted to suit the size of the orchestra and audience, while adjustable fabric banners around the auditorium can alter the reverberation time from approximately one to two-and-one-half seconds.

Architects created acoustic isolation of the performance space by constructing a building within a building. The outer building uses one inch thick structural glass as a curtain wall, with the next structural wall forming the back wall of the lobby spaces. Passing through a door leads to a hallway, bounded on one side by the lobby wall and on the other by the structural wall of the inner building. This continuous hallway acts as an acoustical isolator and is surfaced with sound absorbing material.

However, the hall&#x27;s large volume and seating capacity initially resulted in less than ideal results. Kirkegaard Associates completed acoustical renovations in 1992 at a cost of $10 million which resulted in substantial improvement.

The modifications included: narrowing and shaping the walls above the stage to reduce the volume of space and increase useful reflections, replacing the cloud of reflector discs with a more effective array of curved rectangular panels covering a larger area and now computer adjustable, moving the walls of the floor-level seating inward to make the audience area narrower and more rectangular, adding aisles to replace the former continental seating, adding diffusing elements in various parts of the hall, and increasing the &quot;rake&quot; of the floor seating to provide better sightlines. In addition, the firm installed risers on the stage allowing musicians to both see and hear each other better. These and other improvements enhanced not only the acoustics but also the hall&#x27;s beauty.

==Fratelli Ruffatti concert organ==
The Fratelli Ruffatti electro-pneumatic pipe organ with 147 ranks was added in 1984. It is designed to accommodate repertory from the pre-baroque to the present. The console can be electronically reprogrammed to correspond to the two major schools of organ keyboard organization, the German and the French. The console is mobile and can be placed where appropriate to the program or stored off-stage when not in use.

==Amenities==
In addition to the concert hall itself, an adjoining building contains the Harold L. Zellerbach Rehearsal Hall, comprising three separate rehearsal spaces. The largest of these was designed to be the same size as the stage of the Opera House across the street to accommodate Opera and Ballet rehearsals. Davies Hall also contains offices for symphony staff, a music library, dressing rooms, a recreation room and lockers for Symphony musicians, and the Wattis Room, a private dining room for major donors. A proposed recital hall was never built; that portion of the site remains empty, and is used for employee parking.

A Henry Moore bronze sculpture, &quot;Large Four Piece Reclining Figure 1972–73&quot; (1973), is displayed outside the hall at the corner of Grove Street and Van Ness Avenue.

Davies Hall also occasionally hosts non-orchestral performances by contemporary musicians.

==Reviews==
In 1980, Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the hall &quot;a building utterly confused about style, a poor hybrid that has neither the verve of one aspect of the city&#x27;s identity nor the powerful tradition of another.&quot;

<doc id="693613" wikidata="Q705750" url="?curid=693613" title="Shisa">
<text>is a traditional Ryukyuan cultural artifact and decoration derived from Chinese guardian lions, often seen in similar pairs, resembling a cross between a lion and a dog, from Okinawan mythology. Shisa are wards, believed to protect from some evils. People place pairs of shisa on their rooftops or flanking the gates to their houses, with the left shisa traditionally having a closed mouth, the right one an open mouth. The open mouth shisa traditionally wards off evil spirits, and the closed mouth shisa keeps good spirits in.

==History==

Like the &quot;komainu&quot; (&quot;lion dogs&quot;), the shisa are a variation of the guardian lions from China. From the Edo period, they started to be called &quot;guardian dogs&quot; in general in mainland Japan. Gender is variously assigned to the shisa. Some Okinawans believe the male has his mouth closed to keep bad out of the home, while the female has her mouth open to share goodness. Others believe the female has her mouth closed to &quot;keep in the good&quot;, while the male has his mouth open to &quot;scare away the bad&quot; (Compare this to the distinction between male and female guardian lions in Chinese culture).

==Legend==
When a Chinese emissary returned from a voyage to the court at Shuri Castle, he brought a gift for the king, a necklace decorated with a figurine of a shisa. The king found it charming and wore it underneath his clothes. At the Naha Port bay, the village of Madanbashi was often terrorized by a sea dragon who ate the villagers and destroyed their property. One day, the king was visiting the village, and one of these attacks happened; all the people ran and hid. The local &quot;noro&quot; had been told in a dream to instruct the king when he visited to stand on the beach and lift up his figurine towards the dragon; she sent the boy, Chiga, to tell him the message. He faced the monster with the figurine held high, and immediately a giant roar sounded all through the village, a roar so deep and powerful that it even shook the dragon. A massive boulder then fell from heaven and crushed the dragon&#x27;s tail, so that he couldn&#x27;t move, and eventually died. This boulder and the dragon&#x27;s body became covered with plants and surrounded by trees, and can still be seen today as the &quot;Gana-mui Woods&quot; near Naha Ohashi bridge. The townspeople then built a large stone &quot;shisa&quot; to protect it from the dragon&#x27;s spirit and other threats.

==Great Stone Shisa at Tomimori==
At Tomimori Village near Kochinda Town in the far southern part of Okinawa, there were often many fires. The people of the area sought out Saiouzui, a Feng Shui master, to ask him why there were so many fires. He believed they were because of the power of the nearby Mt. Yaese, and suggested that the townspeople build a stone shisa to face the mountain. They did so, and thus have protected their village from fire ever since.

<text>Quercus frainetto (synonyms &quot;Quercus conferta&quot;, &quot;Quercus farnetto&quot;), commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a species of oak, native to southeastern Europe (parts of Italy, the Balkans, parts of Hungary, Romania) and Turkey. It is classified in &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Quercus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Quercus frainetto&quot; is a large deciduous tree, reaching heights of tall by broad, with a trunk girth of nearly . The bark is light gray in colour and cracks into small square cracking plates. The buds are large, long and pointed, shiny russet or light brown in colour with minute tomentum. The twigs are stout and covered with russet upward pointed hairs.

The leaves are large, long, occasionally up to , variable in shape, divided into 6–10 very deep parallel lobes which are usually divided into sublobes. The leaf stalks are usually short, , rarely to 22 mm, long. The leaves are widest close to the apex, which is broad and short pointed. The base of the leaf usually has auricles which sometimes overlap the twig. The light yellow green expanding leaves turn rich dark green by the beginning of summer. The leaves are covered with minute russet hairs, especially the lower surface. The leaves are concentrated at the ends of twigs. The leaves turn brown, russet or yellow in fall and sometimes remain attached to the twigs until the following spring.

The light brown acorns mature in about 6 months. They are long, egg shaped, usually with a blunt apex. The acorn cup is covered with long overlapping scales and russet hairs. The acorns tend to concentrate in groups of two to eight at the ends of twigs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The centre of the tree&#x27;s native range is in the Balkans. It is adapted to the subcontinental climate of southeastern Europe, but the main factor of its occurrence at a particular site is the soil. It is specially adapted to heavy acidic soils (cambisols and vertisols), typical of Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania. These soils are usually leached out, very dry in the summer and sometimes waterlogged in the spring. However, the Hungarian oak does not tolerate flooding or high water tables. It is also extremely sensitive to the presence of lime in the soil. Hence, in contradiction to its English vernacular name, which was assigned when the Kingdom of Hungary controlled large parts of the Balkans, the Hungarian oak is a very rare tree in modern Hungary, where the soils are generally very rich in lime. The Hungarian oak-Turkey oak forest (&quot;Quercetum frainetto-cerris&quot; Rud.) is the most widespread association of this oak in the Balkans, which is also the most common forest type in Serbia and Kosovo.

==Cultivation==
This tree is cultivated in parks and large gardens, and the cultivar &#x27;Hungarian Crown&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="693615" wikidata="Q33850" url="?curid=693615" title="Norman language">
<text>Norman or Norman French (, , Guernésiais: , Jèrriais: ) is a &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;. The name &quot;Norman French&quot; is sometimes also used to describe the administrative languages of &quot;Anglo-Norman&quot; and &quot;Law French&quot; used in England. For the most part, the written forms of Norman and modern French are mutually intelligible. The thirteenth-century philosopher Roger Bacon was the first to distinguish it along with other dialects such as Picard and Bourguignon. Today, although it does not enjoy any official status, some reports of the French Ministry of Culture have recognized it as one of the regional languages of France.

==History==
When Norse Vikings from modern day Scandinavia arrived in Neustria, in the western part of the then Kingdom of the Franks, and settled the land that became known as Normandy, these North-Germanic–speaking people came to live among a local Gallo-Romance–speaking population. In time, the communities converged, so that &quot;Normandy&quot; continued to form the name of the region while the original Norsemen were largely assimilated by the Gallo-Romance people, adopting their speech but still contributing some elements from Old Norse language and Norse culture. Later, when conquering England, the Norman rulers in England would eventually assimilate, thereby adopting the speech of the local English. In both cases, the elites contributed elements of their own language to the newly enriched languages that developed in the territories.

In Normandy, the Norman language inherited only some 150 words from Old Norse. The influence on phonology is disputed, although it is argued that the retention of aspirated and in Norman is due to Norse influence.

==Geographical distribution==

Norman is spoken in mainland Normandy in France, where it has no official status, but is classed as a regional language. It is taught in a few colleges near Cherbourg-Octeville.

In the Channel Islands, the Norman language has developed separately, but not in isolation, to form:

* Jèrriais (in Jersey)
* Guernésiais or Dgèrnésiais or Guernsey French (in Guernsey)
* Sercquiais (or Sarkese, in Sark) 
* Auregnais (in Alderney)

The British and Irish governments recognize Jèrriais and Guernésiais as regional languages within the framework of the British–Irish Council. Sercquiais is in fact a descendant of the 16th-century Jèrriais used by the original colonists from Jersey who settled the then uninhabited island.

The last first-language speakers of Auregnais, the dialect of Norman spoken on Alderney, died during the 20th century, although some rememberers are still alive. The dialect of Herm also lapsed at an unknown date; the patois spoken there was likely Guernésiais (Herm was not inhabited all year round in the Norman culture&#x27;s heyday).

An isogloss termed the &quot;Joret line&quot; (&quot;ligne Joret&quot;) separates the northern and southern dialects of the Norman language (the line runs from Granville, Manche to the French-speaking Belgian border in the province of Hainaut and Thiérache). Dialectal differences also distinguish western and eastern dialects.

Three different standardized spellings are used: continental Norman, Jèrriais, and Dgèrnésiais. These represent the different developments and particular literary histories of the varieties of Norman. Norman may therefore be described as a pluricentric language.

The Anglo-Norman dialect of Norman served as a language of administration in England following the Norman conquest of England in 1066. This left a legacy of Law French in the language of English courts (though it was also influenced by Parisian French). In Ireland, Norman remained strongest in the area of south-east Ireland, where the Hiberno-Normans invaded in 1169. Norman remains in (limited) use for some very formal legal purposes in the UK, such as when the monarch gives royal assent to an Act of Parliament using the phrase, &quot;Le Roy (la Reyne) le veult&quot; (&quot;The King (the Queen) wills it&quot;).

The Norman conquest of southern Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries brought the language to Sicily and the southern part of the Italian Peninsula, where it may have left a few words in the Sicilian language. &quot;See: Norman and French influence on Sicilian.&quot;

Literature in Norman ranges from early Anglo-Norman literature through the 19th-century Norman literary renaissance to modern writers (&quot;see&quot; list of Norman-language writers).

, the Norman language remains strongest in the less accessible areas of the former Duchy of Normandy: the Channel Islands and the Cotentin Peninsula (Cotentinais) in the west, and the Pays de Caux (Cauchois dialect) in the east. Ease of access from Paris and the popularity of the coastal resorts of central Normandy, such as Deauville, in the 19th century led to a significant loss of distinctive Norman culture in the central low-lying areas of Normandy.

===Old French influences===
Norman French preserves a number of Old French words which have been lost in Modern French. Examples of Norman French words of Old French origin:
Examples of Norman French words with -ei instead of -oi in Standard French words 
Examples of Norman French words with &quot;c-&quot; / &quot;qu-&quot; and &quot;g-&quot; instead of &quot;ch-&quot; and &quot;j&quot; in Standard French
===Norse influences===

Examples of Norman words of Norse origin:
In some cases, Norse words adopted in Norman have been borrowed into French – and more recently some of the English words used in French can be traced back to Norman origins.

===Influence of Norman on English language=== 

Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the Norman and other languages and dialects spoken by the new rulers of England were used during several hundred years, developing into the unique insular dialect now known as Anglo-Norman French, and leaving traces of specifically Norman words that can be distinguished from the equivalent lexical items in French:

Other borrowings, such as &quot;canvas&quot;, &quot;captain&quot;, &quot;cattle&quot; and &quot;kennel&quot;, exemplify how Norman retained Latin /k/ that was not retained in French.

In the United Kingdom, Acts of Parliament are confirmed with the words &quot;Le Roy le veult&quot; (&quot;The King wishes it&quot;) and other Norman phrases are used on formal occasions as legislation progresses.

===Norman immigration in Canada===

Norman immigrants to North America also introduced some &quot;Normanisms&quot; to Quebec French and the French language in Canada generally. Joual, a working class sociolect of Quebec, in particular exhibits a Norman influence. For example the word &quot;placoter&quot; can mean both to splash around or to chatter comes from the Normand French word &quot;clapoter&quot; which means the same thing.

<text>Quercus laurifolia (swamp laurel oak, diamond-leaf oak, water oak, obtusa oak, laurel oak) is a medium-sized semi-evergreen oak in the red oak section &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;. It is native to the southeastern and south-central United States.

== Description ==
&quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot; is a tree growing to (rarely to ) tall, with a large, circular crown. The leaves are broad lanceolate, long and broad, and unlobed (very rarely three-lobed) with an entire margin and a bristle tip; they typically fall just as the new leaves start to emerge in spring. The acorns, borne in a shallow or deep cup, are hemispherical or oblong, but up to long, green, maturing blackish-brown about 18 months after pollination. Acorn production is often heavy, enhancing the species&#x27; value for wildlife. The seedlings show embryo dormancy and germinate the following spring after fall ripening; germination is hypogeal.
Swamp laurel oak grows rapidly and usually matures in about 50 years.

A similar evergreen oak that also grows in sandy soils is &quot;Quercus hemisphaerica&quot;, the sand laurel oak.

== Taxonomy ==
The botanist C.J. Burke suggested that swamp laurel oak is of hybrid origin having been derived from willow oak (&quot;Quercus phellos&quot;) and water oak (&quot;Quercus nigra&quot;); it is not found outside the ranges of the two supposed parental species. This conclusion was based on an index from leaf-shape on seedlings grown from acorns. However, this theory has not achieved wide support, with current authors accepting &quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot; as a distinct species (e.g. Flora of North America).

==Distribution and habitat==
Swamp laurel oak grows from coastal Virginia to central Florida and west to southeast Texas. There are reports of the species growing in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but these probably represent introductions.

The species is found mostly on alluvial flood plains, from sea level up to altitude. It will tolerate the wetter sites in association with other oak species but will not live with continuous or prolonged flooding. It is most often found growing in sandy soil near rivers and along the edges of swamps if not too frequently flooded. Swamp laurel oak grows in the hammocks of central Florida and on sand hills adjacent to swamps in west Florida. Swamp laurel oak grows best on ultisols and inceptisols.

The range has average annual temperatures from . It can withstand extreme lows ranging from . Extreme highs range from .

It needs between of rainfall a year. From of this is received during the growing season from April to September.

The laurel oak is probably one of the most cold-hardy evergreen oaks. Trees growing in Cincinnati indicate the laurel oak may be hardy even further north than previously thought tolerating temperatures lower than and surviving into zone 5. In Cincinnati trees have been observed staying green well into December.

== Ecology ==
Known hybrids with &quot;Quercus laurifolia&quot; as one parent are with &quot;Q. falcata&quot; (&quot;Q × beaumontiana&quot; Sarg.), &quot;Q. incana&quot; (&quot;Q. × atlantica&quot; Ashe), and &quot;Q. marilandica&quot; (&quot;Q. × diversiloba&quot; Tharp ex A. Camus).

The tree is host to the general oak-feeding insects but has no serious insect problems. Several species of &quot;Curculio&quot; weevils infest the acorns.

Despite their bitter kernel, the acorns are eaten by deer (including white-tailed deer), squirrels, birds (including ducks, bobwhite quail and wild turkeys), raccoons and small rodents.

== Uses ==
It is grown and marketed mainly as pulpwood. It is commonly used as an ornamental tree in landscaping because of its fast growth and pleasing appearance; it is planted with little regard to soil type.

<text>Twilo was an American nightclub in operation from 1995 to 2001 in New York City, and from 2006 to 2007 in Miami.

== Closing ==

Twilo had been under pressure to close from then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani ever since the launch of his controversial quality-of-life campaign. Still, the club managed to hold onto its cabaret license until early 2001, when a spate of previous allegations re-surfaced in connection with a claim by city authorities that the club had misused private ambulances to hide victims of drug overdoses. Club management claimed that the ambulance was obtained by recommendation of the city.

The space on West 27th Street was reused as various other nightclubs over the following years, including Spirit and B.E.D., the latter of which shuttered in 2007 shortly after an incident where manager Granville Adams pushed Orlando Valle to his death down the elevator shaft. In 2011, the space was bought by immersive theater company Emursive as the home of &quot;Sleep No More&quot; in a venue called the McKittrick Hotel.

<doc id="693623" wikidata="Q3239165" url="?curid=693623" title="Galactic plane">
<text>The galactic plane is the plane on which the majority of a disk-shaped galaxy&#x27;s mass lies. The directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the galactic poles. In actual usage, the terms &quot;galactic plane&quot; and &quot;galactic poles&quot; usually refer specifically to the plane and poles of the Milky Way, in which Planet Earth is located.

Some galaxies are irregular and do not have any well-defined disk. Even in the case of a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, defining the galactic plane is slightly imprecise and arbitrary since the stars are not perfectly coplanar. In 1959, the IAU defined the position of the Milky Way&#x27;s north galactic pole as exactly RA = , Dec = in the then-used B1950 epoch; in the currently-used J2000 epoch, after precession is taken into account, its position is RA , Dec . This position is in Coma Berenices, near the bright star Arcturus; likewise, the south galactic pole lies in the constellation Sculptor.

The &quot;zero of longitude&quot; of galactic coordinates was also defined in 1959 to be at position angle 123° from the north celestial pole. Thus the zero longitude point on the galactic equator was at , (B1950) or , (J2000), and its J2000 position angle is 122.932°. The Galactic Center is located at position angle 31.72° (B1950) or 31.40° (J2000) east of north.

<text>Maurice Anthony Coneys Gorham (1902 – 9 August 1975) was an Irish journalist and broadcasting executive. After being educated in England at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire and later Balliol College, Oxford, he began working as a journalist on the London local newspaper &quot;Westminster Guardian and Weekly Westminster&quot; after he graduated in 1923.

==Career==

Gorham worked in the London newspaper industry for three years, before in 1926 joining the staff of the BBC&#x27;s own listings magazine, the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. In 1928 he was promoted to become the magazine&#x27;s Art Editor, and then in 1933 became its general Editor, a post he was to occupy for eight years until 1941.

In that year, he made the switch from broadcasting journalism to working in broadcasting proper when he was appointed as the Director of the BBC&#x27;s North American Services. He returned to Europe in 1944 to serve as Director of the BBC Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme - a radio service specially designed for the allied troops invading Europe after D-Day. In that capacity, he worked closely with Major Glenn Miller and his Army Air Force Band.

After the end of the war in 1945, he was appointed as the Director of the new BBC Light Programme; this appointment was only a brief one, however, for in the following year he was made the first post-war Director of the re-launched BBC Television Service, responsible for getting the young service back up and running after a seven-year break. However, disagreements with his superiors meant that this was also a brief appointment, and he resigned from the staff of the BBC after twenty-one years in 1947, returning to journalism.

He went back home to Ireland, and in 1953 returned to broadcasting as the Director of Radio Éireann. In September 1959 he left this position - his reasons for resigning were not disclosed, but it is widely believed that he disagreed strongly with the Government&#x27;s plans for how to introduce a television service to the country, which was due to happen the following year.

In his retirement he wrote a number of books on broadcasting, pubs and Ireland and Irish life. He died in Dublin on 9 August 1975.

<doc id="693629" wikidata="Q607212" url="?curid=693629" title="Studio 54">
<text>Studio 54 is a Broadway theater and former nightclub at 254 West 54th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Opened as the Gallo Opera House in 1927, it served as a CBS broadcast studio in the mid-20th century. Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager opened the Studio 54 nightclub, retaining much of the former theatrical and broadcasting fixtures, inside the venue in 1977. Roundabout Theatre Company renovated the space into a Broadway house in 1998.

The producer Fortune Gallo announced plans for an opera house in 1926, hiring Eugene De Rosa as the architect. The Gallo Opera House opened November 8, 1927, but soon went bankrupt and was renamed the New Yorker Theatre. The space also operated as the Casino de Paree nightclub, then the Palladium Music Hall, before the Federal Music Project staged productions at the theater for three years starting in 1937. CBS began using the venue as a soundstage in 1942, then as a television studio until 1975.

Schrager and Rubell opened the Studio 54 nightclub on April 26, 1977, as disco was gaining popularity in the U.S. Infamous for its celebrity guest lists, quixotic entry policies, extravagant events, rampant drug use, and sexual hedonism, Studio 54 closed in 1980 after Schrager and Rubell were convicted of tax evasion. A scaled-back version of the nightclub continued under new management before becoming the Ritz rock club in 1989, then the Cabaret Royale bar in 1994.

The Roundabout Theatre Company renovated the space in 1998 to relocate its production of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which ran at Studio 54 until 2004. The modern theater has since hosted multiple productions each season. The main auditorium, with 1,006 seats on two levels, is complemented by two sister cabaret venues: Upstairs at 54 on the second floor since 2001, and 54 Below in the basement since 2012. The heyday of the 1970s club features in numerous exhibitions, films, and albums, with memorabilia from the nightclub appearing at auctions.

== Design ==
Studio 54 was originally designed by Eugene De Rosa as the Gallo Opera House, which contained 1,400 seats when it opened in 1927. De Rosa&#x27;s original plans called for lounges, restrooms, and promenades on three stories, as well as an opera museum below the primary floors. By 1933, when it was being used as the Casino de Paree nightclub, the theater had 650 seats on the orchestra level and 500 seats in the balcony. CBS documents show that, when the theater was used as CBS Studio 52 in the mid-20th century, it had 828 seats on three levels: 312 in the orchestra, 371 in the balcony, and 145 in a mezzanine. The modern-day theater has 1,006 seats across two levels: 519 in the orchestra and 487 in the balcony. The theater contained nightclub tables during the late 20th century, which were removed in 1998 after Studio 54&#x27;s re-conversion into a theater and replaced with raked seating.

Ida Louise Killam designed the original interior with a gold, blue, and rose palette. One early observer described the theater as having &quot;a Roxy foyer and a Paramount promenade&quot;. The orchestra seats were originally divided by five aisles. The orchestra-level walls were clad with walnut, and the trimmings at balcony level and in the mezzanine lounge were also made of walnut. The vaulted ceiling contained a dome measuring across, as well as indirect lighting. This dome is decorated with medallions. According to CBS documents, Studio 54&#x27;s proscenium arch measures high and wide. There was a fly system above the stage. Backstage were six dressing rooms, as well as a rehearsal space at stage left.

To avoid disrupting the construction of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Eighth Avenue Line, structural engineer David M. Oltarsh placed the Gallo Opera House&#x27;s foundation, orchestra, and balcony within an enclosure that was suspended from the theater building&#x27;s roof. The modern mezzanine-level promenade has an exhibit with information on the theater&#x27;s current production. The theater also contains a bar in its lobby, which is a tribute to the former Studio 54 nightclub.

=== 54 Below ===
The cabaret club 54 Below opened in Studio 54&#x27;s basement on June 5, 2012. It was designed by architect Richard H. Lewis, set designer John Lee Beatty, lighting designer Ken Billington, and sound designer Peter Hylenski. A staircase from ground level leads to a rectangular room with leather and wood decorations, as well as a red, purple, and brown color palette. The room contains 140 seats in a cabaret-style arrangement and 16 seats in a bar to the right. Originally, 54 Below presented shows every day of the week, with 4,000 performances in its first five years. In partnership with musician Michael Feinstein, the club was renamed Feinstein&#x27;s/54 Below in 2015; the club reverted to the name 54 Below when the partnership ended in July 2022.

===Upstairs at Studio 54===
Josh Hadar of Allied Partners created a 175-seat cabaret space on the second floor, called Upstairs at Studio 54. The space opened in February 2001 and is accessed via its own entrance at ground level. This space was used exclusively for special events. Performances occurred during nights when plays were not being staged. The musical &quot;Newsical&quot; was staged there from October 2004 to April 2005.

==Early history==

=== Gallo Opera House ===
In July 1926, theatrical impresario Fortune Gallo leased a site at 254 West 54th Street and hired Eugene De Rosa to design a 16-story office building at the site, with a 1,400-seat theater at its base. Z. D. Berry and Robert Podgur would build the venue at an estimated cost of $2 million. Gallo planned to present the San Carlo Grand Opera Company&#x27;s productions at the theater during the autumn, renting it out for legitimate shows at other times. The venue was originally supposed to open in January 1927, but this was delayed because the opera company had an extended engagement in San Francisco. Prior to the venue&#x27;s opening, Gallo transferred his interest in the San Carlo Company to his nephew Aurelio Gallo, allowing the elder Gallo to focus on operating the new theater.

The opera house opened on November 8, 1927, with the San Carlo Company&#x27;s large-scale production of &quot;La bohème&quot;. The Gallo was one of three legitimate theaters to open in New York City during 1927; at the time, the city had over 200 legitimate theaters. The San Carlo Company performed for two weeks. A revival of the play &quot;Electra&quot; opened at the Gallo that December, followed the same month by &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. A $660,000 mortgage was placed on the theater building in January 1928. The American Opera Company opened its season there the same month, performing there until March. Ballet Moderne also performed there for two weeks in April 1928.

Philip Goodman leased the theater for five years in mid-1928. Goodman used the theater to stage a production of Laurence Stallings and Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s musical &quot;Rainbow&quot;, which ran for less than a month in late 1928. In the meantime, the theater also hosted events such as dance performances, a violin recital, and a choir performance. Radiant Productions leased the theater in September 1929, with plans to present a dozen plays for three weeks each. Their first and only production, &quot;Ladies Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, was a critical failure. That October, Radiant transferred its lease to William R. Kane, who staged a short-lived revival of the comedy &quot;A Tailor-Made Man&quot; there. At a foreclosure auction in December 1929, the theater&#x27;s mortgagee Hemphill Realty Corporation bought the theater for $1,045,000.

=== New Yorker Theatre ===
Gallo sold his lease to an unidentified buyer in January 1930, as he wanted to focus on operating a radio station. Richard Herndon took over as the theater&#x27;s managing director, renaming it the New Yorker Theatre the next month. The first production at the renamed theater was the Henrik Ibsen play &quot;The Vikings&quot;, which had a short run in May 1930. The New Yorker hosted more dance recitals before the opening of its next legitimate show, &quot;Electra&quot;, in December 1930. Oliver D. Bailey signed a five-year lease for the theater in January 1931. In general, the theater suffered from low attendance during the Great Depression. Among the theater&#x27;s productions in 1931 were the plays &quot;Gray Shadow&quot;, &quot;Young Sinners&quot;, &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;, and &quot;It Never Rains&quot;; the musical &quot;Fast and Furious&quot;; and performances by the New Yorker Grand Opera Company. The next year, the theater hosted several plays performed by the Spanish-speaking theatrical company La Compania Dramatic Espanola, as well as another dance festival. The Bowery Savings Bank bought the New Yorker and the adjacent office building for $650,000 in December 1932.

The bank leased the theater to Continental Music Halls Inc. for five years in September 1933. Continental announced plans to convert the theater into a nightclub called Casino de Paree (sometimes spelled Casino de Paris), with dining areas on two stories and a kitchen in the basement. The club&#x27;s operators spent $200,000 on renovations, reopening the venue on December 12, 1933. It was one of three theaters near 54th Street that were converted to nightclubs in the mid-1930s. There were 1,150 seats on two levels. The stage was used as a dance floor, accessed by steps from the orchestra level, and was flanked by two bands. Billy Rose organized two shows a night, for which guests paid $1.50 to $2 per ticket. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the nightclub &quot;just about satisfies the gastronomic, bibulous, and entertainment needs of any mortal&quot;.

The club&#x27;s operators bought the theater and adjacent office building in March 1934. The club&#x27;s cheap revues competed with Broadway musicals with higher-priced tickets. Rose withdrew from the venture in September 1934 because of disagreements over pay. The Casino de Paree was closed for renovations in February 1935, reopening two weeks later. The Casino de Paree abruptly closed after filing for bankruptcy in April 1935. That December, the Bowery Savings Bank leased the theater to the Palladium Operating Corporation, which planned to convert it into an &quot;English&quot;-style music hall. The Palladium Music Hall opened the next month; it was to host a new show every two weeks, with two bands performing during dinnertime. The Palladium had trouble paying wages within three weeks of its opening, and it closed permanently at the beginning of February 1936.

The Works Progress Administration (WPA)&#x27;s Federal Music Project leased the theater, as well as four of the office floors, in November 1936; the venue would host operas and concerts by the WPA&#x27;s Theatre of Music. The WPA renovated the theater over the next two months, opening the Theater of Music on January 24, 1937. The WPA renewed its lease later the same year. An all-black WPA cast from Chicago presented &quot;The Swing Mikado&quot; at the New Yorker Theatre in early 1939; after two months, the production moved to the 44th Street Theatre. The play &quot;Medicine Show&quot; then premiered at the New Yorker in April 1940, closing after a month. This was the theater&#x27;s last Broadway show for nearly six decades.

== Broadcast studio ==
The Bowery Savings Bank again owned the New Yorker Theatre by late 1940, and the bank&#x27;s real-estate agent Joseph O&#x27;Gara was looking to lease the venue. That October, RCA Manufacturing signed a one-year lease for the theater, exhibiting television projectors there. RCA subsidiary NBC installed a television screen by the end of 1940. Early the following year, NBC installed a projection screen on the stage, spending $25,000 to $30,000 on the project. The first public exhibition of the theater&#x27;s screen was in May 1941, when over a thousand audience members watched a live broadcast of a boxing match between Billy Soose and Ken Overlin at Madison Square Garden. In September 1941, the Top Dollar Theatre company unsuccessfully tried to lease the venue from the Bowery Savings Bank. The New Yorker Theatre then briefly hosted the children&#x27;s play &quot;The Adventures of Marco Polo&quot; at the end of that December.

=== CBS Studio 52 ===
The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) leased the New Yorker Theatre in August 1942 for use as a radio soundstage. The theater operated as a radio and television studio for three decades, known as Radio Playhouse No. 4 or Theater No. 4., then converted for television in 1949, becoming CBS-TV Studio 52. Shielded television cameras had to be developed due to strong magnetic interference from equipment at a neighboring power substation for the New York City Subway system. The studio was one of seven that CBS operated in New York City. At that time, several Broadway theaters had been converted to TV studios due to a lack of studio space in the city.

Likely the first television show to be produced at Studio 52, was &quot;The 54th Street Revue&quot;, which premiered in May 1949. Another early show produced at Studio 52 was &quot;The Fred Waring Show&quot; in 1950. Studio 52 and the neighboring Studio 50 (now the Ed Sullivan Theater) were among CBS&#x27;s busiest stages by the early 1960s. The theater hosted such shows as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;, &quot;Video Village&quot;, &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Show&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour&quot;, and &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. Studio 52 was used to tape many of the CBS shows that involved panel discussions. Members of the public could also buy tickets to view these tapings. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 1965 that many of the regular audience members were older women. The soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot; was produced at Studio 52 until 1975 and was the last show to be taped there. CBS moved most of its broadcast operations out of Studio 52 in 1976 and placed the theater up for sale.

==Nightclub era==

=== Inception and opening ===
By 1976, German-born male model Uva Harden was planning to open a nightclub in New York City, which he tentatively called &quot;Studio&quot;. Harden and Israeli entrepreneur Yoram Polany agreed to take over the old CBS Studio 52 that year. Polany and another friend of Harden&#x27;s independently recommended that the nightclub be called &quot;Studio 54&quot; because it was on 54th Street. Harden and Polany formed a corporation to operate the nightclub, but they struggled to obtain a liquor license from the New York State Liquor Authority (NYSLA). They hired , who had hosted monthly parties at Maurice Brahms&#x27;s Infinity nightclub, as the club&#x27;s publicist. To finance the nightclub, the operators of the Marlborough Gallery bought nearly all of the stock in Harden and Polany&#x27;s corporation in November 1976. At the time, the gallery&#x27;s owner Frank Lloyd had just been ordered to pay $9 million to artist Mark Rothko&#x27;s estate in the Rothko case.

After continued delays, Harden met with entrepreneurs Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, who agreed to partner with him in the nightclub&#x27;s operation. Harden was eventually forced out of the club&#x27;s operation, while Polany left on his own volition. In November 1976, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that Schrager and Rubell planned to convert the theater into a nightclub called Studio 54. It would be one of several discotheques to operate in Midtown Manhattan during the late 1970s. Rubell and Schrager formed the Broadway Catering Corp., which spent $400,000 to transform the theater into a nightclub. Rubell, Schrager, and Jack Dushey each owned a one-third stake in the venture, and they had hired several people to create the club by early 1977. These included architect Scott Bromley, interior designer Ron Doud, lighting designer Brian Thompson, and set designer Richie Williamson. Lighting designers Jules Fisher and Paul Marantz were hired to design the dance floor and rigging system. Rubell and Schrager retained D&#x27;Alessio to promote Studio 54.
The renovation involved the construction of a dance floor, a balcony, and a disco booth, as well as the addition of mirrors, light bars, and floating vinyl platforms. The orchestra seated 250 people, and the balcony had another 500 seats. The lighting system, which required three people to operate, included a dozen poles with flashing lights. Fisher and Marantz adapted the existing rigging system to generate special effects such as confetti, snow, fog, and weather. On the ceiling was a cyclorama, which could project images of many different galaxies. Other decorations included depictions of volcanos, sunrises, and sunsets. Aero Graphics designed a backlit moon and spoon, which became an icon of the Studio 54 nightclub. The club&#x27;s promoters mailed out 8,000 invitations and made phone calls to numerous figures on &quot;a good social list&quot;. Studio 54 officially opened on April 26, 1977, with workers rushing to finish the decorations just hours before the grand opening. Although the space could fit 2,500 guests, four thousand people attended the club on opening day. Hundreds of prospective patrons lined up around the block to enter, and several celebrities could not get in, despite having been invited.

===The scene===
Studio 54 had been launched as the disco dancing and music trend was gaining popularity in the U.S.&lt; Its popularity grew rapidly, especially after the publication of a widely-circulated picture that showed actress Bianca Jagger at the club, riding a white horse. In the month after its opening, the club served an average of 2,000 guests per night, although it was only open on Tuesdays through Saturdays. By August 1977, the club had become so successful that Rubell and Schrager were considering opening similar nightclubs in Los Angeles and London. Rubell ultimately chose not to open similar clubs around the world, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m very cautious about protecting the name and not cheapening it.&quot; In November 1977, Dan Dorfman of &quot;New York&quot; magazine quoted Rubell as saying that &quot;only the Mafia made more money&quot; than Studio 54, which made $7 million in its first year.

Upon Studio 54&#x27;s first anniversary in April 1978, which attracted 3,000 guests, Rubell said the club&#x27;s popularity contradicted sentiments that the club &quot;wouldn&#x27;t last more than a couple of months&quot;. That October, Rubell and Schrager closed the club for nine days, spending $500,000 on renovations. The work included adding spotlights and mirrored walls, as well as a movable bridge.

====Admission policy====
To be admitted to Studio 54 was a status symbol, even on nights when the club was open to the public. When Studio 54 opened, admission generally cost $7 or $8, but guests could pay for an annual membership in exchange for discounted tickets. Tickets were more expensive on weekends, and all ticket prices were increased on nights with performances. Rubell made the final decisions over whether guests were allowed in the club. Celebrities usually were allowed to enter immediately. According to a 1977 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, &quot;very beautiful&quot; members of the public were almost always admitted, while men entering alone were invariably rejected to prevent predatory behavior. Guests were divided into four categories, ranging from the &quot;No Goods&quot; (who could never be admitted) to the &quot;No Fuck-ups&quot; (important clients who were admitted instantly). Rubell bragged about the club&#x27;s exclusivity, saying in a November 1977 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine: &quot;I turned away 1,400 people last Saturday.&quot;

The club&#x27;s doormen could be extremely selective, sometimes to the point that &quot;they propelled themselves into a comedy universe&quot; according to Haden-Guest. Rubell once told a &quot;ravishingly beautiful woman&quot; that she could enter for free if she took off all her clothes; the woman was later hospitalized for frostbitten nipples. The selective admissions policies led some guests to bypass the front door in an attempt to enter. According to Haden-Guest, one potential guest got stuck in a ventilation shaft and died, an account that Schrager later confirmed. Some of Studio 54&#x27;s spurned clientele fled to other clubs such as New York, New York. When the club was renovated in 1978, Rubell and Schrager sealed its courtyard to prevent people from entering there. There was also a private entrance on 53rd Street, reflecting the &quot;stratification&quot; of the nightclub.

On several occasions, would-be guests attacked the doormen after being denied admission, and several guests pulled out guns when they were rejected. The club&#x27;s security guards often cleared out trash cans within a several-block radius because of high concerns over violence. Some notables were denied admission. For instance, the president of Cyprus was once rejected because the doormen thought he was the president of New York City&#x27;s Cypress Hills Cemetery. When one of Saudi king Khalid&#x27;s sons was rejected, the Saudi embassy to the United States wrote Rubell a letter, asking that Khalid&#x27;s son not be rejected again. The band Chic wrote a song in 1978, &quot;Le Freak&quot;, after being refused entry to the club on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1977, despite having been invited by Grace Jones. Even club members were not guaranteed entry. In June 1978, the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) mandated that Rubell and Schrager stop selling memberships and refund existing members. The club failed to refund all memberships immediately, and Schrager claimed that November that only 40 members had applied for refunds.

====Inside the club====
The club generally opened at 10 p.m., with crowds peaking at midnight; the bar closed at 4 a.m., and the rest of the club stayed open until 6 a.m. According to Rubell, the vast majority of the club&#x27;s guests were not celebrities but, rather, members of the public who just wanted to dance. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in November 1977 that the club attracted &quot;a mix of punks, hairdressers, socialites, and suburbanites&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the club was &quot;tolerant of errant squares&quot;. Andy Warhol, a regular guest of Studio 54, said the club was &quot;a dictatorship on the door but a democracy on the dance floor&quot;. Studio 54 enforced a photography ban to protect guests&#x27; privacy, but some images were still published, including a widely circulated image of Canadian first lady Margaret Trudeau without her underwear.

Many guests used club drugs, and they often engaged in open sexual activity on the club&#x27;s balcony and in private basement rooms. The &quot;Journal&quot; characterized most of the women guests as &quot;beneficiaries of a fabulously lucky genetic selection&quot; and that the men guests generally had an &quot;aura of self-esteem born in the knowledge that one can successfully choose among the select&quot;. Celebrity appearances, which were almost guaranteed, were frequently showcased in New York City&#x27;s daily newspapers and in gossip columns. The nightclub was also frequented by many gay celebrities, leading Anthony Haden-Guest to write that the club became &quot;one of the single most effective showcases for newly visible gay clout&quot;. By 1978, there was a private dance floor behind a movable scrim on the main dance floor, as well as a VIP room in the basement, which could only be accessed by a hidden stairway.

The club also hosted private parties that, at a minimum, cost tens of thousands of dollars. The invitations to the parties were extravagant, using such materials as &quot;Cupid&#x27;s arrows, inflatable hearts, [or] jars of confetti&quot;. Among the events at Studio 54 was a New Year&#x27;s Eve party hosted by event planner Robert Isabell, who dumped four tons of glitter onto the floor, creating a four-inch layer that could be found in attendees&#x27; clothing and homes several months later. The organizers of a Valentine&#x27;s Day party in 1979 imported 3,000 Dutch tulips, transported of sod from Bermuda, and rented eight antique sculptures that each cost $17,000. Other events at the club included fundraisers for local politicians, as well as a Halloween party hosted by the staff of &quot;People&quot; magazine. Studio 54 was also a filming location for several music videos, such as those for several songs in Musique&#x27;s album &quot;Keep On Jumpin&#x27;&quot;.

==== License issues and other disputes ====
Schrager did not have a liquor license when the club opened, despite having applied to the NYSLA for such a license. Instead, the nightclub applied for a &quot;caterers&#x27; permit&quot; every day; these permits were intended for weddings or political events, but they technically allowed the venue to serve alcohol. The club also did not have a certificate of occupancy or a public assembly license, prompting tipsters to complain to several federal agencies. On May 21, 1977, the NYSLA raided the nightclub for selling liquor without a license. The club reopened the next night, serving fruit juice and soda instead of liquor. Studio 54 continued serving non-alcoholic drinks exclusively until a justice for the New York Supreme Court, the state&#x27;s trial-level court, ordered the NYSLA to grant Studio 54 a liquor license that October. The NYSLA&#x27;s chairman complied with the Supreme Court ruling but objected to it, claiming that the judge had been influenced by Studio 54&#x27;s upscale clientele. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in June 1978.

Schrager also applied for a cabaret license from the DCA, which did not grant Studio 54 a permanent cabaret license for more than a year. A contributing factor was that the city government only employed three cabaret inspectors, who could not validate all of the city&#x27;s cabaret licenses in a timely manner. Additionally, the DCA rarely fined unlicensed cabarets more than $25. At the beginning of June 1978, DCA officials said the cabaret application had not been approved because of multiple violations of fire codes, though the New York City Fire Department refused to provide further details about these violations. The DCA could also deny a permanent license because of unresolved consumer complaints, such as those concerning Studio 54&#x27;s annual memberships. The DCA refused to renew Studio 54&#x27;s temporary cabaret license in August 1978 because Schrager and Rubell had not refunded all of the memberships.

Also in August 1978, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) sued Rubell and Schrager, alleging that the co-owners had failed to pay licensing fees for six performances that ASCAP had staged at Studio 54 earlier that year. Studio 54 ultimately paid ASCAP for a license in November 1978. The National Labor Relations Board was also investigating the club by February 1979 after some workers alleged that the club had engaged in unfair labor practices.

==== End of the first era ====

In December 1978, a tipster called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), alleging that Rubell and Schrager were skimming profits. The tip came from a disgruntled ex-employee, who also alleged that cocaine was illegally being stored in the basement. Shortly after, IRS agents raided Studio 54 and arrested Rubell and Schrager. The club continued to operate the night of the raid. A federal grand jury indicted Rubell and Schrager on charges of tax evasion in June 1979, observing that the two men had skimmed $2.5 million, or as much as 60 percent of Studio 54&#x27;s receipts over the past two years. In an unsuccessful attempt to lessen the charges against the club&#x27;s co-owners, Schrager&#x27;s lawyer Mitchell Rogovin alleged that Hamilton Jordan, chief of staff to U.S. president Jimmy Carter, had used cocaine in the club&#x27;s basement. In anticipation of increasing interest in rock music, Rubell and Schrager spent $1.2 million to renovate Studio 54 in late 1979. They installed a grand chandelier and a fly system above the stage, as well as removing seats from the balcony.

Rubell and Schrager ultimately pleaded guilty to tax evasion in November 1979, after &quot;New York&quot; magazine published a cover story describing the &quot;party favors&quot; that the two men gave to their friends. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed not to charge the men with obstruction of justice and conspiracy. By then, the club was in danger of losing its liquor license after the owners had pleaded guilty to tax evasion, as the NYSLA did not give liquor licenses to convicted felons. Rubell and Schrager were each sentenced to three and a half years in prison in January 1980. The two men attended a final party on the night of February 2–3, 1980, with Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli singing for numerous guests. Rubell and Schrager began serving their sentences two days afterward. Ultimately, Rubell and Schrager were paroled after a year, and Schrager received a Presidential Pardon decades later.

The NYSLA unanimously voted not to renew Studio 54&#x27;s liquor license on February 28, 1980, citing Rubell&#x27;s and Schrager&#x27;s criminal convictions, although the club was allowed to continue operating. The club lost its liquor license on February 29, and the club started serving fruit punch the next day. Studio 54&#x27;s lawyers also announced that they would create a board of directors to operate the club. The third co-owner, Jack Dushey, had received a $10,000 fine and had been sentenced to five years of unsupervised probation after being convicted of conspiracy charges in March 1980. By the end of that month, Rubell was considering selling the club, despite having promised just two months prior that he would never sell Studio 54. Among those who expressed interest in the club were restaurateur Mark Fleischman, television host Dick Clark, and record executive Neil Bogart. The club closed down at the end of that March, as the revocation of the liquor license had caused a sharp decrease in business. Early the next month, Fleischman agreed to buy an option that would allow him to purchase the club for $5 million.

===Fleischman and Weiss operation===
Mark Fleischman announced his plan to take over Studio 54, seeking to host live shows there and obtain a liquor license from the NYSLA. Studio 54 remained shuttered through the rest of the year, in large part because Rubell and Schrager continued to file legal objections against the NYSLA&#x27;s revocation of the club&#x27;s liquor license. The authority would not issue a liquor license as long as the club was involved in active litigation. Mike Stone Productions leased the club from Rubell and Schrager in early 1981, and the club started hosting private events again, albeit without alcoholic drinks and only on Friday and Saturday nights. Rubell&#x27;s company sold the building to Philip Pilevsky for $1.15 million in cash in August 1981, leasing back space from Pilevsky. Fleischman applied for a liquor license from the NYSLA, which agreed to grant the license on the condition that Rubell and Schrager not be involved in any way. Fleischman also repainted the interior and removed the original club&#x27;s light fixtures, and he paid the New York state government $250,000 in back taxes.

Studio 54 officially reopened to the public on September 15, 1981. Fleischman and his partner Jeffrey London mailed out 12,000 invitations for Studio 54&#x27;s reopening, which were delivered on 25-watt silver lightbulbs. Jim Fouratt and Rudolf Piper were hired as Studio 54&#x27;s new managers. Initially, the club hosted &quot;Modern Classix nights&quot; during Wednesdays and Sundays, while it hosted disco music for the remainder of the week. There was also a 32-track recording studio in the basement, which was used for recording promotional videos and rock concerts. Notable figures associated with the second iteration of Studio 54 included doorman Haoui Montaug, as well as Paul Heyman, who was a photographer, producer, and promoter at the club. A notable guest during this time was Drew Barrymore, who was nine years old when her mother took her to Studio 54. Within three months of the club&#x27;s reopening, Fleischman had ousted Fouratt and Piper, who opened the Danceteria nightclub.

In 1982, social activist Jerry Rubin started hosting &quot;Business Networking Salons&quot;, a networking event for businesspeople, at the club on Wednesday nights. Prospective guests would only be admitted if they had a business card; the networking events quickly became popular, often attracting 1,500 guests. For other events, Studio 54 implemented an invitation system, which enabled its operators to restrict some events to select guests without turning them away at the door. The club&#x27;s mailing list had 200,000 names by 1984. Frank Cashman acquired the $3 million lien on the club in late 1984. The same year, Studio 54 also hosted special musical performances, starting with a series of concerts by Julie Budd. Meanwhile, the club was gradually losing long-time regulars to competing discotheques, including the Palladium, which Rubell and Schrager had opened after being released from prison. The club also faced several lawsuits from disgruntled high-profile guests, such as football player Mark Gastineau and a basketball player.

Fleischman filed for bankruptcy in November 1985; he had planned to spend $250,000 on renovations to attract guests. The club closed in April 1986 because it could not obtain liability insurance, in part because Studio 54 was losing so many of the lawsuits in which it was involved. Subsequently, Shalom Weiss took over Studio 54. The nightclub tended to attract a young and racially mixed clientele who were frequently involved in fights, prompting complaints from local residents. City officials revoked the club&#x27;s cabaret license for two years in January 1989 after finding that the club&#x27;s patrons frequently used cocaine illegally. The officials alleged that Studio 54 employees not only encouraged illegal drug use but also used cocaine themselves. In addition, the club admitted guests as young as 13 and had falsely advertised itself as selling alcoholic beverages.

=== The Ritz and Cabaret Royale ===

Studio 54 was dilapidated by the late 1980s; the walls had peeling paint, while the auditorium&#x27;s dome had been concealed by a dropped ceiling. Neil Cohen and John Scher, owners of the Ritz nightclub, leased the space from Philip Pilevsky for 25 years in 1989. They spent $2 million to restore the theater, adding fixed seating at orchestra level and installing production equipment above the stage. Cohen and Scher anticipated that the club could fit 3,000 people, including standees, although the theater only had about 1,800 seats. The Ritz relocated from the East Village to Studio 54 on April 5, 1989. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the new Ritz was more popular than the old location because both the orchestra and balcony had &quot;excellent sound and sightlines&quot;. The Ritz was primarily a rock club, but it also hosted performances of pop music and salsa music. The Ritz was one of the most active nightclubs in the United States, with about 150 shows annually, until its promoters started booking fewer shows in mid-1991. Despite declining profits in 1992, the club&#x27;s owners were planning to add a 250-seat side room next to the auditorium.

CAT Entertainment acquired Scher&#x27;s interest in the Ritz in December 1992, and CAT was itself acquired by Cabaret Royale Corporation the next year. In July 1993, the Ritz announced it would close down and reopen as a topless bar. CAT Entertainment spent $3 million renovating the theater, including the stage area. CAT also resurrected both the nightclub and the Studio 54 trademark, which had never been properly registered by any of the prior owners or operators. John Neilson took over the venue with plans to reopen it as an uptown location of the Stringfellows nightclub. The remodeled nightclub opened in January 1994 and was operated as &quot;Cabaret Royale at Studio 54&quot;. Most of the old theater&#x27;s architectural detail had been covered up by then.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Tokyo had previously granted a mortgage on the theater and the adjacent office building to Pilevsky, which it foreclosed upon in June 1994. Later that month, the theater and building were auctioned off. CBS, the Manhattan Theatre Club, and Viacom were among those that showed interest in acquiring the theater and building. Allied Partners, run by the Hadar family, ultimately acquired the properties for $5.5 million. Allied then renovated the office building. Cabaret Royale closed in January 1995, and Allied announced plans to convert the space into a virtual reality gaming venue at a cost of $10 million. In anticipation of Studio 54&#x27;s conversion, the nightclub hosted a final party on May 23, 1996, featuring disco star Gloria Gaynor and performers such as Crystal Waters and RuPaul. The virtual-reality complex was never built because of a lack of demand, and the club&#x27;s space was instead rented out for private events. Allied Partners preferred that the Studio 54 building become &quot;anything but a nightclub&quot;.

== Roundabout Theatre at Studio 54 ==

Since 1998, the nonprofit Roundabout Theatre Company has operated Studio 54 as a Broadway theater, branded as Roundabout Theatre at Studio 54. It is one of Roundabout&#x27;s three Broadway theaters, alongside the Todd Haimes Theatre and the Stephen Sondheim Theatre.

=== Relocation and early productions ===
In July 1998, the collapse of a construction hoist at 4 Times Square blocked access to the Henry Miller Theatre (now Stephen Sondheim Theatre) on 43rd Street, where the nonprofit Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s successful revival of the Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; was playing. Roundabout quickly began searching for alternative venues and, in September 1998, decided to move the production to Studio 54. The old nightclub required extensive renovations and was not air-conditioned, but Roundabout&#x27;s artistic director Todd Haimes considered it the &quot;only viable option&quot; for the theatre company. &quot;Cabaret&quot; producer Sam Mendes had considered Studio 54&#x27;s dilapidated condition to be an ideal setting for the production, just as the Henry Miller had been. Roundabout spent over $1 million converting the former nightclub into a 950-seat theater, buying old seats from the Imperial Theatre and installing them in the mezzanine. &quot;Cabaret&quot; moved to Studio 54 in November 1998, doubling the production&#x27;s capacity.

Richard Hadar announced in early 1999 that he would operate a nightclub within the theater, which would still host performances of &quot;Cabaret&quot; during the day. By 2001, Roundabout was negotiating to buy Studio 54 from the Hadar family, which would allow the theatre company to own a Broadway theater for the first time. Early the next year, the Hadar family agreed to sell the theater for around $25 million. To fund the purchase, Roundabout would receive up to $32 million in tax-exempt bonds and $9 million from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA). Roundabout finalized its purchase in July 2003, paying $22.5 million, of which $6.75 million came from the DCA and $17.7 million came from tax-exempt bonds. Allied continued to own the office space above the theater.

=== 2000s ===
Roundabout planned to use Studio 54 to host larger productions that could not be staged at the American Airlines Theatre. Haimes also wanted to renovate the theater, including expanding the orchestra pit and replacing the rigging system. After &quot;Cabaret&quot; closed in January 2004, Roundabout staged several shows a year at both theaters, and Studio 54 hosted a mixture of musicals and plays. The Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman musical &quot;Assassins&quot; was Roundabout&#x27;s first new production at Studio 54, opening in April 2004. A revival of another musical by the same team, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, opened that December. Following these two productions, Broadway historian Louis Botto wrote that Studio 54 &quot;had finally fully been welcomed into the Broadway family nearly 80 years after Fortune Gallo first dreamed of it&quot;.

Roundabout completed some renovations in 2005, which involved installing raked seating and an exhibit in the promenade. The theater hosted a revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in April 2005. For the 2005–2006 season, Studio 54 staged Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. The theater then hosted the plays &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; and &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; in the 2006–2007 season; &quot;The Ritz&quot; and &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; in the 2007–2008 season; and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in the 2008–2009 season. For the 2009–2010 season, the theater presented Carrie Fisher&#x27;s solo performance &quot;Wishful Drinking&quot;, as well as and James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s revue &quot;Sondheim on Sondheim&quot;.

=== 2010s to present ===
During the 2010–2011 season, Studio 54 hosted &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (an adaptation of two Noël Coward works), as well as the musical &quot;The People in the Picture&quot;. Studio 54 was supposed to host a revival of Bob Fosse&#x27;s musical &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; during the 2011–2012 season, but this was ultimately canceled, and the theater was instead closed for renovations. The theater&#x27;s next production was the play &quot;Harvey&quot;, which opened in June 2012. This was followed in November by &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, the theater&#x27;s only production for the 2012–2013 season. Roundabout booked a revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; for the 2013–2014 season, although the theater remained dark for a year. &quot;Cabaret&quot; opened in April 2014, initially for a 24-week engagement, but the show was so popular that it ran for a year. The play &quot;An Act of God&quot; opened at Studio 54 in May 2015, being the theater&#x27;s only production during the 2014–2015 season.

The theater then returned to presenting two productions per season. Studio 54 hosted the play &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and a revival of the musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot; during the 2015–2016 season, followed by the musical &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; and the play &quot;Sweat&quot; during the 2016–2017 season. Next, the theater hosted John Leguizamo&#x27;s solo show &quot;Latin History for Morons&quot; and an American Sign Language revival of &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; in 2017–2018. The theater staged &quot;The Lifespan of a Fact&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; for the 2018–2019 season. Studio 54 hosted Adam Rapp&#x27;s play &quot;The Sound Inside&quot;, which opened in October 2019. Studio 54 was supposed to host the musical &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot; during the 2019–2020 season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Studio 54 closed on March 12, 2020, a day before previews of &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot; were supposed to start. That show&#x27;s opening had originally been delayed to early 2021, but it was pushed further due to the extension of COVID-19 restrictions.

Studio 54 reopened on October 8, 2021, with previews of &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot;, which officially opened later that month. This was followed from April to July 2022 by the Tracy Letts play &quot;The Minutes&quot;, then by the Sharr White play &quot;Pictures from Home&quot; from February to April 2023. The musical &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; opened at Studio 54 in January 2024, running for three months. It was followed in November 2024 by the musical &quot;A Wonderful World&quot;.

== Notable productions ==
Productions are listed by the year of their first performance.

=== Gallo Opera House/New Yorker Theatre ===

=== Studio 54 (Roundabout) ===

== Legacy ==
By the late 1970s, the original nightclub had spurred the creation of Studio 54-themed jeans, a record label, an album, and a Japanese club. &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; magazine described Studio 54 as &quot;the nightclub where the velvet rope was born&quot;, its impact evident long after the venue had been converted back to a theater. &quot;GQ&quot; magazine wrote in 2020: &quot;When you want to designate a particular brand of louche elegance on a night-time scene, Studio 54 is the natural first port of comparative call.&quot;

=== Cultural impact ===

The nightclub has been the subject of several works of popular media. The original Studio 54 was featured in the 1998 drama film &quot;54&quot;. &quot;Studio 54&quot;, a 98-minute documentary by Matt Tyrnauer released in 2018, includes unpublished footage of the club and interviews with Ian Schrager. Additionally, the fourth season of the television series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, announced in 2021, focuses on the club during the 1970s. Several books have also been written about the nightclub. The writer Anthony Haden-Guest published a book about Studio 54 and the disco subculture in 1997, and Mark Fleischman published his memoir &quot;Inside Studio 54&quot; in October 2017. Schrager also published a book in 2018, &quot;Studio 54&quot;, with images of the club. In 2024, Robert Greenblatt and Neil Meron began producing &quot;Studio 54 the Musical&quot;, a Broadway musical about the club.

Studio 54 has also had an influence on disco music. Casablanca Records released a compilation album of disco music, &quot;A Night at Studio 54&quot;, in 1979; it peaked at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and sold close to a million copies. In 2011, Sirius XM launched Studio 54 Radio, a satellite radio station featuring classic disco and dance tracks from the 1970s to the 2000s. In 2020, it expanded into a music imprint including a record label, Studio 54 Music, which works with Sirius XM on Studio 54 Radio. The label&#x27;s first release, &quot;Night Magic Vol. 1&quot;, is a four-track compilation EP of disco anthems from the club&#x27;s prime days, revised by musicians from both the original scene and the modern dance music era. Studio 54 also inspired the name and overall concept of singer-songwriter Dua Lipa&#x27;s 2020 concert series &quot;Studio 2054&quot;.

The club has been featured in several exhibitions. These include an exhibit of Studio 54 photographs, which Haden-Guest presented at the WhiteBox art gallery in 2015. as well as a Brooklyn Museum exhibition titled &quot;Night Magic&quot;, which premiered in 2020. In addition, multiple Studio 54-themed collections from fashion and cosmetics brands, including Calvin Klein, Michael Kors and NARS Cosmetics, were released in 2019. The collections took inspiration from the club&#x27;s glamorous heyday and showcased the iconic &quot;54&quot; logo.

Several venues have been likened to Studio 54. Fiorucci, an Italian fashion shop formerly located on East 59th Street, became known in the late 1970s as the &quot;daytime Studio 54&quot;. The Mutiny Hotel in Miami, Florida, was described in a &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot; interview as &quot;kind of the closest thing to Miami&#x27;s Studio 54&quot; in the late 1970s. The nightclub also inspired the creation of a Studio 54-themed nightclub at the MGM Grand Las Vegas hotel and casino in 1997; that club operated until 2012.

=== Memorabilia and preservation ===
Before Rubell died in 1989, he saved &quot;every single item&quot; that he collected from the nightclub, such as the reservation book, invitation cards, and drink tickets. More than 400 of these items were sold at an auction in West Palm Beach, Florida, in January 2013, attracting hundreds of buyers. The auction yielded $316,680; the most expensive item was a $52,800 Andy Warhol sculpture.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) had started considering protecting Studio 54 as a landmark in 1982, with discussions continuing over the next several years. The LPC commenced a wide-ranging effort to grant landmark status to Broadway theaters in 1987, and the commission considered designating Studio 54&#x27;s interior as a landmark. Ultimately, although the LPC protected 28 Broadway theaters as landmarks, Studio 54 was not one of them.

<text>Goodrich is a village and civil parish in south Herefordshire, England close to Gloucestershire and the Forest of Dean, situated near the River Wye at . It is known for its Norman and mediaeval castle built with Old Red Sandstone.

The parish includes the neighbouring hamlet of Symonds Yat East and had population at the 2011 census of 550.

The village grew up next to Goodrich Castle, a &#x27;Marcher Castle&#x27; dating to c. 1101 which stands on a high spur of land commanding a strategic position above Kerne Bridge, an ancient crossing point of the Wye.
Goodrich is on the A40 trunk road which forms part of the main route between South Wales and the West Midlands but is in a sheltered rural location. Goodrich has not retained its village shop or post office but has kept a village hall and two public houses. The village has a tennis club with three all-weather courts and an active village cricket club.

The Coppett hill nature reserve stretches along a hill above the Wye south of the village.

==Church==

The Church of St Giles contains the tomb of the Countess of Salisbury, who was charged by Henry Bolingbroke with bringing up his son, later to become King Henry V, after the death of Mary de Bohun his first wife. The young boy was brought up at nearby Courtfield at Welsh Bicknor.

== Goodrich Castle ==
Goodrich Castle was first known as &quot;Castellum Godrici&quot; after Godric of Mappestone, the builder of the first castle on the site. Over time the name changed to Goodrich and the castle changed hands many times through the centuries, passing from family to family. In 1646, near the end of the English Civil War, the castle was besieged and captured, using a cannon cast in the Forest of Dean called Roaring Meg, from Sir Henry Lingen by Parliamentarians led by Colonel Birch. The castle is now in the care of English Heritage.

==Goodrich Court==
Goodrich Court was a country house built between 1828 and 1831 by Sir Samuel Meyrick. Goodrich Court and other nearby buildings became the evacuation home to Felsted School in the World War II years 1940–1945. Although demolished in the 1950s, Goodrich Court Stables and its walled garden still exists. Sculptor Jon Edgar lived and worked here between 2004 and 2007.

==Rocklands House==
Rocklands House is listed on the English Heritage Register. It was built in the 1700s and substantial additions were made in 1800 It was the home of many notable people over the next two centuries.

==Role in history of aesthetics==
Goodrich&#x27;s prominent position overlooking the River Wye meant that both Castle and Court were stopping points on the first Wye Tour of William Gilpin in 1770. The trip from Ross-on-Wye to Monmouth was instrumental in the development of The Picturesque and Picturesque Tourism.

==Railways==
The village was served by the Ross and Monmouth Railway at Kerne Bridge station between 1873 and 1959 running through the scenic Wye Valley.

<text>The village of Vík (), known as Vík í Mýrdal (, ) in full, is the southernmost village in Iceland. It is located on the main ring road around the island, and is around southeast of Reykjavík by road.

Despite its small size (750 inhabitants in Mýrdalshreppur as of January 2021) it is the largest settlement for some around and is an important staging post. It is an important service center for both inhabitants and visitors to the coastal strip between Skógar and the west edge of the Mýrdalssandur glacial outwash plain.

==Overview==
In 1991, the US journal &quot;Islands Magazine&quot; counted the beach at Vík as one of the ten most beautiful beaches on Earth. Its stretch of black basalt sand is one of the wettest places in Iceland. The cliffs west of the beach are home to many seabirds, most notably puffins which burrow into the shallow soils during nesting season. Offshore lie stacks of basalt rock, remnants of a once more extensive cliffline (), now battered by the sea. According to folklore, the sea stacks are former trolls who tried to drag their boats out to sea only to be caught by the rising dawn. The sea around them is rather wild and stormy, and travelers will note a monument to the memory of drowned seamen on the beach.

Contemporary legends tell the story of a husband who found his wife taken by the two trolls, and frozen at night. The husband made the two trolls swear to never kill anyone ever again. His wife was the love of his life, whose free spirit he was unable to provide a home for. She found her fate out among the trolls, rocks, and sea at Reynisfjara ().

The village was affected by volcanic ash during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull.

==Danger from the Katla volcano==
Vík lies directly south of the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, which itself is on top of the Katla volcano. Katla has not erupted since 1918, and as this is longer than typical dormant period, there has been speculation that an eruption may occur soon. An eruption of Katla could melt enough ice to trigger an enormous flash flood, potentially large enough to obliterate the entire town. The town&#x27;s church, located high on a hill, is believed to be the only building that would survive such a flood. The people of Vík are aware that they may only have 15 minutes to evacuate to the church at the first sign of an eruption. The town has 1,400 hotel rooms for scientists and tourists, who are also briefed about Katla&#x27;s dangers.

==Climate==
Vík í Mýrdal is the warmest place in Iceland, with an annual mean temperature of . Like most of coastal Iceland, Vík í Mýrdal has a subpolar oceanic climate (Koppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) with cold but not severe winters, and cool, short summers. Its winters are among the warmest in Iceland, with an average winter day having a daytime high around . Because it lies on the windward side of the Gulf Stream, Vík í Mýrdal is the wettest coastal town in Iceland, with an annual rainfall of , which is three times more than Reykjavík, five times more than Akureyri on the north coast of the island, and many times more than its far northern location would normally indicate. Precipitation on the Mýrdalsjökull and Vatnajökull glaciers near the town is believed to be as high as of rainfall equivalent, which would mean at least of snow at those higher altitudes. 
==Sports==
*Ungmennafélagið Katla is a sports club based in Vík í Mýrdal.

== In popular culture ==
Vík í Mýrdal serves as the primary setting of Netflix&#x27;s Icelandic original series &quot;Katla&quot;, which follows a group of the village&#x27;s inhabitants as they struggle in the aftermath of the volcano&#x27;s first eruption since 1918.

<doc id="693669" wikidata="Q4051072" url="?curid=693669" title="The Fibonaccis">
<text>The Fibonaccis were an American art rock band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles. The band consisted of songwriters John Dentino (keyboards) and Ron Stringer (guitar), Magie Song (vocals), Joe Berardi (drums) and later Tom Corey (bass).

==Formation==
The Fibonaccis were formed out of the Los Angeles art punk scene which included bands such as Wall of Voodoo and Oingo Boingo. Deriving their name from 13th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci and citing musical influence from Nino Rota and Ennio Morricone, the band&#x27;s music was typically characterized by intricate piano and guitar lines, over-the-top and sometimes incomprehensible vocals and frequent use of unconventional instruments such as mandolins, clarinets and Mellotrons. The Fibonaccis&#x27; music was nearly impossible to categorize, fusing such disparate elements as post-punk, progressive rock, jazz, world music, cabaret, ambient, spoken word and funk, a combination one newspaper critic described as &quot;elevator music from hell&quot;. Lyrically, the band regularly explored dark and esoteric subject matter ranging from serial killers to UFOs, presented in a satirical and surrealist fashion.

==Career==
The Fibonaccis released their debut EP &quot;(fi&#x27;-bo-na&#x27;-chez)&quot; in 1982, following up with a 12&quot; single/EP, &quot;Tumor/Psycho/Slow Beautiful Sex&quot;, the next year. In 1984, the group independently filmed a music video for an unreleased cover of Jimi Hendrix″s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. Played in an instrumentally discordant fashion and sung in screeched vocals, the psychedelic music video re-worked the song into an anthem for a cult, book-ended by audio clips from Charles Manson interviews.

By the mid-1980s, the Fibonaccis had emerged as a prominent presence in the Los Angeles art rock scene, acting as touring support for the likes of Sparks, Oingo Boingo and Wall of Voodoo and performing as part of the 1985 New Music America festival.

Throughout their career, the Fibonaccis regularly contributed their music to independent film soundtracks. In 1986, the band collaborated with composer Richard Band on the score for the horror-comedy &quot;TerrorVision&quot;, recording five tracks including the movie&#x27;s theme song. Their song &quot;Sergio Leone&quot; was used for the closing credits of 1982&#x27;s &quot;Android&quot; and the previously unrecorded track &quot;Art Life&quot; was featured in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Slam Dance&quot;. The Fibonaccis appeared onscreen as the band &quot;Sexy Holiday&quot; in the 1987 comedy &quot;Valet Girls&quot;, lipsynching to &quot;Slow Beautiful Sex&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze&quot; during a party scene.

In 1987, the band released their sole studio LP, &quot;Civilization and Its Discotheques,&quot; on the Blue Yonder Sounds label. In explaining the reason for the LP&#x27;s delay, the group said that various hassles and difficulties with record companies had plagued a more timely release. Their frustration over the album&#x27;s recording, added with a lack of media recognition, led to their breakup in 1988.

In 1992, Restless Records released a 26-track retrospective of the band&#x27;s work called &quot;Repressed - The Best of the Fibonaccis&quot;. To celebrate the release of the album, the Fibonaccis performed a one-off reunion show in Los Angeles on November 19, 1992, their final public performance with all the members.

==Post-Fibonaccis==
Following the Fibonaccis&#x27; disbandment, John Dentino continued to compose music independently and has recently been working on independent documentary films. Joe Berardi went on to perform and tour with Wall of Voodoo&#x27;s Stan Ridgway, and has collaborated with artists including Lydia Lunch, Congo Norvell, Donovan and Rufus Wainwright. Magie Song acted in a number of independent films in the early 1990s, including Gregg Araki″s &quot;The Living End&quot; and Stephen Sayadian″s &quot;Dr. Caligari&quot;, and currently works as an acupuncturist in Los Angeles. Tom Corey died from a cerebral aneurysm in late 2001. Ron Stringer served as film editor and critic for the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and later as an English professor in L.A.&#x27;s community colleges. He died from liver cancer in late 2021.

Currently, the entire Fibonaccis physical discography is out of print, with &quot;Repressed&quot; being their only work released on compact disc. In 2021, the group released the majority of their repertoire on worldwide music streaming services and created a Bandcamp page for digital download. In 2022, The Fibonaccis opened their archives and digitally released two new collections of live radio shows, club rarities, and demos.

<doc id="693671" wikidata="Q6939251" url="?curid=693671" title="Murray Gleeson">
<text>Anthony Murray Gleeson (born 30 August 1938) is an Australian former judge who served as the 11th Chief Justice of Australia, in office from 1998 to 2008.

Gleeson was born in Wingham, New South Wales, and studied law at the University of Sydney. He was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1963 and appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1974, becoming one of the state&#x27;s leading barristers. Gleeson was appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1988, serving until his elevation to the High Court in 1998. He and Samuel Griffith (appointed 1903) are the only people to have been elevated directly from the chief justiceship of a state to the chief justiceship of the High Court. As required by the constitution, he retired from the court when he reached his 70th birthday.

In October 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Gleeson&#x27;s daughter, Jacqueline Gleeson, will be elevated to the High Court following the retirement of Justice Virginia Bell.

==Early life==
Gleeson was born in Wingham, New South Wales, the eldest of four children. He was educated at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill, where he won the Lawrence Campbell Oratory Competition in both 1953 and 1955, before matriculating to receive first class honours degrees in Arts and Law from the University of Sydney. Among his graduating class of 1962 were John Howard, later to become Prime Minister; and Michael Kirby, who later served alongside him as a judge on the High Court.

==Legal career==
After graduation, Gleeson spent one year as a solicitor at Messrs Murphy &amp; Moloney. Gleeson was admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1963, where he read with Laurence Street and Anthony Mason - his future predecessors as Chief Justice of New South Wales and Chief Justice of Australia respectively.

His appearances as junior counsel focussed mainly on matters of taxation and commercial law, as well as important constitutional cases including &quot;Strickland v Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd&quot;, which concerned the scope of the corporations power.

Upon his appointment as Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1974, Gleeson&#x27;s career as senior counsel continued to focus on commercial and constitutional matters. However he also appeared in some high-profile criminal cases, including his successful defence before a jury of National Party MP Ian Sinclair in 1980. In the same year he appeared for the appellants in &quot;Port Jackson Stevedoring v Salmond &amp; Spraggon&quot;, the last case granted leave to appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court. In 1981 he appeared for former Prime Minister Sir William McMahon in &quot;Evans v Crichton-Browne&quot;, excluding the rhetoric of electoral advertising from judicial scrutiny under the Commonwealth &quot;Electoral Act 1918&quot;. Gleeson was President of the New South Wales Bar Association 1984–1985.

He was a methodical counsel, who prepared his cases and even his cross examinations in minute detail. Retired Justice of Appeal Roddy Meagher said jokingly of Gleeson: &quot;He has written nothing outside his professional work. He takes no interest in either music or art. He does, however, like flowers. He stares at them to make them wilt.&quot;

==Judicial career==
===Chief Justice of New South Wales===
Gleeson was appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1988, the first barrister to be directly elevated to the Chief Justiceship since Frederick Jordan in 1934. According to convention, he was also made Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales in 1989. During Gleeson&#x27;s decade as Chief Justice of New South Wales, the court system dealt with considerable change including fast growing demand, cost constraints and delays. He sought to delineate appropriate boundaries for the political debate surrounding litigation, and was adamant that the proper administration of justice was a part of civilised government and not a free market privilege.

The tradition of the Chief Justice frequently appearing in the Court of Criminal Appeal was continued under Gleeson&#x27;s tenure. In this role, he appeared as a judge in &quot;R v Birks&quot;, where it was found a trial counsel&#x27;s proved incompetence was a ground of appeal, and &quot;Attorney-General (NSW) v Milat&quot;, where an indigent accused was found to be entitled to legal representation as a basic requirement of fairness in a serious legal trial.

Gleeson also frequently presided in the Court of Appeal, a forum more suited to his expertise in administrative, commercial, and constitutional law. In 1992, he presided over &quot;Greiner v Independent Commission Against Corruption&quot;, which exonerated Nick Greiner from charges of corruption, although Greiner was forced to resign as Premier months earlier by independents who controlled the balance of power in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Other notable cases include &quot;Ballina Shire Council v Ringland&quot;, where he endorsed the constitutionally implied right to freedom of political communication and concluded that councillors could not sue for defamation on statements about their performance, and &quot;Egan v Willis&quot; where the New South Wales Legislative Council was found to be empowered to compel the treasurer Michael Egan (then a member of the Legislative Council) to produce documents and to suspend him for non-compliance. In &quot;Egan v Chadwick&quot;, this power was found to be not limited by legal professional privilege.

===Chief Justice of Australia===
In May 1998, Gleeson was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, replacing Sir Gerard Brennan. He was the first Chief Justice of a state supreme court to be appointed Chief Justice of the High Court since Samuel Griffith, whose own state Chief Justiceship preceded the formation of the High Court. He is also the first Chief Justice not to have been made a knight (however, Australia had ceased the practice of awarding knighthoods some years previously). During his tenure as Chief Justice, Gleeson actively maintained the importance of judicial independence in the face of increasing executive government power and public anger with court decisions. He also spoke out against the use of torture, forced confessions and detention without trial.

His tenure as Chief Justice was also characterised by a large number of joint judgments, and a relatively frequent number of judgments that clearly and plainly provide the Court&#x27;s ratio decidendi. In 2020, at least six former associates of Dyson Heydon, another member of the bench led by Murray Gleeson, accused Heydon of sexual harassment, and one alleged that another judge, Michael McHugh had told Murray Gleeson about one of alleged acts.

On 30 July 2008, it was announced that Federal Court justice Robert French would succeed Gleeson as Chief Justice. In accordance with the Australian Constitution, he retired from the High Court on 29 August 2008, the day before his 70th birthday. The occasion was marked by a ceremonial sitting of the High Court in Canberra.

===Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong===
On 7 November 2008, Gleeson was appointed a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and served until 29 February 2024. He was given a Chinese name, &quot;紀立信&quot; (Jyutping: &quot;gei2lap6seon3&quot;) by the Hong Kong Judiciary.

==Honours==
*He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1986.
*He received Australia&#x27;s highest civil honour when he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1992.
*He was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001.
*Life Fellow of the Australian Academy of Law.
*Grand Bauhinia Medal of Hong Kong in 2020.

==Personal life==
He married Robyn Paterson in 1965, and the couple have four children. Their eldest daughter, Jacqueline, was appointed a judge of the Federal Court of Australia in 2014, after practising law as a barrister at the Sydney Bar and as general counsel of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In October 2020, she was appointed to the High Court of Australia by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Another daughter, Rebecca, is married to actor Eric Bana.

In September 2006, &quot;The Australian Financial Review&quot; magazine named Gleeson Australia&#x27;s seventh most overtly powerful person.

<doc id="693673" wikidata="Q332107" url="?curid=693673" title="Transition radiation">
<text>Transition radiation (TR) is a form of electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through inhomogeneous media, such as a boundary between two different media. This is in contrast to Cherenkov radiation, which occurs when a charged particle passes through a homogeneous dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in that medium.

==History==
Transition radiation was demonstrated theoretically by Ginzburg and Frank in 1945. They showed the existence of Transition radiation when a charged particle perpendicularly passed through a boundary between two different homogeneous media. The frequency of radiation emitted in the backwards direction relative to the particle was mainly in the range of visible light. The intensity of radiation was logarithmically proportional to the Lorentz factor of the particle. After the first observation of the transition radiation in the optical region, many early studies indicated that the application of the optical transition radiation for the detection and identification of individual particles seemed to be severely limited due to the inherent low intensity of the radiation.

Interest in transition radiation was renewed when Garibian showed that the radiation should also appear in the x-ray region for ultrarelativistic particles. His theory predicted some remarkable features for transition radiation in the x-ray region. 
In 1959 Garibian showed theoretically that energy losses of an ultrarelativistic particle, when emitting TR while passing the boundary between media and vacuum, were directly proportional to the Lorentz factor of the particle. Theoretical discovery of x-ray transition radiation, which was directly proportional to the Lorentz factor, made possible further use of TR in high-energy physics.

Thus, from 1959 intensive theoretical and experimental research of TR, and x-ray TR in particular began.

==Transition radiation in the x-ray region==

Transition radiation in the x-ray region (TR) is produced by relativistic charged particles when they cross the interface of two media of different dielectric constants. The emitted radiation is the homogeneous difference between the two inhomogeneous solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations of the electric and magnetic fields of the moving particle in each medium separately. In other words, since the electric field of the particle is different in each medium, the particle has to &quot;shake off&quot; the difference when it crosses the boundary. The total energy loss of a charged particle on the transition depends on its Lorentz factor and is mostly directed forward, peaking at an angle of the order of relative to the particle&#x27;s path. The intensity of the emitted radiation is roughly proportional to the particle&#x27;s energy .

Optical transition radiation is emitted both in the forward direction and reflected by the interface surface. In case of a foil having an angle at 45 degrees with respect to a particle beam, the particle beam&#x27;s shape can be visually seen at an angle of 90 degrees. More elaborate analysis of the emitted visual radiation may allow for the determination of and emittance.

In the approximation of relativistic motion (formula_1), small angles (formula_2) and high frequency (formula_3), the energy spectrum can be expressed as:

formula_4

Where formula_5 is the atomic charge, formula_6 is the charge of an electron, formula_7 is the Lorentz factor, formula_8 is the Plasma Frequency. This divergences at low frequencies where the approximations fail. The total energy emitted is:

formula_9

The characteristics of this electromagnetic radiation makes it suitable for particle discrimination, particularly of electrons and hadrons in the momentum range between and .
The transition radiation photons produced by electrons have wavelengths in the x-ray range, with energies typically in the range from 5 to . However, the number of produced photons per interface crossing is very small: for particles with = 2×103, about 0.8 x-ray photons are detected. Usually several layers of alternating materials or composites are used to collect enough transition radiation photons for an adequate measurement—for example, one layer of inert material followed by one layer of detector (e.g. microstrip gas chamber), and so on.

By placing interfaces (foils) of very precise thickness and foil separation, coherence effects will modify the transition radiation&#x27;s spectral and angular characteristics. This allows a much higher number of photons to be obtained in a smaller angular &quot;volume&quot;. Applications of this x-ray source are limited by the fact that the radiation is emitted in a cone, with a minimum intensity at the center. X-ray 
focusing devices (crystals/mirrors) are not easy to build for such radiation patterns.

A special type of transition radiation is diffusive radiation. It is emitted provided that a charged particle crosses a medium with randomly inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity^{9,10,11}.

<doc id="693681" wikidata="Q328533" url="?curid=693681" title="Iejima">
<text>, previously romanized in English as Ie Shima, is an island in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, lying a few kilometers off the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island. The island measures in circumference and covers . As of December 2012 the island had a population of 4,610. Ie Village, which covers the entire island, has a ferry connection with the town of Motobu on Okinawa Island.

Iejima is generally flat. The most notable geographic feature is a peak called Mount Gusuku (or &quot;Tatchuu&quot; in Kunigami) at a height of 172 meters. The mountain resembles a volcano but is actually an erosion artifact. Alternately called &quot;Peanut Island,&quot; for its general shape and peanut crop, or &quot;Flower Island,&quot; for its abundant flora and more sizeable crop, Iejima draws tourists by ferry, especially during late April when the Ie Lily Festival begins.

== World War II ==
American troops from the 77th Infantry Division landed on Iejima in April 1945 as part of the Battle of Okinawa and there was heavy fighting from April 16 until the island was secured on April 21. U.S. journalist Ernie Pyle was killed during the battle. There is a monument dedicated to his memory on the southern part of the island. Every year on the weekend closest to his April 18 death there is a memorial service.

Iejima, which was developed in conjunction with US bases on Okinawa, became a naval advance base. Its three airstrips were under Army control, but were used by Naval Air Transport Service. The naval base included 16,700 square feet of general storage and space, 7,475 cubic feet of cold storage space and 4,500 square feet of open storage. In addition to 700 lineal feet of wharfage, there were repair shops covering 5,500 square feet; hospital, 2,400 square feet; and quarters, 67,692 square feet.
Iejima, then called &quot;Ie Shima&quot; by US military and media, was the major starting point for the Surrender of Japan. It was the home of the 413th Fighter Group which comprised the 1st, 21st and 34th Fighter Squadrons, the 345th Bombardment Group, consisting of the 498th, 499th, 500th and 501st Squadrons, along with the 548th and 549th Night Fighter Squadrons of the 7th Fighter Command. All three groups were stationed there toward the end of the war.

The surrender preparations started on August 17, 1945, with the flight of two Japanese Betty bombers to Iejima where the Japanese emissaries transferred to U.S. Army Air Force C-54s to complete their journey to Corregidor to meet with General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff. B-25 Mitchells of the 345th were assigned to escort the Japanese bombers from the Japanese mainland to Iejima, and P-38s were assigned the duty of top-cover. Japanese officials ordered the remaining Japanese Air Force to shoot down their own bombers, because they believed that honor required that Japan should fight to the very last person. Instead of flying directly to Iejima, the two Japanese planes flew northeast, toward the open ocean, to avoid their own fighters. One of the Japanese delegates aboard remarked, after looking through a bullet hole in the side of the plane, that a squadron of fighters was approaching and he thought that their surrender mission had failed. However, the squadron of fighters were U.S. P-38 Lightnings assigned as top-cover. The 345th had been directed to send two B-25s as escorts. However, fully aware of the difficulty in communication with the Japanese and correctly anticipating the possibility of necessary deviation from plans, the 345th had dispatched three flights of B-25s so as to bracket the enemy&#x27;s proposed flight path. This proved to be excellent planning, as only the second of the three flights intercepted the Japanese and the top-cover, off-course and headed on a route that would not have brought them to Iejima. Operating under orders to come no nearer than to the Japanese planes, Major J.C. McClure found it impossible to keep the Japanese on the proper course flying abreast of them, so he pulled out well ahead of them to lead their formation. Seconds later he was surprised to find the Japanese tucked in tightly under his wings. To them it was the safest way to approach the island which had only days before been their target. The four planes arrived over Iejima in perfect show formation.
The Japanese emissaries continued on to the Philippines as planned, concluded the arrangements for the formal surrender scheduled to take place on September 2 in Tokyo Bay, and returned to Iejima on August 18. As the Bettys were taxiing into place to receive their passengers for the return trip to Tokyo, one of them ran off of the runway and broke its landing gear, leaving it unable to continue the trip that day. The Japanese delegation split, with the less important delegates staying on Iejima overnight as the damaged plane was repaired, while the operable aircraft proceeded that evening. For some unexplained reason, that plane ran out of fuel some from their destination and was ditched in shallow water. The emissaries waded ashore and arrived in Tokyo the next day.

== Farmers&#x27; Movement ==
In 1955, the United States military embarked upon a wide-scale campaign to seize land from the farmers of Iejima. The campaign began in 1954 with a so-called survey project. After the island&#x27;s farmers signed the papers, they realized that in fact they had agreed to their voluntary evacuation. In 1955, the American military landed on Iejima&#x27;s southern beaches and seized the farmers&#x27; lands by force.

Following this seizure, the residents of Iejima began a five decade campaign to oppose the American military. Led by Shoko Ahagon, they traveled throughout the Okinawan islands garnering support for their campaign. This Beggars&#x27; March took the islanders all over the prefecture where they were treated hospitably by their fellow Okinawans, but when they returned to Iejima and started to farm their land once more, the American military razed their crops and arrested the islanders.

In the late 1950s, many residents of Iejima resorted to collecting scrap metal from the military bombing range. This was dangerous work resulting in the deaths or disfigurement of local men.

== Today ==
The United States military maintains a small &quot;auxiliary landing strip&quot; on Ie; this airstrip is now a military training facility run by the U.S. Marine Corps. There is a detachment of 12 US Marines which operates the range. The jobs include Operation Scheduler, Range Warden, Crash/Fire/Rescue, and Motor Transportation. The north-west corner of the island that contains a coral runway, a simulated LHD deck, and a drop zone for parachute training.

The three runways that were in use when World War II ended still exist. The center one is now abandoned and is used as a thoroughfare for the locals to get from the north to the south side of the island. The eastern one is now used by a small civilian air carrier, and the western one is still unimproved and is part of the training range. 

==Cultural references==
The island is the setting of a traditional Okinawan drama where a sad girl by the name of Hando-gwaa fell in love with a man named Kanahi, Iejima&#x27;s headman. When Hando-gwaa learned that Kanahi had already wed she climbed up to Tacchu Mountain and hanged herself with her long, black hair. One can find a statue of this woman in a garden that sits below Gusukuyama.

<doc id="693688" wikidata="Q459608" url="?curid=693688" title="Bent Pyramid">
<text>The Bent Pyramid is an ancient Egyptian pyramid located at the royal necropolis of Dahshur, approximately south of Cairo, built under the Old Kingdom King Sneferu. A unique example of early pyramid development in Egypt, this was the second of four pyramids built by Sneferu.

The Bent Pyramid rises from the desert at a 54-degree inclination, but the top section (above ) is built at the shallower angle of 43 degrees, lending the pyramid a visibly &quot;bent&quot; appearance.

== Overview ==

Archaeologists now believe that the Bent Pyramid represents a change from the step-sided pyramids of before to smooth-sided pyramids. It has been suggested that due to the steepness of the original angle of inclination the structure may have begun to show signs of instability during construction, forcing the builders to adopt a shallower angle to avert the structure&#x27;s collapse. This theory appears to be born out by the fact that the adjacent Red Pyramid, built immediately afterwards by Sneferu, was constructed at an angle of 43 degrees from its base. This fact also contradicts the theory that at the initial angle the construction would take too long because Sneferu&#x27;s death was nearing, so the builders changed the angle to complete the construction in time. In 1974, Kurt Mendelssohn suggested the change of the angle to have been made as a stability precaution in reaction to a catastrophic collapse of the Meidum Pyramid while it was still under construction.

The reason why Sneferu abandoned the Meidum Pyramid and its Step Pyramid may have been a change in ideology. The royal tomb was no longer considered as a staircase to the stars; instead, it was served as a symbol of the solar cult and of the primeval mound from which all life sprang. It is also unique among the approximately one hundred and eighteen pyramids to be found in Egypt, in that its original polished limestone outer casing remains largely intact. British structural engineer Peter James attributes this to larger clearances between the parts of the casing than used in later pyramids; these imperfections would work as expansion joints and prevent the successive destruction of the outer casing by thermal expansion. 

The ancient formal name of the Bent Pyramid is generally translated as &quot;(The)-Southern-Shining-Pyramid,&quot; or &quot;Sneferu-(is)-Shining-in-the-South&quot;. In July 2019, Egypt decided to open the Bent Pyramid for tourism for the first time since 1965. Tourists are able to reach two 4,600-year-old chambers through a narrow tunnel built from the northern entrance of the pyramid. The &quot;side pyramid&quot;, which is assumed to have been built for Sneferu&#x27;s wife Hetepheres will also be accessible. It is the first time this adjacent pyramid has been opened to the public since its excavation in 1956.

== Construction phases ==
The Pyramid underwent three construction phases. In the first construction phase, a steep pyramid with a base length of 157 meters and an inclination angle of approximately 58° (possibly even 60°) was planned. If the pyramid had been completed in this form, it would have reached a height of around 125 meters, but given the knowledge of ancient techniques and the comparison with completed pyramids, such a steep pyramid was probably not a realistic option and did not exceed only few stone layers. Due to the good overall degree of preservation of the pyramid, this phase can only be proven indirectly through offset points around 12.70 m from the entrance in the lower descending corridor and at around 11.60 meters in the upper descending corridor.
In the second phase, the builders reduced the angle of inclination to 54°. This increased the base length to 188 m. Here, too, inclined wall layers were used as in the step pyramids, because masons were not able to produce trapezoid stones at this phase. While step pyramids were built in ring-shaped shells of slant layers, the turn to undivided masonry made horizontal layers more practicable. If the inclination of 54° had been maintained, it would have reached a height of 129.4 m and a volume of around 1,524,000 cubic meters. The Bent Pyramid would therefore be the third highest pyramid in the world. However, this inclination was not continued beyond a height of 49 m. The masonry of this phase is faced with fine Tura limestone. In the third construction phase, the angle was reduced to 43° and, like in the Red Pyramid and all successive pyramids, the masonry was laid in horizontal layers. The slope reduction created the unique kink that is not found in any other pyramid. Due to the lower inclination angle of the upper part, the total height was reduced to 105 m. The total volume was 1,440,808 cubic meters. The upper area also has a cladding of fine Tura limestone.

Recent conclusions rather speak against a connection between the change in slope and structural defects. It is rather doubtful that a reduction in weight was a relevant criterion for a structure of almost closed mass. The early decision against the 60° inclination initially envisaged rather suggests that geometric aspects were the decisive factor in the gradient change. Following the assumption of tangential construction ramps inclined up to 10° as the simplest form of ramp, the fact edge lengths became smaller as the height increased made it increasingly difficult to keep the gradient low. This could be compensated for by reducing the ramp width to around 3 m, which was sufficient for pairs of train crews, but even for such narrow ramps the geometric volume could not provide enough space when the gradient was too steep. Models and abstract calculations were not possible in that time. It must therefore have become clear to the construction managers halfway up that ramp structures would not be feasible when maintaining this gradient. In fact, all completed pyramids (first the Red, then the Great Pyramid) never exceeded the maximum gradient of 53°.

==Interior passages==

The Bent Pyramid has two entrances, one fairly low down on the north side, to which a substantial wooden stairway has been built for the convenience of tourists. The second entrance is high on the west face of the pyramid. Each entrance leads to a chamber with a high, corbelled roof; the northern entrance leads to a chamber that is below ground level, the western to a chamber built in the body of the pyramid itself. A hole in the roof of the northern chamber (accessed today by a high and rickety ladder long) leads via a rough connecting passage to the passage from the western entrance.

The western entrance passage is blocked by two stone blocks which were not lowered vertically, as in other pyramids, but slid down 45° ramps to block the passage. One of these was lowered in antiquity and a hole has been cut through it, the other remains propped up by a piece of ancient cedar wood. The connecting passage referenced above enters the passage between the two portcullises.

A particular feature in the chambers are a row of original cedar beams that were interpreted by many as a reaction on structural problems. In contradiction to that, Edwards argues the cedar beams rather had been part of the funerary support structure and, some of them bedded in mortar, could not have any structural function.

==Causeway==
A causeway leads from the Bent Pyramids&#x27; northeast toward the pyramid with the valley temple. The causeway was paved with limestone blocks that went 700 meters into the pyramid&#x27;s court and had a low limestone wall on each side. For this reason of the causeway having low walls it made it so that sand would drift up it and would make it hard to enter or impossible to reenter without clearing out the sand, so there was a small bar wall that was placed with a staircase that led up into the Bent Pyramid. This lead Later for builders of the causeways to change how they were built and no longer leave the causeways open to the elements and to cover the causeways. The exit from the causeway leads into the pyramids court and was 2.80 meters wide. In fact, there may have been a second causeway that led down to a dock or landing stage, but there is no excavation that can prove this assumption yet. 

== Valley Temple ==

The valley temple of the Bent Pyramid was very different from the other valley temples know. The reason for that was it had bevelled edges, with structures that had pillars where they had decorated reliefs with exception to the front row of the temples structure that faced toward the chapel. The Valley temple is 26.20 meters wide and 47.16 meters long or 50 by 90 cubits. The Valley temple front is facing south and helps to form the northern boundary of the court. The Valley temple is divided into three sections the first and last section has a cover over it and the section between them is an open court. 

==Pyramid temple==
On the east side of the Bent Pyramid, there are the fragmentary remains of the pyramid temple. Like the pyramid temple of the Meidum Pyramid, there are two stelae behind the temple, though of these only stumps remain. There is no trace of inscription to be seen. The temple remains are fragmentary, but it is presumed to be similar to that of the Medium temple.

==Satellite pyramid==

A satellite pyramid, suggested by some Egyptologists to have been built to house the pharaoh&#x27;s &quot;ka&quot;, is located south of the Bent Pyramid. The satellite pyramid originally measured in height and in length, with faces inclining 44°30&#x27;. The structure is made of limestone blocks, relatively thick, arranged in horizontal rows and covered with a layer of fine limestone from Tura. The burial chamber is accessible from a descending corridor with its entrance located above the ground in the middle of the north face. The corridor, inclined at 34°, originally measured in length. A short horizontal passage connects the corridor with an ascending corridor, inclined at 32° 30&#x27;, leading up to the chamber.

The design of the corridors is similar to the one found in the Great Pyramid of Giza, where the Grand Gallery takes up the place of the ascending corridor. The corridor leads up to the burial chamber (called this despite that it most probably never contained any sarcophagus). The chamber, located in the center of the pyramid, has a corbel vault ceiling and contains a four metres deep shaft, probably dug by treasure hunters, in the southeast part of the chamber.

Like the main pyramid, the satellite had its own altar with two stelae located at the eastern side.

==Man-made landscape==
As the first geometrically &quot;true&quot; pyramid in the world, the Bent Pyramid is also connected to the surrounding landscape. Nicole Alexanian and Felix Arnold, two distinguished German archeologists, provided a new insight toward the meaning and function for the Bent Pyramid in their book named &quot;The complex of the Bent Pyramid as a landscape design project&quot;. They noticed that the sites of the Bent Pyramid sits aside in the middle of a pristine desert area instead of fertile area near the Nile River like all the other pyramids, and concluded the landscape surrounding the Bent Pyramid is man-made.
When the archaeologists observed the landscape closely, the plateau of the pyramid seemed leveled artificially and nearby escarpment and trenches were all made by human beings. Moreover, there were a few traces left indicating a build-up of garden enclosure. The impact of humans on the landscape is also represented by the presence of a wadi channel connecting the Bent Pyramid to a harbor, which shows a distinct difference between the southern and northern side of the channel. It shows a substantial difference in level with regards to the finding. The slope of southern wadi channel seemed to have been rectified when the archaeologists compared it to the natural and twisted northern side. Arne Ramisch supported this idea by providing evidence that displays a low correlation of fraternal patterns of channel and natural topography in the environs, which is southern side of wadi, of the Bent Pyramid.

The purpose of this man-made construction might hold mythical meaning and ritual function. Based on available evidence, garden enclosure and water basins both are the counterparts of funeral rites which indicates a regular practice of rituals at Dahshur. However, there is also the implication that the garden closure helped to create a satisfactory living environment in the desert. Other than that, the leveled plateau, the quarrying trenches on the western and southern sides of the pyramid, and the nearby smaller tombs cooperate together to emphasize the monumentality of the Bent Pyramid, aiding by its long distance from the surrounding structures. These features represent the imprinting social hierarchy in the creation of this landscape, which furthermore represents the power of Egyptian King at that time. Alexanian and Arnold describes this construction in a concise phrase: an artificial mountain erected within an artificial landscape.

== Origin of the casing stones ==
A multi-author study has shed light on the question where the material of the casing of the Bent Pyramid originated from, and whether it is dressed stone or an early form of concrete. By examining NMR spectra it was shown that these stones consist of limestone from the Tura quarries, brought across from the opposite bank of the Nile and cemented with an artificial calcium-silicate binder, probably using diatomaceous earth from Fayium. This supports the latter theory.

== Graffiti ==
The graffiti found in the Bent Pyramid&#x27;s temple was mostly in the color red in the corners of the inner parts of the Bent Pyramid temple, with some being located on the pyramids enclosure and the offering temple. The graffiti is so important to the information that we know about the tomb, because of how it is dated and showed that the graffiti and quarry marks were from the time period of Sneferu.

<doc id="693690" wikidata="Q7428008" url="?curid=693690" title="Save Manapouri campaign">
<text>The Save Manapouri campaign was an environmental campaign waged between 1969 and 1972 in New Zealand to prevent the raising of the levels of lakes Manapouri and Te Anau as part of the construction of the Manapouri Power Project.

==Origins==

The original plans for Manapouri Power Station development involved raising Lake Manapouri by up to 30 metres, and merging Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau. The Save Manapouri Campaign was launched at a public meeting at Invercargill in October 1969. It later came to manifest the international awareness of the environment that came with the prosperity of the 1960s.

:&quot;At its simplest, the issue was about whether Lake Manapouri should be raised by as much as 30 metres. But there was much more at stake than that. There were strong economic and engineering arguments opposing lake raising, and there were also legal and democratic issues underlying the whole debate. What captured the public&#x27;s imagination across the country was the prospect that a lake as beautiful as Manapouri could be interfered with, despoiled and debased&quot;, wrote Neville Peat.

In 1970, 264,907 New Zealanders, almost 10% of the population, signed the Save Manapouri petition. Nevertheless, the Cabinet Committee on Manapouri and the Manapouri Commission of Inquiry both concluded that the New Zealand Government was obligated under the terms of the Manapouri-Te Anau Development Act 1963 to raise the levels of Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau in order to guarantee the supply to Comalco (now Rio Tinto Aluminium) of electricity for the aluminium smelter based at Tiwai Point.

==Impacts==

In the 1972 general election, Manapouri was a significant issue, and the Labour Government of Norman Kirk was elected on a platform that included a strong endorsement of the Save Manapouri ideals.

In 1973, Kirk honoured his party&#x27;s election pledge. He created an independent body, the Guardians of Lake Manapouri, Monowai, and Te Anau to oversee management of the lake levels, which they do to this day. The original six &quot;Guardians&quot; were Alan Mark, Ronald McLean, Wilson Campbell, Les Hutchins, John Moore, and Jim McFarlane, and they were all prominent leaders of the Save Manapouri Campaign.

The single &quot;Damn the Dam&quot; recorded and released in 1973 by John Hanlon has retrospectively become associated with the Save Manapouri Campaign. Hanlon&#x27;s song was originally an energy conservation jingle to advertise home insulation, with the proceeds from its release going to charities. However, since the release of this song followed on from the successful conclusion of the Save Manapouri Campaign, &#x27;Damn the Dam&#x27; is now popularly recognised as an anthem in tribute to one of New Zealand&#x27;s longest and hardest-fought environmental campaigns.

In 1991, the Save Manapouri Campaign was revived with many of the same leaders and renamed &quot;Power For Our Future&quot;. The campaign opposed selling off the power station, to ensure that Comalco did not revive its plans to raise Lake Manapouri&#x27;s waters. The campaign was successful: the government announced that Manapouri would not be sold to Comalco.

<text>Leeds railway station (also known as Leeds City railway station) is the mainline railway station serving the city centre of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England. It is located on New Station Street to the south of City Square, at the foot of Park Row, behind the landmark Queens Hotel. It is one of 20 stations managed by Network Rail. As of December 2023, it was the busiest station in West Yorkshire, as well as in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber. It is the fourth busiest station in the UK outside London, after Birmingham New Street, and .

Leeds is an important hub on the British rail network. The station is the terminus of the Leeds branch of the East Coast Main Line (on which London North Eastern Railway provides high speed inter-city services to every half hour from the station) and is an important stop on the Cross Country Route between Scotland, the Midlands and South West England connecting to major towns and cities such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Derby, Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance. There are also regular inter-city services to major destinations throughout Northern England including Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield. It is also the terminus for trains running on the scenic Settle &amp; Carlisle line.

Leeds is a major hub for local and regional destinations across Yorkshire such as to Harrogate, York, Scarborough, Hull, Doncaster and Sheffield. The station lies at the heart of the West Yorkshire Metro commuter network for West Yorkshire providing services to Bradford, Wakefield, Dewsbury, Huddersfield and Halifax.

With 24 million passenger entries and exits between April 2022 and March 2023, Leeds is the busiest railway station in the North of England, overtaking , and the second-busiest railway station in the United Kingdom outside London, after .

==Description==


The railway station is situated on a hill falling from the south of the city to the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal basin. Much of it is supported on Victorian brick-vaulted arches situated just off Neville Street which contain a centre consisting of cafés, restaurants, shops and exhibition spaces called Granary Wharf, known locally as the Dark Arches.

The railway station has 18 platforms, making it the largest by number of platforms in England outside London. There are 12 terminus and six through platforms. Most platforms are subdivided into up to four sections, i.e. 1a, 1b, 1c etc. Altogether, including the numbers, there are 47 platforms. Retail facilities in the station include coffee shops, fast food outlets, a bar, newsagents, chemists and supermarkets. A British Transport Police station on New Station Street houses officers who police the West Yorkshire railway stations.

Leeds railway station retained staffed ticket barriers through the 1990s until 2008, when they were replaced by automatic barriers by Northern Rail to reduce congestion around the barriers at peak times.

===Platforms===
Platform usage varies depending on operational circumstances but is generally:
* 0–5 – bay platforms mostly used by West Yorkshire Metro services operated by Northern, towards , , and .
* 6 is a bay platform used for terminating London North Eastern Railway services from London and London North Eastern Railway services towards Harrogate.
* 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16 – through platforms. 8 is a through platform that London North Eastern Railway uses for services which both terminate and continue onward to Bradford, Harrogate and Skipton as well as the early morning LNER departure to Aberdeen. CrossCountry services heading north to York and beyond depart from platforms 8, 9 or 11; services heading south use platform 12. Platforms 15 and 16 are used by north/east and south/westbound TransPennine Express services to Hull, Newcastle, York, Scarborough, Middlesbrough, Huddersfield, Manchester Airport and Liverpool Lime Street.
* 7, 14 – bay platforms used for local Northern services running north/east from Leeds.
* 10, 13, 17 – bay platforms used for local and regional services running south/west to Manchester Victoria and Huddersfield, alongside southbound services towards Wakefield, Barnsley, Meadowhall, Sheffield and Nottingham.

==Transport links==

Leeds Interchange, located at the New Station Street exit, provides onward transport connections from the station. There are five bus stands serving Arriva Yorkshire, First West Yorkshire and Flyer routes 1, 4, 4F, 5, 14, 16, 16A, 19, 19A, 40, 444, 446, 870, A1 and DalesBus services 874 and 875. A 24-hour taxi rank also operates at the interchange.

Further bus stops are located on Neville Street below the railway station, as well as around City Square outside the railway station. Infirmary Street and Boar Lane bus points are a short walk for more bus connections.

===Cycle hub===
Leeds Interchange hosts one of the UK&#x27;s first cycle hubs that allows a number of cycling services including repair, storage and rental. The facility opened in summer 2010 and is designed to encourage visitors and commuters into Leeds to continue their journey from the railway station by bike. Its design is based on the Dutch cyclepoint concept.

==History==
===Past railway stations===


The railways arrived in Leeds in 1834, when the Leeds and Selby Railway (which became part of the North Eastern Railway) opened its line. It had a terminus at Marsh Lane east of the city centre. In 1840, the North Midland Railway (a constituent of the Midland Railway) constructed its line from Derby via Rotherham to a terminus at Hunslet Lane to the south. It was extended to a more centrally located terminus at Wellington Street in 1846, known as &quot;Wellington Station&quot;.

Another railway station, Leeds Central on Wellington Street, was opened in 1854 by the Manchester and Leeds Railway and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The railway station became owned jointly by the LNWR and the North Eastern Railway, but other companies had powers to run trains there, including the Great Northern Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

In 1869, &quot;New Station&quot; opened as a joint enterprise by the LNWR and the North Eastern Railway. It connected the former Leeds and Selby Railway Line to the east with the LNWR lines to the west. A mile-long connection was built, carried entirely on viaducts and bridges. New Station was built partially on a bridge over the River Aire, adjacent to Wellington railway station. The arches created under the station are known as &#x27;The Dark Arches&#x27;.

The map to the right shows the variety of different railway lines in Leeds in 1913.

Following the Railways Act 1921, when railways in Great Britain were grouped into four companies, New Station was jointly operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).

===1938 rebuilding===

The first rationalisation occurred in 1938, when two railway stations (New and Wellington) were combined to form &quot;Leeds City Station&quot;, opening on 2 May that year. This was designed by LMS architect William Henry Hamlyn. The third railway station, Leeds Central, was unaffected by the change. Part of Wellington railway station later became a parcels depot. The north concourse and the Queens Hotel were built at this time.

===Leeds Blitz===
In March 1941, the Luftwaffe launched attacks on Leeds, Armley, Beeston and Bramley. Leeds New Station was one of the primary targets, along with the Town Hall, Kirkgate Markets, the Central Post office, the Quarry Hill flats, Hotel Metropole and part of the Inner Ring Road. The station was bombed, causing damage and an unknown number of casualties, and was later rebuilt.

The Transport Act 1947 nationalised nearly all forms of mass transport in Great Britain and came into effect on 1 January 1948. British Railways came into existence as the business name of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC) on 1 January 1948.

===1962 British Railways House===

In 1962, British Railways House, now City House, was added to the railway station. It was designed by architect John Poulson providing British Railways with administrative buildings. The building became dated and hard to let before refurbishment in 2009. The building was lambasted in 1967 by poet John Betjeman who said it blocked all the light out of City Square, and was a testament to money with no architectural merit. In 2010 the building was bought by property company Bruntwood which is (as of 2017) redeveloping it to provide serviced offices, with a new look to the façade.

===1967 rebuilding===
In 1967, further remodelling of the site took place and trains using Central Railway Station were diverted into the City Railway Station which became the main railway station serving the city. Central Railway Station was closed and has been demolished. The viaduct leading to Central Railway Station is one of many disused viaducts near Leeds Railway Station. Engineering work included replacing 100-year-old bridges over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the construction of the south concourse and an overall roof, along with major platform and track layout alterations and the commissioning of a new power signal box to control the railway station area.

At the time of this rebuilding, the railway station was served by 500 trains on a typical day, with 2.75 million passenger journeys a year. Wellington (or City North) became entirely devoted to parcels traffic at this time with the track layout extensively changed. The remaining Midland line trains which previously used City North station were diverted into the City South station, the former LNWR/NER &#x27;New&#x27; station, and called simply Leeds from this time.

===Electrification===
The station had overhead electrification installed under the ownership of British Rail in 1988, to facilitate usage of the new Class 91 services on the East Coast main line.

===2002 rebuilding===
By the 1990s, the railway station&#x27;s capacity was exceeded on a daily basis, and the 1967 design was deemed inadequate. Between 1999 and 2002, a major rebuilding project took place, branded as &quot;Leeds 1st&quot;. This project saw the construction of additional approach tracks at the western end of the railway station, improving efficiency by separating trains travelling to or from different destinations and preventing them from having to cross each other&#x27;s routes. The railway station was expanded from 12 to 17 platforms, with the construction of new platforms on the south side, and reopening of the disused parcels depot to passengers on the north side.

The majority of the track, points and signals were also replaced and the 1967 power box closed – control being handed over to the signalling centre at . The most visible change to passengers, however, was the replacement of the 1967 metal canopy with a new glass roof, considerably increasing the amount of daylight on the platforms. A new footbridge was also provided, replacing the previous underpass. Ancillary improvements included a new multi-storey car park and railway station entrance, refurbishing the North Concourse and expanding retail facilities.

A small temporary railway station called Leeds Whitehall was provided to handle some services while the railway station was being remodelled. This was used between September 1999 and February 2002.

===2008 work===
In 2008, automated ticket gates were installed in place of the human-controlled ticket checking, to speed up the passage of passengers. When the gates came into operation at the end of October 2008, they suffered from several faults including accepting expired tickets. An oversight on the part of Northern also meant that the gates were not compatible with West Yorkshire Metro Cards.

===Southern entrance===
A £17.3 million southern entrance to allow for easier access from the south completed on 3 January 2016. It widens the railway station&#x27;s western footbridge and provides escalators, stairs and lifts to a partial deck over the River Aire in an iconic structure. The deck provides access to either side of the river for passengers to access Granary Wharf and Little Neville Street or Holbeck. It contains extra ticket vending machines and cycle storage. Around 20% of passengers are expected to use the new entrance.

===South concourse and platform zero===
Work on a new terminal platform alongside platform 1 (labelled platform 0) began in late 2018 and was completed in January 2021.

In November 2018 Network Rail began work to improve the south concourse. The first phase of works aimed to reduce congestion by moving and expanding ticket barriers. A new transparent roof was installed, matching the design at the Southern entrance, with works completed in October 2019.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 13 January 1892, a fire broke out in the arches underneath the station carrying the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The fire burnt for two days, with the heat buckling the rails and causing significant damage to the permanent way. One person died when a platform collapsed underneath him.
* On 23 July 1993, a passenger train ran into the rear of another occupying a platform. Twenty-one people were injured.
* On 17 April 1997 a small bomb planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army exploded at a relay cabinet near the station, causing the city centre&#x27;s closure for six hours.

==Future==

Leeds railway station is the second-busiest railway station outside London in the United Kingdom, and passenger numbers are expected to increase by 63% between 2014 and 2029, meaning further expansion is necessary. Future expansion might link the station to the proposed High Speed 2 network.

===Future remodelling===
In October 2017, it was proposed that the station could be remodelled for the proposed HS2 scheme. The proposal includes new platforms on the north side of Leeds as well as HS2 services running into the existing east–west platforms as well as the proposed terminal platforms allowing links to proposed &#x27;Northern Powerhouse Rail&#x27;. In November 2017, details were released about how the station might look.

===Expansion===
Plans are being drawn up to expand the railway station&#x27;s capacity with new lines and platforms alongside platform one in the Riverside Car Park on the site of the original Leeds Wellington railway station to cater for predicted growth. Also Metro announced plans to replace platform 1 with three separate platforms using the car park next to it. This would increase platform numbers from 17 to 20.

===HS2 platforms===

The original plans for High Speed 2 proposed a separate new station in Leeds to the south of the River Aire at New Lane. However, a later review in November 2015 instead recommends that HS2 platforms be added to the existing station. These would attach to the southern part of the existing station building, and span the river in a north–south alignment to create a &#x27;T&#x27; shape.

This would not link the high speed and classic rail services, but it would allow a common concourse for easy interchange between them. These plans were approved by the Government in November 2016.

However, on 18 November 2021, Grant Shapps (Transport Secretary) announced that the eastern leg of HS2 would be cancelled, terminating at East Midlands Parkway instead of going all the way to Leeds. Eventually, the leg reaching East Midlands Parkway was scrapped too, with no new track north of Birmingham Curzon Street.

==Services==
The railway station is served by long-distance services operated by CrossCountry, London North Eastern Railway and TransPennine Express, as well as suburban services under the West Yorkshire MetroTrain brand and commuter and inter-city services operated by Northern. It is the hub of the Metro network in West Yorkshire. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) and trains per day (tpd) is

==Former services==
East Midlands Railway (EMR) and its predecessors operated a number of services to and from London St Pancras via the Midland Main Line until May 2022. Two evening northbound and two morning southbound services operated primarily to cycle InterCity 125 sets through Neville Hill TMD. After EMR withdrew its last InterCity 125 sets in May 2021, the service was reduced to a single northbound service operated by a Class 222. It was withdrawn in May 2022.

<doc id="693707" wikidata="Q457141" url="?curid=693707" title="Gotse Delchev, Blagoevgrad Province">
<text>Gotse Delchev ( ), is a town in Gotse Delchev Municipality in Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria.

In 1951, the town was renamed after the revolutionary leader Gotse Delchev. It had hitherto been called Nevrokop (in , ; in ; and in ).

Nearby are the remains of a walled city established by the Romans in the 2nd century AD. The town was a kaza in the Siroz sanjak of the Salonica vilayet before the Balkan Wars.

==Geography==
Gotse Delchev is situated in a mountainous area, about from the capital Sofia and from the city of Blagoevgrad in the southern part of Blagoevgrad district. The town center is above sea level. The Gotse Delchev Hollow is characterized by a continental climate; rainfall occurs mainly during spring and autumn, and summers are hot and dry. Winter temperature inversions are possible.

==History==
===Antiquity and medieval period===
Nicopolis ad Nestum was one of two fortified towns founded to mark Emperor Trajan&#x27;s victory in 105-106 AD over the Dacians. The area had been inhabited for about 14 centuries and attained its peak in late antiquity (4th-6th centuries AD). The original town occupied about 25–30 decаres. The Slavs destroyed Nicopolis in the 6th-7th centuries but it re-emerged as a medieval settlement in the late 10th century.

===Ottoman period===
Nevrokop became part of the Ottoman Empire sometime between 1374 and 1383, when the Ottoman Turks captured Serres and Drama. The town was included in the Ottoman documents sometime after the final conquest of Thessaloniki by the Ottoman Empire in 1430. Under the name Nevrokop, the town is mentioned in the Ottoman Tahrir defter Mal. No. 525 from 1444, in which it was described as a large Christian village – center of ziamet, numbering 131 households, 12 singles and 24 widows. Thus, Nevrokop was the largest settlement in the region. Then, Nevrokop developed very quickly and became a Muslim city. Ottoman tax registers from 1464 to 1465 mark 208 Christian households, 50 singles and 19 widows, and 12 Muslim households. During the 1478–1479 registration year, Nevrekop recorded 393 Christian households, 31 widows, and 42 Muslim households.

In the 1480s, a large domed mosque and Islamic school were founded in Nevrokop by Mehmed Bey, son of Karadja Pasha. This mosque is the only Ottoman architectural monument in the city that survives to this day. In 1512, Koja Mustafa Pasha founded a second mosque, a bath, and a second school. In 1519 (Hijri 925), the town of Nevrekop had 167 Muslim households and 124 unmarried Muslim men and 319 Christian households and 26 unmarried Christian men, and it was a zeamet of Şah Hüseyin Bey kethudâ of Kara Hamid.
In 1565, Sultan Suleiman I issued a decree for the construction of a mosque to commemorate his son Şehzade Mehmed.

In the 17th century, there was a decline in the growth of the city. Hadji Kalfa mentioned Nevrokop as a judicial center and noted the presence of mines around the town, with rich deposits of iron ore. In the official list of the judicial centers, 1667–1668, Nevrokop ranks fourth among the twelve judicial centers in Rumelia, which shows its importance as a town. The most detailed description of Nevrokop in Ottoman times is given in Volume VII of the Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi. He describes the city as being large, with many mosques, twelve minarets, tekkes for dervishes, inns, hammams, schools, and many beautiful houses and residences of numerous provincial administrations.

Nevrokop in the Ottoman times became a center of cultural life. Among famous artists born in the city are Rana Mustafa Efendi Nakshbendi – in service to Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Nakshbendi died in 1832 in his hometown of Nevrokop. He is likely to have inspired the last Nevrokop mosque, which closely resembled the buildings erected by Muhammad Ali in Kavala in 1818–1821. Zyuhri Ahmed Effendi, the founder of the religious current &quot;zyuhrie&quot;, was also born in Nevrokop. He died in Thessaloniki in 1751 and was buried in the tekke, which he had built during his lifetime.

A. Sinve, in his work &quot;Les Grecs de l&#x27;Empire Ottoman. Etude Statistique et Ethnographique&quot;, which is based on Greek data, wrote in 1878 that in Nevrekop (Névrékop), there lived 1,200 Greeks. In 1889, Stefan Verkovich notes Nevrokop as a city with 209 Bulgarian, 1,675 Turkish, and 38 Aromanian houses.

===Bulgarian Renaissance===
In the 19th century, along with agriculture, husbandry, and beekeeping, the town of Gotse Delchev developed coppersmithing and goldsmithing crafts, packsaddle manufacturing, homespun, leather, and timber trades. Local traders carried goods to sell at fairs in Serres, Drama, Melnik, and Uzundzhovo. Since the second half of the 19th century, every year in August the Nevrokop Fair was held, which attracted merchants from the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, France, and other countries.

In 1808–1811, the Christian community in the town built a small church dedicated to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. During the years 1833–1841, they built a large church to the Holy Virgin Mary, which is a result of reforms in the Empire.

The Bulgarian population of Nevrokop stood against the Greek clergy for church independence and early Bulgarian education. In 1862, the town had its first Bulgarian school, with the first teacher being Todor Nenov, and in 1867, a school for girls was opened. The Greek Orthodox Bishop Agathangel allowed the use of half the urban school for Bulgarian classes, but after protests by Greeks and Vlachs, the Bulgarian school was closed and Nenov expelled. Bulgarians in the city threatened communion with the Pope, and the bishop reopened the Bulgarian school. In 1865, a community center was opened and in 1870, a female community. In 1873, a teachers&#x27; community, called &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, was formed, which played an important role in the struggles of the Bulgarians. The Bulgarian communities in Plovdiv and Pazardzhik had a positive impact on the cultural revival of Nevrokop: they assisted with teachers, teaching materials, books, and money.

After the Russo-Turkish War in 1877–1878 and the Berlin Congress of 1878, Nevrokop remained within the Ottoman Empire (as did the whole of Macedonia). The divided Bulgarian lands became the arena of the process of national unification. In May 1878, representatives of the Bulgarian community in Nevrokop signed the &quot;Memorandum of the Bulgarian church and school communities in Macedonia&quot;, stating that they wanted to join Macedonia in the newly formed Bulgarian state.
According to geographers Dimitri Mishev and D. M. Brancoff, the town had a population of 1,646 Christians in 1905, consisting of 1,016 Exarchist Bulgarians, 288 Patriarchist Bulgarians, 168 Vlachs, 114 Roma people, and 60 Greeks. The city operated one elementary and one lower-secondary Bulgarian school with 6 teachers and 151 students, and two Greek schools starting with 6 teachers and 77 students.

===Nevrokop in the Kingdom of Bulgaria===
The town became part of Bulgaria after the First Balkan War of 19 October 1912. The first mayor of the city after the liberation was the poet Peyo Yavorov. The inclusion of the area within the Kingdom of Bulgaria led to a mass exodus of Muslims from the town and to a lesser extent, from the villages. In their place settled Bulgarian refugees from the regions of Serres and Drama, whose homelands fell under the rule of Greece. The census of 1926 clearly noted the changes. At that time in Nevrokop there were only 1,057 Turks, while Bulgarians numbered 5,882. The census of 1934 showed this trend continuing – 824 Turks and 7,726 Bulgarians were counted.

After the liberation of the city from Ottoman rule, Nevrokop began a slow process of resettlement of refugees from Aegean Macedonia in the years between the Balkan Wars and the First World War, which changed the whole look of the city. Late Baroque Bulgarian houses were built in the central part of the town, and this architecture has been preserved ever since.

In 1922, forces of the Macedonian Federative Organization with the support of the Bulgarian government attacked the IMRO local detachments. As result of this unrest, on 17 October, Nevrokop was occupied by IMRO forces, who banished the Federalists, but with no further serious consequences. In the years of the Bulgarian resistance movement during World War II, a formation led by Aneshti Uzunov operated in the region. After his death in 1943, it was named after him. On 11 September 1944, the Partisans from that formation came from Garmen and took control of the area.

===1944–1989===
After the Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état of 1944, the newly established government started a major persecution of people who were in any way affiliated to the former fascist government and its local authorities. Many people were arrested and some of them were executed without legal process; others were sentenced to death by the special People&#x27;s Court. Many of the detainees were imprisoned for life or given different terms. Some of the accused were declared &quot;missing&quot; and never reappeared. Thus, many supporters or members of IMRO were persecuted. Many of them fled abroad.

In 1951, Nevrokop was renamed after the revolutionary Gotse Delchev.

In the following years, agriculture remained the main source of income due to the fertility of arable land and the favorable climate in the Gotse Delchev hollow. Cooperative farming was enforced, and after 1971, the land was fully nationalized. Food, wood, and tobacco processing industries were developed, and most of the yield from the area was processed there. Plants for FM radio transmitters, parts for tower cranes, plastic goods, zippers, and clothing were also built.

The road system of the region suffered from lack of repair, and improvement and transportation became long and expensive. Railroad were never planned or built. Distances from Blagoevgrad and Sofia and the difficult roads in the winter led to further isolation of Gotse Delchev. The closed border with Greece and the special admission controls contributed to this process. The town lost its previous importance and even the seat of the Nevrokop Metropolitan Orthodox bishop was transferred to Blagoevgrad.

===1989–present===
After the change of political system in 1989, the restitution of property, and the privatization of state-owned industries, the economy of Gotse Delchev became reshaped, especially in the area of agriculture. Most of the assets of mechanized farming were lost. Arable land was divided into small pieces, much of which went uncultivated and became deserted. Some industrial projects were closed or worked at a minimal rate. In recent years, heavier industries were abandoned, but light industries and processing factories have bloomed. After the opening of a new border crossing point between Gotse Delchev and Drama, Greece in 2005, the town gained new importance. Roads leading to the region have been repaired and improved.

==Economy==
===Industry and trade===
The municipality has been isolated from big industrial centers in Bulgaria due to its geographic location near the closed border with Greece for about sixty years, and the lack of natural resources, the long distances between Gotse Delchev and other bigger towns, and the narrow and poorly maintained roads have contributed to this as well. After the opening of the Ilinden–Exochi border crossing and improvement of the road system in the area, the economy of the municipality has changed. Light industries are well presented in the town of Gotse Delchev. Textile and shoe industries, zipper production, plastics processing, paper and wood processing, and tobacco growing and processing are major sources of income in the municipality. There are no big department stores, but a wide variety of smaller shops exist in the town.

===Agriculture, forestry, and stock-breeding===
The Mediterranean influence in the wide valley of the Mesta river is favorable for modern and productive agriculture. Tobacco was the most important crop in earlier years, representing a large part of the region&#x27;s agriculture; however, the worldwide decline in smoking and a change in the state policy of subsidies for tobacco production have caused tobacco farming to decrease. People also grow wheat, maize for grain, beans, sunflowers, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, apples, grapes, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and other fruits.

===Transportation and infrastructure===
The only transportation available in the town is by automobile. Most of the streets are paved. Buses connect the town with Sofia, Blagoevgrad, and the villages in Gotse Delchev municipality, as well as Garmen and Hadzhidimovo municipalities. Multiple cellphone operators cover the town; there are also landline telephones, internet, and cable TV. Electricity and water supply utilities cover the whole town.

==Administration and politics==
Gotse Delchev, the town, is the administrative centre of Gotse Delchev Municipality, part of Blagoevgrad Province, which includes the following places:

Nevrokop Vocational School (NPG) &quot;Dimitar Talev&quot; was founded in 1965 as a vocational-technical school in electro-technology. Over the years, the school grew into the School of Electrical Engineering, which provided primary staff to factories. After the democratic changes of 1989 and the subsequent closure of the plant, the school was restructured into a modern high school.
* Professional machinery high school &quot;Peyo Yavorov&quot;
Widely known as the Professional School of Agricultural Mechanization, &quot;P. Yavorov&quot; is the successor to the original agricultural school in Gotse Delchev, which was opened in 1929 with of farmland. The school went through many changes over the years.

During the month of July 1959, an agricultural school was opened with the following specialties: tobacco, wine, horticulture, and animal husbandry; it was housed in the primary school. The first class included 105 students from across the country.

In 1963, the school was given of farmland, and a tractor. During the academic year 1968–1969, the school was transformed into a practical agricultural school. From the academic year 1974–1975, the school grew into a vocational technical school, specializing in mechanization of agriculture. In 1983, the school moved to a new building, and in 2003 it was renamed Vocational School for Mechanization of Agriculture.

==Health care==
Health care in the town is relatively well organized. There is municipal hospital &quot;Dr Ivan Skenderov,&quot; which provides hospital treatment for patients from the region. The hospital has ten departments: internal medicine with cardiology unit, surgery, oto-rhino-laryngology with ophthalmology unit, trauma and orthopedics, pediatrics, neurology, nephrology with dialysis unit, obstetrics with neonatal care unit, intensive care, and infectious diseases.

In 2001, the Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany opened a private hospital, &quot;Symbol of Hope,&quot; for endocrine diseases, with the intention to provide affordable health services for poor people. But, after several years, the hospital closed. In 2011, the hospital reopened with different specialties: vascular surgery, orthopedics and trauma care, and mobile home care.

Two medical centers with different specialists and several general practitioners provide primary health care. There are also several dental clinics, which provide both modern and traditional services.

<doc id="693710" wikidata="Q4958553" url="?curid=693710" title="Brayer">
<text>A brayer is a hand-tool used historically in printing and printmaking to break up and &quot;rub out&quot; (spread) ink, before it was &quot;beaten&quot; using inking balls or composition rollers. A brayer consists of a short wooden cylinder with a handle fitted to one end; the other, flat end is used to rub the ink. 

==History==
The word is derived from the verb to &quot;bray&quot;, meaning &quot;to break, pound, or grind small, as in a mortar&quot;.

In the late nineteenth century the term was applied in the United States to a small hand-roller, &quot;used for spreading ink on the inking table, and for applying it to the distributing plates or rollers connected with presses&quot;. Such small rollers were sold as &quot;brayers&quot; from at least 1912 and later in the century the term was applied in the U.S. to hand-rollers of all sorts and sizes. It retains its original meaning in Europe.

==Materials==

Brayers in the original sense were generally made of wood (though Southward refers to their being made of &quot;wood or glass&quot;). Later, rollers could be made of composition, vulcanized rubber, sponge, acrylic, polyurethane or leather. They are formed around a shaft or core and often attached to a wooden handle. Some rollers have an all-metal support, while larger examples may have two handles to allow for two-handed use (to allow the heavy roller to be controlled and in some cases to apply additional pressure).

==Process==
The printer uses an ink knife to lay out a &quot;pad&quot;, mound or streak of ink on a smooth inking plate, originally made of polished metal or stone. The ink is then rubbed with the brayer until an area is smooth enough to beat with the ink balls or roller. In contemporary printmaking, commercially-available inks are often smooth and soft enough that they do not require braying before they can be rolled (and thus a more-fragile glass sheet may be used as an inking plate). The roller is passed systematically across the surface to produce an even layer of ink. The roller is then applied to the forme, block, stone or plate so that the ink is evenly transferred to the raised or receptive areas before the next stage of transferring the ink, by moderate pressure, to the printing surface or offset substrate.

==Uses==
Brayers are rarely used in contemporary printing and printmaking to break up and spread ink, except in cases of historical reconstruction or when a printer has made their own ink and it is too thick to spread without the use of a brayer. Rollers are primarily used for relief printing, leather rollers almost exclusively in lithography and sponge rollers are used only for paint, scrapbooking and other craft applications.

<doc id="693711" wikidata="Q845846" url="?curid=693711" title="The Strat">
<text>The Strat (formerly the Stratosphere) is a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. It includes a observation tower, the tallest in the United States. It is also the second-tallest observation tower in the Western Hemisphere, surpassed only by the CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario. The top of the tower includes a revolving restaurant, lounges, observation decks, and several thrill rides. The hotel and casino are at the base of the tower, and the resort also includes a showroom and a shopping mall. The Strat is within city limits on Las Vegas Boulevard, just north of the Las Vegas Strip. The resort is sometimes considered a Strip property, but Clark County does not officially recognize it as such, saying the Strip does not extend into the city.

Part of the property was previously occupied by Vegas World, a hotel and casino Bob Stupak opened in 1979. A decade after its opening, Stupak announced plans for a giant neon sign for Vegas World, to be built on adjacent property. The idea soon evolved into an observation tower with a rooftop restaurant. Construction of the Stratosphere Tower began in 1992. A fire of unknown origin occurred on the tower in August 1993, during construction. Stupak then had difficulty acquiring funds to finish the tower. To complete the project, he partnered with Grand Casinos, owned by his poker friend Lyle Berman.

The tower was originally proposed with a height of . But in 1994, Stupak considered extending the height to , seeking the title of tallest free-standing structure in the world. The Federal Aviation Administration opposed the new height, and the city ultimately rejected it, but allowed Stupak to go as high as . Vegas World closed on February 1, 1995, and its hotel towers were remodeled to serve as the hotel for the Stratosphere. New hotel towers were built to accompany the existing buildings. The observation tower, which cost $70 million to build, was topped off on November 4, 1995.

The $550 million Stratosphere complex opened on April 30, 1996. Parts of the resort were unfinished at the time, including a hotel tower and sections of the shopping mall. The Stratosphere was built in a crime-ridden neighborhood known as Naked City. The resort struggled financially during its first year for a number of reasons, including its location away from the Strip and other resorts. Marketing was also limited, as Berman initially believed the tower had generated enough publicity on its own. The unfinished facilities were another factor in the resort&#x27;s low revenue.

Stratosphere Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1997, and businessman Carl Icahn purchased the resort in 1998. Icahn had the remaining hotel rooms finished in 2001 as part of a $65 million renovation project. The resort became profitable under his ownership by targeting value-conscious visitors. In 2004, ownership was transferred to Icahn&#x27;s company, American Casino &amp; Entertainment Properties (ACEP). Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds purchased ACEP and the Stratosphere in 2008. Two years later, ACEP carried out a $20 million renovation that included remodeling the hotel rooms. Other renovations continued into 2012. Golden Entertainment purchased ACEP and the Stratosphere in 2017, and additional renovations began in 2018, continuing into 2020. The resort was rebranded as The Strat on January 22, 2020.

==History==

In 1974, Bob Stupak opened a small casino in Las Vegas known as Bob Stupak&#x27;s World Famous Million-Dollar Historic Gambling Museum and Casino, north of the Las Vegas Strip on land previously occupied by the Todkill/Bill Hayden Lincoln Mercury Dealership. The casino burned down two months later, and Stupak opened his Vegas World hotel and casino on the same property in 1979.

===Conception===
Stupak&#x27;s concept for the Stratosphere began as a plan to construct a neon sign tower for Vegas World. In October 1989, Stupak submitted plans to the city for the approval of the neon sign tower, which would stand four times taller than the hotel. A few days later, he withdrew his plans to allow time for a revised version of the tower that would include an elevator leading up to an observation deck. Stupak, who wanted the tower to become a local landmark, said, &quot;What I&#x27;m trying to do for Las Vegas is what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, what the Empire State Building did for New York, what the Seattle Space Needle did for Seattle.&quot; Stupak&#x27;s plans received widespread opposition, including from Las Vegas city staff, who drafted an ordinance that would have limited signs to 35 feet. The Las Vegas City Council rejected the ordinance, considering it a poorly drawn measure aimed specifically at stopping Stupak&#x27;s project.
In February 1990, Stupak unveiled his revised plans for a $50 million, observation tower with a top floor that would include a revolving restaurant and four penthouse suites. It would be the tallest structure in Las Vegas and in Nevada. The tower was designed by architect Ned Baldwin, who also worked on the CN Tower in Toronto. Stupak&#x27;s vision for the project was inspired by the Sydney Tower in Australia, where he once lived. In April 1990, the city council approved Stupak&#x27;s tower, despite objections from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which said it was too tall. Nellis Air Force Base also opposed the tower. Stupak later said that &quot;all sorts of people out there opposed&quot; the tower, adding, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for the courage of the council, it would have never been built.&quot; Critics later called the project the &quot;eighth blunder of the world&quot; and &quot;Stupak&#x27;s shaft.&quot;

In October 1991, the city approved the tower&#x27;s base and shaft; the pod atop the tower had yet to be approved. At the time, Stupak was trying to obtain financing for the now-$100 million project and was also under investigation by gaming officials over allegations that he used deceptive advertising to lure customers to Vegas World. The project was now planned to include the &quot;world&#x27;s first indoor African lion&#x27;s park&quot;, consisting of a jungle habitat at the tower base; this feature was eventually scrapped.

Groundbreaking for the project, known as the Stratosphere Tower, took place on November 5, 1991. The start of construction had yet to be announced for the tower, which was still opposed by the FAA.

===Construction===
Construction of the $32 million tower began in February 1992, on property adjacent to Vegas World. Multiple architectural and engineering firms monitored the construction to ensure structural integrity. The tower was built directly north of the Las Vegas Strip and south of downtown Las Vegas, in an area known as Meadows Village, a crime-ridden neighborhood nicknamed Naked City. Shortly before its opening, a Stratosphere spokesman said, &quot;We hope Stratosphere will be the catalyst that spurs redevelopment&quot; in the area, while acknowledging, &quot;We plunked down a half-billion-dollar project in the middle of one of the worst neighborhoods.&quot;

On August 29, 1993, around midnight, hundreds of customers at Vegas World were evacuated when the half-finished tower caught on fire. No one was hurt. The cause of the fire was never determined. Parts of the tower were blackened, but the fire caused no structural damage. The tower is made of concrete and steel. The fire delayed the opening, which had been planned for August 1994, by eight weeks. Stupak said the tower&#x27;s first phase would still be ready in time with an accelerated construction schedule. A large crane atop the tower, used for construction, was also damaged in the fire. The next month, high winds prevented the scheduled dismantling of the crane, a process expected to take two days.
After the fire, Stupak had trouble financing the completion of the tower. To continue construction, Grand Casinos announced plans in November 1993 to purchase 33% of the Stratosphere and Vegas World by acquiring shares in Stupak&#x27;s Stratosphere Corporation. Grand Casinos, owned by Stupak&#x27;s poker friend Lyle Berman, ultimately purchased a 43% stake in the resort.

As construction continued in April 1994, the tower was over tall. That month, Stupak announced that he was considering an extension of the tower&#x27;s height, which would bring it to , beating the CN Tower by and making the Stratosphere the tallest structure in the world. This new height was opposed by the FAA, the Airline Pilots Association, and McCarran International Airport, on the grounds that it would force changes in air traffic patterns. The FAA said the tower would be an aviation hazard, but its developers argued that the height would make it a major tourist attraction.

Stupak and Grand Casinos developed a laser light show for the tower in case the city rejected the new height. A lawyer for the project said, &quot;If we can&#x27;t have the world&#x27;s tallest tower, we&#x27;ll have the world&#x27;s most beautiful tower.&quot; The FAA also opposed the laser show, citing previous incidents around the country in which pilots were temporarily blinded by laser lights. In June 1994, the city rejected Stupak&#x27;s new height proposal but allowed him to go up to , higher than the he had originally proposed. The tower was ultimately built out to the city&#x27;s maximum height, though the FAA still considered it a hazard.
Grand Casinos completed its purchase of Vegas World at the end of 1994, and the hotel-casino closed on February 1, 1995, for remodeling to be integrated into the resort. Vegas World&#x27;s two hotel towers, consisting of 932 rooms, were renovated to become part of the Stratosphere. A month after the closure, Stratosphere Corporation began selling bonds worth $203 million. The company hoped to raise money to finish the tower and pay Stupak the $50.8 million purchase price for Vegas World. Stupak&#x27;s critics did not believe he could complete the tower, in part because of his controversial promotional tactics at Vegas World. Critics had also believed that completion would be unlikely after the 1993 fire and the FAA&#x27;s opposition. After a 1995 motorcycle accident left Stupak in a coma for 12 days, he said the controversy and &quot;all the complaining&quot; about the tower stopped: &quot;There were people who didn&#x27;t like the tower, this and that, but after the accident, it was like nobody had anything negative to say about it.&quot;

During 1994, crews erected a crane—taller than the earlier one—that allowed them to continue work on the tower. The 75-ton crane was tall and was installed over four days. Removal of the crane began in October 1995, with the use of a second crane. Dismantling the crane was one of the most significant challenges for those working on the tower. The tower pod&#x27;s unique design and its limited space required construction crews to carefully plan the installation of the second crane, which weighed 30 tons. The second crane lowered pieces of the original crane to the ground, and then lifted a seven-ton derrick into place, allowing workers to carry down sections of the second crane. The derrick was then disassembled by hand, and workers used a construction elevator to bring down the pieces. The complex and risky process was expected to take nearly two months. The tower was topped off with a ceremony on November 4, 1995. A helicopter was used to lift two steel frames to the top. Six workers, strapped to the tower, helped guide the final sections into place.

Years before the Stratosphere&#x27;s opening, a three-block neighborhood of houses in Meadows Village was demolished to make room for the resort&#x27;s 4,500-space parking garage. In 1994, officials from the Stratosphere project—north of the Aztec Inn motel-casino—agreed with the city&#x27;s Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency to have the Aztec Inn&#x27;s parking lot condemned through eminent domain and turned over to the Stratosphere. The Aztec Inn opposed the agreement, and in 1995 a judge ruled it unconstitutional. By April 1996, the Aztec Inn settled with the Stratosphere and agreed to sell its parking lot.

Separately, the Stratosphere agreed to provide free rent and relocation expenses to approximately 140 residents in a nearby area of Meadows Village that was cleared for an eventual expansion of the resort. An additional hotel tower had been planned for the land, directly north of the resort; were already occupied by several businesses, and this portion of the land was to be seized through eminent domain, but three property owners fought the seizure in a court battle that lasted into the next decade. The proposed expansion never took place.

===Opening===
The Stratosphere was expected to employ 3,000 people, and began hiring for the remaining 2,400 employees in March 1996, a month before the opening. At the time, Stupak was the chairman of Stratosphere Corporation and owned 17% of the company. He was one of the corporation&#x27;s nine directors, and would not oversee the company&#x27;s daily operations.

Shortly before its opening, several daredevils expressed interest in performing stunts from the top of the tower, but they were declined for safety reasons. Smoke in the tower&#x27;s pod restaurant forced an evacuation of workers on April 25, 1996, days before the opening. The smoke came from the pod&#x27;s fifth-floor kitchen, one floor above the restaurant, due to a faulty ventilator in the air-flow duct system. The pod contained four tanks with 32,000 gallons of water for firefighters in the event of a fire, but they were not needed.

A film crew followed Stupak all day leading up to the opening. More than 8,000 VIP guests visited the resort for a premiere party on April 29, hours before its midnight opening. Stupak attended the event with singer Phyllis McGuire. Other attendees included Nevada governor Bob Miller and Las Vegas mayor Jan Laverty Jones. Media from around the world attended the event, which was broadcast live by CNBC as well as television stations in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. A six-minute fireworks show, costing $50,000, began at 10:30 p.m. Doors in the tower&#x27;s pod had been left partially open to accommodate television camera cables, and smoke from the fireworks filled the pod and set off fire alarms, resulting in the shutdown of elevators and stranding hundreds of VIP guests.

The $550 million complex featured , including of entertainment and shopping space. A casino was part of the resort&#x27;s first phase, which also included 1,500 hotel rooms. The hotel was expected to open on May 7. Another 1,000 hotel rooms were expected to be finished in November as part of the second phase.

The resort had 3,100 employees. The casino had 2,600 slot machines and was decorated with a world&#x27;s fair theme and bright colors. The casino was divided into three sections, each with its own international theme. The hotel included a bronze statue of Stupak, which he disliked and never approved, saying, &quot;They spent $100,000 more for that statue than I spent to open my first place in 1974.&quot; Another statue, in the center of the casino, featured a couple riding a dolphin set upon a bronze globe. The Stratosphere had seven restaurants, and the top of the tower contained two thrill rides. Stupak said, &quot;Anybody can build a tower. But if you build a tower and put a roller coaster on top—now, that&#x27;s Las Vegatizing.&quot;

===Financial problems===
The Stratosphere was projected to attract at least 5.5 million visitors in its first year. Around the time of its opening, financial analysts were optimistic about its financial prospects. Revenue for the first five weeks was lower than expected. Stratosphere Corporation attributed the low results to the resort being partly unfinished, and said it would borrow $48.5 million from Grand Casinos to finance enhancements to the property, including the completion of the 1,000 additional rooms and the opening of unfinished retail shops. The resort&#x27;s location away from the revitalized downtown and the mega-resorts of the Strip was another reason for its financial problems.

In addition, customer visitation to the tower was lower than expected, and many people did not stay to gamble in the casino. The casino was poorly designed, according to managers, as visitors to the tower were able to avoid the casino floor entirely. Berman said that weak marketing was also a factor in the poor revenue. Because the tower had already received so much publicity, Berman decided that a full marketing campaign was unnecessary. In the months after its opening, the resort continued to suffer financially. The unfinished hotel contained fewer rooms than most Las Vegas resorts, and occupancy was significantly below average for such a property. Another issue was that the two rides atop the tower had to be shut down whenever winds reached 35 miles per hour.

Stupak, who had already planned to move on to other projects, resigned as chairman less than three months after the opening, leaving Berman in charge. Explaining his departure, Stupak cited disagreements with a majority of the board members, saying that Grand Casinos executives ignored his advice and that he lacked influence considering his job title. Grand Casinos had agreed to keep Stupak as chairman only for the first 90 days after opening; his position was to be evaluated after that. Stupak&#x27;s statue was removed after he resigned and displayed in a gambling museum at the Tropicana hotel-casino.

In August 1996, Leroy&#x27;s established a temporary race and sports book in an effort to bring in more gamblers. The resort&#x27;s second phase was halted later that month for financial reasons; the additional hotel building consisted of an unfinished 15-story structure of concrete and rebar. There had also been plans for a $30 million aquarium attraction, measuring and set to open in 1997, but this never materialized.

Within six months of the opening, stock prices in Grand Casinos and Stratosphere Corporation dropped 50% and 80% respectively, and the resort laid off 400 employees. In an effort to attract more gamblers, the casino began offering favorable odds and returns on its table games and slots. The effort was part of a $1.4 million multimedia marketing campaign, and the plan was initially successful. The resort lost $254 million during 1996, but revenue improved during the final three months of the year thanks to the marketing program, which focused on gaming rather than the observation tower. In addition, admission prices for the tower and its rides were reduced. A roller coaster atop the tower was considered underwhelming, and was closed for improvements to make it longer and faster.

Nevertheless, the Stratosphere continued to struggle. In January 1997, the resort announced that it could no longer afford to honor thousands of prepaid vacation packages. Stratosphere Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy later that month after missing a $14.5 million interest payment to bondholders. Under the reorganization plan, the resort continued to operate. Existing shares in the company were canceled, and shareholders instead were given the right to buy stock in the company after its restructuring. Shareholders were upset by the plan, and some had already filed a class action lawsuit against Stratosphere Corporation and Grand Casinos, alleging deceit. In February 1997, people who had bought the vacation packages also sued Stupak and Grand Casinos.

Before the bankruptcy filing, Berman had intended to make the resort profitable. Stupak had called Berman &quot;the best casino operator in the world,&quot; but later said of Grand Casinos&#x27; operation of the resort, &quot;They just weren&#x27;t up to it.&quot; The resort continued to perform poorly during early 1997, in part because of competition with the recently opened New York-New York resort. Rainy and windy weather was another factor, reducing pedestrian traffic to the Stratosphere and interest in the tower&#x27;s observation deck and roller coaster. Because of the low revenue, Stratosphere Corporation was removed from the NASDAQ in April 1997, though the stock continued to be traded through the OTC Bulletin Board. A new reorganization plan was submitted that would cancel all existing stock, thereby excluding shareholders&#x27; right to buy stock in a restructured company.

===Carl Icahn ownership===
In June 1997, corporate raider and businessman Carl Icahn purchased 20 percent of mortgage bonds in Stratosphere Corporation, while Berman and other investors in Stratosphere Corporation sold off their shares. Grand Casinos remained as the largest shareholder in the resort. In July 1997, Icahn announced plans to sell shares in his company, American Real Estate Partners, to raise money to purchase the Stratosphere entirely. Icahn announced a new reorganization plan that was viewed more favorably than the latest one proposed by Grand Casinos. Berman and other board members of Stratosphere Corporation resigned, with Berman saying, &quot;Grand wants to avoid being on the board when proposals such as Icahn&#x27;s are being reviewed. I think it&#x27;s difficult when your company has a proposal and another company is offering a better proposal.&quot;

In August 1997, Stupak made a plan to regain control of the Stratosphere by purchasing $1 million in mortgage notes. He also planned to air a half-hour video in which he criticized the board members who resigned, saying, &quot;We have to save the Stratosphere. We have to save the shareholders. You have a duty, a fiduciary duty. I&#x27;m reminding you to do this.&quot; Stupak went on to say, &quot;They lost more money than I ever heard of. So what did they do? They surrendered. They surrendered and left town.&quot; Stupak was also critical of Stratosphere Corporation for refusing to meet with him to discuss his own proposal for reorganization. A day after announcing his video, Stupak decided to shelve its airing, stating that he had already caught people&#x27;s interest. He said the video was no longer necessary and that the timing no longer felt right. In October 1997, Grand Casinos confirmed that it would have no further involvement in the Stratosphere and its reorganization.
The Stratosphere owed $313 million to creditors. Icahn&#x27;s reorganization plan was approved, and Stupak settled the lawsuit concerning vacation packages. Older shares in the Stratosphere were canceled. Lakes Gaming, formerly Grand Casinos, would later settle a lawsuit brought by former Stratosphere shareholders, and the company prevailed in a lawsuit brought by bondholders of the resort. Icahn&#x27;s purchase received final approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission in August 1998, and the Stratosphere exited bankruptcy two months later. Icahn planned $100 million in improvements, including the completion of the additional hotel rooms. However, he inherited various lawsuits when he purchased the Stratosphere, and construction would not resume until such issues were resolved.

In the years after Icahn took over, Stupak sometimes visited the Stratosphere&#x27;s Top of the World restaurant but was otherwise uninterested in the resort. In 2001, Stupak said that he felt prouder when he opened his earlier casinos on the site in 1974 and 1979. Stupak stated his biggest disappointment with the Stratosphere was not being able to have it built out to 1,825 feet. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be the guy who built a tall tower in Las Vegas. I want to be the guy who built the tallest structure in the world.&quot;

In 1999, ownership switched to American Real Estate Partners, and Icahn remained as the controlling investor. A new sportsbook was added that year. Revenue saw improvement in 2000, and approximately 8,000 people visited the tower daily. The resort had 2,200 employees.
Construction of the unfinished hotel tower resumed on April 14, 2000. The tower, with 24 stories, was topped off on November 2, 2000. The $65 million project included 1,002 rooms, a pool and recreation area, and a coffee shop. Excluding the new tower, the hotel had 1,444 rooms. The new project was meant to improve business at the casino and its retail mall, the Tower Shops. The new facilities were opened in mid-2001. The casino floor was brightened and the resort&#x27;s buffet was expanded as part of the renovation project.

Icahn planned for the Stratosphere to target value-conscious visitors. Focusing on this demographic, Icahn turned the Stratosphere into a profitable business. The hotel&#x27;s room rates were among the lowest for a Las Vegas resort. The casino&#x27;s poker room was closed in early 2001, as it was not a significant source of revenue, and it conflicted with the renovation plans. In 2001, the tower was temporarily closed following the September 11 attacks, out of concern that it could be a target for terrorists.

In 2003, several additions were being considered, including a convention center, a nightclub, and an indoor go-cart track. In 2004, ownership of the Stratosphere was transferred to Icahn&#x27;s new company, American Casino &amp; Entertainment Properties (ACEP). Refurbishments were underway on its sign, porte-cochère, and valet area. The resort also opened a topless pool area on the hotel&#x27;s 25th floor known as Beach Club 25, later renamed Radius. The Beach Club 25 area had previously served as the resort&#x27;s original pool, until the 2001 renovation. The topless pool concept was introduced to appeal to the Stratosphere&#x27;s European visitors, and to attract a younger demographic that had become increasingly common in Las Vegas. The topless pool area operates in addition to a separate, non-topless pool on the hotel&#x27;s eighth floor.

Like other resorts, the Stratosphere was particularly popular in 2006 and 2007, before the Great Recession. A retro-themed nightclub, named Polly Esther&#x27;s, opened in March 2007. It featured themes based on the past four decades, with memorabilia dating back to the 1970s.

===2008 sale and renovations===

In April 2007, Icahn announced that he would sell ACEP and its properties, including the Stratosphere, to a Goldman Sachs affiliate known as Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds. The sale included 17 acres of adjacent, undeveloped land. Whitehall completed its purchase in February 2008, and the company planned to spend $25 million on improvements to the Stratosphere.

Many managers were fired and replaced under the new ownership, despite earlier assurances that such jobs would be safe from termination. Some employees complained about the firing of their managers, which occurred following the 2007–2008 financial crisis in the United States. Other employees stated that the fired managers were inept or stealing money from the casino, and that they showed favoritism among workers. Under the new ownership, employees were given stricter work guidelines to follow, which was met with mixed reactions from workers and gamblers. Polly Esther&#x27;s closed at the end of 2008. As a result of the ensuing Great Recession, the Stratosphere laid off workers in 2009, and continued to struggle into 2010.

A $20 million renovation project began in 2010. Improvements were made to the casino, the main entrance, the Top of the World restaurant, and other areas. A major aspect of the project was the renovation of 909 hotel rooms, out of 2,427. Other renovations continued into 2012, and included the addition of a new poker room.

For years, the Stratosphere sat alone as the sole resort in the area. The only other nearby resort, the Sahara, closed in 2011, causing a significant drop in pedestrian traffic for the Stratosphere. However, the Sahara reopened as the SLS Las Vegas in 2014, and the Stratosphere was expected to benefit from the increased visitation in the area. A British man became the 40 millionth visitor to the tower on April 21, 2014, and received a $2,500 prize package. In September 2014, a man, under the influence of drugs, crashed his pickup truck through the resort&#x27;s front entrance and was arrested.

In 2015, the Stratosphere launched an advertising campaign targeting its middle-class clientele, while criticizing high-priced Strip resorts. The Stratosphere celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2016. At the time, the resort had 1,600 employees. Most of its clientele consisted of tourists from southern California, as well as international locations such as Canada, Germany, and Great Britain. The resort&#x27;s gaming revenue had yet to fully recover from the effects of the Great Recession, although other aspects of the property performed well.

===Golden Entertainment===
In June 2017, Golden Entertainment agreed to purchase ACEP. Golden Entertainment&#x27;s $850 million purchase of the company, including the Stratosphere, was completed in October 2017. In March 2018, Golden Entertainment announced plans for a $140 million renovation of the Stratosphere that would be completed over three phases. According to management, some people were unaware that the Stratosphere was a resort, believing it to be merely an observation tower. The renovations were aimed at raising awareness of the resort amenities. Renovations were underway later in 2018. A new gaming pit was debuted, and 300 rooms were renovated, among other changes.

On February 1, 2019, plans were announced to rename the resort as The Strat, a common nickname among local residents. The transition to The Strat began with two commercials aired locally two days later, during Super Bowl LIII. The name change would become official at a later date.

A three-piece statue, created by local artists, was installed at the resort&#x27;s front entrance in April 2019. The statue consists of three stainless steel figures staring at the tower. They range in height from nine to 15 feet, with the tallest one pointing at the tower. Blake Sartini, the chairman and CEO of Golden Entertainment, said the statue was a symbol of the resort&#x27;s new branding.
Two areas for live entertainment – one on the casino floor and one in the former space of a lounge – were being added in June 2019, along with a new slot machine lounge. &quot;STRAT&quot; signage was installed in August 2019, and renovations on the south end of the casino floor were completed that year. Other renovations have included the resort&#x27;s exterior and landscaping. The Strat also installed drone detection technology, alerting the property whenever illegal drones are flown near the tower.

The resort was officially renamed The Strat during a celebration held on January 22, 2020. Among the attendees to the event were Nevada governor Steve Sisolak, congresswoman Dina Titus, Sammy Hagar, Guy Fieri, and Rick Springfield. Renovations were largely finished at the time, with the exception of a self-check-in area and remodeling that was scheduled to begin on the casino&#x27;s north side during the second quarter of 2020. Half of the resort&#x27;s 2,427 hotel rooms had been remodeled, and future renovations would also take place on the remaining rooms. The casino, considered dark before, was remodeled with a new color scheme and an open layout. A new William Hill sports book was also added.

The renovations, including four new restaurants, were designed to retain customers who usually only visited the pod area. The renovation was also intended to help the property compete against nearby rivals, including the renovated Sahara and two upcoming properties: Resorts World (2021) and Fontainebleau (2023). Another renovation, focusing on 537 rooms and the pool area, was completed in 2023.

==Property overview==

The hotel and casino facilities are located at the base of the observation tower. The Strat&#x27;s location, in regard to the Las Vegas Strip, has been debated. Although the Stratosphere was considered north of the Strip at the time of its 1996 opening, it advertised itself as being on the Strip, with the slogan, &quot;We define the top of the Strip.&quot; Frank Riolo, the CEO of AREP, said in 2011, &quot;It&#x27;s not Downtown, it&#x27;s not the Strip and it&#x27;s not a locals property. We try to run it as a hybrid.&quot;

Tourists and some local residents consider the Strat to be part of the Strip, which would make it the only Strip resort within city limits. However, Clark County considers the Strat to be several blocks north of the Strip. According to the county, the Strip does not officially extend into city limits. Golden Entertainment nonetheless advertises the resort as a Strip property, as did its predecessor, Stratosphere builder Bob Stupak.
===Observation tower===

The resort was named after the stratosphere in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as a reference to the height of the tower. At , it is the tallest freestanding observation tower in the United States, and the second-tallest in the Western Hemisphere, surpassed only by the CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario. It is the tallest tower west of the Mississippi River, and also the tallest structure in Las Vegas and in the state of Nevada. Because the tower is not fully habitable, it is not considered a building, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Because of its visibility, the tower serves as a visual aid for some motorists in the Las Vegas Valley. The tower also presents problems for air traffic controllers, who have to guide certain planes to avoid the structure.

The tower is a popular draw for tourists, and is a notable part of the Las Vegas skyline. The top of the tower has two observation decks and a restaurant known as &quot;Top of the World&quot;, in addition to lounges, four thrill rides, and a wedding chapel. An indoor observation deck is located on the 108th floor, while stairs lead to an outdoor deck on the 109th floor, both providing wraparound views of the Las Vegas Valley. The indoor deck was remodeled in 2019.

The tower elevators, among the fastest in the world, travel at a speed of . The tower also includes 1,455 steps leading up to the 108th floor, which rises . Since 2009, the tower has hosted a fundraising event called Scale the Strat, which benefits the American Lung Association. Hundreds of people compete each year in the stair-racing event, in which individual participants race to the top of the tower for the best time, separated from each other by one-minute intervals. Aside from the races, the stairs are otherwise closed to the public.
The tower cost $70 million to construct. It weighs approximately 50,000 tons and has nearly of reinforced steel bars. The tower&#x27;s pod includes the restaurant and contains 12 stories. The exterior of the pod has one and a half miles of criss-crossed fiber-optic cable with lights which alternate between eight different colors. A needle located on top of the pod consists of a steel-beam frame with an internal ladder. Atop the needle frame are two four-inch beams which are laid out horizontally to form an &quot;X&quot;. A special rig for window washers is situated around the pod windows. In 2005, local jazz station KOAS 105.7 (FM) installed an antenna at the top of the tower, becoming the first station to do so. KVGS 107.9 (FM) also has an antenna atop the tower.

During the design and construction phase, four fire inspectors were assigned to the project to ensure that it would be fire-safe. The tower was built with three emergency generators. At the time of opening, the pod included two concrete-banded bunker floors, located beneath its three wedding chapels. The bunker was built on the two lowest floors of the pod, as smoke rises. In the case of a fire, the tower&#x27;s elevators would be used for evacuation of the pod, unlike most buildings in which stairs would be used instead.

The base of the tower starts with three legs made of concrete, each weighing approximately and rising , before meeting to form a center. From there, the tower rises further before reaching the start of the pod, at approximately . The east tower leg was reportedly built at a crooked angle, due to a measurement mix-up. Two decades after its opening, a resort executive said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t own the property when it was built, and cannot verify this.&quot; He noted that an engineering firm made periodic inspections to ensure structural integrity.

During its construction, the tower won several negative awards from the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, which named it as the &quot;Las Vegas event you are tired of hearing about,&quot; the &quot;worst Las Vegas eyesore,&quot; and the &quot;community&#x27;s biggest embarrassment.&quot; It was also voted worst casino theme in 1997, and worst attraction four years later. In 2006, readers of the newspaper named the Stratosphere as the ugliest building in Las Vegas.

Five people, bypassing security measures, have committed suicide by jumping from the tower&#x27;s observation area, between 2000 and 2007. Additional suicides from jumping occurred in 2014 and 2021.

===Attractions===

Rides at the Strat include:
*Big Shot, opened along with the resort in 1996. The ride travels up and down the tower&#x27;s needle. At , it was the highest thrill ride in the world until the Sky Drop opened on the Canton Tower at .
*X-Scream, opened in 2003. At , it is the fourth highest thrill ride in the world. It consists of a single car that rolls back and forth on a straight piece of track that slightly overhangs the tower and pivots vertically in a see-saw motion.
*Insanity, opened in 2005. At is the third highest thrill ride in the world; it dangles riders over the edge of the tower and then spins in a circular pattern at approximately . In an incident shortly after opening, riders were left dangling several hundred feet for nearly an hour and a half when Insanity shut down; it was programmed to cease operation if a fault or problem is detected by the ride&#x27;s control system. Strong winds caused the system to trigger the emergency stop.
*SkyJump Las Vegas, opened in 2010. SkyJump is a controlled-descent, bungee jumping-like ride that allows riders to plummet attached to a high-speed descent wire. SkyJump had its 100,000th rider in 2013, and its 200,000th in 2015.

A previous ride, a roller coaster called the High Roller, opened with the resort in 1996. It rode around the top of the tower pod. It closed on December 30, 2005, and was dismantled. The ride was considered underwhelming and was poorly received in comparison to the other rides. However, it was a financial success and attracted nearly 4 million riders by the time of its closure. At , it was the second highest ride in the world and the highest roller coaster.

Strat-O-Fair, a midway themed after the 1963 World&#x27;s fair, opened at the base of the tower in June 2000. Among its attractions were bumper cars and a Ferris wheel, measuring 45 feet in diameter.

In 2024, the Strat opened Atomic Golf, a four-story golf entertainment facility. The project, which cost $75 million, includes 103 hitting bays and several bars. It was built on seven acres – located directly north of the resort – that were leased out to developer Flite Golf &amp; Entertainment.

====Unbuilt rides====
Two rides were proposed for the tower but were never built. As the resort opened in 1996, there were plans to add a $6 million &quot;King Kong&quot; ride, also known as &quot;Belly of the Beast&quot;. Riders would be placed in the stomach of a giant mechanical gorilla that would scale the Stratosphere tower. The ride would carry a total of 48 people and would go halfway up the tower. On its way down, the ride would drop several feet at a time, to give riders the sensation of falling. The ride&#x27;s opening was delayed in May 1996, because design and engineering work took longer than expected. The project was canceled two months later. A Stratosphere spokesman said, &quot;It was determined to be not feasible and we couldn&#x27;t be sure it would be an exciting ride. It was an engineering challenge, to say the least.&quot; The ride had been scheduled to open later in 1996.

The second ride was proposed in 2001, acting as a $20 million roller coaster that would transport riders over Las Vegas Boulevard. A 740-foot tower would be built next to the Stratosphere tower, and the roller coaster would travel down this new tower before going up a 416-foot tower on the opposite side of the street. Area residents were opposed to the ride, citing concerns about its impact on housing values and the quality of life. Residents were concerned about noise and traffic that would occur in the area if the ride were built, although the resort denied that noise would be an issue. Nevada Assemblywoman Chris Giunchigliani said the ride would make the neighborhood look like a carnival.

The Stratosphere stated that the new ride was necessary to compete against the nearby Adventuredome, as well as a NASCAR attraction at the Sahara resort. The earlier King Kong ride had received city approval in 1996, with no expiration, and resort executives suggested that they may revive that project if the Las Vegas City Council were to reject the new roller coaster proposal. Residents were also opposed to the King Kong ride. In response to the opposition, the Stratosphere suggested that it may withdraw financial support for the Las Vegas Monorail project, which would connect downtown with the Las Vegas Strip. The roller coaster ride failed to get the support of the city council, and the Stratosphere withdrew its financing of $250,000 for the monorail project, which would have had a stop at the resort. A scaled-back, slower version of the roller coaster ride was proposed in 2002, but it was also denied approval. The Stratosphere took legal action in an effort to get the ride built, but the resort lost its challenges in court.

===Restaurants===

Top of the World is a revolving restaurant, taking about 80 minutes to complete a full rotation. It is located on the 106th floor of the tower, providing overhead views of the Las Vegas Valley.

The resort has had numerous other restaurants, including a buffet, and a steakhouse known as McCall&#x27;s Heartland Grill. Roxy&#x27;s Diner had operated since the resort&#x27;s opening. It eventually closed in 2018, replaced by the Strat Café.

A snack bar, 108 Eats, opened on the 108th floor observation deck in 2019. PT&#x27;s, a local chain of bar-restaurants owned by Golden Entertainment, opened a location at the Strat in 2020, under the name PT&#x27;s Wings &amp; Sports.

===Tower Shops===
The Tower Shops is a mall on the second level. The elevators that lead up to the observation decks are only accessible in the mall. DeBartolo Realty Corporation, which owned a 50-percent interest in the Tower Shops, was acquired by Simon Property Group in March 1996, forming Simon DeBartolo Group. The Tower Shops were a joint venture between Simon DeBartolo Group and Gordon Group, under the name Strato-Retail. The Stratosphere leased the retail space to Strato-Retail, which then subleased it to retail tenants.
When the Stratosphere opened in April 1996, its retail area was still largely under construction and consisted only of vendor carts spread across three areas with their own theme: Chinese, French, and Manhattan. The mall was built by Missouri construction company McCarthy, which was finishing the first phase in May 1996. Because of the resort&#x27;s financial problems, the next phase of the Tower Shops was halted in August 1996, leaving the mall with of retail space. The second phase, scheduled for completion in December 1996, would have increased the mall to . The second phase would have included a Rainforest Cafe as its main anchor tenant. A Kids Quest child-care center was also planned as part of the second phase.

As of February 1997, the mall had 32 of 45 stores opened, with the remainder expected to open by the end of the second quarter. The mall had approximately 300 employees. As of October 1997, there were 36 stores, including a clothing store owned by Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones, who also owned shares in Grand Casinos. Approximately 85 percent of the retail space was occupied, and 98 percent was leased.

By 1998, retailers in the Tower Shops were experiencing financial difficulties and lack of customer traffic, which the retailers blamed on the resort&#x27;s unfinished facilities. Strato-Retail filed suits against several of the mall&#x27;s retailers, alleging non-payment of rent. Two retailers that were locked in for expensive, long-term leases filed suits against Strato-Retail. As of March 1999, the Stratosphere planned to add a new escalator which the resort said would lead up to the casino&#x27;s showroom. However, Strato-Retail sued Stratosphere Corporation, alleging that the escalator would hinder business to the Tower Shops by allowing visitors to bypass the mall on their way to the top of the observation tower. The resort denied that the escalator could be used to access the tower. Strato-Retail won a permanent injunction against the escalator&#x27;s construction.

In 2000, Stratosphere Corporation purchased the mall from Strato-Retail for $12.5 million. In 2004, the Tower Shops had of retail space, which was approximately 90 percent leased. That year, the mall announced plans for an additional of retail space. The expansion would occupy undeveloped space that was meant for the Tower Shops&#x27; originally planned second phase. At the time, the mall had approximately 50 stores and 15 retail carts.

==Live entertainment==
At its opening, the Stratosphere included the 700-seat Broadway showroom, and a 300-seat lounge called the Images Cabaret, which also hosted performers. The Stratosphere opened along with a celebrity impersonator show known as &quot;American Superstars&quot;, which initially ran in the lounge. Danny Gans also had a residency, which took place in the showroom. Gans&#x27; contract expired at the end of 1996, and he moved on to the Rio resort, after disagreements with the Stratosphere. Gans had wanted more advertising from the Stratosphere for his show, although the resort was financially unable to do so. The resort, meanwhile, wanted Gans to perform more often, which he declined to do. Following his departure, &quot;American Superstars&quot; moved into the showroom.

A small-scale afternoon show, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, opened in the Broadway showroom in October 1996, in an effort to improve the resort&#x27;s finances. The show had previously run for five years at the Sands Hotel and Casino, until its closing earlier in 1996. Hypnotist Marshall Sylver opened a show in the Images Cabaret in 1997. Two years later, Images Cabaret was relocated elsewhere in the resort, as the original location was replaced by the new sports book.
As of 2001, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; was the longest continuously running afternoon show in Las Vegas history. An outdoor stage, called the Outdoor Events Center, opened later that year. Built in the form of a grandstand, it offered seating for approximately 3,600 people. As an alternative to larger venues, the Outdoor Events Center offered low-priced events, which included boxing matches and musical performances. In 2004, the resort&#x27;s Theater of the Stars showroom launched a topless vampire-themed show by Tim Molyneux called &quot;Bite&quot;, featuring rock and roll music. &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; closed in December 2006.

&quot;American Superstars&quot; closed in March 2011, as the producers and resort came to a mutual decision to end the show after a 15-year run. It was one of the longest-running shows in Las Vegas history. Later that year, singer Frankie Moreno signed a two-year residency. The Theater of the Stars showroom was renovated under the direction of Moreno, and was renamed as the Stratosphere Showroom. Tommy Ward was Moreno&#x27;s opening act for nine-months. &quot;Bite&quot; ended its run in 2012.

David Perrico, with the band Pop Evolution, signed in 2013 for a monthly show. Claire Sinclair, a &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate, starred in a burlesque musical show titled &quot;Pin Up&quot;, which launched in 2013 and ran for four years. Moreno signed an extension and eventually concluded his residency at the end of 2014. By 2016, the resort had begun offering a Michael Jackson tribute show called &quot;MJ Live&quot;.

The Strat added an acrobatic show, &quot;Celestia&quot;, in June 2019. The show was performed inside a tent located outside the Strat. &quot;Celestia&quot; closed in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A year later, plans were underway to renovate the Strat&#x27;s 600-seat theater. The resort partnered with SPI Entertainment and hoped to make the resort a well-known destination for live entertainment. Illusionist Xavier Mortimer opened a magic show on July 1, 2021. Another magic show, by mentalist Banachek, was opened a month later, along with a glow-in-the-dark dance show by iLuminate. A concert residency by Sammy Hagar took place later in 2021. &quot;Rouge&quot;, a show featuring topless dancers, debuted the following year.

<doc id="693712" wikidata="Q37300" url="?curid=693712" title="Gallo language">
<text>Gallo (endonym: &quot;Galo&quot;; ) is a regional language of eastern Brittany. It is one of the langues d&#x27;oïl, a Romance sub-family that includes French. Today it is spoken only by a minority of the population, as the standard form of French now predominates in this area.

Gallo was originally spoken in the Marches of Neustria, an area now corresponding to the border lands between Brittany, Normandy, and Maine. Gallo was a shared spoken language among many of those who took part in the Norman conquest of England, most of whom originated in Upper (i.e. eastern) Brittany and Lower (i.e. western) Normandy, and thus had its part, together with the much bigger role played by the Norman language, in the development of the Anglo-Norman variety of French which would have such a strong influence on English.

Gallo continued as the everyday language of Upper Brittany, Maine, and some neighbouring portions of Normandy until the introduction of universal education across France, but is spoken today by only a small (and aging) minority of the population, having been almost entirely superseded by standard French.

As a &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot;, Gallo forms part of a dialect continuum which includes Norman, Picard, and the Poitevin dialect among others. One of the features that distinguish it from Norman is the absence of Old Norse influence. There is some limited mutual intelligibility with adjacent varieties of the Norman language along the linguistic frontier and with Guernésiais and Jèrriais. However, as the dialect continuum shades towards Mayennais, there is a less clear isogloss. The clearest linguistic border is that distinguishing Gallo from Breton, a Brittonic Celtic language traditionally spoken in the western territory of Brittany.

In the west, the vocabulary of Gallo has been influenced by contact with Breton, but remains overwhelmingly Latinate. The influence of Breton decreases eastwards across Gallo-speaking territory.

, Gallo&#x27;s western extent stretches from Plouha (&quot;Plóha&quot;), in Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, south of Paimpol, passing through Châtelaudren (&quot;Châtié&quot;), Corlay (&quot;Corlaè&quot;), Loudéac (&quot;Loudia&quot;), east of Pontivy, Locminé (&quot;Lominoec&quot;), Vannes, and ending in the south, east of the Rhuys peninsula, in Morbihan.

==Nomenclature==

While most often spelled &quot;Gallo&quot;, the name of the language is sometimes written as &quot;Galo&quot; or &quot;Gallot&quot;. It is also referred to as or in Brittany. In south Lower Normandy and in the west of it is often referred to as patois, though this is a matter of some contention. &quot;Gallo&quot; comes from the Breton word , meaning &#x27;foreigner&#x27;, &#x27;French&#x27; or &#x27;non-Breton&#x27;. The term was first used by Breton speakers, which may explain why it is used rarely by Gallo speakers themselves. Henriette Walter conducted a survey in 1986 which showed that just over 4% of Gallo speakers in had ever used the term, and a third of them found it &quot;had quite a pejorative connotation&quot;. According to the survey, the term was the most common way of referring to the language.

The term was coined by the linguist Alan-Joseph Raude in 1978 to highlight the fact that Gallo is &quot;a Romance variety spoken by Bretons&quot;. Gallo should not be confused with &quot;Gallo-Roman&quot;, a term that refers to the Romance varieties of ancient Gaul.

== Linguistic classification ==
Gallo is one of the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;, a dialect continuum covering the northern half of France. This group includes a wide variety of more or less well-defined and differentiated languages and dialects, which share a Latin origin and some Germanic influence from Frankish, the language spoken by the Franks.

Gallo, like the other &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;, is neither ancient French nor a distortion of modern French. The &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; are Gallo-Romance languages, which also includes Franco-Provençal, spoken around Savoy. These are in turn Romance languages, a group which also includes, among others, Catalan, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian.

Gallo has not just borrowed words from Breton, but also aspects of grammar; the use of the preposition &quot;pour&quot; as an auxiliary verb is said to be of Celtic origin. The relationship between the two is comparable to that of the two languages of Scotland: Scots, an Anglic language closely related to English, and Scottish Gaelic, a Celtic language descended from Old Irish.

Gallo is typically not mutually intelligible with French, primarily due to its differing phonology and vocabulary. This is in spite of what Paul Sébillot wrote in 1878: &quot;[Gallo] is a dialect of French (...): it contains a considerable quantity of old words, a very small amount of words borrowed from Breton, and is, except for several local expressions (...) very easy to understand.&quot; The study of language has evolved considerably since the 19th century, however, and there is no longer any universally accepted criterion to distinguish decisively between language and dialect.

==Celtic, Latin and Germanic roots==
The Celts settled in Armorica toward the 8th century BCE. Some of early groups mentioned in the written records of the Greeks were the Redones and the Namnetes. They spoke dialects of the Gaulish language and maintained important economic ties with the British Isles. Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Armorica in 56 BC led to a sort of Romanization of the population. Gaulish continued to be spoken in this region until the 6th century CE, especially in less populated, rural areas. When the Bretons emigrated to Armorica around this time, they found a people who had retained their Celtic language and culture. The Bretons were therefore able to integrate easily.

In contrast to Armorica&#x27;s western countryside, Nantes and Rennes were Roman cultural centres. Following the Migration Period, these two cities, as well as regions to the east of the Vilaine, including the town Vannes, fell under Frankish rule. Thus, during the Merovingian dynasty, the population of Armorica was diverse, consisting of Gaulish tribes with assimilated Bretons, as well as Romanized cities and Germanic tribes. War between the Frank and Breton kingdoms was constant between the 6th and 9th centuries, which made the border between the two difficult to define. Before the 10th century, Breton was spoken by at least one third of the population up to the cities of Pornic and Avranches.

== Decline of Gallo ==
Historically, France has been a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity matched with relative tolerance, that is until the French Revolution. Gallo&#x27;s status as a tolerated regional language of France suffered as a direct consequence of the Revolution. During this time, the Jacobins viewed regional languages as a way in which the structural inequalities of France were perpetuated. Accordingly, they sought to eradicate the regional languages to free their speakers of unconstitutional inequalities.

Under the Third Republic, public education became universal and mandatory in France, and was conducted exclusively in French; students who spoke other languages were punished. Well into the 20th century, government policy focused exclusively on French. In 1962, Charles de Gaulle established the &quot;Haut Comité pour la défense et l&#x27;expansion de la langue française&quot;; this committee&#x27;s purpose was to enforce the use of French, to the detriment of minority languages. Furthermore, in 1994, the Loi Toubon declared that any governmental publications and advertisements must be in French. Gallo did not gain national recognition until the Constitution of France was amended in 2008. Article 75-1 asserts that &quot;regional languages are part of the French heritage&quot;. Moreover, Gallo is the only langue d&#x27;oïl to be recognized as a regional language by the French Ministry of Education. Nevertheless, like all of the other regional languages of France, the use of Gallo has declined since the 19th century.

Similar to speakers of other regional languages, Gallo speakers began to associate French as the language of intellectuals and social promotion, and Gallo as an impediment to their success. As a result, the rate of children learning the language has diminished, since parents struggle to see the benefit of Gallo in their children&#x27;s future.

== Gallo and education ==
Within recent history, the presence of Gallo has fluctuated in Brittany&#x27;s school system. Shortly before World War II, the Regional Federation of Bretagne introduced the idea of rejuvenating Gallo&#x27;s presences in schools. They were primarily motivated in increasing the linguistic competence of children.

In 1982, Gallo was officially adopted as an optional subject in secondary schools in Brittany, even appearing on France&#x27;s secondary school-exit exam, the Baccalaureat. It took years for the Gallo language to actually be incorporated into the curriculum, but by the 1990s, the main focus of the curriculum was cultural awareness of the Gallo language and identity. However, in 2002, Gallo&#x27;s optional-subject status in secondary schools was withdrawn.

In reaction to the 2002 decision, an effective and committed network of Gallo activists advanced Gallo&#x27;s status in Brittany schools. Gallo is now taught in Upper Brittany&#x27;s state schools, though the number of students enrolled in Gallo courses remains low. In the 2003-04 academic year, there were 569 students learning Gallo at secondary school or university. For comparison, in the same year, 3,791 students were learning Breton at the same levels of schooling.

==Status==

On December 17, 2004, the Regional Council of Brittany officially recognized Breton and Gallo as &quot;the official languages of Brittany, alongside the French language.&quot;

One of the metro stations of the Breton capital, Rennes, has bilingual signage in French and Gallo, but generally the Gallo language is not as visibly high-profile as the Breton language, even in its traditional heartland of the , which includes the two historical capitals of Rennes (Gallo &quot;Resnn&quot;, Breton ) and Nantes (Gallo &quot;Nauntt&quot;, Breton ).

Different dialects of Gallo are distinguished, although there is a movement for standardisation on the model of the dialect of Upper Brittany.

It is difficult to record the exact number of Gallo speakers today. Gallo and vernacular French share a sort of continuum, so speakers may have difficulty determining exactly which language they are speaking. Many people speak Gallo while using a considerable amount of French words and phrases, thus confounding the language question further. Moreover, Gallo speakers may have a tendency to underestimate their competence and choose thus to not report speaking it. This makes estimates of the number of speakers vary widely.

==Literature==
Although a written literary tradition exists, Gallo is more noted for extemporised story-telling and theatrical presentations. Given Brittany&#x27;s rich musical heritage, contemporary performers produce a range of music sung in Gallo (see Music of Brittany).

The roots of written Gallo literature are traced back to &quot;Le Livre des Manières&quot; written in 1178 by Étienne de Fougères, a poetical text of 336 quatrains and the earliest known Romance text from Brittany, and to &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;Aquin&quot;, an anonymous 12th century chanson de geste transcribed in the 15th century but which nevertheless retains features typical of the mediaeval Romance of Brittany.

Gallo is a language of oral tradition, whose history is rich with stories, fables, and legends. Gallese legends frequently address recurring characters, such as Gargantua and Morgan le Fay, or questions of how the countryside was created. In the 19th century, oral literature was collected by researchers and folklorists such as Paul Sébillot, Adolphe Orain, Amand Dagnet and Georges Dottin. However, these authors frequently rewrote this literature in French. Paul Féval wrote certain dialogues in Gallo in his novel &quot;Châteaupauvre&quot; (1876). Amand Dagnet (1857-1933) also wrote a number of original works in Gallo, including a play &quot;La fille de la Brunelas&quot; (1901). In the 1920&#x27;s, Jeanne Malivel wrote &quot;Les Sept Frères&quot;, a story which was inspired by her grand-mother and was written in Gallo. This, in part, inspired the creation of the artistic movement &quot;Seiz Breur&quot;.

It was in the 1970s that a concerted effort to promote Gallo literature started. In 1979 Alan J. Raude published a proposed standardised orthography for Gallo.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
The consonants in Gallo are almost the same as in French, but there are many local variants, such as the voicing of s] into z] in Pays de Retz and that of t] into d] in Pays de la Mée. Certain consonant combinations are also characteristic of certain regions, such as the plosives c] and ɟ], which can be compared to k] or g] followed by a light j] sound. The affricates dʒ] and tʃ] appear in the western part of Haute-Bretagne, where, for example, the word &quot;curë&quot; [kyʁe] is pronounced as [tʃyʁə], and the word &quot;ghepe&quot; as [dʒep]. Elsewhere, [cyʁə] and [ɟəp] can be heard. &quot;Qhi&quot;, meanwhile, can be pronounced [ki], [tʃi] or [ci]. These modifications result from an advancement of the place of articulation of the palatal consonants. The semi-consonant [j] is used extensively to palatalize other consonants, notably [fj], [tj], [sj] and [pj]. However, this is not done in all regions, and [j] is often replaced by [l]. The word &quot;pllée&quot;, for example, can be pronounced [pje] or [ple].

Germanic in origin, h] generally hasn’t been pronounced since the 13th century, but it is still used in Mené, a small region around Merdrignac and Plémet.

* are bilabial, whereas are labiodental.
* are dental, whereas are alveolar.
* are palatal, are post-alveolar, and is labial-palatal.
* are velar, is uvular, and is labial-velar.

=== Vowels ===
The vowel system of Gallo is close to French, but they diverged as they evolved, and Gallo has a number of phenomena not found in French, such as the pervasive use of schwa and diphthongs.

In Gallo, as in French, the a] of Latin in stressed syllables has evolved into e] or eː]. Thus, &quot;adsátis&quot; became &quot;assé&quot; [ase]. However, while French has combined [e] and [eː] into just [e], a distinction was preserved in Gallo. The [eː], manifests, for example, when [a] was followed by [s], became either an [e] or a diphthong, most often [ej]. The [e] became a schwa (ə]) in most regions. This distinction between [e] and [eː] makes it possible to differentiate past participles by gender and number. While in standard French, &quot;chassé&quot;, &quot;chassée,&quot; and &quot;chassés&quot; are all pronounced the same, most Gallo speakers make a phonemic distinction between the masculine &quot;chassé&quot; [ʃasə] and the feminine &quot;chassée&quot; or plural &quot;chassés&quot; [ʃase]. In this example, the pronunciation of &quot;é&quot; was changed when the silent feminine or plural endings were added to the word.

Latin verbs with infinitives ending in -&quot;are&quot; followed the same evolutionary pattern as in French. &quot;Captiáre&quot; became &quot;chasser&quot; [ʃasə] in Gallo and &quot;chasser&quot; [ʃase] in French. This evolution of the [a] in stressed syllables varies from region to region. While in central Upper Brittany, schwa has replaced [e]. In some outlying regions, it is replaced by ɛ] or remains [e]. Some words do not obey the rule, such as &quot;pátre&quot; and &quot;mátre&quot;, which have become &quot;pere&quot; [peʁ] and &quot;mere&quot; [meʁ] in practically all of Upper Brittany, while [pəʁ] and [məʁ] are only heard in the center-west. The [a] in open stressed syllables before l] doesn&#x27;t follow the [e]/[eː] pattern either, and has evolved very differently in different regions. &quot;Sále&quot; has thus become &quot;sèl&quot;, &quot;sél&quot;, &quot;sé&quot; or &quot;seu&quot;. Schwa is also used to make a syllabic [l] and [ʁ], as in &quot;berton&quot; [bʁˌtɔ̃].

Like all langues d&#x27;oïl, Gallo underwent the vowel shift known as Bartsch&#x27;s law, according to which the Latin [a] in open stressed syllables, when preceded by a palatal consonant, became &quot;ie&quot;, as in &quot;cápra&quot;, which became &quot;chieuvr&quot;. As in French, the sound [j] represented by the letter i disappeared around the Renaissance, giving &quot;chèvre&quot; and &quot;cheuv&quot;, though this sound can still be observed in Côtes-d&#x27;Armor. In eastern Brittany, the disappearance of the sound was even more dramatic than in French, and some speakers say &quot;chen&quot; (dog), while the French word remains &quot;chien&quot; (from Latin &quot;cáne&quot;).

The Latin [e] in open stressed syllables has also evolved into &quot;ie&quot; in both Gallo and French, with &quot;hĕri&quot; becoming &quot;yere&quot;, for example. In Gallo, the vowel following the y differs from region to region. In most of Upper Brittany, it&#x27;s a schwa, and elsewhere it&#x27;s a [ɛ] or an [e] (the geographical distribution is the same as for [e]/[eː]). The Latin [o] in open stressed syllables became a &quot;ue&quot;, then monophthonged in both French and Gallo around the 12th century, becoming œ] in French, [ə] in Gallo. &quot;Cór&quot; thus became &quot;qheur&quot;. The evolution of the Latin [e] in closed stressed syllables is much more diverse, and the original diphthong &quot;éi&quot; has been replaced by a large number of phonemes varying from word to word and region to region. The many pronunciations of &quot;mai&quot;, from the Latin &quot;mé&quot;, illustrate this diversity: [maj], [ma], [me], [mɛ], etc. The pronunciation of Latin [o]/[u] in closed stressed syllables is more authentic in Gallo than in other langues d’oïl. &quot;Gùla&quot;, for example, is pronounced [gul] in Gallo, but [gœl] in French. Some terms, however, are influenced by neighboring langues d&#x27;oïl, and &quot;astour&quot; [astuʁ] (&quot;now&quot;, from Latin &quot;hóra&quot;) is becoming [astœʁ] in eastern Upper Brittany. In the south of Loire-Atlantique, thanks to contact with Poitevin, [ɔ] is common, and guernol [gɛʁnɔl] and parto [paʁtɔ] are heard instead of guernouille [gɛʁnuj] and partout [paʁtu].

=== Diphthongs ===
Gallo has diphthongs, just like Latin itself, other langues d’oïl, and other Romance languages. Diphthongs in Gallo generally use the semi-vowels [w] and [j], more rarely [ɥ]: [wa], [wə], [wi], [aw], [ja], [ju], [aj], [ej], [ɛ̃i], [ɥi], [ɥɛ̃], [ɥə], etc. The triphthong [jaw] is also used.

The very common diphthong [aw] most often is the result of the disappearance of a consonant that existed in Latin. For example, &quot;fagu&quot; (&quot;beech&quot;) became &quot;fao&quot;, and what once was two consecutive, separately pronounced vowels, [fau], has become a diphthong: [faw]. In some words, such as &quot;talpa&quot;, the [l] became a vowel, [u], and then [w], so [al] thus became [aw]: [tawp], while in French, the [al] merged into [o]: taupe [top]. In northern Upper Brittany, diphthongs are used to express plurals: un martè [maʁtə], des martiaos [maʁtjaw]. In Loire-Atlantique, only the plural form is used.

The nasal diphthong [ɛ̃ɔ̃], heard for example in &quot;grand&quot; ([gʁɛ̃ɔ̃] &quot;great&quot;) is typical of western langues d’oïl and is also found in Norman, Poitevin-Saintongeais and Angevin, sometimes in slightly different forms ([aɔ̃] in Saintongeais, [ɛ̃ɑ̃] in Norman).

== Orthography ==

=== Overview ===
There is not yet a single writing system that is unanimously agreed upon, mainly due to regional pronunciation differences. The word for “me” could be pronounced any of the following ways: [maj], [mεj], [mej], [ma], [mε] or [me]. This large variance makes it difficult to pick a single written form that would be most suitable. If the orthography of French was used, the word could be written in countless ways: &quot;maï, maye, maille, mèï, mey, meille, ma, mé, mè&quot;, etc.

However, the creation of a common writing system is important for ensuring comprehensibility of text across regions and making a dictionary. There are two main strategies that have been employed in past attempts at a writing system. One strategy proposes a single written form for words that will be pronounced differently according to the region. The other strategy proposes allowing a word to be written in multiple different ways, with different letters or letter combinations, to allow for speakers of Gallo to write according to their pronunciation. Another difference separating the proposed systems is their usage of silent letters and non-phonetic spelling. Some systems try to maintain a one-to-one correspondency between letters and sounds, whereas some choose to add silent letters or diagraphs in an attempt to better represent the sounds of Gallo.

The first effort to codify Gallo spelling was undertaken by the Friends of the Gallo Language (&quot;Association des Amis du parler gallo&quot;) in 1977. It proposed using French spelling as a baseline and adjusting it to fit Gallo’s unique phonetic features, such as using &quot;lh&quot; to indicate palatalization and &quot;ë&quot; to represent schwa. Since then, other systems have emerged, such as ELG, MOGA, ABCD, and BAP.
=== ELG ===
The ELG system (short for &quot;écrire le gallo&quot;, French for “write the Gallo [language]”), the oldest system, was proposed in 1978 by Alan-Joseph Raude and completely eschews French orthography. Raude based his writing system on medieval texts written in Gallo, therefore creating a system authentic to the language without reference to other modern writing systems. Regional differences were less pronounced during the Medieval era, meaning ELG’s spelling choices are based on a more standardized form.In the words for finger, evening, and me (in French: doigt, soir, moi), which display regional pronunciation differences, the “oi” found in French is written as “ei”, giving the forms: deit, seir, mei, though [ei] will not be the pronunciation everywhere.

Ruczèu (&quot;stream&quot;, in French: ruisseau) is pronounced [ʁysəw] in eastern Upper Brittany and [ʁyzəw] in the west. The &quot;ae&quot; in Bertaeyn (&quot;Brittany&quot;), can be pronounced [ae], [aɛ], [aə], or other possibilities. The diagraphs oe, cz, and tz are notable distinguishing elements of ELG.

Word-final &quot;e&quot; ceased to be pronounced as early as the twelfth century in Gallo, several centuries before French, so Raude proposes to not write them. On the other hand, word-final silent consonants are retained to preserve the continuity between derived forms: fauc (false) (the final c is not pronounced) is related to fauchae (to mow), where the consonant is pronounced. In French, word-final e often serves to indicate an otherwise silent consonant should be pronounced, such as in grand [grɑ̃] and grande [grɑ̃d]. ELG indicates this with a doubled consonant: graund and graundd.

ELG’s choices create a visually distinct system for Gallo, but it requires learning and is not immediately intuitive for Gallo speakers, who may not even recognize it as Gallo upon first seeing it.

ELG is used in some public places, such as for bilingual signage in the Rennes metro system.

=== Aneit ===
The Aneit system was introduced in 1984 by the Bertègn Galèzz Association, successor to the organization Friends of the Gallo Language. The system is the result of five years&#x27; research throughout Upper Brittany, and takes its name from the brochure presenting it to the public: &quot;Nostre lenghe aneit&quot; (&quot;our language today&quot;). Also called &quot;unified spelling&quot;, it follows in the footsteps of ELG in terms of its basis on etymology for its spelling.

The Aneit system differs from ELG on a number of points, however. For example, every letter must have a purpose, which means that the silent h and double consonants are eliminated, except in certain specific cases (ll to indicate palatalization, etc.). Aneit has the same difficulties as ELG, since a speaker with a different pronunciation needs to know the standardized spelling to be able to decipher the written system. Another problem faced by Aneit is its use of diacritics not easily accessible on a French keyboard (ó, ú and r̃).

=== Vantyé ===
The Vantyé spelling system was developed again by the Bertègn Galèzz association in the early 1980s, and is notable for its attempt to be closer to Breton. The letters &quot;k&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are not native to French, which prefers &quot;q&quot; and &quot;o&quot; plus a vowel to represent [k] and [w], respectively. Breton, however, uses &quot;k&quot; and &quot;w&quot; regularly, so the Vantyé system does as well. For example, &quot;ke&quot; (&quot;that&#x27;) and &quot;wézyaw&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;), compared to the French &quot;que&quot; and &quot;oiseau&quot;. Silent letters are also avoided in the Vantyé system.

Unlike ELG and Aneit, Vantyé is more of a practical tool than a codified orthography, and is therefore much easier to master. However, it was primarily designed for speakers in the Mitau region, and does not account for the phonemes that exist in other regions, making it less useful as a universal standard.

=== MOGA ===
The MOGA system was introduced in 2007 by Bèrtran Ôbrée and the Chubri Association. Unlike ELG and Aneit, which are based on etymology, it is a phonetic script. It is also intentionally close to French, making it easier for speakers of French to learn. For example, ɲ] is written with the French diagraph &quot;gn&quot; instead of less familiar propositions from previous systems such as &quot;ny&quot; or &quot;nh&quot;. Similarly, the diphthong [aw] is written &quot;ao&quot;, instead of the &quot;aù&quot; and &quot;au&quot; of previous systems, which could create confusion, because &quot;au&quot; is a diagraph in French corresponding to a single vowel, [o]. Each MOGA letter or diagraph corresponds to a single sound.

Regional varieties are taken into account, and letter combinations are used to represent all Gallo phonemes, even if they are only used by a few speakers. The diagraph &quot;lh&quot; signifies ʎ], a rare phoneme that is confined to central Côtes-d&#x27;Armor.

The same word can be written in different ways according to local usage, such as the city of Rennes, which could be written &quot;Renn, Rènn, Rein-n&quot; or &quot;Rin-n&quot;. There is therefore not one MOGA spelling, but many MOGA spellings.

=== ABCD ===
The ABCD system (from the initials of its inventors: Régis Auffray, André Bienvenu, André Le Coq, and Patrice Dréano) is used by the Association of Gallo Teachers and also the University of Rennes. It was created in 2009 and preserves the main principles of MOGA: similarity to French and phonetic spelling. Whereas MOGA allows only one sound per letter or group of letters, ABCD allows several, enabling users to make a choice. This covers regional variants, and a text in ABCD will not be read in the same way by all Gallo speakers. ABCD also mirrors the French trait of silent letters, such as the plural s, and is therefore easier to read without prior learning.

=== Spelling equivalencies between ELG, MOGA and ABCD ===

Sources:

Most consonants are written identically between the variants, and also the same as in French, and are not included in the table. As the pronunciation of ELG and ABCD letters varies greatly from region to region, this list is not exhaustive.

Additionally, MOGA and ABCD use the diagraph &quot;ll&quot; in words palatalized by certain Gallo speakers. Thus, &quot;bllë&quot; is pronounced [bjə] or [blə] depending on the region.

In ABCD, the combinations mm, nm and nn work differently than in French. When two nasal consonants are written in ABCD, the first consonant nasalizes the preceding vowel, and the second consonant is pronounced as normal. &quot;Fenme&quot; is pronounced [fɑ̃m] and not [fenm], as French orthography would dictate, and &quot;Janne&quot; is pronounced [ʒɑ̃n] and not [ʒan]. As in French, if the final letter is an e or a consonant, they are generally not pronounced.

In MOGA, [lj] is written &quot;lh&quot;, and &quot;ñ&quot; is used in place of &quot;n&quot; when the preceding consonant should not be nasal: &quot;diñra&quot; is pronounced [dinʁa].

In the ELG, certain letters and letter groups are only possible in certain positions, such as &quot;oey&quot;, which only exists at the ends of words. As in ABCD, final consonants in ELG are generally silent. The sound [s] is written as &quot;cz&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;ç&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, depending on its position in the word and the surrounding letters. Silent &quot;s&quot; at the end of a word is written &quot;tz.&quot;

<text>Bellagio ( ) is a resort, luxury hotel, and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned by Blackstone Inc. and operated by MGM Resorts International. Bellagio was conceived by casino owner Steve Wynn, and was built on the former site of the Dunes hotel-casino. Wynn&#x27;s company, Mirage Resorts, purchased the Dunes in 1992. Plans were announced in 1994 to replace it with Beau Rivage, a French-themed resort. In 1995, Wynn changed the project plans to instead theme it after the village of Bellagio, near Lake Como. The resort was designed by Jon Jerde. Construction began on November 1, 1995, with Marnell Corrao Associates as general contractor. 

Bellagio opened on October 15, 1998, with 3,005 rooms in a 36-story tower. Built at a cost of $1.6 billion, it was the world&#x27;s most expensive resort up to that point. Early revenue was less than expected, and Wynn departed the resort in May 2000, when Mirage Resorts merged with MGM Grand Inc. Profits improved under the ownership of the newly formed MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts). A 33-story hotel tower, with 928 rooms, was opened in 2004. MGM owned the Bellagio until 2019, when it sold the resort to Blackstone Inc. for $4.25 billion. MGM continues to operate the property under a lease arrangement.

Bellagio is located on . It includes a casino and 3,933 rooms. The resort&#x27;s signature attraction is the Fountains of Bellagio, a dancing water fountain synchronized to music. It is performed in an 8.5-acre man-made lake, located in front of the resort. Other attractions include the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, and a conservatory and botanical gardens. The hotel lobby features &quot;Fiori di Como&quot;, a sculpture by glass artist Dale Chihuly. It is the world&#x27;s largest glass sculpture.

Bellagio has numerous restaurants, including Le Cirque and Picasso, the latter by chef Julian Serrano. Other chefs at the resort have included Todd English, Michael Mina, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Wolfgang Puck. Bellagio includes an 1,800 seat theater for performances of &quot;O&quot;, a water-themed show by Cirque du Soleil. The property also has a high-end retail area which introduced several luxury brands to Las Vegas, including Chanel, Gucci, and Prada.

==History==
===Background and development===
The site of Bellagio was previously occupied by the Dunes hotel-casino, which opened in 1955. Through his company Mirage Resorts, casino owner Steve Wynn purchased the Dunes in November 1992, for $75 million. He intended to demolish it and build a new resort in its place. An early idea was to build five or six complexes with approximately 500 rooms each, along with a small theme park. As the Dunes closed in January 1993, Wynn proposed including a man-made lake in his new project for water skiing and windsurfing. County officials questioned whether such a feature could be included following the passage of a 1990 water ordinance. A state expert found it unlikely that the lake would cause major soil sinking. The county modified the ordinance in February 1994, allowing Wynn to proceed with a man-made lake, on the condition that he honor his claim that it would use less water than the Dunes&#x27; former golf course.

On October 17, 1994, Mirage Resorts announced plans to build the French-themed Beau Rivage resort on the land, at a cost of $700-$900 million. It would be surrounded by a 50-acre lake with guests entering by footbridges. Mirage Resorts announced a name change in July 1995, stating that the resort would be named Bellagio, after the village of Bellagio, Lombardy in northern Italy. The resort&#x27;s designer, Jon Jerde, had been vacationing on Lake Como. Impressed by its beauty, he convinced Wynn to come see the area. While on the lake with friend Paul Anka, Wynn noticed the nearby village of Bellagio, and spent half a day there. The village&#x27;s Italian architecture inspired Wynn to scrap 10 months&#x27; worth of design work for Beau Rivage in favor of a Bellagio-themed resort. Wynn would later use the Beau Rivage name for another resort in Mississippi.

The Las Vegas project was revised and scaled back. Among the changes was a reduction in the size of the lake feature; Mirage Resorts determined that it would use too much water as originally planned. The hotel tower, originally planned at 49 stories, was also reduced. The design and planning process took a total of 28 months, dating to 1993. Wynn said &quot;there was no need to rush the project. We wanted to get it right&quot;. Jerde&#x27;s design firm spent a total of four years designing the project. Wynn&#x27;s in-house design team, Atlandia Design, handled the interior. Aside from the Dunes, a Denny&#x27;s restaurant was also demolished to make way for Bellagio.

Construction began on November 1, 1995, and the opening was initially scheduled for March 1998. Marnell Corrao Associates served as general contractor. The project&#x27;s cost increased several times, in part because of new features being added. A shortage of skilled workers also resulted in rising labor costs. It was financed through various lenders. Finished at a cost of $1.6 billion, it was the most expensive resort ever built.

Wynn envisioned the Bellagio as a five-star resort catering to tourists who typically visit places other than Las Vegas, such as Paris, London, or Venice. He said Bellagio would &quot;redefine Las Vegas&quot;, describing it as the &quot;most ambitious&quot; and luxurious project ever attempted by Mirage Resorts. He also said it would be &quot;the most romantic, delicious place ever built in the world&quot;, as well as the &quot;greatest&quot; and &quot;most beautiful&quot; hotel ever.

The property features a variety of trees. Before the opening, builders spent more than a year searching the western U.S. for mature Japanese privets, which are capable of withstanding the dry Las Vegas heat. A deal was reached to remove approximately 30 privets from the government center in Ventura County, California, and replant them at Bellagio, at a cost of nearly $10,000 per tree. The resort&#x27;s pool area is surrounded by a Mediterranean garden that included nearly 300 pine trees, left over from the Dunes golf course.

===Opening===
The opening was highly anticipated, and crowd-control measures were in preparation months prior. Mirage Resorts launched a $10 million advertising campaign which included 60-second television commercials, featuring opera singer Andrea Bocelli.

A pre-opening VIP party took place on the night of October 15, 1998, with 1,800 in attendance, including Nevada governor Bob Miller. The public opening followed at 10:45 p.m. Crowds, waiting to enter the resort, reached an estimated 25,000 people. Within the first day, the resort had received more than 80,000 visitors.
The property included 3,005 hotel rooms, a casino, and high-end shops and restaurants. The resort&#x27;s main attraction was an 8.5-acre man-made lake, featuring a water show known as Fountains of Bellagio. Other attractions included a conservatory and the $285 million Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. More than half of the resort&#x27;s revenue was expected to come from non-gaming amenities. Bellagio employed 9,500 people, 3,200 of them coming from other properties also owned by Mirage Resorts. Casino executive Bobby Baldwin served as the resort&#x27;s president.

Bellagio received positive reception. The level of luxury would eventually inspire other Las Vegas resorts to become more upscale. Las Vegas developer Irwin Molasky said, &quot;In our lifetime we will never see another building or hotel with such beauty and grace&quot;. Brian Greenspun of the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; said the opening &quot;by all accounts, was a first for Las Vegas&quot;, stating that the resort exceeded expectations. The newspaper&#x27;s Steve Friess later called the opening a &quot;pivotal&quot; turning point in Las Vegas history: &quot;The opening of a genuine luxury resort with great food, shopping and amenities was the most important step toward saying to the world, &#x27;Vegas isn&#x27;t tacky anymore&#x27;&quot;. Residents of the Bellagio village reportedly found few similarities with the resort.

===Ownership changes and expansion===

When it opened, Bellagio&#x27;s room rates averaged $200 a night, compared to $81 for most other Strip resorts. Early revenue was less than expected, with the resort making $260 million in cash flow during 1999, more than $40 million short of Wynn&#x27;s predictions. Plans for a 1,300-room addition were put on hold in March 2000, while Mirage Resorts finalized a merger with MGM Grand Inc. The deal closed in May 2000, giving MGM Grand ownership of Bellagio. Wynn was not upset with the sale: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been someone who focuses on the next project. The only part I ever enjoyed was the building, the design. I&#x27;ve always been the design guy&quot;. The company changed its name to MGM Mirage later that year, and Bellagio&#x27;s cash flow improved under the new ownership, prompting reconsideration of the hotel expansion plan.

Plans for a second tower were confirmed in August 2002, as part of a $375 million expansion. The new Spa Tower would be built south of the main tower and would offer access to the spa. The expansion would also include an additional spa, salon, meeting and retail space, as well as a new restaurant. Marnell Corrao Associates returned as general contractor. Construction on the Spa Tower began in April 2003. It was topped off a year later, and opened on December 23, 2004. It added 928 rooms, for a total of 3,933. Convention space was also increased to . The resort hired 1,400 new employees for the expanded facilities, bringing the total to 10,000.

By 2004, Bellagio was the most profitable hotel-casino in Las Vegas. In 2012, MGM and Suning Real Estate announced plans to expand the Bellagio name with a 200-room hotel in Shanghai, which eventually opened in 2018. Twenty years after its opening, the Bellagio remained one of the most popular resorts on the Las Vegas Strip.

In October 2019, MGM Resorts announced it would sell Bellagio to Blackstone Inc. for $4.25 billion. Through the deal, the two companies would form a joint venture that would lease Bellagio back to MGM Resorts for an annual rent of $245 million. The sale was completed in November 2019. Under the deal, MGM acquired a five-percent ownership stake in the venture and continued to operate the resort through the lease.

In July 2023, MGM Resorts announced an agreement with Marriott International to bring its properties within Marriott&#x27;s international reservations system and its Bonvoy loyalty program. The new partnership, which began in 2024, has Bellagio marketed within The Luxury Collection division of Marriott as Bellagio, a Luxury Collection Resort &amp; Casino, Las Vegas. In August 2023, Blackstone sold a 21.9-percent stake in the resort to Realty Income for $950 million.

==Incidents==

===Power outages===
A resort-wide power outage occurred around 2:00 a.m. on April 11, 2004, leaving only emergency lights still working. One of the main power lines was compromised, which led to the failure of other lines, resulting in the outage. Power had to be shut down completely so that thousands of feet of cable could be replaced. Guests were relocated to other hotels. The hotel and casino reopened on April 14, 2004, and other areas of the resort were reopened over the next few days. A preliminary investigation by the county found that the main power line failed because of premature deterioration, the cause for which remained unknown.

A partial power outage occurred on December 31, 2011, shutting down the resort&#x27;s buffet and several hundred hotel rooms in the main tower&#x27;s west wing. Another partial outage occurred in March 2018, after leaking water made contact with an electrical panel. The six-hour outage affected the buffet, a performance theater, parts of the sportsbook, and certain elevators.

===Robberies===
Several robberies have occurred at the Bellagio. In June 2000, three men stole $160,000 in cash and casino chips, and were subsequently apprehended. The Bellagio heist was one in a series of casino robberies committed by the men.

In December 2010, a helmet-wearing man robbed $1.5 million in chips from a craps table, with some chips worth $25,000 each. Confidential safeguards made it unlikely that the thief would be able to cash in the chips without getting caught. Furthermore, MGM announced after the robbery that it would discontinue the $25,000 chips within four months. The thief, son of a Las Vegas judge, was arrested in February 2011, after arranging to sell $25,000 chips to an undercover police officer. Approximately $793,000 in chips remained unaccounted for, most of them $25,000 chips. The robber pled guilty as part of a plea deal, and was sentenced to 3 to 11 years.

In July 2014, a man robbed the cashier cage of $43,500, using a BB gun. He was arrested the next day, after spending roughly half of the money on prostitutes and a shopping spree. He was found incompetent to stand trial.

On an early morning in March 2017, men wearing animal-themed masks broke into a jewelry store at the resort, prompting a police lockdown of the casino and parking garage. One of the suspects was apprehended, while three others remained at large.

Another robbery occurred later in 2017, when a man stole money from a poker cage. He returned to rob the cage in March 2019, and a shootout occurred outside the resort between him and police as he tried to escape. He was shot and killed.

===Fires===
On the morning of September 23, 2008, a mattress fire prompted the brief evacuation of the 26th floor, as well as portions of the 25th and 27th floors. One guest suffered minor burns, and others were treated for smoke inhalation and released shortly afterwards.

On the night of April 13, 2017, the roof of the resort&#x27;s retail section caught fire, forcing an evacuation of the area. The rest of the resort was unaffected, and the fire was put out within a half-hour. It caused up to $450,000 in damage, mostly above a Starbucks. The fire was caused by a faulty exterior light fixture.

==Amenities==
===Casino===

Bellagio&#x27;s casino is . Upon opening, it included 2,700 slot machines and 173 table games. Signage above slot machines was kept to a minimum, as Wynn wanted the resort&#x27;s architecture to be the primary focus. As of 2003, gaming made up less than half of the resort&#x27;s revenue. The poker room was expanded in 2004, as the game saw a rise in popularity.

The casino includes a high-limit poker area, originally known as Bobby&#x27;s Room. It was named after Bellagio president and longtime MGM executive Bobby Baldwin. As of 2018, the minimum buy-in was $20,000. It was the most popular high-limit poker room in Las Vegas, until the nearby Aria resort opened in 2009. The Aria&#x27;s poker room offered players a high-end alternative to Bobby&#x27;s Room. In October 2020, MGM quietly renamed it the Legends Room, two years after Baldwin left the company.

In 2002, the casino launched a poker tournament series. The casino also hosts the annual WPT Five Diamond World Poker Classic, and the Five-Star World Poker Classic.

In 2013, the Bellagio introduced a private casino room known as Villa Privé, reserved for high rollers.

===Hotel===

The Bellagio hotel has 3,933 rooms. It originally opened with 3,005 rooms, including 401 suites. A renovation of the main tower rooms took place in 2003. The Spa Tower, finished a year later, added 928 rooms, bringing the resort to its current number. The original tower is 36 stories, while the Spa Tower contains 33.

The hotel&#x27;s suites, as well as the rooms in the Spa Tower, were renovated in 2007. Rooms in the main tower received a six-month, $70 million renovation in 2011. A $40 million renovation of the Spa Tower rooms began in 2012 and concluded the following year. From 2014 to 2015, renovations took place on the main tower suites. It was the final phase of the $165 million remodeling project that began in 2011. Another renovation of the main tower rooms took place during 2021, and a $110 million renovation of the Spa Tower is scheduled for completion by October 2023.

The Chairman Suite includes an indoor garden, a home theater system, several fireplaces, a bar, and fulltime butler service.

A restored 19th century fountain sits in the hotel lobby, near the Conservatory. In 2015, a sculpture representing Earth&#x27;s elements was placed outside the main hotel entrance. It was created by artist Masatoshi Izumi, who hand-carved it out of four basalt stones, each one weighing at least 17,000 pounds.

===Nightclubs and bars===
An upscale nightclub, known as Light, was opened in December 2001. It was owned by Chris and Keith Barish, along with partner Andrew Sasson. It was inspired by a New York nightclub of the same name. The Las Vegas location became popular among celebrities. Light closed in September 2007, and was replaced by a new upscale nightclub known as The Bank. It was operated by Sasson&#x27;s company, The Light Group. The club included two bars and three resident DJs. It was popular among tourists, and also attracted locals with various promotions and contests. It eventually closed in 2018.

In March 2011, SBE Entertainment Group announced that it would bring its Hyde Lounge nightclub brand to the resort, taking the place of Fontana Bar. Hyde Bellagio opened on December 31, 2011. The space featured 40 tables and capacity for 714 people. It included outdoor seating overlooking the resort&#x27;s fountains. Hyde Bellagio closed in July 2019, and was replaced by the Mayfair Supper Club.

In February 2012, The Light Group opened Lily Bar &amp; Lounge, which also served as a nightclub. The resort&#x27;s bars are served by a pump room containing 1,800 bottles of alcohol. The alcohol travels distances ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 feet before reaching any one of the resort&#x27;s 53 bars.

=== Restaurants ===
Bellagio opened with 16 eateries, some of them overseen by award-winning chefs. Picasso is a French restaurant by chef Julian Serrano. Paintings by Pablo Picasso adorn the restaurant&#x27;s walls. Chef Todd English opened Olives, which served Mediterranean food and was named after a popular restaurant he opened in Boston. The resort also included Circo and Le Cirque, both owned by the Maccioni family and inspired by New York restaurants of the same name. Circo was an Italian restaurant, while Le Cirque offers French food and features an upscale circus theme.

Other restaurants included the 500-seat Buffet at Bellagio; Prime, a steakhouse by chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten; Aqua, a 150-seat seafood restaurant originally from San Francisco, overseen by chef Michael Mina; and the 24-hour Bellagio Cafe. Several restaurants included patios overlooking the Bellagio lake.
In 2004, Aqua was renamed Michael Mina after its chef. A new restaurant, Sensi, opened later that year as part of the Spa Tower. Jean-Philippe Maury also opened a pâtisserie which includes the world&#x27;s largest chocolate fountain, standing 27 feet.

Fifteen years after the resort&#x27;s opening, most of the original restaurants remained popular. Circo closed in 2014, and was replaced a year later by Lago, a new restaurant from chef Serrano. The restaurant serves Italian food, and features an Italian Futurism design. Snacks, a popular eatery among gamblers, was remodeled in 2015.

Chef Roy Ellamar began overseeing Sensi in 2011. The restaurant closed in 2015, and was replaced by Ellamar&#x27;s new restaurant Harvest, a health-conscious eatery with an emphasis on fresh ingredients. Olives closed in early 2018, and was replaced by Spago, a restaurant by Wolfgang Puck. Sadelle&#x27;s, a popular Manhattan restaurant, opened a Las Vegas location at the Bellagio in 2019, replacing the cafe.

The Mayfair Supper Club, a restaurant offering live entertainment, opened on December 31, 2019. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains. Le Cirque closed in March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and eventually reopened in October 2021.

The resort includes an employee dining hall known as Mangia, which functions as a buffet and feeds thousands of workers daily. An herb garden, located on the Bellagio&#x27;s roof, supplies some of the resort&#x27;s restaurants.

===Retail===
Since its opening, the resort has included a high-end retail area known as Via Bellagio. Retailers include Armani, Chanel, Fred Leighton, Gucci, Hermès, Prada, and Tiffany &amp; Co. It was the first time that such retailers had opened in Las Vegas, as Via Bellagio was the city&#x27;s first retail center focused on luxury brands. Additional retail space was added in the 2004 expansion.

==Attractions==

===Fountains of Bellagio===
Fountains of Bellagio is a free musical fountain show performed in the resort&#x27;s 8.5-acre lake. Each show is choreographed to a specific song or track, coming from a variety of musical genres. The fountains dance along to match the rhythm of the music, and water shoots as high as 460 feet. The fountains are a popular attraction, and among the most photographed places in the United States. Stages are occasionally built on the lake to host events, such as musical performances and a portion of the 2022 NFL draft. The Bellagio has hosted over 240,000 fountain shows as of October 2018.

The Fountains of Bellagio have experienced interruptions throughout their operation. These include a three-day power outage in 2004 and a temporary closure in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Technical problems have rarely caused cancellations, with only five reported by 2005. In 2012, based on tourist reviews, TripAdvisor recognized the Fountains of Bellagio as one of the &quot;most talked about attractions&quot; globally. It was one of 16 attractions featured on the list. TripAdvisor&#x27;s 2013 Travelers&#x27; Choice awards bestowed high honors upon the Fountains of Bellagio, naming it the top tourist attraction in the U.S. and placing it among the top 12 globally.

===Conservatory and botanical gardens===

The resort contains a conservatory and botanical gardens. It is located next to the hotel&#x27;s lobby and is open free to the public. It receives an average of 20,000 visitors daily. The Conservatory was originally planned as an outdoor garden.

There are five seasonal themes that the Conservatory undergoes: Chinese New Year, spring, summer, fall, and winter. From January to mid-March, the Conservatory celebrates the Chinese New Year with a display dominated by flowers bromeliads and orchids, as well as the animal of that particular year that the Chinese zodiac celebrates. The theme then changes over to the spring display, which lasts until May, and usually features a butterfly house as well as many varieties of tropical flowers.
During Memorial Day weekend, Bellagio then switches over to its all-American summer display, featuring a large recreation of the Liberty Bell, as well as several American flags throughout the Conservatory. The summer display is usually very patriotic featuring a lot of red, white, and blue, and is dominated by hydrangeas. From late September until Thanksgiving weekend, the Conservatory puts on its autumn display featuring several varieties of chrysanthemum and several large pumpkins. After Thanksgiving, the Conservatory switches to its winter holiday display, which is dominated by a large centerpiece Christmas Tree and several varieties of poinsettia. A life-sized candy village, which took months to create, was introduced for the 2012 Christmas display. Throughout the year, the colorful displays are decorated with many fragrant flowers and usually contain fountains.

Each seasonal display costs about $1 million to create. Props are put into storage for future use. Planning for each season is done in advance, and each display design is carried out by more than 100 workers over the course of several days. The Conservatory uses thousands of plants and flowers for its displays each year. As of 2018, the Conservatory had used six million plants across 100 displays, and had received 150 million visitors. In 2022, the resort introduced the Garden Table, a dining experience with seating alongside the conservatory attractions.

===Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art===

In addition to the numerous works of art found throughout the public areas of the resort, the property also includes the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art. It opened along with the resort, originally to showcase art from Wynn&#x27;s private collection, as well as art owned by Mirage Resorts. Following the property&#x27;s ownership change in 2000, the gallery became a rotating exhibition space, hosting art collections loaned from museums.

===&quot;Fiori di Como&quot;===
A large art piece hangs from the ceiling of the hotel lobby, measuring approximately and representing flowers of various colors. It is a popular attraction and free to view. Known as &quot;Fiori di Como&quot; (&quot;Flowers of Como&quot;), it was created by glass artist Dale Chihuly. Wynn hired him to create an art piece for the resort, but it would take six months before they settled on an idea. According to Wynn&#x27;s wife Elaine, &quot;We went over to Dale&#x27;s house where he had put a glass art installation at the bottom of his lap pool. And I said to him, &#x27;I want that in my ceiling in the Bellagio lobby.&#x27; So that&#x27;s how we got that&quot;.

A total of two years was spent working on &quot;Fiori di Como&quot;, which turned out larger than Chihuly had anticipated: &quot;Every time, Steve (Wynn) saw it, he wanted more&quot;. Because the sculpture would hang in Las Vegas, Chihuly took a less-restrained approach in creating it: &quot;I thought it would be a good opportunity to use a lot of color. I thought I could be a little bit more exuberant&quot;. Metal oxides were used during the glass-making process to give the sculpture its colors. &quot;Fiori di Como&quot; includes more than 2,100 pieces of colored glass. The sculpture measures 65 feet by 29 feet, and weighs more than 40,000 pounds. It is supported by a 10,000-pound steel armature.

&quot;Fiori di Como&quot; is the world&#x27;s largest glass sculpture, and it popularized Chihuly among the general public. The cost to create the sculpture has never been revealed, although it reportedly ranges from $1 million to $10 million. As of 2017, it is estimated to be worth at least $8 million. &quot;Fiori di Como&quot; garnered positive feedback from guests, prompting Chihuly and the Bellagio to partner up and open a store in 2001, in the resort&#x27;s Conservatory. The store sold artwork by Chihuly, including individual flower-shaped art pieces inspired by &quot;Fiori di Como&quot;. Other items included books and videos about Chihuly.

==Live entertainment==

Wynn hired talent manager Sandy Gallin to oversee live entertainment at the resort. Upon opening, the casino included several performance venues, such as the 250-seat Fontana lounge, and the 70-seat Allegro lounge. Early on, the Fontana hosted acts such as Michael Feinstein and Loston Harris.

Since the Bellagio opened, it has featured Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s water-themed show &quot;O&quot;. It is performed in an 1,800-seat opera house, and makes use of a mini lake which serves as the stage. The show was created at a cost of approximately $100 million, making it the most expensive in Las Vegas history up to that point.

&quot;Cheval&quot;, a horse-themed show, was performed in a tent next to the resort in the early 2000s. It was created by Gilles Ste-Croix, who helped create &quot;O&quot;.

==Accolades==
Bellagio is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World, and various organizations have ranked the resort highly. By 2001, it had achieved a four-star rating from Mobil Travel Guide. That year, it became the first hotel-casino to win the AAA Five Diamond Award. It was also the second Las Vegas hotel to win the award, after the Four Seasons in 1999. In 2010, Bellagio won its 10th consecutive Five Diamond Award, the first Strip resort to do so. As of 2020, it had won the Five Diamond Award 18 consecutive times.

Bellagio placed eighth in the 2003 Zagat Survey of U.S. hotel resorts, while its restaurants ranked 12th in the category of top dining. Bellagio has also made the &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; Gold List numerous times, beginning in 2005. A 2005 study by Majestic Research, polling more than 400 out-of-state residents, found Bellagio to be the favorite resort among tourists, with 18 percent support. Another study polled tourists who visited Las Vegas in 2005, and Bellagio was named the city&#x27;s top &quot;must-see&quot; resort, while the fountains were named best &quot;must-see&quot; attraction. In 2010, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; ranked it 31st on a list of top hotels in large U.S. and Canadian cities. Travelocity ranked it in sixth place in a 2011 list of top 10 Las Vegas hotels, based on guest reviews.

The resort&#x27;s Picasso restaurant has also been critically acclaimed, receiving the AAA Five Diamond and Mobil Five-Star awards by the end of 2001. In 2010, the restaurant won its 10th Five Diamond Award, while Le Cirque won its 8th. Bellagio was the only hotel in the U.S. to have two Five Diamond restaurants.

==In popular culture==

Bellagio serves as the central setting for the 2001 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, in which a group of thieves conspire to rob its vault. The film features various areas of the property. A staircase descended by character Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) would later be removed to make way for the Spa Tower.

The Bellagio is depicted in the 2007 film &quot;Lucky You&quot;. The film is set in 2003, but the resort&#x27;s poker room had been renovated since then, prompting the filmmakers to construct a replica of the original room on a soundstage in Los Angeles.

The resort&#x27;s fountains have appeared in numerous films.

<text>Bansko ( ) is a town in southwestern Bulgaria, located in Blagoevgrad Oblast near the city of Razlog. Once mainly a stockbreeding and travelling merchant community, the town is now an international centre for winter and summer tourism. More recently Bansko has become a known hotspot for digital nomads driven in part by the relative affordability of the location combined with its natural scenery.

Bansko lies at the foot of the Pirin Mountains, not far from the national park of the same name, in the valley of the Nestos River at an elevation of 925 meters above sea level. It is a ski resort. The city is about 160 km from Sofia and about 220 km from Thessaloniki.

Bansko is a stop on the narrow-gauge Septemvri–Dobrinishte narrow-gauge line from Septemvri to Dobrinishte. There are rail connections (changing in September) to Sofia, Plovdiv and Burgas. There are bus connections to Sofia, Plovdiv, Blagoevgrad, Razlog and Gotse Delchev.

The nearby village of Banya, located only from the town, is known for its 27 thermal mineral springs.

==Economy==
The mountain peaks near the town, the numerous lakes and the old pine woods make it a recreation destination. Bulgaria&#x27;s share in European winter tourism is steadily rising, and Bansko increasingly competes with resorts in France and Switzerland due to the comparatively lower costs.

Improvements to the infrastructure and organisation of the ski area on Todorka have been made annually to accommodate the rising number of tourists. A gondola lift was built from town in 2003, replacing the minibus ride to the primary base area of Banderishka Poliana. , the ski area has of ski runs, 14 lifts and drags, serving up to 24,500 persons per hour. The lift-served summit rises to an elevation of above sea level. The vertical drop is nearly to the base area at Banderishka Poliana, and over with the ski runs to town.

Nowadays Bansko is known as a destination for digital nomads. The influx of digital nomads, including many who have purchased property in the town are claimed to have contributing to stabilising the town&#x27;s property market and boosting the long-stay tourism in the town particularly outside the winter peak season. There are a growing number of coworking spaces in Bansko including Coworking Bansko is a community of Digital Nomads that has two co-working locations in the north and south part of the town. The annual Bansko Nomad Fest is believed to be one of the world&#x27;s largest event for digital nomads attracting 700 participants in 2023.

It hosted the men&#x27;s giant slalom in February 2012 and the FIS World Cup ladies&#x27; downhill and super G, and men&#x27;s giant slalom and slalom.

Alpine and biathlon competitions take place regularly. It is expected that the summer biathlon world cup will also take place in the resort of Bansko.

== Religion ==

The church &quot;Sveta Troitsa&quot; (Holy Trinity) is an Orthodox Christian church, part of Bulgarian Orthodox Church. It was built by the people of Bansko in 1835.

==Events==

The town is the location for an annual jazz event, the Bansko Jazz Festival, and also the annual Bansko pop-star concert. In March, the town hosts the British underground dance fete Horizon Festival. This town held the International Linguistics Olympiad in 2023.

<text>A sliotar ( , ) or sliothar is a hard solid sphere slightly larger than a tennis ball, consisting of a cork core covered by two pieces of leather stitched together. Sometimes called a &quot;hurling ball&quot;, it resembles a baseball with more pronounced stitching. It is used in the Gaelic games of hurling, camogie, rounders and shinty.

==Dimensions==
An official Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) sliotar, as used in top level hurling competitions such as the National Hurling League or the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championships is subject to strict regulations as regards its size, mass and composition.

The following regulations apply:
* The diameter is between not including the rib
* The mass is between 
* The rib height is between 2 mm and 2.8 mm, and width between 3.6 mm and 5.4 mm
* The leather cover can be between 1.8 mm and 2.7 mm and is laminated with a coating of no more than 0.15 mm

Approved sliotars carry a GAA mark of approval. The GAA maintains a list of approved suppliers, based on manufacturers who pass their inspection.

==History==
Early (pre-GAA) sliotars used various materials, depending on the part of the country, including combinations of wood, leather, rope and animal hair and even hollow bronze. 

The etymology is uncertain, with some connecting it to &quot;sliabh&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;) and &quot;thar&quot; (&quot;across&quot;), after Cúchulainn&#x27;s story of hitting a silver ball across a mountain. An archaic Irish name for a hurling-ball, used on the Aran Islands as well as elsewhere, was &quot;&quot;; the term also means &quot;, peg, skein of thread,&quot; indicating the ball&#x27;s shape and nature. The term &quot;sliotar&quot; is not recorded until Dinneen&#x27;s 1927 dictionary, where it is said to mean &quot;a good quantity, as of food at a meal, a hurley-ball;&quot; prior to that time, the name &quot;hurley ball&quot; or &quot;hurling ball&quot; was generally used.

In the early years of the GAA, there was no specific standard for the size or weight of sliotars. The man credited with initial standardisation of the sliotar is Ned Treston (1862–1949) of Gort, County Galway. He was selected to play in a match between South Galway and North Tipperary in February 1886 in Dublin. Prior the game, there was debate between the teams as regards the size of the sliotar. Treston made a sliotar at a nearby saddler, which was used in the game, and went on to be a prototype for subsequent sliotars.

Johnny McAuliffe (1896–1960) of County Limerick is credited with the modern design. Before his improvements the ball tended to be inconsistent due to poor manufacturing. It was also heavier than modern sliotars (over 200g), and due to being made partly with horse-hair, tended to lose shape during play, and become soggy in wet conditions. The brown colour also meant that the ball was difficult to see in some conditions. McAuliffe&#x27;s changes introduced a cork core, with a 2 piece white-tanned leather covering as the standard materials. These changes led to a harder wearing ball, which was water resistant and easier to see. The construction materials also meant that the ball was only about half as heavy as Treston&#x27;s version.

In the early 2000s, the GAA experimented with using sliotars with rubber rather than cork cores; however, it was found that using a rubber core led to a more unpredictable bounce, and moved a lot faster than a ball with a cork core, especially in wet conditions. It was decided to return to a cork ball because of this. While different sized sliotars are used for different ages and codes (with, for example, senior camogie games using a &quot;size 4&quot; sliotar, and senior hurling a &quot;size 5&quot; ball), some claims have historically been made of non-standard balls being used to gain a perceived advantage in competition.

A yellow sliotar was introduced for the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (the Liam MacCarthy Cup only). This change caused minor controversy as some players believed the yellow sliotar was inferior to the standard white sliotar.

<text>Judson Dance Theater was a collective of dancers, composers, and visual artists who performed at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, Manhattan New York City between 1962 and 1964. The artists involved were avant garde experimentalists who rejected the confines of Modern dance practice and theory, inventing as they did the precepts of Postmodern dance.

== History ==
Judson Dance Theater grew out of a composition class held at Merce Cunningham&#x27;s studio, taught by Robert Dunn, a musician who had studied experimental music theory with John Cage. &quot;A Concert of Dance&quot;, the first Judson concert, took place on July 6, 1962, and included the work of 14 choreographers performed by 17 people, some of whom were students in the Dunn composition class. Other performers in the concert were members of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, as well as visual artists, filmmakers, and composers. The concert included works by Yvonne Rainer, Steve Paxton, David Gordon, Alex and Deborah Hay, Fred Herko, Elaine Summers, William Davis, and Ruth Emerson.

Beginning in the Fall of 1962, the group held weekly workshops at which they performed and received critiques. These meetings were held first at Yvonne Rainer&#x27;s studio, then at the Judson Memorial Church. Throughout the next two years, nearly two hundred works were presented by the collective. The name Judson Dance Theater was adopted in April 1963. Members also independently participated in performance and multimedia art installations, or &quot;Happenings&quot;, which took place around the city at that time.

American artists notable for their contributions or influence to the Judson Dance Theater were painter Robert Rauschenberg, conceptual artists Robert Morris and Andy Warhol, and composer John Herbert McDowell. Choreographers who influenced the group included Merce Cunningham, Simone Forti, Anna Halprin, and James Waring, among others.

== Artistic philosophy ==
Yvonne Rainer&#x27;s &quot;No Manifesto&quot;, in which she rejects any confines to technique, thrill, spectacle, glamour, or assumed space, is a prime example of many of the artistic intentions of the cooperative: a rejection of spectacular, virtuosic, narrative, and expressive choreographic approaches. The collective was a place for collaboration between artists in fields such as, dance, writing, film, music and multi-media.

Although the collective remained in an undefined state, certain recurring themes and methods emerged from the work at Judson Dance Theater. Democratic structures, improvisational methods, and a focus on process rather than product defined the group’s identity. Drawing inspiration from everyday actions like walking and sitting, the artists aimed to dissolve the line between art and daily life. Ordinary gestures pursued a straightforward, unembellished rapport with their audience, using simplicity to emphasize the authenticity of their movements. The Judson Dance Theater’s aesthetic was “never monolithic; it was deliberately undefined and unrestricted.” 

Yvonne Rainer’s Trio A, welcomed &quot;anyone who wanted to learn it, skilled and unskilled, trained and untrained, professional and amateur&quot;. By making Trio A available to anyone interested, Rainer questioned the exclusivity of traditional dance and reflected Judson’s inclusive, experimental attitude. This gesture suggested a new perspective on dance training, emphasizing the value of participation and accessibility. Rainer’s openness to teaching Trio A to a wide audience highlighted Judson’s emphasis on experimentation over perfection, fostering an inclusive atmosphere that aligned with the era’s social and political climate. 

The collective nature of Judson further distinguished it from many other dance companies of the time, which tended to center on the vision of a single artistic director. Judson’s democratic structure encouraged shared authority and collaboration, with each artist contributing unique ideas. This approach allowed artists to exist as collaborators and experiments without strict adherence to a singular aesthetic or hierarchy. Judson at its core questioned the traditional role of the choreographer as the central voice in dance works and instead valued communal methods to create work.

Judson Dance Theater’s practices around democratic structures, improvisation, and the use of untrained performers contributed to a broader rethinking of dance’s boundaries. By prioritizing process and integrating everyday movement, Judson artists prompted reflections on accessibility, collaboration, and the role of art in everyday life. These early experiments remain significant in understanding the evolution of contemporary dance and performance practices.

== Legacy ==
In 1964 when the company performances ceased, the legacy of the group continued as individual members continued to create work that upheld the group&#x27;s fundamental philosophies. For instance, James Waring and his dancers continued presenting work, as well as original members and second generation Judson performers. Perhaps the most influential aspect of Judson&#x27;s legacy was not the work they produced, but the lens through which they regarded their work, which promoted the concept that anything could be looked at as dance.

In 2012, 50 years after the first Judson Dance Theater performance, Danspace Project presented the series &quot;Platform 2012: Judson Now&quot;, which featured &quot;work by Judson-era artists reflecting their current artistic interests and includ[ing] artists who influenced Judson pre-1962 and contemporary artists who claim Judson as a direct point of reference.&quot; In 2018, the Museum of Modern Art mounted a retrospective exhibition, &quot;Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done&quot;, which included the work of Yvonne Rainer, Deborah Hay, David Gordon, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton, and Trisha Brown, among others.

<doc id="693758" wikidata="Q5069591" url="?curid=693758" title="Chamberlain Square">
<text>Chamberlain Square or Chamberlain Place is a public square in central Birmingham, England, named after statesman and notable mayor of Birmingham, Joseph Chamberlain. The Victorian square was drastically remodelled in the 1970s, with most of the Victorian buildings demolished and the construction of the Brutalist Central Library. Re-landscaping occurred most recently when the square was closed to the public for five years until March 2021 for remodelling as part of the Paradise scheme.

Its features include:
*Chamberlain Memorial
*Birmingham Council House (side elevation)
*Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery
*Birmingham Town Hall
*One and Two Chamberlain Square

==Statues and monuments==
*Chamberlain Memorial – In honour of the public service Joseph Chamberlain gave to the city of Birmingham, the memorial fountain was unveiled in his presence on 10 October 1880 as the centrepiece of the new public square. The high memorial was designed by John Henry Chamberlain (no relation).
* Statue of Joseph Priestley, which was originally located in Victoria Square (then called Council House Square).
* Statue of James Watt, which was originally located on Paradise Street next to the Town Hall.
* Statue of Thomas Attwood by Sioban Coppinger and Fiona Peever, 1993. The bronze statue sits, having left his plinth, and scattered his bronze pages, on the steps.

The annual Birmingham Christmas Craft Fair is held in Chamberlain Square from the third Friday in November to 23 December. The event began in 1997 as &quot;Winterval&quot;, held from 20 November to 31 December, with the intention of attracting business into Birmingham&#x27;s newly rejuvenated city centre.

Chamberlain Square was the original site of Birmingham&#x27;s BBC Big Screen, where it was situated until September 2007.

==Paradise Circus development==
As part of the Paradise Circus development by Argent Group the square was re-landscaped and surrounding buildings demolished including the brutalist Birmingham Central Library and Paradise Forum (beneath the former reference library). In 2014 landscape architects, Grant Associates were awarded the contract to design the new public realm. The square reopened in March 2021 as the final part of the first phase of the £700m Paradise scheme following its closure in November 2015, the square was transformed with new paving, steps and lighting. Two commercial buildings, One Chamberlain Square and Two Chamberlain Square, totalling 350,000 sq ft of space, now face onto the square and form the commercial part of Phase One of Paradise.

<doc id="693765" wikidata="Q4533139" url="?curid=693765" title="Thomas Attwood (economist)">
<text>Thomas Attwood (6 October 1783 – 6 March 1856) was a British banker, economist, political campaigner and Member of Parliament. He was the leading figure of the underconsumptionist Birmingham School of economists, and, as the founder of the Birmingham Political Union, the leading figure in the public campaign for the Reform Act 1832.

==Life and career==
Thomas Attwood was born in Halesowen, then a detached part of Shropshire, and attended Halesowen Grammar School (now Earls High School) before being moved to Wolverhampton Grammar School. On 12 May 1806, Attwood married Elizabeth Carless from Lower Ravenhurst Farm, an area which is now part of the Moor Pool estate. They had two sons, George de Bosco Attwood (15 March 1808), who stood unsuccessfully for the Walsall constituency in the 1832 general election, and Thomas Aurelius Attwood (4 March 1810). Their daughter Angela married Daniel Wakefield with whom she emigrated to New Zealand.

He founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1830. This was a political organization campaigning for cities, and large towns such as Birmingham, to be directly represented in Parliament. The Birmingham Political Union was foremost among groups lobbying the government for the passage of a Reform Bill to achieve this aim. The Days of May in 1832 brought the people&#x27;s struggle for wider enfranchisement to a head, and the Great Reform Act was passed on 15 May 1832. After this success he became one of the first two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Birmingham (along with Joshua Scholefield) on 12 December 1832, a position he held until 1839.

Attwood lived at The Grove, a Georgian house in Harborne, Birmingham, between 1823 and 1846. He died in Malvern, Worcestershire in 1856.

==Memorials==

A grade II listed statue of Thomas Attwood by local sculptor Peter Hollins stood in Calthorpe Park from 1859 to 1974 then moved to Larches Green, Sparkbrook, Birmingham between 1974 and 2008, but is now in store. A 1993 bronze statue sat, having left his plinth, and scattered his bronze pages, on the steps of Chamberlain Square in Birmingham until 2016 when works to demolish the Central Library and rebuild Chamberlain Square began. The statue was reinstalled in 2020 once the works were completed.

Attwood Street, a residential street in Halesowen, commemorates his achievements.

<text>Gindibu (Akkadian: ; ) was a Qedarite Arab king.

==Reign==
===Background===
Gindibu ruled over an Arab kingdom located in the northeastern parts of present-day Jordan, on the eastern borders of the Assyrian province of Haurina (Hauran) established by Tiglath-Pileser III in 732 BC. The kingdom spanned the Azraq oasis and Wadi Sirhan, and was bordered by the powerful kingdoms of Aram-Damascus and Israel in the west, although Gindibu himself was independent of Damascene hegemony.

===Battle of Qarqar===
Although Gindibu&#x27;s kingdom was not on the Assyrian campaign routes and therefore was not in danger of being attacked by the Assyrians, the rise of Neo-Assyrian power in the 9th century BCE meant that the desert and border routes where Gindibu had economic interests were under threat of Assyrian interference, due to which he allied with his powerful neighbours, the kings Bar-Hadad II of Aram-Damascus and Ahab of Israel, against the Assyrian Empire. Fearing disruptions by the Assyrians, Gindibu led 1000 camelry troops at the battle of Battle of Qarqar in 853 BCE on the side of the alliance led by Aram-Damascus and Israel against Shalmaneser III of Assyria.

===Aftermath===
Shalmaneser III later campaigned to Damascus and Mount Ḥawrān in 841 BCE, but his inscriptions mentioned neither the Qedarite kingdom nor Gindibu himself or any successor of his. The Qedarites were not mentioned either in the list of rulers, including those of distant places such as Philistia, Edom, and Israel, who paid tribute to Adad-nirari III after the latter&#x27;s defeat of Ben-Hadad III of Damascus in 796 BCE. This reason for absence from the Assyrian records is that the kingdom of Gindibu was far from the campaign routes of the Assyrians during the later 9th century BCE.

<text>Paul Hogan (born 8 October 1939) is an Australian actor and comedian. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance as outback adventurer Michael &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee in &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), the first in the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; film series. 

== Early life ==
At the start of his career, Paul Hogan said he was born in Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, to appear more interesting. He was actually born in Parramatta, a suburb in Greater Western Sydney, and he is of Irish descent.

He moved to Granville in Western Sydney at a young age and worked as a rigger on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. He attended both Primary and High School at Parramatta Marist High School.

== Career ==
Hogan&#x27;s first public appearance was on Australian television, the Nine Network&#x27;s amateur talent program &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1971. Hogan had observed to his Harbour Bridge workmates that the program&#x27;s entertainment value relied significantly on the judges ridiculing and belittling the performers, and suggested the judges deserved similar treatment. Hogan inveigled his way onto the program by claiming to be a &quot;tap-dancing knife-thrower&quot;. Hogan appeared on stage in his work boots, holding elaborate prop &quot;knives&quot;, and proceeded to make a series of jokes at the judges&#x27; expense; he finished by performing a rudimentary shuffle and throwing the knives onto the floor. Strong positive response from the viewing public saw Hogan invited back for repeated performances on &quot;New Faces&quot;; in another of these, he proposed to &quot;play the shovels&quot;, which consisted of making a series of jokes before banging two shovels together a few times. Hogan&#x27;s natural ability as a comedic performer attracted the attention of Mike Willesee, host of Nine&#x27;s news magazine program &quot;A Current Affair&quot;. Willesee offered Hogan regular appearances on the series, during which Hogan would make humorous comment on some issue of the day. During this time, Hogan befriended &quot;A Current Affair&quot; producer John Cornell, who became Hogan&#x27;s manager and business partner.

Hogan followed this with his own comedy sketch program &quot;The Paul Hogan Show&quot;, which he produced and wrote, and in which he played characters with Cornell and Delvene Delaney. The series, which ran for 60 episodes between 1973 and 1984, was popular in the UK, where it aired on the new Channel Four from 1982 and also in South Africa, and showcased his trademark light-hearted but laddish ocker humour. Hogan won the 1973 &quot;TV Week&quot; Logie Award for &#x27;Best New Talent&#x27;. The early series was on Channel Seven and, by 1975, it was screened on Channel Nine where it remained until the end of 1984.

In the 1970s, Hogan advertised Winfield cigarettes in television, print and billboard advertisements in which he wore a formal dinner suit. These ads always ended with the catchphrase &quot;Anyhow, have a Winfield.&quot; During the early 1980s, Hogan filmed a series of television ads promoting the Australian tourism industry, which aired in the United States. An advertisement with the phrase &quot;shrimp on the barbie&quot;, which aired from 1984, was particularly successful.

In 1985, Hogan appeared as an Australian World War I &#x27;digger&#x27; named Pat Cleary in the mini-series &quot;Anzacs&quot;, which aired on the Nine Network. Cleary was described as the quintessential Aussie larrikin, and series writer John Dixon wrote the part of Cleary with Hogan in mind. The series included a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of Australian television and film actors of the day, including Jon Blake, Andrew Clarke, Megan Williams, Tony Bonner, Bill Kerr, Ilona Rodgers, Vivean Gray and Robert Coleby.

Throughout the decade, Hogan appeared on British television in advertisements for Foster&#x27;s Lager, in which he played an earthy Australian abroad in London. The character&#x27;s most notable line (spoken incredulously at a ballet performance) &quot;Strewth, there&#x27;s a bloke down there with no strides on!&quot;, followed Hogan for years, and the popularity of its &quot;fish out of water&quot; humour was repeated with his next endeavour. In another advertisement from the same Foster&#x27;s series, Hogan&#x27;s character is approached in a London Tube station by a Japanese tourist who asks, &quot;Do you know the way to Cockfosters?&quot; (referring to an area in North London), to which Hogan replies (with a puzzled look on his face): &quot;Drink it warm, mate.&quot;

Hogan&#x27;s breakout role was that of Mick &quot;Crocodile&quot; Dundee in the 1986 film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;. Hogan also co-wrote the movie, which was a massive critical and commercial success in many countries. He won the 1987 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for Best Actor at the BAFTAs. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, a BAFTA and a Saturn Award. Along with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn, Hogan co-hosted the 59th Academy Awards, also in 1987. Hogan again portrayed Mick Dundee in the sequel &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;, released in 1988. Hogan was also executive producer and co-writer with his son, Brett. Although less popular with critics than the first &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, it was still a commercial success. The character made him popular in the United States, with phrases like, &quot;That&#x27;s not a knife... &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; a knife!&quot; entering the lexicon, though Hogan was troubled that the character was perceived as a cross between Chuck Norris and John Rambo, and turned down roles similar to those because of their violent nature, commenting:

In the early 1990s, a Paramount executive pitched a concept of a &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; crossover movie. Hogan refused the starring role in the hit film &quot;Ghost&quot;, choosing instead to make &quot;Almost an Angel&quot; (1990). In 1994, Hogan co-produced, wrote and starred in the Western comedy film &quot;Lightning Jack&quot;. In 1996, he starred in a remake of the 1963 film &quot;Flipper&quot;, a family-friendly movie about a dolphin. In 1998, he co-starred in the made-for-TV drama &quot;Floating Away&quot;, an adaptation of the Tim Sandlin book &quot;Sorrow Floats&quot;, and in which he played &#x27;Shane&#x27;, a recovering alcoholic.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Hogan was featured in advertisements for the Subaru Outback. In 2001, Hogan returned to the role that made him famous with &quot;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&quot;.

In 2004, Hogan starred in the Australian-produced comedy film &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot;, about two firemen pretending to be in a homosexual relationship for financial benefit. &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; was written and directed by Hogan&#x27;s friend Dean Murphy and was the highest-grossing Australian-made film of 2004. 2005 saw the release of &quot;Paul Hogan – Stand Up Hoges&quot;, a DVD compilation of Hogan&#x27;s favourite live performances throughout his career. In 2009, Hogan starred in another of Murphy&#x27;s films, &quot;Charlie &amp; Boots&quot;, a road-movie concerning the relationship between a father (Hogan) and son (Shane Jacobson). It was the second-highest-grossing Australian-made film of 2009, after &quot;Mao&#x27;s Last Dancer&quot;.

In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Hogan embarked on live stand-up performances throughout Australia. The 2013 tour entitled &quot;An Evening with Hoges&quot; featured capital cities only, but the 2014 tour &quot;Hoges: One Night Only&quot; featured 25 locations including regional Australia. 2015&#x27;s &quot;Hoges: Live&quot; saw performances in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney only. Some of this material was shown in the 2014 documentary &quot;Hanging with Hoges&quot;, in which Hogan was interviewed about his life and career by Jacobson.

In 2016, Hogan received the Longford Lyell Award for an outstanding contribution to the Australian screen. Hogan joked he had only ever been a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot;.

Australia&#x27;s Seven Network commissioned a two-part miniseries based upon Hogan&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;&quot; which aired in February 2017. Australian actor Josh Lawson portrayed Hogan. In 2019, to celebrate Hogan&#x27;s upcoming 80th birthday, Australia&#x27;s ABC produced a two-part episode of &quot;Australian Story&quot;, entitled &quot;A Fortunate Life – Paul Hogan&quot;, in which Hogan and his family reflect on his life and career.

Following on from a 2018 Tourism Australia campaign, in 2020 Hogan starred in &quot;The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee&quot;, with Hogan portraying himself as an aged, out-of-touch movie actor with his legendary character Mick Dundee now monetised and manipulated by others.

In 2023, Hogan took part in a live TV roast entitled &quot;The Roast of Paul Hogan&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hogan and his first wife, Noelene Edwards, married in 1958. They separated and divorced in 1981 and remarried less than one year later. A second divorce, initiated in 1986, was considered one of Australia&#x27;s ugliest celebrity divorces. Hogan married his &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; co-star Linda Kozlowski in 1990. He has five children with his first wife and one with his second wife. In October 2013, Kozlowski filed for divorce from Hogan, citing irreconcilable differences, with the divorce finalised in 2014.

Paul Hogan has five sons (Brett, Clay, Scott, Todd, and Chance) and one daughter (Lauren). 

Todd Hogan is the father of TV presenter Mylee Hogan and her brother Jake Hogan.

=== Tax problems ===

From February 2003 until all charges were dropped in November 2010, Hogan faced a series of legal issues while under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for tax evasion.

His legal troubles were made public in 2007 when Hogan was named as one of a group in connection to an AU$300 million Australian tax fraud investigation called Operation Wickenby, investigating 23 companies for allegedly using overseas companies to hide income. In July 2008, Hogan commented to Network Ten that he had &quot;paid plenty of tax&quot; in Australia and that he had nothing to fear from the ATO investigation.

In October 2008, Hogan scored a major victory in his tax fight with the Australian Crime Commission, who were forced to pay up to an estimated AU$5 million for legal bills dating back to 2006 and were required to return seized personal financial documents that they had admitted were irrelevant. Hogan had not been charged in connection with the investigation, which began in 2003.

On 18 June 2010, in the Australian High Court, Hogan lost a long-running legal battle to keep the contents of his tax documents secret, paving the way for details of his offshore accounts to be published. Earlier the same year, Australian media reported that the Australian Crime Commission was in the final stages of preparing to lay criminal charges of tax evasion against Hogan, film producer John Cornell and their accountant Anthony Stewart, who it suspected channelled millions of dollars from the proceeds of the film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; and other films into offshore tax havens. The release of the documents was expected to help finalise the Tax Office&#x27;s case.

On 20 August 2010, Hogan returned to Australia to attend his mother&#x27;s funeral. Upon arrival, he was issued a Departure Prohibition Order by the ATO, which prevented him from leaving the country until his alleged tax debt was paid or settled. The nation&#x27;s tax office said he owed taxes on AU$37.5 million of undeclared income. On 3 September, Hogan was granted permission to return to the U.S. through an agreement between his lawyers and Australian tax officials. Hogan continued to deny any wrongdoing.

In November 2010, the Australian Tax Office dropped its criminal investigation of Hogan and his business manager for tax evasion.

In January 2011, Hogan&#x27;s lawyer announced that Hogan was suing the Australian government, stating that Hogan&#x27;s &quot;earning potential and reputation has been decimated&quot;. Hogan likened the Australian Tax Office to the Taliban and referred to staff as &quot;a-holes&quot;.

In May 2012, it was announced that, following mediation before an ex–High Court judge, the entities settled with the Commissioner of Taxation in an agreement &quot;without admission&quot;. The parties agreed that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential, but as part of the settlement, the Departure Prohibition Order was revoked by the Commissioner. As of April 2013, Hogan&#x27;s financial advisor Stewart remained in a dispute with the Australian Tax Office.

Hogan reappeared in the media in April 2013, because of a AU$32.3 million issue with a Swiss bank run by the Geneva firm Strachans. Following the placement of the money in an offshore account for the purpose of tax avoidance, Hogan was unable to access the funds as of April 2013, and a United States court action by Hogan that sought AU$80 million in damages proved unsuccessful. Hogan publicly stated that he believes that Philip Egglishaw, the principal of Strachans and a former tax advisor to Hogan, had absconded with the money, and Hogan&#x27;s American legal representative Schuyler &quot;Sky&quot; Moore filed corresponding documents in a Californian court based on this statement. On 18 April 2013, it was reported that Egglishaw denied the allegations of his former client.

In May 2017, Chris Jordan, Commissioner of Taxation, implied that in spite of Hogan&#x27;s claim of victory over the ATO in 2012, Hogan paid &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; to settle the matter. In response, Hogan denied paying the ATO, and criticised Jordan for breaking the confidentiality clause of the 2012 agreement.

<text>Boa Vista (, literally &quot;Good View&quot;; figuratively &quot;Fairview&quot;) is the capital of the Brazilian state of Roraima. Situated on the western bank of the Branco River, the city lies from Brazil&#x27;s border with Venezuela. It is the only Brazilian state capital located entirely north of the equator.

Boa Vista is the most populous municipality in the state of Roraima; approximately half of the population of the state lives in the city. Commerce mostly occurs with Manaus, the capital of the State of Amazonas. Business also takes place between Boa Vista and with the cities of Lethem, in Guyana and Santa Elena de Uairén, in Venezuela. These two foreign cities are the only major cities that can be accessed from Boa Vista by road, although roads connect other smaller state municipalities with the capital city. Travel by airplane is the only means of transportation with other regions of the country.

As a modern city, Boa Vista stands out among the other capitals of the North Region of Brazil as it is a planned city with a radial plan. It was planned by the architect Darci Aleixo Derenusson who based his design for the city on one that is similar to that of Paris, France. The city was built under the direction of Captain Ene Garcez, the first governor of Roraima.

==History==
The municipality of Boa Vista formed the first urban area of the state of Roraima. The São Joaquim do Rio Branco Fort, founded in 1775, is located on the banks of the Uraricoera River about 32 km from the capital and is considered to be of great importance to the region.

The city was created on July 9, 1890, as Boa Vista do Rio Branco. It was founded by Augusto Villeroy (Amazonas&#x27;s Governor). The first mayor was João Capistrano da Silva Mota, also known as Coronel Mota. After the mayor, two councillors (José Francisco Coelho and José Gonzaga de Souza Junior) were appointed.

In 1943, during the middle of World War II, Boa Vista became the capital of the recently created Federal Territory of Rio Branco. The territory grew from mining operations in the area. The then Federal Territory of Rio Branco was elevated to statehood, later being renamed as &quot;Roraima&quot;. Later, machine-based mining was prohibited (because of the resulting damage to the landscape), which ended up hindering the economy of the state and the municipality.

In the 2010s, the crisis in Venezuela led to the population swelling by around 50,000 Venezuelan immigrants.

==Economy==

The GDP of the city was R$2,265,603,000 (2005).

The per capita income of the city was R$9,366 (2005).

==Education==

Portuguese is the official national language, and the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are part of the official high school curriculum.

Educational institutions include:
* Universidade Federal de Roraima (UFRR);
* Instituto Federal de Roraima (IFRR);
* Facudade Estácio Atual da Amazônia;
* Faculdades Cathedral – Boa Vista (Cathedral-Boa Vista);
* Faculdade de Teologia de Boa Vista (Fatebov)

==Tourism and recreation==

* Anaua Park, a major recreational park is located in Boa Vista. It is the biggest park in the north region of Brazil. It has a Forrodromo (show place), a square, a lake and a kart-racing facility. 
* Taumanam is a small artificial beach on Rio Branco. It has several stores and snack bars, and was created in 2005.
* The Ayrton Senna complex is the most visited tourist attraction in Boa Vista. It consists of Ayrton Senna, Velia Coutinho (Alimentation Square and a show place), Praça das Águas (a square where there is a water show), Millennium Portal (it was created to commemorate the 21st century), and Praça das Artes (the newest and the largest plazas in the complex).

==Culture==
===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===
Festa Junina was introduced to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John&#x27;s day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in European countries), on 24 June, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. The festivities traditionally begin after 12 June, on the eve of St Anthony&#x27;s day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter&#x27;s day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural celebration, today, in Brazil, it is now largely a city festival.

===The Civic Center===

The Civic Center, built in the form of an opened fan, starts from the banks of the Rio Branco. This design was created by the engineer Darci Aleixo Deregusson during Ene Garcez&#x27;s government, the first of its kind in Roraima.

From the Civic Center runs a system of 16 avenues, with inspiration drawn from Paris, France, Belo Horizonte, and Goiânia, Brazil. In this square are the head offices of the Executive, Judicial and Legislative branches of the state government. Other buildings of significance are the Palace of Culture, the Amazônia Bank, the Ministry of Education, and a cathedral.

The civic center also has a monument to miners.

==Demography==

Initially, indigenous people were the only inhabitants of Boa Vista. Boa Vista had the highest growth rate of any Brazilian capital in the 1970s, at 3% per year. Immigrants were attracted to this city due to employment opportunities generated by public service jobs for Brazilians. General commercial opportunities attract immigrants from neighboring countries.
In 1950 Boa Vista had about 5,200 inhabitants. This number grew 47-fold in only 56 years to approximately 250,000 inhabitants.

According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Boa Vista had more than 375,000 inhabitants in 2018. The city grew more than 10% in just one year due mainly to Venezuelan immigration.

Ethnic groups found in Boa Vista include: Amerindians, Portuguese, Africans, Germans, Venezuelans, Guyanese and Lebanese.

==Sports==
There are several professional football clubs in Boa Vista:
*Atlético Roraima Clube
*Baré Esporte Clube
*Grêmio Atlético Sampaio (GAS)
*São Raimundo Esporte Clube
*River Esporte Clube
*Atlético Rio Negro Clube
*Náutico Futebol Clube

The city&#x27;s most important stadium is Estádio Flamarion Vasconcelos, better known as &quot;Canarinho&quot;, located in the neighborhood of the same name, Canarinho. The stadium, which located in the southern part of Boa Vista, has a maximum capacity of 10,000 people.

Also located in Boa Vista is the Estádio Raimundo Ribeiro de Souza, better known as the &quot;Ribeirão&quot;, which is located in a suburb of the city.

==Geography==
The city is situated on the western bank of the Branco River, and it lies 220 km from Brazil&#x27;s border with Venezuela. It is the only Brazilian state capital located entirely north of the equator.
===Climate===
Boa Vista experiences a tropical savanna climate (Koppen &quot;Aw&quot;), with a hot, humid wet season and a very warm dry season. Being the only major Brazilian city north of the equator, the wettest and driest months in Boa Vista are the reverse of the rest of the Amazonian region of Brazil, with a hot, humid, rainy period from April to November and a very warm, dry period from December to March. Temperature fluctuations are relatively small throughout the year. When considering the 4 seasons(spring, summer, fall, winter), summer (June to August) is the rainiest and coldest season, while fall (September to November) is the hottest season.

The Maracá Ecological Station was established by presidential decree on 2 June 1981. The station consists of the island of Maracá between the Santa Rosa and Maracá branches of the Uraricoera River in the municipality of Boa Vista, and has an area of .
The strictly protected area was established with the purpose of preserving a representative sample of the Amazon ecosystem.

== Transport ==
===International Airport===
Boa Vista is served by Boa Vista-Atlas Brasil Cantanhede International Airport with direct flights to Brasília, Georgetown (Guyana), and Manaus. Boa Vista International Airport was opened on February 19, 1973, and underwent major remodelings in 1998 and 2009. The passenger terminal, runway and apron were all enlarged, and a separate taxiway was built.

Boa Vista Air Force Base - ALA7, one of the most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Boa Vista.

===Highways===

The federal government has started a project to link Boa Vista by road to Manaus and then by extension to the major centers of Brazil, by asphalting the BR-174 and building several bridges in the Amazon forest, allowing a direct road link to Manaus and then on over the BR-319 to the central regions of Brazil.

<doc id="693797" wikidata="Q850569" url="?curid=693797" title="Equity swap">
<text>An equity swap is a financial derivative contract (a swap) where a set of future cash flows are agreed to be exchanged between two counterparties at set dates in the future. The two cash flows are usually referred to as &quot;legs&quot; of the swap; one of these &quot;legs&quot; is usually pegged to a floating rate such as LIBOR. This leg is also commonly referred to as the &quot;floating leg&quot;. The other leg of the swap is based on the performance of either a share of stock or a stock market index. This leg is commonly referred to as the &quot;equity leg&quot;. Most equity swaps involve a floating leg vs. an equity leg, although some exist with two equity legs.

An equity swap involves a notional principal, a specified duration and predetermined payment intervals. 

Equity swaps are typically traded by delta one trading desks.

==Applications==
Typically equity swaps are entered into in order to avoid transaction costs (including Tax), to avoid locally based dividend taxes, limitations on leverage (notably the US margin regime) or to get around rules governing the particular type of investment that an institution can hold.

Equity swaps also provide the following benefits over plain vanilla equity investing:

* An investor in a physical holding of shares loses possession on the shares once he sells his position. However, using an equity swap the investor can pass on the negative returns on equity position without losing the possession of the shares and hence voting rights.
:For example, let&#x27;s say A holds 100 shares of a Petroleum Company. As the price of crude falls the investor believes the stock would start giving him negative returns in the short run. However, his holding gives him a strategic voting right in the board which he does not want to lose. Hence, he enters into an equity swap deal wherein he agrees to pay Party B the return on his shares against LIBOR+25 on a notional amt. If A is proven right, he will get money from B on account of the negative return on the stock as well as LIBOR+25 on the notional. Hence, he mitigates the negative returns on the stock without losing on voting rights.

* It allows an investor to receive the return on a security which is listed in such a market where he cannot invest due to legal issues.
:For example, let&#x27;s say A wants to invest in company X listed in Country C. However, A is not allowed to invest in Country C due to capital control regulations. He can however, enter into a contract with B, who is a resident of C, and ask him to buy the shares of company X and provide him with the return on share X and he agrees to pay him a fixed / floating rate of return.

Equity swaps, if effectively used, can make investment barriers vanish and help an investor create leverage similar to those seen in derivative products. However a clearing house is needed to settle the contract in a neutral location to offset counterparty risk.

Investment banks that offer this product usually take a riskless position by hedging the client&#x27;s position with the underlying asset. For example, the client may trade a swap – say Vodafone. The bank credits the client with 1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45. The bank pays the return on this investment to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own trading book (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against realised profit or loss on its own investment in the underlying asset. The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself). It may also use the hedge position stock (1,000 Vodafone in this example) as part of a funding transaction such as stock lending, repo or as collateral for a loan.

==Examples==
Parties may agree to make periodic payments or a single payment at the maturity of the swap (&quot;bullet&quot; swap).

Take a simple index swap where Party A swaps £5,000,000 at LIBOR + 0.03% (also called LIBOR + 3 basis points) against £5,000,000 (FTSE to the £5,000,000 notional).

In this case Party A will pay (to Party B) a floating interest rate (LIBOR +0.03%) on the £5,000,000 notional and would receive from Party B any percentage increase in the FTSE equity index applied to the £5,000,000 notional.

In this example, assuming a LIBOR rate of 5.97% p.a. and a swap tenor of precisely 180 days, the floating leg payer/equity receiver (Party A) would owe (5.97%+0.03%)*£5,000,000*180/360 = £150,000 to the equity payer/floating leg receiver (Party B).

At the same date (after 180 days) if the FTSE had appreciated by 10% from its level at trade commencement, Party B would owe 10%*£5,000,000 = £500,000 to Party A.
If, on the other hand, the FTSE at the six-month mark had fallen by 10% from its level at trade commencement, Party A would owe an additional 10%*£5,000,000 = £500,000 to Party B, since the flow is negative.

For mitigating credit exposure, the trade can be reset, or &quot;marked-to-market&quot; during its life. In that case, appreciation or depreciation since the last reset is paid and the notional is increased by any payment to the floating leg payer (pricing rate receiver) or decreased by any payment from the floating leg payer (pricing rate receiver).

Equity swaps have many applications. For example, a portfolio manager with XYZ Fund can swap the fund&#x27;s returns for the returns of the S&amp;P 500 (capital gains, dividends and income distributions). They most often occur when a manager of a fixed income portfolio wants the portfolio to have exposure to the equity markets either as a hedge or a position. The portfolio manager would enter into a swap in which he would receive the return of the S&amp;P 500 and pay the counterparty a fixed rate generated from his portfolio. The payment the manager receives will be equal to the amount he is receiving in fixed-income payments, so the manager&#x27;s net exposure is solely to the S&amp;P 500 (and risk that the counterparty defaults). These types of swaps are usually inexpensive and require little in terms of administration.

<doc id="693809" wikidata="Q842880" url="?curid=693809" title="Chop Suey!">
<text>&quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is a song by the American heavy metal band System of a Down. It was released on August 13, 2001, as the first single from their second album, &quot;Toxicity&quot; (2001). The single earned the band its first Grammy nomination in 2002 for Best Metal Performance at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is often considered the band&#x27;s signature song, and its music video has reached one billion views on YouTube.

==Overview==
In an interview, System of a Down&#x27;s guitarist, Daron Malakian, explained, &quot;The song is about how we are regarded differently depending on how we pass. Everyone deserves to die. Like, if I were now to die from drug abuse, they might say I deserved it because I abused dangerous drugs. Hence the line, &#x27;I cry when angels deserve to die.&#x27;&quot; The lyrics for the midsection (&quot;Father into your hands I commend my spirit&quot; ...) were randomly picked out by the singer, Serj Tankian, from the producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s book collection after Tankian was struggling for ideas. Although it was not revealed what book the lines were taken from, they are quoted from the sayings of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:46 and Mark 15:34).

==Song title==
The song was originally titled either &quot;Suicide&quot; (according to the bassist, Shavo Odadjian) or &quot;Self-Righteous Suicide&quot; (according to Rubin), but the name was changed in response to real or anticipated pushback from Columbia Records. According to Odadjian, the song title is a wordplay: &quot;Suey&quot; is &quot;suicide&quot;, &quot;chopped&quot; in half. Most pressings of the album include an intro to the track where the singer, Serj Tankian, can faintly be heard saying &quot;we&#x27;re rolling &#x27;Suicide while the drummer, John Dolmayan, is counting the band in.

==Music video==
The music video was the band&#x27;s first collaboration with the director Marcos Siega, and is set in the parking lot of the Oak Tree Inn Motel, 5265 W Sunset Blvd, in Los Angeles, hometown of the band. The members are performing the song on stage, surrounded by approximately 1,500 fans. Editing devices are used to create the effect of the band members &quot;walking through&quot; one another and teleporting on and off the stage. One scene briefly shows Tankian eating chop suey with some fans, the only reference to the title dish in either the song or the video. The video makes use of the SnorriCam technique, in which an actor will have a camera attached to them with a harness, making it appear as though the background is moving and the actor is stationary. In the middle of the video, the Armenian Flag can be seen. The video reached one billion views on YouTube in November 2020.

==Reception==
&quot;Loudwire&quot; included the song in its list of &quot;The Best Hard Rock Songs of the 21st Century&quot;, where it was ranked at number one. &quot;Loudwire&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; both named it as System of a Down&#x27;s best song. In March 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; at number 37 on their &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot; list. As of March 2024, “Chop Suey!” has 1.2B streams on Spotify, making it System of a Down’s most-streamed song.

==Controversy==
&quot;Chop Suey!&quot; was the first single off of &quot;Toxicity&quot;, an album that was at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart during the week of the September 11 attacks. A controversy surrounding the popular single, especially the line &#x27;&quot;I don&#x27;t think you trust in my self-righteous suicide&quot;&#x27;, at the time led to Clear Channel Radio placing the song on a list of post-9/11 inappropriate titles. Although it was never actually banned completely from the air, radio stations were advised against playing any of the songs on the list.

==Track listing==


==Commercial performance==
&quot;Chop Suey!&quot; was a moderate success on the charts around the world. In Australia, after hitting No. 3 on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2001, with virtually no airplay on commercial radio, it debuted and peaked at No. 14 in February 2002. It is System of a Down&#x27;s highest-charting single in Australia. In the United States, the song peaked at No. 76, making it the band&#x27;s lowest peaking song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 due to the fact it was taken off the radio for its political lyrics. On the Modern Rock Tracks chart, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; peaked at No. 7, becoming the band&#x27;s first top ten single. On the UK Singles Chart, it debuted and peaked at No. 17.

==Lil Uzi Vert version==
On June 30, 2023, American rapper and singer Lil Uzi Vert released a cover of &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, titled &quot;CS&quot;, as a part of their third studio album, &quot;Pink Tape&quot;. 

System of a Down singer, Serj Tankian, posted on Facebook: &quot;Covers are always the biggest compliment to artists and songwriters.&quot; The bassist, Shavo Odadjian, also reacted positively to the cover on Instagram.

<doc id="693810" wikidata="Q778382" url="?curid=693810" title="Expressionist dance">
<text>Expressive dance from German Ausdruckstanz, is a form of artistic dance in which the individual and artistic presentation (and sometimes also processing) of feelings is an essential part. It emerged as a counter-movement to classical ballet at the beginning of the 20th century in Europe. Traditional ballet was perceived as austere, mechanical and tightly held in fixed and conventional forms. Other designations are &quot;modern dance&quot; and (especially in the historical context) &quot;free dance&quot;, &quot;expressionist dance&quot; or &quot;new artistic dance&quot;, in Anglo-American countries &quot;German dance&quot;. In 2014, modern dance with the stylistic forms and mediation forms of rhythmic and expressive dance movements was included in the as defined by the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. German Expressionist dance is related to &quot;Tanztheater&quot;.

== History ==
Expressionist dance was marked by the passage of modernism, vitalism, expressionism, avant-garde and a general protest against artistic stagnation and the old society.
Ballet was perceived to have been superficial entertainment. The new dance would be art, both individual and artistic creation. The dance was described as the art of movement.

It was a revolution. It would be more expressive, and show more spirit and emotion and less virtuosity. The dance would be improvisational, uninhibited and provocative. Future spiritual and bodily reform movements expressed themselves in a new &quot;natural&quot; naked dance. The women took centre stage. A key protagonist was Isadora Duncan, who around 1900 had taken from classical dance technique and costume. She had even taken off dancing shoes – &quot;you do not play the piano with gloves on&quot;. She wanted to unite the body, mind and spirit in her art, and searched with Olga Desmond for inspiration in ancient Greek and Egyptian art, during the time of Orientalism.

The revolutionary movements in Germany and the USA were most obvious, two countries that had no older rooted ballet tradition. The forerunners in Europe included Clotilde von Derp, Hertha Feist, Hilde Holger, Loie Fuller, Jo Mihaly and especially Mary Wigman.

Schools for expressionist dance had special philosophies and emphases for dance, such as naturalness, breathing, tension / relaxation etc. It was often associated with floor contact, &quot;weight&quot; of dance movements, and experiments with music. Body and physicality were strongly emphasized. Rudolf von Laban was a theoretical prominent figure who was based on metaphysical ideas and one of the pioneers of &quot;Ausdruckstanz&quot; in Germany. From 1913-1918, Laban operated a school for art on the colony Monte Verità in Ascona, Switzerland, which became a teaching centre for the new dance. Among his students were Kurt Jooss and Mary Wigman.

Mary Wigman was an important trendsetter as a dancer, choreographer and teacher. In her school in Dresden (opened in 1920) she taught Europe&#x27;s premier aspiring dancers Gret Palucca, Harald Kreutzberg, Jeanna Falk, Dore Hoyer and Yvonne Georgi. Hanya Holm brought her theories to the United States, while Birgit Åkesson went her own way with her dance research.

The &quot;Denishawn School&quot; in the United States was founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, with such students as Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey. Its independent and pioneering dance came to form the backbone of modern dance, whose many branches stretched forth up until today.

Butoh is inspired by the German expressionist dance of the 1950s.

The British choreographer and live performer Liz Aggiss, who trained with Hanya Holm and Hilde Holger, has been making expressionist dance works since 1986. Her first solo show, &quot;Grotesque Dancer&quot;, was inspired by Valeska Gert. In 1992, Holger revived four dances for Aggiss from her repertoire: &quot;Die Forelle (The Trout)&quot; (1923), &quot;Le Martyre de San Sebastien&quot; (1923), &quot;Mechaniches Ballett&quot; (1926) and &quot;Golem&quot; (1937). These were first performed with Billy Cowie, as Vier Tanze, at the Manchester Festival of Expressionism in 1992. Sophie Constanti wrote that &#x27;Together all four pieces danced with great sensitivity and aplomb by Aggiss...provided a fascinating insight into the lost Ausdruckstanz of central Europe.&#x27;

Indian dancer Patruni Sastry has been working on choreographic style &quot;Indian expressionism&quot; where the major work is focused on queer rights and other social elements

<text>Wendy Joan Matthews (born 13 January 1960) is a Canadian-born Australian singer-songwriter who has been a member of Models and Absent Friends and is a solo artist. She released Top 20 hit singles in the 1990s including &quot;Token Angels&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss (Like Angels Do)&quot;, &quot;The Day You Went Away&quot; and &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; with Top 20 albums, &quot;You&#x27;ve Always Got The Blues&quot; (duet album with Kate Ceberano), &quot;Émigré&quot;, &quot;Lily&quot;, &quot;The Witness Tree&quot; and her compilation, &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;. She has won six Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane she provides &quot;extraordinary, crystal-clear vocals [...] a soulfulness that was the mark of a truly gifted singer&quot;.

Matthews appeared on three series of &quot;It Takes Two&quot;—an Australian TV celebrity singing competition—partnered with Richard Champion (2006), Russell Gilbert (2007) and John Mangos (2008). On 27 October 2010, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews.

==Biography==
===1960–1981: early years===
Wendy Joan Matthews was born in 1960 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with Abenaki (First Nations tribe), Spanish and Scottish ancestry. Peter and Joan Matthews already had a son, Gary born a year earlier and another son, Glenn followed a year after Matthews. She listened and sang along to Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt and Barbra Streisand records. Her parents separated when she was 14, Peter became a Vancouver advertising executive and Joan took up yoga instructing near Quebec. At the age of 15 Matthews joined friends in the Little Benny Blues Band (named after Little Benny Park where they hung out). She left school at 16 and went busking across North America including south to Mexico with friends. By 1978, she was in Los Angeles where she busked, made jewellery and worked as a session singer. In February 1981, Matthews sang lead vocal for &quot;Willow Pattern&quot; on Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s album &quot;Dragon King&quot; (1982). She met Japanese musician, Hiroshi Sato, and travelled to Japan to record lead vocals for his fourth album, &quot;Awakening&quot;, which was released in June on Alfa Records.

===1982–1990: soundtracks, Rockmelons and Absent Friends===

Back in Los Angeles, Australian singer Glenn Shorrock (ex-Little River Band) asked her to provide backing vocals on his solo album &quot;Villain of the Peace&quot; (1982) and to join him on his subsequent six-week tour of Australia in 1983. Matthews decided to stay in Sydney at the tour&#x27;s completion and found herself in demand as a session vocalist and singing jingles. She sang on albums by Jimmy Barnes, Richard Clapton, Tim Finn and Icehouse. After singing backing vocals on Models&#x27; 1985 album &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot;, she became a regular vocalist for the band. Matthews and Models&#x27; guitarist and vocalist, Sean Kelly, had an 11-year personal relationship. Other backing singers for Models included Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne, both members of I&#x27;m Talking – the two bands often toured together. In 1986, Matthews joined Peter Blakeley and The Resurrection, with Blakeley (ex-Rockmelons) on lead vocals, Chris Abrahams on bass guitar and piano (ex-The Benders), Jim Benjamin on drums and Mark Punch on guitar (Renée Geyer Band). Her second album with Models, &quot;Models&#x27; Media&quot; appeared in December which reached the top 30.

In 1985, Matthews recorded vocals for the soundtrack of Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV series &quot;Dancing Daze&quot; (1986) with musical production by Martin Armiger. Her tracks were, &quot;Dancing Daze&quot; (duet with Jenny Morris), &quot;Dare to Be Bold&quot;, &quot;Might Have Been&quot; (trio with Morris and Mark Williams) and &quot;Lost in a Dancing Daze&quot;. First three of her tracks were released as singles but neither they nor the related album, &quot;Dancing Daze – Rock&quot; reached the top 50. ABC-TV and Armiger asked Matthews to sing with Ceberano on the soundtrack to the series &quot;Stringer&quot; in 1987. The soundtrack &quot;You&#x27;ve Always Got The Blues&quot; was released as a duet album by Ceberano and Matthews in April 1988 and reached No. 4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart.

Matthews was a member of Noel&#x27;s Cowards, a short term project, including ex-Split Enz members Noel Crombie on drums, Nigel Griggs on bass guitar and Phil Judd on guitar. Noel&#x27;s Cowards, with Matthews on lead vocals, provided six tracks for the Australian movie &quot;Rikky and Pete&quot; (1988). She was featured vocalist on the single &quot;Jump&quot; released in October from Rockmelons&#x27; debut album &quot;Tales of the City&quot;. &quot;Tales of the City&quot; peaked at No. 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989, Rockmelons won &#x27;Breakthrough Artist – Album&#x27; and &quot;Stringer&quot; won &#x27;Best Original Soundtrack / Cast / Show Recording&#x27;.

Matthews joined the Australian supergroup, Absent Friends, in 1989 with Kelly and James Valentine of Models, Garry Gary Beers of INXS, Roger Mason and Mick King. She sang lead vocals on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be with Nobody but You&quot; which reached No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart; the related album, &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking Up Your Address&quot; peaked at No.7. The band toured Australia and then supported INXS on a European tour. During this period, Matthews continued her session work, singing on the Cher album &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; in 1989 and on Blakeley&#x27;s solo album &quot;Harry&#x27;s Café De Wheels&quot; in 1990. Absent Friends disbanded and Matthews pursued her solo career.

===1990–1999: solo success===

In 1990, Matthews recorded her debut solo album &quot;Émigré&quot; with the assistance of Absent Friends members, Beers, Kelly, King, Mason, Valentine, Francois and Andrew Duffield as well as Tim Finn and Blakeley. It was produced by Ricky Fataar and released on the rooArt label owned by INXS manager, Chris Murphy; &quot;Émigré&quot; became a hit, being certified platinum. She won the Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine award for best female vocalist in 1990 for her debut album and her work with Absent Friends.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be with Nobody but You&quot; won the ARIA Award for Single of the Year for Absent Friends; while Matthews won two ARIA Awards, ARIA Award for Best Female Artist and ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist – Single for &quot;Token Angels&quot;, which hit No. 18. Subsequent hits from the album were &quot;Woman&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; (No. 34) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Kiss (Like Angels Do)&quot; (No. 14). Her touring band included Ron François on bass guitar (ex-Teardrop Explodes), Amanda Brown on oboe and violin (ex-The Go-Betweens), Robbie James on guitar (Ganggajang), King on guitar (Absent Friends), Lisa Maxwell on backing vocals, Mark Meyer on drums (Moving Pictures), Mark O&#x27;Connor on keyboards and Valentine on saxophone. On 31 May, she performed at Dallas Brooks Hall, Melbourne which was released as the live album &quot;The Way It Has to Be&quot; in October. She also supported the Neville Brothers on their Australian tour.

In February–March 1992 Matthews recorded her second solo studio album &quot;Lily&quot; in Los Angeles with T-Bone Burnett producing, it was released on 28 September while she was on tour supporting Simply Red. Her album peaked at No. 2 and achieved double-platinum in Australia selling over 140,000 copies. The lead single &quot;The Day You Went Away&quot; hit No. 2 while the album spawned two further hits in &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; (No. 15) and &quot;If Only I Could&quot; (No. 41). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992, Matthews was nominated for Best Female Artist. The Canadian CD release of &quot;Lily&quot; included a French-language version of &quot;The Day You Went Away&quot;. Matthews toured internationally in 1993 including gigs in London, Montreal and New York. She won &#x27;Best Female Artist&#x27; for &quot;Lily&quot; and both &#x27;Best Single&#x27; and ARIA Award for Highest Selling Single for &quot;The Day You Went Away&quot; at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993. Matthews had a film role as a nightclub singer in &quot;Flynn&quot; (1993) which starred Guy Pearce as Australian-born actor Errol Flynn.

Matthews released her next album &quot;The Witness Tree&quot; on 14 November 1994, featuring the Top 40 hit &quot;Standing Strong&quot;. The album went platinum selling 100,000 copies and she won her third ARIA award for Best Female Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 for &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;. In 1995, Matthews became an Australian citizen. Her single &quot;Standing Strong&quot; won &#x27;Most Performed Australian Work&#x27; at the APRA Awards of 1995. She returned to Canada for a visit before the release of her next album &quot;Ghosts&quot; in 1997. The single &quot;Beloved&quot; from the album peaked at No. 49 on the Australian charts. In 1999, Matthews released &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, a greatest hits package which hit No. 4, earning her another platinum certification. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop&quot;, Matthews provides &quot;extraordinary, crystal-clear vocals [...] a soulfulness that was the mark of a truly gifted singer&quot;.

===2000–present: music, TV and other activities===

In 2000, Matthews joined the cast of a new Australian musical theatre production of &quot;Godspell&quot; alongside Angry Anderson, Jimmy Barnes, Debra Byrne, Marie Wilson, Fiona Horne, Belinda Emmett, Paul Mercurio and Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby. In February, with rehearsals commencing, Matthews released her cover of &quot;Day by Day&quot; but financial difficulties prevented the musical from being staged. She contributed &quot;Pure Inspiration&quot; to &quot;Olympic Record&quot; – an album for the Sydney Olympics by various Australian artists.

In 2001, Matthews relocated from Sydney to a property near Coffs Harbour on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales. Her solo album, &quot;Beautiful View&quot;, was released on 17 July and made the Top 40. Produced by Michael Szumowski, it was her first with BMG records, and included three singles, &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Beautiful View&quot; and &quot;Like the Sun&quot; which did not reach the top 50. A limited edition of &quot;Beautiful View&quot; included a bonus six-track disc.

In 2003, Matthews sang a duet with Rod Stewart on the track &quot;My Heart Stood Still&quot; on the Australian release of his album &quot;As Time Goes By: The Great American Songbook, Volume II&quot;. She released her own covers album, &quot;Café Naturale&quot; in May 2004. Matthews explained why she recorded it acoustically, &quot;To keep creative you have to break down your own personal barriers. With this record that meant moving away from pop and crafting something instrument-driven, something that feels like me playing live&quot;. The album includes acoustic versions of U2&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; from the &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Protection&quot; from the album of the same name. The first single &quot;All I Need&quot; is a version of the Air song from the &quot;Moon Safari&quot; album. Matthews&#x27; album debuted in the top 50 of the ARIA charts.

Matthews embarked on the national Fallen Angels Tour during May–June 2008 and then co-headlined with Ian Moss in October–November. On 8 November, Matthews released the album &quot;She&quot; on her own independent record label, Barking Bear. The album is a personal collection of favourite songs by women who have inspired her, Bonnie Raitt, Aretha Franklin, Emmylou Harris, Chrissie Hynde, Joni Mitchell, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Lucinda Williams and Jane Siberry. In June 2010, she combined with country musician, Adam Harvey for the Both Sides Tour. In October 2010, Matthews performed at the Opening Ceremony of the Alice Springs Masters Games. On 27 October, her former band, Models were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame by Matthews. The line-up of Duffield, Ferrie, Kelly, Mason, Price and Valentine performed &quot;I Hear Motion&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot;. Matthews recalled meeting the group for the first time at a recording session – she was due to provide backing vocals but they were busy playing indoor cricket in the studio.

Matthews independently released &quot;Billie and Me: The White Room Sessions&quot; on 27 July 2015. The live album, available through her official website only, was recorded in the winter of 2012 with Brendan St Ledger on piano and Greg Royal on standup bass. The album celebrates the centenary year birth of Billie Holiday, who Matthews describes Holiday as an &quot;iconic woman whose soul and music has been long admired.&quot;

In November 2016, Matthews featured on the Catherine Britt single, &quot;F U Cancer&quot; alongside Kasey Chambers, Beccy Cole, Lyn Bowtell, Josh Pyke and Wes Carr.

<doc id="693816" wikidata="Q1402176" url="?curid=693816" title="Fejér kernel">
<text>In mathematics, the Fejér kernel is a summability kernel used to express the effect of Cesàro summation on Fourier series. It is a non-negative kernel, giving rise to an approximate identity. It is named after the Hungarian mathematician Lipót Fejér (1880–1959).
==Definition==
The Fejér kernel has many equivalent definitions. We outline three such definitions below: 

1) The traditional definition expresses the Fejér kernel formula_1 in terms of the Dirichlet kernel: formula_2

where 
:formula_3 
is the &quot;k&quot;th order Dirichlet kernel.

2) The Fejér kernel formula_1 may also be written in a closed form expression as follows

formula_5

This closed form expression may be derived from the definitions used above. The proof of this result goes as follows.

First, we use the fact that the Dirichlet kernel may be written as:
:formula_6 
Hence, using the definition of the Fejér kernel above we get:
:formula_7

Using the trigonometric identity: formula_8
:formula_9
Hence it follows that:
:formula_10
3) The Fejér kernel can also be expressed as:

formula_11

==Properties==
The Fejér kernel is a positive summability kernel. An important property of the Fejér kernel is formula_12 with average value of formula_13. 

===Convolution===
The convolution &quot;Fn&quot; is positive: for formula_14 of period formula_15 it satisfies 

:formula_16

Since formula_17, which depends only on the Fourier coefficients.
* A second consequence is that if formula_18 exists a.e., then formula_19 a.e., since Cesàro means formula_20 converge to the original sequence limit if it exists.

===Applications===
The Fejér kernel is used in signal processing and Fourier analysis.

<doc id="693825" wikidata="Q1464942" url="?curid=693825" title="Frinton-on-Sea">
<text>Frinton-on-Sea is a seaside town and (as just Frinton) a former civil parish, now in the parish of Frinton and Walton, in the Tendring district of Essex, England. In 2018 it had an estimated population of 4,837.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Frinton&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Frientuna&quot;. The name may mean &#x27;fenced-in or enclosed town or settlement&#x27;.

Until late Victorian times, Frinton-on-Sea was a church, several farms and a handful of cottages. In the 1890s, the original developer of the town, Peter Bruff, was bought out by the industrialist Richard Powell Cooper, who had already laid out the golf course. Powell Cooper rejected Bruff&#x27;s plans for a pier, stipulated the quality of housing to be built and prohibited boarding houses and pubs. The Sea Defence Act 1903 established a project to stabilise the cliffs, with the Greensward, which separates the Esplanade from the sea, put in place to stabilise the land further.

In the first half of the 20th century the town attracted visitors from high society. Connaught Avenue, named after the Duke of Connaught and opened by his wife, was nicknamed &quot;East Anglia&#x27;s Bond Street&quot;. Other attractions included a lido, complete with palm trees, hotels along the Esplanade, and an amateur tennis tournament. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) frequented the golf club and Winston Churchill rented a house. Frinton was the last target in England attacked by the Luftwaffe, in 1944.

The town has a reputation for a conservative nature (although it was in a Labour constituency from 1997 to 2005). Until recently, there were no pubs, although there have long been bars in seafront hotels and at the golf and War Memorial clubs. The first pub, the Lock and Barrel, opened in 2000.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the name of Frinton exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,002. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Frinton and Walton&quot;. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2196.

==Geography==
Frinton has three points of entry by road: an unadopted road from Walton-on-the-Naze in the north, a residential road, and a CCTV monitored level crossing adjacent to the railway station which replaced the older gated crossing in 2009. Frinton was once geographically distinct, but housing estates now line the roads between Frinton and Walton-on-the-Naze, Kirby Cross and Kirby-Le-Soken.

The town has sandy and stone beach washed daily, more than a mile (1,600 m) long, with wardens in season, and an area of sea zoned for swimming, sailing and windsurfing. The shore is lined by a promenade with several hundred beach huts. Landward from the promenade is a long greensward, popular with young and old alike, stretching from the boundary with Walton-on-Naze to the golf club in the south.

Six miles offshore lies Gunfleet Lighthouse, constructed in 1850 but abandoned in 1921.

==Religion==
There are two Anglican parish churches: St Mary the Virgin is Norman in parts. The church of St Mary Magdalene was built in 1928 to accommodate worshippers from St Mary the Virgin. Across the road from St Mary Magadalene is the Evangelical Gospel Chapel. Frinton&#x27;s Catholic church, the Church of the Sacred Heart and St Francis, was built in 1904, as a public hall known as Queen&#x27;s Hall; the architect was William Hayne. It was acquired as a church in the 1920s. There is also a Methodist church, and a Free church.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sudbury TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Essex on 103.5 FM, Heart East on 96.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly Dream 100 FM) on 100.2 FM and Actual Radio an DAB station. The town is served by the local newspaper, Clacton and Frinton Gazette which publishes on Thursdays. 

==Frinton in popular culture==
Frinton is home to the Frinton Summer Theatre Season at the McGrigor Hall every summer. Started in 1937, by the Cambridge Academic T. P. Hoar as an amusement whilst he studied corrosion, it quickly developed a life of its own, employing many later famous actors at the start of their career. Michael Denison, Vanessa Redgrave, Timothy West, Jane Asher, David Suchet, Gary Oldman, Owen Teale, Lynda Bellingham, Jack Klaff, Antony Sher and Neil Dudgeon all started their careers at Frinton. For many years it was run by the British actor Jack Watling, and his son Giles and son-in-law Seymour Matthews. His daughters Debbie and Dilys often appeared on stage, as did &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo! cast member John D. Collins. It is now run by Clive Brill.

Frinton&#x27;s population of retirees makes it the butt of jokes, with the LNER advertising slogan &quot;Harwich for the Continent&quot; being appended &quot;Frinton for the incontinent&quot;. However, its genteel nature has ensured that property &#x27;within the gates&#x27; is well sought after.

Frinton was used in a recent Subway Sandwiches commercial for the UK, although the advert was not actually filmed in Frinton.

In Season 1 Episode 2 of the television series &quot;Minder&quot; Terry says in response to Arthur swearing on his mother&#x27;s grave that he knows for a fact his mother is alive and well and living in Frinton.

==Notable residents==
The actor Ross Davidson was living in Frinton-on-Sea at the time of his death in October 2006.

T.E.B. Clarke, novelist and writer of several Ealing comedies, including &quot;Passport To Pimlico&quot; and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot;, lived there as a child.

Disc jockeys Mike Read, Adrian John and David Hamilton lived in the town whilst broadcasting on Big L.

Richard Cobb (1917 - 1996), Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford, was born in the town.

In the 1920s and 1930s &quot;Turret Lodge&quot; on the Esplanade was owned by Fritz Dupre, the &quot;manganese ore king&quot;, for use as his family&#x27;s holiday home.

The late Group Captain Alfred &#x27;Ken&#x27; Gatward, who flew a mission to occupied Paris during the Second World War to drop a French Tricolour on the Arc de Triomphe, lived in the town.

Actress Deborah Watling, best known for her role in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a companion to the second Doctor, lived in the town until her death in 2017.

<text>Pocket Viewer (Casio PV) was a model range of personal digital assistants (PDAs) developed by Casio around the turn of the 21st century.

==Description==
Pocket Viewer was a model range of PDAs from Casio. Early models used Intel x86 based processors (manufactured by NEC). Later models used Hitachi processors from the SuperH family. Both models ran Casio&#x27;s proprietary OS &#x27;CASIO PVOS&#x27;. The functionality of the pocket viewers extended beyond the digital diary segment and targeted consumers who needed more compute power in their personal organizers. The pocket viewers competed directly with the then market leader in the segment the Palm-pilots. They were priced under $200 at first release.

The pocket viewers, weighing under 5 ounces, were light and portable. The face of the device was almost entirely covered by a monochrome liquid crystal display. Towards the bottom of the LCD there were a few navigation keys. The lower most part of the LCD had quick short cuts to the standard applications permanently indicated. The short-cuts include off, back-light, Scheduler, Contacts, Quick Memo, Sync Start, Escape, Menubar. The standard applications available on the pocket viewer include Expense, PVsheet, Quickmemo, Contacts, Scheduler, ToDo list, Reminder/Calendar and Alarm. The starting interface consisted of a scrollable two column list of icons. Clicking on the icon starts the application. Text was entered via an on-screen keyboard. The pocket viewer did not have in-built hand writing recognition support. A third party GPL addin PVMerlin may have attempted to provide hand writing recognition.

Pocket viewers used conventional 2 x AAA batteries and under normal use a completely charged battery lasted around 2 months. When not actively being used the pocket viewer switches off the display and goes into power saving mode. The specifications stated that it could function for 50 hours on alkaline batteries without use of back-light. Except for PV-S1600 which used Universal Serial Bus (USB) 1.0, all the other pocket viewers used a COM (RS-232) port to communication between a personal computer and the pocket viewer.

Casio made the pocket viewer SDK available. Using the SDK users could create their own applications called add-ins, which could be downloaded to the pocket viewer using the synchronization software. In time, a small user base who created and made their add-in applications available on-line for free or for profit emerged. User forums such as pocketviewer.de, pocketviewer.com, pocket-viewer.ru and pocketviewer webrings flourished in their time and have since closed. During 2005–2010, the second hand market was on the wane. OWBasic, a third party add-in, provided the easy to learn and use BASIC interpreted programming language on the hand-helds, expanding their functionality to also being programmable hand-held calculators/computers. The device had the computer power and functionality as the home computers of the 80s.

The pocket viewers ability to access the internet was limited. PC software could synchronize email with the device which was not convenient. The device had a specialized serial port, and could theoretically communicate with other devices using the Serial Line Internet Protocol and execute modem AT commands.

Casio also provided some additional applications. Enterprise Harmony, which enabled Outlook 2003 synchronization of Outlook contacts, calendar On windows. PVsheet, a spread sheet application, which could upload/download comma separated spread-sheets. Travel phrase guide, which could translate preset text between English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese.

The Casio pocket viewer series was sandwiched between digital diaries and the pocket PC series Casio Cassiopeia. Casio discontinued the pocket viewers as the pocket PCs became popular and their price came down.

==Technical details==
* The PV-100 did not have a back light. While the back light was available on PV-200 onwards, Casio by default did not allow the back-light to remain on more than 30 seconds. Casio did not recommend extending the duration of the back light citing damage and battery drain. as A third party application back light extender add in was required to keep the back light on beyond the default duration. The back-light was Casio&#x27;s trade marked EL-back-light, which is an electro-luminescent panel that causes the entire face to glow.
* The PV-S1600 did not use a NEC V30MZ processor, but used a Hitachi SH-3. The processor architectures are not compatible hence programs compiled for the earlier architectures do not work on the PV-S1600 without recompilation. OWBasic programs will work as they run in an interpreter.
* The NEC V30MZ was a 16 bit processor which used a segmented memory space. An indirect consequence is that those models can download a maximum of 16 addins
* The file system is divided into PVOS modes and sub modes. Each record is part of a file that is specified by mode and submode. Depending on the mode data sets are null-terminated in either binary or text format. Binary data sets are to 3 KB or 32 KB (records that are greater than 3 KB, can be loaded only into the far-segment, PV-S1600 has no restriction), text data sets to 2 KB (PV-S1600: limited 32 KB).
* The PV-750 has an IrDA port. Using IrDA, it is possible to send and receive email messages using a GSM-enabled mobile phone. SMS can also be sent on the PV-750Plus. The address book of the mobile phone can also be synchronized with that of PV. Casio&#x27;s operating system update for the PV-750 gives it the same functionality of the PV-750Plus.

==Notes==
* The HP 200LX a palm top computer, also used an 80186 chip
* The Casio ClassPad 300 is a maths orientated update of the pocket viewer.
* Casio did not provide any official linux support. Casio had contracted a 3rd party vendor for PC communication, and hence could not disclose any internal communication protocols. Apart from Casio PC sync and Enterprise Harmony, shareware Xlink/Win also provides communication with windows. An open-source GPL Linux application by the name PVlink is available with limited guarantees.
* Since Casio PVOS was a small proprietary OS, it did not benefit from mainstream platform support that Linux, or other proprietary OSes such as Pocket PC or Palm OS had.

<text>are the often non-standard kanji character readings (pronunciations) found almost exclusively in Japanese names.

In the Japanese language, many Japanese names are constructed from common characters with standard pronunciations. However, names may also contain rare characters which only occur as parts of names, or use non-standard readings of common characters. Often, the readings used are so esoteric that they cannot even be found in dictionaries. For example, the character , meaning &quot;hope&quot; or &quot;rare&quot;, has standard pronunciations , , and . However, as a female name, it can be pronounced Nozomi.

In compounds, &quot;nanori&quot; readings can be used in conjunction with other readings, such as in the name Iida (). Here, , a character meaning &#x27;meal&#x27;, is normally read as either or , but in the context of this name the special &quot;nanori&quot; reading is used instead. The second character is read using its standard &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; reading, . Often (as in the previous example), the &quot;nanori&quot; reading is related to the general meaning of the kanji, as it is frequently an old-fashioned way to read the character that has since fallen into disuse.
