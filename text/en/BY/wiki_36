<text>45 Commando Royal Marines (pronounced &quot;four-five commando&quot;) is a battalion sized unit of the British Royal Marines and subordinate unit within UK Commando Force, the principal Commando formation, under the Operational Command of the Fleet Commander.

Tasked as a Commando amphibious unit, 45 Cdo RM is capable of a wide range of operational tasks. Based at RM Condor, their barracks in Arbroath, personnel regularly deploy outside the United Kingdom on operations or training.

All personnel have completed the Commando course at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone in Devon, entitling them to wear the green beret, with attached personnel having completed the All Arms Commando Course.

==History==
===5th RM Battalion===
The 5th RM Battalion was originally raised for a brief period at the end of World War I (September 1918-February 1919), and was again raised on 2 April 1940 following mass mobilisation and the influx of &quot;hostilities only&quot; (HO) marines. The battalion was raised at Cowshot Camp in Brookwood (now part of the Pirbright Camp complex), being incorporated into 101 RM Bde, along with the 1st RM Battalion. Between August and October 1940 the battalion took part in operations in Dakar. On return until August 1943 the battalion conducted extensive training in Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Wight and Burley, where the battalion reformed as 45 RM Commando on 1 August 1943. It was commanded between March 1940 and February 1942 by Arnold Reading.

===45 RM Commando===
After reforming and retitling, the unit transitioned to the Commando role as a formed unit, by-passing the individual volunteer and selection process undertaken by Army Commando candidates. Personnel undertook, and completed, the Commando Basic Training Course at Achnacarry, Scotland. As part of the 1st Special Service Brigade, the Commando participated in Operation Overlord (the D-Day Normandy landings), before going on to move through Europe into Germany, including Brachterbeek on 23 January 1945. During the Ardennes Offensive, the retitled 1st Commando Brigade was given the task of holding a stretch of the River Meuse; it was during this period of operations that Lance Corporal H. Harden, a medical orderly of the RAMC attached to 45 (RM) Commando, won the Victoria Cross.

===Post-World War II reorganisation===
Following the Second World War both 1st Commando Brigade (Nos 3, 4 and 6 Army Commandos and 45 RM Commando) and 2nd Commando Brigade (Nos 2 and 9 Army Cdos and 40 and 43 RM Cdos) disbanded, leaving 3 Cdo Bde (then comprising 1 and 5 Army Cdos and 42 and 44 RM Cdos) in place in the Far East. 3 Cdo Bde reorganised, disbanding 1 and 5 Army Cdos, and took on 45 RM Cdo, which joined the Bde in Hong Kong, from the UK, in January 1946. In order to preserve the heritage of a 2 Cdo Bde unit, as well as that of 1 Cdo Bde (45 RM Cdo), 44 Commando was retitled 40 Commando (which had been disbanded in UK in October 1945) and took on 40 RM Cdo&#x27;s colours, battle honours and traditions, albeit with 44 RM Cdo&#x27;s manpower. The three remaining commandos were restyled 40, 42 and 45 Commandos RM in March 1946.

===1940s/1950s===

The Commando unit was based in Hong Kong between January 1946 and May 1947, conducting internal security duties, as part of 3 Cdo Bde RM. Between May 1947 and December 1948 the Commando moved to Malta, during which time it deployed to Libya, Palestine, Suez and Jordan. The Commando unit returned to Hong Kong in December 1948 and from there deployed to Malaya between 1950 and 1952 taking part in operations during the Emergency. Between 1952 and 1959 the Commando was once again based in Malta. In September 1955 45 Commando was deployed to Cyprus to undertake anti-terrorist operations against the EOKA guerrillas who were fighting against British control of the island. EOKA were a small, but powerful organisation of Greek Cypriots, who had great local support from the Greek community. The unit traveled to the Kyrenia mountain area of the island and in December 1955 launched Operation Foxhunter, a failed operation to destroy EOKA&#x27;s main base.

Then in 1956 the unit deployed to Egypt as part of the response to the Suez Crisis, conducting the first helicopter assault in history.

===1960s===
Between 1960 and 1967 the Commando was based in Aden, from where it conducted 10 operational tours in the Radfan during the Aden Emergency. The Commando unit also deployed briefly to Kuwait following an Iraqi threat to her Independence in 1961. In January 1964, part of then Tanganyika, later to become the Tanzanian Army mutinied. 45 Commando who were in Aden boarded HMS Centaur and sailed to East Africa and anchored off-shore from Dar es Salaam. The revolt was put down after 45 Commando landed by helicopter at Colito Barracks with other operations around the country over the coming days.
The last elements of the 45 Commando left Aden on 29 November 1967 to return to the UK for the first time since the end of World War II. They set up home in Stonehouse Barracks, Plymouth.

===1970s/1980s===
In 1970 the Commando began Arctic training for the first time, taking on the role of Britain&#x27;s mountain and Arctic warfare experts (joined later by the other Commandos). 45 Cdo RM deployed to Norway for the first of many winters in 1971, which coincided with a move of the unit from Stonehouse, Plymouth to the old Naval Air Station, RNAS Arbroath (now RM Condor) in Arbroath, Scotland, where the unit still remains. This period in the unit&#x27;s history is characterised by the alternation of Northern Ireland tours and winters in Norway, protecting NATO&#x27;s northern flank.

====Falklands War====

Following the Argentine invasion of 2 April 1982, 45 Cdo RM, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Andrew F. Whitehead RM, had their Easter leave cancelled and hastily deployed to the Falklands, travelling in a mix of Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) ships. Having made a tactical landing at Red Beach, Ajax Bay on 21 May 1982, the men of 45 Cdo RM yomped across East Falkland, via Port San Carlos, New House, Douglas Settlement, Teal Inlet and Mount Kent to take part in the Battle for Port Stanley. They conducted a night attack on the Two Sisters feature over the 11/12 June 1982, during which the Commando unit lost 8 men killed and 17 wounded. The Argentinians surrendered on 14 June 1982. Lt. Col Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).

===1990s===

The Commando unit deployed to Northern Iraq on Operation Haven at the end of the Gulf War, where it spent 2 months in the Zakho area, withdrawing at the end of June. In 1993 The Commando unit was deployed to Belize for the last operational jungle tour in that country. In a mirror image of its 1961 deployment to Kuwait, the Commando returned on Operation Driver in 1994, in support of Kuwait, following some threatening troop movements by the Iraqis on their side of the border. In 1998 the Commando unit was redirected from an exercise in Belize, to assist Nicaragua and Honduras following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.

===2000s===
At the turn of the Millennium, the Commando unit was deployed to Kosovo under KFOR as part of 3 Cdo Bde RM on Operation Agricola IV. From April 2002, the unit deployed to Afghanistan on Operation Jacana, and also took part in Operation Telic 1, the 2003 invasion of Iraq. X-Ray Company Group was attached to the Special Boat Service (SBS), Whisky Company Group attached to the Special Air Service (SAS).

In September 2003, 45 Commando was granted the Freedom of Angus in recognition of their service in Iraq and Afghanistan and contribution to the local economy of Arbroath, where they are based.

In January 2004 the unit deployed to Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) for 6 months in support of peacekeeping operations, returning home in June. On return, it became the Spearhead Lead Commando, a role assumed on a rotational basis. The Lead Commando is at a high level of readiness, able to deploy at short notice on operations worldwide.

In September 2004, whilst still Lead Commando unit, the Group deployed to the United States on Exercise BLACKHORSE. This was split into two phases, the first of which took place with the United States Marines Corps Ground-Air Combat Centre at 29 Palms, California. This 900 square miles of desert, allowed realistic live firing, involving artillery and air strikes. The second phase took place at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Centre, high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. An early snowfall meant the Commando was able to carry out cold weather warfare training, operating between 7000 and . 2006 saw the Unit deploy to Norway for further Arctic training which culminated with a NATO led exercise.

The focus switched to preparation for deploying to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 5 in late 2006. This deployment saw the Commando take on a number of different roles, the principal one being that of the Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT). The OMLT task was to work alongside the Afghan National Army and develop it into a self-sufficient organisation. The Unit returned from Afghanistan in April 2007.

October 2008 saw the Commando unit return to Afghanistan as Northern Battle Group in Helmand Province on Operation HERRICK 9. The operational area of responsibility was the Upper Sangin Valley which extended for 80Â km along the length of the Helmand River. The Battle Group was in excess of 1200 strong, half of whom came from 45 Commando.

April/May 2009 saw the return of the Commando to Arbroath in Scotland for reorganisation ahead of a winter deployment to Norway to practice cold weather and amphibious tactics.

===2010s===
45 Commando deployed to Afghanistan again, as part of 3 Commando Brigade, for 6 months in March 2011 on Operation Herrick 14. They returned home in October 2011.

45 Commando was the lead commando group for the UK until May 2013, able to deploy at short notice. In October 2013 Whisky Company from 45 Commando exercised in Ghana with US, Dutch and Spanish Marines.

45 Commando Royal Marines provided the guard of honour during the Beating Retreat Ceremony of the Royal Marines Band Service to celebrate the birthday of their Captain General Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at Horse Guards Parade in May 2016.

It became clear in 2018 that 45 Commando would, as would 40 Commando, form the infantry component of a Littoral Response Group, as part of restructuring in the Future Commando Force programme.

===2020s===
In 2022, 350 marines from 45 Commando supported diplomats from the British embassy in Ukraine, and a small number may have provided weapons and training to Ukrainian troops.

<text>Gabardine is a durable twill worsted wool. It is a tightly woven waterproof fabric and is used to make outerwear and various other garments, such as suits, overcoats, trousers, uniforms, and windbreakers. Thomas Burberry created the fabric in the late 1870s and patented it in 1888. The name gabardine comes from &quot;gaberdine&quot;, a type of long, cape-like dress worn during the Middle Ages.

Since its debut in the late 19th century, gabardine has taken on an important role in military, active, and outerwear due to its durable, breathable, waterproof, and lightweight nature. In particular, its widespread use by the British Armed Forces during World War I produced the garments now widely recognised as the trench coat.

== History ==

The word gaberdine or gabardine has been used to refer to a particular item of clothing, a sort of long cassock but often open at the front, since at least the 15th century. In the 16th century the term began to be used for outer garments of the poor, later narrowed to a rain cloak or protective smock-frock.

The modern use to describe a fabric rather than a garment dates to Thomas Burberry, founder of the Burberry fashion house in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England, who invented the fabric and revived the name gabardine in 1879. It was introduced by Burberry and patented in 1888. Prior to Burberry&#x27;s development of gabardine, rubberised cotton was the most common fabric used for waterproofing, and the material&#x27;s heaviness frequently made waterproof clothes uncomfortable. Gabardine, by contrast, was a lightweight, durable, breathable material. Its ability to shed water and break wind while preserving comfortable wearability helped revolutionise outerwear.

== Production ==
The original fabric was worsted wool, sometimes in combination with cotton, and was waterproofed using lanolin before weaving. Today the fibre may also be pure cotton, texturised polyester, viscose, or a blend. 

Gabardine is woven as a warp-faced steep or regular twill, with a prominent diagonal rib on the face and smooth surface on the back. Gabardine always has many more warp than weft yarns.

== Applications ==

Gabardine was quickly recognised for its military applications in the United Kingdom. In 1902, the British War Office commissioned Burberry to use the material in designing new coats for its soldiers that would better withstand demanding battlefield conditions. The original coat model produced by that commission was later updated, in 1914, in response to the harsh conditions of trench warfare during World War I. The suitability of gabardine to protecting soldiers from that environment resulted in the design&#x27;s widespread recognition as a trench coat, which continues to have influence in modern fashion. 

Burberry clothing of gabardine was also worn by many polar explorers. The fabric&#x27;s first arctic field test was performed by Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian scientist, explorer, diplomat, and eventual Nobel Peace Prize recipient who wore gabardine on his 1893 &quot;Fram&quot; expedition toward the North Pole. Subsequent polar explorers donned gabardine after Nansen&#x27;s expedition, including Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole, in 1911, and Ernest Shackleton, who used the material for clothing, tents, and even engine covers during a 1914 expedition to cross Antarctica. A jacket and plus-fours of this material were worn by George Mallory in his attempt on Mount Everest in 1924. In 2006 a replica of Malloryâs suit, recreated by using the fragments recovered from his body, was tested on Everest. The project showed that the clothing was effective at providing protection at high altitude.

In the 1950s, gabardine was used to produce colourful patterned casual jackets, trousers and suits. Companies like J. C. Penney, Sport Chief, Campus, Four Star, Curlee, Towncraft, and Oxford Clothes produced short-waisted gabardine jackets, sometimes reversible, commonly known as &quot;Ricky jackets&quot; or &quot;Gab jackets,&quot; along with the Hollywood leisure jackets that had been made since the 1930s. 

Cotton gabardine is often used by bespoke tailors to make pocket linings for suits, where the pockets&#x27; contents would quickly wear holes in flimsy pocket-lining material.

Clothing made from authentic wool gabardine generally requires dry cleaning.

<text>Paul Mattick Sr. (March 13, 1904 â February 7, 1981) was a German-American Marxist political writer, political philosopher and social revolutionary, whose thought can be placed within the council communist and left communist traditions.

Throughout his life, Mattick continually criticised Bolshevism, Vladimir Lenin and Leninist organisational methods, describing their political legacy as &quot;serving as a mere ideology to justify the rise of modified capitalist (state-capitalist) systems, which were [...] controlled by way of an authoritarian state&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in SÅupsk, Pomerania in 1904 and raised in Berlin by class-conscious parents, Mattick was already at the age of 14 a member of the Spartacists&#x27; . In 1918, he started to study as a toolmaker at Siemens AG, where he was also elected as the apprentices&#x27; delegate on the workers&#x27; council of the company during the German Revolution.

Implicated in many actions during the revolution, arrested several times and threatened with death, Mattick radicalized along the left and oppositional trend of the German communists. After the &quot;Heidelberg split&quot; of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD; a successor to the Spartacist League) and the formation for the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) in the spring of 1920, he entered the KAPD and worked in the youth organization &quot;Rote Jugend&quot;, writing for its journal. In March 1920 he participated in street fighting against the rightist Kapp Putsch, in which his lifelong friend Reinhold Klingenberg was shot and lost a leg.

In 1921, at the age of 17, Mattick moved to Cologne to find work with Klockner for a while, until strikes, insurrections and a new arrest destroyed every prospect of employment. He was active as an organizer and agitator in the KAPD and the AAU in the Cologne region, where he got to know Jan Appel among others. He also established contacts with intellectuals, writers and artists working in the AAUE founded by Otto RÃ¼hle. These included the Cologne Progressives, a group formed around Franz Seiwert.

With the continuing decline of radical mass struggle and revolutionary hopes, especially after 1923, and having been unemployed for a number of years, Mattick emigrated to the United States in 1926, whilst still maintaining contacts with the KAPD and the AAUE in Germany.

== In the United States ==
In the United States, Mattick carried through a more systematic theoretical study, above all of Karl Marx. In addition, the publication of Henryk Grossman&#x27;s principal work, (1929), played a fundamental role for Mattick, as Grossman brought Marx&#x27;s theory of accumulation, which had been completely forgotten, back to the centre of debate in the workers&#x27; movement. To Mattick, Marx&#x27;s &quot;critique of political economy&quot; became not a purely theoretical matter but rather directly connected to his own revolutionary practice. From this time, Mattick focused on Marx&#x27;s theory of capitalist development and its inner logic of contradictions inevitably growing to crisis as the foundation of all political thoughts within the workers&#x27; movement.

Towards the end of the 1920s, Mattick had moved to Chicago, where he first tried to unite the different German workers&#x27; organisations. Taking night classes to improve his English, Mattick fell into the orbit of the Proletarian Party, a cliquish grouping of independent Marxists which had been successively drummed out of the Socialist Party (in 1919) and the Communist Party (in 1920), now going it alone with their own party organization. Mattick participated in their meetings and contributed to their party publications for several years, during which he also sometimes spoke in the nighttime lecture series at the bohemian Dil Pickle Club, an IWW hangout. In 1931, under the sponsorship of a local federation of German-speaking socialist clubs and sports groups, he took over as editor of the defunct German-language &quot;Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, a newspaper steeped in radical tradition and at one time edited by August Spies and Joseph Dietzgen. Mattick put out 10 monthly issues between February and December 1931, writing much of the paper&#x27;s content himself, but the paper failed to achieve a large enough readership to be self-sustaining, and folded at the end of the year. For a period, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World (known as the IWW or Wobblies), who were the only revolutionary union organization existing in America that, in spite of national or sectoral differences, assembled all workers in One Big Union, so as to prepare the general strike to bring down capitalism. However, the golden age of the Wobblies&#x27; militant strikes had already passed by the beginning of the thirties, and only the emerging unemployed movement again gave the IWW a brief regional development. In 1933, Paul Mattick drafted a programme for the IWW trying to give the Wobblies a more solid &#x27;Marxist&#x27; foundation based on Grossman&#x27;s theory, although it did not improve the organization&#x27;s condition. In 1934, Mattick, some friends from the IWW as well as some expellees from the Leninist Proletarian Party formed the United Workers Party, later to be renamed Group of Council Communists. The group kept close contacts with the remaining small groups of the German/Dutch Left communism in Europe and published the journal &quot;International Council Correspondence&quot;, which through the 1930s became an Anglo-American parallel to the of the Dutch GIC(H). Articles and debates from Europe were translated along with economic analysis and critical political comments of current issues in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

Apart from his own factory work, Mattick organized not only most of the review&#x27;s technical work but was also the author of the greater part of the contributions which appeared in it. Among the few willing to offer regular contributions was Karl Korsch, with whom Mattick had come into contact in 1935 and who remained a personal friend for many years from the time of his emigration to the United States at the end of 1936.

As European council communism went underground and formally &quot;disappeared&quot; in the second half of the 1930s, Mattick changed &quot;Correspondence&quot;&#x27;s name from 1938 to &quot;Living Marxism&quot; and from 1942 to &quot;New Essays&quot;.

Like Karl Korsch and Henryk Grossman, Mattick had some contact with Max Horkheimer&#x27;s Institut fur Sozialforschung (the later Frankfurt School). In 1936, Mattick wrote a major sociological study on the American unemployed movement for the Institute, although it remained in the Institute&#x27;s files, to be published only in 1969 by the SDS publishing house Neue Kritik.

== World War II and after ==
After the United States&#x27; entry into World War II and the post-war Mccarthyism, the left in America experienced repression. Mattick retired at the beginning of the 1950s to the countryside, as part of the rustic &quot;back to the land&quot; colony clustered around Scott Nearing near Winhall, Vermont, where he managed to survive through occasional jobs and his activity as a writer. In the postwar development Mattick took part in only small and occasional political activities, writing small articles for various periodicals from time to time. From the forties and up through the fifties, Mattick went through a study of John Maynard Keynes and compiled a series of critical notes and articles against Keynesian theory and practice. In this work, he developed Marx&#x27;s and Grossman&#x27;s theory of capitalist development further to meet the new phenomena and appearances of the modern capitalism critically.

With the general changes of the political scene and the re-emergence of more radical thoughts in the sixties, Paul Mattick made some more elaborated and important political contributions. One main work was &quot;Marx and Keynes: The Limits of Mixed Economy&quot; from 1969, which was translated into several languages and had quite an influence in the post-1968 student movement. Another important work was &quot;Critique of Herbert Marcuse: The one-dimensional man in class society&quot;, in which Mattick forcefully rejected Marcuse&#x27;s thesis that the proletariat, as Marx understood it, had become a &quot;mythological concept&quot; in advanced capitalist society. Although he agreed with Marcuse&#x27;s critical analysis of the ruling ideology, Mattick demonstrated that the theory of one dimensionality itself existed only as ideology. Marcuse subsequently affirmed that Mattick&#x27;s was the best critique to which his book was subjected.

== Later life ==
Up through the seventies, many old and new articles by Mattick were published in different languages for various publications. In the academic year 1974-75, Mattick was engaged as visiting professor at the &quot;Red&quot; Roskilde University in Denmark. Here, he held lectures on Marx&#x27; critique of political economy, on the history of the workers movement and served as critical co-referent at seminars with other guests such as Maximilien Rubel, Ernest Mandel, Joan Robinson and others. In 1977, he completed his last important lecture tour of the University of Mexico City. He spoke in West Germany only twice: in 1971 at Berlin and in 1975 at Hanover. In his last years, Mattick thus succeeded in getting a small audience within the new generations for his views.

===&quot;Anti-Bolshevik Communism&quot;===
In 1978, a major collection of articles by Mattick from over forty years appeared as &quot;Anti-Bolshevik Communism&quot;, published by Merlin Press. It consisted of twelve articles:
* 1939: &quot;Karl Kautsky: From Marx to Hitler&quot;
* 1935: &quot;Luxemburg versus Lenin&quot; (&quot;Council Correspondence&quot; Vol. 2, no. 1, December 1935)
* 1935: &quot;The Lenin Legend&quot; (&quot;Council Correspondence&quot; Vol. 2, no. 1, December 1935)
* 1947: &quot;Bolshevism and Stalinism&quot;, abridged from original in &quot;Politics&quot;, Vol. 4, No. 2, Mar/Apr 1947
* 1939: &quot;Council Communism&quot;, originally as &quot;Groups of Council Communists&quot; in &quot;The Social Frontier&quot;, vol. 5, no. 45, May 1939
* 1945: &quot;Otto RÃ¼hle and the German Labour Movement&quot;
* 1949: &quot;Spontaneity and Organisation&quot;
* 1962: &quot;Karl Korsch: His Contribution to Revolutionary Marxism&quot;
* 1965: &quot;Humanism and Socialism&quot;, &quot;International Socialism&quot; (1st series), No.22, Autumn 1965
* 1960: &quot;Marxism and the New Physics&quot;
* 1966: &quot;Monopoly Capital&quot;
* 1967: &quot;Workers&#x27; Control&quot;

Mattick died in February 1981 leaving an almost finished manuscript for another book, which was later edited and published by his son, Paul Mattick, Jr., as &quot;Marxism - Last Refuge of the Bourgeoisie?&quot;.

<text>Brennschluss (a loanword, from the German &quot;Brennschluss&quot;) is either the cessation of fuel burning in a rocket or the time that the burning ceases: the cessation may result from the consumption of the propellants, from deliberate shutoff, or from some other cause. After Brennschluss, the rocket is subject only to external forces, notably that due to gravity.

According to Walter Dornberger, Brennschluss literally meant &quot;end of burning,&quot; He goes on to state, &quot;the German word is preferred to the form &#x27;all-burnt,&#x27; which is used in England, because at Brennschluss considerable quantities of fuel may still be left in the tanks.&quot;

==Cultural references==
The term &quot;Brennschluss&quot; is used in various English literary works, including:
* The science fiction short story &quot;Honeymoon in Hell&quot; (1950) by Fredric Brown
* The science fiction short story &quot;Desire No More&quot; (1954) by Algis Budrys

<doc id="703078" wikidata="Q1152241" url="?curid=703078" title="Twill">
<text>Twill is a type of textile weave with a pattern of parallel, diagonal ribs. It is one of three fundamental types of weave, along with plain weave and satin. It is made by passing the weft thread over one or more warp threads then under two or more warp threads and so on, with a &quot;step&quot;, or offset, between rows to create the characteristic diagonal pattern. Because of this structure, twill generally drapes well.

== Classification ==
Twill weaves can be classified from four points of view:

# According to the stepping:
#* &quot;Warp-way&quot;: 3/1 warp way twill, etc.
#* &quot;Weft-way&quot;: 2/3 weft way twill, etc.
# According to the direction of twill lines on the face of the fabric:
#* &quot;S-twill&quot;, or &quot;left-hand twill weave&quot;: 2/1 S, etc.
#* &quot;Z-twill&quot;, or &quot;right-hand twill weave&quot;: 3/2 Z, etc.
# According to the face yarn (warp or weft):
#* &quot;Warp face twill weave&quot;: 4/2 S, etc.
#* &quot;Weft face twill weave&quot;: 1/3 Z, etc.
#* &quot;Double face&quot; twill weave&quot;: 3/3 Z, etc.
# According to the nature of the produced twill line:
#* &quot;Simple twill weave&quot;: 1/2 S, 3/1 Z etc. 
#* &quot;Expanded twill weave&quot;: 4/3 S, 3/2 Z, etc.
#* &quot;Multiple twill weave&quot;: 2/3/3/1 S, etc.

==Structure==
In a twill weave, each weft or filling yarn floats across the warp yarns in a progression of interlacings to the right or left, forming a pattern of distinct diagonal lines. This diagonal pattern is also known as a &quot;wale&quot;. A &quot;float&quot; is the portion of a yarn that crosses over two or more perpendicular yarns.

A twill weave requires three or more harnesses, depending on its complexity and is the second most basic weave that can be made on a fairly simple loom.

Twill weave is often designated as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of harnesses that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of harnesses that are lowered when a filling yarn is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction is read as &quot;two up, one down&quot; (the fraction for plain weave is .). The minimum number of harnesses needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of harnesses is three. Twill weave can be identified by its diagonal lines.

==Characteristics==
Twill fabrics technically have a front and a back side, unlike plain weave, whose two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is called the &quot;technical face&quot;, and the back the &quot;technical back&quot;. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale; it is usually more durable and more attractive, is most often used as the fashion side of the fabric, and is the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (i.e. if the warp crosses over two or more wefts), there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back. If the twill wale goes up to the right on one side, it will go up to the left on the other side. Twill fabrics have no &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; as they are woven.

Sheer fabrics are seldom made with a twill weave. Because a twill surface already has interesting texture and design, printed twills (where a design is printed on the cloth) are much less common than printed plain weaves. When twills are printed, this is typically done on lightweight fabrics.

Soiling and stains are less noticeable on the uneven surface of twills than on a smooth surface, such as plain weaves, and as a result twills are often used for sturdy work clothing and for durable upholsteryâdenim, for example, is a twill. In addition, twill&#x27;s durability, wrinkle-resistance, and low maintenance make it ideal for a range of other items, such as jackets, pants, backpacks, and even draperies.

The fewer interlacings in twills as compared to other weaves allow the yarns to move more freely, and therefore they are softer and more pliable, and drape better than plain-weave textiles. Twills also recover from creasing better than plain-weave fabrics do. When there are fewer interlacings, the yarns can be packed closer together to produce high-count fabrics. With higher counts, including high-count twills, the fabric is more durable, and is air- and water-resistant.

Twills can be divided into &quot;even-sided&quot;, &quot;warp-faced&quot;, and &quot;weft-faced&quot;. Even-sided twills have the same amount of warp and weft threads visible on both sides of the fabric. Warp-faced twills have more warp threads visible on the face side, and weft-faced twills have more weft threads visible on the face side. Even-sided twills include foulard or surah, herringbone, houndstooth, serge, sharkskin, and twill flannel. Warp-faced twills include cavalry twill, chino, covert, denim, drill, fancy twill, gabardine, and lining twill.

<doc id="703098" wikidata="Q7315838" url="?curid=703098" title="Resource rent">
<text>In economics, rent is a surplus value after all costs and normal returns have been accounted for, i.e. the difference between the price at which an output from a resource can be sold and its respective extraction and production costs, including normal return. This concept is usually termed economic rent but when referring to rent in natural resources such as coastal space or minerals, it is commonly called resource rent. It can also be conceptualised as abnormal or supernormal profit.

In practice, identifying and measuring (or collecting) resource rent is not straightforward. At any point in time, rent depends on the availability of information, market conditions, technology and the system of property rights used to govern access to and management of resources.

==Categories of rent==
Rent can be categorised into different kinds depending on how it is created. In general one can distinguish three different kinds of rent, which can also occur together: differential, scarcity, and entrepreneurial rent.

* Differential rent (also called quality or Ricardian rent) arises because of differences in the quality of similar goods or inputs (e.g. production sites). Consider two companies that extract coal of identical quality. The market price of coal is $50/t. Company X operates at a production site where it is very easy to extract coal. Its costs (including normal returns) amount to $20/t. Company Y operates at a site where it is relatively difficult to extract coal. Its costs (including normal returns) amount to $30/t. Company X will âcreateâ more resource rent because of the more accessible resource.
* Scarcity rent The marginal opportunity cost imposed on future generations by extracting one more unit of a resource today. Scarcity rent is one of two costs the extraction of a finite resource imposes on society. The other is marginal extraction cost--the opportunity cost of resources employed in the extraction activity. Scarcity rent is the cost of &quot;using up&quot; a finite resource because benefits of the extracted resource are unavailable to future generations. Efficiency is achieved when the resource price--the benefit society is willing to pay for the resource today--is equal to the sum of marginal extraction cost and scarcity rent.
* Entrepreneurial rent (also called quasi-rent or Schumpeterian rent) can accrue due to entrepreneurial skills or managerial investments. A company may invest in advertising, training of employees, and so forth. These investments can result in a higher price (brand) or lower costs (better technology). Consider the âproductionâ of rock lobster where the costs to produce one rock lobster (i.e. paying for labour, the nets, and the like, and including normal profit) amount to $3. Assume the rock lobster is sold for $5 on the market. Resource rent here amounts to $2. However, assume the fisher has managed to decrease the costs for catching rock lobster from $3 to $2. This could be due to his/her entrepreneurial skills and more efficient use of labour and capital. Resource rent increases from $2 to $3.

== Payment of royalties ==
A landowner who holds oil or mineral rights to his property may transfer those rights under a license to another party. In exchange for allowing another party to extract resources, the landowner receives either a resource rent or a &quot;license fee&quot; based on the value of the resources sold. When the government owns the resource, the transaction often must comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. 

The calculation of the value of oil and gas royalties involves estimating future revenues based on recent production trends. A common method is to take the average monthly income for the last three months and use that as a basis for forecasting. 

In the United States, simple ownership of mineral rights is possible, and royalty payments to individuals are quite common. Local taxing authorities may levy a severance tax on non-renewable natural resources extracted or withdrawn within their authority. The federal government receives royalties for mining on federal lands, which is managed by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, formerly the Minerals Management Service. 

An example from Canada&#x27;s northern territories is the federal rules on royalties for oil in border lands. The royalty rate begins at 1% of gross sales for the first 18 months of commercial production and increases by 1% every 18 months up to a maximum of 5% until initial costs are recovered, after which the royalty rate is set at 5% of gross sales or 30% of net sales. Thus, the risks and profits are shared between the Government of Canada (as the owner of the resources) and the oil developer. This attractive royalty rate is designed to incentivize oil and gas exploration in Canada&#x27;s remote frontier areas, where costs and risks are higher than elsewhere.

<doc id="703104" wikidata="Q478220" url="?curid=703104" title="List of Welsh areas by percentage of Welsh-speakers">
<text>This is a list of subdivisions of Wales by the percentage of those professing some skills in the Welsh language in the 2011 UK census. The census did not record Welsh-speakers living outside Wales.

The census determined that 18.56% of the population could speak Welsh and 14.57% could speak, read and write in the language. In the most recent census in 2021, 17.8% reported being able to speak Welsh. 

==Census breakdown==
The Census produced a detailed breakdown of skills as: 
*Understands spoken Welsh (no other skills)
*Speaks but does not read or write Welsh
*Speaks and reads but does not write Welsh
*Speaks, reads and writes Welsh
*Other combination of skills; e.g. Can read but not speak.
*No knowledge of Welsh.

==Those with the ability to speak Welsh==
The second table includes only those people who stated in the 2011 Census that they are able to speak the Welsh language. It was these statistics that were reported by the press when the first data samples were released in 2012.



==Those with knowledge of the Welsh language==
For the purpose of the first table, all combinations other than &quot;no knowledge of Welsh&quot; have been combined, giving a percentage of people that state they have some communication skills in the Welsh language rather than an ability to speak Welsh. The totals include children whose parents have filled in the Census details on this behalf.


==Annual Population Survey estimates==

In addition to official Census data, the Annual Population Survey publishes sample-based estimates on the number of self-proclaimed Welsh speakers several times a year based on estimates for the previous year. The third table displays uses this data to show estimates for the percentage of people who say they can speak Welsh at the time of each survey, from June 2016 onwards.
The 2020 survey reported that 28.6% of people in Wales aged three and over were able to speak Welsh.

<doc id="703105" wikidata="Q42377786" url="?curid=703105" title="Abnormal profit">
<text>In economics, abnormal profit, also called excess profit, supernormal profit or pure profit, is &quot;profit of a firm over and above what provides its owners with a normal (market equilibrium) return to capital.&quot; Normal profit (return) in turn is defined as opportunity cost of the owner&#x27;s resources. A related broader term is economic rent, which applies to the owner of a resource, such as land, rather than to the firm as such.

According to the theoretical model of perfect competition, abnormal profits are unsustainable because they stimulate new supply, which forces down prices and eliminates the abnormal profit. Abnormal profit persists in the long run in imperfectly competitive markets where firms successfully block the entry of new firms. Abnormal profit is usually generated by an oligopoly or a monopoly; however, firms often try to hide this fact, both from the market and government, in order to reduce the chance of competition, or government intervention in the form of an antitrust investigation.

In principle, there are three kinds of abnormal profit:
*Monopoly profit
*Resource rent
*Intramarginal rent.

Business writer Michael Porter and Anita M. McGahan undertook an empirical study of the &quot;emergence and sustainability of abnormal profits&quot; in 2003, in which they concluded that both industry structure and firm performance were determinants of whether abnormal profits could be sustained by firms.

<text>Michael Chaturantabut (born April 30, 1975) is a Thai American actor, martial artist and stuntman, best known for his role as Chad Lee, the Blue Ranger in &quot;Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue&quot;. He was born in Rayong Province, Thailand.

==Extreme martial arts==
&quot;Xtreme Martial Arts&quot; or &quot;XMA&quot; is a brand name owned by Chaturantabut. Chaturantabut&#x27;s XMA is a combination of elements from martial arts, acrobatics and gymnastics, with an emphasis on showmanship.

The concept of adding gymnastics-like tumbling moves to elements of traditional martial arts is otherwise known as &quot;tricking&quot;. XMA makes these exhibition moves the focus of the sport. Open hand and weapons choreography are often accompanied by dramatic dance or programmatic music. The goal is to command the attention of the audience.

Currently there are schools of martial arts or similar XMA styles based in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the World Headquarters being in North Hollywood, California. Many of the moves are high-flying aerial acrobatic maneuvers. These stunning movements attain the goal of capturing the crowd, improving physical agility, balance, strength, coordination, and endurance, as well as performing an artistic display of talent.

He feels that there are many basic moves that can be specialized to be more acrobatic, flashy and artistic, so as to give the impression of complexity and difficulty for showmanship purposes. It is for this reason that he feels that even the basic athlete or beginner can learn the progression from basic moves to highly complex acrobatic sequences.

==Filmography==
==Personal life==
Chaturantabut was trained at Sharkey&#x27;s Karate Studios located in Naperville and Momence, Illinois. He was formerly married to McKenzie Satterthwaite and is also the founder of Extreme Martial Arts.

Chaturantabut is also the father of two sons, Talin and Gaige.

Chatrantabut attended Naperville North High School in Naperville, Illinois.

==Notable facts==
Chaturantabut was also Taylor Lautner&#x27;s martial artist coach and encouraged him to get into acting.

<text>William Edgar Borah (June 29, 1865Â â January 19, 1940) was an outspoken Republican United States Senator, one of the best-known figures in Idaho&#x27;s history. A progressive who served from 1907 until his death in 1940, Borah is often considered an isolationist, because he led the Irreconcilables, senators who would not accept the Treaty of Versailles, Senate ratification of which would have made the U.S. part of the League of Nations.

Borah was born in rural Illinois to a large farming family. He studied at the University of Kansas and became a lawyer in that state before seeking greater opportunities in Idaho. He quickly rose in the law and in state politics, and after a failed run for the House of Representatives in 1896 and one for the United States Senate in 1903, was elected to the Senate in 1907. Before he took his seat in December of that year, he was involved in two prominent legal cases. One, the murder conspiracy trial of Big Bill Haywood, gained Borah fame though Haywood was found not guilty and the other, a prosecution of Borah for land fraud, made him appear a victim of political malice even before his acquittal.

In the Senate, Borah became one of the progressive insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft&#x27;s policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican presidents in office between 1921 and 1933, though Calvin Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Herbert Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again.

Deprived of his post as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the Democrats took control of the Senate in 1933, Borah agreed with some of the New Deal legislation, but opposed other proposals. He ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1936, but party regulars were not inclined to allow a longtime maverick to head the ticket. In his final years, he felt he might be able to settle differences in Europe by meeting with Hitler; though he did not go, this has not enhanced his historical reputation. Borah died in 1940; his statue, presented by the state of Idaho in 1947, stands in the National Statuary Hall Collection.

== Childhood and early career ==
William Edgar Borah was born in Jasper Township, Illinois, near Fairfield in Wayne County. His parents were farmers Elizabeth (West) and William Nathan Borah. Borah was distantly related to Katharina von Bora, the Catholic nun who left her convent in the 16th century and married reformer Martin Luther. His Borah ancestors came to America in about 1760, fought in the Revolutionary War, and moved west with the frontier. The young William E. Borah was the seventh of ten children, and the third son.

Although Borah was not a good student, at an early age he began to love oratory and the written word. Borah was educated at Tom&#x27;s Prairie School, near Fairfield. When Borah exhausted its rudimentary resources, his father sent him in 1881 to Southern Illinois Academy, a Cumberland Presbyterian academy at Enfield, to train for the ministry. The 63 students there included two future U.S. senators, Borah and Wesley Jones, who would represent the state of Washington; the two often debated as schoolboys. Instead of becoming a preacher, Borah was in 1882 expelled for hitching rides on the Illinois Central to spend the night in the town of Carmi.

He ran away from home with an itinerant Shakespearean company, but his father persuaded him to return. In his late teenage years, he became interested in the law, and later stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t want to be a lawyerÂ ... there is no other profession where one can be absolutely independent&quot;.

With his father finally accepting his ambition to be a lawyer rather than a clergyman, Borah in 1883 went to live with his sister Sue in Lyons, Kansas; her husband, Ansel M. Lasley, was an attorney. Borah initially worked as a teacher, but became so engrossed in historical topics at the town library that he was ill-prepared for class; he and the school parted ways. In 1885 Borah enrolled at the University of Kansas, and rented an inexpensive room in a professor&#x27;s home in Lawrence; he studied alongside students who would become prominent, such as William Allen White and Fred Funston. Borah was working his way through college, but his plans were scuttled when he contracted tuberculosis in early 1887. He had to return to Lyons, where his sister nursed him to health, and he began to read law under his brother-in-law Lasley&#x27;s supervision. Borah passed the bar examination in September 1887, and went into partnership with his brother-in-law.

The mayor of Lyons appointed Borah as city attorney in 1889, but the young lawyer felt that he was destined for bigger things than a small Kansas town suffering in the hard times that persisted on the prairie in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Following the advice attributed to Horace Greeley, Borah chose to go west and grow up with the country. In October 1890, uncertain of his destination, he boarded the Union Pacific Railroad in Omaha. On the advice of a gambler on board the train, Borah decided to settle in Boise, Idaho. His biographer, Marian C. McKenna, said that Boise was &quot;as far west as his pocketbook would take him&quot;.

== Pre-Senate career ==

=== Idaho lawyer ===
Idaho had been admitted to the Union earlier in 1890, and Boise, the state capital, was a boom town, where the police and courts were not yet fully effective. Borah&#x27;s first case was referred to him by the gambler who had advised him on board the train; the young attorney was asked to defend a man accused of murder for shooting a Chinese immigrant in the back. Borah gained an unasked-for dismissal when the judge decided that killing a Chinese male was at worst manslaughter. Borah prospered in Boise, both in law and in politics. In 1892 he served as chair of the Republican State Central Committee. He served as political secretary to Governor William J. McConnell. In 1895 Borah married the governor&#x27;s daughter, Mary McConnell. They were married until Borah&#x27;s death, but had no children together.

Idaho, a mining state, was fraught with labor tensions, and related violence was common by both employers and workers. In 1899, there was a strike, and a large group of miners dynamited facilities belonging to a mining company that refused to recognize the union. They had hijacked a train to travel to destroy the company&#x27;s plant. Someone in the mob shot and killed a strikebreaker. Governor Frank Steunenberg declared martial law and had more than one thousand miners arrested. Paul Corcoran, secretary of the union, was charged with murder. Borah was engaged as a prosecutor in a trial that began at Wallace on July 8, 1899. Prosecution witnesses testified to having seen Corcoran sitting on top of the train, rifle in hand, and later leaping to the platform. The defense contended that, given the sharp curves and rough roadbed of the rail line, no one could have sat on top of the train, nor jumped from it without severe injury. Borah took the jury to the train line and demonstrated how Corcoran could have acted. He drew on his skills as a teenage rail rider to ride the top of the train, and jump from it to the platform without injury. Corcoran was convicted, but his death sentence was commuted. He was pardoned in 1901, after Steunenberg left office. Borah gained wide acclaim for his dramatic prosecution of the case.

=== Senate contender ===
In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, including Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party to support the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryanâfree silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican in opposition to the campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning. He concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Duboisâuntil 1913, state legislatures chose senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.

In 1898, Borah supported the SpanishâAmerican War and remained loyal to the Silver Republicans. By 1900, Borah deemed the silver issue of minimal importance due to increased gold production and national prosperity. With other former silverites, he made an unapologetic return to the Republican Party. He made speeches for McKinley, who was re-elected. Bryan, however, took Idaho&#x27;s electoral votes for a second time. Dubois, though nominally remaining a Silver Republican, gained control of the state Democratic Party, and was returned to the US Senate by the Idaho Legislature.

Borah&#x27;s legal practice had made him prominent in southern Idaho, and in 1902 he sought election to the Senate. By this time, a united Republican Party was deemed likely to defeat the Democratic/Populist combine that had ruled Idaho for the past six years. The 1902 Idaho state Republican convention showed that Borah had, likely, the most support among the people, but the choice of senator was generally dictated by the caucus of the majority party in the legislature. In the 1902 election, Republicans retook control, electing a governor of their party, as well as the state&#x27;s only House member and a large majority in the legislature. Three other Republicans were seeking the Senate seat, including Weldon B. Heyburn, a mining lawyer from the northern part of the state. When the legislature met in early 1903, Borah led on early caucus ballots, but then the other candidates withdrew and backed Heyburn; he was chosen by the caucus, and then by the legislature. There were many rumors of corruption in the choice of Heyburn, and Borah determined that the defeat would not end his political career. He decided to seek the seat of Senator Dubois (by then a Democrat) when it was filled by the legislature in early 1907.

At the state convention at Pocatello in 1904, Borah made a speech in support of the election of Theodore Roosevelt for a full term as president, which was widely applauded. But the Old Guard Republicans in Idaho opposed him and they were determined to defeat Borah in his second bid for the Senate. The same year, Dubois damaged his prospects for a third term by his opposition to the appointment of H. Smith Woolley, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (many Idahoans adhered to that faith), as assayer-in-charge of the United States Assay Office at Boise. Dubois had advanced politically through anti-Mormonism in the 1880s, but the issue was more or less dead in Idaho by 1904. Woolley was confirmed by the U.S. Senate despite Dubois&#x27;s opposition, and Rufus G. Cook, in his article on the affair, suggested that Dubois was baited into acting by Borah and his supporters. The result was that Borah attacked Dubois for anti-Mormonism in both 1904 and 1906, which played well in the heavily Mormon counties in southeast Idaho.

Borah campaigned to end the caucus&#x27;s role in selecting the Republican nominee for Senate, arguing that it should be decided by the people, in a convention. He drafted a resolution based on the one passed by the 1858 Illinois Republican convention that had endorsed Abraham Lincoln for Senate in his unsuccessful race against Stephen Douglas. He made a deal with a potential Republican rival, Governor Frank Gooding, whereby Borah would be nominated for Senate and Gooding for re-election and on August 1, 1906, both men received the state convention&#x27;s endorsement by acclamation. Dubois was the Democratic choice, and Borah campaigned in support of President Roosevelt, argued that Republicans had brought the nation prosperity, and urged law and order. Voters re-elected Gooding, and selected a Republican legislature, which in January 1907 retired Dubois by electing Borah to the Senate.

=== Haywood trial, lumber accusations ===

Borah presented his credentials at the Senate prior to the formal beginning of his first term on March 4, 1907. Until 1933, Congress&#x27;s regular session began in December, allowing Borah time to participate in two major trials. One of these boosted him to national prominence for his role in the prosecution of Big Bill Haywood, and the other, with Borah as the defendant, placed him at risk of going to prison.

Haywood was tried for conspiracy in the murder of ex-governor Steunenberg, who was assassinated on December 30, 1905, by a bomb planted on the gate at his home in Caldwell. Borah, who viewed Steunenberg as a father figure, was among the prominent Idahoans who hurried to Caldwell, and who viewed Steunenberg&#x27;s shattered body and the bloodstained snow. Suspicion quickly fell on a man registered at a local hotel who proved to be Harry Orchard, an explosives expert and assassin. Many labor leaders were embittered against Steunenberg for his actions while in office, and Orchard implicated four of them. The three who could be found, including Haywood, were extradited from Colorado to Idaho in February 1906. As the legal challenges wound through the courts, the case became a campaign issue both for Gooding, who had signed the extradition warrant, and for Borah, who joined the prosecution team and stated that trying the case was more important to him than being sent to the Senate.

While the Haywood defendants awaited trial, Borah and others were indicted in federal court for land fraud, having to do with the acquisition by the Barber Lumber Company (for which Borah had been counsel) of title to timber land claims. Individuals had filed for the claims, and then sold them to the Barber Company, although they had sworn that the claims were for their own use. United States Attorney for Idaho, Norman M. Ruick, had expanded the grand jury from 12 members to 22 before he could get a majority vote to indict Borah (by a 12â10 margin). The indictment was perceived to be political, with Ruick acting on behalf of Idaho Republicans who had lost state party leadership to the new senator. Roosevelt took a wait-and-see attitude, upsetting Borah, who considered resigning his Senate seat even if exonerated.

Haywood was the first tried of the three defendants; jury selection began on May 9, 1907, and proceedings in Boise continued for over two months. The courtroom, corridors, and even the lawn outside were often filled. Counsel for the prosecution included Borah and future governor James H. Hawley; famed attorney Clarence Darrow led the defense team. A highlight of the trial was Borah&#x27;s cross-examination of Haywood, who denied personal animus against Steunenberg and any connection with the death. Another was Borah&#x27;s final argument for the prosecution in rebuttal to Darrow on July 25 and 26.

Borah recalled the night of the ex-governor&#x27;s murder:
Although Darrow won the day, gaining an acquittal for Haywood, the trial transformed Borah from an obscure freshman senator into a national figure. But Borah still had to face a jury on the land fraud charge, which he did in September 1907, a trial held then at Roosevelt&#x27;s insistenceâRuick had asked for more time, but Borah wanted the matter disposed of before Congress met in December. Borah refused to challenge the indictment. At the trial, his counsel allowed Ruick free rein; the judge commented on Ruick&#x27;s inability to tie Borah to any offense. The defense case consisted almost entirely of Borah&#x27;s testimony, and the jury quickly acquitted him, setting off wild celebrations in Boise. Roosevelt dismissed Ruick as US Attorney in 1908.

== Senator (1907â1940) ==
=== Progressive insurgent (1907â1913) ===
When Borah went to Washington for the Senate&#x27;s regular session in December 1907, he was immediately a figure of note, not only for the dramatic events in Idaho but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was customary then for junior senators to wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt&#x27;s request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president&#x27;s dismissal of more than 200 African-American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair in Texas. The cause of their innocence had been pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were accused of having shot up a Texas town near their military camp. Borah said that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later re-investigated. The government concluded that the soldiers had been accused because of racist officials in the town and, in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, their dishonorable discharges from the military were reversed.

Republican leaders had heard that Borah was an attorney for corporations, who had prosecuted labor leaders; they believed him sympathetic to their Old Guard positions and assigned him to important committees. Borah believed in the rights of unions, so long as they did not commit violent acts. When Borah staked out progressive positions after his swearing-in, Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich, the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, hoped to put pressure on him through the Westerner&#x27;s corporate clients, only to find that he had given up those representations before coming to Washington. Borah became one of a growing number of progressive Republicans in the Senate. Yet, Borah often opposed liberal legislation, finding fault with it or fearing it would increase the power of the federal government. Throughout his years in the Senate, in which he would serve until his death in 1940, his idiosyncratic positions would limit his effectiveness as a reformer.

After Roosevelt&#x27;s hand-picked successor as president, former Secretary of War William Howard Taft, was inaugurated in March 1909, Congress battled over what became the PayneâAldrich Tariff. At the time, tariffs were the main source of government revenue, and conflicts over them were passionate. The party platform had promised tariff reform, which progressive insurgents like Borah took to mean tariff reductions. Old Guard legislators like Senator Aldrich disagreed, and the final version actually raised rates by about one percent. The battles alienated Borah from Taft, who in a speech at Winona, Minnesota, described the new law as the best tariff the country had ever had. Borah and other progressives had proposed an income tax to be attached to the tariff bill; when this was unacceptable to Taft, who feared the Supreme Court would strike it down again, Borah repackaged it as a constitutional amendment, which passed the Senate unanimously and then the House, and to the surprise of many, passed the requisite number of state legislatures by 1913 to become the Sixteenth Amendment.

Borah also had a hand in the other constitutional amendment to be ratified in 1913, the Seventeenth Amendment, providing for the direct election of senators by the people. In 1909, due to Borah&#x27;s influence, the Idaho Legislature passed an act for a statewide election for US senators, with legislators in theory bound to choose the winner. By 1912 over 30 states had similar laws. Borah promoted the amendment in the Senate in 1911 and 1912 until it passed Congress and, after a year, it was ratified by the states. With the power to elect senators having passed to the people, according to McKenna, the popular Borah &quot;secured for himself a life option on a seat in the Senate&quot;.

Borah opposed Taft over a number of issues and in March 1912 announced his support of the candidacy of Roosevelt over Taft for the Republican presidential nomination. Most delegates to the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago selected by primary supported Roosevelt, but as most states held conventions to select delegates, Taft&#x27;s control of the party machinery gave him the advantage. A number of states, especially in the South, had contested delegate seats, matters which would be initially settled by the Republican National Committee. Borah was Idaho&#x27;s Republican National Committeeman and was one of those designated by the Roosevelt campaign to fight for it on the RNC. As Taft controlled the committee, Borah found few victories. Borah was among those who tried to find a compromise candidate, and was spoken of for that role, but all such efforts failed.

When it became clear Taft would be renominated, Roosevelt and his supporters bolted the party; the former president asked Borah to chair the organizational meeting of his new Progressive Party, but the Idahoan refused. Borah would not countenance leaving the Republican Party and did not support any of the presidential candidates (the Democrats nominated New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson). When Roosevelt came to Boise on a campaign swing in October, Borah felt he had to greet the former president and sit on the platform as Roosevelt spoke, though he was unwilling to endorse him. Roosevelt told in his speech of a long list of state delegate votes he said had been stolen from him, and after each, turned to Borah and asked, &quot;Isn&#x27;t that so, Senator Borah?&quot; giving him no choice but to nod. It is not clear whether Borah voted for Roosevelt or Taft, he later stated both at different times. The main issue in Idaho was Borah&#x27;s re-election, which was so popular that those disgruntled at the senator for not supporting Taft or Roosevelt kept quiet. Idahoans helped elect Wilson, but sent 80 Republican legislators out of 86 to Boise (with two of the six Democrats pledged to support Borah if necessary), who on January 14, 1913, returned William Borah for a second term.

=== Wilson years ===
==== Prewar (1913â1917) ====
The Republicans both lost the presidency with Wilson&#x27;s inauguration and went into the minority in the Senate. In the reshuffle of committee assignments that followed, Borah was given a seat on Foreign Relations. He would occupy it for the next quarter century, becoming one of America&#x27;s leading figures on international affairs.

Borah generally approved of many of Wilson&#x27;s proposals, but found reasons to vote against them. He voted against the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (believing it was a handout to the rich), after gaining a concession that no banker would initially be appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. Borah believed monopolies, public and private, should be broken up, and believed the new Federal Trade Commission would prove a means for trusts to control their regulators; he voted against the bill and stated he would not support confirmation of the first commissioners. The Clayton Antitrust Act, Borah opined, was merely a means by which Congress could appear to be dealing with the trusts without actually doing so.

In 1913 and early 1914, Borah clashed with Wilson and his Secretary of State, Bryan, over Latin American policy. Borah believed that there was an ongoing temptation for the U.S. to expand into Latin America, which the construction of the Panama Canal had made worse. If the U.S. did so, the local population would have to be subjugated or incorporated into the American political structure, neither of which he deemed possible. Believing that nations should be left unmolested by greater powers, Borah decried American interference in Latin American governments; he and Wilson clashed over policy towards Mexico, then in the throes of revolution. Wilson decided that the Mexican government, led by Victoriano Huerta, must pledge elections in which Huerta would not run before being recognized. Although Borah disliked Huerta as too close to the pre-revolutionary leadership, he felt that Mexicans should decide who ran Mexico, and argued against Wilson&#x27;s plan.

After World War I began in 1914, it was Borah&#x27;s view that the U.S. should keep completely out of it and he voted for legislation requested by Wilson barring armament shipments to the belligerents. Borah was disquieted when Wilson permitted credits to Great Britain and France after refusing them loans, as the credits served the same purpose, furthering the war. He was vigilant in support of the neutral rights of the United States, and was outraged both by the 1915 sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot; by the Germans and by infringements against Americans by British forces. Borah was spoken of as a possible candidate for president in 1916, but gained little support: the Old Guard disliked him almost as much as they did Roosevelt, while others questioned whether a man so free from the discipline of the party could lead its ranks. Borah stated he lacked the money to run. He did work behind the scenes to find a candidate that would reunite the Republicans and holdout Progressives: a member of a joint committee of the two parties&#x27; conventions to seek re-unification, Borah achieved a friendly reception when he addressed the Progressive convention. The Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, and Progressive leaders reluctantly backed him, but some former Roosevelt supporters refused to support Hughes. Borah campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate (something he would do only once more, for Hoover in 1928), but Wilson narrowly won re-election.

==== World War and Versailles treaty (1917â1920) ====
After Germany resumed unlimited submarine warfare in early 1917, many considered U.S. entry into the war inevitable, though Borah expressed hope it might still be avoided. Nevertheless, he supported Wilson on legislation to arm merchant ships, and voted in favor when the president requested a declaration of war in April 1917. He made it clear that in his view, the U.S. was going in to defend its own rights and had no common interest with the Allies beyond the defeat of the Central Powers. He repeated this often through the war: the United States sought no territory, and had no interest in French and British desires for territory and colonies. Borah, though a strong war supporter, was possibly the most prominent wartime advocate of progressive views, opposing the draft and the Espionage Act of 1917, and pressing Wilson for statements of limited war aims. Borah&#x27;s term was to expire in 1919; never a wealthy person and hard-hit by the high cost of living in wartime Washington, he considered leaving the Senate and practicing law in a major New York firm. However, he felt needed in the Senate and in Idaho, as both of the state&#x27;s seats would be up for election in November 1918 due to the death of Borah&#x27;s junior colleague, James H. Brady. Even President Wilson urged Borah&#x27;s re-election in a letter to former senator Dubois. Borah received two-thirds of the vote in his bid for a third term, while former governor Gooding narrowly won Brady&#x27;s seat. Nationally, the Republicans retook control of the Senate with a 49â47 majority.

That the war would not last long beyond the election was clear in the final days of the 1918 congressional midterm election campaign, which was fought in part to decide which party would control the postwar peace process. Wilson hoped for a treaty based on the Fourteen Points and had urged formation of a postwar organization to assure peace. Borah, well aware the U.S. would play a large role at the peace table, saw such an organization as a trap that would inevitably involve the U.S. whenever conflict developed in Europe. He decided to oppose Wilson&#x27;s plan despite his personal admiration for the president. 
Like many Westerners, Borah held agrarian ideals, and linked them with a policy of isolationism and avoiding foreign entanglements he believed had served the nation well. Borah took pains, throughout the battle, to stress that he had opposed the principle of a league before it became a partisan issue; according to McKenna, in Borah&#x27;s League fight, &quot;of partisanship, jealousy, or personal hostility there is no trace&quot;.
Republicans felt Wilson was making a political issue of the peace, especially when the president urged a Democratic Congress prior to the 1918 election, and attended the Paris Peace Conference in person, taking no Republican members of Congress on his delegation. Wilson had felt his statement was the only chance of getting a Senate that might ratify a treaty for a postwar organization to keep the peace, and deemed conciliation pointless. In Paris, Wilson and other leaders negotiated what would become the League of Nations, an international organization that world leaders hoped that through diplomacy, and if necessary, force, would assure peace. Republican senatorial opinion ranged from the Irreconcilables like Borah, who would not support any organization, to those who strongly favored one; none wanted Wilson to go into the 1920 presidential election with credit for having sorted out Europe. Once the general terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which included the Charter of the League of Nations, were presented by Wilson in February 1919, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the incoming Senate Majority Leader, decided on a strategy: rather than outright opposition, Republicans would offer reservations to the treaty that Wilson could not accept.

A week after Wilson presented the treaty, Borah declined an invitation to the White House extended to him and other Senate and House members on the foreign relations committees, alleging there was no chance of common ground, though he wrote to Wilson&#x27;s private secretary that no insult was intended. In the following months, Borah was a leader of the Irreconcilables. An especial target was Article X of the charter, obligating all members to defend each other&#x27;s independence. The Irreconcilables argued that this would commit the U.S. to war without its consent; Borah stated that the U.S. might be forced to send thousands of men if there was conflict in Armenia. Other provisions were examined; Borah proposed that the U.S. representatives in Paris be asked to press the issue of Irish independence, but the Senate took no action. Borah found the provisions of the treaty regarding Germany to be shocking in their vindictiveness, and feared they might snuff out the new Weimar Republic at birth.
The small Republican majority in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge&#x27;s strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him to go along with the plan of delay and reservations as the most likely to succeed, as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson&#x27;s proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed a wary pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As these hearings continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse. In the months that followed, an ailing Wilson refused any compromise.

Borah helped write the majority report for the committee, recommending 45 amendments and 4 reservations. In November 1919, the Senate defeated both versions of the Treaty of Versailles, with and without what were called the Lodge Reservations. Borah, delighted, proclaimed the day the greatest since the end of the Civil War. The following January, the Senate considered the treaty again and Lodge wanted to convene a bipartisan group of senators to find a compromise. Borah, threatening party schism, met with Lodge behind closed doors, and Lodge withdrew his plan. The Senate voted once more, in March 1920, on the treaty with a version of the Lodge Reservations, and it failed again. According to Robert James Maddox in his book on Borah&#x27;s influence on American foreign policy, the Irreconcilables &quot;dictated to the majority leader as though they were the majority. Borah as much as any man deserves the creditâor the blameâfor the League&#x27;s defeat&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage ===
Idaho had given women the right to vote in 1896, and Borah was a firm supporter of woman&#x27;s suffrage. However, he did not support a constitutional amendment to accomplish this nationwide, feeling that states should not have the requirement that women vote imposed on them. Borah voted against the proposed amendment when it came up for a vote in 1914, and it did not pass. Activists felt that as a noted progressive, and as one who would face the voters for the first time as a senator in 1918, that he could be persuaded to support the amendment, and if not, unseated. When what would become the Nineteenth Amendment passed the House, Borah announced his opposition, writing to an Idahoan, &quot;I am awareâ¦[my position] will lead to much criticism among friends at home [but] I would rather give up the office [than] cast a voteâ¦I do not believe in.&quot;

Activists determined to pressure Borah with petitions from his constituents, and former president Roosevelt sent him a note urging him to change his vote. This had no effect, and when the Senate voted on the amendment in early October 1918, it failed by two votes, with Borah voting in the negative. More petitions and pressure on Borah followed, and the senator agreed to meet with suffragist leader Alice Paul. After the meeting, Paul stated that Borah had agreed to support the amendment if re-elected, but the senator said he had agreed to no such thing. Nevertheless, Paul called off the efforts to sway or defeat Borah, and the senator retained his seat by nearly a two-to-one margin.

During the lame duck session of Congress that followed the election, Borah issued no public statement as to how he would vote when the amendment was brought up again. In February 1919, the Senate voted again, and Borah voted noâthe amendment failed by one vote. Several of the new senators who took office in March 1919 were pledged to support the amendment, and on June 4, the Senate voted again, with the House having previously voted to approve the amendment. It passed with a margin of two votes, and was sent to the states for ratification (which was completed in August 1920), but Borah again voted no, one of only eight Republicans to do so.

=== Harding and Coolidge years ===
Borah was determined to see that the Republican presidential candidate in 1920 was not pro-League. He supported his fellow Irreconcilable, California Senator Hiram Johnson, who had been Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in 1912. Borah alleged bribery on the part of the leading candidate for the Republican nomination, General Leonard Wood, and was snubbed when he demanded to know the League views of Wood&#x27;s main rival, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden. When the 1920 Republican National Convention met in Chicago in June, delegates faced a deadlock both as to who should head the ticket, and as to the contents of the League plank of the party platform. The League fight was decided, with Borah&#x27;s endorsement, by using language proposed by former Secretary of State Elihu Root supporting &quot;a&quot; league, rather than &quot;the&quot; League. The presidential stalemate was harder to resolve. A hater both of political intrigue and of tobacco, Borah played no part in the smoke-filled room discussions as the Republicans attempted to break the deadlock. He was initially unenthusiastic about the eventual nominee, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, his colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, as he was disappointed at the failure of Johnson&#x27;s candidacy and disliked Harding&#x27;s vague stance on the League. Nevertheless, Borah strongly endorsed Harding and his running mate, Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, who were victorious. Borah later stated he would have left the Senate had Harding lost.

Borah proved as idiosyncratic as ever in his views with Harding as president. The original idea for the Washington Naval Conference of 1921â22 came from a resolution he introduced in December 1920. After the new Secretary of State, Charles Hughes, took the idea, Borah became an opponent, convinced the conference would lead the United States into the League of Nations through the back door. In 1921, when Harding nominated former president Taft as chief justice, Borah was one of four senators to oppose confirmation. Borah stated that Taft, at 63, was too old and as a politician had been absent for decades from the practice of law. In 1922 and 1923, Borah spoke against passage of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which had passed the House. A strong supporter of state sovereignty, he believed that punishing state officials for failure to prevent lynchings was unconstitutional, and that if the states could not prevent such murders, federal legislation would do no good. The bill was defeated by filibuster in the Senate by Southern Democrats. When another bill (CostiganâWagner Bill) was introduced in 1935 and 1938, Borah continued to speak against it, by that time saying that it was no longer needed, as the number of lynchings had dropped sharply.

Harding&#x27;s death in August 1923 brought Calvin Coolidge to the White House. Borah had been dismayed by Harding&#x27;s conservative views, and believed Coolidge had shown liberal tendencies as a governor. He met with Coolidge multiple times in late 1923, and found the new president interested in his ideas on policies foreign and domestic. Borah was encouraged when Coolidge included in his annual message to Congress a suggestion that he might open talks with the Soviet Union on tradeâthe Bolshevik government had not been recognized since the 1917 October Revolution and Borah had long urged relations. Under pressure from the Old Guard, Coolidge quickly walked back his proposal, depressing Borah, who concluded the president had deceived him. In early 1924, the Teapot Dome scandal broke, and although Coolidge had no involvement in the affair, some of the implicated cabinet officers, including Attorney General Harry Daugherty, remained in office, backed by the Old Guard. Coolidge sought the support of Borah in the crisis; his price was Daugherty&#x27;s firing. The president stalled Borah, and when Daugherty eventually resigned under pressure, it was due more to events than Borah. When the president was nominated for election in his own right at the 1924 Republican National Convention, he offered the vice presidential nomination to Borah. By one account, when Coolidge asked Borah to join the ticket, the senator asked which position on it he was to occupy. The prospect of Borah as vice president appalled Coolidge&#x27;s cabinet members and other Republican officials, and they were relieved when he refused. Borah spent less than a thousand dollars on his Senate re-election campaign that fall, and gained a fourth term with just under 80Â percent of the vote. Coolidge and his vice-presidential choice, Charles G. Dawes easily won, though Borah did no campaigning for the Coolidge/Dawes ticket, alleging his re-election bid required his full attention.

Senator Lodge died in November 1924, making Borah the senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and he took its chairmanship. He could have become Judiciary Committee chairman instead, as the death of Frank Brandegee of Connecticut made Borah senior Republican on that committee as well. The Foreign Relations chairmanship greatly increased his influence, one quip was that the new Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, created policy by ringing Borah&#x27;s doorbell. Borah continued to oppose American interventions in Latin America, often splitting from the Republican majority over the matter. Borah was an avid horseback rider, and Coolidge is supposed to have commented after viewing him exercising in Rock Creek Park that it &quot;must bother the Senator to be going in the same direction as his horse&quot;.

Borah was involved through the 1920s in efforts for the outlawry of war. Chicago lawyer Salmon Levinson, who had formulated the plan to outlaw war, labored long to get the mercurial Borah on board as its spokesman. Maddox suggested that Borah was most enthusiastic about this plan when he needed it as a constructive alternative to defeat actions such as entry into the World Court, that he deemed entangling the U.S. abroad. By the time of the 1924 election, Levinson was frustrated with Borah, but Coolidge&#x27;s statement after the election that outlawry was one of the issues he proposed to address, briefly resurrected Borah&#x27;s enthusiasm. only to have it fall away again. It was not until 1927, when French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand proposed the U.S. and his nation enter into an agreement to &quot;outlaw war&quot; that Borah became interested again, though it took months of pestering by Levinson. In December 1927, Borah introduced a resolution calling for a multilateral version of Briand&#x27;s proposal, and once the KelloggâBriand Pact was negotiated and signed by various nations, secured ratification for that treaty by the Senate.

=== Hoover and FDR ===
Borah hoped to be elected president in 1928, but his only chance was a deadlocked Republican convention. He was reluctant to support Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover for president, backing Ohio Senator Frank Willis instead, but after Willis collapsed and died at a campaign rally in late March, Borah began to find Hoover more to his liking. The Idahoan&#x27;s support for Hoover became more solid as the campaign began to shape as a rural/urban divide. Borah was a strong backer of Prohibition, and the fact that Hoover was another &quot;dry&quot; influenced Borah in his support; the senator disliked the Democratic candidate, New York Governor Al Smith, an opponent of Prohibition, considering him a creature of Tammany Hall. Though Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh commented on &quot;Borah&#x27;s recent conversion to Hoover&quot;, and some progressives were disheartened, Borah undertook a lengthy campaign tour, warning that he saw &quot;the success of Tammany in national politics as nothing less than a national disaster&quot;. Hoover was elected and thanked Borah for &quot;the enormous effect&quot; of his support. He offered to make Borah Secretary of State, though deploring the loss to the Senate, but Borah declined.
Borah was not personally harmed by the stock market crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. Congress in June 1930 passed the HawleyâSmoot Tariff, sharply increasing rates on imports. Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44â42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70Â percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued &quot;that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. Does &quot;anyone&quot; believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. I resent it and I repudiate it.&quot;

When Congress reconvened in December 1931, the Republicans nominally controlled the Senate by the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Charles Curtis, but, as Hoover later wrote, there was no real majority as Borah and other progressives were against the administration. After the Bonus Army marched on Washington, Borah and Hoover agreed that no action should be taken on their demands so long as the ex-soldiers remained in the capital. Borah considered their presence intimidating to Congress, but was angered when they were forcibly dispersed.

Borah considered challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but concluded the president&#x27;s control over the party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 20, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party&#x27;s platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover&#x27;s name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover&#x27;s doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.

The Democratic landslide that accompanied Roosevelt&#x27;s election cost Borah his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee, but much of his influence was independent of party. Borah liked Roosevelt for his liberalism and his energy. Due to illness, Borah took only a limited role in Roosevelt&#x27;s Hundred Days, though he did play a key part in the passage of GlassâSteagall in June 1933, helping forge a compromise that ended the opponents&#x27; filibuster. He opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s calling in of gold, alleging that the government had no power to tell individuals what to do with their money. Borah opposed the National Recovery Act (NRA) and was gratified when it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935. Borah&#x27;s fifteen-year fight for the recognition of the USSR ended in 1933 when Roosevelt opened diplomatic relations.

===1936 presidential campaign and final years ===

Borah ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1936, the first from Idaho to do so. His candidacy was opposed by the conservative Republican leadership. Borah praised Roosevelt for some of his policies, and deeply criticized the Republican Party. With only 25 Republicans left in the Senate, Borah saw an opportunity to recast the Republican Party along progressive lines, as he had long sought to do. He was opposed by the Republican organization, which sought to dilute his strength in the primaries by running state favorite son candidates in order to ensure a brokered convention. Despite being easily the leading primary vote-getter, Borah managed to win only a handful of delegates and took a majority of them in only one state, Wisconsin, where he had the endorsement of Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr. Borah refused to endorse the eventual candidate, Kansas Governor Alf Landon (who was nominated at the 1936 Republican National Convention), leading some to believe Borah might cross party lines and support Roosevelt. Ultimately, as he had four years earlier, he chose to endorse neither candidate. Borah was on the ballot that fall in Idaho, seeking a sixth term in the Senate. For the first time since the people had been given the right to elect senators, the Democrats ran a serious candidate against him, Governor C. Ben Ross. Although Idahoans overwhelmingly voted for Roosevelt, who won every state except Maine and Vermont, Borah still took over sixty percent of their votes in his re-election bid.
Only sixteen Republicans remained in the Senate, most progressives, when Congress met in January 1937, but Borah retained much influence as he was liked and respected by Democrats. Many of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, such as the NRA, were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court during Roosevelt&#x27;s first term, but he had no opportunities to make an appointment to the court in his first four years. In 1937, Roosevelt proposed what came to be known as the court-packing scheme, that for every justice over the age of seventy, an additional one could be appointed. This would give Roosevelt six picks, but would require Congress to pass legislation, which Borah was immediately opposed, believing it would be the death of the Supreme Court as an independent institution. Although he refused to take the lead in the bipartisan opposition, Borah wrote a section of the committee report dealing with the history and independence of the court. When the matter came to the Senate floor, Borah was asked to make the opening speech, but again deferred to the Democratic majority, and Roosevelt&#x27;s plan was defeated. The court crisis had also been defused by the retirement of the Senior Associate Justice, Willis Van Devanter, a Taft appointee. When Borah was asked if he had played a role in Van Devanter&#x27;s retirement, he responded, &quot;Well, guess for yourself. We live in the same apartment house.&quot;

After Hitler took control in Germany in 1933, Borah thought well of the new chancellor&#x27;s repudiation of the war guilt and other clauses of the Versailles treaty, and saw much of value in his new social and economic programs. Despite the Nazi mistreatment of the Jews, Borah did not speak out against Nazi Germany, though many urged him to do so, as he felt that each nation had the right to run its own affairs. Borah opposed large-scale immigration by Jews from Germany, feeling that was &quot;impractical with millions of Americans unemployed&quot;. By 1938, Borah was speaking out against the continued persecutions, but still felt that the European issue could be settled if Germany&#x27;s former colonies were returned. After the Munich Conference in September 1938, Borah issued a statement far more critical of Britain and France for deceiving Czechoslovakia into dismemberment, than of Germany for her aggression.

Borah sought to visit Germany and see Hitler, hoping to settle the troubled international situation. He approached the German Embassy in Washington through intermediaries, and the Germans approved the trip, and even offered to pay, something Borah was unwilling to accept. Borah realized that such a journey would compromise him in foreign policy debates, and did not go; by August 1939, the U.S. was seeking to evacuate its citizens from Europe and the journey was no longer feasible.
in September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, and World War II began, Borah mourned, &quot;Lord, if I could only have talked to Hitlerâall this might have been averted.&quot; This was said to William Kinsey Hutchinson, then International News Service&#x27;s Washington Bureau Chief. Hutchinson indicated that Borah confided this &quot;in words that ran like a prayer&quot;. McKenna noted, &quot;It was fortuitous that the march of events prevented Borah from joining those pacifists and liberalsÂ ... who trudged up the hill to Berchtesgaden to lay before the Fuehrer their plans for world peace&quot;.

== Death ==
Midway through his sixth term on January 19, 1940, Borah died in his sleep of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 74 at his home in Washington, D.C. His state funeral at the U.S. Capitol was held in the Senate chamber on Monday, January 22. A second funeral was held three days later at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, where Borah&#x27;s casket lay beneath the rotunda for six hours prior to the service. An estimated 23,000 passed by the bier or attended the funeral; Boise&#x27;s population in 1940 was just over 26,100. He is buried in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise.

The tributes to Borah on his death were many. William Gibbs McAdoo, a former Democratic senator, stated &quot;You don&#x27;t have to agree with every position taken to concede that he was an intellectual giant and one of the truly great men of our times.&quot; Ernest K. Lindley deemed Borah the &quot;most effectively liberal voice in the Republican Party.&quot; Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels&#x27; paper, &quot;Der Angriff&quot;, asserted, &quot;American life loses a personality valued by friend or foe on account of his courage, honesty, and decent method of fighting.&quot; Borah&#x27;s old classmate, Kansas editor William Allen White, called him &quot;a righteous man who was wise and unafraid, who followed his star, never lowered his flag, and never lost his self-respectÂ ... an honest man who dedicated his talents to his country&#x27;s good.&quot; Columnist Raymond Clapper mourned, &quot;there are no fighters on the progressive side [of the Republican Party]âno men like T.R.Â ... Borah was the last.&quot;

==Marriage and family==
In 1895, Borah married Mary McConnell of Moscow, Idaho, daughter of Governor William J. McConnell. They first met in Moscow while he was campaigning for her father. They had no children and she lived in Washington, D.C., into the 1960s; she died in 1976 at the age of 105. Small and elegant, she was commonly known as &quot;Little Borah&quot;.

Borah had an affair with his close friend Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the eldest child of Theodore Roosevelt. He was the biological father of her daughter, Paulina Longworth Sturm (1925â1957). One family friend said of Paulina, &quot;everybody called her &#x27;Aurora Borah Alice.

== Sites, memorials and cultural effect ==
In 1947, the state of Idaho presented a bronze statue of Borah to the National Statuary Hall Collection, sculpted by Bryant Baker. Idaho&#x27;s highest point, Borah Peak, at was named for him in 1934, while he was dean of the Senate. Two public schools are named for him: Borah High School in Boise, opened in 1958, and Borah Elementary School in Coeur d&#x27;Alene. William E. Borah Apartment, Windsor Lodge, his longtime home in Washington was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976.

Borah was the subject of a 1963 episode, &quot;The Lion of Idaho&quot;, of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. In the episode, Borah as a young attorney (played by Steve Forrest) defends a woman in Nampa on a murder charge.

At the University of Idaho, an annual symposium on international problems and policy is held by the Borah Foundation, which operates under the university&#x27;s auspices. The symposium is intended to honor Borah&#x27;s memory &quot;by considering the causes of war and the conditions necessary for peace in an international context&quot;. The inaugural edition was held in September 1931, and included Borah himself. Also affiliated with the university is the William Edgar Borah Outlawry of War Foundation, which was funded by a donation from Borah&#x27;s colleague in the outlawry movement, Salmon Levinson, in 1929.

== Appraisal and legacy ==
Borah&#x27;s biographer, McKenna, deemed him &quot;an idealist, even a romantic. He fervently defended the idea of an innocent America, an America too much devoted to the principles stated in the Declaration of Independence, Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address, Jefferson&#x27;s First Inaugural, and the Gettysburg Address to risk a compromise of its faith and a coarsening of its character by active entanglement with the Old World.&quot; John Chalmers Vinson, in his volume on Borah&#x27;s involvement with the war outlawry movement, believed that the senator &quot;spoke for a large part of the American public. He was the archetype of absolute insistence on unfettered national will that has been loosely described as isolationism. Further, he represented the struggle to preserve in full the traditions of a small republic remote from strong neighbors against the inroads of recurring crises faced by a world power.&quot; According to LeRoy Ashby in his book on Borah, he &quot;emerged as one of the major figures in American reform politics [and] reached the peak of his prestige and influence during the Twenties&quot;. Maddox noted that &quot;almost as suspicious of U.S. presidents as he was of foreign nations, Borah perceived threats everywhere&quot;.
Borah&#x27;s effectiveness as a reformer was undercut by his tendency to abandon causes after initial enthusiasm, as Maddox put it, &quot;although he was very skilled at speaking out, his unwillingness to do more than protest eventually earned him a reputation for futility.&quot; H. L. Mencken in 1925 deemed Borah &quot;the Great Sham&quot;, and the one most responsible for stopping reform in its tracks. Harold L. Ickes wrote, most likely after the 1928 campaign, that progressives in the Senate, with no illusions left about Borah, called him &quot;our spearless leader&quot;. Theodore Roosevelt described Borah as &quot;entirely insincere&quot;, an insurgent whose chief talent was to &quot;insurge&quot;.

Although Borah&#x27;s career bridged two eras of reform, according to Ashby, &quot;emotionally and intellectually he belonged with the older prewar [that is, pre-World War I] America. As New Deal enthusiast Edgar Kemler observed, he &#x27;was overtaken by obsolescence at an early age&#x27;.&quot; Borah wrote in 1927, near the end of a decade of tumultuous change, &quot;I cannot think of any views which I now have that I did not have before the war.&quot; In 1936, &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been &quot;the great Moral Force of the SenateÂ ... the conscience of the country has been placed in other pockets&quot;.

McKenna saw more than Borah becoming an antique in his own time, she saw damage inflicted by his positions: &quot;time was to demonstrate the utter bankruptcy of the narrow nationalistic policy which the irreconcilables decreed and to which the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover administrations submitted with such disastrous results.&quot; Borah&#x27;s comment regretting that he could not have talked to Hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naivetÃ© in those who believe in the power of pure diplomacy. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

Criticism of Borah meant little to the people of Idaho, who sent him to the Senate six times over thirty years in a rapidly changing America. Claudius O. Johnson, who studied Borah, explained their relationship:


Borah was described by a biographer of his as an &quot;individualist who opposed all concentration of all economic power, political or economic. He was against private privilege and private monopoly, political bureaucracy, and centralized government.&quot;

<text>Henry Sweet (15 September 1845 â 30 April 1912) was an English philologist, phonetician and grammarian.

As a philologist, he specialized in the Germanic languages, particularly Old English and Old Norse. In addition, Sweet published works on larger issues of phonetics and grammar in language and the teaching of languages. Many of his ideas have remained influential, and a number of his works continue to be in print, being used as course texts at colleges and universities.

==Life and work==
Henry Sweet was born in St Pancras, London. He was educated at Bruce Castle School and King&#x27;s College School, London. In 1864, he spent a short time studying at Heidelberg University. Upon his return to England, he took up an office job with a trading company in London. Five years later, aged twenty-four, he won a scholarship in German and entered Balliol College in Oxford.

Sweet neglected his formal academic coursework, concentrating instead on pursuing excellence in his private studies. Early recognition came in his first year at Oxford, when the prestigious Philological Society (of which he was later to become president) published a paper of his on Old English. In 1871, still an undergraduate, he edited King Alfred&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Cura Pastoralis&quot; for the Early English Text Society (&quot;King Alfred&#x27;s West-Saxon Version of Gregory&#x27;s Pastoral Care: With an English Translation, the Latin Text, Notes, and an Introduction&quot;), his commentary establishing the foundation for Old English dialectology. He graduated in 1873, nearly thirty years old, with a fourth-class degree in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;. Subsequent works on Old English included &quot;An Anglo-Saxon Reader&quot; (1876), &quot;The Oldest English Texts&quot; (1885) and &quot;A Student&#x27;s Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon&quot; (1896).

Sweet, like his contemporary Walter Skeat, felt under particular pressure from German scholars in English studies who, often state-employed, tenured, and accompanied by their comitatus of eager graduate students, &quot;annexed&quot; the historical study of English. Dismayed by the &quot;swarms of young program-mongers turned out every year by German universities,&quot; he felt that &quot;no English dilettante can hope to compete with themâexcept by Germanizing himself and losing all his nationality.&quot;

In 1877, Sweet published &quot;A Handbook of Phonetics&quot;, which attracted international attention among scholars and teachers of English in Europe. He followed up with the &quot;Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch&quot; (1885), which was subsequently adapted as &quot;A Primer of Spoken English&quot; (1890). This included the first scientific description of educated London speech, later known as received pronunciation, with specimens of connected speech represented in phonetic script. In addition, he developed a version of shorthand called Current Shorthand, which had both orthographic and phonetic modes. His emphasis on spoken language and phonetics made him a pioneer in language teaching, a subject which he covered in detail in &quot;The Practical Study of Languages&quot; (1899). In 1901, Sweet was made reader in phonetics at Oxford. &quot;The Sounds of English&quot; (1908) was his last book on English pronunciation.

Other books by Sweet include &quot;An Icelandic Primer with Grammar, Notes and Glossary&quot; (1886), &quot;The History of Language&quot; (1900), and a number of other works he edited for the Early English Text Society. Sweet was also closely involved in the early history of the Oxford English Dictionary.

Despite the recognition he received for his scholarly work, Sweet never received a university professorship, a fact that disturbed him greatly, although he was appointed reader. He had done poorly as a student at Oxford, he had annoyed many people through bluntness, and he failed to make every effort to gather official support. His relationship with the Oxford University Press was often strained.

Sweet died on 30 April 1912 in Oxford, of pernicious anemia; he left no children.

==Other interests==
In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who, 1911&quot;, Sweet gave his recreations as: 

==Legacy==
Sweet has retained a reputation as &quot;the man who taught Europe phonetics&quot;. His work established an applied linguistics tradition in language teaching which has continued without interruption to the present day.

A bibliography and &quot;Collected Papers&quot; were published by H. C. Wyld.

In the preface to his 1913 play &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, George Bernard Shaw stated that &quot;[Henry] Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play.&quot; Leslie Howard portrayed the character of Higgins in the 1938 film &quot;Pygmalion&quot;; Henry Higgins was notably portrayed by Rex Harrison in the 1956 stage musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and its 1964 screen adaptation.

The Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas (founded 1984) is named after him. It holds annual colloquia, and publishes the journal &quot;Language and History&quot;.

<text>Maurice de Vlaminck (; 4 April 1876 - 11 October 1958) was a French painter. Along with AndrÃ© Derain and Henri Matisse, he is considered one of the principal figures in the Fauve movement, a group of modern artists who from 1904 to 1908 were united in their use of intense colour. Vlaminck was one of the Fauves at the controversial Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition of 1905.

==Life==

Maurice de Vlaminck was born on Rue Pierre Lescot in Paris. His father Edmond Julien was Flemish and taught violin and his mother JosÃ©phine Caroline Grillet came from Lorraine and taught piano. His father taught him to play the violin. He began painting in his late teens. In 1893, he studied with a painter named Henri Rigalon on the Ãle de Chatou. In 1894 he married Suzanne Berly. The turning point in his life was a chance meeting on the train to Paris towards the end of his stint in the army. Vlaminck, then 23 and already active in anarchist circles in Paris, met an aspiring artist, AndrÃ© Derain, with whom he struck up a lifelong friendship. When Vlaminck completed his army service in 1900, the two rented a studio together, the Maison Levanneur, which now houses the Cneai, for a year before Derain left to do his own military service. In 1902 and 1903 he wrote several mildly pornographic novels illustrated by Derain. He painted during the day and earned his livelihood by giving violin lessons and performing with musical bands at night.

Vlaminck participated in the controversial 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition. After viewing the boldly colored canvases of Vlaminck, Henri Matisse, AndrÃ© Derain, Albert Marquet, Kees van Dongen, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy, the art critic Louis Vauxcelles disparaged the painters as &quot;fauves&quot; (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, Fauvism.

In 1911, Vlaminck traveled to London and painted by the Thames. In 1913, he painted again with Derain in Marseille and Martigues. In World War I he was stationed in Paris, and began writing poetry. Eventually he settled in Rueil-la-GadeliÃ¨re, a small village south-west of Paris. He married his second wife, Berthe Combes, with whom he had two daughters. From 1925 he traveled throughout France, but continued to paint primarily along the Seine, near Paris. Resentful that Fauvism had been overtaken by Cubism as an art movement Vlaminck blamed Picasso &quot;for dragging French painting into a wretched dead end and state of confusion&quot;. During the Second World War, Vlaminck visited Germany and on his return published a tirade against Picasso and Cubism in the periodical &quot;Comoedia&quot; in June 1942. Vlaminck wrote many autobiographies.

Vlaminck died in Rueil-la-GadeliÃ¨re on 11 October 1958.

==Artistic career==

Two of Vlaminck&#x27;s groundbreaking paintings, &quot;Sur le zinc&quot; (At the Bar) and &quot;L&#x27;homme a la pipe&quot; (Man Smoking a Pipe) were painted in 1900.

For the next few years Vlaminck lived in or near Chatou (the inspiration for his painting &quot;houses at Chatou&quot;), painting and exhibiting alongside Derain, Matisse, and other Fauvist painters. At this time his exuberant paint application and vibrant use of colour displayed the influence of Vincent van Gogh. &quot;Sur le zinc&quot; called to mind the work of Toulouse-Lautrec and his portrayals of prostitutes and solitary drinkers, but does not attempt to probe the sitter&#x27;s psychologyâa break with the century-old European tradition of individualized portraiture. According to art critic Souren Melikian, it is &quot;the impersonal cartoon of a type.&quot; In his landscape paintings, his approach was similar. He ignored the details, with the landscape becoming a vehicle through which he could express mood through violent colour and brushwork. An example is &quot;Sous bois&quot;, painted in 1904. The following year, he began to experiment with &quot;deconstruction,&quot; turning the physical world into dabs and streaks of colour that convey a sense of motion. His paintings &quot;Le Pont de Chatou&quot; (The Chatou Bridge), &quot;Les Ramasseurs de pommes de terre&quot; (The Potato Pickers), &quot;La Seine a Chatou&quot; (The River Seine at Chatou) and &quot;Le Verger&quot; (The Orchard) exemplify this trend.

==Artistic influences==
Vlaminck&#x27;s compositions show familiarity with the Impressionists, several of whom had painted in the same area in the 1870s and 1880s. After visiting a Van Gogh exhibit, he declared that he &quot;loved Van Gogh that day more than my own father&quot;. From 1908 his palette grew maybe more deep and rich in color, and the predominant influence was that of CÃ©zanne. His later work displayed a darker palette, punctuated by heavy strokes of impasto contrasting with subtle blending and vibrant color temperature relations.

Some of his works are held at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

<doc id="703127" wikidata="Q2732505" url="?curid=703127" title="Death (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Death is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Mike Friedrich and Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; #26 (June 1973). Death is based on the personification of death. She is a nigh-omnipotent cosmic entity and a fundamental constant of mortal existence, depicted as the &quot;twin&quot; of Oblivion, and &quot;sister&quot; and antithetical force to Eternity.

Death typically appears as a skeletal figure cloaked in a black hood, occasionally taking the form of a woman with black hair, who pursues close (sometimes-romantic/sexual) relationships with Deadpool, Thanos, and Ben Reilly. The character is known under the codename of Mistress Death. She has also colloquially been referred to as Lady Death.

Since her original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. The character made her live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) miniseries &quot;Agatha All Along&quot; (2024), portrayed by Aubrey Plaza; this iteration of the character is depicted as being in love with Agatha Harkness.

==Fictional character biography==

Death is an abstract entity, embodiment of life ending in the Marvel Universe, and the opposite of Eternity, embodiment of the universe. Death is predominantly depicted as a skeleton cloaked in a black or purple robe, and at times appears as a Caucasian human female.

A storyline in the title &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; showcases Thanos&#x27; scheme to conquer the universe, as the character becomes determined to prove his love for Death by destroying all life. Although Thanos obtains the artifact the Cosmic Cube and succeeds in taking control of the universe, Death abandons the character when he is defeated by the combined might of Captain Marvel, Drax the Destroyer and the Avengers. Two Marvel Annuals feature Thanos as he tries to &quot;woo&quot; Death back (courtesy of the Infinity Gems with which he plans to extinguish every star in the galaxy), but is killed in a final battle with the Avengers, Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell), and Adam Warlock. When Mar-Vell is stricken with terminal cancer, Thanos returns to the character in a vision and introduces him to the entity Death. Mar-Vell willingly surrenders his life and embraces the entity.

In Marvel&#x27;s first limited series &quot;Contest of Champions&quot;, Death agrees to a game of strategy with the Elder of the Universe the Grandmaster. The Grandmaster wins the game and Death provides him with the power (via the Golden Globe of Life) to resurrect the Collector, a fellow Elder. Only then does Death reveal that the Golden Globe is an empty instrument that needs to be powered by a life-force equal to that of the being who is to be restored. To resurrect the Collector, the Grandmaster sacrifices his life and takes the Collector&#x27;s place in the Realm of the Dead. In the limited series &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; the entity Beyonder takes human form and visits Earth. It decides to &quot;save&quot; mankind, and in doing so destroys Death. The Beyonder is then shown there is a need for Death and transforms his friend, a human reporter named Dave, into Death&#x27;s new personification.

In an &quot;Avengers&quot; Annual, the Grandmaster reveals his sacrifice was a ruse as he&#x27;s able to steal Death&#x27;s powers and via another deception tricks the entity into banishing all Elders from the Realm of the Dead, effectively rendering them immortal. The threads of this storyline continue in the title &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; where a group of 11 Elders conspires to use the Infinity Gems to kill the cosmic entity Galactus and thereby destroy reality itself. After their plan is thwarted, Galactus devours 5 Elders, assuming that his status as a being who transcends Death and Eternity means that he does not have to abide by Death&#x27;s vow. However, Galactus finds the Elders difficult to absorb and Death is displeased that Galactus has chosen to ignore her vow. Subsequently, when three Elders â the Astronomer; Possessor, and Trader â threaten to use the Infinity Gems to prevent the In-Betweener from hurling Galactus (with their brother Elders still inside him) into a black hole, the conceptual being responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate the 3 Elders against her will, a transgression that Death finds heinous.

The limited series &quot;The Thanos Quest,&quot; reveals that Death perceives an imbalance in the universe and a gradual shift towards life rather than death; the entity resurrects Thanos. Thanos successfully collects the Infinity Gems, and attempts to converse with Death on its own level. The irony is the character is now superior to Death, and as such Death may not speak with him (a fact relayed via one of Death&#x27;s minions). The story continues in a consecutive limited series &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, in which Thanos then wipes half the beings in the universe from existence as proof of his love for Death; the entity remains and watches as he battles Earth&#x27;s metahumans, but after they are defeated, Death joins the cosmic pantheon in trying to defeat Thanos. Though the cosmic entities are unsuccessful, Thanos eventually loses the Infinity Gems and is defeated.

The mercenary Deadpool is depicted having a humorous exchange with the entity in a &quot;Deadpool Annual&quot;. He becomes infatuated with Death after having a number of near-death experiences. During the &quot;Funeral for a Freak&quot; storyline, Death appears to reciprocate the feeling, and a jealous Thanos prevents Deadpool from dying and joining the entity by cursing him with immortality. In the second volume of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, Death reunites with Thanos to confront the Death God Walker, who tries unsuccessfully to court Death. Death hides within the body of Marlo Chandler (girlfriend of Rick Jones) in an attempt to escape Walker. The entity eventually destroys Walker and then leaves the body of Marlo, although Marlo retains a connection to Death which (in extreme circumstances) allows her to access the cosmic powers of Death.

The limited series &quot;&quot; continues to explore the relationship between Death and Thanos. As the entity reveals to Thanos that their energies merged when he was resurrected, creating an offspring called the Rot. Death and Thanos work together to destroy their offspring, and it is at this time that Death finally addresses Thanos and admits to feeling &quot;love&quot; for him. The pair also share a kiss in the limited series &quot;&quot;, moments before Thanos, possessing the artifact the Heart of the Universe, recreates the universe minus a critical flaw that would have destroyed it.

During the limited series &quot;Annihilation&quot;, Thanos joins the fight to stop the Annihilation Wave, and during the war is killed by his old foe Drax the Destroyer. When the hero Nova is near death from injuries sustained in battle, he glimpses Death and Thanos standing together watching him. The second volume of the &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; features a new development: Phyla-Vell, the heroine Quasar, agrees to become the new avatar of Oblivion (an aspect of Death) in exchange for the freedom of lover Heather Douglas.

In &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;, the Captain Marvel of the Cancerverse, called Lord Mar-Vell, using a ritual to the Many-angled ones that involves sacrificing the Avatar of Death, is able to destroy Death&#x27;s M-body and remove her from his universe. In the last issue of this 6-part mini-series, it is revealed that Thanos, upon coming back to life, has been completely removed from the realm of death and can no longer die. In a twist he appears to accept Lord Mar-Vell&#x27;s proposal to be a sacrifice so the Many-angled ones can invade the 616 universe; however, this proves a trap set by Death herself in order to get close to Mar-Vell. By destroying him, she kills every living thing in the Cancerverse, initiates its and the Fault&#x27;s collapse, and even injures the Many-angled ones to such a degree that it will take them eons to heal.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Daimon Hellstrom mentions to Hercules that Death has fled their reality upon Amatsu-Mikaboshi triumphing in the realms of the dead, causing the souls of the deceased to be unleashed upon the Earth, and rendering the victims of the siege, whose injuries might otherwise prove fatal, locked in a deathless limbo.

Following the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Death has appeared in Las Vegas under the guise of Marlo Chandler to talk with Ben Reilly â the clone of Spider-Man, recently brought back to life and spending some time acting as the new Jackal â initially instructing him to go after a duo of teen punks randomly shooting civilians around the city, claiming that she is testing what he will do about this discovery. Ben manages to find the criminals, shooting one of them twice with his own gun but avoiding causing fatal injuries, but when he is attacked by his &quot;brother&quot; and fellow clone Kaine after the death of a girl Reilly had been trying to treat for a serious illness, Marlo appears and kills Kaine with a single touch. &quot;Marlo&quot; subsequently identifies herself as Death and explains that she has developed an &quot;interest&quot; in Reilly (greater than that she has in Deadpool or Thanos) as no other person has been brought back to life so often. She reveals that he has &quot;died&quot; so many times that his soul has become corrupted and if he undergoes one more resurrection, he will likely suffer so much spiritual damage that his soul will be broken for good. She offers Reilly the chance to restore Cassandra Mercury&#x27;s daughter Abigail or Kaine to life before she departs. When Reilly asks her to save both of them and kill him instead, Death not only heals the other two, but also restores Reilly to a healthy physical appearance. Death also affirms that he has made a start on his efforts to redeem himself of his sins as the Jackal and to become a hero again. However, after Ben Reilly brutally beats a civilian who was responsible for the theft of food donations to a charity drive, Death reveals that the healing of his scars only remains so long as Reilly does not compromise his status as a hero, with the aforementioned beating leading to him regaining scars around his right eye.

==Powers and abilities==
Death is an immortal and powerful cosmic entity embodying the concept of mortality and lacking a true physical form. The abstract being holds near-infinite knowledge and power, allowing for manipulation of time and reality. With absolute control over death, the entity can kill or resurrect any individual. To interact with lesser beings, Death sometimes adopts the appearance of a humanoid female. The character resides in a pocket dimension called the Realm of Death.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Kayleigh Donaldson of &quot;Syfy&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s no wonder that modern pop culture has enjoyed fleshing out its grim heroes beyond their skeletal foundations. [..] In Marvel Comics, Lady Death&#x27;s power is so alluring, and the woman herself so hypnotically sexy, that Thanos tries to destroy half of all living beings in the universe just to impress her.&quot; Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Death a &quot;role model&quot; and &quot;truly heroic.&quot; Nat Brehmer of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; asserted, &quot;Many fans were expecting, or at least hoping, to see Death in &quot;Infinity War&quot; because of her ties to Thanos.&quot; Via Erhard of &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked Death 2nd in their &quot;7 Most Iconic Marvel Gods &amp; Goddesses&quot; list.

Marco Vito Oddo of &quot;Collider&quot; referred to Death as a &quot;fan-favorite cosmic entity,&quot; and ranked her 4th in their &quot;19 Most Powerful Marvel Characters&quot; list. Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Death 12th in their &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy 3: 50 Marvel Characters We Want to See&quot; list, saying, &quot;Where there is Thanos, there is Death. Thanos&#x27; beloved, the hooded embodiment of the end, should make an appearance before the Thanos saga is over. Something about that cloaked figure and her skull visage standing next to Thanos is so iconic. Death&#x27;s inclusion would make audiences understand (and fear) Thanos as he tries to burn a galaxy to win her love.&quot;

Johnny Brayson and Nola Pfau of &quot;Bustle&quot; ranked Death 8th in their &quot;37 Most Powerful Characters In The Marvel Universe&quot; list. Chris Hinton of &quot;Looper&quot; ranked Death 7th in their &quot;Strongest Supervillains In History&quot; list. Mark Langshaw of &quot;WhatCulture&quot; ranked Death 9th in their &quot;10 New MCU Characters To Look Out For In 2018 &quot; list.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Death in their &quot;Eternity And 9 Other Crucial Cosmic Entities In Marvel Comics&quot; list, in their &quot;15 Villains Too Powerful For The MCU (And 15 Current Villains Who Are Way Too Weak)&quot; list, and ranked her 19th in their &quot;Marvel Vs DC: The 25 Most Powerful Gods&quot; list. &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Death 1st in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Female Gods&quot; list, 1st in their &quot;Marvel: The 10 Strongest Female Villains&quot; list, 1st in their &quot;10 Most Evil Supervillain Couples In Marvel&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;19 Most Powerful Cosmic Marvel Characters&quot; list, 8th in their &quot;10 Smartest Gods In Marvel Comics&quot; list, and 10th in their &quot;10 Bravest Gods In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

<text>The Alcyonides (, &quot;Alkyonides&quot;) were, in Greek mythology, the seven daughters of the giant Alcyoneus.

== Names ==
These sisters were identified individually as, Alkippe, Anthe, Asteria, Drimo, Methone, Pallene and Phthonia (Phosthonia or Chthonia).

== Mythology ==
When their father Alcyoneus was slain by Heracles, the Alcyonides threw themselves into the sea from Kanastraion, which is the peak of Pellene. They were transformed into halcyons (kingfishers) by Amphitrite.

== Legacy ==

===Islands===
The Alkyonides are also small rocky islands in the Corinthian Gulf very close to the coast of Attica, Peloponnese and Central Greece, taking their name from the mythological figures. They reported a 2001 census population of nine inhabitants and are administratively part of the municipality of Loutraki-Perachora in Corinthia.

===Climate===
The term &quot;Alkyonides&quot; also refers to a meteorological phenomenon of the central Greek climate. Nearly every year in the period after Christmas until the middle of January there is a non-interrupted period of days with clear blue skies and warm temperatures, which at least in the Athens region can reach more than 20Â Â°C over the day.

===Astronomy===

The Saturnian moons Methone, Anthe and Pallene are named after three of the Alkyonides.

<text>The science of webometrics (also cybermetrics) tries to measure the World Wide Web to get knowledge about the number and types of hyperlinks, structure of the World Wide Web and using patterns. According to BjÃ¶rneborn and Ingwersen, the definition of webometrics is &quot;the study of the quantitative aspects of the construction and use of information resources, structures and technologies on the Web drawing on bibliometric and informetric approaches.&quot; The term &quot;webometrics&quot; was first coined by Almind and Ingwersen (1997). A second definition of webometrics has also been introduced, &quot;the study of web-based content with primarily quantitative methods for social science research goals using techniques that are not specific to one field of study&quot;, which emphasizes the development of applied methods for use in the wider social sciences. The purpose of this alternative definition was to help publicize appropriate methods outside the information-science discipline rather than to replace the original definition within information science.

Similar scientific fields are: bibliometrics, informetrics, scientometrics, virtual ethnography, and web mining.
One relatively straightforward measure is the &quot;web impact factor&quot; (WIF) introduced by Ingwersen (1998). The WIF measure may be defined as the number of web pages in a web site receiving links from other web sites, divided by the number of web pages published in the site that are accessible to the crawler. However, the use of WIF has been disregarded due to the mathematical artifacts derived from power law distributions of these variables. Other similar indicators using size of the institution instead of number of webpages have been proved more useful.

<text>Jabal al-Druze (), is an elevated volcanic region in the As-Suwayda Governorate of southern Syria. Most of the inhabitants of this region are Druze, and there are also significant Christian communities. Safaitic inscriptions were first found in this area. The State of Jabal Druze was an autonomous area in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon from 1921 to 1936. In the past, the name Jabal al-Druze was used for a different area, located in Mount Lebanon.

In Syria, most Druze reside in the As-Suwayda Governorate, which encompasses almost all of Jabal al-Druze. This governorate is unique in Syria as it has a Druze majority. Additionally, it has integrated Christian communities that have long coexisted harmoniously with the Druze in these mountains. 

In the 1980s Druze made up 87.6% of the population, Christians (mostly Greek Orthodox) 11% and Sunni Muslims 2%. In 2010, the As-Suwayda governorate has a population of about 375,000 inhabitants, Druze made up 90%, Christians 7% and Sunni Muslims 3%. Due to low birth and high emigration rates, Christians proportion in As-Suwayda had declined.

==Geology==
The Jabal al-Druze volcanic field, the southernmost in Syria, lies in the Haurun-Druze Plateau in SW Syria near the border with Jordan. The most prominent feature of this volcanic field is 1800m-high Jabal al-Druze (also known variously as Jabal ad Duruz, Djebel Al-Arab, Jabal Druze, Djebel ed Drouz). The alkaline volcanic field consists of a group of 118 basaltic volcanoes active from the lower-Pleistocene to the Holocene (2.6 million years ago to present). The large SW Plateau depression is filled by basaltic lava flows from volcanoes aligned in a NW-SE direction. This volcanic field lies within the northern part of the massive alkaline Harrat al-Sham (also known as Harrat al-Shaam) volcanic field that extends from southern Syria to Saudi Arabia.

<doc id="703152" wikidata="Q1050213" url="?curid=703152" title="Washington Naval Conference">
<text>The Washington Naval Conference (or the Washington Conference on the Limitation of Armament) was a disarmament conference called by the United States and held in Washington, D.C., from November 12, 1921, to February 6, 1922.
It was conducted outside the auspices of the League of Nations. It was attended by nine nations (the United States, Japan, China, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal)
regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia.
Germany was not invited to the conference, as restrictions on its navy had already been set in the Versailles Treaty. Soviet Russia was also not invited to the conference. It was the first arms control conference in history, and is still studied by political scientists as a model for a successful disarmament movement. 

Held at Memorial Continental Hall, in Downtown Washington,
it resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the Washington Naval Treaty), the Nine-Power Treaty, and a number of smaller agreements. These treaties preserved the peace during the 1920s but were not renewed in the increasingly hostile world of the Great Depression.

==Background==

At the end of World War I, the British still had the largest navy afloat, but its big ships were becoming obsolete, and the Americans and the Japanese were rapidly building expensive new warships. Britain and Japan were allies in a treaty that was due to expire in 1922. Although there were no immediate dangers, observers increasingly pointed to the American-Japanese rivalry for control of the Pacific Ocean as a long-term threat to world peace. By then, considering their colonial interests in Asia, the British decided that it was better for them to cast their lot with Washington than Tokyo. To stop a needless, expensive, and possibly dangerous arms race, the major countries signed a series of naval disarmament agreements.

The global appetite for peace and disarmament was aplenty throughout the 1920s. Women had just won the right to vote in many countries, and they helped convince politicians that money could be saved, votes won, and future wars avoided by stopping the arms race. Across the world, leaders of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement formed international organizations such as the International Council of Women and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. Historian Martin Pugh writes that they achieved the greatest influence in the 1920s, &quot;when they helped to promote women&#x27;s contribution to the anti-war movement throughout the Western world.&quot; In the United States, practically all the major Protestant denominations and highly-visible Protestant spokesmen were strong supporters of international peace efforts. They collaborated to work to educate their local congregations on the need for peace and disarmament.

==Meeting==
The American delegation, led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, included Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge and Oscar Underwood, the last being the Democratic minority leader in the Senate. The conference&#x27;s primary objective was to restrain Japanese naval expansion in the waters of the West Pacific, especially with regard to fortifications on strategically-valuable islands. Its secondary objectives were intended to obtain an ultimate limit to Japanese expansion and also an alleviation of concerns over possible antagonism with the British. They were to eliminate Anglo-American tension by abrogating the Anglo-Japanese alliance, to agree upon a favorable naval ratio vis-Ã -vis Japan, and to have the Japanese officially accept a continuation of the Open Door Policy in China.

The British, however, took a more cautious and tempered approach. Indeed, the British officials brought certain general desires to the conference: to achieve peace and stability in the West Pacific; avoid a naval arms race with the United States; thwart Japanese encroachment into areas under their influence; and preserve the security of Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dominion countries, but they did not enter the conference with a specific laundry list of demands. Rather, they brought with them a vague vision of what the West Pacific should look like after an agreement. 

Japanese officials were more focused on specifics than the British, and they approached the conference with two primary goals: to sign a naval treaty with Britain and the United States and to obtain official recognition of Japan&#x27;s special interests in Manchuria and Mongolia. Japanese officials also brought other issues to the conference: a strong demand to remain in control of Yap, Siberia, and Tsingtao as well as more general concerns about the growing presence of American fleets in the Pacific.

The American hand was strengthened by the interception and decryption of secret instructions from the Japanese government to its delegation. The message revealed the lowest naval ratio that would be acceptable to Tokyo; US negotiators used that knowledge to push the Japanese. This success, one of the first in the US government&#x27;s budding eavesdropping and cryptology efforts, led eventually to the growth of such agencies.

The head of the Japanese delegation to the Washington Naval Conference was Prince Iyesato Tokugawa, who during the first four decades of the twentieth century led a political movement in Japan that promoted democracy and international goodwill with the U.S., Europe and Asia. His influence was significant in the negotiations and ratification of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Agreements==
US President Warren Harding called the Washington Conference a deal that all countries thought best for themselves. To resolve technical disputes about the quality of warships, the conferees adopted a standard based on the tonnage displacement, a simple measure of the size of a ship. A ten-year agreement fixed the ratio of battleships at 5:5:3: 525,000 tons for the US, 525,000 tons for Britain, and 315,000 tons for Japan. Smaller limits with a ratio of 1.67 applied to France and Italy. Battleships, the dominant weapons systems of the era, could be no larger than 35,000 tons. The major powers allowed themselves 135,000:135,000:81,000 tons for the newly-developed aircraft carriers.

While the admirals were unhappy, peace activists strongly supported the results and successfully worked for ratification. In the United States they included the World Peace Foundation; the American Association for International Conciliation; the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; the Women&#x27;s Peace Society; the Women&#x27;s World Disarmament Committee; the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. 

The Washington Conference exactly captured the worldwide popular demand for peace and disarmament. Without an agreement, the US, Britain and Japan likely would have engaged in a naval arms race much like that experienced between Britain and Germany before the First World War. However, even with the restrictions, the agreement solidified Japan&#x27;s position as a great power and was treated as a colonial power with equal diplomatic interests, a first for a non-Western nation. 

The naval treaty was concluded on February 6, 1922. Ratifications of the treaty were exchanged in Washington on August 17, 1923, and it was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on April 16, 1924.

Japan agreed to revert Shandong to Chinese control by an agreement concluded on February 4, 1922. Ratifications of the agreement were exchanged in Beijing on June 2, 1922, and it was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on July 7, 1922.

==Results==
The Washington Naval Treaty led to an effective end to building new battleship fleets, and the few ships that were built were limited in size and armament. Many existing capital ships were scrapped or sunk. Some ships under construction were turned into aircraft carriers instead.

Even with the treaty, the major navies remained suspicious of one another and briefly (1927â1930) engaged in a race to build heavy cruisers, which had been limited in size (10,000 tons) but not numbers. That oversight was resolved on value of cruisers by the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which specified a 10:10:7 ratio for cruisers and destroyers. For the first time, submarines were also limited, with Japan given parity with the US and Britain, at 53,000 tons each. (Submarines typically displaced 1,000â2,000 tons each.) The US Navy maintained an active building program that replaced obsolescent warships with technically more sophisticated new models in part because its construction yards were important sources of political patronage and so were well protected by Congress. During the New Deal, relief funds were used to build more warships. &quot;The naval program was wholly mine,&quot; President Franklin Roosevelt boasted.

==Termination==
The pacts and the treaties that resulted from the Washington Naval Treaty remained in effect for fourteen years. Japan ended participation in 1936.

<text>Johnnie To Kei-fung (born 22 April 1955) is a Hong Kong filmmaker. Popular in his native Hong Kong, To has also found acclaim overseas. Intensely prolific, To has made films in a variety of genres, though in the West he is best known for his action and crime movies, which have earned him critical respect and a cult following, which includes American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.

To&#x27;s biggest international successes include &quot;Breaking News&quot;, &quot;Election&quot;, &quot;Election 2&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Triad Election&quot;), &quot;Exiled&quot;, &quot;Mad Detective&quot; and &quot;Drug War&quot;; these films have appeared in a number of international film festivals, been distributed theatrically in France and the United States, and been widely sold to foreign countries.

His films, often made in collaboration with the same group of actors, screenwriters and cinematographers, frequently explore themes of friendship, fate and the changing face of Hong Kong society. Sometimes described as &quot;multifaceted and chameleonic&quot; due to his ability to switch tones and genres between movies, To is nonetheless seen as having a consistent style, which involves mixing subdued realism and social observation with highly stylised visual and acting elements. To has cited King Hu as the director who has influenced his work the most.

To heads the Hong Kongâbased production company Milkyway Image with his frequent co-director Wai Ka-fai.

==Career==
To began his career at age 17 as a messenger for the Hong Kong television studio TVB. From there To moved up the ladder, working as an executive producer and director for TV shows starting in 1973. In 1978, he shot his first theatrical feature, but continued working in television. In 1983, he directed and screen-wrote the critically acclaimed The Legend of the Condor Heroes, a dramatised TV series base on the martial art novel of the same name by Jin Yong.

While working as an assistant TV director during the Shaw Studios era he directed &quot;All About Ah-Long&quot; (1989), starring Chow Yun-fat. The film became one of the biggest box office hits that year. In 1988, he co-directed &quot;The Big Heat&quot;, his first action movie. The film was produced by Tsui Hark. The end of the 1980s also saw some of To&#x27;s biggest commercial successes, the vast majority of which were comedies. His 1988 film &quot;The Eighth Happiness&quot; was that year&#x27;s highest-grossing movie.

In 1996, To and frequent collaborator Wai Ka-fai formed Milkyway Image, a production house specialising in cost-efficient independent films made by To and Wai, as well as their frequent collaborators from Law Wing-cheung to scriptwriter Yau Nai-hoi.

From 1999 to 2001, To was the chief operational officer of China Star Entertainment Group. To was appointed to the Hong Kong Arts Development Council in 2004 and soon after chaired its Film and Media Arts Group.

In May 2011, To served as a jury member at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.

His film &quot;Life Without Principle&quot; (2011) was selected as the Hong Kong&#x27;s entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 85th Academy Awards, but did not make the shortlist.

In 2016, To served as the Jury President for the 10th Asian Film Awards.

In June 2017, To was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

In June 2019, To was announced as the Jury President for the 56th Golden Horse Awards, but resigned his position in September.

In February 2023, To served as a jury member at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival.

==Festivals and awards==
Commercially successful in his native Hong Kong, To&#x27;s films have regularly appeared at international festivals, most notably in Europe and North America. Six of To&#x27;s films have been featured at the Cannes Film Festival: &quot;Breaking News&quot; premiered as an Out-of-Competition midnight screening in 2004; &quot;Election&quot; was shown in Competition in 2005; its sequel, &quot;Election 2&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Triad Election&quot;) was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2006, and &quot;Triangle&quot; was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2007; &quot;Vengeance&quot; competed for the prestigious Palme d&#x27;Or in 2009; &quot;Blind Detective&quot; was screened in Out-of-Competition midnight screenings in 2013.

At the Berlin International Film Festival, &quot;Sparrow&quot; was shown in Competition in 2008.

At the Venice International Film Festival, &quot;Throw Down&quot; was screened Out-of-Competition in 2004; &quot;Exiled&quot; was shown in Competition at the festival in 2006; &quot;Mad Detective&quot; was shown in Competition in 2007; &quot;Life Without Principle&quot; was shown in Competition in 2011.

In North America, To&#x27;s films have been consistently screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;Fulltime Killer&quot;, &quot;PTU&quot;, &quot;Breaking News&quot;, &quot;Throw Down&quot; and &quot;Mad Detective&quot; all screened between 1999 and 2007. In 2006, &quot;Election&quot;, &quot;Election 2&quot;, and &quot;Exiled&quot; were screened.

In 2005, To received the &quot;Time Machine Career Achievement Award&quot; at the Festival de Cine de Sitges, Europe&#x27;s most prestigious film festival specializing in genre films. To was also honoured as a &quot;Filmmaker in Focus&quot; of the 2007 International Film Festival Rotterdam. In 2009, while &quot;Vengeance&quot; competed at Cannes, To was made an officer of the French Order of Arts and Letters by the French Minister of Culture in recognition of his films.

The annual Hong Kong International Film Festival held its 45th edition in April 2021 and To directed a segment of the 2020 anthology film &quot;&quot;. The other filmmakers who directed segments in the anthology are Sammo Hung, Ann Hui, Patrick Tam, Tsui Hark, Yuen Woo-ping and Ringo Lam. The short films were shot entirely on 35mm film, each of them touching on a nostalgic and moving story set across different time periods, with every one being an ode to the city.

In 2024, To was appointed Jury member at the 2024 Tokyo International Film Festival for its section &#x27;International competition&#x27;.

<text>The Masters is a professional invitational snooker tournament. Held every year since 1975, it is the second-longest-running professional snooker tournament after the World Championship. It is one of the three Triple Crown events, along with the UK Championship and the World Championship. Although not a ranking event, it is regarded as one of the most prestigious tournaments on the World Snooker Tour. The reigning champion is Shaun Murphy, who won his second masters title in 2025, defeating Kyren Wilson 10-7. 

The Masters began in 1975 as an invitational event for 10 top players. The inaugural champion was John Spencer. Since 1984, the standard invitees have been the top 16 players in the world rankings, with the addition of two or three wild-card places in tournaments held between 1990 and 2010.

Twelve players have won the tournament more than once. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan has won a record eight titles. Stephen Hendry has won six titles, including a record five consecutive wins from 1989 to 1993. Steve Davis, Paul Hunter, Mark Selby, and Cliff Thorburn have won three titles each, and Alex Higgins, John Higgins, Shaun Murphy, Neil Robertson, Judd Trump and Mark Williams have won two each. O&#x27;Sullivan holds records as both the tournament&#x27;s youngest and oldest winner, having won his first title in 1995, aged 19 years and 69 days, and his eighth title in 2024, aged 48 years and 40 days. John Higgins has made the most Masters appearances, with 31 as of 2025. In 2016, the Masters trophy was renamed the Paul Hunter Trophy in honour of the former champion, who won the title three times in four years from 2001 to 2004, before he died in 2006 aged 27. 

Six maximum breaks have been made in the history of the tournament. Kirk Stevens made the first in 1984, Ding Junhui made the second in 2007, and Marco Fu made the third in 2015. Ding and Mark Allen made the fourth and fifth maximums respectively at the 2024 event. Shaun Murphy made the sixth maximum at the 2025 event.

== History ==

=== 1975â1983 ===
The tournament was held for the first time in 1975 at the West Centre Hotel in London, when ten leading players were invited. The event was sponsored by the cigarette company Benson &amp; Hedges. John Spencer won the inaugural tournament by defeating Ray Reardon 9â8, winning the deciding frame on a re-spotted black. The following year the event moved to the New London Theatre and in 1979 to the Wembley Conference Centre.
In 1981 the number of invited players was increased to 12, then increased again to 16 in 1983.

=== 1984â2003 ===
From 1984 onwards the top 16 players in the world rankings were automatically invited to the tournament. In 1984, Kirk Stevens became the first player to make a maximum break at the event against Jimmy White in the semi-final. In 1988, Mike Hallett became the first and to date only player to be whitewashed in a Masters final, losing 0â9 to Steve Davis. Stephen Hendry maintained an unbeaten record in the event, a run which included five successive championship victories, from his first appearance in 1989 until his defeat by Alan McManus in a final-frame decider in the 1994 final. Hallett reached his second final in four years in 1991, but lost 8â9 against Hendry, despite leading 7â0 and 8â2. This defeat effectively ended Hallett&#x27;s days as a major force in the game.

In 1990 the sponsors introduced two wild-cards, granted by the game&#x27;s governing body at their discretion, who would play wild-card matches against the players seeded 15th and 16th for a place in the first round of the tournament. The Benson &amp; Hedges Championship was introduced for the 1991 tournament; the winner was granted one of the two wild-card places at that season&#x27;s Masters tournament, while the other wild-card place continued to be granted by the governing body.

In the 1997 final, Steve Davis defeated Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in a match disrupted by a streaker. Davis came back from 4â8 down to win the remaining six frames in a row, clinching the final at 10â8. The 1998 final went down to a re-spotted black in the deciding frame; Mark Williams defeated Stephen Hendry 10â9 after having trailed 6â9. In the 2000 final, Ken Doherty missed the final black in a 147 attempt, the first time this had happened in competition. Doherty eventually lost to Matthew Stevens.

=== 2004âpresent ===

After 2003, Benson &amp; Hedges ended their sponsorship of the Masters tournament due to UK restrictions on tobacco advertising. The 2004 event was not sponsored. Rileys Club sponsored the event in 2005. There was no separate qualifying competition for the 2005 event, both wild-card places being awarded by the governing body, but the qualifying event returned the following season. SAGA Insurance took over sponsorship of the Masters in 2006 and agreed a deal later the same year to sponsor the event until 2009. The tournament was held at the Wembley Conference Centre for the last time in 2006, before the venue was demolished months later to make way for redevelopment.

Following the death of Paul Hunter in October 2006, Jimmy White led calls for the Masters trophy or tournament to be renamed in honour of Hunter, who had won the title three times in four years between 2001 and 2004. Hunter&#x27;s widow Lindsey later expressed her wishes for the trophy to be renamed, claiming that &quot;...everybody expected it. Every player I&#x27;ve spoken to, every fan, thought it would be a definite&quot;. The sport&#x27;s governing body, World Snooker, elected not to rename the trophy, making the following statement: &quot;Our board unanimously agreed that the Paul Hunter Scholarship was the most fitting tribute. Just as Hunter himself rose swiftly through the amateur ranks, the scholarship will give a gifted young player the chance to fulfil his talent through elite training.&quot; It would be another nine years before the decision was taken to rename the trophy in honour of Hunter. On 20 April 2016, World Snooker announced the renaming of the trophy for the 2017 event, with chairman Barry Hearn stating that the organisation had &quot;messed up&quot; by not doing so sooner.
Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan appeared in four successive Masters finals from 2004 to 2007, winning the event in 2005 and 2007. Paul Hunter won the first of these four finals to claim his third Masters title in four years; recovering from 2â7 down, he made five century breaks on the way to a 10â9 victory. O&#x27;Sullivan defeated John Higgins in the 2005 final with a decisive 10â3 scoreline. The pair met in the final again the following year, both players producing a very high standard of play throughout the match. O&#x27;Sullivan won the second and third frames with back-to-back total clearances of 138 and 139, but lost all of the next five frames. He made a break of 60 in the deciding frame, before Higgins took the opportunity to make a clearance of 64, winning the title on the black. However, O&#x27;Sullivan redeemed himself in 2007 by defeating Ding Junhui 10â3 in the final and then comforting the clearly upset youngster afterwards. A week earlier, Ding had become the second player to compile a maximum break at the Masters, in his match against Anthony Hamilton in the wild-card round.

The Masters was held at Wembley Arena for the first time in 2007. In a slight change to the format, one extra discretionary wild-card place was awarded, bringing the total number of players up to 19. However, the original format with just two wild-card players was reinstated in 2008. SAGA Insurance pulled out of their sponsorship deal in the summer of 2008, leaving the Masters unsponsored in 2009. PokerStars.com sponsored the event in 2010, and the 2011 sponsor was Ladbrokes Mobile. The separate qualifying competition was not held for the 2011 event and the use of wild-cards was discontinued at the same time. The 2011 final made history as it was the first to feature two Asian players. Wembley Arena was used as the venue for the last time in 2011, after which the tournament moved to the Alexandra Palace in London. BGC Partners sponsored the Masters in 2012, and the 2013 event was sponsored by Betfair. From 2014 to 2020 the tournament was sponsored by Dafabet. World Championship sponsor Betfred sponsored the Masters in 2021, and the 2022 tournament was sponsored by Cazoo for the first time.

Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won his seventh Masters title in 2017, overtaking Stephen Hendry&#x27;s previous record of six. This was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s third Masters title in four years, having also won in 2014 and 2016. He reached the final again in 2019, extending his record number of appearances in the final to 13, in 25 overall appearances at the Masters tournament; however, he was outplayed by Judd Trump who claimed his first Masters title with a solid 10â4 victory. O&#x27;Sullivan chose not to enter the tournament in 2020.

== Format ==
The format has been largely unchanged since 1984 and the tournament generally involves the leading 16 players in the world rankings. There was a wild-card round from 1990 to 2010.

The defending Masters champion is seeded 1 while the current World Champion is seeded 2 (assuming that it is a different player). The remaining places are then allocated to the top players in the world rankings, seeded in order of those rankings. Since the defending champion and current World Champion are normally ranked in the top 16, the field generally consists of the top 16 ranked players. The exceptions have been:
*In 2006, World Champion Shaun Murphy was ranked 21 so that Ian McCulloch, ranked 16, was not automatically invited. McCulloch was, however, the wild-card choice.
*In 2013, Stephen Lee, ranked 9, did not play because he was suspended and so Mark Davis, ranked 17, was invited. World Champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, ranked 20, chose not to enter.
*In 2014, World Champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan was ranked 24 so that Graeme Dott, ranked 16, was not invited.
*In 2015, Ali Carter was seeded 13, despite being ranked 18, because of illness that had stopped him from playing for an extended period, and so Graeme Dott, ranked 16, was not invited.
*In 2018, Stuart Bingham, ranked 12, did not play because he was suspended and so Liang Wenbo, ranked 17, was invited.
*In 2020, Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, ranked 3, chose not to enter and so Ali Carter, ranked 17, was invited.
*In 2021, Judd Trump and Jack Lisowski tested positive for COVID-19 and were forced to withdraw. They were replaced by Joe Perry, ranked 18, and Gary Wilson, ranked 19. Anthony McGill, ranked 17, declined to travel to the event.
*In 2023, Yan Bingtao and Zhao Xintong were suspended amid a match-fixing investigation. David Gilbert and Hossein Vafaei, ranked 17th and 18th at the cutoff, replaced Yan and Zhao respectively.
*In 2025, Neil Robertson, ranked 17th, replaced defending champion and first seed Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan who withdrew.

In 1984, and from 1986 to 1990, the draw was determined by the seedings, with seed 1 playing seed 16, 2 playing 15, 3 playing 14, etc. A slightly different system was used in 1985. With the introduction of the wild-card round in 1990, this system meant that seeds 15 and 16 needed to win a match to reach the last 16, where they would immediately play either of the first two seeds, generally the defending Masters champion and the World Champion. A change was introduced in 1991 so that seeds 9 to 16 were randomly drawn to play seeds 1 to 8.

In 1996 the last-16 and quarter-final rounds were extended from 9 to 11 frames while the final was extended from 17 to 19 frames. Wild-card matches were extended from 9 to 11 frames in 1999.

== Wild-card round ==
For the 21 tournaments from 1990 to 2010 there was a wild-card round in which two additional players (three in 2007) played against the players seeded 15 and 16 (14, 15 and 16 in 2007) to reach the last-16 round. In most years one of the additional players was the winner of the Masters Qualifying Event while the other wild-card was selected. There were no qualifying events for the 1990 and 2005 Masters and both players were selected in those years. There were also two selections in 2007 when the wild-card round was extended to three matches.

The inclusion of wild-card players meant that there were an additional two or three matches to be arranged. The tournament continued to be played over 8 days but three matches were played on Sunday and Monday instead of the usual two (and Tuesday in 2007), so that the last-16 round was still completed on Wednesday. In 2007 all three wild-card matches were played on the first Sunday so that the last-16 round did not start until Monday.

There were a total of 43 wild-card matches. In 19 of these matches the seeded player played the winner of the Qualifying Event. In the remaining 24 matches the seed played a selected wild-card. The players selected as wild-card were Jimmy White (5), Ding Junhui (3), Steve Davis (2), Marco Fu (2), James Wattana (2), Ken Doherty, Peter Ebdon, Andy Hicks, Alex Higgins, John Higgins, Paul Hunter, Stephen Maguire, Ian McCulloch, Ricky Walden and Gary Wilkinson.

None of the players who played in the wild-card round won the tournament although two players, John Higgins (in 1995) and Ding Junhui (in 2007) reached the final. Both these players were wild-card selections. Two seeded players who played in the wild-card round reached the semi-final, Jimmy White (in 2004) and Mark Williams (in 2010). The winner of the Qualifying Event never got beyond the last-16 round.

<text>A drawing pin (in British English) or thumb] tack (in North American English), also called a push-pin, is a short, small pin or nail with a flat, broad head that can be pressed into place with pressure from the thumb, often used for hanging light articles on a wall or noticeboard. 

Thumb tacks made of brass, tin or iron may be referred to as brass tacks, brass pins, tin tacks or iron tacks, respectively.
These terms are particularly used in the idiomatic expression &quot;to come&quot; (or &quot;get&quot;) &quot;down to brass&quot; (or otherwise) &quot;tacks&quot;, meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.

== History ==

The drawing pin was invented in name and first mass-produced in what is now the United States in the mid/late 1750s; the earliest use of the term, Drawing Pin, is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary as 1812. It was said that the use of the newly invented drawing pin to attach notices to school house doors was making significant contribution to the whittling away of their gothic doors. Modern drawing pins were also found as standard in architects&#x27; drawing boxes in the late 18th century.
Edwin Moore patented the &quot;push-pin&quot; in the US in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described them as a pin with a handle. In 1903, in the German town of Lychen, clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed pins for use with drawings, although other sources credit Austrian factory owner Heinrich Sachs with inventing a pin pressed from a single disk of metal in 1888. This style of pin, with the pin formed by a cutout from the head, is still widely sold in Austria under the brand &#x27;Sax&#x27;.

== Design ==

A drawing pin has two basic components: the head, often made of plastic, metal or wood, and the body, usually made of steel or brass. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the pin in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as hearts or stars. Drawing pin heads also come in a variety of colours. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some drawing pin designs have a portion cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a pin.

Domed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed pins may easily point upward, posing a hazard.
Drawing pins also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.

<text>Vassilis Vassilikos (; 18 November 1933 â 30 November 2023) was a Greek writer and diplomat. According to UNESCO data, he is the 9th-most translated Modern Greek author.

== Biography ==
Vassilis Vassilikos was born in Kavala on 18 November 1933. He grew up in Thessaloniki, where he then graduated from school. Afterwards, he studied television directing at Yale University&#x27;s Drama School and moved to Athens to work as a journalist.

Because of his political activities, he was forced into exile for seven years following the coup of 1967. He continued to live and work abroad until his permanent return to Greece in 1994.

From 1981 to 1984, Vassilikos served as the deputy director of the Greek state television channel ERT. From 1996 to 2004, he served as Greece&#x27;s ambassador to UNESCO.

Vassilikos was married twice. His first marriage was with a woman named Mimi, with whom he founded a publishing house. They later divorced because she became a nun. In 1983, he married a lyrical singer, Vasso Papantoniou (born 1939), with whom he had a daughter, Evridiki.

He died on 30 November 2023, at the age of 90. He was buried at the First Cemetery of Athens on 4 December. Vassilikos is survived by his wife and daughter.

== Work ==
Vassilikos published over 100 books, including novels, plays, and poetry. His best-known work is the political novel &quot;Z&quot; (1967), which has been translated into 32 languages and was the basis of the film &quot;Z,&quot; directed by Costa-Gavras. It was also the inspiration of the Indian film Shanghai (2012 film)&quot;.&quot;

== Politics ==
Vassilikos ran in the 2014 Greek local elections as a PASOK candidate for counsellor in the city of Athens.

In the 2019 Greek legislative election, he was elected as a Member of Parliament with Syriza.

<text>An au pair (; : au pairs) is a person working for, and living as part of, a host family. Typically, au pairs take on a share of the familyâs responsibility for child care as well as some housework, and receive a monetary allowance or stipend for personal use. Au pair arrangements are often subject to government restrictions which specify an age range usually from mid teens to late twenties, and may explicitly limit the arrangement to females. The au pair program is considered a form of cultural exchange that gives the family and the au pairs a chance to experience and learn new cultures.

Arrangements differ between Europe, where the concept originated, and North America. In Europe, au pairs are only supposed to work part-time, and they often also study part-time, generally focusing on the language of the host country. In the United States, they may provide full-time childcare. In 1969, the European Agreement on Au Pair Placement was signed, and it came into force in 1971. Au pair companies in the United States have significant non-refundable fees once the au pair arrives in the country. The contract does not guarantee childcare, despite many families&#x27; reliance on the program.

Unlike many other types of domestic assistants, the au pair is considered a part of the host family and not merely an employee. In some countries the au pair wears a uniform, but more commonly the au pair only follows the host family&#x27;s dress code and wears attire appropriate for the work description, typically including a protective apron.

==History==
The title comes from the French term , meaning &#x27;at par&#x27; or &#x27;equal to&#x27;, indicating that the relationship is intended to be one of equals: the au pair is intended to become a member of the family, albeit a temporary one, rather than a traditional domestic worker.

The term was historically used in a broad sense to indicate economic parity between the &#x27;employer&#x27; and their &#x27;employee&#x27;. Thus it is found used in 1840 by HonorÃ© de Balzac:

==Concept and conditions==

The concept of the au pair originated in Europe after World War II. Before the war, an abundant supply of domestic servants had been available to look after the children of middle and upper-class families, but changes in social attitudes, and increases in wages and taxes after the war, made the old system inaccessible to most middle-class parents. At the same time, social change increased the number of middle-class girls who needed to earn their own living, and rising educational aspirations for girls made experiencing foreign cultures and learning foreign languages more common aspirations.

However, due to the stigma attached to being a &quot;servant&quot;, an essentially working-class status that even working-class people were repudiating, this potential supply for domestic labour could only be utilised if a new non-servant role was created. Thus the au pair was born. The au pair was supposed to be treated as a member of the family rather than a servant, and was not required to wear a uniform.

An au pair receives an allowance and their own room. The usual practice is that au pairs eat with the family most of the time, and join in some of the usual family activities such as outings and trips. However, host families ordinarily expect to have some private time to themselves, particularly in the evenings. During this time, an au pair might retire to their room to watch television, study, or go out with friends. Provision is often made for the au pair to have time for studying, especially the language of the host country. The Council of Europe recommends that au pairs be issued standard contracts with their family.

Some au pairs are now male, but females remain the overwhelming majority. Many governments impose limits as to how many hours an au pair is allowed to work. Tasks can include taking children to and from school, taking children to after-school activities, cooking, cleaning, ironing, tidying up and babysitting. Each placement varies depending on the host family.

In many developing countries, an abundant supply of local domestic labour is still available, so there is little or no demand for au pairs.

Au pair relationships between host families and au pairs can be established through various means. Traditionally, au pair agencies located in a given host country have served as an intermediary between young people seeking to become au pairs and families in the country that are interested in hosting an au pair. Such agencies typically charge a fee to the host family for fulfilling an intermediary role between the host family and possible au pairs. The agency conducts some process of screening and evaluation of prospective au pairs and then proposes possible au pairs to the host families, who are their principal customers. Traditional agencies also assist with the arrangement of some of the bureaucratic formalities associated with an au pair visit.

In recent years, the basic function of bringing aspiring au pairs and interested host families together has increasingly been provided by websites that allow families and au pairs to post online profiles and search for each other directly on the basis of the information provided in these profiles. Such websites supplement this search functionality with various information offerings about au pair requirements in different countries as well as by providing user support for their registered users. Charges are made to users of such websites to allow a full exchange of the personal contact details necessary for finalizing an au pair placement.

This approach typically gives prospective au pairs and host families a wider range of choices and more direct control over the selection process than is possible through a traditional agency at a considerably lower price than traditional agencies charge. At the same time, use of such websites requires an aspiring host family or au pair to invest more personal effort in the search process and to make their selection and arrange the formalities of an au pair stay without the involvement of a third party.

==Asia-Pacific==
===Australia===
Australia has no official au pair program through the government. Visas that can be used by au pairs are the Working Holiday and Work and Holiday Visa, which both provide working rights. Students, especially those who study English, often become demi-pairs to immerse themselves in the language and culture of Australia. Au pair arrangements in Australia and work hours vary from 10 to 40 hours per week.

The &quot;Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia&quot; (&quot;CAPAA&quot;) Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia was formed in 2012 on a not-for-profit basis and is the only approved Australian association member of the international Au Pair Association IAPA. CAPAA is an industry-based association, with the purpose of protecting and developing the au pair experience as a rewarding cultural exchange programme. Member agencies agree to abide by the code of conduct developed by the International Au Pair Association and CAPAA. CAPAA&#x27;s members also agree to meet strict business and ethical standards to ensure competence, fair dealing and high integrity.

The &quot;Australian Au-Pair Families Association&quot; is a not-for-profit organisation and members are Australian host families. In comparison to CAPAA, it supports self-regulation in the Au pair industry, and provides information and guidance to Au-Pair families based on international hosting standards and ethics.

Those wanting to come to Australia will need a working holiday visa (417) or a Work &amp; Holiday visa (462) to Au pair.

===China===
Au pair agencies in China sent young Chinese to Western nations to work as au pairs abroad, particularly for families who had adopted babies from China, to help them learn Chinese. In addition, China&#x27;s rising middle class and economic growth have led to a growing demand for au pairs. This helps create opportunities to learn English at an early age, as well as the opportunity for mothers to return to work and have additional help in raising the children. However, the main goal for most families hiring au pairs is primarily to help their children as well as themselves learn English, as the mother has the biggest role in raising the children.

To be an au pair in China, participants need to apply for an X or an F visa. The first one is required for internships, studies and long term courses. The F visa entitles a person to live in China to take part in a cultural exchange, study tours or language courses.

=== New Zealand ===
Au pairs are required to obtain a NZ Working Holiday Visa. Prospective au pairs can find host families directly or via an agency. Agencies can require at least 200 hours childcare experience prior to making an application, as well as police and medical background checks that are additional to those required of all au pairs in the visa process. New Zealand au pair agencies seek to safeguard both au pair and host family well-being. Most New Zealand au pair agencies are members of the International Au Pair Association and will also require au pairs to implement the early childhood education curriculum, Te WhÄriki.

===Turkey===
Turkey is a transcontinental country that spans Europe and Asia; thus Turkish culture is heterogeneous and diversified. As culture and aspirations of this multi-ethnic country have recently turned to Europe, where the Au Pair Programs are especially popular, Turkey may be considered one of the most popular non-EU country among the Au Pairs.

Nevertheless, the Au Pair Programs are still something brand-new and unusual in Turkey, what makes it a great opportunity for both young people, tempted by a unique Turkish culture, and for families, looking for a reliable caregiver for their children.

One of the biggest obstacles towards becoming flourishing centre of the Au Pairs&#x27; community is the visa requirement for foreigners. Entering Turkey without a valid visa is impossible for Au Pairs â and to apply for a visa any potential Au Pair needs both an Au Pair contract and an invitation letter, what significantly reduces the number of people willing to make an effort and go through such a complicated application process.

==Europe==
===Austria===
The tradition of au pairing is well established in Austria, and prospective au pairs are served by several agencies that are accustomed to dealing with direct applications from foreigners. Agencies often charge their au pairs a fee equivalent to a week&#x27;s pocket money and will tell the au pair where to take the documents to be stamped for a fee.

Officially, au pairs from outside Europe must obtain both a work and residence permit (BeschÃ¤ftigungsbewilligung). The employing family should apply at their local employment office at least two weeks before the start date. Before the permit can be approved and an AnzeigebestÃ¤tigung issued, the authorities must see an agreement or contract (signed by the employer and the au pair) and proof that health and accident insurance cover has been obtained by the au pair.

===Belgium===

In Belgium, au pairs must take part in a Dutch, French, or German language course (according to the region) offered by an officially recognised institution â private tuition, distance learning courses, or private school courses are not accepted. An au pair without a basic knowledge of the host country&#x27;s language will have to attend an intensive language course upon arriving in Belgium. The host family will also prepare a cultural programme.

Nationals of all countries (except the States of the European Union, Iceland, Monaco, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) who want to stay more than three months in Belgium are subject to the visa/work permit requirement. Non-EU members who want to work as an au pair in Belgium must be in possession of:
* a passport valid for at least one year
* a recent certificate of good conduct covering the last five years
* a medical certificate obtained from a doctor approved by the Embassy
* an employment authorization, which must be requested by the Belgian host family and issued along with the work permit B.
* The application must be submitted in time to allow for a possible investigation by the Foreign Office.

Providing childcare is the main responsibility of an au pair, though the host family may also request some light housework. All tasks are defined in the official au pair contract and cannot be changed by the au pair or the host family. The au pair receives free board and lodging, and is entitled to food and accommodation in cases of illness and holidays. She also has her own bedroom and key to the house. The host family subscribes to health and accident insurance, as well as an insurance for potential repatriation costs for the au pair.

In Belgium, an au pair is entitled to at least 450 euros pocket money per month, deposited to her bank account. The au pair is entitled to the full amount of monthly pocket money in cases of illness and during holidays. Au pairs are not allowed to work more than 4 hours per day (babysitting hours included) and 20 hours per week, spread out over a maximum of 6 days per week. Au pairs are entitled to at least one day off per week and at least one whole weekend per month. Holiday entitlement is not regulated in Belgium, but it is recommended that an au pair receives a minimum of 2 weeks&#x27; holiday.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, an au pair must be between 18 and 30 years old, must be able to master at least one of the following languages: English, German, Danish, Swedish or Norwegian. The daily working schedule must be at least 3 and a maximum of 5 hours, that is between 18 and 30 hours a week. The au pair must have at least one and a half days off a week.

The au pair is to be regarded as a family member that means being equal to the other family members and participating in the everyday life of the host family. In return for her/his work, the au pair receives board and lodging, pocket money (from 4,550 DKK 2021 level) and access to follow language courses at language schools.

The au pair usually are allowed to stay with their host family maximum period of 24 months, but no longer than stated in the contract. Though, the au pair visa does not constitute the grounds for a settlement either work permit.

The host family is responsible for the entry and return ticket to/from Denmark if the au pair comes from a country outside the EU / EEA or Switzerland. In addition, the host family is responsible for a one-time fee, which is intended to cover part of the state&#x27;s expenses for the Danish language lessons.

===Finland===
An au pair&#x27;s responsibilities also include light domestic work for a maximum of 25 hours per week. The au pair must have at least one full free day every week, and two successive free days at least every second week. The au pair has her/his own room, is provided with food, and is paid a weekly allowance amounting to at least â¬280 per month (minimum set by Finnish law). Additionally, the host family will arrange a Finnish or Swedish language course to help the au pair communicate better with the children and get more out of their stay in Finland. Au pairs can stay with their host family for up to one year or negotiate a shorter stay. Anyone, except citizens of the Nordic countries or the EU/EEA countries, wishing to work in Finland as an au pair must apply for and receive a residence permit before entering Finland. Citizens of EU states, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland must register their right to reside in Finland, but they do not need a residence permit.

===France===
Au pairing has long been a favored way for young women to learn French and, increasingly, for young men as well. The pocket money for au pairs in France is 60 euro per week, plus, in most cases, a 20 euro a week contribution to language classes; in Paris families may also provide a carte Navigo (urban travel pass) which is worth 95 euros (approximately). Enrollment in a French language course is compulsory for non-European au pairs.

While France does not have an official, government sponsored Au Pair Program, a number of established agencies belong to UFAAP, the Union Francaise des Associations Au Pair, an umbrella group set up in 1999, based at Europair Services in Paris. As such, many au pairs enter France using a student visa where au pairs are limited to working no more than 5 hours a day, 30 hours a week, and pay is generally between 250 and 300 Euros.

;Application criteria
Potential au pairs must:
* Be aged 17â27.
* Have basic skills in French.
* Be able to commit to a period of at least 10 months (most host families prefer Au Pairs who can stay for the school year from September to June).
* Attend French language classes while in France (this is a requirement to obtain the Long-Stay Au Pair Visa).

===Germany===
Many independent agents are members of the Au Pair Society which has two offices in Germany and more than 40 members. The Society&#x27;s website carries contact details for its members with links to agency websites. Commercial au pair agencies do not charge a placement fee to incoming au pairs.

The Au-Pair Society e.V. is a member of the International Au Pair Association and is also in a committee ECAPS (European Committee for Au-Pair Standards) where members of National Organisation from several European countries have defined new Standards for Au-Pair program in Europe.

Non-EU citizens no older than 24 can become au pairs through a German agency. Americans and Canadians do not need to apply for a residence and work permit before leaving their home countries; however, it is a general requirement that au pairs prove that they have studied German.

As per Au Pair Wave agency, the monthly pocket money for an au pair in Germany was raised to 280 euros ($300+) in 2023. The majority of families also give their au pairs a monthly travel pass and other benefits such as a contribution to course fees or travel expenses.

;Application criteria
Potential au pair in Germany must:
* Age: Between 18 and 26 years old.
* Language Skills: Basic knowledge of German (at least A1 level).
* Marital Status: Unmarried and without children.

===Italy===
In order to become an Au Pair in Italy, Au Pairs need to:
* Be between 18 and 30 years old
* Have a good command in Italian or English
* Be entitled to a visa if they do not belong to any EU-country. In this case, the Italian embassy placed at the Au Pair&#x27;s home country will decide to approve or deny the Au Pair&#x27;s application.

The Au Pair program in Italy establishes that:
* Au Pairs will work a maximum of 30 hours per week
* Au Pairs will have 4 weeks paid holiday for a 12-months stay
* Au Pairs will have at least one day off per week
* Au Pairs will earn a monthly amount of 260 euro
* Au Pairs will pay for the travel expenses to the Host Family&#x27;s country

Additional information:

* Au Pairs who belong to a non-EU country member will have to apply for a visa. For that, visa requirements must be fulfilled and documents must be provided to the Italian embassy placed in their home country
* Au Pairs from a non-EU country will need to close a private insurance from their home country
* Au Pairs who come from any EU-country can apply for the European Health Insurance Card

It is possible to apply independently through an Italian agency. There are many opportunities for au pairs during the summer holidays, when most Italians who can afford au pairs migrate to the coast or the mountains and take their helpers with them. The weekly pocket money is 75â95 euro for working 30 hours a week, and 100â130 euro for 40 hours, though many families in larger cities pay more than this.

Non-European nationals are not eligible for a Permesso di Soggiorno (stay permit) unless they arrive with the appropriate visa from the Italian embassy in their country. The best route is to obtain a student visa which permits the holder to work up to 20 hours per week (live-in or live-out). To obtain a long-stay visa, non-EU au pairs will need to enroll in and pay for an Italian language course at an approved school or college. The school registrar will issue a certificate which must then be stamped by the local police office (Questura). The visa will be valid only for the length of the course. The applicant must show sufficient insurance coverage, a return air ticket, proof of accommodation stamped by the police and a contract specifying dates, pocket money and benefits stamped by the provincial labor office and/or the police.

American citizens cannot legally work as au pairs on a working visa; the nulla osta will be denied because there are no labor agreements between the US and Italy in regards to au pairs.
If the applicant is already in Italy she can check classified adverts in English language journals, many of which are published online such as &quot;Wanted in Rome&quot; aimed at the expatriate community, and notice boards in English language bookshops, English-speaking churches, student travel agencies, and language school notice boards.

===Netherlands===
Au pairs may only be placed with a host family in the Netherlands through an au pair agency recognized by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) of the Netherlands. Interested au pair candidates must be older than 18 but not yet 31 and interested in learning about Dutch society and culture.

If you are an EU citizen, you do not need a visa to work as an au pair in the Netherlands. After you have been in the Netherlands for three months, you must register with the IND. When you register, you must provide documents to verify the purpose of your stay. After registering, you will receive proof of registration in the form of a sticker, which will be attached to your passport (or other proof of identity).

As a Dutch national host family, if you wish to bring an au pair to the Netherlands for longer than three months, you must meet the following conditions:
* Your family must consist of a minimum of 2 persons
* You must support the au pair during their stay in the Netherlands
* Au pair is registered in the Municipal Personal Records Database (BRP)
* Your family must have sufficient income to support the au pair and yourselves
* Family must publish a daily schedule of duties
The au pair must have the following documents and meet the following conditions:
* A valid passport
* Health insurance that covers the au pair in the Netherlands
* Cannot be married
* Cannot have dependents or be responsible for the care of their family members
* They do not constitute a risk to the public order
* They must undergo a tuberculosis test in the Netherlands
* They are over 18 but not older than 25
* They have not previously stayed in the Netherlands on a residence permit
* They did not previously work for your family abroad
* They will only carry out light domestic work to assist your family
* They will work a maximum of 8 hours per day and a maximum of 30 hours per week; you will have 2 days off per week
&quot;Placement period&quot;

An au pair in the Netherlands is allowed to stay for a maximum of one year.

&quot;Duties&quot;

Providing childcare and doing light household chores are the main responsibilities. A daily schedule of duties is drawn up by the host family.

&quot;Pocket money&quot;

In the Netherlands, an au pair receives 300-340 euros pocket money per month.

&quot;Board and lodging&quot;

An au pair receives free board and lodging, and is entitled to board and lodging in cases of illness and holidays.

&quot;Working hours&quot;

In the Netherlands, the weekly working schedule of an au pair must not exceed a total of 30 hours. They may never work more than 8 hours a day or more than 5 days per week. Additional babysitting for the host family or taking on a job on the side is also not allowed.

&quot;Free time&quot;

An au pair in the Netherlands is entitled to a minimum of two days off per week; however, these days do not have to be consecutive.

&quot;Holiday&quot;

An au pair in the Netherlands is entitled to a minimum of 2 weeks paid holiday per 12 months. They and the host family can take this value as a basis for calculating the amount of holiday in case of a shorter placement.

&quot;Language course/cultural exchange&quot;

An au pair is entitled to attend a language course. The host family assists in finding suitable offers within their area, and contributes 320 euros per year to a language course. The au pair programme in the Netherlands is explicitly designed for a cultural exchange. Therefore, the host family will help the au pair to experience Dutch culture through various cultural activities.

===Norway===
As of the autumn of 2022, the authorities were scheduled to abolish the possibility for working as au pair in Norway; however in November 2022, one lawyer who has had many au pairs as clients, said that she has not seen any indication of that. Furthermore, media said that there are now 846 [legally working as au pairs, or] permits for au pairs; furthermore, if an au pair changes employee - the government&#x27;s &quot;au pair fee&quot; (Norwegian kroner 9,100) has to be paid again.

The number of au pairs in Norway have more than quadrupled between the years 2000 and 2014. 81 percent of au pairs were females from the Philippines. In 2015, there were around 3000 au pairs in Norway. To compare, in 2000, there were 691 au pairs with the permit to stay in Norway.

==== Rights and regulations ====
As of April 2019, the host family is required to pay the au pair a minimum of NOK 5900 per month (pre-tax) as pocket money/salary. Since the au pair programme is a cultural exchange programme, the au pair also has the right to attend courses in Norwegian. The host family must provide a minimum of NOK 8850 pre-tax for the au pair&#x27;s Norwegian lessons and study materials. The au pair&#x27;s additional rights include, among other things: free board and lodging; holiday pay in accordance with the Holidays Act; and one full day (24 hours) off per week. The au pair is required to pay taxes. According to regulations [as of 2016] &quot;the period of work shall normally not exceed five hours per day, and the maximum shall be 30 hours a week&quot;.

If a host family fails to follow the regulations, they can lose the right to have an au pair for one, two, or five years, according to a rule introduced in July 2013. If the host family commits an offense punishable by three months in prison or more, the host family quarantine could last up to 10 years.

==== Controversies regarding the au pair system ====
The au pair system has, in recent years, been a topic of dispute in the Norwegian public. According to lawyer Lene LÃ¸vdal, &quot;The au pair scheme is all about cheap in-house female work force. The majority of the au pairs in Norway do not primarily come here for the cultural exchange. First and foremost theyâre professional housemaids.&quot; In 2013, the Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; reported that au pairs in Norway occasionally show up at PTA meetings, in the place of children&#x27;s parents.

A documentary about au pairs in Norway, &quot;Herskap og tenarar&quot; (&quot;masters and Servants&quot;), was broadcast on the TV channel NRK in 2013. The documentary examines the rights of au pairs in Norway, and focuses particularly on recent cases of abuse and exploitation against some au pairs from the Philippines.

In 2016 the government cancelled funding for &quot;Au-pair senteret&quot; (over the state budget); in a &quot;Dagsavisen&quot; article Kadra Yusuf said that &quot;We have become a class-divided society and we have servants. ... and the responsibility that goes along. The first step must be that the government keeps the au-pair center open. That, the masters (or the master race) can afford, or what?&quot;

In 2020, 45 persons were temporarily banned from employing au pairs; the family [or household] of those persons, can not employ au pairs for a determinate number of years; in the previous year, 9 persons received temporary bans.

==== 2020 conviction of four employers ====
In 2020, a billionaire and his wife were each sentenced to 75 days in prison, and proceeds of the crime were confiscated: Norwegian kroner 186,000; their friends, a married couple, received a suspended prison sentence: 30 days for one, and 18 days for the wife. Previously, in the lower court system, a trial was scheduled from 3 January 2017 until 18 January, with all four found guilty later in 2017. The four persons were charged with wrongfully having claimed: that they only had one au pair; that the au pair was to participate in Norwegian language courses; and that the person would not be working as a housekeeper. In addition, all are charged with having violated Utlendingsloven (&quot;foreigners act&quot;): one count is in regard to trafficking of the type that is punishable for up to three years.

=== Spain ===
The minimum pocket money for au pairs is 70 euros a week. There are also opportunities for young people to stay with Spanish families in exchange for speaking English with the children without having any domestic or childcare duties.

According to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the holder of an au pair visa must be between 17 and 30 years of age. They have the following rights, among others:
# Duration of the agreement, not longer than one year.
# Participation in household chores and duties, not more than 5 hours daily.
# Minimum of one complete free day a week. For the student &quot;Au Pair&quot; to attend to religious activities, one free day a month must be a Sunday.
# Exact address where the student &quot;Au Pair&quot; will be residing with the host family, enjoying at the same time a certain degree of independence.
# Determined monthly pocket money that the student &quot;Au Pair&quot; will receive.
# Conditions that would allow either party to reject the Placement Agreement with an advance notice of two weeks.
The Embassy requires both an offer of employment from the family, and a letter from an authorized educational institution in Spain, confirming the au pair&#x27;s enrollment in a full-time course. The au pair must also provide &quot;proof of economic means to cover living expenses and eventual return to the country of origin.

===Sweden===
There is no need for an agency in order to become an au pair in Sweden. Au pairs need to be between 18 and 30, have a valid passport, and not have any children. The Swedish Migration Authorities require that the applicant has a definite interest in learning or using the Swedish language. They are also required to have a certificate of admission to a Swedish course at time of application. Au pairs should not work for more than 25 hours a week, and combined with studies cannot exceed 40 hours a week. The required monthly allowance is SEK 3500 before tax.

As for tasks and rights, the official Swedish Migration Agency states: &quot;An au pair is a person who lives with another family and is paid for child minding and light housework . The purpose of their stay in Sweden must be to obtain international experience and the opportunity to learn Swedish language and culture.&quot;

===Switzerland===
The applicant must be a female between the ages of 17 (18 in Geneva) and 29 from Western Europe, North America, Australia, or New Zealand, stay for a minimum of one year and a maximum of 18 months, and attend a minimum of three hours a week of language classes in ZÃ¼rich, four in Geneva. Families in most places are required to pay half the language school fees of 500â1,000 Swiss francs for six months.

Au pairs in Switzerland work for a maximum of 30 hours per week, plus babysitting once or twice a week. The monthly salary varies among cantons but the normal range is 590â740 Swiss francs after all deductions for tax and health insurance have been made.

===United Kingdom===
Until Brexit au pairs mainly came to the UK from the European Economic Area under European freedom of movement regulations.

Historically, au pairs came to the UK under an Au Pair immigration category, which was closed in November 2008 Home Office when a new points-based system was introduced, which included a Youth Mobility Scheme under tier 5 of the points based system Youth Mobility Scheme for the nationals of Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Monaco.

While au pairs are not classified as regular workers in the UK, they may be required to pay income tax and National Insurance depending on the wages received: they are entitled to the UK minimum wage. 

Unlike the requirements of other countries, au pairs are not required to attend a language course in the UK. Should the au pair want to enroll in a course, they are responsible for the cost. Though it is recommended that the host family assist in finding a suitable course.

In the UK, there are many au pair agencies that provide assistance to families looking to engage au pairs. These agencies are all privately owned and are not regulated by the UK government.

==North America==
===Canada===
Au pair programs do not exist in Canada in the same format as the rest of the world. The Canadian government has the live-in caregiver program, which has broader requirements than the au pair program. Standard qualifications are regulated federally, though conditions of employment are determined at a provincial level. Requirements include a minimum of six months of training or one year of compatible employment within the past three years, though exceptions and additional stipulations do apply. Such regulations and complicating bureaucratic procedures are the driving force behind the creation of live-in caregiver (or nanny) placement agencies, who act as a mediator between families, caregivers, and the government - providing support for documentation and advice on the program.

===United States===
Interest in the Au Pair Program in the United States picked up in 1987, when two educational and cultural exchange agencies were designated by the United States Information Agency (USIA) to conduct a program under the FulbrightâHays Act of 1961. This would allow foreign nationals the opportunity to live with an American host family and participate directly in the home life of the host family. After testing the program with approximately 200 au pairs, Congress instructed that the program be continued. The Au Pair Program was officially enacted in 1989. In that same year, the program was expanded to include four additional agencies, and these agencies together became the original six government designated Au pair organizations in the United States.

The United States au pair program offers qualified young people the opportunity to live and study in the U.S. for one or two years in exchange for providing up to 45 hours of childcare per week and no more than 10 hours a day. In 2006, the au pair program was also granted permission from the U.S. Department of State to offer a second year extension au pair program (6, 9 or 12 months), as well as a summer au pair program which was later discontinued.

At the same time, the au pairs are required to complete an educational component of six semester hours of academic credit or its equivalent. Au pairs are provided with up to $500 toward the cost of the required academic course work by their host families. At the end of one year, au pairs generally return to their home country, unless they and their host families choose to extend their stay for a further 6, 9, or 12 months. Alternatively, the au pair can choose to extend their period in the US with a different family. Most au pairs choose a family in a different part of the country, allowing them to have a new experience.

In the US, au pairs are provided a private bedroom, meals, compensation tied to the minimum wage ($195.75 per week as of 24 July 2009), 1.5 days off weekly plus a full weekend off each month, two weeks&#x27; paid vacation, and the first $500 toward the costs of required course work to be completed at an accredited institution of higher education in order to satisfy the requirements of the educational component of the program. Au pairs are not to work more than 10 hours per day and no more than 45 hours per week, and are not to serve as general housekeepers or assume responsibility for household management.

The US EduCare Au Pair Program is also available for families with school-age children. In this program, the au pair works a lower number of hours (not more than 10 hours a day and not more than 30 hours a week) for a weekly minimum wage of $146.81, as of 2009. The family pays $1000 in educational expenses, and the au pair is required to complete 12 hours of academic credit.

Au pairs placed with families who have children under two years old must have at least 200 hours of child care experience with infants under two. Au pairs may only be placed in a family with an infant under three months old if a parent or other adult caregiver is also home and fully responsible for the infant.

The Au Pair Program is administered by the US Department of State. Participating families and au pairs must work with one of the approved agencies. Au pairs enter the United States on a J-1 visa. Some au pairs also use a tourist visa, which is illegal, since this document does not enable them to work in the USA.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, an au pair will almost always be a nonresident alien, and will be required to file a tax return on Form 1040NR or Form 1040NR-EZ to report their au pair wages. These wages, however, are not usually subject to social security and Medicare taxes because of the au pair&#x27;s status as a J-1 nonimmigrant and as a nonresident alien. However, if the au pair had previously been in the United States as a student, teacher, trainee, or researcher in F, J, M, or Q nonimmigrant status, then the au pair might be a resident alien during their current stay in the United States, and might be subject to social security and Medicare taxes if their annual au pair wages exceed the applicable dollar threshold found in IRS Publication 926. If the au pair is a resident alien and their annual au pair wages exceed the applicable dollar threshold, then the host family must withhold social security and Medicare taxes and report them on Schedule H of Form 1040 and on Form W-2. The host family must apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) if it is required to withhold tax and file Form W-2.

====Basic application criteria====
Potential au pairs must be aged 18â26 (at the time of arrival) and have no criminal record.

Unless the au pair is in a federally funded exchange program, sponsor organizations charge participants program fees. Fees vary from sponsor to sponsor based on the exchange category, the sponsor&#x27;s program, program duration, etc.

====Au pair program types in the United States====
Au pairs in the United States are categorized by program types. Most au pair organizations in the United States classify au pairs by the following programs:

Standard Au Pair Program

The Standard Au Pair program is the most popular program available. Standard au pairs can work up to 45 hours per week and no more than 10 hours per day. They are paid the standard stipend amount and fulfill the minimum educational requirement of 6 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during the program year. Families hosting standard au pairs are required to provide (up to) the first $500 toward the cost of the au pair&#x27;s academic course work. Standard au pairs are usually available for a full year commitment and have a variety of qualifications. If a family has a child under the age of two, the au pair has to have at least 200 hours of experience. The minimum stipend for an Au Pair is U$195.75 per week, being U$4.35/hour.

Professional Au Pair Program

The Professional Au Pair program is for families who need more than just a babysitter and have higher child care needs, due to a new baby, multiple children or children with special needs. Professional au pairs have degrees in child care related fields such as pre-school teacher, pediatric nursing or occupational therapy for children or one or two years full-time experience with children. A professional au pair can work up to 45 hours per week and no more than 10 hours per day. They are often paid a higher stipend amount and fulfill the minimum educational requirement of 6 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during the program year. Families hosting professional au pairs are required to provide (up to) the first $500 toward the cost of the au pair&#x27;s academic course work. Professional au pairs are usually available for a full year commitment and have a variety of qualifications. Cost are typically higher for a special needs au pair. Numerous agencies offer professional Au Pair programs including Au Pair International and PROaupair.

The Educare Program

The Educare Program was created as an option for families with school aged children or families looking for part-time child care. According to the U.S. Department of State, the Educare Au Pair Program applies to families who require childcare before and after school and may not be placed with families that have preschool aged children except if other, full-time childcare plans have been made.

Educare au pairs may work no more than 10 hours per day, and a maximum of 30 hours per week. Au Pairs participating in the Educare component receive 75 percent of the weekly rate paid to non-Educare participants. Educare au pairs must complete a minimum of 12 hours of academic credit or its equivalent during their program year. The host family is required to provide (up to) the first $1,000 toward the cost of the au pair&#x27;s required academic course work.

The Extension Program

When the Au Pair Program started in the United States in 1989, au pairs were only allowed to stay in the country and work as au pairs for a 12-month period. In 2006, the U.S. Department of State allowed au pairs to legally extend their stay and work for 6, 9, or 12 additional months.

The program&#x27;s regulations state that the Department of State may approve extensions for the au pair participants. The request for an extension beyond the maximum duration of the initial 12-month program must be submitted electronically to the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) no less than 30 calendar days prior to the expiration of the exchange visitor&#x27;s initial authorized stay in any program.

During your extension period you will not be allowed to leave the country, i.e. during your extension period you will have to stay within the country where you are doing the exchange and you will not travel to your home country or other countries because the stay for the second year is through another legal document and the J1 visa will not remain valid.

Repeat participation

In 2008, the U.S. Department of State re-designated the au pair requirements and regulations and added a repeat participation clause that states a foreign national who enters the United States as an au pair exchange visitor program participant and who has successfully completed their program is eligible to participate again as an au pair participant, provided that they have resided outside the United States for at least two years following completion of their initial au pair program.

The Au Pair Abroad Program (The Reciprocity Clause)

With the creation of the Au Pair Program in the United States in 1989, the U.S. Department of State also added a reciprocity clause in the general program requirements which states that in the conduct of their exchange programs, official au pair sponsor agencies shall make a good faith effort to achieve the fullest possible reciprocity in the exchange of persons.

Reciprocity means the participation of a US citizen in an educational and cultural program in a foreign country in exchange for the participation of a foreign national in the exchange visitor program. &quot;Reciprocity&quot; is interpreted broadly here; unless otherwise specified, reciprocity does not require a one-for-one exchange or that exchange visitors be engaged in the same activity. For example, exchange visitors coming to the United States for training in American banking practices and Americans going abroad to teach foreign nationals public administration would be considered a reciprocal exchange, when arranged or facilitated by the same sponsor.

The Au Pair Summer Program (discontinued)

The Au Pair Summer Program started in 2005, when the U.S. Department of State ran a three-year pilot program. The program was extended for an additional year before it was discontinued in 2009. The Au Pair Summer Program faced logistical complications with DS-2019 forms, visa approvals around the world and lack of interest from American host families in this particular program. Summer au pairs were exactly like standard au pairs, except their visas were granted for only a few months instead of a full year. Since 2009, none of the U.S. Department of State sponsor agencies are allowed to offer this program for families in the United States.

====Sponsoring au pair agencies in the United States====

, the U.S. State Department listed fifteen designated sponsoring au pair agencies. Host families typically pay these agencies an application fee and a program fee which varies from $7,500 to $10,500, depending on the agency used. The program fees cover expenses related to the arrival of the au pair and compliance with regulations governing the program. These include airfare, medical insurance, mandatory 32-hour education session on child development and safety and other expenses. Au pairs pay fees which vary depending on the US agency and the home country agency they use (if they do not apply directly to the US agency).

Au Pair online profile

An online profile is one of the most important steps for any au pair searching for a family. Families using the profile to get to know the au pair before scheduling an interview. It is therefore crucial that au pairs have a professional profile that is accessible at all times with a fully working contact form. Typically, an Au Pair online profile includes a candidate&#x27;s personal and contact data, information on their professional background, skills, lifestyle habits, and work-related preferences. Au pairs need to be aware that having private information publicly available could be dangerous. It is therefore important to have a private working email.

==== Chinese au pairs in the US ====
The au pair concept was introduced in China in 2001 by the HHS Center (the first au pair agency in China), and was transcribed &quot;Hu Hui Sheng&quot; in Pinyin (). In 2007, negotiations between agencies in China and the United States were successful and the American Cultural Exchange became the first organization to bring a Chinese au pair to the United States. In March 2007, the first Chinese au pair arrived in the United States.

Chinese au pairs are desirable by American host families, attributed to the growing number of Chinese baby adoptions and the desire of parents to teach their children Mandarin, to capitalize on China&#x27;s economic influence.

<doc id="703185" wikidata="Q2376848" url="?curid=703185" title="London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange">
<text>The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE, pronounced &#x27;life&#x27;) was a futures exchange based in London. In 2014, following a series of takeovers, LIFFE became part of Intercontinental Exchange, and was renamed [[Intercontinental Exchange Futures|ICE Futures Europe]].
Euronext acquired LIFFE in 2002, and were then in turn taken over by NYSE in 2007, to form NYSE Euronext. In the same manner, Intercontinental Exchange then purchased NYSE Euronext in 2013. 

==History==
The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE), established by Sir Brian Williamson started life on 30 September 1982, to take advantage of the removal of currency controls in the UK in 1979. The exchange modelled itself after the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It initially offered futures contracts and options linked to short-term interest rates. In 1993 LIFFE merged with the &quot;London Traded Options Market&quot; (LTOM), adding equity options to its product range. This is when it changed its name to the London International Financial Futures &quot;and Options&quot; Exchange. In 1996 it merged with the &quot;London Commodity Exchange&quot; (LCE), and, as a result, a range of soft and agricultural commodity contracts was added to its products offering. Trading was conducted by open outcry, where traders meet on the trading floor (in what is called &quot;the pit&quot;) to conduct trades. The Exchange was originally housed in the historic Royal Exchange building near Bank but then moved to Cannon Bridge in 1991.

By the end of 1996, LIFFE was by far the biggest futures exchange in Europe, followed by the MATIF in Paris and the Deutsche TerminbÃ¶rse (DTB) in Frankfurt. The DTB was an electronic exchange founded in 1990 and the predecessor to Eurex. LIFFE&#x27;s most-traded product was a futures contract on &quot;Bunds&quot;, the 10-year German Government Bond. The DTB offered an identical product but, as an electronic exchange, it had a lower cost base. The progress of DTB can be gauged from the fact that in mid-1997 the DTB had less than 25% of the market. By October, it had more than 50%, and a couple of months later LIFFE was left with only 10%. The Bund represented about a third of LIFFE&#x27;s business. The exchange, which had turned in a profit of Â£57m in 1997, reported a loss of Â£64m in 1998. Its ambitious plans for enlarged trading floor and offices on a site near Spitalfields market were dropped (and became the ABN Amro UK HQ).

==Move to electronic trading==

LIFFE had had big plans to expand, and intended to redevelop Spitalfields Market in the City of London as they needed a larger building for their open outcry. With the loss of the market for their main product, Bund futures contracts, all expansion plans were shelved. LIFFE realised that, to compete, it had urgently to develop an electronic trading platform instead. It already had an electronic platform called Automated Pit Trading (APT), which was used in after-hours trading when the trading pit was closed. LIFFE now developed a new trading platform, LIFFE CONNECT, for all trading, including the exchange&#x27;s range of short-term interest rate derivatives contracts. After the creation of the euro in 1999 the exchange won the lion&#x27;s share of trading in euro-denominated short-term interest rate derivatives â the EURIBOR contract. 

On Friday 24 November 2000, at 5Â pm, the last three of the once 26 open outcry pits were permanently closed. The design of LIFFE CONNECT made it possible for customers to choose which trading software they would use. LIFFE intended that this flexibility would encourage traders around the world to link to the exchange. And, by the beginning of 2002, customers in 25 countries around the world were trading on LIFFE. This completed a revolution in LIFFE&#x27;s business: whereas traders had once had to come to LIFFE; now, through LIFFE CONNECT, LIFFE took its market to its customers wherever they were in the world. 

Seeing LIFFE CONNECT&#x27;s potential, the Blackstone Group and Battery Ventures invested Â£44m in Liffe to finance the commercial development of the trading platform so that it could be sold to other exchanges. Liffe went on to sell the technology to three exchanges, TIFFE (now renamed the Tokyo Financial Exchange) (2001), the Chicago Board of Trade (2003) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (2008). Early in 2001 LIFFE said that it had returned to profit. In September that year the exchange announced that it had received a number of expressions of interest in buying the business. 

In January 2002, LIFFE was acquired by Euronext, joining the exchanges of Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Lisbon.

<text>Veganism involves following a vegan diet, which is a diet that includes no animal products of any kind. It can extend to ethical veganism which avoids or boycotts all products and activities whose production or undertaking is perceived to exploit animals, such as leather, silk, fur, wool, and cosmetics that have been tested on animals, as well as blood sports such as bullfighting and fox hunting.

All the people on this list are reportedly practising a vegan diet, or were at the time of their death.

<doc id="703190" wikidata="Q1364401" url="?curid=703190" title="Happy hour">
<text>Happy hour is a marketing term for a time when a venue such as a restaurant or bar offers reduced prices on alcoholic drinks. Discounted menu items like appetizers are often served during happy hour. This is a way for bars and restaurants to draw in more business before or after peak business hours.

==Origin==
The words &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;hour&quot; have appeared together for centuries when describing pleasant times. In Act I, Scene 2 of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot;, he says, &quot;Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour/That may give furtherance to our expedition...&quot; The use of the phrase &quot;happy hour&quot; to refer to a scheduled period of entertainment is, however, more recent.

One possible origin of the term &quot;happy hour,&quot; in the sense of a scheduled period of entertainment, is from the United States Navy. In early 1913, a group of homemakers called the &quot;Happy Hour Social&quot; organised &quot;semi-weekly smokers&quot; on board . The name &quot;Happy Hour Club,&quot; &quot;Happy Hour Social Club,&quot; and similar variants had been in use as the names of social clubs, primarily by women&#x27;s social clubs, since at least the early 1880s. By June 1913, the crew of &quot;Arkansas&quot; had started referring to their regularly scheduled smokers as happy hours. The happy hours included a variety of entertainment, including boxing and wrestling matches, music, dancing, and movies. By the end of World War I, the practice of holding happy hours had spread throughout the Navy.

The idea of drinking before dinner has its roots in the Prohibition era. When the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act were passed banning alcohol consumption, people would host &quot;cocktail hours&quot;, also known as &quot;happy hours&quot;, at a speakeasy before eating at restaurants where alcohol could not be served. Cocktail lounges continued the trend of drinking before dinner.

The &quot;Random House Dictionary of American Slang&quot; dates &quot;Happy hour,&quot; as a term for afternoon drinks in a bar, to a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; article on military life in 1959. The article detailed the lives of government contractors and military personnel who worked at missile-tracking facilities in the Caribbean and the Atlantic. &quot;Except for those who spend too much during &#x27;happy hour&#x27; at the bar â and there are few of these â the money mounts up fast.&quot; Barry Popick&#x27;s online etymology dictionary &quot;The Big Apple&quot; lists several pre-1959 citations to &quot;Happy Hour&quot; in print, mostly from places near naval bases in California, from as early as 1951.

==Regulations==
===Canada===
The Province of Alberta created restrictions to happy hours that took effect in August 2008. All such promotions must end at 8:00 p.m, and drink prices must conform to the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission&#x27;s minimum price regulations at all times.

In Ontario, while establishments may vary liquor prices as long as they stay above the minimum prices set by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, they are not permitted to advertise these prices &quot;in a manner that may promote immoderate consumption.&quot; Formerly, the phrase &quot;happy hour&quot; could not be used in such advertisement. That restriction was removed in 2019.

===Ireland===
Happy hour has been illegal in the Republic of Ireland since 2003, under the &quot;Intoxicating Liquor Act&quot;.

===Netherlands===
The Koninklijke Horeca Nederland (KHN), a hospitality sector lobby group, agreed with its members to stop happy hours to discourage binge drinking by youth, but only if the government would vote to not raise the minimum drinking age. In March 2013, the law to raise the drinking age to 18 was passed.

===United Kingdom===
The National Mandatory Licensing Conditions introduced in 2010 required licensees to take &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; to prevent irresponsible drinks promotions which effectively banned traditional happy hours. Under the 2014 revision to these conditions, the licensee &quot;must ensure&quot; such promotions do not take place, although there is a subjective test, that takes account of the kind of establishment and its track record, for any promotions that offer unlimited or unspecified alcohol free or for a fixed or discounted fee.

====Glasgow====
In 2004, Glasgow banned happy hours to reduce binge drinking.

===United States===

Massachusetts was the first U.S. state to implement a statewide ban on happy hours in 1984. Several other U.S. states also have similar restrictions. The reason for each ban varies, but include to prevent drunk driving, to avoid the nuisance to neighbors from loud crowds and public drunkenness, and to discourage unhealthy consumption of a large amount of alcohol in a short time.

In 1984, the U.S. military abolished happy hours at military base clubs. In 2011, the Utah State Legislature passed a ban on happy hours. In July 2011, Pennsylvania extended the period of allowable time for happy hour from two hours to four hours. In June 2012, happy hour became legal in Kansas after a 26-year ban. In July 2015, a 25-year happy hour ban was ended in Illinois.

, happy hour bans existed in Alaska, Hawaii, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, and Vermont. A bill filed in 2023 in the North Carolina General Assembly would end the state ban on happy hours but the bill is still pending. 

==For other services==

By extension, certain file-hosting websites such as RapidShare and Megaupload use the term &quot;happy hour&quot; to designate periods during which users have complimentary access to certain premium features, such as increased bandwidth, elimination of queues, and bypassing of CAPTCHA verifications.

<text>Eurobodalla Shire is a local government area located in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. The Shire is located in a largely mountainous coastal region and situated adjacent to the &quot;Tasman Sea&quot;, the Princes Highway and the Kings Highway.

The mayor of Eurobodalla Shire Council is Cr. Mathew Hatcher, an unaligned politician. 

He is also the youngest mayor, in the modern-era, ever for the Eurobodalla. The Deputy Mayor, Cllr Alison Worthington, is the first female Deputy Mayor for the Eurobodalla.

==Towns and localities==
The shire chambers are located in the town of Moruya in the central part of the Shire. Other major towns within the shire include Batemans Bay and Narooma. Smaller towns, suburbs and hamlets include:
==History==
The area which is now Eurobodalla Shire was originally the home of the South Coast Bugelli-Manji and Yuin Aboriginal peoples. The council signed a Commitment to Indigenous Australians and a Local Agreement with the Aboriginal Community.

The Eurobodalla Shire Council was formed in 1913 with the responsibility for administering local government functions along of the NSW coast between Durras and Wallaga Lake. The council administers only about 30% of the area of the Shire as the remaining 70% is non-rateable crown land held as national park and state forest: 40% of the shire is national park, 30% is state forest, 20% is productive farmland and 10% is urban settlement.

The Shire is unusual in that nearly half of ratepayers are non-residents. Just over 17% of ratepayers are residents of Canberra. Although the permanent population is around 34,100, the visiting population (who stay more than 3 nights) is 3.1 million per year.

==Heritage listings==
The Eurobodalla Shire has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Bergalia, Lakeview Homestead Complex
* Montague Island, Montague Island Light
* Moruya, Moruya and District Historical Society 85 Campbell Street: Abernethy and Co Stonemason&#x27;s Lathe
* Moruya, 13 Page Street: Moruya Mechanics&#x27; Institute

==Economy==
The main growth industries in the area are construction, government services, real estate, retail, retirement, aged care, tourism, while dairy farming, forestry, sawmilling and commercial fishing are traditional industries in decline. Eurobodalla Shire is serviced by two highways â the Princes Highway between Sydney and Melbourne (part of Highway One around Australia), and the Kings Highway (National Route 52) linking Batemans Bay to Canberra. Moruya Airport, just east of the township of Moruya, is serviced by regular scheduled commuter flights to Sydney and Melbourne. There are no railways or major seaports in Eurobodalla Shire.

<text>Nova 96.9 (call sign: 2SYD) is a commercial radio station operating in Sydney, Australia.

The station is owned by NOVA Entertainment along with sister station, smoothfm 95.3

==Audience==
In 2014 Nova had a 4% share of the Sydney audience on average, which is en par with rival ABC FM. &quot;Kate, Tim &amp; Marty&quot; was the highest rated Nova show receiving 2.9% of Sydney&#x27;s Drive time audience. Smallzy&#x27;s Surgery receives a 0.5% share for the nighttime slot and Fitzy &amp; Wippa received an 0.9% of Sydney&#x27;s Breakfast audience.

In November 2014, Nova held a 0.7% for breakfast and 2.6% share for drive time.

==History==
One of the driving forces behind the creation of Nova was the growing demographic of youth who were embracing the commercialised anti-pop movement fronted by such artists as Daft Punk and Spiderbait, but for whom Triple J, operated by the publicly funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation, had no commercial incentives to offer. Initially the music selection on Nova 96.9 was very similar to that of Triple J, and a number of the station presenters, most notably former breakfast hosts Merrick and Rosso, which were also former Triple J staff. However, while Triple J has retained its alternative style, Nova has drifted towards a more commercial format. Meanwhile, other stations have adopted Nova&#x27;s more varied programming style, to the point where Nova is now hard to tell apart from other commercial FM stations.

Along with its sister stations Nova 100 Melbourne, Nova 106.9 Brisbane, Nova 91.9 Adelaide and Nova 93.7 Perth, Nova claims to be Australia&#x27;s leading brand in the Women of the 45-54 Age demographic.

Nova 96.9 are major sponsors of A-League club Sydney FC and Australian Football League (AFL) club the Greater Western Sydney Giants.

<text>Otto Gerhard Waalkes (born 22 July 1948), also known as simply Otto, is a German comedian, actor, musician, writer, and comic book artist. He became famous in the 1970s and 1980s in Germany with his shows, books and films. His best known trademark are the &#x27;Ottifanten&#x27; (&#x27;Ottiphants&#x27;), elephant-like comic characters of his own design. They featured on the cover of his first album release.

Waalkes also works as a voice actor, providing the German voices of Mushu in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan&quot;, Sid the Sloth in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise, and the Grinch in &quot;The Grinch&quot;, among others.

== Life ==
Waalkes was born as the second son of Karl Waalkes, a painter and decorator, and his wife Adele (born LÃ¼pkes). Together with his older brother Karl-Heinz, he grew up in the working-class district &quot;Transvaal&quot; in Emden (East Frisia). His parents were deeply religious Baptists and members of the Evangelic Free Church community of Emden, which taught a Bible-class that Waalkes visited regularly. He made his first public performance at the age of eleven years in a shopping mall in Emden, where he presented songs, including the &quot;Babysitter Boogie&quot;, a German version of the &quot;Baby Sittin&#x27; Boogie&quot;. He was awarded with a voucher of 30 Deutschmark and the book &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;. When Waalkes was twelve years old, he received his first guitar. In 1964, he performed for the first time in the area of Emden with his band &quot;The Rustlers&quot;, mainly covering songs by the Beatles. Waalkes was the front of the band, being the lead singer and the lead guitarist simultaneously. He toured with his band in the regions of East Frisia for five years.

In 1968, Waalkes passed his final exams (Abitur) at a boys&#x27; grammar school in Emden. After having failed to obtain a university place in &quot;Freie Malerei&quot; (&quot;free art studies&quot;), he started to study art education at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg in 1970, although he never pursued a teaching profession. Among others, he was taught by Hans Thiemann, a German painter.

Waalkes&#x27; first stage performance took place in &quot;Danny&#x27;s Pan&quot;, a folklore club in Hamburg where people could perform for ten minutes after having paid five Deutschmark. He lived in a commune named &quot;Villa Kunterbunt&quot; (German for Villa Villekulla) together with 14 roommates in Hamburg. Two of his roommates were Udo Lindenberg and Marius MÃ¼ller-Westernhagen.

Waalkes kept performing smaller gigs with his guitar in clubs of Hamburg to finance his studies. He cracked some jokes alongside to his songs and apologized whenever he accidentally dropped the microphone due to his nervousness. Over time, his apologies became more popular than his music, so his comedic stage show started to evolve. The clubs where he performed became gradually bigger â suddenly they were not merely named Onkel PÃ¶ but Westfalenhalle.

In 1972, Waalkes met his later manager Hans Otto Mertens. In the same year, he performed his first big concert with his band The Rustlers in Hamburg, which he recorded live at his own charge. He also founded the label &quot;RÃ¼ssl RÃ¤ckords&quot; with Mertens, because no other record label wanted to publish the live records of Waalkes&#x27; performance. His album &quot;LP Otto&quot; was published in the same year and was sold over 500,000 times.

Waalkes is a survivor of the MGM Grand Fire on 21 November 1980. He was residing on the 26th floor during the accident and was evacuated by firefighters during the rescue efforts.

Waalkes was married to Manuela &quot;Manu&quot; (born Ebelt) from 1987 to 1999. In 1987, his son Benjamin Karl Otto Gregory was born.

In 2000, Waalkes married in Jork, an actress born in 1972. According to their own statement, they had an open marriage and often lived in different places.

The couple officially split in early November 2011 and got divorced on 22 November 2012.

Waalkes lives in Hamburg-Blankenese and is officially registered as a constituent of Hamburg.

In 2023, German rapper Ski Aggu and Dutch musician Joost Klein created an edit of Waalkes&#x27; song &#x27;Friesenjung&#x27; from 1993. The edit reached the first position of the German Singles Chart.

== Career ==

Waalkes&#x27; humor consists of puns and word plays as well as the use of silly and funny language, noises and body language. Parodies, for instance in form of popular songs that he revises and presents with his guitar, are typical stylistic elements. Additionally, he often imbeds satire, political innuendos and critique of time and society into his humorous performances.

His &quot;Otto-BÃ¼cher&quot; (Otto-books) are regularly published and his &quot;Otto-Langspielplatten&quot; (Otto-long-playing records) became bestsellers, whereby many records attained top spots in musical charts and shops.

Waalkes is counted among the entertainers that have influenced the general use of language. A considerable part of this refers back to his early performances, where he mainly used texts of the New Frankfurt School. For example, the sentence &quot;Hast du mal &#x27;ne Zigarette? Meine Schachtel steckt noch im Automaten!&quot; (&quot;Do you have a cigarette? My pack is still in the machine!&quot;) was firstly introduced by Waalkes. The set phrase &quot;Einen hab&#x27; ich noch!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve got another one for you!&quot;) introducing the next joke is often ascribed to him, however, it was firstly introduced by Heinz Erhardt, as many of Waalkes&#x27; set phrases are.

Waalkes played roles that became famous on their own, for example the reporter &quot;Harry Hirsch&quot;, &quot;Frau Suhrbier&quot; and the senior forestry official &quot;OberfÃ¶rster Pudlich&quot;, as well as Herbert von Karamalz, who portrays a parody of Herbert von Karajan and a nod to a German brand of Malt beer. 

Waalkes&#x27; most famous comic character is the &quot;Ottifant&quot; (&#x27;Ottiphant&#x27;), which he drew originally only for the cover of a record. Over time, the stick-figure developed into a distinct cartoon character with its own family. Their adventures and stories were published in several newspapers and books. Furthermore, a cartoon series, consisting of 13 episodes, depicted the Ottifanten on RTL and Super RTL in 1993. An animated cinema movie named &quot;Kommando StÃ¶rtebeker&quot; portrayed the Ottifanten.

Besides his stage performances, Waalkes has appeared several times on camera as an actor or off camera as a director. His movies are parodies of current events within the scope of culture and public life and are characterized by situation comedy and caricatured individuals.

In 2018, Waalkes was awarded with the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his lifework.

In June 2021, a German film version of &quot;Catweazle&quot; was released with Waalkes in the title role.

The original station was built by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837, and so the station is the oldest one on its original site in the city, and one of the oldest continuously operated station sites in the world. The Grand Junction became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), thence the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and each owned the station in turn. Together with the rest of Britain&#x27;s railways it was nationalised in 1948.

=== 1960s redevelopment ===

The station was rebuilt when the line was electrified in 1966 as part of the London Midland Region&#x27;s electrification programme. The actual energization of the line from Coventry to Walsall through Aston took place on 15 August 1966.

=== 2020s redevelopment ===
In 2019, the West Midlands Rail Executive and Transport for West Midlands put forward proposals to redevelop Perry Barr station, along with a new bus interchange, in time for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Proposed designs were revealed in September 2020. Further revisions were proposed in December. The designs were approved and the station was closed on 10 May 2021 for redevelopment, with the station reopened on 29 May 2022. The new building has a bronze-coloured frieze depicting athletes.

== Features ==

The pedestrian entrance is on the A34 Walsall Road. The station has two side platforms, one each side of the two operating lines, with no points or sidings. The ticket office is on a bridge over the tracks, which are below street level. Both platforms have step-free access, lifts replacing the former ramps. It is staffed on a part-time basis throughout the week, and has a self-service ticket and Permit to Travel machine for use when the ticket office is closed. Waiting shelters and bench seating are provided at platform level, along with customer help points. Service information is given on information displays and by automated announcements.

As well as local residents, shops and businesses, it serves:
*Alexander Stadium
*Perry Barr Stadium
*Perry Hall Park
*a number of bus services, including the Outer Circle

==Services==
The typical daytime service on weekdays and Saturdays has two trains per hour in each direction between and (and onwards to via the Stour Valley Line) that are operated by EMUs. Services are reduced to hourly on Sundays. There are a small number of services that extend past to . On Mondays to Saturdays one early morning train starts from Rugeley Trent Valley.

The line also sees occasional use for diverted passenger trains between Birmingham New Street and Wolverhampton (and destinations further north), usually when the Stour Valley Line is closed for engineering work.

== Incidents ==

* On 22 December 1859 one passenger jumped from a Walsall to Birmingham train and was killed, and others were injured, due to the train, using South Staffordshire Railway rolling stock, being derailed by one of its carriages shedding a tyre.
* On 22 December 1895, Mark Robins, a LNWR guard, was killed while his goods train was waiting in a siding at the station for a faster football excursion train from Liverpool to Birmingham to pass. Due to fog, he did not see the approaching train, and was struck by it.

<text>The Moscow Conservatory, also officially Tchaikovsky Moscow State Conservatory () is a higher musical educational institution located in Moscow, Russia. It grants undergraduate and graduate degrees in musical performance and musical research. The conservatory offers various degrees including Bachelor of Music Performance, Master of Music and PhD in research.

==History==
===Background===
In 1766, the future site of the conservatory was bought by Princess Ekaterina Romanovna Dashkova (1743-1810), later president of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy. The building was completed in the 1790s. Its author was Vasily Bazhenov, the design of the building was corrected by the hostess herself. Toward the end of her life, she spent winters here.

In 1810, the building was inherited by her nephew, Count Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, a future war hero, participant in the Battle of Borodino, then governor of Novorossiya and Bessarabia, governor of the Caucasus. He was renting out the house. The house burned in 1812, rebuilt by 1824.

===Establishment of a conservatory===
The idea of establishing a conservatory in Moscow was first suggested in 1819 by Friedrich Scholz, Kapellmeister of the Bolshoi Theater, but the idea was not supported. Eleven years later, in 1830, he managed to get permission to open at his home &quot;free teaching of figured bass and composition&quot;. In 1860, Nikolai Rubinstein, together with Vasily Kologrivov, organized in Moscow musical classes of the Moscow branch of the Imperial Russian Musical Society. Rubinstein&#x27;s co-founder was Prince Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy, chairman of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society (1863-1876). Initially, the music classes were held in Rubinstein&#x27;s apartment (who lived on Sadovaya Street, in Volotsky&#x27;s house). First of all, classes in choral singing (Konstantin Albrecht) and elementary music theory (Eduard Langer, then Nikolai Rubinstein and Nikolay Kashkin) were organized. Since the fall of 1863, most of the classes moved to the new address of Rubinstein&#x27;s residence (Myasnoy alley, house of Burkin). Solo singing (Bertha Walzek and Adolf Osberg) and playing various instruments began to be taught: violin (Karl Klamroth and Vasily Bezekirsky), piano (Nikolai Rubinstein, Eduard Langer and Nikolay Kashkin), cello (Karl Ezef), flute (Ferdinand BÃ¼chner), trumpet (Fyodor Richter). In 1864 the number of pupils exceeded two hundred, and the Russian Musical Society rented Voeikova&#x27;s house on Mokhovaya Street, where Rubinstein&#x27;s apartment was located. In 1866, teachers Ludwig Minkus (violin), JÃ³zef Wieniawski and Anton Door (piano), and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (elementary music theory) joined.

In 1862, a conservatory was established in Saint Petersburg, and there was a need for a higher musical institution in Moscow. The report of the Russian Musical Society for 1863/1864 already mentioned a concert organized &quot;for the benefit of the conservatory to be opened in Moscow&quot;

Conservatory in Moscow was co-founded in 1866 as the Moscow Imperial Conservatory by Nikolai Rubinstein and Prince Nikolai Troubetzkoy. The grand opening was held on 1 September. It is the second oldest conservatory in Russia after the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was appointed professor of theory and harmony at its opening. Since 1940, the centenary of his birth, the conservatory has borne his name.

===Conservatory===
The highest permission for the opening of the Moscow Conservatory, at the request of the August Patroness of the Society, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, followed on 24 December 1865. Pianist N.G. Rubinstein was approved as its director on 6 February 1866. Konstantin Albrecht was appointed inspector of the conservatory. By the day of the opening of the Conservatory a house was rented at the corner of Vozdvizhenka and the Arbatskie Gates passage, in the house of Baroness Cherkasova. The house has not survived; in 1941, during an air raid on Moscow, the building was destroyed by a bomb. In 1871 the Moscow Conservatory rented Dashkova&#x27;s house, and in 1878 bought it for 185 thousand rubles.

The Conservatory was financed by the income of the Russian Musical Society from concert activities, as well as city and government subsidies, donations from private individuals and tuition fees. The course of study at the conservatory took six years until 1879, then was increased to nine years. It covered both music classes (instrumental, vocal, orchestral, choral, opera, and theory) and general education. Until 1917, tuition was paid.

In the early years of the Conservatory, the level of requirements for admission to the Conservatory was by necessity very low. Only those who had studied earlier in the Music Society classes had some theoretical training. All others were required to begin music theory with an elementary course, in which everyone was enrolled regardless of proficiency in any instrument, mainly piano. In the first school year of 1866/1867, the professorial (senior) classes had 38 pupils on the piano; the junior classes (adjunct classes) had 43. In May 1867, general examinations were held, on the basis of which the students were assigned to courses.

In the early years of its activity the Conservatory was taught by professors: piano - Nikolai Rubinstein, JÃ³zef Wieniawski, C. F. Wilshau (adjunct), Anton Door, C. E. Weber (adjunct), Alexandre Dubuque, A. K. Zander (adjunct), Karl Klindworth (from 1868), Nikolay Kashkin, E. L. Langer (adjunct), L. F. Langer (from 1869), Nikolai Zverev (junior piano classes from 1870); solo singing - A. D. Alexandrova-Kochetova, B. O. Walzek, Vladimir Kashperov, A. R. Osberg, J. Galvani (from 1869); violin - Ferdinand Laub, Ludwig Minkus, Jan HÅÃ­malÃ½ (from 1869 - adjunct, from 1874 - professor), G. Shradik (adjunct); cello - B. Kosman, Wilhelm Fitzenhagen (from 1870); double bass - G. F. Spekin; flute - F. F. BÃ¼chner; oboe - E. F. Meder; clarinet - W. Guth; French horn - M. Barthold, trumpet - F. B. Richter, bassoon - K. F. Ezer; history and theory of church singing in Russia - D. V. Razumovsky; music-theoretical subjects - Konstantin Albrecht, N. A. Hubert, Nikolay Kashkin, E. L. Langer, Herman Laroche, A. S. Razmadze; elementary music theory and harmony - Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (since 1870 - instrumentation and free composition).

In 1899 the Italian singer, composer and teacher U. A. Masetti was invited, who raised solo singing to the highest level, creatively combining the best of the Italian and Russian schools.

The building rented for the conservatory soon became insufficient due to the ever-increasing number of students. In the summer of 1877, Prince M. S. Vorontsov&#x27;s house on Nikitskaya Street was finally acquired by the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society. This building met the educational needs of the Conservatory for fifteen years, but by the end of this period it had become cramped again, as the number of students had increased considerably (in the 1868-1869 school year there were 184 students, and in 1893-1894 there were already 430). In addition, the need for its own concert hall began to be felt. However, the old building was mortgaged to the Moscow City Credit Society, and a number of proposals were considered for the purchase of various plots of land in Moscow for construction. On 27 November 1893 it was decided to build a conservatory designed by academician of architecture V. P. Zagorsky on the site of Prince Vorontsov&#x27;s house. In 1894, after the transfer of the Conservatory to temporary hired premises in the house of Prince Golitsyn on Volkhonka, the dismantling of the old building began, and on 27 June 1895 the solemn laying of the new building of the Conservatory took place. In 1898 the Conservatory already began its classes in new classrooms, and on October 25 of the same year the Small Hall was consecrated and opened. Works on the arrangement and decoration of the Great Hall were finished only by 1901, and on 7 April 1901 the grand opening of the hall took place.

In 1932-1933, the three-storey building was built on the project of I. Y. Bondarenko. In 1983, the building of the Synodal School of Church Singing (former Kolychevy House, in the style of classicism, built in the late 18th century by an unknown architect of the school M. F. Kazakov; since 1925 it housed the law faculty of Moscow State University) was added to the conservatory, which was granted the status of the third academic building of the conservatory.

During the Soviet period, the Sunday Working Conservatory (1927-1933) and the Music Work Faculty (1929-1935) were organized to prepare the children of workers and peasants for admission to the Moscow Conservatory. For the admission of representatives of the Union republics extra-competitive (target) places were allocated annually. In 1931-1932, solving the Â«task of proletarianisationÂ», Narkompros decided to rename the Moscow Conservatory into Â«Feliks Kon Higher Music SchoolÂ». In these years, attempts were made to simplify the curricula, Â«to bring them into agreement with the Marxist methodÂ». In late 1932, the former name and academic profile of the institution were restored.

In 1935, the Military Conductor&#x27;s Faculty was established on the basis of the Military Kapellmeister&#x27;s Department of the Conservatory. As of 22 June 1941, there were 30 students in the military faculty. In the 2000s, this faculty was transferred from the subordination of the Moscow Conservatory to the subordination of the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, and then to the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.

On 7 May 1940, by the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Moscow Conservatory was named after P. I. Tchaikovsky and scholarships named after P. I. Tchaikovsky were established for especially gifted students of the Faculty of Composition.

In 1954 a monument to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was unveiled in front of the Great Hall of the Conservatory.

On 18 March 1958 the First International Tchaikovsky Competition was opened at the Conservatory. Until 2019, in the years of this competition, the Conservatory&#x27;s curricula were cut by one month for the comfortable preparation of participants and jury members: usually the main wave of the summer session took place from May 20 to the end of June, but in the years of the competition - from the end of April to June 5.

==Choral faculty==
Prior to the October Revolution, the choral faculty of the conservatory was second to the Moscow Synodal School and Moscow Synodal Choir, but in 1919, both were closed and merged into the choral faculty. Some of the students now listed as being of the conservatory were in fact students of the Synodal School.

<text>West Midlands Bus route 11, also known as the Birmingham Outer Circle, is a route that circumnavigates Birmingham via the A4040 apart from a small deviation via the B4182 and A4030 in Bearwood. It is operated by National Express West Midlands. It operated in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions as routes 11C and 11A, however since July 2021 the service was split so 11A buses would terminate at Perry Barr and then return as an 11C to Acocks Green, with 11C buses terminating at Erdington, returning as a 11A service to Acocks Green.

The route is operated by National Express West Midlands. Since bus deregulation in 1986, several companies have competed on sections of this route. Falcon Travel, Serverse Travel, Birmingham Motor Traction, AM PM Travel, Joe&#x27;s Travel, GRS Travel and Discount Travel Solutions have traversed the entire route.

==History==

Route 11 was Europe&#x27;s longest urban bus route after Coventry&#x27;s route 360 until it was withdrawn in 2016. It first came into existence as two routes in 1923: route 10 ran from King&#x27;s Heath to the King&#x27;s Head (Hagley Road) via Cotteridge, and route 11 from Six Ways Erdington to Acocks Green and Moseley. The route was first operated as a complete circuit on 26 April 1926, the idea being to better link the suburbs of Birmingham, as most routes at that time travelled in and out of the city 

The route was operated by Birmingham City Transport until the formation of West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) on 1 October 1969. In 1986, WMPTE&#x27;s bus operations were taken over by West Midlands Travel who now operate as National Express West Midlands.

The route is traversed annually by a cavalcade of vintage buses. Run by the Aston Manor Road Transport Museum, the event began in 1977 and has continued each year since with the exception of 2000, in which it was cancelled due to a national fuel shortage.

The route was upgraded in 2004 by Centro. Over Â£25 million was spent on CCTV coverage, bus priority measures, new shelters with electronic information displays and new low-floor buses.

AM PM Travel began operating on the service in October 2009, increasing the frequency of their route in December. Six re-furbished Volvo Olympians entered onto the new service fitted with Wi-Fi technology. AM PM Travel later ceased operating.

The 11A was one of the routes chosen for service extras when National Express West Midlands withdrew their MCW Metrobus vehicles on 24 July 2010.

In 2012 Joe&#x27;s Travel began operating on the service using step entrance Dennis Darts, but withdrew its services on 20 May 2014.

In September 2014, GRS Travel began operating the service with two buses on route 11C and two on route 11A. However, in July 2015 they ceased operation following a Public Inquiry.

In March 2015, Social Travel commenced operating eight weekday services a day on route 11C. In April 2018 this was reduced to just four weekday services a day on route 11C.

In April 2017, Discount Travel Solutions commenced operating eight weekday services a day on route 11A, later launching on route 11C. Discount Travel ceased operation in July 2022.

The route was temporarily split into two in July 2021 owing to road works. Some media interpreted it as being a permanent end of the route.

==Route==
A full circuit can take up to three hours to complete, with the service carrying 50,000 passengers each day. There are 266 bus stops on the route. The route serves 233 schools, colleges or universities, 69 leisure and community facilities, 40 pubs, 19 retail centres, six hospitals, and one prison. It also links some 15 commercial centres, and passes Cadbury&#x27;s in Bournville, one of the world&#x27;s largest chocolate factories.

The outer circle is the traditional route for the Free Radio Birmingham Walkathon, a sponsored walk which raises funds for charity.

Route 11 operates with an off-peak weekday frequency in each direction.

As a temporary measure introduced on Sunday 4 July 2021, the service was split in two due to lengthy delays caused by roadworks at Perry Barr.

==In popular culture==
The Birmingham band Woodbine&#x27;s eponymous 1999 album features the track &quot;Outer Circle&quot;, a tribute to the bus route. In 2001 a group of musicians from Birmingham created a concert based on the route.

On 11 November 2008, (starting at 11:00), humourist Jon Bounds spent eleven hours travelling the route, documenting his journey online, using Twitter, Facebook and a blog, elevenbus.co.uk.

In October 2009 Kevin Beresford, a 57-year-old resident of Birmingham, created a calendar dedicated to the anti-clockwise portion of the route.

The Outer Circle has also been the inspiration for a Scottish Country Dance. Devised by Kenneth Reid from the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society&#x27;s Birmingham Branch, it is regularly featured on dance programmes all over the world. The 48 bar reel represents the circuit of route 11, with the diagonal corner chain formations inside, and the travelling couple outside of the set highlighting the fluctuation speed and congestion within the route.

The route has also been the inspiration for a collection of short stories, written by Birmingham-based writers and edited by Jay Barton.

<doc id="703235" wikidata="Q670320" url="?curid=703235" title="John Wall (priest and martyr)">
<text>John Wall, &quot;(aliases John Marsh, Francis Johnson or Dormore or Webb, religious name &quot;Joachim of St. Ann&quot;)&quot; (1620 â 22 August 1679) was an English Franciscan friar, who is honoured as a martyr by the Catholic Church. Wall served on the English mission in Worcestershire for twenty-two years before being arrested and executed at the time of Titus Oates&#x27;s alleged plot.

==Life==
He was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of wealthy and staunch Lancashire Catholics. His brother William, also a priest, became a Benedictine monk. William was later arrested, and condemned for being a priest, but was reprieved and survived. John Wall was sent when very young to be educated at the English College, Douai. As the English government had spies and informers on the continent, Wall used the name &quot;John Marsh&quot;.

He entered the English College, Rome, on 5 November 1641 and was ordained a Catholic priest on 3 December 1645. He was sent on the English Mission on 12 May 1648 under the aliases of Francis Johnson, and Dormore. For several years he said Mass for recusant households. He returned to Douai and on 1 January 1651, he joined the Order of Friars Minor at St. Bonaventure&#x27;s Friary, taking the name Friar Joachim of St. Ann. He was soon named Master of novices, serving in that office until 1656, when he returned to England, under the name Francis Webb and settled in Worcestershire. There he became a Governor (Six Master) of the Royal Grammar School Worcester.

After 22 years of ministry to the Catholics of the area, he was apprehended in December 1678, at Rushock Court near Bromsgrove, where the sheriff&#x27;s man had come to seek a debtor. He was tendered the Oath of Supremacy and was committed to Worcester Gaol for refusing it. His trial was on 25 April 1679. A man whose vices he had reproved bore testimony to his priesthood, and he received a sentence.

He was then sent to London, and four times examined by Oates, Bedloe, and others in the hope of implicating him in the pretended plot; but was declared innocent of all plotting and offered his life if he would abjure his religion. He was brought back to Worcester and executed on Red Hill 22 August 1679. Wall was a much respected local figure and the crowd&#x27;s reaction showed that their sympathies were entirely with him. Many of the onlookers, who were mostly Protestants, wept, and the Sheriff reportedly cried out &quot;Will this end Popery? This is the way to make us all Papists!&quot;

He was an outstanding academic, perhaps the most intellectually distinguished English Catholic priest of his generation.

==Veneration==
His quartered body was given to his friends and was buried in the cemetery adjoining the Church of St. Oswald of Worcester, while the head was taken to the Franciscan friary of Douai, to which the martyr belonged.

Previously, his feast day was observed within the Franciscan Order on the date of his death, 22 August. It has been moved and is currently observed on 12 July, a date he shares with his brother friar and fellow martyr, John Jones. In the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham, his feast day is celebrated on 23 August. St John Wall Catholic School in Birmingham is named after him.

Underwood&#x27;s rugby talent was first nurtured at Barnard Castle School. Upon leaving he was educated at Leicester University and St Edmund&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied from 1990 to 1992 and won a blue whilst a member of Cambridge University R.U.F.C.

Following his elder brother Rory, he played for Leicester Tigers and England. Tony had another brother called Gary, who played at under-21 level for England. He made his England debut in October 1992 against Canada, and went on to win a total of 27 English caps. Tony and Rory were the first brothers to play for England together since Harold and Arthur Wheatley in England&#x27;s 1937 6â3 win over Scotland, and partnered in the 1995 Five Nations Grand Slam win.

He played in the Rugby World Cup in 1995, and in the Quarter final match against Australia he scored a try that many regard as one of the finest in running Rugby, with his right-wing counterpart Damien Smith failing to tackle him, and that helped England to reach the Semi-finals. In the Semi-final he had another memorable moment in which his opposite number, Jonah Lomu, ran a ring around him, before powering straight over the tackle of full back Mike Catt to score what would be one of his four tries in that game. In 1995, he left Leicester for Newcastle Falcons. At Newcastle he made 11 appearances as they won the 1997-98 Premiership. His last cap for England came in December 1998 against South Africa where he was replaced early; England went on to win. He would later feature in a Pizza Hut advertising campaign alongside Lomu.

==Post rugby==
He is now retired from international rugby and having trained as a pilot, went on to fly for EasyJet. He then became a long-haul pilot for Virgin Atlantic. He was seen on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Airline&quot; training to be a pilot, graduating, and completing his first flight with easyJet from London Luton Airport to Zurich. He used to live in Monkston, Milton Keynes. He lived in Dubai, where he flew the Airbus A380 as a captain for Emirates. He is married, with two children.

<text>Alexandros Koryzis (; 1885 â 18 April 1941) was a Greek politician who served briefly as the prime minister of Greece in 1941.

==Career==
Koryzis assumed this role on 29 January 1941, when his predecessor, the dictator Ioannis Metaxas died of throat cancer, during the Greco-Italian War. Prior to this, Koryzis had been governor of the Bank of Greece.

Koryzis was born on the small island of Poros in Greece, where a museum dedicated to his life and contribution exists today.

Prime Minister Metaxas had declined British offers of direct military assistance on the grounds that this could be used as a justification for German intervention in support of their Italian allies. Koryzis however agreed to the dispatch of &quot;W Force&quot; - a British and Dominion force of two infantry divisions and an armoured brigade. 

Although largely powerless, as the government was effectively controlled by King George II, Koryzis still bore the burden of the German invasion which commenced on 6 April of the same year. Less than two weeks later, on 18 April, as German troops marched towards Athens and the city was placed under martial law, he shot himself. According to Theodore Stephanides, who was in Crete at the time, newspapers initially reported that the cause of his death was a heart attack, probably to avoid causing mass panic in Athens.

<text>Otto Joachim (October 13, 1910 â July 30, 2010) was a German-born Canadian violist and composer of electronic music.

==Early life and education==

Joachim was born in DÃ¼sseldorf, Joachim to Jewish parents. His father was an opera singer. He trained as a violinist at DÃ¼sseldorf and at the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne.

==Career==
In 1934 Joachim left Nazi Germany (as did many Jewish composers of his time). He played in Singapore and Shanghai during the war years, opened a radio shop, and experimented with electronic instruments and accessories. He also performed occasionally in the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra and organized an orchestra to perform Jewish and other Western music.

Joachim left Shanghai at the time of the Communist takeover of China, and settled permanently in Montreal in 1949. For the next 15 years Joachim worked as a player, teacher, instrument builder and composer. He played in the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, and beginning in 1956 taught violin and viola at both the McGill Conservatory and at the Conservatoire de musique du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al.

In the 1950s Joachim experimented with twelve-tone music, and in 1956 composed &quot;String Quartet&quot;, an instrumental piece which combined twelve tone music with more traditional classical techniques. In 1958 he founded the Montreal Consort of Ancient Instruments, and directed it for ten years.

Since the 1960s he has concentrated on his compositions which are a mix of aleatoric and electroacoustic works. He composed a multi-channel electroacoustic work for the Canadian Pavilion, Katimavik at Expo 67 in Montreal. It was in the late-1970s that Joachim took up painting and sculpture. In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University, Montreal. The multi-channel electroacoustic studio in the Department of Music at Concordia University is named &quot;The Otto Joachim Project Studio&quot;, where one of his paintings hangs.

In 1986 he was named an Honorary Member of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community, and in 1993, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

In 2007 Joachim was presented with an Opus Tribute Award by the Conseil quÃ©bÃ©cois de la musique. He died on July 30, 2010, in Montreal.

<text>Pierre Ossian Bonnet (; 22 December 1819, Montpellier â 22 June 1892, Paris) was a French mathematician. He made some important contributions to the differential geometry of surfaces, including the GaussâBonnet theorem.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Pierre Bonnet attended the CollÃ¨ge in Montpellier. In 1838 he entered the Ãcole Polytechnique in Paris. He also studied at the Ãcole Nationale des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es.

===Middle years===
In graduating he was offered a post as an engineer. After some thought Bonnet decided on a career in teaching and research in mathematics instead.

Turning down the engineering post had not been an easy decision since Bonnet was not well off financially. He had to do private tutoring so that he could afford to accept a position at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1844.

One year before this, in 1843, Bonnet had written a paper on the convergence of series with positive terms. Another paper on series in 1849 was to earn him an award from the Brussels Academy. However between these two papers on series, Bonnet had begun his work on differential geometry in 1844.

Bonnet was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1862 to replace Biot. He defeated Bour for this position. From 1868 Bonnet assisted Chasles at the Ecole Polytechnique, and three years later he became a director of studies there. In addition to this post he also taught at the Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure.

In 1878 Bonnet succeeded Le Verrier to the chair at the Sorbonne, then in 1883 he succeeded Liouville as a member of the Bureau des Longitudes.

Bonnet did important work on differential geometry, a topic that was also being investigated in France by Serret, Frenet, Bertrand and Puiseux. Here Bonnet made major contributions to the concept of curvature. In particular, he published a formula relating the surface integral of the Gauss curvature to the Euler characteristic of the surface and the line integral of the geodesic curvature of its boundary; this result is now known as the GaussâBonnet theorem. Gauss was known to have previously discovered a special case of this fundamental result, but had never published it.

Independently of Ferdinand Minding, Bonnet showed the invariance of the Gauss curvature of a surface under bending. Between 1844 and 1867 he published a series of papers on the differential geometry of surfaces. In 1859 he submitted an important memoir for the Grand Prize of the Paris Academy. In modern terminology, the prize was offered for determining all possible local isometric embeddings in Euclidean 3-space of a surface with given Riemannian metric (&quot;line element&quot;).

<text>Cristian Alexanda is an Australian R&amp;B singer from Perth. In 2003 and 2004, he has supported a number of well-known acts on their Australian tours including 50 Cent, G-Unit and Sean Paul and Justin Timberlake.

==Life and career==

===2004â2007: Cristyle===
His first single &quot;Misunderstood&quot; was released on 24 May 2004. It peaked at 24 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Misunderstood&#x27; was a very popular club and radio anthem in Australia and was certified gold in 2005. The song was taken from his debut album &quot;Cristyle&quot; produced by The Ignorants and Blacksmith, who had also produced tracks for Blue and Craig David. 

The second single &quot;Party Anthem&quot; was released in July 2004 and debuted at number 19.

Alexanda said in later interviews for his second album, &quot;Urban Nature&quot;, that his party lifestyle while writing and recording his 1st album made him draw inspiration from other places inside of him. &quot;Cristyle&quot; was released in early 2005 but had minimal promotion due to a rift between his management label, Legit Music, and marketing/distribution giant Liberation / Mushroom Music. Label owner Michael Gudinski, known for discovering Kylie Minogue and furthering the career of Jimmy Barnes, has said Alexanda is one of the most talented and energetic young performers he&#x27;s seen in recent years. Music media giant Molly Meldrum has also had high praises for Alexanda, saying that his album, Cristyle was the best album released in summer 2004/2005. Later that year in June, he supported Justin Timberlake on the Australian leg of the Justified &amp; Stripped Tour. The second single was &quot;Party Anthem&quot;.

===2007â2009: Urban Nature===
Cristian spent majority of 2007â2008 recording his third album both in Australia and the United States. All songs for the album were written by Alexanda, now Alexander, and produced by the most popular producers in Australia. The album features collaborations from U.S rapper/actor Ja Rule, who made his first rap appearance in years after retiring to pursue acting. The song &quot;Too Fine&quot; featuring Ja Rule, was realised in April 2008 The album also features U.S platinum rapper Fabolous on &quot;Something About You&quot;. It was never released as a single due to a meltdown at Fabolous&#x27;s record label Def Jam, and no video was produced for it. The second single &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; was highly praised by the Australian music media. Due to a company fold from Central Station Records going bankrupt, the album&#x27;s distributor, &quot;Won&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; and &quot;Stay With Me&quot; were rush as single releases with no promotion. The album was never physically released and is only available on iTunes and in stores in Japan. Alexander quickly moved on to his next project &quot;Revolution&quot; recorded for Zhenya Records.

===2009âpresent: Later career===
In 2010, Cristian moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to write and co-produce an album for Asian musician Siti Nurhaliza. It was her first ever English album. Cristian wrote and produced the album with past collaborator Bryan B (&quot;Urban Nature&quot;). Cristian also wrote the collaboration with Sean Kingston on the song titled &quot;Remember You&quot;. As the album was set to be released, Cristian abruptly left the record company Whats Up Entertainment citing creative differences with the company heads. He then quickly moved on to his next project, another solo album called &quot;Born Again Cristian&quot;. The meaning behind the album is a rebirth of the artist after he told Malaysian interviewers the music is like nothing he&#x27;s heard before.

<text>William John Heaton Greenwood, MBE (born 20 October 1972) is an English former rugby union player who played for Leicester Tigers and Harlequins and was a member of England&#x27;s 2003 World Cup-winning team and the 1997 British &amp; Irish Lions. He played in the centre, mainly as an inside centre.

He is the son of Dick Greenwood, who was a former England coach.

==Early life==
Born 20 October 1972 in Blackburn, Lancashire, Greenwood was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Hall and Sedbergh School. As a schoolboy, he was also a talented cricketer and played for the Lancashire Schools representative team before ultimately deciding to concentrate on rugby. He graduated with a BA in economics from Durham University in 1994. He then worked as a trader at a bank in London.

==Career==
===Club===
Greenwood played club rugby for Preston Grasshoppers, Waterloo, Harlequins and Leicester Tigers.

He left Harlequins and moved to Leicester Tigers in 1996 because the presence of England centre Will Carling meant he could not get first team rugby.

In 2000 he moved back to Harlequins after succumbing to poor form, not helped by the arrival of Australian Pat Howard that prevented him from getting first team rugby. His match-winning try to defeat Brive, in the European Shield quarterfinal on 27 January 2001, was voted the club&#x27;s 2000/01 &#x27;Try of the Year&#x27;. He had already picked up an RFU Cup winner&#x27;s medal with Leicester but tasted defeat in the final of the same competition with NEC Harlequins, at the hands of Newcastle Falcons in 2001.

Greenwood extended his contract with Harlequins when they were relegated to the National League 1. He retired at the end of the 2005/06 season after helping them regain promotion.

===International===
He was selected for the British &amp; Irish Lions&#x27; tour to South Africa still uncapped, and ahead of then England captain Phil de Glanville, in the summer of 1997. During the tour, he was injured on the pitch after a collision and stopped breathing for several minutes, and did not play in any of the test matches.

He made his England debut in 1997. He became an important part of the England team, establishing a centre partnership with Jeremy Guscott. He later cemented his place in the England team for the Six Nations and World Cup in 2003. He formed a centre partnership with Mike Tindall or Mike Catt and wore the number 13 even if he played inside centre. He was involved in all but one of England&#x27;s games in the World Cup. Although he had rushed home due to his wife&#x27;s difficult pregnancy, he returned to the side, scoring England&#x27;s only try against South Africa, when he followed up to touch down after a Lewis Moody charge down. His try against Wales in the quarter-final in Brisbane turned the match for England in a tight game. He finished the tournament as joint top try scorer with five.

He was made vice captain under Lawrence Dallaglio for the 2004 Six Nations tournament. He reached the 50 cap landmark against Ireland and played in all of England&#x27;s Six Nations matches. He won the last of 55 England caps against Australia in 2004.

In 2005 Greenwood was injured for the Six Nations, but was selected for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, his third Lions tour. He replaced Brian O&#x27;Driscoll just two minutes into the first test against New Zealand and also played in the third test.

After 55 England caps and 31 tries he announced his retirement at the end of the 2005/6 season England never lost an international match in which Greenwood scored.

=== International Tries ===

==Post Retirement==
Greenwood worked as an analyst for Sky Sports and regularly appears on &#x27;The Rugby Club&#x27; and live premiership matches, as well as being (with Scott Quinnell) the co-presenter of the School of Hard Knocks Sky TV series. During the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Greenwood was employed by ITV as an analyst for live matches. He also writes a column on the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; discussing the England rugby team. He is a co-founder of a travel and events business, SuperSkills Experiences

In 2019, he was on the first panel to determine the World Rugby women&#x27;s-15s player-of-the-year award with Melodie Robinson, Danielle Waterman, Liza Burgess, Lynne Cantwell, Fiona Coghlan, GaÃ«lle Mignot, Jillion Potter, Stephen Jones, and Karl Te Nana.

Since November 2020, Will has been the Chief Customer Officer at Afiniti&#x27;s London Office

In 2021, Greenwood and Ben Fennell, former Bartle Bogle Hegarty CEO, released &quot;World Class: How to Lead, Learn and Grow like a Champion&quot;.

==Personal life==
Greenwood and his wife, Caroline, have three children. They also had a son Freddie who died 45 minutes after his birth in 2002. Greenwood is a patron of Child Bereavement UK, a charity which supports parents who have lost a child. Greenwood is also a Patron of Borne, a medical research charity looking into the causes of premature birth.

In April 2018, he walked to the North Pole in memory of his son Freddie, who was born at 23 weeks, and helped raise over Â£750,000 for Borne&#x27;s research. Greenwood was awarded a Doctor of Civil Law &quot;honoris causa&quot; by his alma mater Durham University in January 2006. In August 2014, Greenwood was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

Away from rugby and cricket, Greenwood has been a supporter of Manchester City F.C. since he was 9 years old.

<text>John Richard Heaton Greenwood (born 11 September 1940) is an English former rugby union player and coach. A flanker, he played for Waterloo, Cambridge University, Lancashire and . He later coached Preston Grasshoppers and England.

==Biography==
Greenwood was born in Chorley in Lancashire. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Crosby and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

He played for Waterloo, Cambridge University and Lancashire.

In 1966 he made his debut for England against Ireland at Twickenham. In total he won five international caps until 1969, serving as captain in his last game, again against Ireland. He never won a game for England, drawing one and losing four.

In 1973 he was sent to Kenya by the Rugby Football Union on a coaching assignment, and while there was selected to play for The Scorpions, an East African invitation team. After this assignment he moved to Italy to play for Rugby Roma from 1973 to 1976, becoming the Italian Championship&#x27;s best try scorer in 1974 and 1975. So enamoured had he been by his time in Kenya that he persuaded his Italian club to tour East Africa in 1976.

After retiring from playing he coached Preston Grasshoppers. He was coach of England from 1983 to 1985, an unsuccessful period for the national team.

He remained president of Waterloo after his retirement. He is also involved in rugby league, serving as chairman and coaching the junior sides of Prestatyn and Rhyl Panthers since 2011, and is (as of 2015) on the board of directors of Wales Rugby League.

Greenwood was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to rugby.

==Personal life==
Outside rugby, Greenwood was the Assistant Bursar and a geography teacher and head of rugby at Stonyhurst College.

Greenwood and his wife Sue have three children: one daughter and two sons, one of whom is Will Greenwood, who also played rugby for England. Sue is a retired teacher who taught mathematics at Stonyhurst St Mary&#x27;s Hall for over two decades.

Greenwood caused embarrassment for Preston Grasshoppers Rugby Club in November 2021 when he arranged for Nigel Farage to speak at a sportsmans dinner at the club. When the club found out that the divisive former UKIP leader and Brexit campaigner was speaking, they cancelled the event. However, the story was covered widely by the national press after members tweeted that they were cutting up their membership cards in protest at the club being associated with Farage.

<text>The High Evolutionary (Herbert Edgar Wyndham) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is depicted as a scientist who seeks to evolve different life forms such as the New Men. The High Evolutionary&#x27;s goals have often put him at odds with different superheroes.

Chukwudi Iwuji portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023).

==Creation==
Co-creator Stan Lee stated the character was inspired by the H. G. Wells novel &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;.

==Publication history==

The High Evolutionary was first mentioned in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #133 (Oct. 1966), first appears in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #134 (Nov. 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. His minions appeared before him (but only alluded to him), in issue #132.

==Fictional character biography==
Herbert Wyndham was born in Manchester, England. While a student at Oxford in the 1930s, he took an interest in the work of genetic biologist Nathaniel Essex, and began experimenting with genetic manipulation, building a machine (that he called the genetic accelerator) with which he attempted to &quot;evolve&quot; the rats in his mother&#x27;s London basement. While attending a genetics conference in Geneva, Wyndham was approached by a mysterious man (who was in truth the outcast Inhuman geneticist Phaeder) who handed to him papers containing blueprints for cracking the genetic code. With this information to bolster his experiments, Wyndham successfully developed a serum he dubbed &quot;Isotope A&quot;.
Although expelled from the university for his single-mindedness, he finally succeeded in evolving his pet Dalmatian Dempsey into a humanoid life form with the intelligence of a chimpanzee. However, Dempsey was shot by poachers and Wyndham realized that such creatures as he would create would have no place in the human world. In partnership with scientist Jonathan Drew (father of Jessica Drew), Wyndham moved his experiments to the seclusion of Wundagore Mountain in the small Balkan nation of Transia. The discovery of uranium on the land (inherited by Drew&#x27;s wife) provided vast funding, and they bought more land from local baron Gregor Russoff.

Assembling a &quot;citadel of science&quot; designed by German scientist Horace Grayson (father of the future Marvel Boy) and built by Moloid slaves supplied by Phaeder, the pair continued their experiment until Drew&#x27;s daughter fell ill from uranium poisoning and was placed into suspended animation to save her life. Subsequently, Drew&#x27;s wife was attacked and killed by a werewolf (Russoff himself, victim of a family curse), and Drew left Wundagore. Wyndham, on the other hand, developed a suit of protective silver armor for himself and continued his work. Now joined in his work by research assistant Miles Warren (who would later become Jackal), Wyndham was able to make more and more radical breakthroughs, including the genetic acceleration of some local animals into the half-human, half-animal beings that he dubbed his &quot;New Men&quot;.

When Jonathan Drew returned to Wundagore where he was possessed by the ghost of the 6th-century magician Magnus, he warned that the citadel had been constructed upon the place where the malevolent Elder God Chthon had been banished. He began to train the New Men in the ways of combat and chivalry of his time until they eventually came to refer to themselves as the &quot;Knights of Wundagore&quot;, and to Wyndham as the &quot;Lord High Evolutionary&quot;. In 1958, Magnus&#x27;s fears came to pass when Baron Russoff attempted to use the ancient magical tome known as the Darkhold to cure himself of his lycanthropy, inadvertently freeing Chthon from imprisonment. The Knights held him off and Magnus was able to re-bind Chthon. However, on this same night, a pregnant woman named Magda sought refuge at the citadel and gave birth to twin children there. Although she fled after childbirth, the moment of Chthon&#x27;s defeat coincided with the birth of the children, and the baby girl was touched by the demon&#x27;s magic. Wyndham attempted to find foster parents for the children, but when met with failure, they were placed in stasis for decades until suitable candidates were found. Raised by Roma Django and Marya Maximoff, the twins grew up to be the superheroes Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, the latter wielding chaos magic as a result of Chthon&#x27;s influence.
In the modern era, the High Evolutionary encountered the Asgardian thunder god, Thor. Alongside Thor, the High Evolutionary battled the Man-Beast (one of the New Men) and his evil New Men.

Wyndham eventually saw the world as a far too confining place, so he converted his scientific research citadel into a spaceship, exploring the stars with his New Men. He later settled his New Men on a planet, &quot;Wundagore II&quot;, while he stayed on one of the planet&#x27;s moons and began work on a detailed replica of Earth to be located on the opposite side of the Sun. There his New Men regressed to bestial behavior and revolted against him. He captured the Hulk, intending to evolve him forward by a million years. However, his experiment was interrupted by the New Men, who fatally wounded their former master. In desperation, he performed the experiment meant for the Hulk on himself, evolving into a godlike being. In this enlightened state, he was repulsed by his tampering with evolution and devolved the surviving New Men before willing his own existence to dissolve and become one with the cosmos.

The High Evolutionary eventually returned to human form and finished his creation, Counter-Earth. Although Counter-Earth was supposed to be a temporary structure that would be evolved into a paradise, the Man-Beast corrupted the process, and Counter-Earth became an imperfect world. By this time the High Evolutionary had adopted Adam Warlock and bestowed him with the Soul Gem, dispatching him to redeem Counter-Earth. The High Evolutionary aided Adam Warlock against Man-Beast and his agents.

Eventually, one of Galactus&#x27;s Heralds discovered this Counter-Earth. Galactus declared that Counter-Earth was ideally suited for his sustenance (just as the real Earth). The High Evolutionary faced Galactus in battle and lost, while the Fantastic Four and Gorr tried to prevent Galactus from devouring Counter-Earth; eventually the Impossible Man tricked the World Devourer to seek sustenance from the Impossible Man&#x27;s world, Poppup, leading to a fatal condition. Out of compassion, the High Evolutionary saved Galactus by evolving him into living energy that was eventually re-collected by Galactus&#x27;s world ship.

During the earliest phases of its construction, the High Evolutionary&#x27;s Counter-Earth was aggressively targeted for &quot;collection&quot; by the Beyonders (not to be confused with the Beyonder). Agents of the Beyonders manipulated Adam Warlock into murdering the High Evolutionary to allow theft of Counter-Earth, but he was revived by Moondragon and Warlock&#x27;s counterpart, Her. When the High Evolutionary discovered the disappearance of Counter-Earth, alongside the Thing, Alicia Masters, Starhawk, Moondragon, and Her, the High Evolutionary pursued the Beyonders to rescue his world. When the High Evolutionary arrived at the Beyonders&#x27; planet museum, he himself reported that his mind snapped when he witnessed the scope of their powers and how effectively insignificant he was compared to these alien beings. It is this encounter that marks the beginning of the High Evolutionary&#x27;s mental instability.

Although the High Evolutionary claimed that the Beyonders considered Counter-Earth an &quot;interesting but primitive work by a talented provincial&quot;, there has not been an explanation as to why they wished to interrupt the project even before the High Evolutionary had introduced life onto the new world. For unknown reasons, the Beyonders placed all life on Counter-Earth into stasis and later allowed the planet to be destroyed during the Infinity Gauntlet conflict, although they could easily have prevented it.
During the &quot;Evolutionary War&quot; storyline, the High Evolutionary had become increasingly unstable and maniacal. His attempt to end his life was prevented by his suit. He returned to Earth, hoping to find something strong enough to overcome his armor. He goaded the Hulk into attacking him, and Hulk succeeded in smashing his armor; the malfunctioning armor then devolved the High Evolutionary into a mass of one-celled organisms. However, the suit&#x27;s circuits reorganized and restored the High Evolutionary to his previous state. His death and subsequent rebirth gave the High Evolutionary a new insight into the future of mankind. Rather than being a benevolent yet distant protector, as he had been with his New Men, he would take a direct hand in molding the future of humanity, so that they might one day be as powerful as the Beyonders he had witnessed.

The High Evolutionary later came into conflict with a number of superheroes, notably the reserve Avengers and Adam Warlock, when he tried to forcibly mutate (or &quot;evolve&quot;) the entire population of the Earth with his &quot;Evolution Bomb&quot;. The Avengers stopped him, though the High Evolutionary and Hercules were exposed to the High Evolutionary&#x27;s &quot;Genesis Chamber&quot; and became &quot;more than a god&quot;, evolving out of existence.

The evolved essences of the High Evolutionary and Hercules were harvested by the Celestials and imprisoned and manipulated for unknown purposes in the Black Galaxy. Eventually both were returned to human form, and the High Evolutionary returned to space with the Knights of Wundagore. After Thor shaved his beard, one of the New Men brought the shaving bowl containing Thor&#x27;s blood and hair to Count Tager as part of the High Evolutionary&#x27;s plot to create a new race of immortals. After his liberation, the High Evolutionary decided that rather than advancing humanity, he would create all-new gods and immortals using the unique matter that composed the Black Galaxy, including the New Immortals consisting of Analyzer, Count Tagar, Juvan, Nobilus (who was created from Thor&#x27;s DNA samples), and Zon. He and his creations were on-hand to witness the birth of a new Celestial, but viewing this event with all his hyper-evolved senses seemed to drive the High Evolutionary back to madness.

At one point, Ego the Living Planet was investigated by the High Evolutionary, who observed Ego while a titanic, cloud-like entity - which he tentatively designated &quot;Super-Ego&quot; - absorbed Ego. The High Evolutionary theorized that there was more than one Ego (a notion supported by its apparently erratic behavior over the years, the various origin stories known about it, and by the fact that &quot;an&quot; Ego appeared after this one was destroyed by its &quot;parent&quot;) and that they might all stem from the &quot;Super-Ego&quot;.

His mental instability progressed to the point that the High Evolutionary became infatuated with Shanna, wife of Ka-Zar. Infused with the power of the Savage Land&#x27;s terraformer (commissioned by the Beyonders), she had become much like the High Evolutionary himself: powerful, well-meaning, and mentally unstable. The two became obsessed with each other, and nearly departed Earth to create a new world of their own, but Ka-Zar convinced Shanna otherwise. The High Evolutionary repented, agreeing to return Shanna to her normal state once he realized (despite his mania) that the relationship should not be pursued. The High Evolutionary once helped to restore the Savage Land and its inhabitants after the engines that kept the volcanoes active were demolished by Terminus.

The High Evolutionary was revealed to have a student called the High Technician who was responsible for creating a team of uplifted dinosaurs called the Saur-Lords during his time in the Savage Land.

In the &quot;Quicksilver&quot; series, it was revealed that the High Evolutionary&#x27;s genetic code had become unstable, accounting for his periods of mania and aggression. The High Evolutionary became more powerful and maniacal than ever, but Quicksilver was still able to reason with him. With the support of New Men Delphis and Bova, and after nearly losing his life at the hands of the Man-Beast, the High Evolutionary was able to restore himself to an un-evolved human state and mental stability using Isotope G.

The High Evolutionary is now an occasional ally of Thor and other superheroes. He confronted his mentor Mister Sinister alongside the X-Men when the villain took over his satellite-based device (which temporarily shut down the X-Gene of all Earth-based mutants, devolving them into normal humans) and altered it, in a test-of-evolution scheme by force-evolving the entire global human populace.

He was seen in the &quot;X-Men: Endangered Species&quot; one-shot as one of the nine villains Beast approaches to help him reverse the effects of M-Day. In the second chapter of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; storyline, Beast attempts to reach Wundagore Mountain to locate the High Evolutionary. The Knights of Wundagore confront and ultimately escort Beast inside, where the High Evolutionary appears to him as a hologram, giving Beast only cryptic and mostly dismissive answers.

Spider-Man spoke to him during &quot;One More Day&quot; on whether he could do anything to save the life of Aunt May. He could give no useful help.

During the &quot;&quot; event, the High Evolutionary reappeared in Kree space, working on restructuring the Kree genome in a fortress inside a star. Adam Warlock brought Quasar and Moondragon to him after being overwhelmed by Phalanx warriors, who quickly invaded the High Evolutionary&#x27;s vessel. Once Ultron was revealed to be the leader of the Phalanx militia, the High Evolutionary detonated the star, vaporizing his ship, Ultron, and the invading Phalanx warriors. He subsequently was captured by the Phalanx and forced to transfer the essence of Ultron into the body of Adam Warlock, apparently killing him. However, the High Evolutionary was aware that Warlock&#x27;s consciousness had survived and implied that Warlock would &quot;lead the way&quot; for the new Guardians of the Galaxy.

Recently, the High Evolutionary has begun working with Magneto and Blob to determine why so many mutants were depowered on M-Day. He developed a suit for the depowered Magneto that replicated his original powers, and Magneto led an attack on San Francisco as a distraction so that the High Evolutionary could gain a currently unknown object from inside of the Dreaming Celestial. After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial, the High Evolutionary subjected Magneto to an extremely dangerous technological procedure in an attempt to restore his power and was a success.

High Evolutionary had a part in turning an ordinary zoo hippopotamus into the Hippo.

Although not inhabiting Mt. Wundagore at the time, the High Evolutionary still maintained a garrison there where Chthon re-emerged and slaughtered many of the remaining New Men.

Doctor Doom and Mister Fantastic later had the Future Foundation members gather the other geniuses to attend a symposium on how to defeat the &quot;Council of Reeds&quot; (alternate versions of Mister Fantastic who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed&#x27;s intellect while lacking his conscience). High Evolutionary was one of those given the invitation from Thing and the evolved Moloids.

He later drained the Silver Surfer&#x27;s Power Cosmic into himself, rendering the Surfer mortal and giving the High Evolutionary the ability to control and modify the star sphere of the civilization-destroying entity Galactus, allowing him to bestow life to dead worlds. The High Evolutionary created a herald for himself as well as a silver-coated biome of life on Earth, which needed only sunlight to survive, without the need to kill other animals. The Surfer and the Fantastic Four unite with the armed forces to kill all the High Evolutionary&#x27;s creations on the grounds that they eradicate emotion and individuality from the humans who were transformed. They again exterminate the High Evolutionary&#x27;s creations after he begins to terraform the Moon, on the rationale that it will affect tides and animal migrations. Galactus arrives, and the Fantastic Four cheer on Galactus to kill Wyndham, but as the High Evolutionary now serves an equal opposite &quot;World Builder&quot; function of creating rather than committing genocide on sentient civilizations, he allows the High Evolutionary to leave with his star sphere to continue creating new life throughout the universe.

When the High Evolutionary learned that the god-like Celestials were coming to Earth to judge whether humanity should continue to exist or perish, heâwith the help of the Evolutionariesâsystematically began to slaughter his creations, fearing that their unnatural presence may cause the Celestials to deem the planet unworthy.

The High Evolutionary has appeared in the 2015 &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; series. He has apparently created a new Counter-Earth, no longer inhabited by humans but instead by millions of New Men. The High Evolutionary routinely exterminates the entire population of New Men when they ultimately fail to meet his standards of perfection and then re-creates them. He was served in his plans by a human called the Master Scientist and Luminous (a female who was created from the genetic templates of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch while also having the same abilities as them). A human called the Low Evolutionary was one of a few humans living on Counter-Earth who opposed the High Evolutionary. After being tracked down and defeated by Luminous, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch were brought to the High Evolutionary himself. He revealed to them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents. He also told them the truth where they were supposedly not mutants, but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. The High Evolutionary later confronted the Avengers Unity Division when they interfered with his plan to destroy Lowtown (a refuge for a resistance formed by the High Evolutionary&#x27;s rejects, led by the Low Evolutionary). He was defeated after Doctor Voodoo unleashed upon him the thousands of souls of those he had exterminated and was forced to flee through a portal with Luminous.

During the &quot;Last Days&quot; part of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, it was mentioned months ago that the High Evolutionary was among the scientists that Magneto&#x27;s right-hand person Briar tried to contact to make a special cocktail to augment Magneto&#x27;s powers for the upcoming incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

Maker collaborated with High Evolutionary to destroy the Superflow that kept the different universes separate to merge them into one reality. As a result of this action, the Earth-1610 Ultimates members Captain America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Hulk were revived where they were to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.

Continuing his work on Counter-Earth, the High Evolutionary used his technology to accelerate Counter-Earth so that he can have it combine with Earth. To help in that, the High Evolutionary sent a meteor to Earth that altered Earth&#x27;s vibration frequencies where their synching will merge the two planets. This plot attracted the attention of the Avengers and the Champions where Falcon and Viv are unexpectedly teleported to Counter-Earth and brought to the High Evolutionary. He decides to evolve them where he starts by turning Viv into a human. The Avengers and the Champions went to Counter-Earth and fought the New Men and then caused a malfunction with the High Evolutionary&#x27;s teleporter where he seemingly perished. It was discovered during this time that the High Evolutionary had created a clone of himself called the Higher Evolutionary where he had more compassion than his creator and had been hooked up to the Orbit-Engine where his removal will destroy Counter-Earth. The High Evolutionary was actually turned into sentient digital data and trapped in an unknown dimension. As he evolved the life on the planet that he landed on, he had a run-in with Viv who was also sent there as a side-effect of deactivating the Orbit-Engine and states that it would require a digital connection for him to return. Upon discovering that Vision is building Viv 2.0 to replace Viv, the High Evolutionary states that it would be their connection back to their reality. Viv used the connection to go back to her reality while the High Evolutionary was left in the unknown dimension.

The High Evolutionary was returned to his dimension by a machine used by the Knights of Wundagore. He left Counter-Earth upon becoming disappointed with the outcome of his experiment.

At some point as part of the prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Kraven the Hunter hunted some New Men to draw out the High Evolutionary. Kraven cuts a deal with the High Evolutionary to take his DNA sample and create 87 clones of him in order for them to go out into the world and prove themselves to Kraven. The High Evolutionary agrees to the terms and creates the clones. Out of these clones, only one that calls himself the Last Son of Kraven killed the other clones and proved himself to Kraven the Hunter.

In a flashback, the High Evolutionary once visited Madame Monstrosity&#x27;s Farm where he is shown a demonstration on how her Humanimal project works by fusing a plumber with a crab. He states that her work on an arachnid/human hybrid that can devolve and evolve at will is not present and calls her Humanimals a bunch of freaks that disgust him. The High Evolutionary takes his leave telling Madame Monstrosity not to contact him again. When Spider-Boy rouses the Humanimals against a hybridized Madame Monstrosity, the High Evolutionary teleports Madame Monstrosity away in exchange that she would help him in his studies. Once teleported away from Spider-Boy, Madame Monstrosity learned that the High Evolutionary only saved her because she became the ultimate oddity made from the different animal DNA samples in her as he begins his first round of tests with her.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
The High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is the only human whose intelligence and knowledge has been listed as equal to certain cosmic entities. He is considered the leading geneticist in the Marvel universe, and is vastly knowledgeable in biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics.

Due to experimentation on his own genome, his highly enhanced brain and cybernetic exoskeleton, the High Evolutionary has demonstrated god-like powers; including the ability to evolve and devolve life-forms, superhuman strength and durability, manipulating matter at a subatomic level, energy manipulation and projection, cosmic awareness, precognition, telepathy, telekinesis, extra-dimensional travel, and size alteration. On one occasion, he managed to hold his own against Galactus for a prolonged time before being defeated.

Of note, the High Evolutionary has forged weapons for his New Men that show some anti-mystical properties, as demonstrated by a lance wielded by Beast that was actually able to damage the Darkhold.

===Equipment===
His exoskeleton provides him with an uncanny degree of protection from attacks, and also provides life support (filtering/recycling his air and providing sustenance when needed). If he is badly damaged, the suit can heal his wounds and can completely restore him to life using records of his genome and brain activity patterns, as in one instance the suit restored him fully after he had attempted to commit suicide by destroying his own body.

===Personality===
The High Evolutionary&#x27;s character has varied between that of a weary, well-meaning creator to that of a &quot;mad scientist&quot; who is willing to do whatever he considers necessary to further his goals of evolving a better, less-brutal world. He has great respect for the process of evolution, but is also deeply troubled by the immense amount of death and suffering required for such slow progress (see the &quot;Quicksilver&quot; series). Although menacing and arrogant during his maniacal phases, the High Evolutionary&#x27;s history also contains more than one example of his desire to be responsible, creative, and kind. Most Marvel writers have resisted portraying him as a standard-fare villain, thereby adding levels of sympathy and complexity to the character. The High Evolutionary has been manipulated and driven to insanity by both the Beyonders and the Celestials, cosmic races that have interfered with human evolution in the past, indicating that his work might perhaps be a threat to their own. Even at his most unstable, the High Evolutionary has always demonstrated a paternal love toward even his most flawed creations: he rehabilitated Nobilus, has attempted to heal Count Tagar and the God Pack, and has spared the Man-Beast his life despite multiple attempts to murder him. At one point, he offered to (and did) restore the Savage Land after it was destroyed by Terminus, even though it had been created by the very race that had confiscated and then destroyed his own beloved creation, Counter-Earth.

The High Evolutionary played a key role in saving the Earth from Chthon, and rescued Galactus from death despite his attempts to consume Counter-Earth. He has served as a benevolent father figure to several characters, including Adam Warlock, Quicksilver, Spider-Woman, Wolverine, and Thor, often charging them with tasks that lead to their personal growth as individuals and heroes. Along these lines, he has taken a pointed interest in developing a sense of nobility and decency in his creations, most notably the New Men.

At times the High Evolutionary has feigned indifference to the fate of others when his own safety is at stake, only to reveal a considerably more benign agenda later (see the &quot;Annihilation: Conquest&quot; series). More frequently, he has shown a sympathetic and protective concern for the defenseless: on several occasions he has gone to considerable lengths to protect young children, including the critically ill Jessica Drew, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, and Pietro&#x27;s daughter Luna. He gave Magda shelter from the elements without hesitation, risked death to fight Galactus over Counter-Earth, and literally begged Ka-Zar not to poison the Earth&#x27;s biosphere with Isotope E out of compassion for the suffering it would cause. He tried to aid Magneto in reversing the effects of M-Day. He delayed an attack on the Silver Surfer to allow him time to save the life of Suzi Endo, who would briefly become his herald.

Though made personally wealthy by uranium deposits, the High Evolutionary has also provided for a generous financial trust for the people of Transia, ensuring economic stability for the nation.

<text>The Gelechiidae are a family of moths commonly referred to as twirler moths or gelechiid moths. They are the namesake family of the huge and little-studied superfamily Gelechioidea, and the family&#x27;s taxonomy has been subject to considerable dispute. These are generally very small moths with narrow, fringed wings. The larvae of most species feed internally on various parts of their host plants, sometimes causing galls. Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga&quot;) is a host plant common to many species of the family, particularly of the genus &quot;Chionodes&quot;, which as a result is more diverse in North America than usual for Gelechioidea.

By the late 20th century, over 900 genera with altogether more than 4,500 species were placed here, with about 650 genera known from North America alone. While these figures are certainly outdated, due to the many revisions to superfamily Gelechioidea and new descriptions of twirler moths, they still serve to show the enormous biodiversity contained in this important family.

Being abundant, fecund plant-eaters, many species are agricultural pests, including: 
* &quot;Anarsia lineatella&quot; â peach twig borer
* &quot;Aproaerema modicella&quot; â groundnut leafminer
* &quot;Keiferia lycopersicella&quot; â tomato pinworm
* &quot;Pectinophora gossypiella&quot; â pink bollworm
* &quot;Phthorimaea operculella&quot; â potato tuber moth, tobacco splitworm
* &quot;Sitotroga cerealella&quot; â angoumois grain moth
* &quot;Tecia solanivora&quot; â Guatemalan potato moth, Central American potato tuber moth
* &quot;Tuta absoluta&quot; â tomato leafminer, South American tomato moth

The voracious habits of their larvae make twirler moths suitable for biological control of invasive plants. The spotted knapweed seedhead moth (&quot;Metzneria paucipunctella&quot;), for example, is used to control spotted knapweed (&quot;Centaurea maculosa&quot;) in North America.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Compared to the other massively diverse Gelechioidea families â Coleophoridae (case-bearers) and Oecophoridae (concealer moths) â the systematics of the Gelechiidae are far less contentious. The &quot;Deoclonidae&quot;, sometimes treated as a full gelechioid family, seem to be nothing other than a specialized offshoot from within the Gelechiidae, and are here included in the present family; some authors differ, however, and ally at least some of these genera with the Autostichinae and/or Symmocidae. On the other hand, the Schistonoeidae (scavenger moths) are preliminarily considered a distinct family here.

Of the subfamilies traditionally accepted for the Gelechiidae, only three were maintained for some time pending further information; at least one other, the Physoptilinae, were suggested to also be valid. But numerous genera of twirler moths â including most of the former &quot;Deoclonidae&quot; and also the proposed Physoptilinae â were of undetermined affiliation at that moment. Later studies, including a 2013 molecular analysis of the Gelechiidae, list the following subfamilies:

Subfamily Anacampsinae 
Subfamily Anomologinae 
Subfamily Apatetrinae 
Subfamily Dichomeridinae (formerly including Chelariinae, which is now placed in Anacampsinae)
Subfamily Gelechiinae 
Subfamily Physoptilinae 
Subfamily Thiotrichinae 

Genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
*&quot;Aerotypia&quot; .
*&quot;Antithyra&quot; .
*&quot;Coniogyra&quot; .
*&quot;Dicranucha&quot; 
*&quot;Metopios&quot; 
*&quot;Paraschema&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudosymmoca&quot; 
*&quot;Sphagiocrates&quot; 
*&quot;Stenoalata&quot; 
*&quot;Syrmadaula&quot;

<text>SfakiÃ¡ () is a mountainous area in the southwestern part of the island of Crete, in the Chania regional unit. It is considered to be one of the few places in Greece that have never been fully occupied by foreign powers. With a 2021 census population of 2,002 inhabitants living on a land area of , Sfakia is one of the largest and least densely populated municipalities on the island of Crete. The etymology of its name is disputed. According to the prevailing theory, it relates to its rugged terrain, deriving from the ancient Greek word &quot;ÏÏÎ±Î¾&quot;, meaning land chasm or gorge.

==Description==

The road from Chania to SfakiÃ¡ crosses the island from north to south, through the village of Vryses. From this village the route crosses the White Mountains (LefkÃ¡ Ãri) to HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on () by the Libyan Sea. Halfway from Vrisses to HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on is the fertile plateau of Askifou, surrounded by high mountain peaks. From here to HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on the road is particularly spectacular. The road hugs the western slope of the Imbros Gorge offering scenic views. Another scenic route is that leading from Kapsodasos to the plateau of Kallikratis, northeast of HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on. 

There are many beaches in SfakiÃ¡ which do not see the numbers of tourists of the northern coast. More adventurous visitors can follow the European hiking footpath E4 which crosses Crete through SfakiÃ¡&#x27;s mountains. The coastal villages are not connected by a coastal road, but can be reached by ferry boats.

Not far east from HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on is Frangokastello, literally &quot;Frankish castle&quot;. The Venetian fortress here was built in 1371 to deter pirates and unsuccessfully, to control SfakiÃ¡. It is largely ruined but is picturesquely set on a wide sandy beach with the towering White Mountains behind. Daskalogiannis was captured here in 1771.

Accessible only by boat from SfakiÃ¡ is Loutro, a small seaside village with some archaeological ruins, a few houses, small hotels and tavernas. Loutro is car-free; cars must be parked in HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on or PaleohÃ³ra. In the north of SfakiÃ¡ is the fertile plain of Askyfou. The SfakÃ­a region is crossed by many gorges, among which is the famous Samaria Gorge. All these gorges run from north to south and all end in the sea. Many of them can be walked, several even by inexperienced walkers. The region is inhabited by rare animals, like vultures and eagles, and the &quot;kri-kri&quot; (or &quot;agrimi&quot;), the wild Cretan goat. The coast of SfakiÃ¡ is on the Libyan Sea, which is inhabited by a diminishing fish population, but occasionally dolphins, and even whales may be seen. The idea of inaccessibility and ruggedness has played a key role in how Sfakia has been represented since at least the 18th century and it is reiterated in various ways today by tourists and locals.

The local speciality, &quot;Sfakian Pies&quot;, are thin pancakes filled with mizithra cheese and served drizzled with honey.

==Resistance==

HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on is famous as one of the centers of the resistance against the occupying forces of both the Venetians and the Turks. The impenetrable White Mountains to the north combined with the rocky beaches on the south helped the locals fight off all invaders. Anopolis, a village near HÃ³ra SfakÃ­on, is the birthplace of one of the most celebrated Cretan revolutionaries, Daskalogiannis.

A famous legend and unexplained phenomenon describes a procession of visions (Drosoulites) seen in the nearby village Frangokastello as troops that died in the war of independence against the Turks.

Patrick Leigh Fermor wrote about the tall proud Sfakians and their resistance to occupation. Many tales of revolts and uprisings in Crete start in the mountains of western Crete - mountain guerillas, pallikari fighters and rebel assemblies.

After the Battle of Crete during World War II, the locals helped many Australian and New Zealand soldiers escape from here on the night of May 31, 1941, suffering great reprisals. King George II of Greece had already escaped this way when the Germans invaded. Near the village of Komitades is the Church of Panagia Thymiani where the revolution of 1821 began. At the village of Loutro is the ruined &quot;chancellery&quot; where the first revolutionary government of 1821 met.

SfakiÃ¡ is notorious for the harshness of the environment and the warlike people. Sfakians themselves are still considered somewhat beyond the reach of the lawmakers and tax collectors of Athens, with vendettas over stolen sheep and women&#x27;s honour still fought into the mid-20th century, with a whole village abandoned.

Stealing and banditry had been considered a way of life in the mountains, even appearing in a Creation myth, which made God Himself a Sfakiot, as recounted by Adam Hopkins:

:&quot;...with an account of all the gifts God had given to other parts of Crete - olives to Ierapetra, Ayios Vasilios and Selinou; wine to Malevisi and Kissamou; cherries to Mylapotamos and Amari. But when God got to Sfakia only rocks were left. So the Sfakiots appeared before Him armed to the teeth. &quot;And us Lord, how are we going to live on these rocks?&quot; and the Almighty, looking at them with sympathy, replied in their own dialect (naturally): &quot;Haven&#x27;t you got a scrap of brains in your head? Don&#x27;t you see that the lowlanders are cultivating all these riches for you?&quot;&quot;

The Sfakians are also famous for their hospitality and generosity towards guests, resulting in a shift from traditional labour towards tourism, with now many families running their own small hotel or restaurant. Many northern European visitors to the area in the 1970s onward who still return today stress hospitality as key element that attracted them to Sfakia. Conversing with these visitors&#x27; impressions, locals are very interested in the idea of hospitality as a form of cultural distinctiveness and morality and they often debate what it means to speak of hospitality in the age of mass tourism.

==History==
The archeology and history of Sfakia is the object of a field survey undertaken by the University of Oxford.

==Province==
The province of Sfakia () was one of the provinces of the Chania Prefecture. It had the same territory as the present municipality. It was abolished in 2006.

<text>The Ahtna (also Ahtena, Atna, Ahtna-kohtaene, or Copper River) are an Alaska Native Athabaskan people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group. The people&#x27;s homeland called Atna Nenn&#x27;, is located in the Copper River area of southern Alaska, and the name Ahtna derives from the local name for the Copper River. The total population of Ahtna is estimated at around 1,427.

Their neighbors are other Na-DenÃ©-speaking and Yupik peoples: Dena&#x27;ina (west), Koyukon (a little part of northwest), Lower Tanana (north), Tanacross (north), Upper Tanana (northeast), Southern Tutchone (southeast, in Canada), Tlingit (southeast), Eyak (south), and Chugach Sugpiaq (south).

==Synonymy==
The name &quot;Ahtena&quot;, also written as &quot;Ahtna&quot; and &quot;Atnatana&quot;, translates as &quot;ice people.&quot; In some documentation the Ahtna have been called Copper Indians because of their ancestral homeland located in the basin of the Copper River and its tributaries in southeastern Alaska. The word for the Copper River in Ahtna is &#x27;Atna&#x27; tuu&quot; (tuu meaning water). Thus, &quot;Ahtna&quot; refers to the People of the &#x27;Atna&#x27; River (i.e. The Copper River). The named Yellowknife has also been used in reference to the Ahtna&#x27;s copper-colored knives; however, another tribe, the Yellowknives, are also referred to as Copper Indians.

==Language==
The Ahtna are an Athabaskan languages speaking tribe of the Subarctic cultural area, which classifies them as both Athabaskan and Subarctic Indians. Depending on the community&#x27;s location along the Copper River, dialectal differences may occur. The Lower Ahtna (Ahtna&#x27;ht&#x27;aene) are near the river&#x27;s mouth which opens into the Gulf of Alaska, the Middle Ahtna (Dan&#x27;ehwt&#x27;aene) are upriver a distance, and the Upper Ahtna (Tate&#x27;ahwt&#x27;aene) live on the upper parts of the river. The Tanaina people of the west are their closest linguistic relatives. About 80 Ahtnas are believed to still speak the Ahtna language. In 1990 a dictionary was published by university linguist James Kari, in order to preserve the language. Several years later, the Ahtna People themselves published a noun dictionary of their language (The Ahtna Noun Dictionary of Pronunciation Guide: Ahtna Heritage Foundation/Ahtna, Inc., 1998, 2011 Revised).

==History==
===Origins and early history===

About 2,000 years ago the Ahtna people moved into the area of the Wrangell Mountains and the Chitina Valley. Prior to that, their ancestors moved into the area of the Upper and Middle Susitna area about 7,000 years ago.

===European contact===

In 1781 the Russians made it to the mouth of the Copper River. Over the course of years, Russians would try to go up the river only to be pushed back by the Ahtna. In 1819 the Russians built a post at the confluence of the Copper and Chitina Rivers, which was destroyed.

===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. A US military expedition led by Henry Tureman Allen in 1885 explored the Copper River and surrounding area.

===Historical regional bands and dialects and present day Native Villages===
There are four main dialect divisions and eight historic regional bands (tribal unions): To take advantage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971, the Ahtna formed Ahtna, Incorporated. The organization is a for-profit entity that oversees the land obtained under ANCSA (The Native Village of Chitina (Tsedi NÃ¡) is organized by the Chitina Native Corporation). 714,240 acres were allocated, consisting of eight villages:

==Culture==
===Governance===


===Architecture===
In the summertime the Ahtna used temporary rectangular dwellings made of spruce and cottonwood. These structures had bark-covered sides and skin-covered entrances to provide access. In the wintertime, families lived in large semi-underground homes. As large as 10 feet wide by 36 feet long, these dwellings were constructed from wood and covered with spruce bark. Sometimes a second room was attached to be used for sweating rituals.
===Family life===
When traveling by water, moose-hide boats were used. In the wintertime, snowshoes and load-bearing toboggans were used. When traveling by foot and carrying goods, people, usually women, would use a tumpline. The tumpline was made of animal skin or cloth and was slung across the forehead or chest to support a heavy load on the back.

===Subsistence===
Traditionally the Ahtna hunted many different types of animals such as the moose, caribou, mountain sheep, and rabbits. Salmon was a staple, being caught with nets in rivers and streams. To support healthy prey populations, the Athna would monitor and reduce predator populations such as wolves, eagles and bears. For example, they would keep track of wolf dens in traditional hunting areas and by killing cubs. A central figure in their mythology, the Ahtna might prop up killed wolves and feed ceremonial meals to them. The Ahtna also gathered berries and roots.

===Economy===
The Ahtna were historically part of a trade network with other Athabaskans, the Alutiiq, and the Tlingit. They would barter furs, hides and copper, and eventually manufactured European goods after encounters with the Europeans. Trade meetings would take place three times a year at Nuchek on the Prince William Sound.

The Ahtna operate Ahtna, Inc., an Alaska Native corporation founded in 1971. Ahata has provided services to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Port Isabel Detention Center since at least 2008. The contract will earn Ahtna Technical Services (ATS) at least $800 million.

<text>Alonzo C. Babers (born October 31, 1961) is an American former athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics, in the 400 m and the 4 Ã 400 m relay.

Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Alonzo Babers was a military dependent who graduated from Kaiserslautern American High School in West Germany. He attended the United States Air Force Academy from 1979 to 1983, graduating with a major in aerospace engineering, where he ran track and played one season of football.

The international athletics career of Alonzo Babers consisted of a spectacular rise to fame, followed by a decisive and abrupt end. Up to the end of 1982, Babers&#x27;s best time in 400 m was 45.9, but he rapidly improved on that during 1983, running a best time of 45.07, but at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki he finished in a disappointing sixth place in the 4 Ã 400 m relay.

Babers continued his rapid improvement in 1984. At the USA Final Olympic Trials in Los Angeles, he won his semi-final in a personal best of 44.95. Later, in the final, he ran another personal best of 44.86 to qualify to the Olympic team. At the Los Angeles Olympic Games he further lowered his personal best to 44.75 when he won his quarterfinal. In the Olympic final, Babers ran 44.27 to win the gold medal. In the 4 Ã 400 m relay, United States (Babers ran the third leg) won the gold medal easily in 2:57.91.

While training for and competing in the 1984 Olympics, Babers held the rank of lieutenant in the United States Air Force. Just one month after his double-gold performance in Los Angeles, Babers reported to flight training school and began his career as a pilot, so his athletics career was over. He was an active-duty officer in the United States Air Force from 1983 to 1991 and continues to serve as a member of the Air Force Reserves. He later became a Boeing 777 captain for United Airlines.

<text>Mirella Freni, (, born Mirella Fregni, 27 February 1935Â â 9 February 2020) was an Italian operatic soprano who had a career of 50 years and appeared at major international opera houses. She received international attention at the Glyndebourne Festival, where she appeared as Zerlina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and as Adina in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;.

Freni is associated with the role of MimÃ¬ in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohÃ¨me&quot;, which featured in her repertoire from 1957 to 1999 and which she sang at La Scala in Milan and the Vienna State Opera in 1963, conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She also performed the role in a film of the production and as her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1965. In the earliest opera DVDs, she portrayed her characters convincingly in both acting and singing. Freni was married for many years to the Bulgarian bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, with whom she performed and recorded. Her obituary from &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes her as a &quot;matchless Italian prima donna&quot;.

== Life ==
Born in Modena, she had the same wet-nurse as Luciano Pavarotti, with whom she grew up and who was to become a frequent tenor partner on stage. She studied voice first with her uncle, Dante Arcelli, then with Luigi Bertazzoni and Ettore Campogalliani. She later changed her name thinking it was easier to pronounce. Freni made her operatic debut at the Teatro Municipale in her hometown on 3 March 1955 as MicaÃ«la in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. She later married her teacher, the pianist and director Leone Magiera; the couple had a daughter. Freni resumed her career in 1958 when she performed MimÃ¬ in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohÃ¨me&quot; at the Teatro Regio in Turin, and sang in De Nederlandse Opera&#x27;s 1959â60 season. Her international breakthrough came at the Glyndebourne Festival, where she appeared in 1960 as Zerlina in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, alongside Joan Sutherland as Donna Anna, and in 1962 as Susanna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, and as Adina in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, directed by Franco Zeffirelli.

In 1961, Freni first performed at the Royal Opera House in London as Nannetta in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. She stepped in as Nannetta at La Scala in Milan for Renata Scotto. On 31 January 1963, she appeared there as MimÃ¬ in a production staged by Franco Zeffirelli and conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She became one of the conductor &#x27;s favourite singers in operas and concerts. The production was repeated at the Vienna State Opera the same year, and she appeared at the house in eleven roles, including the title role of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, and Amelia in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;.

On 29 September 1965, she first appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, again as MimÃ¬, with Gianni Raimondi as Rodolfo who also made his house debut. Reviewer Alan Rich wrote in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;: She later appeared there as Adina in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, LiÃ¹ in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Juliette in &quot;RomÃ©o et Juliette&quot;, as Susanna, Micaela and Manon Lescaut. The following year she sang MimÃ¬ again for her Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company debut, with Flaviano LabÃ² as Rodolfo. From the early 1970s into the 1980s, Freni sang heavier Verdi roles, including Elisabetta in John Dexter&#x27;s production of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot; (alongside Jon Vickers), Amelia in &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, Elvira in the Luca Ronconi staging of &quot;Ernani&quot;, Leonora in &quot;La forza del destino&quot;, and the title role of &quot;Aida&quot; performed in the Houston Grand Opera in 1987. She appeared as Puccini&#x27;s Tosca only on a recording. She performed as Manon Lescaut in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s 1990 season, and recorded &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and the three roles of &quot;Il trittico&quot;.

Freni chose her roles carefully, saying in an interview: &quot;I am generous in many ways, but not when I think it will destroy my voice. Some singers think they are gods who can do everything. But I have always been honest with myself and my possibilities.&quot; She refused Karajan&#x27;s offers of Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot; and the title role in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. Elvira in &quot;Ernani&quot; was set aside after a single run at La Scala (and despite offers to sing the role elsewhere). She never sang Cio-Cio-San on stage, but recorded it twice, not including the 1975 film &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, alongside PlÃ¡cido Domingo, with Karajan conducting and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle directing. She played Susanna in the Ponnelle film of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, which also featured Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Kiri Te Kanawa and Hermann Prey.

In 1978, after her marriage to Magiera had ended in divorce, she married Nicolai Ghiaurov, one of the leading operatic basses of the post-war period. Together they helped to establish the Centro Universale del Bel Canto in Vignola, where they began giving master classes in 2002. After Ghiaurov&#x27;s death in 2004, Freni continued their work of preserving the bel canto tradition, teaching young singers from around the world.

Freni extended her repertoire and style during the 1990s with Italian Verismo, taking on the title roles of Francesco Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; in Milan, Paris, Barcelona and New York, and Umberto Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Fedora&quot; in London, Milan, New York, Torino, Barcelona and ZÃ¼rich. In 1997, she performed Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Madame Sans-GÃªne&quot; at the Teatro Massimo Bellini. During this time she sang in Russian operas, such as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Tatiana in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Lisa in &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, and Ioanna in &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;. Freni ended her professional career on stage, performing teenager Ioanna at the age of 70 at the Washington National Opera on 11 April 2005.

Freni died on 9 February 2020 at her home in Modena. According to her manager, she died &quot;after a long degenerative illness and a series of strokes&quot;. On 12 February, her coffin was moved from the funeral home to the Teatro Comunale Modena for public tribute and then transferred in a procession to Modena Cathedral, where the funeral took place.

== Honours ==
Freni was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in the grade of Knight Grand Cross in 1990, and the French Legion of Honour in March 1993. In 1995, she was appointed Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. The University of Pisa awarded her an honorary degree in 2002 for her &quot;great contribution to European culture.&quot; In 2009, she was promoted to the rank of Officer in the Legion of Honour.

In a broadcast matinÃ©e of &quot;Fedora&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera on April 26, 1997, Freni was presented with the Key to the City of New York by then mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.

In 2005, the Metropolitan Opera celebrated the 40th anniversary of her Met debut and her 50th anniversary on stage with a special gala concert conducted by James Levine.

<text>Crambidae comprises the grass moth family of lepidopterans. They are variable in appearance, with the nominal subfamily Crambinae (grass moths) taking up closely folded postures on grass stems where they are inconspicuous, while other subfamilies include brightly coloured and patterned insects that rest in wing-spread attitudes.

In many classifications, the Crambidae have been treated as a subfamily of the Pyralidae or snout moths. The principal difference is a structure in the tympanal organs called the praecinctorium, which joins two tympanic membranes in the Crambidae, and is absent from the Pyralidae. The latest review by Munroe and Solis, in Kristensen (1999), retains the Crambidae as a full family. The family currently comprises 15 subfamilies with altogether 10,347 species in over 1,000 genera.

==Systematics==

*Subfamily Spilomelinae (= Wurthiinae )

==Relationship with humans==
Since crambids are relatively common throughout human settlements, the moths tend to affect crops and gardens, whether harmfully, beneficially or harmlessly. Beneficial crambids include the water hyacinth moth (&quot;Niphograpta albiguttalis&quot;), used to control its host (&quot;Eichhornia crassipes&quot;), the water veneer (&quot;Acentria ephemerella&quot;), a biocontrol agent used against Eurasian watermilfoil, and the bamboo borer (&quot;Omphisa fuscidentalis&quot;), of which the caterpillars are used for human consumption. The mint moth (&quot;Pyrausta aurata&quot;) is an example of a harmless crambid.

Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops, some Crambidae species achieve pest status. The European corn borer &quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot; is perhaps the best known; introduced to the United States in the early 1900s, it is now widespread in all but the westernmost states. Other pest species include the pearl millet stem borer (&quot;Coniesta ignefusalis&quot;), the spotted stalk borer (&quot;Chilo partellus&quot;), the Asiatic rice borer (&quot;Chilo suppressalis&quot;), sod webworms (&quot;Crambus&quot; spp.), &quot;Duponchelia fovealis&quot;, the sugarcane borer (&quot;Diatraea saccharalis&quot;), bean pod borers (&quot;Maruca&quot; spp.), the rice white stemborer (&quot;Scirpophaga innotata&quot;), the southwestern corn borer (&quot;Diatraea grandiosella&quot;), and the grape leaffolder (&quot;Desmia maculalis&quot;).

<text>Delfino Codazzi (7 March 1824 in Lodi â 21 July 1873 in Pavia) was an Italian mathematician.

He made some important contributions to the differential geometry of surfaces, such as the CodazziâMainardi equations.

==Biography==
He graduated in mathematics at the University of Pavia, where he was a pupil of Antonio Bordoni. For a long period Codazzi taught first at the Ginnasio Liceale of Lodi, then at the liceo of Pavia. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to research in differential geometry.

In 1865, he was appointed professor of complementary algebra and analytic geometry at University of Pavia. He remained in his position at Pavia until his death in 1873.

He also obtained results concerning isometric lines, geodesic triangles, equiareal mapping and the stability of floating bodies.

<doc id="703287" wikidata="Q2420785" url="?curid=703287" title="America (Simon &amp; Garfunkel song)">
<text>&quot;America&quot; is a song performed by American music duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, which they included on their fourth studio album, &quot;Bookends,&quot; in 1968. It was produced by the duo and Roy Halee. The song was later issued as the B-side of the single &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her (live version)&quot; in 1972 to promote the release of the compilation album &quot;Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. After peaking in the charts in July 1972, the song was switched to the A-side of the single and re-entered the charts in November 1972.

The song was written and composed by Paul Simon, and concerns young lovers hitchhiking their way across the United States, in search of &quot;America&quot;, in both a literal and figurative sense. It was inspired by a 1964 road trip that Simon took with his then-girlfriend Kathy Chitty. The song has been regarded as one of Simon&#x27;s strongest songwriting efforts and one of the duo&#x27;s best songs. A 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reader&#x27;s poll ranked it the group&#x27;s fourth-best song.

==Background==

&quot;America&quot; was inspired by a five-day road excursion Simon undertook in September 1964 with Chitty. Producer Tom Wilson had called Simon, living in London at the time, back to the United States to finalize mixes and artwork for their debut studio album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; Simon, reluctant to leave Chitty, invited her to come with him; they spent five days driving the country together. Several years later, &quot;America&quot; was among the last songs recorded for &quot;Bookends&quot;, when production assistant John Simon left Columbia Records, forcing Simon, Garfunkel, and producer Roy Halee to complete the record themselves. In 2004, Bob Dyer, a former disc jockey from Saginaw, Michigan, explained the song&#x27;s genesis in an interview with &quot;The Saginaw News&quot;. According to Dyer, Simon wrote the song while visiting the town in 1966 after Dyer had booked him for Y-A-Go-Go, a concert series hosted by the Saginaw YMCA.

==Composition==
&quot;America&quot; is a song that &quot;creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer&#x27;s search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country&#x27;s beauty and ideals.&quot; Art Garfunkel once described the song as &quot;young lovers with their adventure and optimism&quot;. The song has been described as a &quot;folk song with a lilting soprano saxophone in its refrain as a small pipe organ paints acoustic guitars, framed by the ghostly traces of classic American Songbook pop structures.&quot; &quot;America&quot; is composed in the key of D major and set in a 6/8 time signature, and has a moderately fast groove of 172 beats per minute. The duo&#x27;s vocals span from the low note of A2 to the high note of E4. Drummer Hal Blaine, keyboardist Larry Knechtel, and bassist Joe Osborn provide additional instrumentation on the track. The lyrics are written in blank verse.

The song opens, on &quot;Bookends&quot;, with a crossfade from &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot;. (This effect is not present on the single versions, which begin with a &quot;clean&quot; open.) The song follows two young loversÂ â &quot;an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance&quot;Â â who set out &quot;to look for America.&quot; The lyrics mention Saginaw, Michigan, with the narrator seemingly having left the town to seek &quot;his fortunes elsewhere&quot;. The narrator&#x27;s companion, Kathy, is a reference to Chitty, linking the song autobiographically to the earlier Simon and Garfunkel hit &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, and to &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot;, a love song from a previous album, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;.

The narrator spends four days hitchhiking from Saginaw to join Kathy in Pittsburgh, where together they board a Greyhound bus to continue the journey. For the trip, they purchase cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner&#x27;s Pies. The narrator begins with a lighthearted and optimistic outlook (&quot;Let us be lovers, we&#x27;ll marry our fortunes together&quot;) that fades over the course of the song. To pass time, he and Kathy play games and try to guess the backgrounds of their fellow passengers. Over the course of their journey, they smoke all their cigarettes. Kathy reads a magazine before falling asleep, leaving the narrator awake to reflect on the meaning of the journey alone. In the final verse, the narrator is able to speak his true emotions to Kathy, now that she is sleeping and cannot hear or answer. &quot;I&#x27;m empty and aching and I don&#x27;t know why&quot; captures the longing and angst of the 1960s in nine simple words. The narrator then stares out the window &quot;counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike&quot;. Many other empty, aching, and lost souls are on the highway, each on their own journey alone even if someone is traveling with them. The soaring harmony lines and crashing cymbals create a powerful and poignant end to the song&#x27;s final verse: &quot;They&#x27;ve all come to look for America.&quot; Pete Fornatale interprets this lyric as a &quot;metaphor to remind us all of the lost souls wandering the highways and byways of mid-sixties America, struggling to navigate the rapids of despair and hope, optimism and disillusionment.&quot;

==Reception==
Stephen Holden, in reviewing &quot;Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; in 1972, wrote, &quot;&#x27;America&#x27;Â ... was Simon&#x27;s next major step forward. It is three and a half minutes of sheer brilliance, whose unforced narrative, alternating precise detail with sweeping observation evokes the panorama of restless, paved America and simultaneously illuminates a drama of shared loneliness on a bus trip with cosmic implications.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called the single version from &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; &quot;a more commercial, elaborate production than appeared on the &quot;Bookends&quot; album.&quot; Thom Jurek of Allmusic described the song&#x27;s central question as an &quot;ellipsis, a cipher, an unanswerable question&quot;, a song in which &quot;sophisticated harmonic invention is toppled by its message&quot;. David Nichols, in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, called the song &quot;a splendid vignette of a road trip by young lovers; both intimate and epic in scale, it traces an inner journey from naive optimism to more mature understanding.&quot; &quot;American Songwriter&quot; deemed the song &quot;essentially a road-trip song, but like all road trips, it tends to reveal as much about the participants as it does about the lands being traversed.&quot;

Disc jockey and author Pete Fornatale describes &quot;America&quot; as one of Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;greatest writing achievements in this phase of his career&quot;. In 2014, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll ranked it fourth among the duo&#x27;s best compositions, with the magazine writing, &quot;it captured America&#x27;s sense of restlessness and confusion during the year that saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the escalation of the war in Vietnam&quot;, declaring it one of their most &quot;beloved&quot; songs.

==Legacy==
The song enjoyed a resurgence in popularityÂ â and was introduced to a new generationÂ â after being featured in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; in 2000. An early scene in the film, set in 1968, finds the free-spirited character &quot;Anita&quot; (Zooey Deschanel) playing the song for her mother (Frances McDormand) to &quot;...explain why [she] is leaving home to become a stewardess&quot;. The financial services company American Express also used the song in a series of popular television advertisements in the late 2010s.

In 2010, lyrics from the song began appearing spray-painted on vacant buildings and abandoned factories in the town of Saginaw, Michigan, which is mentioned in the song. The group of artists, Paint Saginaw, decided to paint the phrases after the population had dwindled vastly, noting that the song became rather &quot;homesick&quot; for the town&#x27;s residents. The song&#x27;s entire lyrics are painted on 28 buildings in the city, including railroad tracks and bridge supports.

The song was featured in &quot;America&quot;, a television advertisement for the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The campaign sought permission to use it from Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel themselves, who both agreed. Garfunkel stated that he was a supporter of Sanders and his campaign, and that the usage of &quot;America&quot; did not take away from the song&#x27;s original premise.

The song appears in a 2017 TV commercial for the Volkswagen Atlas. It is referenced in the novel The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai.

==Cover versions==

===1-2-3/Clouds===
The earliest known performances of &quot;America&quot; came from the band Clouds. In their earlier incarnation as 1-2-3, they had performed a re-written version of the song that included elements similar to those later used by Yes; changes in time signature, classical interludes, newly written segments, etc. A live tape exists of this being performed at the Marquee in April 1967, prior to the release of any known recording by any artist, including Paul Simon, himself. Simon had recorded demos at Levy studios in London in 1965, and tapes of these were passed to the band by a studio engineer (Stu Francis of Radio Luxembourg). In 1966, 1-2-3 also performed &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; from this same tape.

===Yes===
The song was rearranged by the progressive rock band Yes in 1970, performing it in concert on the first tour after Steve Howe replaced Peter Banks. Yes added elements typical to progressive rock, such as changes in time signature and long instrumental segments, while dropping the song&#x27;s original repeat and fade ending. At one point bassist Chris Squire quotes &quot;America&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot; in the intro. The Yes studio version clocks in at ten and a half minutes, with live versions on the 1970â1971 tour extended to more than fifteen minutes. The studio recording first appeared in 1972 on the sampler album &quot;The New Age of Atlantic&quot; and was later included on the compilation album &quot;Yesterdays&quot; in 1975, the box set &quot;In a Word: Yes (1969â)&quot; in 2002, and on the 2003 re-issue of their album &quot;Fragile&quot;. An edited version of this recording lasting 4 minutes was released as a single and hit No. 46 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also reached No. 20 in New Zealand. It also appeared on the &quot;Yesyears&quot; boxed set and its condensed version &quot;Yesstory,&quot; along with &quot;The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection.&quot; The edited version was also included as a bonus track on the 2003 re-issue of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, while the unedited studio version appears on Steven Wilson&#x27;s 2013 remix of the same album. A live version of the song was included on 1996&#x27;s &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; as well as a performance from the final show of the 1970â1971 tour (which preceded the studio recording) on 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Word Is Live&quot;.

&quot;Record World&quot; called the single &quot;An ironic choice of material, but an excellent one.&quot;

Guitarist Steve Howe considers Yes&#x27;s version to be &quot;a kind of lost recording&quot; among the band&#x27;s work, since it has rarely been included on their compilations, and when it is it is usually a shortened version. When he had the chance to meet Simon in person at a disaster-relief concert in 1992, Howe asked him if he liked Yes&#x27;s version, and Simon said he did.

They performed a live version on the Marc Riley show for BBC Radio 6 Music on September 4, 2012.

<text>The Pyralidae, commonly called pyralid moths, snout moths or grass moths, are a family of Lepidoptera in the ditrysian superfamily Pyraloidea. In many (particularly older) classifications, the grass moths (Crambidae) are included in the Pyralidae as a subfamily, making the combined group one of the largest families in the Lepidoptera. The latest review by Eugene G. Munroe and Maria Alma Solis retain the Crambidae as a full family of Pyraloidea.

The wingspans for small and medium-sized species are usually between with variable morphological features.

It is a diverse group, with more than 6,000 species described worldwide, and more than 600 species in America north of Mexico, comprising the third largest moth family in North America. At least 42 species have been recorded from North Dakota in the subfamilies of Pyralidae.

==Relationship with humans==
Most of these small moths are inconspicuous. Many are economically important pests, including waxworms, which are the caterpillar larvae of the greater (&quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;) and lesser (&quot;Achroia grisella&quot;) wax moths (subfamily Galleriinae). They are natively pests of beehives, but are bred indoors in enormous numbers as live food for small reptile and bird pets and similar animals. They are also used as fishing bait for trout fishing.

Other notable snout moth pests relevant for their larval hosts include:
* Alligatorweed stem borer (&quot;Arcola malloi&quot;: Phycitinae) â biological control of alligator weed (&quot;Alternanthera philoxeroides&quot;).
* Almond moth (&quot;Cadra cautella&quot;: Phycitinae) â pest of stored cereals and dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide.
* Cacao moth, tobacco moth, warehouse moth (&quot;Ephestia elutella&quot;: Phycitinae) â pest of stored dry vegetable products; Europe, introduced to some other regions (e.g. Australia).
* Dried fruit moth (&quot;Cadra calidella&quot;: Phycitinae)
* &quot;Etiella behrii&quot; (Phycitinae) â pest of stored legumes; Southeast Asia and Australia
* &quot;Flour moths&quot; â pests of stored grains, spices, flour, and similar dry vegetable products; now introduced almost worldwide.
** Indian mealmoth (&quot;Plodia interpunctella&quot;: Phycitinae)
** Mediterranean flour moth, Indian flour moth (&quot;Ephestia kuehniella&quot;: Phycitinae)
* Grease moth (&quot;Aglossa pinguinalis&quot;: Pyralinae) â pest of suet and other oily food.
* Lesser cornstalk borer (&quot;Elasmopalpus lignosellus&quot;: Phycitinae) â stalk pest of corn (&quot;Zea mays&quot;); tropical and subtropical Americas, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.
* Locust bean moth (&quot;Ectomyelois ceratoniae&quot;: Phycitinae)
* Mahogany webworm (&quot;Macalla thyrsisalis&quot;: Epipaschiinae) â defoliator pest of mahogany trees (&quot;Swietenia&quot;); Neotropics.
* Meal moth (&quot;Pyralis farinalis&quot;: Pyralinae) â pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals; now introduced almost worldwide.
* Pear fruit borer (&quot;Pempelia heringii&quot;: Phycitinae) â pest of apple and pear fruits; East Asia, introduced to the Hawaiian Islands.
* Pine webworm (&quot;Pococera robustella&quot;: Epipaschiinae) â defoliator pest of pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;); North America east of Great Lakes region.
* Raisin moth (&quot;Cadra figulilella&quot;: Phycitinae) â pests of stored dry fruit; now introduced almost worldwide.
* Rice moth (&quot;Corcyra cephalonica&quot;: Galleriinae) â pest of stored grain, flour and other cereals.
* South American cactus moth (&quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot;: Phycitinae) â biological control of prickly pears (&quot;Opuntia&quot;).
* Southern pine coneworm, &quot;pitch moth&quot; (&quot;Dioryctria amatella&quot;: Phycitinae) â cone and shoot pest of pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;); southern North America.
* Stored nut moth (&quot;Paralipsa gularis&quot;: Galleriinae) â pest of stored nuts and drupes; Southeast Asia, introduced to Western Europe.
* Sunflower moth (&quot;Homoeosoma nebulella&quot;: Phycitinae) â pest of sunflower seeds; Europe and surrounding regions.

The European corn borer (&quot;Ostrinia nubilalis&quot;) and southern cornstalk borer (&quot;Diatraea crambidoides&quot;), formerly considered snout moths, are placed in the Crambidae which, as noted above, are usually regarded as a separate family today.

==Systematics==
Five subfamilies are generally recognized in the Pyralidae today. The Acentropinae (= Nymphulinae), occasionally still placed here, do indeed seem to belong in the Crambidae.

The snout moth subfamilies are, listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence from the most primitive to the most advanced:

* Chrysauginae (including Bradypodicolinae, Semniidae) â about 400 species occurring predominantly in the Neotropical region. Larvae typically feed on plants, but some have more unusual feeding habits. The latter include for example some myrmecophilous species, as well as a number of sloth moths which are dependent on sloths for their entire life cycle. Most Chrysauginae larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax.
* Galleriinae (including Macrothecinae) â about 300 species worldwide. The males of galleriine moths have a gnathos almost or completely reduced, the pupae have a prominent dorsal median ridge on the thorax and abdomen, and most larvae have a sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the first abdominal segment.
* Pyralinae (including Endotrichinae, Hypotiinae) â rather diverse in the Old World; a lesser number of the roughly 900 species occurs elsewhere. The females of almost all Pyralinae except &quot;Cardamyla&quot; and &quot;Embryoglossa&quot; are recognizable by the very short ductus bursae of their genitals.
* Epipaschiinae (including Pococerinae) â over 550 described species in the tropical and temperate regions (except Europe). Larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers, or leaf miners. Some species are minor pests of a few commercial crops. Epipaschiinae are generally hard to recognize, except in the case of adult males which have a few characteristic traits, such as the upturned and pointed third segment of the labial palps and usually a scaly projection from the antenna base. The larvae lack any stereotyped seta sclerotisations.
* Phycitinae (including Anerastiinae, Peoriinae) â probably the most difficult group of Pyraloidea in terms of identification and classification. They comprise more than 600 genera and about 4000 species found all over the world. The characteristic trait of the caterpillars is a sclerotised area encircling the base of seta SD1 on the mesothorax, while the adult females have â like the males of Pyralidae in general do â a frenulum consisting of a single bristle which in turn is composed of multiple acanthae.
===Problematic genera===
In addition to those assigned to the tribes above, several genera of (presumed) Pyralidae are not firmly placed in this arrangement, but are &quot;incertae sedis&quot;. Some may be very basal lineages which stand outside the main snout moth radiations, but given the changing circumscription of the Pyralidae, some are likely to be placed outside this group in its modern meaning, either in the Crambidae or in other lineages of basal Obtectomera. Some may even belong to more ancient moth lineages, such as the Alucitoidea or Pterophoroidea. Finally, some of these (usually little-studied) genera possibly are junior synonyms of genera described earlier. These genera are in the unranked category of the family Pyralidae.

The genera in question are:

* &quot;Apocabimoides&quot; 
* &quot;Ardjuna&quot; 
* &quot;Cabimoides&quot; 
* &quot;Cryptophycita&quot; 
* &quot;Cryptozophera&quot; 
* &quot;Delcina&quot; (Phycitinae?)
* &quot;Eupassadena&quot; 
* &quot;Gomezmenoria&quot; 
* &quot;Gunungodes&quot; 
* &quot;Indocabnia&quot; 
* &quot;Inverina&quot; 
* &quot;Kasyapa&quot; 
* &quot;Kaurava&quot; 
* &quot;Kumbhakarna&quot; 
* &quot;Merangiria&quot; 
* &quot;Ohigginsia&quot; 
* &quot;Pseudopassadena&quot; 
* &quot;Psorozophera&quot; 
These genera have been placed in the Pyralidae when these were still circumscribed &quot;sensu lato&quot; and are sometimes still treated thus, but actually they seem to belong in the Crambidae (see also &quot;Micronix&quot; and &quot;Tanaobela&quot;):
* &quot;Alphacrambus&quot; 
* &quot;Peniculimius&quot; 
* &quot;Steneromene&quot; 
* &quot;Thopeutis&quot; 
* &quot;Yoshiyasua&quot; (formerly &quot;Melanochroa&quot; )

<text>Ian Reginald Edward Gow (; 11 February 1937Â â 30 July 1990) was a British politician and solicitor. As a member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastbourne from 1974, until he was assassinated in 1990 by a car bomb planted by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) outside his home in East Sussex.

==Early life==
Ian Reginald Edward Gow was born at 3 Upper Harley Street, London on Thursday 11 February 1937. He was the son of Alexander Edward Gow, a London doctor attached to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital who died in September 1952. Ian Gow was educated at Winchester College, where he was president of the debating society. During a period of national service from 1955 to 1958 he was commissioned in the 15th/19th Hussars and served in Northern Ireland, Germany and Malaya. He subsequently served in the territorial army until 1976, attaining the rank of major.

After completing national service he took up a career in the law and qualified as a solicitor in 1962. He eventually became a partner in the London practice of Joynson-Hicks and Co. He also became a Conservative Party activist. He stood for Parliament in the Coventry East constituency for the 1964 general election, but lost to Richard Crossman. He then stood for the Clapham constituency, a Labour-held London marginal seat, in the 1966 general election. An account in &quot;The Times&quot; of his candidature described him in the following terms: &quot;He is a bachelor solicitor, aged 29, wearing his public school manner as prominently as his rosette. Words such as &#x27;overpowering&#x27;, &#x27;arrogant&#x27;, and &#x27;bellicose&#x27; are used to describe him.&quot;

After failing to take Clapham, he continued his quest to find a seat. He eventually succeeded at Eastbourne in 1972 after the local Party de-selected its sitting member, Charles Taylor. Taylor had represented Eastbourne since 1935 and did not take kindly to Gow.

==Parliamentary career==
Gow entered the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Eastbourne in the general election of February 1974. For a home in his constituency, Gow acquired a 16th-century manor house known as The Doghouse in the village of Hankham. Eastbourne was then a safe Conservative seat, and Gow always had a majority share of the vote during his time as MP. In the general election of October 1974, he secured a 10% swing from Liberal to Conservative, doubling his majority.

In the 1975 Conservative leadership election, Gow voted for Margaret Thatcher in the first round ballot. Once Thatcher had forced Edward Heath out of the contest, several new candidates appeared and Gow switched his support to Geoffrey Howe in the second round, which Thatcher won. Gow was brought onto the Conservative front bench in 1978 to share the duties of opposition spokesman on Northern Ireland with Airey Neave. The two men developed a Conservative policy on Northern Ireland which favoured closer ties with Great Britain in order to further integrate the region. This approach appeared to avoid compromise with the Northern Ireland&#x27;s nationalist minority and with the government of the Republic of Ireland. Both Neave and Gow were killed by car bomb attacks in 1979 and 1990 respectively. Irish republican paramilitaries claimed responsibility in both cases.

Through his association with Neave, Gow was introduced to the inner circles of the Conservative Party. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Margaret Thatcher in May 1979 at the time she became Prime Minister. While serving in this capacity between 1979 and 1983, Gow became a close friend and confidante of the Prime Minister. He was deeply involved in the workings of Thatcher&#x27;s private office until his departure in June 1983. Though elevated to junior ministerial office as Minister for Housing and Construction before moving later to the Treasury, Gow was known to be disappointed by his loss of influence with the Prime Minister in his new role. In late-1983, he developed plans with Alan Clark to reinvigorate Thatcher&#x27;s private office by expanding it and its influence over policy, thereby creating a new role for himself; but these came to nothing.

After 1979 Gow shared an office with Michael Brown. Although identified with the right-wing of his party, he took a liberal position on some issues. He visited Rhodesia at the time of its Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and was subsequently critical of the country&#x27;s white minority regime. As an MP, Gow consistently voted against the restoration of the death penalty. As Minister of State for Housing and Construction (from 1983 to June 1985) he showed a willingness to commit public funds to housing projects that alarmed some on the right-wing of the Conservative Party. &quot;After taking what was perhaps too principled a stand in a complex dispute over Housing Improvement Grants, he was moved sideways to the post of minister of state at the Treasury&quot;.

From 1982, Conservative Party policy began to move towards a more flexible position on Northern Ireland. In November 1985, Gow was persuaded by the speeches of his cousin Nicholas Budgen to resign as Minister of State in HM Treasury over the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Despite his disagreement with government policy, he used his resignation speech to underline his personal devotion to Thatcher, describing her as &quot;the finest chief, the most resolute leader, the kindest friend that any member of this House could hope to serve.&quot; The Anglo-Irish Agreement would ultimately lead to devolved government for Northern Ireland, power sharing in the province and engagement with the Republic. After his resignation from the government, Gow became chairman of the parliamentary Conservative backbench committee on Northern Ireland. He was a leading opponent of any compromise with republicans and his tactics in this regard caused concern to the Northern Ireland Secretary Jim Prior and other MPs. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;He [Gow] co-ordinated the Tory backbench opposition to Mr Prior&#x27;s Northern Ireland Assembly bill in the early 1980s. His activities were said to have startled other Tory MPs and led to a complaint from an enraged Mr Prior to Mrs Thatcher.&quot;

Although he was opposed to the broadcasting of Parliamentary debates, on 21 November 1989, he delivered the first televised speech in the House of Commons. Until 1989, television cameras did not show proceedings in the House of Commons, although it had been discussed eight times between 1964 and 1989. In 1988, MPs backed an experiment with cameras in the chamber, and House of Commons proceedings were televised for the first time on 21 November 1989. Technically, Gow was not the first MP to appear on camera in the chamber, as Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, raised a point of order before Gow presented the Loyal Address at the opening of Parliament. In his speech, Gow referred to a letter he had received from a firm of consultants who had offered to improve his personal appearance and television image, making a few self-deprecating jokes about his baldness. MPs agreed in 1990 to make the experiment permanent.

In spite of his disagreement with the direction in which Government policy on Northern Ireland was moving, Gow remained on close terms with Thatcher. In November 1989, he worked in Thatcher&#x27;s leadership election campaign against the stalking horse candidate, Sir Anthony Meyer. But it was reported that by the time of his death he believed Thatcher&#x27;s premiership had reached a logical end and that she should retire. Gow enjoyed friendships with people of various political persuasions, including left-wing Labour MP Tony Banks. Alan Clark described him as &quot;my closest friend by far in politics&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gow married Jane Elizabeth Packe (born 1944) in Yorkshire on 10 September 1966. They had two sons.

==Assassination==
Although aware that he was a potential IRA target, unlike most British MPs of that era Gow left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory and in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;. He never checked under his car for bombs. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow&#x27;s Austin Montego car, which was parked in the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. Gow died 10 minutes later as emergency workers removed him from the wreckage of his car.

Upon hearing of Gow&#x27;s death, Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock commented, &quot;This is a terrible atrocity against a man whose only offence was to speak his mind... I had great disagreement with Ian Gow and he with me, but no one can doubt his sincerity or his courage, and it is appalling that he should lose his life because of these qualities.&quot; In her autobiography, &quot;The Downing Street Years&quot;, Margaret Thatcher described his murder as an &quot;irreplaceable loss&quot;.

The IRA claimed responsibility for killing Gow, stating that he was targeted because he was a &quot;close personal associate&quot; of Thatcher and because of his role in developing British policy on Northern Ireland. Nobody was ever charged with causing his death and claims were reported by journalist Paul Routledge concerning possible involvement of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and intelligence community.

==Aftermath==
Evaluations of Gow&#x27;s political career by obituarists were mixed in tone. All commented on his personal charm and his skills in public speaking and political manoeuvre. But his obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; stated, &quot;It could not be said that his resignation in 1985 cut short a brilliant ministerial career&quot;. A tendency towards political intrigue (for example, trying to covertly undermine Jim Prior&#x27;s Northern Ireland initiative after 1982) made him enemies. Nicholas Budgen commented that Gow&#x27;s personal devotion to Thatcher may not have been good for Thatcher or her government.

Gow&#x27;s widow Jane was appointed a DBE in 1990 and thus became Dame Jane Gow. On 4 February 1994, she remarried in West Somerset to Lt-Col. Michael Whiteley, and became known as Dame Jane Whiteley. She continues to promote the life and work of her first husband.

When the Eastbourne by-election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat David Bellotti, the Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe sent a message to voters saying &quot;Bellotti is the innocent beneficiary of murder. I suspect that last night as the Liberal Democrats were toasting their success, in its hideouts the IRA were doing the same thing&quot;.

<text>Bilbeis (Â ; Bohairic &#x27;) is an ancient [[fortress]] city on the eastern edge of the southern [[Nile delta|Nile Delta]] in [[Egypt]], the site of the ancient city and former bishopric ofPhelbes and a Latin Catholic titular see.

The city is small in size but densely populated, with over 407,300 residents. It also houses the Egyptian Air Force Academy complex, which contains the town&#x27;s largest public school in Al-Zafer.

Coptic tradition says that Bilbeis was one of the stopping places of the Holy Family during the Flight into Egypt.

== History ==
The city was important enough in the Roman province of Augustamnica Secunda to become a bishopric.

Situated on a caravan and natural invasion route from the east, Bilbeis was conquered in 640 by the Arabs. Amr ibn al-As besieged and took the city defended by a Byzantine general called al-Ardubun. According to a Muslim legend, Armanusa, the daughter of Muqawqis lived in Bilbeis. In 727 some of the Qays tribe were resettled here and later chain of fortresses was built to protect Cairo.

The city played a role in the machinations for control of the Fatimid vizierate: first in 1164, when Shirkuh was besieged in the city by the combined forces of Shawar and crusader king Amalric I of Jerusalem for three months; then again in 1168 when the city was assaulted again by Amalric&#x27;s army, who took the city after three days on 4 November and indiscriminately killed the inhabitants. (See Crusader invasion of Egypt.)

In 1798, its fortifications were rebuilt at the order of Napoleon.

Bilbays Air Base, an Egyptian Air Force base is nearby.

<text>OpenTTD is a business simulation game in which players try to earn money by transporting passengers, minerals and goods via road, rail, water and air. It is an open-source remake and expansion of the 1995 Chris Sawyer video game &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;.

&quot;OpenTTD&quot; duplicates most features of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; and has many additions, including a range of map sizes, support for many languages, custom (user-made) artificial intelligence (AI), downloadable customisations, ports for several widely used operating systems, and a more user-friendly interface. &quot;OpenTTD&quot; also supports local area network (LAN) and Internet multiplayer, co-operative and competitive, for up to 255 players.

&quot;OpenTTD&quot; is free and open-source software licensed under the GNU GPL-2-0-only and is under ongoing development. According to a study of the 61,154 open-source projects on SourceForge in the period between 1999 and 2005, &quot;OpenTTD&quot; ranked as the 8th most active open-source project to receive patches and contributions. In 2004, development moved to their own server.
Since 2018, the project uses GitHub for its source repository and bug tracker. Starting from April 1, 2021, the game is now also available on Steam.

The development of &quot;OpenTTD&quot; was driven by the desire to extend the abilities of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; to support user-made additions to the graphics and gameplay, as well as the desires of users to play the game on more modern operating systems and alternative computer architectures which the original game (released in 1994 for DOS and programmed in assembly language) did not support.

===Prior modifications to &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;===
There was a prior attempt to modify Transport Tycoon Deluxe to run on more modern operating systems. &quot;OpenTTD&quot; was preceded by a commercial conversion of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; to run on Windows 95. It was created in 1996 by the FISH technology group, but Nola released in 1999 as part of a compilation of older &quot;Tycoon&quot; games. This release was still greatly restricted in operating systems and computer architectures it could run on.

Similarly, there was an earlier success aiming to open &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; to modification by users. &quot;TTDPatch&quot;, initially created by Josef Drexler in 1996â97 and still being developed in 2010, changes the behaviour of &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; as it is running, to introduce many new features to the game, such as new graphics, vehicles, industries, etc. &quot;TTDPatch&quot; is restricted by the same operating system and computer architecture limits as &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; and has limited control over what features of the game can be altered.

===Initial development of &quot;OpenTTD&quot;===
In 2003, Ludvig Strigeus announced that he intended to reverse engineer &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; and convert the game to C. On March 6, 2004, this re-engineered &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot; was released and named &quot;OpenTTD&quot;. , &quot;OpenTTD&quot; is still under active development.

The early development of &quot;OpenTTD&quot; focused on restructuring the code to improve readability and extensibility. This allowed restoring features like sound and music, improving the user interface and introducing new languages for the GUI. Many new gameplay features and possibilities for user modification were also added around this time, aiming to replicate the abilities of TTDPatch. A major improvement was reprogramming multiplayer (network games) to use the Internet Protocol, allowing multiplayer gaming online and over modern LANs.

By the late 2000s, &quot;OpenTTD&quot; was a stable and popular game and development moved toward more substantial changes. 2007 saw the development of support for custom, user-made AIs, which can provide players with more of a challenge than the original AI. Other more major changes included introducing support for IPv6, an integrated download system for user-made customisations, and support for alternative base graphics, sound and music sets in 2009. Since 2007, &quot;OpenTTD&quot; is gradually being rewritten in C++.

==Gameplay==

&quot;OpenTTD&quot; gameplay is very similar to &quot;Transport Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, on which it is based, although there are many improvements in both options within the game and ease of use. 
A player&#x27;s aim is to build a transportation network using trucks, buses, trains, airplanes and boats to link together industries and towns on the map and transport the cargo they produce. Every time a vehicle makes a delivery of some cargo, players receive an income, allowing them to build more infrastructure (rails, stations, etc.), build more vehicles, modify the terrain, and interact with towns, via their local authorities. The default game runs from 1950 to 2050, during which a player aims to get as high a performance rating (based on number of vehicles, income, amount of cargo delivered, etc.) as possible.

The world map is dotted with both industries and towns. Cargo for transportation is supplied by both industries (e.g. the coal mine which produces coal) and towns (which produce passengers and mail) and accepted by other industries and/or towns according to their needs (e.g., the power station accepts coal). Placing a station near a source and a receiver of a certain cargo allows transportation between the two. The amount of cargo supplied by a town or industry depends on the quality of transport players provide to move its goods. Payment for delivering cargo depends on the quantity of cargo delivered, how fast it was delivered and how perishable it is. Some cargoes (e.g., passengers) must be delivered faster than others (e.g., coal) to earn a good income.
During the course of the game, players must build and expand their transport infrastructure. The only infrastructure present on the map at the start of the game are roads within towns (as well as seas and rivers which ships can utilise). All other infrastructureâports, stations, airports, rail, canals, locks, aqueducts and depotsâmust be built by players. The tools for building a rail network are particularly powerful, and players have access to many different signal types to build a complex and interconnected rail network.

Technology improvements give players access to newer, faster and more powerful vehicles. For rail transport, new track technology also becomes available over time, first electrified rail, then monorail and maglev track. In general, newer vehicles cost more money to buy and run, and players must have earned enough money in earlier stages of the game to be able to afford to upgrade their vehicles. The full course of the default game, from 1950 to 2050, takes around 24 hours. Players can optionally start at earlier or later dates and play on past 2050, although no new technology becomes available.

&quot;OpenTTD&quot; can be played by one player, against a computer controlled AI, or by many players against each other, over a LAN or the Internet.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;OpenTTD&quot; supports multiplayer games for up to 255 players between 15 different transport companies, and can be played both over a LAN or over the Internet. Each transport company is in competition with each other transport company, and each transport company can be controlled by more than one player at any time. This allows both co-operative and competitive multiplayer games. Competitive team games (e.g. two transport companies, each controlled by three players) are also possible.

===Modding===
The game is also home to an active modding community, with community-made additions including new vehicles, trains and scenarios. Additional changes to the open source code which modify core game mechanics (&quot;patches&quot;) are also available.

==Reception==
OpenTTD has been praised for the number of improvements it has made to the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe, such as the AI, graphics, sounds, and ability to play multiplayer.
OpenTTD received the most votes for Game of the Year for the 2004 Amiga Games Award.
Lewis Denby from PC Gamer ranked OpenTTD 20th in its May 2011 list of best free PC games.
Hungarian Unix Portal users chose &quot;OpenTTD&quot; as favourite (free) game in 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010. In 2014 &quot;OpenTTD&quot; was named by PCGamer among the &quot;Ten top fan remade classics you can play for free right now&quot;.
In 2015 and 2016, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked &quot;OpenTTD&quot; 8th on its The 50 Best Free Games on PC list.

<doc id="703314" wikidata="Q1344835" url="?curid=703314" title="Hyperparathyroidism">
<text>Hyperparathyroidism is an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood. This occurs from a disorder either within the parathyroid glands (primary hyperparathyroidism) or as response to external stimuli (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Symptoms of hyperparathyroidism are caused by inappropriately normal or elevated blood calcium excreted from the bones and flowing into the blood stream in response to increased production of parathyroid hormone. In healthy people, when blood calcium levels are high, parathyroid hormone levels should be low. With long-standing hyperparathyroidism, the most common symptom is kidney stones. Other symptoms may include bone pain, weakness, depression, confusion, and increased urination. Both primary and secondary may result in osteoporosis (weakening of the bones).

In 80% of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a single benign tumor known as a parathyroid adenoma. Most of the remainder are due to several of these adenomas. Very rarely it may be due to parathyroid cancer. Secondary hyperparathyroidism typically occurs due to vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, or other causes of low blood calcium. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made by finding elevated calcium and PTH in the blood.
Primary hyperparathyroidism may only be cured by removing the adenoma or overactive parathyroid glands. In asymptomatic patients who present with mildly elevated blood calcium levels, with otherwise normal kidneys, and with normal bone density, monitoring may be all that is required. The medication cinacalcet may also be used to decrease PTH levels in those unable to have surgery although it is not a cure. In patients with very high blood calcium levels, treatment may include large amounts of intravenous normal saline. Low vitamin D should be corrected in those with secondary hyperparathyroidism but low Vitamin D pre-surgery is controversial for those with primary hyperparathyroidism. Low vitamin D levels should be corrected post-parathyroidectomy.
==Signs and symptoms==
In primary hyperparathyroidism, about 75% of people are &quot;asymptomatic&quot;. While most primary patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, &#x27;asymptomatic&#x27; is poorly defined and represents only those without &quot;obvious clinical sequelae&quot; such as kidney stones, bone disease, or hypercalcemic crisis. These &quot;asymptomatic&quot; patients may have other symptoms such as depression, anxiety, gastrointestinal distress, and neuromuscular problems that are not counted as symptoms. The problem is often picked up incidentally during blood work for other reasons, and the test results show a higher amount of calcium in the blood than normal. Many people only have non-specific symptoms.

Common manifestations of hypercalcemia include constipation, vomiting, weakness, lethargy, fatigue, depression, bone pain, muscle soreness (myalgias), joint pain, decreased appetite, feelings of nausea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, polyuria, polydipsia, cognitive impairment, kidney stones (), vertigo and osteopenia or osteoporosis. A history of acquired racquet nails (brachyonychia) may be indicative of bone resorption. Radiographically, hyperparathyroidism has a pathognomic finding of rugger jersey spine. Parathyroid adenomas are very rarely detectable on clinical examination. Surgical removal of a parathyroid tumor eliminates the symptoms in most patients.

In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to lack of vitamin D absorption, the parathyroid gland is behaving normally; clinical problems are due to bone resorption and manifest as bone syndromes such as rickets, osteomalacia, and renal osteodystrophy.

==Causes==
Causes of primary hyperparathyroidism include parathyroid adenoma (80% of patients), multiglandular disease usually seen as hyperplasia of the 4 parathyroid glands (15-20% of patients), parathyroid carcinoma (less than 1% of patients). Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs sporadically and most patients do not have a family history. Radiation exposure increases the risk of primary hyperparathyroidism. Additional risk factors include lithium and thiazide diuretics exposure. A number of genetic conditions including multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism also increase the risk. Parathyroid adenomas have been linked with DDT although a causal link has not yet been established. The most common causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism include vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, inadequate calcium intake, malabsorption. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism most commonly occurs from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism.

== Development ==
The parathyroid is composed of 4 glands with 2 located superiorly and 2 located inferiorly. The parathyroid glands are located on the posterior thyroid and are derived from the endoderm of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches. Specifically, the inferior parathyroid glands are derived from the 3rd pharyngeal pouch and the superior parathyroid glands are derived from the 4th pharyngeal pouch dorsal wing. The ultimopharyngeal body is derived from the 4th pharyngeal pouch ventral wing and the parafollicular cells ( C-cells) are derived when the ultimopharyngeal bodies fuse with the posterolateral thyroid. The parathyroid glands separates from the pharyngeal wall and attaches to the posterior thyroid during the 7th week of human embryonic development.

==Mechanism==
Normal parathyroid glands measure the ionized calcium (Ca2+) concentration in the blood and secrete parathyroid hormone accordingly; if the ionized calcium rises above normal, the secretion of PTH is decreased, whereas when the Ca2+ level falls, parathyroid hormone secretion is increased.

=== Regulation of PTH ===
Rapid PTH regulation is controlled by the parathyroid G-protein coupled, calcium sensing receptors which responds to fluctuations in serum calcium levels. Alternatively, prolonged changes in serum calcium influences mRNA-binding proteins altering the encoding of PTH mRNA. There are also calcium independent mechanisms which include repression of PTH transcription through 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D binding with the vitamin D receptor. Furthermore, 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also has an impact on the expression of calcium-sensing receptors, indirectly affecting PTH secretion.

Effects of PTH on the Bones

PTH stimulates the bones to release calcium through multiple mechanisms. 1) PTH stimulates osteoblasts which increase expression of RANKL which causes differentiation of the osteoblasts into osteocytes. 2) PTH inhibits secretion of osteoprotegerina to allow for osteoclast differentiation. 3) PTH will also directly activate osteoclasts to cause bone resorption through degradation of hydroxyapatite and organic material. This then causes bone to release calcium into the blood.

Effects of PTH on the Kidneys

Calcium reabsorption in the nephron occurs in proximal convoluted tubule and at the ascending Loop of Henle. PTH acts on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to increase calcium reabsorption in the nephron. PTH also acts on the proximal convoluted tubule to decrease phosphate reabsorption to lower the serum phosphate. This decreases formation of insoluble calcium phosphate salts leading to an increase in serum ionized calcium.

Effects of PTH on the Small Intestines

PTH stimulates the production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the proximal convoluted tubule. This enzyme activation hydroxylates inactive 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to active vitamin D (1, 25 dihydroxycholecalciferol). Active vitamin D allows for calcium absorption through transcellular and paracellular pathways.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs if the calcium level is abnormally low. The normal glands respond by secreting parathyroid hormone at a persistently high rate. This typically occurs when the 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels in the blood are low and hypocalcemia is present. A lack of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 can result from a deficient dietary intake of vitamin D, or from a lack of exposure of the skin to sunlight, so the body cannot make its own vitamin D from cholesterol. The resulting hypovitaminosis D is usually due to a partial combination of both factors. Vitamin D3 (or cholecalciferol) is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (or calcidiol) by the liver, from where it is transported via the circulation to the kidneys, and it is converted into the active hormone, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, a third cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic kidney disease. Here the ability to manufacture 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 is compromised, resulting in hypocalcemia.

==Diagnosis==
The gold standard of diagnosis is the PTH immunoassay. Once an elevated PTH has been confirmed, the goal of diagnosis is to determine the type of hyperparathyroidism (primary, secondary, or tertiary hyperparathyroidism) by obtaining a serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels.

Primary hyperparathyroidism has high calcium, vitamin D, and PTH levels and a low phosphate level. Secondary hyperparathyroidism has low serum calcium and vitamin D levels, and high phosphate and PTH levels. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism has high serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH and low vitamin D levels. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is differentiated from primary hyperparathyroidism by a history of chronic kidney failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Hyperparathyroidism can cause hyperchloremia and increase renal bicarbonate loss, which may result in a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. ALP level can be elevated due to bone turnover. Additionally further tests can be completed to rule out other causes and complications of hyperparathyroidism including a 24-hour urinary calcium for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, DEXA scan to evaluate for osteoporosis, osteopenia, or fragility fractures, and genetic testing. Additionally a CT scan without contrast or renal ultrasound can be done to assess for nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis if there is concern for it.

===Differential diagnosis===
Differential diagnoses of hypercalcemia include humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, renal failure, malignant bone destruction (such as multiple myeloma, metastatic breast cancer, lymphoma), thiazide diuretics, lithium, immobilization, hyperthyroidism, milk alkali syndrome, multiple endocrine adenomatosis syndromes, and granulomatous diseases. Additionally, familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcamia can present with similar lab changes. In this condition, the calcium creatinine clearance ratio, however, is typically under 0.01 due to the low levels urine calcium.

===Blood tests===
====Intact PTH====
In primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are either elevated or &quot;inappropriately normal&quot; in the presence of elevated calcium. Typically, PTH levels vary greatly over time in the affected patient and (as with Ca and Ca++ levels) must be retested several times to see the pattern. The currently accepted test for PTH is &quot;intact PTH&quot;, which detects only relatively intact and biologically active PTH molecules. Older tests often detected other, inactive fragments. Even intact PTH may be inaccurate in patients with kidney dysfunction. Intact PTH blood tests may be falsely low if biotin has been ingested in the previous few days prior to the blood test.

====Calcium levels====
In cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, heightened PTH leads to increased serum calcium (hypercalcemia) due to:
# increased bone resorption, allowing the flow of calcium from bone to blood
# reduced kidney clearance of calcium
# increased intestinal calcium absorption

====Serum phosphate====
In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum phosphate levels are abnormally low as a result of decreased reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney tubules. However, this is only present in about 50% of cases. This contrasts with secondary hyperparathyroidism and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, in which serum phosphate levels are generally elevated because of kidney disease.

====Alkaline phosphatase====
Alkaline phosphatase levels are usually high in hyperparathyroidism due to high bone turn over. In primary hyperparathyroidism, levels may remain within the normal range, but this is inappropriately normal given the increased levels of plasma calcium.

===Nuclear medicine===
Nuclear medicine imaging methods are used by surgeons to locate which parathyroid gland is responsible for hyperparathyroidism or to find ectopic parathyroid adenomas, most commonly found in the anterior mediastinum. Historically, technetium sestamibi scintigraphy was the main method used or this indication. Recently 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT tend to be more and more performed due to excellent diagnostic performance.

===Classification===

====Primary====

Primary hyperparathyroidism results from a hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands themselves. The oversecretion of PTH is due to a parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, or rarely, a parathyroid carcinoma. This disease is often characterized by the quartet &quot;stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric overtones&quot; referring to the presence of kidney stones, hypercalcemia, constipation, and peptic ulcers, as well as depression, respectively.

In a minority of cases, this occurs as part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, either type 1 (caused by a mutation in the gene &quot;MEN1&quot;) or type 2a (caused by a mutation in the gene &quot;RET&quot;), which is also associated with the adrenal tumor pheochromocytoma. Other mutations that have been linked to parathyroid neoplasia include mutations in the genes &quot;HRPT2&quot; and &quot;CASR&quot;.

Patients with bipolar disorder who are receiving long-term lithium treatment are at increased risk for hyperparathyroidism. Elevated calcium levels are found in 15% to 20% of patients who have been taking lithium long-term. However, only a few of these patients have significantly elevated levels of parathyroid hormone and clinical symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a single parathyroid adenoma.

====Secondary====
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is due to physiological (i.e. appropriate) secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels). The most common causes are vitamin D deficiency (caused by lack of sunlight, diet or malabsorption) and chronic kidney failure. Vitamin D deficiency can result from malabsorption or decreased vitamin D intake such as with gastric bypass, small bowel disease, pancreatic disease, and dietary causes. Other causes include decreased skin synthesis of vitamin D such as decreased exposure to sunlight and skin disorders. Insufficient vitamin D synthesis such as defective 25-hydroxylation, 1-alpha hydroxylase, and 1-alpha 25-hydroxylation can also contribute to vitamin D deficiency.

Lack of vitamin D leads to reduced calcium absorption by the intestine leading to hypocalcemia and increased parathyroid hormone secretion. This increases bone resorption. In chronic kidney failure the problem is more specifically failure to convert vitamin D to its active form in the kidney. The bone disease in secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by kidney failure is termed renal osteodystrophy.

====Tertiary====
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is seen in those with long-term secondary hyperparathyroidism, which eventually leads to hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands and a loss of response to serum calcium levels. This disorder is most often seen in patients with end-stage kidney disease and is an autonomous activity. Patients with late-stage kidney disease have an increased likelihood of developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism if not promptly corrected. In patients with late-stage kidney disease phosphate levels are elevated which directly affects the parathyroid glands and increases PTH production. Additionally, studies have shown that even in the absence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, those with X-Linked hypophosphatemia rickets who are on phosphate treatment are more susceptible to developing tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the type of hyperparathyroidism encountered.

===Primary===
Parathyroidectomy is a curative therapy for symptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, it decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, fragility fractures, and improves bone mineral density. Studies have also found that parathyroidectomy for hyperparathyroidism improves fatigue, weakness, depression, and memory. While parathyroidectomy is recommended for all patients with hyperparathyroidism who are symptomatic, indications of surgery for those who are asymptomatic include the following:
* Asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism with any of the following:
** 24-hour urinary calcium &gt;250Â mg/day in women and &gt;300Â mg/day in men (see footnote, below)
** serum calcium &gt; 1Â mg/dl above upper limit of normal
** Creatinine clearance &gt; 30% below normal for patient&#x27;s age
** Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2
** Bone density &gt; 2.5 standard deviations below peak (i.e., T-score of â2.5)
** People age &lt; 50
** Nephrolithiasis seen on imaging (ultrasound or CT)

A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared the surgical procedures of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy and classically used bilateral neck exploration, however it did not find one approach to be superior to the other in either benefits or risks.

Surgery can rarely result in hypoparathyroidism.

===Secondary===
In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, the high PTH levels are an appropriate response to low calcium and treatment must be directed at the underlying cause of this (usually vitamin D deficiency or chronic kidney failure). If this is successful, PTH levels return to normal levels, unless PTH secretion has become autonomous (tertiary hyperparathyroidism). Hyperphosphatemia may be treated by decreasing dietary intake of phosphate. If phosphate remains persistently elevated above 5.5Â mg/dL with dietary restriction, then phosphate binders may be used. Vitamin D deficiency may be treated with vitamin D supplementation. However in patients with chronic kidney disease, patients should not receive vitamin D supplementation if they are elevated serum phosphate levels or have hypercalcemia.

=== Tertiary ===
Parathyroidectomy is indicated in tertiary hyperparathyroidism for patients who have severe osteopenia, severe persistent hypercalcemia (&gt;11.0Â mg/ dL), calciphylaxis, bone pain, or pathological fracture. A systematic review found surgical treatment to be superior regarding cure rates than medical therapy with cinacalcet with lower risk of complications.

===Calcimimetics===
A calcimimetic (such as cinacalcet) is a potential therapy for some people with severe hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy, and for secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis. Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with a calcimimetic in those on dialysis for CKD does not alter the risk of early death; however, it does decrease the likelihood of needing a parathyroidectomy. Treatment carries the risk of low blood calcium levels and vomiting.

== Epidemiology ==
In the developed world, between one and four per thousand people are affected. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common type. Certain exposures increase the risk of developing primary hyperparathyroidism such as sex and age. It occurs three times more often in women than men and is often diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 60 but is not uncommon before then. The disease was first described in the 1700s. In the late 1800s, it was determined to be related to the parathyroid. Surgery as a treatment was first carried out in 1925. The United States prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism from 2010 was 233 per 100,000 women and 85 per 100,000 men. Black and white women aged 70â79 have the highest overall prevalence. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by chronic kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is about 50% of the world population and chronic kidney disease prevalence is 15% of the United States population.

==History==
The oldest known case was found in a cadaver from an Early Neolithic cemetery in southwest Germany.

<doc id="703338" wikidata="Q173189" url="?curid=703338" title="Coat of arms of Slovenia">
<text>The coat of arms of Slovenia is an emblem that consists of a red bordered blue shield on which there is a stylised white Mount Triglav, under which there are two wavy lines representing the sea and the rivers of the country. Above Mount Triglav, there are three golden six-pointed stars representing the Counts of Celje. It was designed in 1991 by Marko PogaÄnik and adopted on 24 June 1991.

== History ==
=== Habsburg dynasty ===
Historically the modern-day territory of Slovenia consisted of a number of historical lands and territories which were eventually all ruled by the Austrian House of Habsburg. 
Until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Slovene Lands did not have a coat of arms representing the whole nation; instead, (most of) the constituent lands had their own coats of arms:

*Windic March, later part of the County of Cilli
*County of Cilli, later part of the Duchy of Carniola
*Duchy of Carniola
*southern Duchy of Carinthia
*Lower Duchy of Styria
*Slovene March in the Vas county of the Kingdom of Hungary, with the adjacent zones of the Zala county (Beltinci, TurniÅ¡Äe, Velika Polana, Kobilje)
* County of Gorizia and Gradisca, later part of the Austrian Littoral
* Istria (in the modern municipalities of Koper, Izola, Piran, Hrpelje-Kozina, Muggia and Dolina), part of the Austrian Littoral

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
When the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with Kingdom of Serbia, Slovenia had its first real coat of arms, which actually was a heavily modified one from the Serbian Kingdom. The coat of arms presents the Serbian shield with white cross on the left, the Croatian shield on the right and under both there is a blue shield representing Slovenes. An image of the royal Yugoslav coat of arms can be seen on the 10-Yugoslav dinar banknote of 1926.

===Socialist Republic of Slovenia===
The emblem of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia was designed by Branko SimÄiÄ on the basis of the symbol of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation. It is in the style of socialist emblem of other communist nations. The sea and the mount Triglav motive appeared in the emblem of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, one of six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The former emblem was rounded by wheat with linden leaves and featured a red star at the top. There was also the other emblem which presented Yugoslavia as a whole.

===Republic of Slovenia===
A tender for the design of a new coat of arms of Slovenia was published in May 1991. It was won by Marko PogaÄnik, whose design was meant to represent Slovenia as a macroregional entity, and to follow in the footsteps of the poet France PreÅ¡eren and the architect JoÅ¾e PleÄnik: the arms reflect the description of nature in PreÅ¡eren&#x27;s 19th-century epic &quot;The Baptism on the Savica&quot;, and are based on PleÄnik&#x27;s informal 1934 proposal for a new coat of arms of Slovenia (in the from of a pillar dedicated to the Virgin Mary outside the parish church of Bled.)

PogaÄnik&#x27;s design was proclaimed the new official coat of arms of Slovenia with the constitutional amendment C 100, which took effect on 24 June 1991.

===Historical symbols===
==Symbolics==

The designer, Marko PogaÄnik, has described the coat of arms as a cosmogram, whose purpose is to create an &quot;energetic field&quot; intended to protect the country and stimulate its inner potential.

According to PogaÄnik, the silhouette of mount Triglav symbolises the male principle, while the two wavy lines below it - representing the Triglav Lakes Valley, the Slovene seacoast, and rivers in general - symbolise the female principle. The three golden mullets above Triglav, taken from the coat of arms of the Counts of Celje, symbolize democracy.

==Legal status==
As a work of arts, published in the official journal &quot;Official Gazette&quot;, the national coat of arms of Slovenia qualifies as an official work and is per Article 9 of the Slovene Copyright and Related Rights Act not protected by the copyrights. Its usage is regulated by the &quot;Act Regulating the Coat-of-Arms, Flag and Anthem of the Republic of Slovenia and the Flag of the Slovene Nation&quot;, published in the Official Gazette in 1994.

==Criticism==
The coat of arms has been criticized by Aleksander HribovÅ¡ek of the Heraldica Slovenica society as heraldically deficient: Mount Triglav (whose choice as a national symbol he questions) and the sea are not represented according to heraldic rules, and the overall arms have no official blazon; the form of shield used is also not heraldically recognised.

<text>The X-Treme Sanctions Executive is a fictional paramilitary police force appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, in particular those featuring the X-Men, and related spinoffs. The organization is charged with keeping the peace between mutants and humans in the Marvel Comics universe. The team was first mentioned in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #40, when Storm presents her team with an offer to join a new, government-backed squad, and debuts in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #445 (August 2004).

==Publication history==
During the final issues of &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, Storm successfully campaigns the United Nations for a team that would be backed by the United Nations that would have legal authority to enforce peace between mutants and humans. The X-Treme Sanctions Executive, also known by the abbreviation XSE, debuts in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #445, following the return of writer Chris Claremont. Artists Alan Davis and Chris Bachalo illustrate several of the team&#x27;s adventures.

Several former X-Treme X-Men members join the group, including Sage, Bishop and Cannonball, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and Rachel Summers, aka Marvel Girl.

While in England visiting Brian Braddock, the brother of the recently-slain X-Man Psylocke, Marvel Girl, Cannonball and Bishop are attacked by a Fury. Sage is able to construct a plan to defeat The Fury, however Cannonball is forced to take a leave of absence to recuperate from his injuries. Afterwards, they deal with a murderous plot by crime kingpin from Madripoor, Viper. Sage subsequently rejoins the Hellfire Club in order to monitor its new Lord Imperial, and former X-Men charge Roberto da Costa, to ensure he is not corrupted by power, as Sabastian Shaw was.

After taking a resurrected Psylocke into custody, the team later visits the Savage Land, where Rachel is subjected to the mind-control of a tribe of advanced humanoid dinosaur people, the Hauk&#x27;ka, causing her to believe she belonged to their species. She then subconsciously uses her telekinesis to alter her own genome in their image. The Hauk&#x27;ka&#x27;s seek to use Storm&#x27;s power to control the weather to destroy humanity. When her powers become unstable, the Hauk&#x27;ka and the XSE are forced to work together to stop her from destroying the planet. After their mission is successful, the XSE made peace with Hauk&#x27;ka, and Rachel is released from their mind control.

Following the events of the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, and the decimation of the majority of the world&#x27;s mutant populace, the team shifts their attention to aiding the remaining mutant populace, liaising with the US Government&#x27;s O*N*E program. Storm chooses to work in Africa, to help the people of her native land.

<text>Chung Kuo is a series of science fiction novels written by David Wingrove. The novels present a future history of an Earth dominated by China.

==Setting==
&quot;Chung Kuo&quot; is primarily set 200 years in the future in mile-high, continent-spanning cities made of a super-plastic called &#x27;ice&#x27;. Housing a global population of 40 billion, the cities are divided into 300 levels and success and prestige is measured by how far above the ground one lives. Some â in the Above â live in great comfort. Others â in the Lowers â live in squalor, whilst at the bottom of the pile is &#x27;Below the Net&#x27;, a place where the criminal element is exiled and left to rot. Beneath the cities lie the ruins of old Earth â the Clay â a lightless, stygian hell in which, astonishingly, humans still exist. These divisions are known as &#x27;the world of levels&#x27;.

In addition to the world of levels, there are the great meat-animal pens and sprawling, vast plantations to feed the population. There is also activity beyond Earth. The ruling classes â who base their rule on the customs and fashions of imperial China â maintain traditional palaces and courts both on Earth and in geostationary orbit. There are also Martian research bases and the outer colonies, with their mining planets.

==Storyline==
At the very heart of &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; is the &#x27;War of Two Directions&#x27; â a struggle for the destiny of Mankind and the clash of two different ideologies. For the planet&#x27;s hereditary rulers, the T&#x27;angs, the goal is stability and security, at the expense of individual freedoms if necessary, while a commercially orientated faction desires change and the uncharted challenge of the new â even though loosening constraints on an over-populated planet could be lethal. Political tensions between the two factions lead to assassination, biological and nano-technological terrorism, and ultimately to war and the outright destruction of whole cities.

The story is told through the eyes of a wide variety of characters from all levels of society: Triad bosses and assassins, emperors and artists, courtesans and soldiers, scientists and thieves, terrorists and princes. By the end of the series the dramatis personae total several hundred characters â most of them dead by that point in the storyline.

==Publication history==
Originally published between 1988 and 1999, Wingrove planned the series as nine books (three trilogies), but after publication of the seventh volume Wingrove&#x27;s publisher insisted that the series be concluded in the next (eighth) volume, &quot;Marriage of the Living Dark&quot;.

In February 2011 Corvus / Atlantic Books began a re-release of the entire &quot;Chung Kuo&quot; saga, recasting it as twenty books with approximately 500,000 words of new material. This includes two brand new prequel novels, &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; (released February. 2011 in e-book and March 2011 in hardback) and &quot;Daylight on Iron Mountain&quot; and a significant restructuring of the end of the series to reflect Wingrove&#x27;s original intentions. The two prequels cover events between 2045 and 2100 AD, telling the story of China&#x27;s rise to power. In 2014, the re-release was discontinued after eight volumes.

On October 25, 2016, Wingrove announced that the publishing rights for the series had reverted to the author and that he planned to self-publish the entire 20-book series starting in 2017.

==Reception==
Reviews of the original eight-book series praised its scope and detailed worldbuilding, comparing it to Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series, James Clavell&#x27;s &quot;ShÅgun&quot; and Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared the series was &quot;one of the masterpieces of the decade&quot;. However, in 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that Wingrove&#x27;s vision of a Chinese-dominated future was unlikely and &quot;ungrounded in historical process&quot;. One reviewer felt the final volume was so &quot;nigh-incomprehensible&quot; that it warranted a review of &quot;a fake concluding novel&quot;.

<text>The Australian Army Reserve is a collective name given to the reserve units of the Australian Army. Since the Federation of Australia in 1901, the reserve military force has been known by many names, including the Citizens Forces, the Citizen Military Forces, the Militia and, unofficially, the Australian Military Forces. In 1980, however, the current nameâAustralian Army Reserveâwas officially adopted, and it now consists of a number of components based around the level of commitment and training obligation that its members are required to meet.

==Overview==
For the first half of the 20th century, due to a widespread distrust of permanent military forces in Australia, the reserve military forces were the primary focus of Australian military planning. Following the end of World War II, however, this focus gradually shifted due to the changing strategic environment, and the requirement for a higher readiness force available to support collective security goals. Since then, Australian defence policy has been focused more upon the Regular Army, and there has been considerable debate about the role of the Army Reserve within defence planning circles. As the strategic situation has evolved in the post Cold War era, the organisation, structure, training and role of the Army Reserve has undergone considerable changes, and members of the Army Reserve are increasingly being used on overseas deployments, not only within Regular Army units, but also in units drawn almost entirely from Reserve units.

Despite being the main focus upon which Australian defence planning was based, since Federation Reserve units have primarily been used in the role of home defence and to provide a mobilisation platform during times of war. During World War I Australia&#x27;s contribution to the fighting came from forces raised outside the citizen forces that were in existence at the time, and although many citizen soldiers enlisted in these forces, the Citizen Forces units remained in Australia. With the outbreak of World War II a similar situation evolved, with the establishment of an all-volunteer expeditionary force, however, with the entry of Japan into the war the threat to Australia became more direct and a number of Militia units were called upon to fight in New Guinea and other areas of the South West Pacific.

Following the end of World War II, however, the decision was made to establish a permanent standing defence force and the role of Reserve forces was reduced to the point where for a while their relevance was called into question. Recently, however, there has been a move to develop a more capable Reserve force, as Australia&#x27;s overseas military commitments in the Pacific and Middle East have highlighted the importance of the Reserves once more. As such, since 2000 units of the Australian Army Reserve have been deployed to East Timor and the Solomon Islands on peacekeeping duties and many more individual Reservists have been used to provide specialist capabilities and to fill in Regular Army formations being sent overseas.

==History==

===Federation to World War I===
Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, the amalgamation of the military forces controlled by the six separate, self-governing British colonies to form a unified force controlled by the Commonwealth was an inevitable, albeit slowly realised, consequence, given that the new Constitution of Australia assigned primary responsibility for defence to the Commonwealth. Indeed, this process took some time as, to a large extent, matters of defence were not necessarily a priority of the new Australian legislature at the time, and there was also a considerable diversity in opinion regarding the composition and size of the new national army and role it would play at home and indeed within the wider Imperial defence system. Nevertheless, the official transfer of forces from the states to the Commonwealth occurred on 1 March 1901, and this date is today celebrated as the birthday of the modern Australian Army. At the outset, the bulk of the Commonwealth military force was to be made up of part-time volunteers. This was arguably due to two factors. Firstly, there was a widespread desire amongst Australian policymakers to keep defence expenditure low, while secondly there was a widespread mistrust or suspicion surrounding the idea of a large standing army.

After the initial transfer of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments took time to develop. Indeed, it was not until 1 March 1904 that the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot; which did not provide for the establishment of a regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.

The lack of importance placed on military matters in Australian political circles continued for some time, and the size of the Australian military in this time continued to fall, in part due to the emphasis placed upon mounted units in the new command structure. However, following a number of strategic and political &quot;scares&quot;, defence matters slowly began to take on more primacy in the Australian psyche before a review of defence needs was made in 1909 by Field Marshal Lord Kitchener. The result of this review was the realisation of the need to build a credible defence force that could not only defend the nation, but also possibly contribute to the Imperial defence system (although this later realisation remained little more than a consideration on paper only). The review also validated the compulsory military training scheme that was to be introduced in 1910, which was directly responsible for expanding the Citizen Forces by up to 50 percent in the three years prior to the outbreak of World War I. Separately then-Brigadier Kenneth Mackay CB VD was appointed to draw up plans for the Australian Army Reserve in 1915, and became its first director-general in 1916.

Undoubtedly, the scheme proved to have numerous benefits, as many of these youths went on to serve in the First AIF during World War I and the expanded organisation allowed citizen forces officers more experience in commanding formed bodies of men. However, it was the main factor contributing to the decision to recruit the AIF on the basis of voluntary enlistment. Because the army in 1914 was largely made up of young men aged between 19 and 21 who had been enlisted under this scheme, and due to the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot; that precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of the war it was necessary for the Australian government to raise a separate force, outside the Citizen Forces organisation for service overseas. Regardless, it has been estimated that up to 50,000 militiamen subsequently enlisted in the First AIF during the war.

During the precautionary stage on 2 August 1914, Citizen Forces units were called up to guard essential points and man coastal forts and harbour defences. The first Australian shots (many sources report the first Allied shots) of both World War I and World War II were fired by the garrison at Fort Nepean. By June 1918, 9,215 home service troops were on active duty in Australia, alongside 2,476 regular soldiers. From 1915, only skeleton garrisons were maintained at coastal forts, but the personnel manning them were forbidden to enlist in the AIF. This ban was lifted in April 1915 but the presence of a German commerce raider in Australian waters caused a mobilisation from February to April 1916, while another mobilisation occurred in April 1918 for the same reason. Just before the end of World War I, Australia&#x27;s home forces were reorganised to perpetuate the numerical identities of the AIF units. This was done renumbering the infantry regiments that had been formed in 1912, and giving them the numbers of the AIF units that had been formed in their regimental areas. A total of 60 AIF infantry battalions had seen active service during the war, but there were more than 60 infantry regiments; as a result, a number of the Citizen Forces regiments were reorganised with multiple battalions, while other units were converted to pioneer regiments.

===Post World War I===
Following the end of World War I, the units that had been raised as part of the AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence planning returned once more to the maintenance of the Citizen Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men in the event of a war, of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment, i.e. in essence a form of national service. It was also decided that the CMF would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizen Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.

There was little support for compulsory military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt at that time to reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizen Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it was little more than a skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.
In 1929, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the CMF would be maintained on a part-time, voluntary basis only. At this time it was also decided to change the name of the force to the Militia, as it was felt that the latter name implied voluntary service (rather than compulsory national service). The force would be based upon the five divisions of the old AIF, although it was decided to limit the overall number of units. This force would also be armed with modern weapons and equipment. That, at least, was the promise, however, in reality this never came to fruition and to a large extent they continued to be trained and equipped with 1914â18 equipment right up to and during World War II. The result of this change in recruitment policy was a huge drop in the size of the Army, as numbers fell by almost 20,000 in one year as there was little prospect for training and as the financial difficulties of the Great Depression began to be felt. As a result, in 1930 the decision was made to disband or amalgamate a number of units and five infantry battalions and two light horse regiments were removed from the order of battle. The following year, nine more infantry battalions were disbanded.

Between 1929 and 1937, the number of soldiers within the Militia who could provide effective service was well below the force&#x27;s actual on paper strength as many soldiers were unable to attend even a six-day annual camp out of fear of losing their civilian employment. Also, it has been estimated that up to 50 per cent of the Militia&#x27;s other ranks were medically unfit. The numbers situation had become so tenuous that it was rare for a battalion to be able to field even 100 men during an exercise, so units accepted men that would not normally meet the medical requirements, indeed it has been stated that men who were &quot;lame and practically blind&quot; were allowed to join in an effort to improve numbers. To illustrate this, in 1936, the largest battalionâthe 30th/51st Battalionâhad just 412 personnel of all ranks, while the 11th/16th Battalion, which was the smallest, had only 156 men.

Financially the Militia was neglected also. Despite the upturn in the economic situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double the strength of the Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and the nation as a whole was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.

===World War II===
Following the outbreak of the war in Europe, the government&#x27;s immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10,000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month&#x27;s continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot; still precluded conscripts from serving outside Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only and would not be raised directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia&#x27;s ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.

As was the case during World War I, many members of the Militia would go on to serve in the Second AIF. Nevertheless, for a period of time the government attempted to limit the number of militiamen transferring across to the AIF to build defences at home against concerns that Britain might not be able to fulfil its pledge to defend Singapore in the event of an attack there by the Japanese. As such, once again Australia maintained a policy of two armies. For the first two years Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war was focused in overseas theatres in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and during this time it was the AIF that was involved in the fighting overseas, while units of the Militia were used in garrison duties in Australia and New Guinea, then occupied by Australia. During this time, the Militia units came to be derided by the men of the AIF units, with militiamen sometimes being labelled as &quot;chocolate soldiers&quot; or &quot;koalas&quot;.
This changed dramatically, however, following the entry of Japan into the war on 8 December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor and on the British forces in Malaya. Suddenly the war was brought much closer to Australia&#x27;s borders, and there was a perception that Japan might attempt to invade the Australian mainland. In April 1942, following the loss of Malaya and Singapore and the subsequent Japanese landings in New Guinea, the possibility of invasion appeared much more real. Seeing the threat that the Japanese posed to British and Australian interests in the region, the government had begun to bring AIF units back from the Middle East. Nonetheless, the bulk of the forces immediately available for the defence of Australia came from the militia, which was at that stage an organisation of some 265,000 men organised into five infantry and two cavalry divisions.

Despite earlier derision, a number of Militia units went on to perform with distinction during the Pacific War, especially in 1942, when they fought Japanese forces in New Guinea. As the situation in the Pacific worsened in July 1942 and the Japanese drove towards Port Moresby, members of the Militia found themselves on the front lines. As reinforcements were brought up from Australia, the Militia units that had been sent to New Guinea as garrison troops earlier in the war were called upon to fight a stubborn rearguard action on the Kokoda Track to delay the Japanese advance long enough for these reinforcements to arrive. At the same time, the Militia battalions of the 7th Brigade played a key role in the Battle of Milne Bay, when Australian and United States forces defeated the Japanese in a large-scale battle for the first time during the war.

After 1940, use of the term &quot;Militia&quot; to describe the part-time military forces waned and by 1942 the term &quot;Citizen Military Forces&quot; (CMF) had become more common. Later in the war, the &quot;Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943&quot;, officially referring to the organisation as the CMF, was passed to change the law to allow the transfer of Militia or CMF units to the AIF, if 65 percent or more of their personnel had volunteered for overseas service. Additionally, changes to the Act meant that Militia units were able to serve anywhere south of the Equator in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), excluding western Java and northern Borneo, and as a result of this, Militia units saw action against Japanese forces in the Dutch East Indies, at Merauke, later in the war. Despite these changes, the AIF remained the Australian Army&#x27;s main combat force during the war and indeed more than 200,000 members of the Militia transferred to the AIF throughout the course of the conflict. Nevertheless, 32 Militia infantry battalions, later organised into three Militia divisions (3rd, 5th and 11th), saw service over much of the South West Pacific and participated in the following campaigns: Salamaua-Lae, Huon Peninsula, Finisterre Range, New Britain and Bougainville.

===Post World War II to the Vietnam War===

Due to an overcommitment of resources early in the war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was over and, when it had finally come to an end, the government was very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives after the war and as such it was not until 1948 that the CMF was reformed.

Subsequent reviews of defence policy and the strategic situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted in the formation of the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners&#x27; reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve this through voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.

The reintroduction of this conscription scheme saw the numbers of the CMF rise substantially but its management and administration required the allocation of a large number of resources and personnel from the Regular Army at a time when the army Regular Army already heavily committed in Korea and Malaya and so the scheme was suspended in 1959. This was a significant blow to the CMF and its strength fell by more than half in that year to 20,000 men. Further changes came with the introduction of the pentropic (five battle group) division into the Australian Army in 1960. This proved a disaster for the CMF, as wholesale changes were made and units removed from the order of battle. Seven artillery regiments were disbanded from an original total of 17, while 31 infantry battalions were reduced to 17. This excluded the University Regiments and the Papua New Guinea Volunteer Rifles which remained unchanged. The remaining battalions were later merged into just nine battalions. Meanwhile, the CMF armoured units had already been rationalised in 1957 and as a result the change to the pentropic structure mostly resulted in a change in role only, such as the 4th/19th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Light Horse, which changed from an armoured unit to a reconnaissance regiment. The two CMF armoured brigade headquarters were also disbanded.

At the same time, it was decided to amalgamate old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments. While the pentropic system eventually fell by the wayside, these regiments have endured, maintaining the battle honours of the previously existing Militia units that had perpetuated the units of the AIF and serving as a valuable link to the traditions and service of earlier units. Nevertheless, many CMF soldiers felt that the introduction of these regiments reduced the Army&#x27;s links to the community due to the move away from the traditional regionally based system and as a result many of these soldiers chose to leave the organisation. In 1965, as the pentropic system was abandoned, a further re-organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas, namely in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations. In 1966, the Army authorised the raising of six remote area battalions, one in each state. These units offered special conditions of service for men who could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. Ultimately though the Tasmanian battalion was never formed.

The subordinate relationship between the CMF and Regular Army was further underlined when the national service scheme was re-introduced in 1965, albeit in the guise of a selective ballot. Whereas previous incarnations of the system had not allowed for national servicemen to be sent overseas (within various definitions of that term), the new scheme was implemented with the express purpose of sending these recruits overseas as Australia&#x27;s commitments in the region required a large-scale increase in the Army. Additionally, instead of being used to fill the ranks of the CMF, the scheme was essentially used to expand the Regular Army. Due to the terms of service, national servicemen were required to serve two years full-time in Regular Army units, after which they were required to serve a further three years in the CMF. Despite this, however, potential conscripts were given the option to voluntarily enlist in the CMF prior to their date of birth being announced, thus exempting them from being drafted for overseas service. Due to the desire of many to avoid being sent overseas, as a result of this option, it was estimated that by 1968 almost half of the 35,000 men in the CMF had joined to avoid being drafted.

This led to a widespread public perception that the CMF was a refuge for &quot;draft dodgers&quot;, and to the creation of an organisation in which the majority of its members had little or no motivation to fulfil their training obligations. Although this was not a universal experience, overall it affected the morale of the CMF and, coupled with the decision by the government not to activate CMF units for service in Vietnam, this led to a decline in genuine voluntary enlistment. To a large extent also, the government&#x27;s decision to not use the CMF during this time highlighted the organisation&#x27;s increasing structural irrelevance, and questions about the role that the CMF had to play in the defence of Australia would remain until following the end of the Vietnam War. Meanwhile, the last CMF armoured regiment gave up its tanks in 1971.

===Post Vietnam War to the new millennium===
When the Whitlam government came to power in late 1972, the CMF was in a very poor state. The new government moved quickly to end conscription, and this caused the CMF&#x27;s strength to fall by roughly 5,000 to 23,119 by June 1973. In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, the way in which the government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse, ultimately served to at least partially justify some of the cynicism voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.

The committee found that the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still found that there was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation in a time of war would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.

Nevertheless, due to further cuts in defence spending and an eagerness of the government to implement those recommendations that could assist in achieving this goal, units that were unable to meet attendance requirements were disbanded or amalgamated with others, thus further diffusing the community links units had established in their local areas and thus further impacting upon recruitment and retention. Further, the decision was made to abolish the old CMF divisions, as the role of the Army Reserve would no longer be to act as a skeleton force that would be filled out upon mobilisation, but rather a force that could provide individual sub-units of capability should the need arise to augment the Regular Army. Centralisation of training was also a result of the Millar Report; beforehand, recruit training had been an &quot;ad hoc&quot; process managed mainly by the units themselves. Other issues such as pay and conditions of service, protection of civilian employment and recruitment and retention were touched upon but remained largely unaddressed until more recently.
Further reviews came in this time as Defence planners attempted to grapple with the questions regarding strategy following the wars of diplomacy of the previous three decades. The emergence of the Defence of Australia doctrine as the foundation upon which Australian defence policy would be based following Paul Dibb&#x27;s 1986 review of Australia&#x27;s defence capabilities seemed to provide the Reserves with a definite role. Nevertheless, there remained a reluctance to rebuild the Reserves and despite these major reviews, as late as the 1990s the Army still had not managed to develop a well-structured reserve force, as it had continued to grapple with the competing demands of maintaining large-scale general readiness over developing a &#x27;hard core&#x27; of capability within the Reserves that would be able to provide the Army with a nucleus force in times of national emergency.

In 1991, in an attempt to rectify this, the Ready Reserve scheme was established. Under this scheme the 6th Brigade, an existing Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time, was converted to a Ready Reserve formation. The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the newly elected Howard government.

By the time that the opening phases of the East Timor operation began in 1999, the issue regarding the purpose of the Army Reserve still had not been resolved. Instead of being able to provide formed units to augment the Regular Army, the Reserves was reduced to providing individuals for round-out purposes only. As a result, in the initial phase of the operation there were only 100 Reservists available to fill positions in INTERFET, mostly in specialist roles that the Regular Army had trouble providing. As the deployment progressed to a second rotation in April 2000, however, a further 630 Reservists volunteered for full-time service.
The deployment to East Timor highlighted the limits of the Australian Defence Force and the need for an Army Reserve that could effectively provide deployable capabilities and individuals to round-out to the Regular Army in times of heavy operational commitment. As such, in late 2000 the government did what many governments had toyed with since the formation of the citizen force almost a hundred years earlier: enacting legislation that enabled the call-up of Reservists to full-time service in circumstances that fell short of a full scale defence emergency, thereby allowing their deployment overseas, while also protecting their employment and providing remuneration to employers.

The continuing high operational tempo of the Army after East Timor further emphasised the need to develop the capability of the Army Reserve. Since then increasing numbers of Reservists have been deployed overseas in varying capacities as well as undertaking periods of full-time service in Australia to maintain capabilities within Regular units heavily committed to deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In lower intensity areas, such as East Timor and the Solomon Islands, formed units of Reservists raised from personnel drawn from many units, have been deployed on peacekeeping duties to relieve the pressure being placed upon the Regular Army and allowing them to focus on the higher intensity combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to this Australian Army Reserve units have been deployed on border security duties with the Royal Australian Navy as part of Operation Relex, as well as participating regularly in multinational exercises such as Rifle Company Butterworth.

As such, the role of the Army Reserve now encompasses the &#x27;3 Rs&#x27;âthat is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005â06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008â09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.

In late 2008 a company from the 1st Commando Regiment became the first formed Army Reserve unit to see combat since World War II when it was deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Australian Special Operations Task Group. The initial deployment proved problematic however, with a subsequent inquiry finding that the company had received less support for its pre-deployment preparations than was typical for regular units and that its training was inadequate. The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.

Between 2004 and 2017 a total of approximately 2,400 Army Reserve personnel have deployed on operations.

===Plan Beersheba reforms===
In 2011, the Army Reserve&#x27;s role and structure began being reformed under the Plan Beersheba reorganisation of the Army. The Army has stated that the reserves&#x27; role will become &quot;to deliver specified capability and support and sustain Australian Defence Force (ADF) preparedness and operations&quot;.

As part of this reform, the six Army Reserve brigades are being paired with the regular brigades. The 4th and 9th Brigades will partner with the 1st Brigade, the 5th and 8th Brigades with the 7th Brigade, and the 11th and 13th Brigades with the 3rd Brigade. The pairs of Army Reserve brigades will be expected to be able to provide a battalion-sized force upon mobilisation during the regular brigade&#x27;s 12 month &#x27;ready&#x27; phase.

The structure of the reserve brigades is also being altered. The reserve artillery regiments will be re-equipped with mortars; the reserve Royal Australian Armoured Corps units will convert from light cavalry to producing crews for Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, and a brigade operational supply company will be established within each of the combat services support battalions.

==Current structure==
===Components===
The Australian Army Reserve currently consists of the following components:
* Standby Reserve
* Active Reserve

These components are basically categories of service, which are determined by the level of training obligation and commitment that a member is required to meet.

=== 2nd Division ===

The majority of Australian Army Reserve units are under the command of the 2nd Division in six state-based brigades.

<doc id="703352" wikidata="Q5250800" url="?curid=703352" title="Deer Park, Toronto">
<text>Deer Park is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is centered on the intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue and its boundaries are the Vale of Avoca section of Rosedale ravine in the east, Farnham Avenue and Jackes Avenue in the south, Avenue Road and Oriole Parkway in the west, the Beltline Trail in the north on the west side of Yonge Street, and Glen Elm Avenue in the north on the east side of Yonge Street. For the purposes of social policy analysis and research, the Toronto governmentâs Social Development &amp; Administration division includes Deer Park within the City of Toronto&#x27;s official &quot;Rosedale-Moore Park&quot; and &quot;Yonge-St.Clair&quot; neighbourhood profiles. The neighbourhood is in Ward 22, represented by Councillor Josh Matlow at Toronto City Council.

The commercial area along the main streets is known simply as Yonge and St. Clair. Marked by a cluster of office buildings, the area also includes a number of restaurants, shops, and services, as well as the St. Clair subway station, the terminus for the 512 St. Clair streetcar.

==History==
The name dates from 1837, when the Heath family purchased of land on the northwest corner of Yonge and St. Clair (then the Third Concession Road) and named it Deer Park. By the 1850s, the neighbourhood included a racetrack, a school, and a hotel at which patrons could feed deer that roamed the Heath family&#x27;s land. The Heath property was subdivided in 1846 and was entirely sold off by 1874.
In 1891, Upper Canada College moved from its urban location to the then still rural Deer Park area, establishing a large campus that remains in the same location today, interrupting Avenue Road north of St. Clair Avenue.

In 1931, De La Salle College (Toronto) moved from its downtown location to an estate named &#x27;Oaklands&#x27; that was originally purchased and built upon by Senator John Macdonald in 1858. Oaklands forms part of the southern boundary of Deer Park, running eastward along the escarpment from Avenue Road.
Deer Park was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1908, and by the 1930s, it had become an upper-middle class residential district, which it remains today. The intersection of Yonge and St. Clair is also the site of extensive nodal commercial development.

In 1999, Robert Fulford described the current character of the neighbourhood: &quot;sandwiched between Forest Hill on its western flank and Moore Park to the east, Deer Park is utterly unlike either of themâit&#x27;s more commercial, a fast-changing community dominated by apartment dwellers.&quot;

On February 14, 2017, a large fire broke out at a local sports club, the Badminton and Racquet Club of Toronto, evacuating nearby residents, closing streets, and diverting TTC routes. The historic section was originally a streetcar barn dating back to the 1880s (as a horsecar barn for the then Metropolitan Street Railway) that was converted to badminton courts in 1924 when it was sold by the Toronto Transportation Commission.

==Education==

In Deer Park, secular English-oriented public schools are operated by the Toronto District School Board. In the City of Toronto, secular French-oriented public schools are provided by &quot;Conseil scolaire Viamonde&quot;, while publicly funded English and French Catholic schools are operated by the Toronto Catholic District School Board and the &quot;Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir&quot; respectively. However, none of the latter three school boards operate a school in Deer Park, although one was previously operated as a secondary school.

The following schools are located in the Deer Park area:
* Deer Park Public School is a public school located at 23 Ferndale Avenue. It has been serving the community for about 125 years. Deer Park has many challenging academic, sport and art programs. They include basketball, football, ultimate frisbee, Me To We club, swim team and the theatre production. Deer Park serves students from kindergarten to grade 8.
* De La Salle College is a Roman Catholic co-educational private school that was established in 1851 as a boys school. Beginning in the late 1960s until June 1994, this school was operated as a public separate secondary school from 1987, which was a sister school to St. Joseph&#x27;s College School on Wellesley Street. The school was re-privatized in 1994, and Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School replaced De La Salle in 1998.
* The Linden School is a private school for girls.
* The York School is a co-educational private school.
* Upper Canada College is a private school for boys that was established in 1829.

==Landmarks==
* Avoca Ravine
* David A. Balfour Park
* Vale of Avoca (bridge)

===Churches===
* Calvin Presbyterian Church
* Christ Church Deer Park
* Deer Park United Church (the congregation now worships at 26 Delisle Avenue)
* Yorkminster Park Baptist Church

===High-rise buildings===
* Imperial Oil Building (now known as Imperial Plaza)
* Wittington Tower

===Historic houses===
* 555 Avenue Road â built in 1930 for Howard Ferguson (Premier of Ontario from 1923 to 1930), it now serves as the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea.
* 50 Farnham Avenue â Farnham Lodge was built in 1844 as a home for Edward Hooper, then altered around 1910. It is the oldest surviving house in Deer Park and one of the oldest buildings in Toronto.
* 131 Farnham Avenue â currently the location of De La Salle College, an estate named &quot;Oaklands&quot; was once part of the Crown land that was deeded in 1798 to the Honourable John Elmsley. In 1858, John Macdonald â a successful dry goods merchant who would become the only Liberal appointee to the Senate by Canada&#x27;s founding prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald â acquired of the land from the Anglican Church. The Oaklands mansion has been designated as a historical building by the City of Toronto government, as an example of local Gothic Revival architecture.
* 32 Heath Street West â John Palmer, the last owner of Lawton Park, built this house for his daughter, Mrs. Henry Baird, and it is used today by the Canadian Mothercraft Society as a daycare centre and school.
* 40 Heath Street West â at one time owned by the Anglican Church of Canada, Archbishop Desmond Tutu stayed in the house, which was used for visiting clerical dignitaries. The police occupied the house while staking out the Boyd Gang, which resulted in their arrest as noted below. The house was demolished after 2010 and replaced by a new home.
* 42 Heath Street West â after a stakeout, Canada&#x27;s most notorious bank robber of the day, Edwin Boyd, leader of the Boyd Gang, was captured in this house at 6:00 am on March 15, 1952. Even Toronto&#x27;s mayor of the day, Allan Lamport, got into the act, escorting Boyd out of the house accompanied by Sergeant Adolphus (Dolph) Payne of the Toronto police force.
* 50 Heath Street West â constructed in 1923, the McNamara House is a rare example of the Prairie School of architecture in Toronto.
* 35 Jackes Avenue â completed in 1914 as the home of businessman Robert Laidlaw, it currently serves as the headquarters of Frontier College and is now called Gzowski House.
* 76 Lonsdale Road â John Ford House was built in 1875 for Captain John Ford Jr. It has a mansard roof, which is typical of Second Empire architecture.
* 73 Lonsdale Road â a cottage in the Second Empire style that was built around 1878 by Captain John Ford Jr. as a home for his parents.

===St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery===
Deer Park is also home to one of Toronto&#x27;s oldest cemeteries. St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery (Toronto) was opened by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto on September 28, 1855. There are some 29,000 graves in the cemetery.

Ten acres in size, St. Michael&#x27;s has the unusual characteristic of being surrounded on all sides by the backs of buildings, thus making it nearly invisible from the street. It is bound on the north by stores, apartments and office buildings along St. Clair Avenue West, on the west by houses along Foxbar Road, on the south by houses and Toronto Fire Services Station 311 along Balmoral Avenue, and on the east by stores and office buildings along Yonge Street. Entrance to the cemetery is gained through an alley off Yonge Street.

The cemetery&#x27;s octagonal mortuary vault was used to store bodies in the winter until the ground thawed. Designed by architect Joseph Sheard, who was also mayor of Toronto in 1871-72, the vault was designated a historic property under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in December 1975.

===1331 Yonge Street===

A studio complex was located on 1331 Yonge Street, three blocks south of St. Clair Avenue, the building previously constructed as a book bindery and showroom. In 1959, the building was renovated as the headquarters of CHUM Radio, a division of CTVglobemedia (now known as Bell Media), and to the studios of the company&#x27;s Toronto radio stations, CHUM and CHUM-FM as well as CHUM Radio&#x27;s national operations. The most prominent feature of the building&#x27;s exterior was the famous &quot;CHUM Dial 1050&quot; neon sign over the front entrance.

In July 2008, CTVgm announced that it would sell the building to developer Aspen Ridge Homes for $21.5 million. The stations were expected to move to 250 Richmond Street West, a downtown location at Richmond Street and Simcoe near 299 Queen Street West, in 2009. The neon sign was moved to the new location.

In preparation for the move, the stations held an open house on November 15, 2008, inviting listeners to visit for a tour of the historic building and an exhibit of CHUM&#x27;s radio memorabilia.

The company&#x27;s radio stations were officially relocated to 250 Richmond Street West on August 19, 2009, which is now Bell Media Radio. After the stations moved out, 1331 Yonge Street came under the ownership of Aspen Ridge Homes and was home to their offices, as well as the offices for the advertising agency, &quot;The Brand Factory.&quot; In September 2016, the building was officially demolished, in order for a condominium complex to be built on the site.

<text>A cervelliere (cerveliÃ¨re, cervelliera; , , &quot;, &quot;) is a hemispherical, close-fitting skull cap of steel or iron. It was worn as a helmet during the medieval period and a version known as a &quot;secret&quot; was worn under felt hats during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the early modern period.

== History ==
The cervelliere was first introduced during the late 12th century. It was worn either alone or more often over or under a mail coif. Additionally, a great helm could be worn over a cervelliere, and by the late 13th century this was the usual practice.

Over time, the cervelliere experienced several evolutions. Many helmets became increasingly pointed and the back of the skull cap elongated to cover the neck, thus developing into the bascinet. Cerveillieres were worn throughout the medieval period and even during the Renaissance. They were cheap and easy to produce and thus much used by commoners and non-professional soldiers who could not afford more advanced protection.

Anecdotally, medieval literature credits the invention of the cervelliÃ¨re to astrologer Michael Scot , though this is not seriously entertained by most historians. The &quot;Chronicon Nonantulanum&quot; records that the astrologer devised the iron-plate cap shortly before his own predicted death, which he still inevitably met when a stone weighing two ounces fell on his protected head.

<text>Cheltenham is a suburb in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Cheltenham is 18Â kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire.

Cheltenham is a small residential affluent suburb with a distinctive English atmosphere, characterised by a number of 19th century mansions on tree-lined streets. Cheltenham shares its postcode of 2119 with Beecroft and has sometimes been viewed as part of the suburb. Most residents of Cheltenham see themselves as distinct from Beecroft, although local issues are addressed together in the Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust.
==History==
Cheltenham takes its name from a house built by William Chorley, a Sydney tailor and men&#x27;s outfitter, who acquired the land when it was released from the Field of Mars Reserve. He named the house after his birthplace of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. Chorley asked the government to build a station here and to name it after his property when it opened in 1898. Sutherland Road was named for John Sutherland, Minister for Public Works from 1887 to 1889.

Cheltenham transformed during the 20th century, following the general pattern of suburban development in Sydney. From a semi-rural area, it grew into a quiet, leafy suburb that became increasingly urbanised as the century progressed. By the end of the century, Cheltenham became a well-established part of Sydney&#x27;s North Shore, known for its family-friendly atmosphere, proximity to amenities, and accessibility to the city.

Cheltenham Girls High School opened in 1957 as a compressive high school for girls.

==Beecroft Cheltenham History Group==

The Beecroft Cheltenham History Group was founded in 1987 by local history enthusiasts to record the history of Beecroft and Cheltenham and to collect and preserve photos and other historical information relative to the area. Since 2005 it has been part of the Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust. In 1995 a book covering the history of Beecroft and Cheltenham up to 1914 was published. In 2004 a book on walks around the district was published. In 2005 a book about the Beecroft Children&#x27;s Library was published.

==Heritage listings==
Cheltenham has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 67 Cobran Road: &quot;Ahimsa&quot;

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, there were 2,166 residents in Cheltenham. These are sub-divided as follows:
; Ethnic diversity : 64.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was China at 9.5% followed by Hong Kong with 3.6%, England with 3.0%, India with 2.3%, and Sri Lanka with 1.7%. The most common ancestries in Cheltenham were English 27.2%, Australian 25.5%, Chinese 24.4%, Scottish 12.3% and Irish with 10.3%. 66.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 11.4%, Cantonese 7.2%, Tamil 1.4%, Korean 1.4%, Hindi 1.0%. 
; Age distribution : The median age of people in Cheltenham was 46, compared to the national median of 38. Children aged under 15 made up 16.6% of the population, and people aged 65 and over made up 19.3% of the population.
; Income : Cheltenham is a wealthy suburb, with the median weekly household income being $3,573, more than double the national median weekly income of $1,746.
; Housing : 95.7% of the dwellings in Cheltenham are made up of separate houses.
; Religion : The most common responses for religion were No Religion 39.2%, Anglican 15.2%, Catholic 14.1%, Hinduism 4.1% and Buddhism 3.5%.

==Transport==
Cheltenham railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. It is one of the few stations with no surrounding business district, due to William Chorley placing covenants on the surrounding land.

The M2 Hills Motorway runs along the southern border of the suburb. For many years, Sutherland Road ran through both Beecroft and Cheltenham, and acted as a shortcut between Beecroft Road and Epping Road. This road ran to the east of the Railway line and, during peak hour, was quite busy. With the opening of the M2 Hills Motorway in 1997, Sutherland Road was closed at the Devlins Creek bridge - where the M2 enters a tunnel under North Epping. The result of this closure is that the areas east of the railway line are now very quiet, and the house values have benefitted.

==Schools==
Cheltenham Girls&#x27; High School, a government school, is located along Beecroft Road and The Promenade. Beecroft Public School and Arden Anglican School are primary schools in nearby Beecroft.

==Commercial area==
From its early days, Cheltenham was almost exclusively a residential suburb with no shopping area developed at all in its planning. Residents of Cheltenham often shop in Beecroft, Pennant Hills or Epping. The nearest shopping mall is in Carlingford.

==Ahimsa==

Ahimsa (an Indian word meaning non-violence) is the name of a bush retreat located in Cobran Road. It was originally the home of the environmentalist Marie Byles, who died in the house in 1979. It can be accessed at the rear of Day Road and Cobran Road (both roads are cul-de-sacs). The site is administered by the National Trust of Australia. The house is leased privately but the bush area is open to the public within certain restrictions.

<text>Lonsdale was a marque of car sold in the United Kingdom by the Colt Car Company between 1982 and 1983. It took its name from the industrial suburb of Lonsdale in Adelaide, South Australia, where Mitsubishi Australia had an engine production facility. The only car sold under this brand was the Lonsdale, a badge engineered Mitsubishi Sigma (GJ). It was sold as the Lonsdale YD41 and the Lonsdale YD45. 700 were produced.

The car was powered by one of three four cylinder engines of 1.6, 2.0 and 2.6 litres, producing respectively 81, 95 and 103 bhp.

The largest of these power units produced a maximum torque of 192 Nm., and was one of the largest post-war four cylinder engines produced.

Although the Sigma was merely an Australian version of Mitsubishi Motors&#x27; Colt Galant which was already available in the UK, the company&#x27;s plan was to circumvent the &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot;, a voluntary import quota which limited Japanese-manufactured imports to 11 per cent of the market (which typically amounted to fewer than 200,000 cars per year). However, the idea proved unsuccessful and most of the cars imported by Lonsdale remained unsold by the time the company ceased trading. The Colt Car Company continued to sell the vehicle in the UK for 1984, although rebranded as the Mitsubishi Galant.

<doc id="703364" wikidata="Q2571494" url="?curid=703364" title="Carlos CÃ©sar">
<text>Carlos Manuel Martins do Vale CÃ©sar,  (born 30 October 1956) is a Portuguese politician and former President of the Regional Government of the Portuguese autonomous region of the Azores. He currently serves as member of the Assembly of the Republic, member of the Council of State and President of the Socialist Party.

==Early life==
He was born at Ponta Delgada into a family with republican and democratic traditions and a history of participatory activism. His grand-uncle Manuel Augusto CÃ©sar was a social activist during the Portuguese First Republic, who edited the newspapers &quot;O ProletÃ¡rio&quot;, the weekly &quot;FederaÃ§Ã£o OperÃ¡ria&quot;, the &quot;Protesto&quot; (the publication of the Centro Socialista Antero de Quental) and &quot;Protesto do Povo&quot; (another socialist publication).

==Career==
His civic knowledge, following the Carnation Revolution, was profoundly shaped by his brother HorÃ¡cio do Vale CÃ©sar (also a journalist), and many of the socialist figures of the period, including Jaime Gama, MÃ¡rio Mesquita and Medeiros Ferreira (all students of the school Liceu Nacional Antero de Quental).

He began public life in the opposition to the Estado Novo, in the last years of the regime, becoming a member of the Cooperativa Cultural &quot;Sextante&quot;, which was extinct by the National Assembly, in December 1972. In 1973, at 17 years of age, he became a member of the ComissÃ£o Dinamizadora da ComissÃ£o DemocrÃ¡tica Eleitoral, in Ponta Delgada. On April 26, 1974 he founded the &quot;AssociaÃ§Ã£o de Estudantes do Liceu Antero de Quental&quot; (&quot;Antero Quental Students&#x27; Association&quot;) and, a month later, the &quot;Juventude Socialista&quot; (&quot;Socialist Youth&quot;) of the Azores. He was a member of the first Secretariat elected to the Socialist Party (PS) in Ponta Delgada, and was part of the delegation from the Azores in the First National Congress of the PS, participating in the party youth-wing, the &quot;Juventude Socialista&quot; (JS).

In 1975, he entered the Faculty of Law at the University of Lisbon, although he did not complete his licenciatura. During his period of studies, he also became involved in the &quot;DirecÃ§Ã£o da AssociaÃ§Ã£o AcadÃ©mica da Faculdade de Direito&quot; (&quot;Directorate of the Law Faculty&#x27;s Academic Association&quot;). While in Lisbon he worked as administrative coordinator in a local cooperative responsible for documentation and culture. During this time he continued as the national leader of the JS (to this day he retains a national honorary status in the organization). He was an adjunct to the Secretary of State for Public Administration during the II Constitutional Government.

His political career did not slow down, when he returned to the Azores: in January 1981 he entered the Azorean Legislative Assembly at the age of 26. Shortly after, he became involved in the &quot;DirecÃ§Ã£o do Grupo Parlamentar&quot; (&quot;Directorate of the Parliamentary Group&quot;) of the PS, as well as various parliamentary commissions, as well as presiding over the commission on Economic Affairs. Between 1983 and 1985, he was elected as Regional Legislative Assembly&#x27;s Vice-President, and took on the Presidency of PS Azores. He returned to national politics between 1987 and 1989, as a representative in the Assembly of the Republic, in the AntÃ³nio Guterres government. Once again returning to the Azores, he became a member of the Municipal Assembly of Ponta Delgada, as well as the President of the Civil Parish of FajÃ£ de Baixo. On 30 October 1994 (his 38th birthday) he was made the Presidente of the PS Azores, with 92% of the votes.

===Presidency of the Azores===
In 1996, he won the elections for the Regional Legislative Assembly of the Azores, by a narrow margin, winning 46% of the votes cast. The PS, under his leadership, would contest the regional legislative elections in 2000, 2004 and 2008.

Although these victories brought cohesion and stability, they also brought stresses associated with internal change. Under Cesar the Political statute of the Azores was changed to limit the number of successive mandate&#x27;s occupied by the president, resulting in his announcement (in 2008) not to run as his party&#x27;s candidate for the 2012 elections. This was a bit of a controversy, as it was unclear at the time that Carlos CÃ©sar would break his own promise not run again. Vasco Cordeiro was eventually chosen as his party&#x27;s successor, inline with the politics established in CÃ©sar&#x27;s leadership. The two other candidates for the position, JosÃ© Contente and SÃ©rgio Ãvila, were possible successors, but easily abandoned by the PS: Contente was a recognized apparatchik of the party and about the same age as CÃ©sar, while Ãvila was point-man in the Vice-Presidency (responsible for regional finances) and a Terceirense, which hurt his chances of succeeding on the vote-rich island of SÃ£o Miguel, where the PSD leader and mayor of Ponta Delgada (Berta Cabral) could easily obtain an advantage.

===Post-Azores===
Carlos CÃ©sar has been elected member of the Assembly of the Republic in the 2015 election, therefore returning to the Parliament where he has been between 1987 and 1991.

He is one of the five personalities elected by the Assembly of the Republic to the Council of State on 18 December 2015, and he took office on 12 January 2016.

==Honours==
* Grand-Cross of the Order of Christ, Portugal (February 19, 2013)

==Personal life==
CÃ©sar is married to LuÃ­sa Maria Assis Vital Gomes do Vale CÃ©sar. Their son is the politician Francisco CÃ©sar.

<text>The Verona Arena (, ) is a Roman amphitheatre in Piazza Bra in Verona, Italy, built in 30 AD. It is still in use and serves as a venue for large-scale opera performances. 

It is one of the best preserved ancient structures of its kind. In ancient times, the arena&#x27;s capacity was nearly 30,000 people. The stage for concerts and opera performances decreases the available capacity to a maximum of 22,000.

==Amphitheatre==

The building itself was built in AD 30 on a site which was then beyond the city walls. The &quot;ludi&quot; (shows and games) staged there were so famous that spectators came from many other places, often far away, to witness them. The amphitheatre could host more than 30,000 spectators in ancient times.
The round facade of the building was originally composed of white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, but after a major earthquake in 1117, which almost completely destroyed the structure&#x27;s outer ring, except for the so-called &quot;ala&quot; (wing), the stone was quarried for re-use in other buildings. Nevertheless, it impressed medieval visitors to the city, one of whom considered it to have been a labyrinth, without ingress or egress. Ciriaco d&#x27;Ancona was filled with admiration for the way it had been built and Giovanni Antonio Panteo&#x27;s civic panegyric &quot;De laudibus veronae&quot;, 1483, remarked that it struck the viewer as a construction that was more than human.

==Opera venue==
The first interventions to recover the arena&#x27;s function as an opera venue began during the Renaissance. Some operatic performances were later mounted in the building during the 1850s, owing to its outstanding acoustics.

In 1913, operatic performances in the arena commenced in earnest due to the zeal and initiative of the Italian opera tenor Giovanni Zenatello and the impresario Ottone Rovato. The first 20th-century operatic production at the arena, a staging of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, took place on 10 August of that year, to mark the birth of Verdi 100 years before in 1813. The composers Puccini and Mascagni were in attendance. Since then, summer seasons of opera have been mounted continually at the arena, except in 1915â18 and 1940â45, when Europe was convulsed in war.

In modern times, at least four productions (sometimes up to six) are mounted each year between June and August. During the winter months, the local opera and ballet companies perform at the Teatro Filarmonico.

Modern-day travellers are advised that admission tickets to sit on the arena&#x27;s stone steps are much cheaper to buy than tickets giving access to the padded chairs available on lower levels. Candles are distributed to the audience and lit after sunset around the arena.

Every year over 500,000 people see productions of the popular operas in this arena. Once capable of housing 20,000 patrons per performance (now limited to 15,000 because of safety reasons), the arena has featured many of world&#x27;s most notable opera singers. In the post-World War II era, they have included Giuseppe Di Stefano, Maria Callas, Tito Gobbi and Renata Tebaldi among other names. A number of conductors have appeared there, too. The official arena shop has historical recordings made by some of them available for sale.

The opera productions in the Verona Arena had not used any microphones or loudspeakers until a sound reinforcement system was installed in 2011.

==Arena di Verona Festival==
Arena di Verona Festival is a summer festival of opera, inaugurated in 1913 with Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, to celebrate the centenary of the artist&#x27;s birth.

==Other uses==

In recent times, the arena has also hosted several concerts of international rock and pop bands, among which Zucchero Fornaciari, who holds the record of the highest number of concerts in the location, 38 from 1989 to 2017, and the highest number of concerts during the same tour, 22 of the &quot;Black Cat World Tour&quot;, Roger Waters, Bruce Springsteen, Elisa, Eros Ramazzotti, Laura Pausini, Pink Floyd, Alicia Keys, One Direction, Simple Minds (whose concert film &quot;Verona&quot; was filmed at the venue during their &quot;Street Fighting Years&quot; Tour on 15 September 1989) Duran Duran, Deep Purple, The Who, Dire Straits, Scatman John, Mike Oldfield, Rod Stewart, Michael Flatley, Yanni, Sting, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, BjÃ¶rk, Eiffel 65, Muse, Leonard Cohen, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Jamiroquai, Whitney Houston, Mumford &amp; Sons, Kiss, Spandau Ballet, 5 Seconds Of Summer, MÃ¥neskin, 2Cellos, and Evanescence.

In 2020, following the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest, the Arena played host to Diodato, who had won the Sanremo Music Festival, for a special performance of his song &#x27;Fai rumore&#x27; in the empty arena. Italy had been one of the favourites to win and the performance became one of the highlights of &#x27;&#x27;.

In 1981, 1984, 2010, 2019, and 2022, the arena hosted the podium and presentation of the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

From 25 September 2021 to 4 October 2023, the venue hosted &quot;Arena Suzuki&quot;, an Italian television program of a variety of musical genres, broadcast in prime time on Rai 1, and presented by Amadeus.

The first game of 2023 CEV European Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championships took place in the Arena. Home team and defending European champs Italy faced Romania in the first game of Pool B.

The closing ceremonies of the MilanâCortina d&#x27;Ampezzo 2026 Winter Olympics, and the opening ceremonies of the 2026 Winter Paralympics, are scheduled to be hosted by the arena.

<doc id="703371" wikidata="Q449536" url="?curid=703371" title="Elaine de Kooning">
<text>Elaine Marie Catherine de Kooning ( , ; ; March 12, 1918 â February 1, 1989) was an Abstract Expressionist and Figurative Expressionist painter in the post-World War II era. She wrote extensively on the art of the period and was an editorial associate for &quot;Art News&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==

Elaine de Kooning was born Elaine Marie Catherine Fried in 1918 in Flatbush, New York. Later in life she told people she was born in 1920. Her parents were Mary Ellen O&#x27;Brien, an Irish Catholic, and Charles Frank Fried, a Protestant of Jewish descent. Her father Charles was a plant manager for the Bond Bread Company.

Elaine was the eldest of four children; Marjorie (Luyckx), Conrad, and Peter were her siblings. Her mother, despite being recalled as less loving and attentive than some parents by Elaine&#x27;s younger sister, supported her eldest&#x27;s artistic endeavors.

Elaine&#x27;s mother started taking Elaine to museums at the age of five and taught her to draw what she saw. Elaine&#x27;s childhood room was decorated with painting reproductions. Her mother was committed to the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center for a year during Elaine&#x27;s childhood after a neighbor reported her for neglect of her children.

== Studies ==

In grade school, Elaine began drawing and selling portraits of children attending her school. She was interested in and did well at sports as well as art. Elaine studied at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. After graduating from High School, she briefly studied math at Hunter College in New York City, where she befriended a group of abstract and Social Realist painters. In 1937, she attended the Leonardo da Vinci Art School and went on to study at the American Artists School, both in New York City. While attending school, Elaine made money working as an art school model.

==Marriage to Willem de Kooning==

In the fall of 1938 her teacher Robert Jonas introduced her to Willem de Kooning at a Manhattan cafeteria when she was 20 and he 34. Elaine had admired his artwork before meeting him. After meeting, Willem began to instruct her in drawing and painting. They painted in his loft at 143 West 21st Street, and he was known for his harsh criticism of her work, &quot;sternly requiring that she draw and redraw a figure or still life and insisting on fine, accurate, clear linear definition supported by precisely modulated shading.&quot; He even destroyed many of her drawings, but this &quot;impelled Elaine to strive for both precision and grace in her work&quot;. When they married on December 9, 1943, she moved into his loft and they continued sharing studio spaces.

The couple had what was later called an open marriage; they both were casual about sex and about each other&#x27;s affairs. Elaine had affairs with men who helped further Willem&#x27;s career, such as Harold Rosenberg, a renowned art critic; Thomas B. Hess, a writer about art and managing editor for ARTnews; and Charles Egan, owner of the Charles Egan Gallery. Willem had a daughter, Lisa de Kooning, in 1956, as a result of his affair with Joan Ward.

Elaine and Willem both struggled with alcoholism, which eventually led to their separation in 1957. While separated, Elaine remained in New York, struggling with poverty, and Willem moved to Long Island and dealt with depression. Despite struggling with alcoholism, they both continued painting. Although separated for nearly twenty years, they never divorced, ultimately reuniting in 1976.

==Career==

Elaine de Kooning was an accomplished landscape and portrait artist active in the Abstract Expressionist movement of the mid-twentieth century. She was a member of the Eighth Street Club (the Club) in New York City. The Club functioned as a space to discuss ideas. Among this group of artists were Willem de Kooning, Jimmy Rosati, Giorgio Spaventi, Milton Resnick, Pat Passlof, Earl Kerkam, Ludwig Sander, Angelo Ippolito, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, and Hans Hofmann. A membership position for a woman was rare at that time.

Elaine promoted Willem&#x27;s work throughout their relationship. Along with her own work as a painter, she was committed to gaining recognition for her husband&#x27;s work. Though she was very serious about her own work, she was well-aware that it was often overshadowed by her husband&#x27;s fame. After showing their work in their 1951 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery, &quot;Artists: Man and Wife&quot;, which also included Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, and Jean Arp and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Elaine said, &quot;It seemed like a good idea at the time, but later I came to think that it was a bit of a put-down of the women. There was something about the show that sort of &quot;attached&quot; women-wives- to the &quot;real&quot; artists&quot;&quot;.&quot; Despite this effect on her own career, Elaine continued to promote her husband.

In 1952 she spent the summer at Art dealer Leo Castelli&#x27;s house at The Hamptons with Willem de Kooning.

In April 1954 Elaine presented her first Solo exhibition at the Stable Gallery (she sometimes declared it was in 1952 but the gallery was founded in 1953)

Women were often marginalized in the Abstract Expressionist movement, functioning as objects and accessories to confirm the masculinity of their male counterparts. For that reason, she chose to sign her artworks with her initials rather than her full name, to avoid her paintings&#x27; being labeled as feminine in a traditionally masculine movement, and to not be confused with her husband Willem de Kooning.

Elaine and Willem were also part of the New York School scene, which included Jackson Pollock.

Elaine de Kooning was an important writer and teacher of art. She began working at the magazine &quot;ARTnews&quot; in 1948, and wrote articles about major figures in the art world. She wrote about one hundred articles for &quot;Art News&quot; magazine. Elaine de Kooning was the first American artist in the 1950s to take on the role of artists&#x27; critic. &quot;As an writer, she wrote about culture, art, and new ideas to her generation of artists and readers.&quot; Although Elaine was a successful writer, she considered herself a &quot;painter by nature.&quot; Elaine de kooning&#x27;s art and writing were all devoted to art and humanity.

Over the course of her life, she held teaching posts at many institutions of higher education. In 1957, after Elaine and Willem de Kooning separated, she took on a series of short-term teaching jobs to support herself. She taught at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque; the University of California in Davis; at Carnegie Mellon, at Southampton College on Long Island; at the Cooper Union and Pratt Institute in New York; at Yale; at RISD in Rhode Island; Bard College; the University of Georgia and the New York Studio School in Paris. Between 1976 and 1978, she served as the first Lamar Dodd Visiting Professor of Art at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens. In 1985 she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full academician in 1988.

In 2016 de Kooning was one of twelve female artists featured in the &quot;Women of Abstract Expressionism&quot;&quot;&quot; exhibition organized by the Denver Art Museum. The purpose of this show was to highlight the unique talents and perspectives of female artists who, as was previously noted, were often dismissed or overshadowed by their male counterparts. The show later traveled to the Mint Museum and the Palm Springs Art Museum.

&quot;For Elaine, everything was always new, never resolved, always being unmade and made, as if it had never been made before. She did not accumulate experience and learn what to expect ... Life was a constant surprise.&quot; Being the wife of the famous painter Willem de Kooning, she did not receive real recognition for her own achievement until a few years before she died. Her works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum Of Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.

==Art==
Elaine de Kooning made both abstract and figurative paintings and drawings of still life, cityscapes, and portraits. Her work was influenced by the artists Willem de Kooning and Arshile Gorky, artists who worked abstractly and also in a figurative way. Her earlier work comprised watercolors and still lifes, including fifty watercolor sketches inspired by a statue in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. Later in her career, her work fused abstraction with mythology, primitive imagery, and realism. Her gestural style of portraiture is often noted, although her work was mostly figurative and representational, and rarely purely abstract. She produced a diverse body of work over the course of her lifetime, including sculpture, etchings, and work inspired by cave drawings, all in addition to her many paintings. Her work presents a combination between painting and drawing, surface and contour, stroke and line, color and light, transparency and opacity.

When asked about her style she said, &quot;I&#x27;m more interested in character than style. Character comes out of the work. Style is applied or imposed on the work. Style can be a prison.

=== Early works ===
In the summer of 1948, Elaine and Willem de Kooning spent a summer at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina. Elaine studied under Josef Albers, R. Buckminster Fuller and Merce Cunningham. A regular participant in theatrical performances, Elaine was very involved in the college&#x27;s social life.

=== Portraits ===

A large portion of Elaine de Kooning&#x27;s work was in portraiture. In addition to painting many self-portraits throughout the course of her life, her subjects were often fellow artistsâusually menâincluding poets Frank O&#x27;Hara, John Ashbery, and Allen Ginsberg; writer Donald Barthelme; art critic Harold Rosenberg; Thomas B. Hess, managing editor of Artnews; choreographer Merce Cunningham; legendary art dealer Leo Castelli; innovative jazz musician Ornette Coleman; the famous Brazilian soccer star Pele; and painters Joop Sanders, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and her husband, Willem de Kooning. Although she worked in a gestural Abstract Expressionist mode, she never abandoned working with the figure ensuring the person&#x27;s likeness.

In 1944, Elaine met 22 year-old Dutch artist Joop Sanders at a Virgil Thomson concert. They agreed to pose for each other and that began a years-long collaboration that produced dozens of portraits. Elaine called hers the &quot;Joop Paintings&quot;. After spending a day drawing Sanders, she would work for a week turning the drawings into a painting. In the process, Elaine said she became &quot;hooked&quot; on portraits, through which she melded those aspects she found most intriguing in her subject with elements of herself, according to Mary Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Street Women&quot; (page 138)

Elaine employed a wide range of virtuosic drawing and painting techniques: finely detailed pencil drawings and more free ink drawings, crosshatching, erasure, stumping, and improvisational graphic lines, thin paint and impasto, âthin, dripping washes of bold colorâ¦â with many media: pencil, ink, charcoal, gouache, collage, mixed media, oil on paper, canvas and masonite.

&#x27;She achieves a sense of distinguishing facial features and captures each subject&#x27;s presence with sharp, jagged strokes of paintâ¦ A drawing of [her brother] Conrad from 1951 presents [his] head and shoulders against a dark background, with a combination of careful lines and darker strokes defining a contemplative figure with great subtlety.â

In regard to her portraiture, Elaine de Kooning wrote, &quot;when I painted my seated men, I saw them as gyroscopes. Portraiture always fascinated me because I love the particular gesture of a particular expression or stance ... Working on the figure, I wanted paint to sweep through as feelings sweep through...&quot; She studied each person &quot;to find the characteristic pose that would define them.&quot; Elaine de Kooning made portraits of men in her life, such as her husband Willem de Kooning and gallery owner Charles Egan, with whom she had an affair while he was representing her husband Willem de Kooning. A great example of this is the series of studies and finished portraits of President John F. Kennedy, which was the most important commission in her career. De Kooning also did a series of men with children, and a series of women after she resumed painting a year after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s death.

=== New Mexico ===
In the fall of 1958, until late spring of 1959 Elaine got a teaching appointment as visiting professor at the University of New Mexico. This gave her the opportunity to immerse herself in the characteristic color and space of the Southwestern landscape. She visited Juarez, Mexico where she attended many bullfights. She created a series of painting inspired by the theme with bold and bright colors. She wrote that &quot;the cottonwood trees and aspens had turned an overwhelming gold&quot; and that &quot;New England mountains are so well planted, but the New Mexico mountains seems to move toward you&quot;. During her stay she travelled to Santa Fe and visited Georgia O Keeffe. She described her as a &quot;grand old gal&quot; who &quot;looks like a monk and was very witty in a dry sort of way&quot;.

She started to experiment with acrylic paint during that period. She made connections with students such as William Conger and became friends with artists Joan Oppenheimer, Connie Fox or Margaret Randall. She also got involved with Robert Mallary, a fellow instructor.

=== Bacchus series===

The Bacchus series of paintings and watercolors that Elaine de Kooning generated over seven years began in 1976. She was captivated by a 19th-century sculpture of the Roman god Bacchus, which she saw in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. She particularly admired the sculptureâs twisting, dynamic form, which portrays the commotion created by the drunken god and his equally inebriated attendants. It was the first time she ever used acrylic paint.

=== Later works ===
In 1983 Elaine visited the paleolithic cave paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain and produced a series of paintings titled Cave Walls. In Paleolithic art she found the roots of Abstract Expressionism, since they have the same improvisational processes and spontaneous technique. In other words, &quot;she found Paleolithic art close in spirit to twentieth-century art.&quot;

In 1985 when Elaine de Kooning visited the cave in the Spanish Pyrenees, she realized that the geological formations and textures of the cave wall were the same as her ground of flying color, drips, washes, and strokes, animal forms and drawing rising out of its contours; giving her the affirmation to her own way of working. These series of paintings were shown at the Fischbach Gallery in November 1988, three months before her death.

===Exhibitions===

In 1951 De Kooning was included in the 9th Street Art Exhibition.

De Kooning&#x27;s work has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions as well as in a multitude of group shows in commercial art galleries as well as in major art museums and institutions. The artist&#x27;s work has received increasing critical acclaim posthumously, resulting in exhibitions such as the major museum show &quot;Elaine De Kooning: Portraits&quot; hosted by the National Portrait Gallery in 2015 in Washington, DC.

==Death==
De Kooning died on February 1, 1989, in Southampton, New York, a year after having a lung removed due to lung cancer.

==Legacy==
Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinciâs &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. Elaine was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.&quot;

In 2015, the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center hosted &quot;Elaine de Kooning Portrayed,&quot; an exhibition dedicated to portraits, likenesses, and reflections on de Kooning by other artists, including her husband Willem as well as Arshile Gorky, Fairfield Porter, Hedda Sterne, Alex Katz, Robert De Niro, Sr., Ray Johnson, Joop Sanders, Paul Harris, and Edvins Strautman.

In 2016 de Kooning was included in the exhibition &quot;Women of Abstract Expressionism&quot; at the Denver Art Museum.

In 2017 de Kooning was one of the subjects of the book &quot;Ninth Street Women: Lee Krasner, Elaine de Kooning, Grace Hartigan, Joan Mitchell, and Helen Frankenthaler: Five Painters and the Movement That Changed Modern Art&quot; by Mary Gabriel.
De Kooning&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In 2023 her work was included in the exhibition &quot;Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-1970&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery in London.

One of the few residences owned by Elaine de Kooning during her lifetime was a studio at Alewive Brook Road in East Hampton. The current owners are reportedly developing an artists&#x27; residency/alternative exhibition space referred to as &quot;the Elaine de Kooning house.&quot;

<doc id="703383" wikidata="Q836754" url="?curid=703383" title="Duke of Bourbon">
<text>Duke of Bourbon () is a title in the peerage of France. It was created in the first half of the 14th century for the eldest son of Robert of France, Count of Clermont, and Beatrice of Burgundy, heiress of the lordship of Bourbon. In 1416, with the death of John of Valois, the Dukes of Bourbon were simultaneously Dukes of Auvergne.

Although the senior line came to an end in 1527, the cadet branch of La Marche-Vendome would later succeed to the French throne as the Royal House of Bourbon, which would later spread out to other kingdoms and duchies in Europe. After this date, the title was given to several Princes of CondÃ© and sons of the French Royal family.

==Dukes of Bourbon==
===First creation: 1327â1523 â House of Bourbon===
# 1327â1341 : Louis I, Duke of Bourbon (1279â1341), &quot;the lame&quot; or &quot;the great&quot;, father of
# 1341â1356 : Peter I, Duke of Bourbon (1311â1356), father of 
# 1356â1410 : Louis II, Duke of Bourbon (1337â1410), father of
# 1410â1434 : John I, Duke of Bourbon (1381â1434), father of
# 1434â1456 : Charles I, Duke of Bourbon (1401â1456), father of
# 1456â1488 : John II, Duke of Bourbon (1426â1488), brother of
# 1488â1488 : Charles II, Duke of Bourbon (1434â1488), Cardinal and Archbishop of Lyons, brother of
# 1488â1503 : Peter II, Duke of Bourbon (1438â1503), father of
# 1503â1521 : Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon (1491â1521), wife of
# 1505â1523 : Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (1490â1527), Count of Montpensier and Dauphin of Auvergne

For most of their history, the dukes of Bourbon were closely allied to their royal Valois cousins. This allowed them to maintain their rank with comparable prestige. They fought against the English in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and took the side of the Armagnac faction during the ArmagnacâBurgundian Civil War.

Peter II and his wife, Anne, daughter of Louis XI, had only one surviving child, Suzanne. They made her their heir through a concession from Louis XII. Anne, knowing that the Bourbon-Montpensier branch, the next senior branch of the Bourbon family, would pursue their claim, married her daughter to Charles, Count of Montpensier. Their marriage thus consolidated the vast possessions of the Bourbon family. The project, however, failed. Suzanne died childless, and the new king&#x27;s mother, Louise of Savoy, claimed her inheritance, as heir by proximity of blood. Louise offered to marry the duke of Bourbon to settle the matter amicably. But Louise of Savoy was already 45 years old, so the duke refused her, with insulting language. The king sided with his mother, driving the duke into a conspiracy with the Emperor and the King of England. Once discovered, he was stripped of his titles and possessions in 1523. With his death in 1527, the line of Bourbon-Montpensier became extinct in the male line. The next senior line, of Bourbon-VendÃ´me, was not allowed to inherit the forfeited lands.





Therefore, the heir male of the Bourbon family belonged to the House of Bourbon-VendÃ´me from 1527 onwards, in the person of Charles de Bourbon, Duke of VendÃ´me until he died in 1537. Charles remained loyal to the king, even though Francis I had denied him the Bourbon inheritance and the inheritance of his wife, the sister of Charles IV, Duke of AlenÃ§on. Charles&#x27;s son, Antoine, became king of Navarre, and his grandson, Henry IV, became king of France. All of the present-day family members descend from him. As the new reigning dynasty, the House of Bourbon-VendÃ´me was simply called the House of Bourbon.

===1523â1531 â House of Savoy===

In 1523, Louise of Savoy, mother of King Francis I of France, challenged the succession to the estate of Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who died childless. She claimed the succession as the heir by proximity of blood, as a descendant of the House of Bourbon through her mother. Seeing no hope of prevailing against the king&#x27;s mother, the Constable of Bourbon went into the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1531, the duchy merged into the royal domain for the first time.

*1523â1531: Louise of Savoy, Duchess &quot;suo jure&quot; of Auvergne and Bourbon, Duchess of Nemours (1476â1531)

===Second and third creation: 1544â1574 â House of Valois===

The title was vacant til 1544 and then created for Charles II de Valois, the youngest and third son of King FranÃ§ois I of France and Claude, Duchess of Brittany. Being already Duke of AngoulÃªme and then Duke of Orleans, he received in 1544 the duchy as a prerogative, but the prince died soon after. When he died, the duchy returned to the Crown. The title was again vacant between 1544 and 1566. In 1566, for the second and final time, the Duchy of Bourbon constituted part of an apanage, in this case that of the Duke of AngoulÃªme, Duke of Orleans and Duke of Anjou and then future Henry III. Upon his accession to the throne in 1574, the duchy returned to the Crown.

*1544â1545: Charles II de Valois, Duke of OrlÃ©ans (1522â1545), youngest and third son of Francis I of France. He died childless and the title returned to the crown.
*1566â1574: Henry, Duke of Anjou (1551â1589), younger brother of Charles IX of France. He succeeded to the throne in 1574, and his titles merged into the crown.

===Fourth creation: 1661â1830 â House of Bourbon-CondÃ©===
The title went vacant for almost a hundred years until granted in 1661 to Louis, Grand CondÃ©, a French general and the most illustrious representative of the CondÃ© branch of the House of Bourbon. However, he and most of his descendants preferred to use their ancient courtesy title, Prince of CondÃ©. The title of Duke of Bourbon thereby became a courtesy title, used by the heir of the Prince of CondÃ©.

*1661â1667: Louis, Grand CondÃ© (1621â1686), also Duke of Enghien and Prince of CondÃ©
*1667â1670: Henri de Bourbon (1667â1670), grandson of preceding, died in infancy
*1670â1709: Louis, Duke of Bourbon (1668â1710), brother of preceding, afterwards Prince of CondÃ©
*1709â1736: Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (1692â1740), son of preceding, afterwards Prince of CondÃ©
*1736â1772: Louis Joseph, Prince of CondÃ© (1736â1818), son of preceding, afterwards Prince of CondÃ©
*1756â1830: Louis Henri, Prince of CondÃ© (1756â1830), son of preceding, afterwards Prince of CondÃ©. At his death in 1830, the House of CondÃ© became extinct.

=== Without legal creation: 1950âpresent â House of Bourbon-Anjou===
The Spanish branch of the Bourbons adopted the title of Duke of Bourbon since 1950, symbolizing the fact that it is the eldest branch of the Bourbon family and of all Capetians. As France today is a republic, the title has no legal basis.

* 1950â1975: Alphonse de Bourbon (1936â1989), afterwards Duke of Anjou, also Duke of CÃ¡diz
* 1975â1984: FranÃ§ois de Bourbon (1972â1984), son of preceding, formerly Duke of Brittany
* 1984â1989: Louis Alphonse de Bourbon (1974âpresent), brother of preceding, formerly Duke of Touraine, afterwards Duke of Anjou

<doc id="703386" wikidata="Q266309" url="?curid=703386" title="Robert, Count of Clermont">
<text>Robert of Clermont (1256 â 7 February 1317) was a French &quot;prince du sang&quot; who was created Count of Clermont in 1268. He was the sixth and last son of King Louis IX (Saint Louis) and Margaret of Provence.

Although he played a minor role in his lifetime due to a head injury which left him handicapped at a young age, he had an important dynastic position as the founder of the House of Bourbon, to which he passed the rights to the throne of France from his father when all male-line branches descended from his elder brothers died out in 1589, nine generations after him.

==Early life==
Robert was born in 1256 as the sixth and youngest son of King Louis IX of France (Saint Louis) and Margaret of Provence. Robert&#x27;s godfather, chosen by Louis IX, was Humbert of Romans, the Dominican Master of the Order at the time of Robert&#x27;s birth.

==Marriage and children==
In 1272, Robert married Beatrice of Burgundy, heiress of Bourbon and had the following issue:
*Louis I, &quot;le Boiteux&quot; (1279â1341), first Duke of Bourbon.
*Blanche of Clermont (1281â1304); married in 1303 in Paris Robert VII, Count of Auvergne and Boulogne, grandmother of Joan I, Countess of Auvergne.
*John of Clermont (1283â1316), Baron of Charolais; married c. 1309 Jeanne d&#x27;Argues, widow of Hugh, Count of Soissons, and had issue.
*Mary of Clermont (1285â1372, Paris), Prioress of 
*Peter of Clermont (1287 â aft. 1330), Archdeacon of Paris
*Margaret of Clermont (1289â1309, Paris); married firstly, in 1305, Raymond Berengar of Andria, and secondly, in 1308, John I, Marquis of Namur.

==Health problems==
During his first joust, in 1279, Robert suffered head injuries which rendered him an invalid for the remainder of his life.

<text>Kaitaia () is a town in the Far North District of New Zealand, at the base of the AupÅuri Peninsula, about 160Â km northwest of WhangÄrei. It is the last major settlement on State Highway 1. Ahipara Bay, the southern end of Te Oneroa-a-TÅhÄ / Ninety Mile Beach, is west.

The name &quot;KaitÄia&quot; means &#x27;ample food&#x27;, &quot;kai&quot; being the MÄori word for food.

The Muriwhenua are a group of six northern MÄori iwi occupying the northernmost part of the North Island surrounding Kaitaia.

==History and culture==

===European settlement===

The Kaitaia Mission Station was established between 1833 and 1834 after a series of visits by Church Missionary Society (CMS) representatives including Samuel Marsden, and at different times, Joseph Matthews and William Gilbert Puckey. Puckey and Matthews had married two sisters, Matilda and Mary Ann Davis respectively, (daughters of Richard Davis, a lay missioner based at Waimate North). They formed a tight band, initially living together in raupo huts, and then in houses they built.

As Puckey and the sisters were fluent in MÄori, (Puckey having arrived in New Zealand in 1819 with his father, William Puckey, and the Davis family in 1823), they spoke MÄori when together, to help Joseph Matthews pick up the language. Both families grew and intermarried, forming the basis of the early PÄkehÄ settler community. At one point, the Church Missionary Society decided that either Puckey or Matthews should move to a new location to the south to facilitate the spread of the word, but NÅpera Panakareao wrote a heartfelt letter to the CMS committee, pleading not to take away &#x27;one of the two candlesticks&#x27;.

In February 1841, about 500 MÄori were present at a CMS service. In 1852 arguments developed between one chief and his tribe, however the impact of the missionaries meant that the old ways of settling disputes had passed.

Richard Matthews, the brother of Rev. Joseph Matthews, arrived in the Bay of Islands in December 1835 and for a time, joined his brother in Kaitaia. Richard Matthews had been a lay missionary on the second voyage of &quot;HMS Beagle&quot; with Charles Darwin. Richard Matthews served the CMS as a lay catechist at Kaitaia. In 1838 he married Johanna Blomfield, the sister of Mrs Martha Blomfield Clarke, whose husband George was a CMS missionary at Te Waimate mission. In 1840 Richard and Johanna Matthews helped set up a missionary station at Whanganui.

There were plans to extend the Okaihau Branch railway to Kaitaia and construction was started in the 1920s, but with the line nearly complete to Rangiahua, a review in 1936 determined that the line would not be viable and construction was abandoned. The line terminated in Okaihau until it was closed on 1 November 1987. D 221, a steam tank locomotive, has been on static display at Centennial Park since 1967.

=== 21st century ===
In October 2020, a fire occurred at the former Kaitaia Bowling Club on Matthews Avenue. Alarms were raised at 6:01am on Friday. The fire was caused by an electrical fault that had sparked in the kitchen area on the upper floor, causing the northern half of the building to burn. The building, prior to the blaze, was used as a residential dwelling. 

A few months later in March 2021, the building was set on fire again, causing the entire building to set ablaze. Alarms were raised at around 2:30pm. Police suspected that the blaze was &#x27;deliberately lit&#x27;. The building was demolished upon the closing of the property.

<text>Louis I, called the Lame (1279 â 1341) was a French &quot;prince du sang&quot;, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and La Marche and the first Duke of Bourbon, as well as briefly the titular King of Thessalonica from 1320 to 1321.

==Life==
Louis was born in Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, the son of Robert, Count of Clermont, and a grandson of King Louis IX of France. Louis&#x27; mother was Beatrix of Burgundy, heiress of Bourbon and a granddaughter of Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy.

He fought on the losing side at the Battle of the Golden Spurs (1302) and at the Battle of Mons-en-PÃ©vÃ¨le (1304), but managed to escape unharmed. In 1310, he was made Grand Chambrier of France. Louis was &quot;crucesignatus&quot; in 1316 founding a confraternity called the Holy Selpulchre. On 13 September 1318, Philip V of France designated Louis, who had drawn up a preliminary crusading plan, as captain-general of his crusading army, however the loss of the Franco-Papal fleet in 1319 to the Ghibbelines at Genoa sidelined their efforts.

On 14 April 1320, Louis offered 40,000 livres to Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy for the rights to the title King of Thessalonica, however Philip of Taranto stepped in and offered the same amount which Odo accepted. The terms of the agreement also included the marriage of Philip&#x27;s oldest son and Louis&#x27; daughter, Beatrice.

In 1327, Charles IV of France persuaded Louis to exchange the County of Clermont for that of La Marche, and elevated Bourbon to a duchy-peerage. By 1331, Clermont was restored to him since he was part of Philip VI&#x27;s small circle of trusted advisors. Louis continued to be an integral part of French crusading plans until 1336, when Pope Benedict XII cancelled Philip VI&#x27;s crusade.

Duke Louis is reported to have been somewhat mentally unstable, in particular having nervous breakdowns. The trait is believed to have been hereditary, with his granddaughter Joanna of Bourbon, her son, King Charles VI of France, and Charles&#x27; grandson, King Henry VI of England, all displaying similar symptoms.

He was buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris.

==Family and children==
In 1310, Louis married Mary of Avesnes, daughter of John II of Avesnes, Count of Hainaut and Holland by Philippa of Luxembourg. They had:
*Peter I, Duke of Bourbon (1311â1356), married Isabella of Valois, had issue. Peter was killed at the Battle of Poitiers.
*Joanna (1312â1402), married in 1324 Guigues VII, Count of Forez.
*Margaret (1313â1362), married on 6 July 1320 Jean II de Sully, married in 1346 Hutin de Vermeilles.
*Marie (1315â1387, Naples), married first in Nicosia in January 1330 Guy of Lusignan (d. 1343), titular Prince of Galilee, married second on 9 September 1347 Robert of Taranto, the titular Latin Emperor.
*Philip (1316 â aft. 1327).
*James (1318).
*James I, Count of La Marche (1319â1362), killed at the Battle of Brignais.
*Beatrice (1320 â 23 December 1383, Danvillers), married first at Vincennes in 1334 John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia as his second wife, married secondly c. 1347 Eudes II of Grancey (d. 1389).

With Jeanne de Bourbon-Lancy, dame de Clessy, Louis had several illegitimate children:

* Jean (&quot;ca&quot;. 1297â1375), &quot;bÃ¢tard de Bourbon&quot;, knight, seigneur of Rochefort, Ãbreuil, BeÃ§ay le GuÃ©rant, Bellenave, Jenzat, Serrant and la Bure, advisor to the dukes of Berry and Bourbon, lieutenant du Forez, married AgnÃ¨s Chaleu for his third wife;
* &quot;N&quot; (eldest daughter), &quot;bÃ¢tarde de Bourbon&quot;, married in 1317 to Girard of ChÃ¢tillon-en-Bazois;
* Guy (vers 1299â1349), &quot;bÃ¢tard de Bourbon&quot;, seigneur of Clessy, la FertÃ©-Chauderon and Montpensier (legitimized in 1346, but that same year he was again bastardized). Married in 1315 AgnÃ¨s of Chastellus, then between 1330 and 1333 Isabelle of Chastelperron;
* Jeannette, &quot;bÃ¢tarde de Bourbon&quot;, married in 1310 to Guichard of Chastellus.

<doc id="703394" wikidata="Q444668" url="?curid=703394" title="Peter I, Duke of Bourbon">
<text>Peter I of Bourbon (Pierre Ier, Duc de Bourbon in French; 1311 â 19 September 1356) was the second Duke of Bourbon, from 1342 to his death. Peter was son of Louis I of Bourbon, whom he also succeeded as Grand Chamberlain of France, and Mary of Avesnes.

Peter is reported to have been somewhat mentally unstable, a trait of nervous breakdowns (presumably hereditary, if mental illness is hereditary) that showed clearly for example in his daughter Joan of Bourbon, the queen, and in her son, king Charles VI of France, as well as in Peter&#x27;s only surviving son, Duke Louis II.

==Early career==
Peter took part in several of the early campaigns of the Hundred Years War which broke out in 1337. In the summer of 1339, he took part in Jean de Marigny, Bishop of Beauvais&#x27;s failed attack on Bordeaux. In autumn 1341 he took part in the John, Duke of Normandy&#x27;s campaign in Brittany. He was present at the coronation of Pope Clement VI at Avignon 19 May 1342.

By the summer 1342, Peter together with the Raoul I of Brienne, Count of Eu, was given command of the covering force protecting France from attacks from the north while King Philip VI campaigned in Brittany. In August 1343 he and the Dauphin of Viennois were the French ambassadors at a peace conference at Avignon, but the negotiations were fruitless, as Edward III of England declined to send any but the most junior members of the embassy.

==Lieutenant in Languedoc==

On 8 August 1345 Peter was appointed by Philip VI as his lieutenant on the south-west march. His opponent was to be Henry, Earl of Derby (later Earl and Duke of Lancaster) who completed disembarking his army at Bordeaux the day after Peter&#x27;s appointment.

Peter arrived to take up his lieutenancy in Languedoc in September. By then the Earl of Derby had already opened his campaign, throwing the French defences into disarray with the capture of Bergerac and the destruction of the French army present there the previous month. Bourbon set up headquarters at AngoulÃªme and begun an extensive recruitment campaign to raise a new army, command of which fell to the Duke of Normandy. However on 21 October the Earl of Derby won another crushing victory outside Auberoche over parts of this force. The Duke of Normandy abandoned his campaign once he heard the news. In early November he disbanded his army and left for the north.

The Earl of Derby exploited the absence of a French commander in the field to lay siege to the important fortress-city of La RÃ©ole. Bourbon proclaimed the arriÃ¨re-ban in Languedoc and the march provinces in an attempt to find troops to relieve the siege. However the results were poor as many of the potential recruits were still on their way home from the army just disbanded by John of Normandy. Attempts by John I, Count of Armagnac to raise troops from his domains in the Rouergue also produced little. Early January 1346 the garrison of La RÃ©ole marched away under truce.

Winter 1346 Bourbon kept his winter quarters at the provincial capital of Agen, a city which quickly was becoming isolated as many of the lesser towns were captured or defected to the English. Spring however opened with the so far greatest French effort in the south-west. Bourbon and the Bishop of Beauvais raised a new army at Toulouse, in part financed by the Pope whose nephew had been captured by Derby the previous year, while John of Normandy brought with him a substantial number of nobles from the north including such dignitaries as the Eudes IV, Duke of Burgundy, Raoul II of Brienne, Count of Eu the Constable of France, both Marshals and the Master of Crossbowmen. In April Normandy laid siege to the town of Aiguillon which controlled the confluence of the Lot and the Garonne. There they still remained in August when John of Normandy was urgently recalled to the north to help stop Edward III who had landed in Normandy. Derby exploited this with a devastating autumn campaign. And so the French 1346 campaign in the south ended having accomplished nothing.

==Diplomatic missions==
In July 1347 he took part in fruitless negotiations with the English outside Calais in the days just before that city&#x27;s capitulation.

On 8 February 1354, Peter was together with the Guy, Cardinal of Boulogne appointed as King John II&#x27;s commissioners to King Charles II of Navarre, empowered to offer whatever Charles wanted. The two met the King of Navarre in the castle of Mantes, accompanied by the two dowager Queens and droves of courtiers and ministers, most of who more or less openly sympathized with Charles of Navarre. The treaty concluded 22 February granted to Charles of Navarre a considerable part of Lower Normandy which he was to hold with the same rights as the Duke of Normandy.

In January 1355, Peter was sent together with the Chancellor of France Pierre de la ForÃªt on a diplomatic mission to Avignon where they were to meet with an English embassy led by Henry of Lancaster and Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel. The purpose of the mission was to formally ratify a peace treaty based on a draft drawn up at GuÃ®nes the previous year. However since then French policy had changed, the French ambassadors had only come to reject the English demands and had nothing new to offer. Negotiations therefore quickly broke down and the conference ended having accomplished nothing except prolonging the existing truce a few more months until 24 June.

May 1355 when it became apparent that open war was about to break out between the King of France and a King of Navarre allied to England the Duke of Bourbon belonged to the party fronted by the Dowager Queens who lobbied John II on Charles of Navarre&#x27;s behalf. In the end John II gave way and on 31 May agreed to pardon Charles of Navarre.

In July the Duke of Bourbon and the Chancellor met with English ambassadors to negotiate the extension of the truce. As both the French and English governments had decided to resume the war these negotiations were naturally quite empty and fruitless.

Peter was killed in the Battle of Poitiers 19 September 1356 and buried in the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris.

==Marriage and issue==
On 25 January 1336 he married Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles, Count of Valois and his third wife Mahaut of ChÃ¢tillon. Peter and Isabella had:
*Louis II (1337â1410)
*Joanna (1338â1378), married King Charles V of France
*Blanche (1339â1361, Medina-Sidonia), married King Pedro of Castile in 1353 in Valladolid, poisoned by her husband
*Bonne (1341 â 19 January 1402, ChÃ¢teau de MÃ¢con), married Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1355 in Paris
*Catherine (1342â1427, Paris), married John VI of Harcourt
*Margaret (1344â1416), married Arnaud Amanieu, Viscount of Tartas
