<text>Gotha () is the fifth-largest city in Thuringia, Germany, west of Erfurt and east of Eisenach with a population of 44,000. The city is the capital of the district of Gotha and was also a residence of the Ernestine Wettins from 1640 until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha originating here spawned many European rulers, including the royal houses of the United Kingdom, Belgium, Portugal (until 1910) and Bulgaria (until 1946).

In the Middle Ages, Gotha was a rich trading town on the trade route &quot;Via Regia&quot; and between 1650 and 1850, Gotha saw a cultural heyday as a centre of sciences and arts, fostered by the dukes of Saxe-Gotha. The first duke, Ernest the Pious, was famous for his wise rule. In the 18th century, the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; was first published in the city. The publisher Justus Perthes and the encyclopedist Joseph Meyer made Gotha a leading centre of German publishing around 1800. In the early 19th century, Gotha was a birthplace of the German insurance business. The SPD was founded in Gotha in 1875 by merging two predecessors. In that period Gotha became an industrial centre, with companies such as the &quot;Gothaer Waggonfabrik&quot;, a producer of trams and later aeroplanes.

The main sights of Gotha are the early-modern Friedenstein Castle, one of the largest Renaissance Baroque castles in Germany, the medieval city centre and the Gründerzeit buildings of 19th-century commercial boom.

Gotha lies in the southern part of the Thuringian Basin in a flat and agricultural landscape.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
Gotha has existed at least since the 8th century, when it was mentioned in a document signed by Charlemagne as &quot;Villa Gotaha&quot; (Old High German &quot;gotaha&quot; meaning &quot;good waters&quot;) in 775. The first settlement was probably located around today&#x27;s &quot;Hersdorfplatz&quot; outside the north-eastern edge of the later city centre. During the 11th century, the nearby Ludowingians received the village and established the city in the late 12th century, as Gotha became their second most important city after Eisenach. The city generated wealth because it was conveniently located at the junction of two important long-distance trade routes: the Via Regia from Mainz and Frankfurt to Leipzig and Breslau and a north–south route from Mühlhausen over the Thuringian Forest to Franconia. One of the oldest pieces of evidence of busy trade in the city is the &quot;Gotha cache of coins&quot; with nearly 800 Bracteates, buried in 1185 in the central city. In 1180, Gotha was first mentioned as a city, when the area between &quot;Brühl&quot; and &quot;Jüdenstraße&quot; became the core of urban development, highlighting the early presence of Jews in this old trading town.

The parish church of this first urban settlement was St. Mary&#x27;s Church (demolished in 1530) at &quot;Schlossberg&quot;. The castle (at the site occupied today by Friedenstein Castle) was first mentioned in 1217. As the Ludowingians died out in 1247, Gotha became part of the Wettins&#x27; territories, where it remained until 1918. The &quot;new town&quot; east of &quot;Querstraße&quot; was established in the early 15th century (with the &quot;Neumarkt&quot;, first mentioned in 1428).

The monastery (first Cistercians, since 1258 Augustinians) was founded before 1251 and abandoned in 1525. Until 1665, the bourse of Gotha was located in the centre of &quot;Hauptmarkt&quot; square inside the Renaissance building, which hosts the town hall today. The medieval town hall was located on the north-eastern edge of Hauptmarkt, at the site of today&#x27;s &quot;Innungshalle&quot;.

Water supply was a big problem, because Gotha is not located on a river. In 1369, Landgrave Balthasar had the Leinakanal built. This channel, over 25 kilometres long, brought fresh water from the Thuringian Forest (Hörsel and Apfelstädt rivers) to the city. The main businesses of medieval Gotha were cloth-making and the woad trade.

=== Early modern period ===

The Reformation was introduced in Gotha in 1524 and the castle was rebuilt as a larger fortress between 1530 and 1541. Gotha was already part of the Ernestine Wettins territory after the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig. However, the Ernestines&#x27; loss of power after the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, the Treaty of Erfurt in 1572, when the city became part of Saxe-Coburg, and the Thirty Years&#x27; War resulted in Gotha&#x27;s decline. The local castle, &quot;Grimmenstein&quot;, was razed by Imperial troops in 1572.

The turnaround was brought about by the selection of Gotha as a ducal residence in the 1640 territorial partition, when Ernest the Pious founded the duchy of Saxe-Gotha. The strongly Protestant and absolutist sovereign quickly began to reorganize his small state (even before the war had ended) and in particular fostered the school system, for example by introducing compulsory education up to the age of 12 in 1642. This was the origin of the often noted liberal education of the Gotha citizenry and the following cultural heyday.

Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff was one of numerous experienced and loyal civil servants employed by the duke. Seckendorff was considered one of the most able and influential thinkers on administration and public law of his time. His book &quot;Der teutsche Fürstenstaat&quot; (1656), written by order of Ernest, served for decades as a standard work in teaching political science at Protestant universities in Germany.

Friedenstein Castle was built between 1643 and 1654 and is one of the first large Baroque residence castles in Germany. Between 1657 and 1676, the city received a stronger fortification, which was demolished between 1772 and 1811. In their place, a park around Friedenstein and a boulevard around the city were established. Some important scientific institutions were the ducal library (today&#x27;s &quot;Forschungsbibliothek Gotha&quot; as part of the University of Erfurt), founded in 1650, the &quot;coin cabinet&quot; (1712), the &quot;art and natural collection&quot;, basis of today&#x27;s museums, and the Gotha Observatory at Seeberg mountain, established 1788. The Gotha porcelain manufactory (established in 1767) was famous around 1800 for their faiences.

In 1774, the actor group led by Conrad (or Konrad) Ekhof, called &quot;the father of German acting&quot;, came from Weimar to Gotha. He began working at the &quot;Schlosstheater&quot; and became &quot;Direktor&quot; of the first ever German court theatre (founded in 1683), while acting in many plays himself. Having turned it into one of the leading theatres in Germany, after his death in 1778 the fame of the theatre declined rapidly.

The &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;, a directory of European royalty and nobility, was first published in 1763 and Justus Perthes founded his science publishing company in 1785. Joseph Meyer followed in 1826 by founding the &quot;Bibliographisches Institut&quot;, one of the two leading encyclopedia publishers in the German language besides the Brockhaus and Adolf Stieler first published his &quot;Handatlas&quot; in Gotha in 1816. Johann Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the order of the Illuminati, died in Gotha in 1830. It was also during this time, that the city developed a sizeable Jewish population.

=== Since 1815 ===
From 1826 to 1918, Gotha along with Coburg was one of the two capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Under the rule of Duke Ernest II, Gotha was a centre of Germany&#x27;s liberal movement, where the Gothaer Nachparlament, an aftermath of 1848 German Revolution took place. After 1851, Gustav Freytag, novelist, advocate of German unity and often a harsh critic of Otto von Bismarck made Siebleben (today part of Gotha) his summer home. Ernest II made Freytag &quot;Hofrat&quot; (privy councillor) in 1854, when the Prussian government had issued a warrant for his arrest.

In 1875, the German socialist party (SPD) was founded in Gotha through the merger of two organizations: the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party, led by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the General German Workers&#x27; Association, founded by Ferdinand Lassalle. A compromise known as the Gotha Program was forged, although it was strongly criticized by Karl Marx for its reformist bias in his &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;.

From 1876 to 1908, the novelist Kurd Lasswitz, sometimes referred to as &quot;the father of German science fiction&quot; worked as a teacher at Gotha&#x27;s Ernestinum, the oldest &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Thuringia.

Industrialization started in Gotha around 1850, as the city was connected to the Thuringian Railway in 1847. The city became a centre of engineering with companies like the &quot;Gothaer Waggonfabrik&quot;, a tram and airplane manufacturer, founded in 1883. During the 19th century, Gotha also became a centre of banking and the insurance business in Germany. Ernst-Wilhelm Arnoldi founded the first fire insurance in 1820, followed by the first life insurance in 1827. The mutual insurance remains one of the largest insurance companies in Germany (it moved to Cologne after World War II). Gotha&#x27;s tram network was established in 1894. The first crematory in Germany was built in Gotha in 1878.

The Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), a left-wing breakaway of the SPD was founded in Gotha in 1917 in opposition to the SPD&#x27;s war policies during World War I. During the German Revolution, the Duke abdicated in 1918. A far-left government was elected in Gotha in 1919 and worked against both the Weimar National Assembly and the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch in 1920 bringing the city to the edge of a civil war. After a referendum, the state of Gotha joined the newly created &quot;Freistaat&quot; Thuringia in 1920.

Under Nazi rule, Gotha became a centre of the arms industry with nearly 7,000 forced labourers working in the city&#x27;s factories, where more than 200 died. The Gotha barracks in the southern periphery were enlarged and during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938 the synagogue was destroyed. Allied air raids in 1944/5 damaged some buildings in the city, in particular the state theatre (demolished by East German authorities in 1958) and the main station (which remains only &quot;half-a-building&quot;) and the main church (rebuilt after the war). Nevertheless, some 95% of the city&#x27;s buildings survived the war unscathed. Jewish slave laborers working in quarries at Gotha were all murdered by their Nazi overseers on 4 April 1945, just before the city was captured by American forces.

The American Army reached the city in April 1945 but was replaced by the Soviets in July 1945 and in 1949 Gotha became part of the GDR. During this period, some historic inner-city quarters were replaced by &quot;Plattenbau&quot; buildings, especially west of the Hauptmarkt and at Gartenstraße north of the city centre. Many other buildings fell derelict during the later GDR period and the city&#x27;s time of shrinking in the 1990s, whereas others were refurbished after German reunification in 1990. Gotha&#x27;s economy was hit by the transition from state to market economy after 1990, nevertheless, some companies survived or were newly founded and have made Gotha economically a relatively successful city.

== Geography and demographics ==

=== Topography ===

Gotha is situated in a flat landscape within the fertile Thuringian Basin. A tectonic dislocation traverses the city from north-west to south-east. Thereby, it forms three prominent hills: the 431 m high &quot;Krahnberg&quot; with the &quot;Ratsholz&quot; forest in the north-west, the hill of Friedenstein Castle in the city centre and the 409 m high &quot;Seeberg&quot; in the south-east. The city itself lies at an elevation of 300 m and the municipal territory is nearly free of forest (with the two named mountains as exceptions) and is in intensive agricultural use. As one out of only very few ancient cities in Germany, Gotha is not situated on a river, so that water supply was already a problem in the Middle Ages. For that reason, the &quot;Leinakanal&quot; was built in the 14th century over a distance of more than 25 kilometres, which was at the time an enormous task. The Leinakanal brings water from Hörsel and Apfelstädt river to Gotha, overcoming the watershed between Elbe (Apfelstädt) and Weser (Gotha). The drain of Leinakanal is the &quot;Flutgraben&quot;, a tributary of Nesse. The Thuringian Forest is located south-west of Gotha.

=== Administrative division ===
Gotha borders the following municipalities, which are all part of Gotha district: Goldbach, Remstädt, Bufleben, Friemar, Tüttleben, Drei Gleichen, Günthersleben-Wechmar, Schwabhausen, Emleben, Leinatal and Hörsel.

Gotha is divided in 11 districts. The urban districts are Mitte, Weststadt, West, Nord, Süd, Oststadt and Ost and the rural districts are Boilstädt (incorporated in 1994), Siebleben (1922), Sundhausen (1974) and Uelleben (1994).

=== Demographics ===

Gotha has long been one of the largest towns in Thuringia. During the Middle Ages, it was a town of 5,000 to 6,000 inhabitants and its selection as a ducal residence brought another impetus during the 17th and 18th century, so that Gotha had already more than 10,000 inhabitants by 1800. The number rose to 15,000 around 1850, as industrialisation started and the city was connected to the railway. The population saw a steady growth to 23,000 in 1875, 35,000 in 1900, 46,000 in 1925 and 58,000 in 1950, when the peak was reached. Until 1990, the population was roughly constant at around 57,000. After German reunification in 1990, the city saw a significant decline in population, it shrank to 48,000 by 2000 and to 44,000 by 2012. Between 2013 and 2016, the population rose in each consecutive year. In 2016 it reached 45,640.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was -0.05% p.a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Gotha. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas are situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the early 2000s, many inhabitants left Gotha to search for a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like Jena or Erfurt. Since 2005, emigration is not a big issue anymore. Today, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is becoming a bigger problem because immigration is not sufficient to compensate for it in recent years.

Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy was a problem with rates around 9% in 2011 but declined to 4% in 2017. A side effect of the high vacancy rate is Gotha&#x27;s low rent level.

The birth deficit was 175 in 2012, this is -3.9 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +6.2 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Gotha migrants are bordering rural areas of Thuringia as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like other eastern German cities, foreigners account for only a small share of Gotha&#x27;s population: circa 2.5% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 7.1% are classified as migrants (according to the 2011 EU census). In contrast to the national average, the largest groups of migrants in Gotha are Russians, Vietnamese and Ukrainians.

Due to the official atheism of the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 18.2% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 4.8% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Museums ===
Gotha hosts various museums, which are – together with the ducal buildings – promoted as the &quot;Gothaer Barock-Universum&quot; (&quot;Baroque universe of Gotha&quot;).
* Friedenstein Castle hosts the following museums:
** The &quot;Ekhof Theatre&quot; is a Baroque court theatre and the world&#x27;s only 17th century theatre with original stage machinery still working.
** The &quot;Historic Museum&quot; hosts an exhibition about municipal and regional history and culture of Gotha. 
** The &quot;Museum of Nature&quot; shows a natural history exhibition with animals, minerals and fossils. 
** The &quot;Castle Museum&quot; contains the former ducal living rooms and several items of cultural history. 
* The &quot;Ducal Museum&quot; opposite to the castle hosts the ducal collection of art, containing Egyptian antiques, Renaissance Old Masters paintings, Chinese and Meissen porcelaine and more. 
* The &quot;Insurance Museum&quot; at Bahnhofstraße is Germany&#x27;s only museum on the history of the insurance business, which has been important in Gotha since 1820.
* The &quot;Tivoli&quot; at Cosmarstraße is the place where the Social Democratic Party of Germany was founded and hosts a small exhibition on the party&#x27;s history.

=== Cityscape ===

The city centre of Gotha has two medieval parts: the old town around &quot;Hauptmarkt&quot; and the new town around &quot;Neumarkt&quot;. Both were walled until 1810, when the city walls were broken down and a boulevard was laid out in their place. Early-modern suburbiums were established to the south-west (around &quot;Dreikronengasse&quot;), to the west (around &quot;Große Fahnenstraße&quot;) and to the east (around &quot;Mohrenberg&quot;). The later 19th century brought larger growth in all directions. Especially the axis between the main station and the city centre received a representative development in capital-city style. Due to Gotha&#x27;s function as a ducal residence, most buildings built between 1870 and 1914 were generous in size and many mansions were built. Only some outer districts show the typical German working-class tenements (e.g. around &quot;Oststraße&quot; and &quot;Seebergstraße&quot;). The largest &quot;Plattenbau&quot; settlement of Gotha was established at the western periphery during the late GDR period. In the 1980s, large areas of the western old town were demolished and replaced by small-scale &quot;Plattenbau&quot; houses. After 1990, many buildings were thoroughly refurbished after having fallen into dereliction during GDR times. Nevertheless, a relatively large share of ruined historic buildings remains characteristic for Gotha (in comparison to neighbouring cities like Eisenach, Erfurt or Weimar), especially within the historic new town and the 19th century belt around the city centre. The government sometimes failed to conserve historic buildings, for example the &#x27; was demolished in 2007, as was the &#x27; in 2011 (although the latter has now being reconstructed externally). The &quot;&quot; was saved in 2006, and the &quot;Prinzenpalais&quot; was restored in 2017 although the adjacent &quot;Kavaliershaus&quot; was demolished.

* Many of the banks&#x27; and insurances&#x27; buildings of Gotha are also architecturally interesting. They were built during Gotha&#x27;s time as a centre of the finance industry around 1900. The &quot;Deutsche Grundkreditbank&quot; at Bahnhofstraße (1872–1877) was built by Ludwig Bohnstedt, as was the &quot;Gothaer Feuerversicherung&quot; (1872–1874) at Bahnhofstraße and the &quot;Gothaer Privatbank&quot; (1873–1877) at Ekhofplatz. The &quot;Gothaer Lebensversicherung&quot; (1893/94) was built by Bruno Eelbo at Bahnhofstraße and the &quot;Ducal Cashier&#x27;s Office&quot; (1908) at Justus-Perthes-Straße was built by Alfred Cramer.

* The Stadtbad Gotha is an Art Nouveau-style public bathhouse built in 1909 and restored in 2014.
* Perthesforum, opened in 2014, and containing the Perthes archives (185,000 maps, 120,000 geographical publications and approximately 800 metres business archives) of Justus Perthes (publishing company).

== Economy and infrastructure ==
During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate in the district declined from 17% in 2005 to 7% in 2013 with rates a bit higher in the city itself than in the other municipalities of the Gotha district.

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture is still important in the region around Gotha with its fertile soil. More than 60% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use for growing maize, crops, vegetables and sugar beets.

Vehicle construction is still the most important industry in Gotha. The well-known &quot;Gothaer Waggonfabrik&quot; had two successors after 1990: the &quot;Gothaer Fahrzeugwerke&quot;, a Schmitz Cargobull factory with 800 workers and the &quot;Gothaer Fahrzeugtechnik&quot;, a crane manufacturer with 400 employees. The brewery belongs to the Paulaner Brewery and has 300 employees. In 2012, there were 28 companies with more than 20 workers in the industrial sector, employing 3,300 people and generating a turnover of more than €850 million. The old industrial district is situated in the east of Gotha, a new one developed after 1990 in the south. Further, the neighbouring small towns of Waltershausen and Ohrdruf have strong industrial cores, where many commuters from Gotha have found work.

As a former state capital (until 1920) and then district capital, Gotha is also a hub of public and private services. The city centre hosts some retailing and at the south-western periphery the largest hospital of the region was built after reunification. The Friedenstein barracks are one of the largest Bundeswehr bases in Thuringia. In addition, the &quot;&quot;, a state historical archive, and the Land&#x27;s Financial Court have their seat in Gotha. Despite the various sights and the colourful history, tourism plays no important role in Gotha yet. In 2012, there were only 68,000 overnight guests staying for 154,000 nights in Gotha (compared to 310,000 in Eisenach, 650,000 in Weimar and 750,000 in Erfurt). Within the last decade there was no significant growth in tourism.

=== Transport ===


Gotha is connected by the Thuringian Railway to Erfurt and Leipzig in the east and to Frankfurt/Kassel in the west. Furthermore, there are some regional railways from Gotha to Leinefelde (via Mühlhausen) and to Gräfenroda (the latter out of service since 2011). Besides the main Gotha station, there is another one on the Gotha–Leinefelde railway: Gotha Ost in the north-eastern part of the city. Long-distance trains (ICE or IC) connect Gotha with Frankfurt in the west and Leipzig/Dresden in the east every two hours, as does a regional express train to Göttingen in the north-west and Zwickau/Glauchau in the east via Erfurt and Jena. The local trains to Eisenach in the west, Halle in the east (via Erfurt and Weimar) and Bad Langensalza in the north depart once an hour.

The two &quot;Autobahnen&quot; crossing nearby at &quot;Erfurter Kreuz&quot; are the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt–Dresden) and the Bundesautobahn 71 (Schweinfurt–Sangerhausen). Furthermore, there are two &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; connecting Gotha: the Bundesstraße 7 from Eisenach in the west to Erfurt in the east and the Bundesstraße 247 from Ohrdruf in the south to Mühlhausen in the north. Important secondary roads lead from Gotha to Bad Tennstedt in the north-east, to Arnstadt in the south-east, to Waltershausen in the south-west and to Goldbach in the north-west. An eastern bypass road to relieve the city centre of transit traffic along B 247 is in the planning process.

The Erfurt-Weimar Airport is situated 20 kilometres east of Gotha and in use for holiday flights to southern European tourist destinations. The next major airport is Frankfurt Airport, approximately to the south-west.

Biking is becoming more and more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourists there is the long-distance &quot;Radweg Thüringer Städtekette&quot; (Thuringian city string trail). It connects points of touristic interest along the medieval &quot;Via Regia&quot; from Eisenach via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar and Jena to Altenburg.

The public transport system consists of a tram network with three lines, connecting the city centre with the main station in the south-east, the east station in the north-east and the hospital in Sundhausen district in the south-west. A peculiarity is the long &quot;&quot; (established in 1929), one of Germany&#x27;s last traditional interurban tramway lines, to Bad Tabarz, Waltershausen and Friedrichroda. It is used both for everyday traffic and by tourists. Buses serve urban quarters and nearby villages lacking a tram or rail connection.

=== Education and research ===

There are three state-run &quot;Gymnasiums&quot; in Gotha, including the famous Ernestine Gymnasium. In addition, the &quot;Thüringer Fachhochschule für öffentliche Verwaltung&quot; (school of public administration) with 500 students has its seat in Gotha, as has the school of Thuringia&#x27;s ministry of finance and the school of Thuringia&#x27;s geodesy authority.

Research with focus on early modern history is carried out by the &quot;Forschungsbibliothek Gotha&quot;, the state archive and the &quot;Friedenstein Foundation&quot;, which also runs the museums at Friedenstein Castle.

<doc id="716861" wikidata="Q4384022" url="?curid=716861" title="Rudolf Gundlach">
<text>Rudolf Gundlach (1892–1957) was a Polish military engineer, inventor and tank designer. He headed the design division of the Armored Weapons Technical Research Bureau (&quot;Biuro Badań Technicznych Broni Pancernych&quot;). He held the military rank of major in the Corps of Engineers of the Polish Army.

He was the chief designer of the &quot;Ursus wz. 29&quot; armored car and supervised design work for the &quot;7TP&quot; light tank and the &quot;10TP&quot; fast tank prototype.

==Early life==
Rudolf Gundlach was born on 28 March 1892 in Wiskitki, Russian Empire (now Poland) into an Evangelical family. His father was a pastor. From 1903 to 1911, he attended a classical gymnasium in Łódź, and then entered the Riga Technical University where he studied until his conscription into the Russian Army in 1916. He graduated from a non-commissioned officers school of artillery and served in the 8th Heavy Artillery Brigade. In mid-1917, he became a member of the Union of Military Poles in Tartu. He organized an artillery unit for the Polish I Corps.

==Interwar Poland==
Gundlach enlisted into the Polish Army in November 1918. After graduating from the Automotive Officers School in Kraków in October 1919, he served as an adjutant in the Automotive Command Center in Łódź. He was appointed lieutenant in December 1919 and commanded a column of military vehicles during the Polish–Soviet War. In 1925, Gundlach finished his studies at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology, but failed to obtain the engineer&#x27;s degree (he didn&#x27;t take the diploma exam). In January 1930, he was promoted to the rank of captain, and in 1937 to the rank of major.

In interwar Poland, he worked in the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, as a clerk in the Institute of Engineering Research, and from 1931, was the head of the Armored Weapons Construction Bureau in the Army Research Institute for Engineering. In December 1934, he became the head of the Design and Construction Department in the Armoured Weapons Technical Research Bureau. He remained at this position until the outbreak of World War II. He was decorated with the Silver Cross of Merit.

==France==
After the fall of Poland in 1939, Gundlach was one of hundreds of thousand Polish soldiers, technicians, scientists and engineers who escaped to France via Romania. In France he worked in the Bureau of War Industry (&quot;Biuro Wojennego Przemysłu przy Ministerstwie Przemysłu&quot;), and in the Ministry of Industry of the Polish Government in Exile. After the fall of France, health problems prevented him from evacuating to Great Britain and he stayed in Vichy France for the remainder of the war.

After the end of World War II, Gundlach sought enforcement of intellectual property rights over his periscope, which had been copied in several countries and produced under different names. He was unsuccessful in the United States due to long and costly court proceedings, but managed to obtain a license fee from the British Royal Commission.

He received a large payment for his periscope patent from some of its producers. 
In 1947, he gained compensation from the British authorities, and a French court awarded him 84 million francs for the use of his invention by Barbier-Bernard. After paying the attorney&#x27;s fees, court costs, and taxes, he was left with 17 million francs, which allowed him to buy a villa in Le Vésinet near Paris. He established a bakery in 1953. His house served as a meeting place for Polish immigrants. He sold it in 1956 and moved to Colombes, where he died on 4 July 1957 and was buried at the local cemetery.

==Gundlach Rotary Periscope==
He is famous for his invention of the Gundlach Rotary Periscope (), patented in 1938, which made possible 360° vision. The periscope enabled an observer (e.g., the tank commander) to look forward (upper panel of the picture) or backward (lower panel) without moving his seat. Since it greatly increased the comfort of observer and widened the field of view, the new periscope design was used in virtually every tank built after 1940.

It was first implemented in TKS and 7TP Polish tanks. As a part of Polish-British pre-war military cooperation, the patent was sold to Vickers-Armstrong for one Polish Zloty / 1 PLN /. It was produced as Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV (pictured), and built into all British tanks (such as Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, Cromwell). After the fall of Poland, Germany, the USSR and Romania captured equipment, allowing them to copy the invention. In the USSR, the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). All Axis tanks and APC (including tanks of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Japan) were equipped or retro-fitted with this periscope until 1941. The technology was later transferred to the USA and implemented as the M6 periscope in all US tanks (M3/M5 Stuart, M4 Sherman and others). After the Second World War the technology was adopted thorough the whole world. Even today, original Gundlach periscopes are used in some tanks and APCs.

<doc id="716865" wikidata="Q6537712" url="?curid=716865" title="Lexicographic information cost">
<text>Lexicographic information cost is a concept within the field of lexicography. The term refers to the difficulties and inconveniences that the user of a dictionary believes or feels are associated with consulting a particular dictionary or dictionary article. For example, the extensive use of abbreviations in articles in order to save space may annoy the user, because it is often difficult to read such condensed texts and understand the abbreviations, thereby increasing the lexicographic information costs.

The important point in connection with lexicographic information costs is the relation between the information costs anticipated by the user and the information value the user expects to gain from consulting a dictionary or dictionary article. The more easily a user can navigate a dictionary and its articles, the lower the information costs and, hopefully, the more content with the dictionary the user will be. The higher the information costs of a dictionary, the more dissatisfied the user will be. There are two general types of lexicographic information costs: 
# the search costs are the efforts required by users when searching for something in dictionaries, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the look-up activities required to find what they are looking for; and
# the comprehension costs, which are the efforts required by users to understand and interpret the data in dictionaries.

The concept of lexicographic information costs was first proposed by the Danish scholar and metalexicographer Sandro Nielsen (see below). The concept is relevant to lexicographers when planning and compiling a dictionary; for the users when consulting the dictionary; and for reviewers when evaluating a dictionary.

<doc id="716868" wikidata="Q43715" url="?curid=716868" title="Vlad the Impaler">
<text>Vlad III, commonly known as Vlad the Impaler ( ) or Vlad Dracula (; ; 1428/31 – 1476/77), was Voivode of Wallachia three times between 1448 and his death in 1476/77. He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.

He was the second son of Vlad Dracul, who became the ruler of Wallachia in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, Radu, were held as hostages in the Ottoman Empire in 1442 to secure their father&#x27;s loyalty. Vlad&#x27;s eldest brother Mircea and their father were murdered after John Hunyadi, regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad&#x27;s second cousin, VladislavII, as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned, and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to Moldavia in 1449 or 1450 and later to Hungary.

Relations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents, Dan and Basarab Laiotă (who were Vladislav&#x27;s brothers), and Vlad&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother, Vlad Călugărul. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia, where he had them impaled (which inspired his epithet). Peace was restored in 1460.

The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan&#x27;s two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Muslim Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad&#x27;s younger brother, Radu. Vlad attempted to capture the sultan at Târgoviște during the night of 1617June 1462. The Sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.

Vlad was held in captivity in Visegrád from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of Stephen III of Moldavia in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus&#x27;s army against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiotă (who had dethroned Vlad&#x27;s brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10January 1477.

Books describing Vlad&#x27;s cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen his central government only by applying brutal punishments, and many 19th-century Romanian historians adopted a similar view. Vlad&#x27;s patronymic inspired the name of Bram Stoker&#x27;s literary vampire, Count Dracula.

== Name ==


The name &quot;Dracula&quot;, which is now primarily known as the name of a vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of VladIII. Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Dracuglia&quot;, or &quot;Drakula&quot; already in the 15thcentury. He himself signed his two letters as &quot;Dragulya&quot; or &quot;Drakulya&quot; in the late 1470s. His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul (&quot;Vlad the Dragon&quot; in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon. Dracula is the Slavonic genitive form of Dracul, meaning &quot;[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)&quot;. In modern Romanian, &quot;dracul&quot; means &quot;the devil&quot;, which contributed to Vlad&#x27;s reputation.

Vlad III is known as &quot;Vlad Țepeș&quot; (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography. This sobriquet is connected to the impalement that was his favorite method of execution. The Ottoman writer Tursun Beg referred to him as &quot;&quot; (Impaler Lord) around 1500. Mircea the Shepherd, Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1April 1551.

== Early life ==
Vlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was himself an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia. VladII had won the moniker &quot;Dracul&quot; for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a militant fraternity founded by Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary. The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe. Since he was old enough to be a candidate for the throne of Wallachia in 1448, Vlad&#x27;s time of birth would have been between 1428 and 1431. Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429. Historian Radu Florescu writes that Vlad was born in the Transylvanian Saxon town of Sighișoara (then in the Kingdom of Hungary), where his father lived in a three-story stone house from 1431 to 1435. Modern historians identify Vlad&#x27;s mother either as a daughter or kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia or as his father&#x27;s unknown first wife.

Vlad II Dracul seized Wallachia after the death of his half-brother Alexander I Aldea in 1436. One of his charters (which was issued on 20January 1437) preserves the first reference to Vlad III and his elder brother, Mircea, mentioning them as their father&#x27;s &quot;firstborn sons&quot;. They were mentioned in four further documents between 1437 and 1439. The last of the four charters also refers to their younger brother, Radu.

After a meeting with John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, Vlad II Dracul did not support an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania in March 1442. The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, ordered him to come to Gallipoli to demonstrate his loyalty. Vlad and Radu accompanied their father to the Ottoman Empire, where they were all imprisoned. Vlad Dracul was released before the end of the year, but Vlad and Radu remained hostages to secure his loyalty. They were held imprisoned in the fortress of Eğrigöz, Emit, according to contemporaneous Ottoman chronicles. Their lives were especially in danger after their father supported Vladislaus, King of Poland and Hungary, against the Ottoman Empire during the Crusade of Varna in 1444. Vlad II Dracul was convinced that his two sons would be &quot;butchered for the sake of Christian peace&quot;, but neither Vlad nor Radu was murdered or mutilated after their father&#x27;s rebellion.

Vlad Dracul again acknowledged the sultan&#x27;s suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute to him in 1446 or 1447. John Hunyadi (who had by then become the regent-governor of Hungary in 1446), invaded Wallachia in November 1447. The Byzantine historian Michael Critobulus wrote that Vlad and Radu fled to the Ottoman Empire, which suggests that the sultan had allowed them to return to Wallachia after their father paid homage to him. Vlad Dracul and his eldest son, Mircea, were murdered. Hunyadi made Vladislav II (son of Vlad Dracul&#x27;s cousin, Dan II) the ruler of Wallachia.

== Reigns ==

=== First rule ===
Upon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia. VladislavII of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448. Taking advantage of his opponent&#x27;s absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October. He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it.

The Ottomans defeated Hunyadi&#x27;s army in the Battle of Kosovo between 17and 18October. Hunyadi&#x27;s deputy, Nicholas Vízaknai, urged Vlad to come to meet him in Transylvania, but Vlad refused him. VladislavII returned to Wallachia at the head of the remnants of his army. Vlad was forced to flee to the Ottoman Empire by 7December 1448.

=== In exile ===
Vlad first settled in Edirne in the Ottoman Empire after his fall. Not long after, he moved to Moldavia, where BogdanII (his father&#x27;s brother-in-law and possibly his maternal uncle) had mounted the throne with John Hunyadi&#x27;s support in the autumn of 1449. After Bogdan was murdered by Peter III Aaron in October 1451, Bogdan&#x27;s son, Stephen, fled to Transylvania with Vlad to seek assistance from Hunyadi. However, Hunyadi concluded a three-year truce with the Ottoman Empire on 20November 1451, acknowledging the Wallachian boyars&#x27; right to elect the successor of VladislavII if he died.

Vlad allegedly wanted to settle in Brașov (which was a centre of the Wallachian boyars expelled by VladislausII), but Hunyadi forbade the burghers to give shelter to him on 6February 1452. Vlad returned to Moldavia where Alexăndrel had dethroned Peter Aaron. The events of his life during the years that followed are unknown. He must have returned to Hungary before 3July 1456 because, on that day, Hunyadi informed the townspeople of Brașov that he had tasked Vlad with the defence of the Transylvanian border.

=== Second rule ===

==== Consolidation ====
The circumstances and the date of Vlad&#x27;s return to Wallachia are uncertain. He invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support either in April, July or August 1456. VladislavII died during the invasion. Vlad sent his first extant letter as voivode of Wallachia to the burghers of Brașov on 10September. He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia. In the same letter, he stated that &quot;when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him&quot;, showing his authoritarian personality.

Multiple sources (including Laonikos Chalkokondyles&#x27;s chronicle) recorded that hundreds or thousands of people were executed at Vlad&#x27;s order at the beginning of his reign. He began a purge against the boyars who had participated in the murder of his father and elder brother or whom he suspected of plotting against him. Chalkokondyles stated that Vlad &quot;quickly effected a great change and utterly revolutionized the affairs of Wallachia&quot; through granting the &quot;money, property, and other goods&quot; of his victims to his retainers. The lists of the members of the princely council during Vlad&#x27;s reign also show that only two of them (Voico Dobrița and Iova) were able to retain their positions between 1457 and 1461.

==== Conflict with the Saxons ====
Vlad sent the customary tribute to the sultan. After John Hunyadi died on 11August 1456, his elder son, Ladislaus Hunyadi became the captain-general of Hungary. He accused Vlad of having &quot;no intention of remaining faithful&quot; to the king of Hungary in a letter to the burghers of Brașov, also ordering them to support VladislausII&#x27;s brother, DanIII, against Vlad. The burghers of Sibiu supported another pretender, a &quot;priest of the Romanians who calls himself a Prince&#x27;s son&quot;. The latter (identified as Vlad&#x27;s illegitimate brother, Vlad Călugărul) took possession of Amlaș, which had customarily been held by the rulers of Wallachia in Transylvania.

Ladislaus V of Hungary had Ladislaus Hunyadi executed on 16March 1457. Hunyadi&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Szilágyi, and her brother, Michael Szilágyi, stirred up a rebellion against the king. Taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Vlad assisted Stephen, son of BogdanII of Moldavia, in his move to seize Moldavia in June 1457. Vlad also broke into Transylvania and plundered the villages around Brașov and Sibiu. The earliest German stories about Vlad recounted that he had carried &quot;men, women, children&quot; from a Saxon village to Wallachia and had them impaled. Since the Transylvanian Saxons remained loyal to the king, Vlad&#x27;s attack against them strengthened the position of the Szilágyis.

Vlad&#x27;s representatives participated in the peace negotiations between Michael Szilágyi and the Saxons. According to their treaty, the burghers of Brașov agreed that they would expel Dan from their town. Vlad promised that the merchants of Sibiu could freely &quot;buy and sell&quot; goods in Wallachia in exchange for the &quot;same treatment&quot; of the Wallachian merchants in Transylvania. Vlad referred to Michael Szilágyi as &quot;his Lord and elder brother&quot; in a letter on 1December 1457.

Ladislaus Hunyadi&#x27;s younger brother, Matthias Corvinus, was elected king of Hungary on 24January 1458. He ordered the burghers of Sibiu to keep the peace with Vlad on 3March. Vlad styled himself &quot;Lord and ruler over all of Wallachia, and the duchies of Amlaș and Făgăraș&quot; on 20September 1459, showing that he had taken possession of both of these traditional Transylvanian fiefs of the rulers of Wallachia. Michael Szilágyi allowed the boyar Michael (an official of VladislavII of Wallachia) and other Wallachian boyars to settle in Transylvania in late March 1458. Before long, Vlad had the boyar Michael killed.

In May, Vlad asked the burghers of Brașov to send craftsmen to Wallachia, but his relationship with the Saxons deteriorated before the end of the year. According to a scholarly theory, the conflict emerged after Vlad forbade the Saxons to enter Wallachia, forcing them to sell their goods to Wallachian merchants at compulsory border fairs. Vlad&#x27;s protectionist tendencies or border fairs are not documented. Instead, in 1476, Vlad emphasized that he had always promoted free trade during his reign.

The Saxons confiscated the steel that a Wallachian merchant had bought in Brașov without repaying the price to him. In response, Vlad &quot;ransacked and tortured&quot; some Saxon merchants, according to a letter that Basarab Laiotă (a son of DanII of Wallachia) wrote on 21January 1459. Basarab had settled in Sighișoara and laid claim to Wallachia. However, Matthias Corvinus supported DanIII (who was again in Brașov) against Vlad. DanIII stated that Vlad had Saxon merchants and their children impaled or burnt alive in Wallachia.
 
Dan III broke into Wallachia, but Vlad defeated and executed him before 22April 1460. Vlad invaded southern Transylvania and destroyed the suburbs of Brașov, ordering the impalement of all men and women who had been captured. During the ensuing negotiations, Vlad demanded the expulsion or punishment of all Wallachian refugees from Brașov. Peace had been restored before 26July 1460, when Vlad addressed the burghers of Brașov as his &quot;brothers and friends&quot;. Vlad invaded the region around Amlaș and Făgăraș on 24August to punish the local inhabitants who had supported DanIII.

==== Ottoman war ====
Konstantin Mihailović (who served as a janissary in the sultan&#x27;s army) recorded that Vlad refused to pay homage to the sultan in an unspecified year. The Renaissance historian Giovanni Maria degli Angiolelli likewise wrote that Vlad had failed to pay tribute to the sultan for three years. Both records suggest that Vlad ignored the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, already in 1459, but both works were written decades after the events. Tursun Beg (a secretary in the sultan&#x27;s court) stated that Vlad only turned against the Ottoman Empire when the sultan &quot;was away on the long expedition in Trebizon&quot; in 1461. According to Tursun Beg, Vlad started new negotiations with Matthias Corvinus, but the sultan was soon informed by his spies. Mehmed sent his envoy, the Greek Thomas Katabolinos (also known as Yunus bey), to Wallachia, ordering Vlad to come to Constantinople. He also sent secret instructions to Hamza, bey of Nicopolis, to capture Vlad after he crossed the Danube. Vlad found out the sultan&#x27;s &quot;deceit and trickery&quot;, captured Hamza and Katabolinos, and had them executed.

After the execution of the Ottoman officials, Vlad gave orders in fluent Turkish to the commander of the fortress of Giurgiu to open the gates, enabling the Wallachian soldiers to break into the fortress and capture it. He invaded the Ottoman Empire, devastating the villages along the Danube. He informed Matthias Corvinus about the military action in a letter on 11February 1462. He stated that more than &quot;23,884 Turks and Bulgarians&quot; had been killed at his order during the campaign. He sought military assistance from Corvinus, declaring that he had broken the peace with the sultan &quot;for the honor&quot; of the king and the Holy Crown of Hungary and &quot;for the preservation of Christianity and the strengthening of the Catholic faith&quot;. The relationship between Moldavia and Wallachia had become tense by 1462, according to a letter of the Genoese governor of Kaffa.

Having learnt of Vlad&#x27;s invasion, Mehmed II raised an army of more than 150,000 strong that was said to be &quot;second in size only to the one&quot; that occupied Constantinople in 1453, according to Chalkokondyles. The size of the army suggests that the sultan wanted to occupy Wallachia, according to a number of historians (including Franz Babinger, Radu Florescu, and Nicolae Stoicescu). On the other hand, Mehmed had granted Wallachia to Vlad&#x27;s brother, Radu, before the invasion of Wallachia, showing that the sultan&#x27;s principal purpose was only the change of the ruler of Wallachia.

The Ottoman fleet landed at Brăila (which was the only Wallachian port on the Danube) in May. The main Ottoman army crossed the Danube under the command of the sultan at Nikopol, Bulgaria on 4June 1462. Outnumbered by the enemy, Vlad adopted a scorched earth policy and retreated towards Târgoviște. During the night of 1617 June, Vlad broke into the Ottoman camp in an attempt to capture or kill the sultan. Either the imprisonment or the death of the sultan would have caused panic among the Ottomans, which could have enabled Vlad to defeat the Ottoman army. However, the Wallachians &quot;missed the court of the sultan himself&quot; and attacked the tents of the &quot;viziers&quot; Mahmud Pasha and Isaac. Having failed to attack the sultan&#x27;s camp, Vlad and his retainers left the Ottoman camp at dawn. Mehmed entered Târgoviște at the end of June. The town had been deserted, but the Ottomans were horrified to discover a &quot;forest of the impaled&quot; (thousands of stakes with the carcasses of executed people), according to Chalkokondyles.

Tursun Beg recorded that the Ottomans suffered from the summer heat and thirst during the campaign. The sultan decided to retreat from Wallachia and marched towards Brăila. StephenIII of Moldavia hurried to Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine) to seize the important fortress where a Hungarian garrison had been placed. Vlad also departed for Chilia, but left behind a troop of 6,000 strong to try to hinder the march of the sultan&#x27;s army, but the Ottomans defeated the Wallachians. Stephen of Moldavia was wounded during the siege of Chilia and returned to Moldavia before Vlad came to the fortress.

The main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but Vlad&#x27;s brother Radu and his Ottoman troops stayed behind in the Bărăgan Plain. Radu sent messengers to the Wallachians, reminding them that the sultan could again invade their country. Although Vlad defeated Radu and his Ottoman allies in two battles during the following months, more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad withdrew to the Carpathian Mountains, hoping that Matthias Corvinus would help him regain his throne. However, Albert of Istenmező, the deputy of the Count of the Székelys, had recommended in mid-August that the Saxons recognize Radu. Radu also made an offer to the burghers of Brașov to confirm their commercial privileges and pay them a compensation of 15,000 ducats.

=== Imprisonment in Hungary ===
Matthias Corvinus came to Transylvania in November 1462. The negotiations between Corvinus and Vlad lasted for weeks, but Corvinus did not want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire. At the king&#x27;s order, his Czech mercenary commander, John Jiskra of Brandýs, captured Vlad near Rucăr in Wallachia.

To provide an explanation for Vlad&#x27;s imprisonment to Pope Pius II and the Venetians (who had sent money to finance a campaign against the Ottoman Empire), Corvinus presented three letters, allegedly written by Vlad on 7November 1462, to MehmedII, Mahmud Pasha, and Stephen of Moldavia. According to the letters, Vlad offered to join his forces with the sultan&#x27;s army against Hungary if the sultan restored him to his throne. Most historians agree that the documents were forged to give grounds for Vlad&#x27;s imprisonment. Corvinus&#x27;s court historian, Antonio Bonfini, admitted that the reason for Vlad&#x27;s imprisonment was never clarified. Florescu writes, &quot;[T]he style of writing, the rhetoric of meek submission (hardly compatible with what we know of Dracula&#x27;s character), clumsy wording, and poor Latin&quot; are all evidence that the letters could not be written on Vlad&#x27;s order. He associates the author of the forgery with a Saxon priest of Brașov.

Vlad was first imprisoned &quot;in the city of Belgrade&quot; (now Alba Iulia in Romania), according to Chalkokondyles. Before long, he was taken to Visegrád, where he was held for fourteen years. No documents referring to Vlad between 1462 and 1475 have been preserved. In the summer of 1475, StephenIII of Moldavia sent his envoys to Matthias Corvinus, asking him to send Vlad to Wallachia against Basarab Laiotă, who had submitted himself to the Ottomans. Stephen wanted to secure Wallachia for a ruler who had been an enemy of the Ottoman Empire, because &quot;the Wallachians [were] like the Turks&quot; to the Moldavians, according to his letter. According to the Slavic stories about Vlad, he was only released after he converted to Catholicism.

=== Third rule and death ===
Matthias Corvinus recognized Vlad as the lawful prince of Wallachia, but he did not provide him with military assistance to regain his principality. Vlad settled in a house in Pest. When a group of soldiers broke into the house while pursuing a thief who had tried to hide there, Vlad had their commander executed because they had not asked his permission before entering his home, according to the Slavic stories about his life. Vlad moved to Transylvania in June 1475. He wanted to settle in Sibiu and sent his envoy to the town in early June to arrange a house for him. MehmedII acknowledged Basarab Laiotă as the lawful ruler of Wallachia. Corvinus ordered the burghers of Sibiu to give 200 golden florins to Vlad from the royal revenues on 21September, but Vlad left Transylvania for Buda in October.

Vlad bought a house in Pécs that became known as &quot;Drakula háza&quot; (&quot;Dracula&#x27;s house&quot; in Hungarian). In January 1476 John Pongrác of Dengeleg, Voivode of Transylvania urged the people of Brașov to send to Vlad all those of his supporters who had settled in the town, because Corvinus and Basarab Laiotă had concluded a treaty. The relationship between the Transylvanian Saxons and Basarab remained tense, and the Saxons gave shelter to Basarab&#x27;s opponents during the following months. Corvinus dispatched Vlad and the Serbian Vuk Grgurević to fight against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. They captured Srebrenica and other fortresses in February and March 1476. In the Bosnian campaign, Vlad once again resorted to his terror tactics, mass impaling captured Turkish soldiers and massacring civilians in conquered settlements. His troops mostly destroyed Srebrenica, Kuslat, and Zvornik.

Mehmed II invaded Moldavia and defeated StephenIII in the Battle of Valea Albă on 26July 1476. Stephen Báthory and Vlad entered Moldavia, forcing the sultan to lift the siege of the fortress at Târgu Neamț in late August, according to a letter of Matthias Corvinus. The contemporaneous Jakob Unrest added that Vuk Grgurević and a member of the noble Jakšić family also participated in the struggle against the Ottomans in Moldavia.

Matthias Corvinus ordered the Transylvanian Saxons to support Báthory&#x27;s planned invasion of Wallachia on 6September 1476, also informing them that Stephen of Moldavia would also invade Wallachia. Vlad stayed in Brașov and confirmed the commercial privileges of the local burghers in Wallachia on 7October 1476. Báthory&#x27;s forces captured Târgoviște on 8November. Stephen of Moldavia and Vlad ceremoniously confirmed their alliance, and they occupied Bucharest, forcing Basarab Laiotă to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire on 16November. Vlad informed the merchants of Brașov about his victory, urging them to come to Wallachia. He was crowned before 26November.

Basarab Laiotă returned to Wallachia with Ottoman support, and Vlad died fighting against them in late December 1476 or early January 1477. In a letter written on 10January 1477, StephenIII of Moldavia related that Vlad&#x27;s Moldavian retinue had also been massacred. According to the &quot;most reliable sources&quot;, Vlad&#x27;s army of about 2,000 was cornered and destroyed by a Turkish-Basarab force of 4,000 near Snagov. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear. The Austrian chronicler Jacob Unrest stated that a disguised Turkish assassin murdered Vlad in his camp. In contrast, Russian statesman Fyodor Kuritsyn –who interviewed Vlad&#x27;s family after his demise– reported that the voivode was mistaken for a Turk by his own troops during battle, causing them to attack and kill him. Florescu and Raymond T. McNally commented this account by noting that Vlad had often disguised himself as a Turkish soldier as part of military ruses. According to Leonardo Botta, the Milanese ambassador to Buda, the Ottomans cut Vlad&#x27;s corpse into pieces. Bonfini wrote that Vlad&#x27;s head was sent to MehmedII; it was eventually placed on a high stake in Constantinople. His severed head allegedly was displayed and buried in Voivode Street (today Bankalar Caddesi) in Karaköy. It is rumoured that Voyvoda Han, located on Bankalar Caddesi No. 19, was the last stop of Vlad Tepeş&#x27;s skull. Local peasant traditions maintain that what was left of Vlad&#x27;s corpse was later discovered in the marshes of Snagov by monks from the nearby monastery.

The place of his burial is unknown. According to popular tradition (which was first recorded in the late 19th century), Vlad was buried in the Monastery of Snagov. However, the excavations carried out by Dinu V. Rosetti in 1933 found no tomb below the supposed &quot;unmarked tombstone&quot; of Vlad in the monastery church. Rosetti reported: &quot;Under the tombstone attributed to Vlad, there was no tomb. Only many bones and jaws of horses.&quot; Historian Constantin Rezachevici said Vlad was most probably buried in the first church of the Comana Monastery, which had been established by Vlad and was near the battlefield where he was killed.

== Family ==
Vlad had two wives, according to modern specialists. His first wife may have been an illegitimate daughter of John Hunyadi, according to historian Alexandru Simon. Vlad&#x27;s second wife was Justina Szilágyi, who was a cousin of Matthias Corvinus. She was the widow of Vencel Pongrác of Szentmiklós when &quot;Ladislaus Dragwlya&quot; married her, most probably in 1475. She survived Vlad Dracul, and married thirdly Pál Suki, then János Erdélyi.

Vlad&#x27;s eldest son, Mihnea, was born in 1462. Vlad&#x27;s unnamed second son was killed before 1486. Vlad&#x27;s third son, Vlad &quot;Drakwlya&quot;, unsuccessfully laid claim to Wallachia around 1495. He was the forefather of the noble Drakwla family.

== Legacy ==

=== Reputation for cruelty ===

==== First records ====
Stories about Vlad&#x27;s brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime. After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread. The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope PiusII in 1462. Two years later, the Pope included them in his &quot;Commentaries&quot;.

It was even rumored that Vlad once dipped his bread into the blood of his impaled victims, but this so far remains legendary, as the story has not been confirmed.

&quot;Meistersinger&quot; Michael Beheim wrote a lengthy poem about Vlad&#x27;s deeds, allegedly based on his conversation with a Catholic monk who had managed to escape from Vlad&#x27;s prison. The poem, called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Story of a Despot Called Dracula, Voievod of Wallachia&quot;), was performed at the court of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, in Wiener Neustadt during the winter of 1463. According to one of Beheim&#x27;s stories, Vlad had two monks impaled to assist them to go to heaven, also ordering the impalement of their donkey because it began braying after its masters&#x27; death. Beheim also accused Vlad of duplicity, stating that Vlad had promised support to both Matthias Corvinus and MehmedII but did not keep the promise.

In 1475, Gabriele Rangoni, Bishop of Eger (and a former papal legate), understood that Vlad had been imprisoned because of his cruelty. Rangoni also recorded the rumour that while in prison Vlad caught rats to cut them up into pieces or stuck them on small pieces of wood, because he was unable to &quot;forget his wickedness&quot;. Antonio Bonfini also recorded anecdotes about Vlad in his &quot;Historia Pannonica&quot; around 1495. Bonfini wanted to justify both the removal and the restoration of Vlad by Matthias. He described Vlad as &quot;a man of unheard cruelty and justice&quot;. Bonfini&#x27;s stories about Vlad were repeated in Sebastian Münster&#x27;s &quot;Cosmography&quot;. Münster also recorded Vlad&#x27;s &quot;reputation for tyrannical justice&quot;.

==== German stories ====
Works containing the stories about Vlad&#x27;s cruelty were published in Low German in the Holy Roman Empire before 1480. The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad&#x27;s campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to MehmedII&#x27;s invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year. They provide a detailed narration of the conflicts between Vlad and the Transylvanian Saxons, showing that they originated &quot;in the literary minds of the Saxons&quot;.

The stories about Vlad&#x27;s plundering raids in Transylvania were clearly based on an eyewitness account, because they contain accurate details (including the lists of the churches destroyed by Vlad and the dates of the raids). They describe Vlad as a &quot;demented psychopath, a sadist, a gruesome murderer, a masochist&quot;, worse than Caligula and Nero. However, the stories emphasizing Vlad&#x27;s cruelty are to be treated with caution because his brutal acts were very probably exaggerated (or even invented) by the Saxons.

The invention of movable type printing contributed to the popularity of the stories about Vlad, making them one of the first &quot;bestsellers&quot; in Europe. To enhance sales, they were published in books with woodcuts on their title pages that depicted horrific scenes. For instance, the editions published in Nuremberg in 1499 and in Strasbourg in 1500 depict Vlad dining at a table surrounded by dead or dying people on poles.

==== Slavic stories ====
There are more than 20 manuscripts (written between the 15th and 18th centuries) which preserved the text of the &quot;Skazanie o Drakule voievode&quot; (&quot;The Tale about Voivode Dracula&quot;). The manuscripts were written in Russian, but they copied a text that had originally been recorded in a South Slavic language, because they contain expressions alien to the Russian language but used in South Slavic idioms (such as &quot;diavol&quot; for &quot;evil&quot;). The original text was written in Buda between 1482 and 1486.

The nineteen anecdotes in the &quot;Skazanie&quot; are longer than the German stories about Vlad. They are a mixture of fact and fiction, according to historian Raymond T. McNally. Almost half of the anecdotes emphasize, like the German stories, Vlad&#x27;s brutality, but they also underline that his cruelty enabled him to strengthen the central government in Wallachia. For instance, the &quot;Skazanie&quot; writes of a golden cup that nobody dared to steal at a fountain because Vlad &quot;hated stealing so violently ... that anybody who caused any evil or robbery ... did not live long&quot;, thereby promoting public order, and the German story about Vlad&#x27;s campaign against Ottoman territory underlined his cruel acts while the &quot;Skazanie&quot; emphasized his successful diplomacy calling him &quot;zlomudry&quot; or &quot;evil-wise&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;Skazanie&quot; sharply criticized Vlad for his conversion to Catholicism, attributing his death to this apostasy. Some elements of the anecdotes were later added to Russian stories about Ivan the Terrible of Russia.

==== Assertion by modern standards ====
The mass murders that Vlad carried out indiscriminately and brutally would most likely amount to acts of genocide and war crimes by current standards. Romanian defense minister Ioan Mircea Pașcu asserted that Vlad would have been condemned for crimes against humanity had he been put on trial at Nuremberg.

Possible hemolacria

According to research published in 2023 based on the analysis of samples collected from letters written by Vlad, he may have had a rare condition known as haemolacria, which causes a person&#x27;s tears to be partially composed of blood.

National hero


The &quot;Cantacuzino Chronicle&quot; was the first Romanian historical work to record a tale about Vlad the Impaler, narrating the impalement of the old boyars of Târgoviște for the murder of his brother, Dan. The chronicle added that Vlad forced the young boyars and their wives and children to build the Poenari Castle. The legend of the Poenari Castle was mentioned in 1747 by NeofitI, Metropolitan of Ungro–Wallachia, who complemented it with the story of Meșterul Manole, who allegedly walled in his bride to prevent the crumbling of the walls of the castle during the building project. In the early 20th century, Constantin Rădulescu-Codin, a teacher in Muscel County where the castle was situated, published a local legend about Vlad&#x27;s letter of grant &quot;written on rabbit skin&quot; for the villagers who had helped him to escape from Poenari Castle to Transylvania during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia. In other villages of the region, the donation is attributed to the legendary Radu Negru.

Rădulescu-Codin recorded further local legends, some of which are also known from the German and Slavic stories about Vlad, suggesting that the latter stories preserved oral tradition. For instance, the tales about the burning of the lazy, the poor, and the lame at Vlad&#x27;s order and the execution of the woman who had made her husband too short a shirt can also be found among the German and Slavic anecdotes. The peasants telling the tales knew that Vlad&#x27;s sobriquet was connected to the frequent impalements during his reign, but they said only such cruel acts could secure public order in Wallachia.

Most Romanian artists have regarded Vlad as a just ruler and a realistic tyrant who punished criminals and executed unpatriotic boyars to strengthen the central government. Ion Budai-Deleanu wrote the first Romanian epic poem focusing on him. Deleanu&#x27;s &quot;Țiganiada&quot; (Gypsy Epic) (which was published only in 1875, almost a century after its composition) presented Vlad as a hero fighting against the boyars, Ottomans, &quot;strigoi&quot; (or vampires), and other evil spirits at the head of an army of gypsies and angels. The poet Dimitrie Bolintineanu emphasized Vlad&#x27;s triumphs in his &quot;Battles of the Romanians&quot; in the middle of the 19thcentury. He regarded Vlad as a reformer whose acts of violence were necessary to prevent the despotism of the boyars. One of the greatest Romanian poets, Mihai Eminescu, dedicated a historic ballad, &quot;The Third Letter&quot;, to the valiant princes of Wallachia, including Vlad. He urges Vlad to return from the grave and to annihilate the enemies of the Romanian nation:

In the early 1860s, the painter Theodor Aman depicted the meeting of Vlad and the Ottoman envoys, showing the envoys&#x27; fear of the Wallachian ruler.

Since the middle of the 19th century, Romanian historians have treated Vlad as one of the greatest Romanian rulers, emphasizing his fight for the independence of the Romanian lands. Even Vlad&#x27;s acts of cruelty were often represented as rational acts serving national interest. Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol was one of the first historians to emphasize that Vlad could only stop the internal fights of the boyar parties through his acts of terror. Constantin C. Giurescu remarked, &quot;The tortures and executions which [Vlad] ordered were not out of caprice, but always had a reason, and very often a reason of state&quot;. Ioan Bogdan was one of the few Romanian historians who did not accept this heroic image. In his work published in 1896, &quot;Vlad Țepeș and the German and Russian Narratives&quot;, he concluded that the Romanians should be ashamed of Vlad, instead of presenting him as &quot;a model of courage and patriotism&quot;. According to an opinion poll conducted in 1999, 4.1% of the participants chose Vlad the Impaler as one of &quot;the most important historical personalities who have influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better&quot;.

=== Vampire mythology ===

The stories about Vlad made him the best-known medieval ruler of the Romanian lands in Europe. However, Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, which was published in 1897, was the first book to make a connection between Dracula and vampirism. Stoker had his attention drawn to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore by Emily Gerard&#x27;s article about Transylvanian superstitions (published in 1885). His limited knowledge about the medieval history of Wallachia came from William Wilkinson&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them&quot;, published in 1820.
Stoker &quot;apparently did not know much about&quot; Vlad the Impaler, &quot;certainly not enough for us to say that Vlad was the inspiration for&quot; Count Dracula, according to Elizabeth Miller. For instance, Stoker wrote that Dracula had been of Székely origin only because he knew about both Attila the Hun&#x27;s destructive campaigns and the alleged Hunnic origin of the Székelys. Stoker&#x27;s main source, Wilkinson, who accepted the reliability of the German stories, described Vlad as a wicked man. Actually, Stoker&#x27;s working papers for his book contain no references to the historical figure, the name of the character being named in all drafts but the later ones &#x27;Count Wampyr&#x27;. Consequently, Stoker borrowed the name and &quot;scraps of miscellaneous information&quot; about the history of Wallachia when writing his book about Count Dracula.

== Appearance and representations ==
Pope Pius II&#x27;s legate, Niccolò Modrussa, painted the only extant description of Vlad, whom he had met in Buda. A copy of Vlad&#x27;s portrait has been featured in the &quot;monster portrait gallery&quot; in the Ambras Castle at Innsbruck. The picture depicts &quot;a strong, cruel, and somehow tortured man&quot; with &quot;large, deep-set, dark green, and penetrating eyes&quot;, according to Florescu. The colour of Vlad&#x27;s hair cannot be determined because Modrussa mentions that Vlad was black-haired, while the portrait seems to show that he had fair hair. The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip.

Vlad&#x27;s bad reputation in the German-speaking territories can be detected in a number of Renaissance paintings. He was portrayed among the witnesses of Saint Andrew&#x27;s martyrdom in a 15th-century painting, displayed in the Belvedere in Vienna. A figure similar to Vlad is one of the witnesses of Christ in the Calvary in a chapel of the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna.

<doc id="716869" wikidata="Q2114953" url="?curid=716869" title="President of East Germany">
<text>The president of the German Democratic Republic () was the head of state of the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany, from 1949 until 1960. The office was created by the Constitution of 1949 (). The president of the Republic was elected by the People&#x27;s Chamber (&quot;Volkskammer&quot;) and the Chamber of States (&quot;Länderkammer&quot;), the two chambers of parliament. The office was mostly ceremonial in nature. If necessary, the President of the Volkskammer acted as the president of the Republic.

The sole incumbent was Wilhelm Pieck of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), elected on 11 October 1949 and re-elected in 1953 and in 1957. Shortly after the death of Pieck on 7 September 1960, the Constitution was amended. The &quot;Law concerning the formation of the State Council&quot; of 12 September 1960 introduced a collective head of state instead of the presidency, the State Council of East Germany. In the last, pro-Western phase of East Germany in 1989/90, the State Council was abolished; President of the People&#x27;s Chamber Sabine Bergmann-Pohl acted as interim head of state.

== Election ==
The president of the Republic was elected for a term of four years by a joint session of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; and the &quot;Länderkammer&quot;, which was convened and presided over by the President of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;. Any citizen who was at least thirty-five years old was eligible for the post.

The administrative reform of 1952 led to the dissolution of the states (&quot;Länder&quot;) of East Germany. The &quot;Landerkammer&quot; thereby became meaningless; it met in 1954 for the last time and was formally abolished in 1958. As a result, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; alone was responsible for the election of the president.

== Oath of office ==
On assuming office, the president of the Republic took the following oath before a joint session of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; and the &quot;Landerkammer&quot;:

== Impeachment ==
The president of the Republic might be recalled before the expiration of his term by a joint resolution of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; and the &quot;Landerkammer&quot;. Such a resolution required a two-thirds majority of the statutory number of representatives.

== Duties and competences ==
Largely a ceremonial position (similarly to the president of West Germany), the duties and competences of the president of the Republic as stipulated in articles 104–108 of the Constitution of 1949:

* Promulgating the laws of the Republic.
* Receiving the oath of office from members of the Council of Ministers upon their assumption of duties.
* Representing the Republic in international relations.
* Concluding and signing treaties with foreign countries on behalf of the Republic.
* Accrediting and receiving ambassadors and ministers.

To become effective, all orders and decrees issued by the president of the Republic needed to be countersigned by the chairman of the Council of Ministers or the competent Minister.

The president exercised the right of pardon on behalf of the Republic. In this function he was advised by a committee of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;.

== Incapacitation and vacancy ==
Whenever the president of the Republic was unable to attend to his office, he was represented by the president of the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;. If such incapacity is expected to continue for a protracted period, a substitute was to be appointed by (a specific) law.

Whenever the presidency was terminated prematurely, the same rule applied until the election of a new president.

President Pieck was already 73 years old when he won his first term in 1949. Although he served as co-chairman of the SED alongside Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl from 1949 to 1950, he never played a major role in the party. Most of the power was held by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the party from 1950. This changed after the abolition of the presidential office, since the leader of the SED was usually also head of state.

== Abolition ==
After Wilhelm Pieck had died in 1960, the presidency was abolished in favor of a collective body, the State Council. The State Council was elected in the same way as the president, by the &quot;Volkskammer&quot;, and initially exercised the powers of the presidency. In reality, the State Council was effectively represented by its chairman, and it was reduced to a ceremonial body by 1974, with its chairman deriving real power from leadership of the SED.

With the Constitution of 1968, the last references to the presidency were eliminated.

After the Peaceful Revolution, there were plans to reintroduce the office of the president of the Republic by constitutional law from 1990 onward, which did not happen in the course of German reunification.

<doc id="716880" wikidata="Q1169274" url="?curid=716880" title="Battle of Cortenuova">
<text>The Battle of Cortenuova (sometimes spelled Cortenova) was fought on 27 November 1237 in the course of the Guelphs and Ghibellines Wars: in it, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II defeated the Second Lombard League.

==Background==
In 1235 Emperor Frederick was in Germany to quell the rebellion of his son Henry. In the autumn of that year he decided to return to Italy to suppress the Lombard communes which, backed by Pope Gregory IX, were contesting his authority. He arrived at Valeggio, near Verona, and, with the help of Ezzelino III da Romano and other Ghibelline leaders, sacked the city of Vicenza. Satisfied with this first outcome, he came back to Germany to deal with another German princes&#x27; rebellion, leaving Hermann von Salza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, in Italy to monitor the situation.

In August 1237 the emperor returned again to Italy, this time aiming to definitively crush the Second Lombard League. He crossed the Alps to Verona and here his 2,000 knights were joined by Ezzelino III da Romano&#x27;s troops, including soldiers from Treviso, Padua, Vicenza, and Verona itself, as well as by Tuscan men led by Gaboard of Arnstein. Later 6,000 infantry and horsemen from the Kingdom of Sicily came, including Apulian Muslim archers. The rest of the army was formed by Ghibellines from Cremona, Pavia, Modena, Parma, and Reggio, for a total of 12,000 – 15,000 men

The imperial army marched first against Mantua, which decided to surrender instead of being sacked, and then to Bergamo, whose council of nobles took the same decision in exchange for no formal submission. Frederick then invaded Brescia&#x27;s territory, capturing Goito and Montichiari among the others, although the latter&#x27;s resistance gave time for most of the Lombard League troops to reach Brescia. The 2,000-knights and 6,000-infantry strong army, led by Pietro Tiepolo, &quot;podestà &quot;of Milan and son of the doge of Venice, occupied a favorable position at Manerbio (November 1237). The two armies remained fifteen days facing each other without battling, separated by a marsh that thwarted the knights&#x27; effectiveness. Frederick, whose army was becoming short of supply, left his camp in search of a more advantageous position, and on 24 November 1237 crossed the Oglio River near Pontevico, where the Lombardian League&#x27;s army was camped, marching northwards to wait for the enemy&#x27;s moves at Soncino.

==Battle==
The Lombards believed the rumors, skilfully spread by the emperor, that he was withdrawing to Cremona to spend the winter there. Therefore, they also started towards their winter quarters. However, Frederick had posted a contingent from Bergamo at Cividate al Piano, which would inform him of the Lombard movements through smoke signals. When the Lombard army had completed its crossing of Oglio at Pontoglio and Palazzolo, the imperial troops saw large clouds of smoke and moved to Cortenuova, which was 18 km from their current positions.

The imperial vanguard included Saracens and horsemen, which were the first units to attack the withdrawing Lombards, followed by the infantry. Taken by surprise, the Milanese and Piacentines were unable to form a defense line, and fled to Cortenuova. When Frederick and his main force reached the battlefield, it was scattered with knights, slain or wounded and his passage blocked by riderless horses. At Cortenuova, other Milanese and troops from Alessandria rallied around their Carroccio, where the Lombards fought valiantly under the Saracen arrows and the Teutonic charges. A column of men from Milanese noble families, despite the arrival of other Bergamo troops, was able to protect the rest of the army&#x27;s retreat to Cortenuova till nightfall. To keep the army&#x27;s morale as high as possible, Frederick ordered his troop to sleep with their armor on, and to attack at the first light of dawn. On the other side, the &quot;podestà&quot; of Milan, recognizing that the troops could not withstand another battle, ordered the abandonment of the town along with the Carroccio and the rest of the baggage.

On the dawn of 28 November the Imperials attacked the hastily-retreating Lombards, who collapsed with minimal resistance. Many drowned in the Oglio, which was overflowing due to a flood. About 4,000 Lombards were captured, and the wounded and killed numbered several thousand. The Milanese alone lost 2,500 soldiers. 

Of the battlefield, Pietro della Vigna recorded: 

==Aftermath==
The Lombard League&#x27;s army was virtually annihilated. Frederick made a triumphal entrance in the allied city of Cremona, with the Carroccio towed by an elephant and Tiepolo chained on it. The latter was first detained in Apulia and then publicly executed in Trani. The Carroccio was later sent to Rome as a show of the imperial power.

The Lombard League disbanded. Lodi, Novara, Vercelli, Chieri, and Savona were captured or submitted to the emperor, while Amadeus IV of Savoy and Boniface II of Montferrat confirmed their Ghibelline allegiance. Milan, Brescia, Piacenza, and Bologna remained alone in arms. Frederick, now at the top of his strength, besieged Milan. He rejected all Milanese peace overtures, insisting on unconditional surrender. Milan and five other cities, however, held out, and, in October 1238, he had to raise the siege of Brescia.

The emperor then went on to invade the Papal States, and was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX.

<text>Snowy Mountains Highway is a state highway located in New South Wales, Australia. Its two sections connect the New South Wales South Coast to the Monaro region, and the Monaro to the South Western Slopes via the Snowy Mountains. The higher altitude regions of this road are subject to snow over the winter months, and the road also provides access to many parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The highway bears the B72 shield along its entire length.

The highway originally bore the name Monaro Highway until 1955, when it received its current name. It originally ran from to Wagga Wagga but has been shortened to run from Princes Highway to Hume Highway instead. Reservoirs created as a result of dams built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme required the creation of major realignments to avoid submerged areas. Previous to New South Wales&#x27; conversion to alphanumeric route markers, it was signed as National Route 18.

==Route description==

Snowy Mountains Highway begins at a T-intersection with Princes Highway at Stony Creek, north of . It heads roughly west through hilly terrain, the terrain smooths eventually and the road crosses the Bemboka River at Morans Crossing. A short distance further the road passes through Bemboka, taking on the name Loftus Street within the urban area. West of Bemboka the road follows the southern bank of the Bemboka River, before crossing the Nunnock River near its confluence with the Bemboka River at the base of the Great Dividing Range escarpment. Up until this point the immediate landscape surrounding the road has so far consisted of farmland. From the base of the range the road enters South East Forest National Park and follows a steep and winding alignment up the range from about above sea level, to over . At the top of the range the road then enters Glenbog State Forest before once again traversing farmland for a short distance until it meets the Monaro Highway at Steeple Flat, south of Nimmitabel. This intersection is a T-intersection, through traffic continues north along Monaro Highway, while traffic heading to the south from either direction must turn. To reach the western section of Snowy Mountains Highway, Monaro Highway must be taken north towards Cooma at this point.

The western section begins at the Bombala and Sharp Street roundabout in Cooma. The highway takes on the name Sharp Street from this intersection as it heads west within Cooma urban area. Upon leaving Cooma, the road heads west via farmland to the village of . Here the road meets a T-intersection, with through traffic taking Kosciuszko Road southwest towards Jindabyne. The highway turns to continue on its westerly heading. The roadway then makes its way through undulating terrain for some distance before it passes through Adaminaby, and on into Kosciuszko National Park. The park boundary is marked by a sign, there are no park entry gates on the highway, and park entry fees are not payable. The road winds through mountainous terrain as it climbs towards the abandoned mining settlement of Kiandra, situated at an altitude of around . The landscape becomes open grassland at this point and remains relatively flat as the road continues relatively gently up an alpine valley created by the Eucumbene River and its numerous tributaries. At the top of the valley the road reaches its highest point a little below . The road then descends into part of a similar valley created by the Murrumbidgee River as it passes by the access roads for Yarrangobilly Caves. The highway then veers northwest back into forested terrain and continues along the same rough heading through hilly terrain for some distance before a mountainous descent from , near the town of Talbingo which is located a few kilometres west of the highway. Continuing on, the roadway passes by Jounama Dam and then roughly parallels the eastern side of Blowering Reservoir (created by Blowering Dam further downstream). It then leaves the National Park descending into farmland on the Tumut Plains, roughly above sea level.

From here the highway then crosses the Tumut River and heads into the town of Tumut itself, taking on the names Blowering Street, Fitzroy Street, and Adelong Street within the urban area. West of Tumut the road crosses a large valley created by Gilmore Creek and Deep Creek, before a small climb through Adelong Gap into the town of Adelong, taking on the names Tumut Street, Inglis Street, and Lynch Street within the urban area. Beyond Adelong, the road continues northeast through undulating terrain before crossing Hillas Creek and then following it for the last few kilometres until the highway&#x27;s western terminus at Hume Highway, located roughly halfway between Gundagai and Tarcutta.

High altitude sections subject to snow and ice have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes double or triple height); in contrast to the white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.

==History==

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Monaro Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 4) on 8 August 1928, heading northwest from Tathra, via Bega, Nimmitabel, Cooma, Adaminaby, Tumut, Adelong, and Lower Tarcutta to Wagga Wagga. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 4 on 8 April 1929.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year, proclaimed the portion of the highway between Wagga Wagga and Hume Highway at Lower Tarcutta to be part of Sturt Highway on 8 August 1933; the highway&#x27;s western end was truncated at its own junction with Hume Highway near Hillas Creek instead.

When the Snowy Mountains Scheme commenced in 1949, the road began to increase in importance. Roadworks to increase the standard of the road were undertaken, and were often paid for by the Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric Authority. In 1955, it was decided that what was still then known as Monaro Highway would be renamed as Snowy Mountains Highway. This was done as only a relatively small portion of the road was actually within the Monaro region. The section of road between Cooma and Nimmitabel was also reclassified as part of State Highway 19, which at that time ran from Canberra, to the Victorian border west of . The various roads classified as State Highway 19, were then named as Monaro Highway in 1958. In contrast with Snowy Mountains Highway, the entire length of that highway is within the Monaro region.

Over the years further changes to the alignment have occurred. The eastern section of the highway no longer runs west to Nimmitabel, instead meeting Monaro Highway to the south; the old section has been renamed as Old Bega Road. The western section has also seen some major changes with the highway being realigned to avoid Lake Eucumbene near Adaminaby due to the construction of Eucumbene Dam in the 1950s. Similarly realignment was required to avoid the Jounama Pondage and Blowering Reservoir near due to the construction of Jounama and Blowering Dams in the 1960s.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the eastern end of the highway was truncated to the intersection with Princes Highway at Stony Creek north of Bega on 24 May 1996; the former section from Bega to Tathra was renamed as Tathra Road. Snowy Mountains Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 4, from the intersection with Princes Highway at Stony Creek to the intersection with Monaro Highway south of Nimmitabel, and from Cooma to the intersection with Hume Highway near Hillas Creek in Mount Adrah.

===Route markers===

Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme, with the highway allocated National Route 18 across its entire length in 1955. In addition to this, the section of Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed as National Route 18 in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B72. The concurrency along Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.

<doc id="716886" wikidata="Q4037498" url="?curid=716886" title="Dom &amp; Roland">
<text>Dominic Angas, better known by his stage name Dom &amp; Roland, is a British drum and bass DJ and record producer. Active since the mid-1990s, Angas is recognised for his contributions to the techstep subgenre and his work with labels such as Moving Shadow, Metalheadz, and his own imprint, Dom &amp; Roland Productions. His debut album, &quot;Industry&quot; (1998), is regarded as a significant release in the late 1990s drum and bass scene. In addition to his solo work, Angas has contributed to the development of the darker, experimental edge of drum and bass through numerous collaborations and remixes. 

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Dominic Angas grew up in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. He spent five years in Germany during his childhood before returning to England, where he developed an interest in hip-hop during his teenage years. Angas transitioned to breakbeat music in his twenties and began exploring drum and bass production, following a friendship with Ed Rush.

=== Early career (1995–1996) ===
Angas&#x27; entry into the drum and bass scene began with No U-Turn&#x27;s Nico Sykes, whom he persistently approached for studio time. After Sykes agreed, Angas collaborated with Brian Ferrier under the name Current Affairs, releasing their debut single, &quot;East/Solstice&quot; (1995), on Sykes&#x27; Saigon imprint. Their next release, &quot;Cutting Edge/Turbulence&quot; (1996), appeared on Moving Shadow and featured heavy drum breaks and basslines characteristic of the emerging techstep style. To further his skills, Angas took classes in studio engineering and production while working as a restaurant manager to support himself.

=== Dom &amp; Roland (1996–1997) ===
Adopting the alias Dom &amp; Roland, a reference to himself and his Roland sampler, Angas released &quot;Dynamics/The Planets&quot; in early 1996. That same year, he signed a non-exclusive contract with Moving Shadow and released tracks such as &quot;The Storm/Sonic Shock&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Something Else/Interstellar Jazz&quot; (1996). By the end of the year, Angas had released four singles and contributed to compilation tracks and remixes, including Flytronix&#x27;s work and the Art of Noise&#x27;s drum and bass remix album.

In 1997, Moving Shadow founder Rob Playford enlisted Angas for the label&#x27;s 100th release, resulting in the track &quot;Distorted Dreams&quot;, a collaboration with Playford. Other releases from this period include &quot;Resistance/Hydrolics&quot;(1997) and &quot;The Drones&quot; under the Current Affairs alias. Angas also collaborated with Ed Rush as Neotech on &quot;Valves/Terminal&quot; and with Optical on &quot;Quadrant 6/Concrete Shoes&quot;. These tracks expanded his exploration of techstep, though some critics noted a reliance on familiar production techniques within the subgenre.

=== Debut (1998–2004) ===
Dom &amp; Roland released his debut album, &quot;Industry&quot;, in 1998 on Moving Shadow. The album incorporated collaborations with Optical and reflected the darker, technical sound of the late 1990s drum and bass scene. Reviews were mixed, with some highlighting its innovative approach while others critiqued its alignment with established techstep elements.

Angas&#x27; subsequent albums, &quot;Back for the Future&quot; (2002) and &quot;Chronology&quot; (2004), were also released on Moving Shadow. &quot;Chronology&quot; featured collaborations with artists such as Konflict, Skynet, and Hive and marked the end of his association with the label.

=== 2004–present: Dom &amp; Roland Productions and later work ===
After leaving Moving Shadow, Angas founded his own label, Dom &amp; Roland Productions (DRP). His fourth album, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; (2008), included both new material and previously released tracks from DRP. He followed this with &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; (2009), which featured collaborations with Noisia, Amon Tobin, and Rob Playford, and &quot;The Big Bang&quot; (2011).

In the mid-2010s, Angas joined Metalheadz, a label founded by Goldie, and continues releasing music under the Metalheadz imprint.

The western part of the municipal territory lies in the Lower Morava Valley and the eastern part in the Vizovice Highlands. The highest point is at above sea level.

The town is situated on the left bank of the Morava River, which forms the northern border of the municipal territory. The Olšava River flows through the southern part of the territory.

==History==

A predecessor of Uherské Hradiště was a settlement and fortification system on three island in the Morava River, founded by Slavic tribes in the early 9th century. The settlement disappeared after the fall of the Great Moravian Empire.

The town of was founded in 1257 by King Ottokar II to protect the nearby monastery in Velehrad. It was originally named &quot;Nový Velehrad&quot; (&quot;New Velehrad&quot;) and then Hradiště. In 1587, the name Uherské Hradiště was used for the first time.

In the 14th century, stone walls were built and replaced the original wooden palisades. In the following centuries, the fortification system has been continuously improved. Due to its location, Uherské Hradiště repeatedly faced raids. The town was threatened by the Cumans in the 16th century, by military clashes during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, or by Turkish invasions during the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718). The town was not conquered until 1742 by the Prussian Army.

From 1644 to 1773, the Jesuits acted in the town. Their work increased the cultural and spiritual life of the town. The order founded complex of buildings which included Jesuit college, Church of Saint Francis Xavier and Jesuit school.

In the 1780s, Uherské Hradiště ceased to function as a fortress. In the mid-19th century, the town began to expand beyond the walls. Construction growth continued in the late 19th century when representative building were constructed, and in the early 20th century when industrial companies were founded.

Uherské Hradiště was hit by the 1997 Central European flood.

<text>An inclined plane is a type of cable railway used on some canals for raising boats between different water levels. Boats may be conveyed afloat, in caissons, or may be carried in cradles or slings.

==History==
Inclined planes have evolved over the centuries. Some of the first were used by the Egyptians to bypass waterfalls on the Nile. These consisted of wooden slides covered with silt which reduced friction.

===Timeline===
*600BC – The Diolkos, an early Greek inclined plane, was in use.
*385AD – Inclined planes were in use on the Grand Canal in China.
*1167 – Nieuwedamme &quot;overtoom&quot; (a simple type of incline) was built at Ypres.
*1568 – Wagon of Zafosina in use near Venice.
*1777 – 3 inclined planes or &#x27;dry wherries&#x27; began operation on Dukart&#x27;s Canal, near Coalisland, in the south-east of County Tyrone in Ulster. 
*1788 – An inclined plane was built by William Reynolds and used, for the first time in England, to raise canal boats on England&#x27;s Ketley Canal.
*1792 – William Reynolds of Ketley Ironworks constructed several inclined planes on the Shropshire Canal.
*1792–1921 – In 1792 the Shropshire Tub Canals were built incorporating a number of inclined planes. One of these, the Trench plane closed in 1921 and brought to an end boat-carrying inclined planes in Britain
*1797–1822 – At Worsley Navigable Levels, a coal mine operation in Greater Manchester, England, an underground incline started in 1795 was completed in 1797.
*1800 – Francis Henry Egerton (1756-1829), who became The 8th Earl of Bridgewater in 1823, wrote &#x27;The Description of the Inclined Plane at Walkden Moor. (Lancashire)
*1806–1828 Two inclined planes built on the Stollen Canal at Gliwice, Upper Silesia.

*1831–1924 – Between 1825 and 1831, 23 inclines were built as part of the Morris Canal, New Jersey, USA. This waterway, long, connected the Hudson and Delaware Rivers, rising more than . In 1832, Frances Trollope, publishes in &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot; her account of a visit the previous year to see one of the inclined planes of the Morris Canal. In 1924 the canal was abandoned and later dismantled. The Morris Canal&#x27;s design was reused for the planes on the Elbląg Canal. (see below) 
*1837–1865 – The extension to the Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal, Wales opened in 1837, including two counterbalanced inclined planes and one single-track one. 
*1849–1942 – Inclined plane built on the Monkland Canal near Blackhill, Scotland to supplement existing locks.
*1860–present – The first four inclined planes of the Elbląg Canal in Germany (East Prussia), nowadays Poland, were opened in 1860. A fifth incline was added later to replace five wooden locks. This canal reused the design from the Morris Canal for its inclined planes. 

*1900–1926 – Foxton Inclined Plane was built in England to help overcome shortcomings of the Foxton locks on the Grand Union Canal. Mothballed in 1911 and seeing only occasional use and dismantled in 1926.
*1969–present – In 1969 the Saint-Louis-Arzviller inclined plane replaced a ladder of seventeen locks over a distance of four kilometers on the Marne–Rhine Canal in France.

==Other examples==
===With caissons===
The electric inclined plane at the Krasnoyarsk Dam in Divnogorsk, Russia The ship capacity is up to 1500 tons, maximum ship size is and elevation is . This is an electric rack railway. The track gauge of the railway is , making it the widest gauge railway of any type in the world.

===Without caissons===
* Morris Canal, Northern New Jersey

<text>Scenic World is a family-owned tourist attraction located in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales, Australia, about 100 kilometres west of Sydney. Scenic World is home to four attractions, the Scenic Railway, the Scenic Skyway, the Scenic Cableway and Scenic Walkway, a 2.4-km elevated boardwalk through ancient rainforest.

==Overview==
===Railway===
The Scenic Railway is an incline railway now used for tourism. The steepest section of track is on an incline of 52 degrees (128% gradient) contained within a total distance of . It was originally constructed for a coal and oil shale mining operation in the Jamison Valley in the 1880s, in order to haul the coal and shale from the valley floor up to the escarpment above. From 1928 to 1945, it carried coal during the week and passengers at weekends. The coal mine was closed in 1945 after which it remained as a tourist attraction. The Scenic Railway was temporarily closed on 13 January 2013 (although the Skyway, Cableway, and Walkway remained open) as construction to upgrade both tracks and carriages began. The work was completed and the railway reopened in April 2013. 

The Scenic Railway has been promoted as the world&#x27;s steepest passenger railway, but it is technically an inclined lift, not a funicular, due to its winch system and lack of a counterbalancing carriage. Among true funiculars, the Stoosbahn in Switzerland, opened in 2017, holds the record for steepest incline. In the broader category of cable cars, the Scenic Railway was surpassed in steepness in 2024 by the new Schilthorn cable car in Switzerland, which has a gradient of 159.4%.

=== Skyway ===
Built in 1958, the Scenic Skyway is another cable-driven conveyance at Scenic World. It travels across the gorge above the Katoomba Falls, above the valley floor. The original Scenic Skyway was withdrawn on 4 April 2004 after 587,401 crossings and now sits in the picnic area at Scenic World. It was replaced by a new cabin in December of the same year. The new Skyway was built by Doppelmayr and CWA Constructions, and features a 72-person cabin with sections of liquid crystal glass that turns a raised section of the floor transparent as the ride progresses. In November 2005, a second station on the opposite cliff-face opened, allowing Skyway passengers to disembark and follow bush walking trails to the nearby Echo Point.
In November 2017, the latest Scenic Skyway cabin was launched. This Skyway cabin is 30% bigger than its predecessor, offering visitors a more spacious ride with easier boarding, as well as free Wi-Fi.

===Cableway===
In 2000, Scenic World installed the Sceniscender, now called Scenic Cableway, 84-passenger cable car from Doppelmayr that passes over a tower on the edge of the cliff, and then to the Botton Station in the Jamison Valley below.

Like the redevelopment of the Railway and Skyway, the Cableway had a replacement of its cabin in 2018.

=== Dining ===
Scenic World operates two food and beverage outlets, namely EATS270 and the Terrace Café.

The former Scenic Revolving Restaurant was renovated and reopened in late 2012 as an eatery. During this time, a decision was made to cease operation of the revolving floor. The floor can still, however, be turned on by request for private functions. Both EATS270 and the Terrace Café feature balcony areas with extensive outdoor seating overlooking the Three Sisters and Jamison Valley.

Scenic World food and beverage outlets are not open in the evenings for general dining, but can be booked for private functions and corporate events.

=== Orphan Rocker ===
In 1984, Scenic World began building a roller coaster known as the Orphan Rocker, named after the nearby Orphan Rock. It was the first roller coaster to be completely designed and manufactured in Australia. The highlight of this ride is meant to be a swooping banked turn that takes riders within metres of the edge of a cliff. It has in the past been referred to as a &quot;sitdown suspended&quot; coaster, because although it is a conventional sitdown coaster, the trains can tilt from side to side, like a suspended coaster, giving it its name. It was originally planned as a scenic monorail ride, but it soon evolved into a roller-coaster ride. The roller coaster has never publicly opened due to demands for redevelopment elsewhere onsite. Visitation to Scenic World in the 1980s was increasing rapidly, mostly due to increased numbers of Japanese visitors, necessitating additional access into the valley and the idea for Scenic World&#x27;s third ride, The Cableway (originally Scenicscender), was born.

In 1999, Phillip Hammon cited ‘safety issues’ as the reason for what was by then a 15-year delay. As late as 2006, Scenic World’s team remained adamant that the Orphan Rocker would open.

Portions of the coaster&#x27;s track have been removed as of 2017. The roller coaster was never opened to the public.

<text>A virtual world (also called a virtual space or spaces) is a computer-simulated environment which may be populated by many simultaneous users who can create a personal avatar and independently explore the virtual world, participate in its activities, and communicate with others. These avatars can be textual, graphical representations, or live video avatars with auditory and touch sensations. Virtual worlds are closely related to mirror worlds.

In a virtual world, the user accesses a computer-simulated world which presents perceptual stimuli to the user, who in turn can manipulate elements of the modeled world and thus experience a degree of presence.
Such modeled worlds and their rules may draw from reality or fantasy worlds. Example rules are gravity, topography, locomotion, real-time actions, and communication. Communication between users can range from text, graphical icons, visual gesture, sound, and rarely, forms using touch, voice command, and balance senses.

Massively multiplayer online games depict a wide range of worlds, including those based on the real world, science fiction, super heroes, sports, horror, and historical milieus. Most MMORPGs have real-time actions and communication. Players create a character who travels between buildings, towns, and worlds to carry out business or leisure activities. Communication is usually textual, but real-time voice communication is also possible. The form of communication used can substantially affect the experience of players in the game. Media studies professor Edward Castronova used the term &quot;synthetic worlds&quot; to discuss individual virtual worlds, but this term has not been widely adopted.

Virtual worlds are not limited to games but, depending on the degree of immediacy presented, can encompass computer conferencing and text-based chatrooms.

==History==
The concept of virtual worlds significantly predates computers. The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, expressed an interest in perceptual illusion. In the twentieth century, the cinematographer Morton Heilig explored the creation of the Sensorama, a theatre experience designed to stimulate the senses of the audience—vision, sound, balance, smell, even touch (via wind)—and so draw them more effectively into the productions.

Among the earliest virtual worlds implemented by computers were virtual reality simulators, such as the work of Ivan Sutherland. Such devices are characterized by bulky headsets and other types of sensory input simulation. Contemporary virtual worlds, in particular the multi-user online environments, emerged mostly independently of this research, fueled instead by the gaming industry but drawing on similar inspiration. While classic sensory-imitating virtual reality relies on tricking the perceptual system into experiencing an immersive environment, virtual worlds typically rely on mentally and emotionally engaging content which gives rise to an immersive experience.

Maze War was the first networked, 3D multi-user first person shooter game. Maze introduced the concept of online players in 1973–1974 as &quot;eyeball &#x27;avatars&#x27; chasing each other around in a maze.&quot; It was played on ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, a precursor to the Internet funded by the United States Department of Defense for use in university and research laboratories. The initial game could only be played on an Imlac, as it was specifically designed for this type of computer.

The first virtual worlds presented on the Internet were communities and chat rooms, some of which evolved into MUDs and MUSHes. The first MUD, known as MUD1, was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain. A MUD is a virtual world with many players interacting in real time. The early versions were text-based, offering only limited graphical representation and often using a command-line interface. Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players. Such early worlds began the MUD heritage that eventually led to massively multiplayer online role-playing games, more commonly known as MMORPGs, a genre of role-playing games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world.

Some prototype virtual worlds were &quot;WorldsAway&quot;, a two-dimensional chat environment where users designed their own avatars; &quot;Dreamscape,&quot; an interactive community featuring a virtual world by CompuServe; Cityspace, an educational networking and 3D computer graphics project for children; and &quot;The Palace&quot;, a 2-dimensional community driven virtual world. However, credit for the first online virtual world usually goes to &quot;Habitat&quot;, developed in 1987 by LucasFilm Games for the Commodore 64 computer, and running on the Quantum Link service (the precursor to America Online).

In 1996, the city of Helsinki, Finland with Helsinki Telephone Company (since Elisa Group) launched what was called the first online virtual 3D depiction intended to map an entire city. The Virtual Helsinki project was eventually renamed Helsinki Arena 2000 project and parts of the city in modern and historical context were rendered in 3D.

In 1999, Whyville.net the first virtual world specifically for children was launched with a base in game-based learning and one of the earliest virtual currency-based economies. Shortly after, in 2000, Habbo launched and grew to become one of the most popular and longest running virtual worlds with millions of users around the world.

==Virtual world concepts==
Definitions for a &quot;virtual world&quot; include:
* &quot;&quot;A virtual world is something with the following characteristics: It operates using an underlying automated rule set—its physics; Each player represents an individual &quot;in&quot; the virtual world-that player’s character; Interaction with the world takes place in real time—if you do something, it happens pretty much when you do it; The world is shared-other people can play in the same world at the same time as you; The world is persistent-it’s still there when you’re not; It’s not the real world&quot;&quot;, by Richard Bartle in 2015
* &quot;A simulated environment where many agents can virtually interact with each other, act and react to things, phenomena and the environment; agents can be zero or many human(s), each represented by many entities called a virtual self (an avatar), or many software agents; all action/reaction/interaction must happen in a real-time shared spatiotemporal nonpausable virtual environment; the environment may consist of many data spaces, but the collection of data spaces should constitute a shared data space, one persistent shard&quot;, by Nevelsteen in 2018

There is no generally accepted definition of virtual world, but they do require that the world be persistent; in other words, the world must continue to exist even after a user exits the world, and user-made changes to the world should be preserved. 
While the interaction with other participants is done in real-time, time consistency is not always maintained in online virtual worlds. For example, &quot;EverQuest&quot; time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.

As &quot;virtual world&quot; is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include
* Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games, meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; &quot;Destiny&quot; is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the Google Maps API or through a simple virtual geocaching of &quot;easter eggs&quot; on WikiMapia or similar mash-ups, where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of mixed reality.
* Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment.
* Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds, where the user can edit and alter their avatar at will, allowing them to play a more dynamic role, or multiple roles.

===Economy===

A virtual economy is the emergent property of the interaction between participants in a virtual world. While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency. Participants have a limited time in the virtual world, as in the real world, which they must divide between task such as collecting resources, practicing trade skills, or engaging in less productive fun play. The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of Second Life, however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world. In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in &quot;Diablo II&quot;.

The value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them. The investment of real world resources (time, membership fees, etc.) in acquisition of wealth in a virtual economy may contribute to the real world value of virtual objects. This real world value is made obvious by the (mostly illegal) trade of virtual items on online market sites like eBay, PlayerUp, IGE for real world money. Recent legal disputes also acknowledge the value of virtual property, even overriding the mandatory EULA which many software companies use to establish that virtual property has no value and/or that users of the virtual world have no legal claim to property therein.

Some industry analysts have moreover observed that there is a secondary industry growing behind the virtual worlds, made up by social networks, websites and other projects completely devoted to virtual worlds communities and gamers. Special websites such as GamerDNA, Koinup and others which serve as social networks for virtual worlds users are facing some crucial issues as the DataPortability of avatars across many virtual worlds and MMORPGs.

Virtual worlds offer advertisers the potential for virtual advertisements, such as the in-game advertising already found in a number of video games.

===Geography===
The geography of virtual worlds can vary widely because the role of geography and space is an important design component over which the developers of virtual worlds have control and may choose to alter. Virtual worlds are, at least superficially, digital instantiations of three-dimensional space. As a result, considerations of geography in virtual worlds (such as World of Warcraft) often revolve around “spatial narratives” in which players act out a nomadic hero&#x27;s journey along the lines of that present in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The creation of fantastic places is also a reoccurring theme in the geographic study of virtual worlds, although, perhaps counterintuitively, the heaviest users of virtual worlds often downgrade the sensory stimuli of the world&#x27;s fantastic places in order to make themselves more efficient at core tasks in the world, such as killing monsters. However, the geographic component of some worlds may only be a geographic veneer atop an otherwise nonspatial core structure. For instance, while imposing geographic constraints upon users when they quest for items, these constraints may be removed when they sell items in a geographically unconstrained auction house. In this way, virtual worlds may provide a glimpse into what the future economic geography of the physical world may be like as more and more goods become digital.

===Research===
Virtual spaces can serve a variety of research and educational goals and may be useful for examining human behaviour. Offline- and virtual-world personalities differ from each other but are nevertheless significantly related which has a number of implications for self-verification, self-enhancement and other personality theories. Panic and agoraphobia have also been studied in a virtual world.

Given the large engagement, especially of young children in virtual worlds, there has been a steady growth in research studies involving the social, educational and even emotional impact of virtual worlds on children. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for example have funded research into virtual worlds including, for example, how preteens explore and share information about reproductive health. A larger set of studies on children&#x27;s social and political use of the virtual world Whyville.net has also been published in the book &quot;Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World&quot; Authored by Yasmin B. Kafai, Deborah A. Fields, and Mizuko Ito. Several other research publications now specifically address the use of virtual worlds for education.

Other research focused more on adults explores the reasons for indulging and the emotions of virtual world users. Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life. However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives. The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it. The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace. Instead, it has become the individual&#x27;s bridge between the physical and virtual world, a conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors. The avatar becomes the person&#x27;s alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.

While greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to “live person” relationships (Toronto, 2009). When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009). Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they do not ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009). Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape.

Another area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael&#x27;s College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments. An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups&#x27; performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.

==Hardware==
Unlike most video games, which are usually navigated using various free-ranging human interface devices (HIDs), virtual worlds are usually navigated (as of 2009) using HIDs which are designed and oriented around flat, 2-dimensional graphical user interfaces; as most comparatively inexpensive computer mice are manufactured and distributed for 2-dimensional UI navigation, the lack of 3D-capable HID usage among most virtual world users is likely due to both the lack of penetration of 3D-capable devices into non-niche, non-gaming markets as well as the generally higher pricing of such devices compared to 2-dimensional HIDs. Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as six degrees of freedom often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces.

Like video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced graphics processing units distributed by Nvidia and AMD) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds. However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware. The first virtual world of this kind was Whyville.net, launched in 1999, built by Numedeon inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation.

==Application domains==
===Social===

Although the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video-conferences. Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like-minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.

===Medical===
Disabled or chronically invalided people of any age can benefit enormously from experiencing the mental and emotional freedom gained by temporarily leaving their disabilities behind and doing, through the medium of their avatars, things as simple and potentially accessible to able, healthy people as walking, running, dancing, sailing, fishing, swimming, surfing, flying, skiing, gardening, exploring and other physical activities which their illnesses or disabilities prevent them from doing in real life. They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use.

The Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or autism for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick. Virtual worlds also enable them to experience and act beyond the restrictions of their illness and help to relieve stress.

Virtual worlds can help players become more familiar and comfortable with actions they may in real-life feel reluctant or embarrassed. For example, in World of Warcraft, /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can &quot;emote&quot; quite simply. And a familiarization with said or similar &quot;emotes&quot; or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth. Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one&#x27;s interaction with real-life interactions.

===Commercial===

As businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market.

Many companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these “virtual stores” is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within &quot;virtual worlds&quot; is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this &quot;in-house&quot;. An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.

Using virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback. Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.

Using virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today&#x27;s business.

Another use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.

According to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management, commercial investments in the &quot;virtual worlds&quot; sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007, and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008. However, the selection process for defining a &quot;virtual worlds&quot; company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.

====E-commerce (legal)====
A number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of Ginko Financial, a bank system featured in Second Life where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to Linden Dollars for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM&#x27;s in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM&#x27;s along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of Ginko Financial.

Civil and criminal laws exist in the real world and are put in place to govern people&#x27;s behavior. Virtual Worlds such as &quot;Eve Online&quot; and &quot;Second Life&quot; also have people and systems that govern them.

Providers of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. &quot;Second Life&quot; for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as &quot;Habbo&quot; enforce clear rules for behaviour, as seen in their terms and conditions.

In some instances, virtual worlds do not need established rules of conduct because actions such as ‘killing’ another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect.

Instances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to £3,115. The player in question has now been suspended as trading in-game cash for real money is against Eve Online&#x27;s terms and conditions.

===Entertainment===

There are many MMORPG virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are IMVU for Windows, PlayStation Home for PlayStation 3, and Second Life for Windows.
Many Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode, PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin.

====Single-player games====

Some single-player video games contain virtual worlds populated by non-player characters (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.)

The virtual worlds found in video games are often split into discrete levels.

Single-player games such as &quot;Minecraft&quot; have semi-infinite procedurally generated worlds that allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the server is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.

At one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of &quot;Halo 3&quot; or &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; is just as much a big database as Microsoft&#x27;s Encarta encyclopedia.

=== Use in education ===
Virtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges. Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their interactive whiteboard with the open-source project Edusim. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.

Multi-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.

Virtual worlds can also be used with virtual learning environments, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge Second Life with Moodle.

Virtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable. Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face.

Some virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is Whyville launched in 1999, which targets kids and teenagers, offering them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in Whyville vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.

Some multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of Second Life for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL) Many specialist types of MUVLE have particular pedagogies associated with them. For instance, George Siemens, Stephen Downes continue to promote the use of a type of MUVLE Dave Cormier coined called a &#x27;MOOC&#x27;. Even though MOOCs were once seen as &quot;next big thing&quot; by universities and online education service providers such as Blackboard Inc, this was in fact what has been called a &quot;stampede.&quot; By early 2013, serious questions emerged about whether MOOCs were simply part of a hype cycle and indeed following that hype whether academia was thus &quot;MOOC&#x27;d out.&quot;

===Language ===
Language learning is the most widespread type of education in virtual worlds.

=== Business ===
Online training overcomes constraints such as distance, infrastructure, accommodation costs and tight scheduling. Although video conferencing may be the most common tool, virtual worlds have been adopted by the business environment for training employees.
For example, Second Life has been used in business schools.

Virtual training content resembles traditional tutorials and testing of user knowledge. Despite the lack of face to face contact and impaired social linking, learning efficiency may not be adversely affected as adults need autonomy in learning and are more self-directed than younger students.

Some companies and public places allow free virtual access to their facilities as an alternative to a video or picture.

==In fiction==
Virtual worlds, virtual reality, and cyberspace are popular fictional motifs. The first was probably John M. Ford&#x27;s 1980 novel &quot;Web of Angels&quot;, and a prominent early example is the work of William Gibson. Virtual worlds are integral to works such as &quot;Tron&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;, &quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot;, &quot;ReBoot&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;, &quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; and &quot;Real Drive&quot;.

In A.K. Dewdney&#x27;s novel, &quot;the Planiverse&quot; (1984), college students create a virtual world called 2DWorld, leading to contact with Arde, a two-dimensional parallel universe.

The main focus of the Japanese cyberpunk, psychological, 13-episode anime titled &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; (1998) is the Wired, a virtual reality world that governs the sum of all electronic communication and machines; outer receptors are used to mentally transport a person &quot;into&quot; the Wired itself as a uniquely different virtual avatar.

Yasutaka Tsutsui&#x27;s novel, &quot;Gaspard in the Morning&quot; (1992), is the story of an individual immersed in the virtual world of a massively multiplayer online game. The plots of isekai works such as &quot;&quot; (1997), &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; (1999), &quot;.hack&quot; (2002), &quot;Sword Art Online&quot; (2002), &quot;Summer Wars&quot; (2009), &quot;Accel World&quot; (2009), &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2011), &quot;Jumanji&quot; (2017), &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; (2021) and &quot;Belle&quot; (2021) also involve the virtual worlds of video games.

The fourth series of the New Zealand TV series &quot;The Tribe&quot; features the birth of Reality Space and the Virtual World that was created by Ram, the computer genius-wizard leader of The Technos.

In 2009, BBC Radio 7 commissioned &quot;Planet B&quot;, set in a virtual world in which a man searches for his girlfriend, believed to be dead, but in fact still alive within the world called &quot;Planet B&quot;. The series is the biggest-ever commission for an original drama series.

The plot of &quot;San Junipero&quot;, series 3, episode 4 of the anthology TV series &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, revolves around a virtual world in which participants can choose time periods to visit. Living people may visit only 5 hours per week; while the dying can choose to permanently preserve their consciousness there.

A South Korean sci-fi fantasy film &quot;Wonderland&quot;, is about a virtual simulated place for people to reunite with a person they may not meet again, by using artificial intelligence.

==Future==
Virtual worlds may lead to a &quot;mobility&quot; of labor that may impact national and organizational competitiveness in a manner similar to the changes seen with the mobility of goods and then the mobility of labor.

Virtual worlds may increasingly function as centers of commerce, trade, and business. Virtual asset trade is massive and growing; e.g., Second Life revenue reached approximately 7 million US Dollars per month, in 2011. Real world firms, such as Coca-Cola, have used virtual worlds to advertise their brand.

<text>The Jamison Valley forms part of the Coxs River canyon system in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is situated approximately 100 kilometres west of Sydney, capital of New South Wales, and a few kilometres south of Katoomba, the main town in the Blue Mountains.

==History==

===Indigenous history===
The traditional inhabitants of the land in what is now known as the Jamison Valley are the Aboriginal Gundungurra people who are estimated to have lived in the region for years, stretching south towards the Burragorang Valley, north of Goulburn.

===European history===
The Jamison Valley was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in honour of Sir John Jamison (1776-1844), a prominent landowner and physician who visited the Blue Mountains with the governor in 1815.

Later, as local towns were beginning to develop, the British naturalist Charles Darwin toured the area. He stayed at the Weatherboard Inn in Wentworth Falls in 1836, and undertook a walk along Jamison Creek to the escarpment of the Jamison Valley, where he was impressed by the views. His route is now commemorated as Darwin&#x27;s Walk, starting in Wilson Park, Wentworth Falls, and following Jamison Creek to the escarpment.

Coal mining in the valley was started around 1872 by John Britty North, with large-scale infrastructure (Katoomba Scenic Railway) used to overcome the terrain.

==Geology==
The Jamison Valley stretches north-south from just outside Katoomba to the Mount Solitary ridge; in this direction it is approximately long. From west to east, it stretches from Narrow Neck Plateau to Kings Tableland, making it approximately wide. Like the entire Sydney and Blue Mountains region, the valley is a sandstone area, characterised by steep sandstone cliffs. Deeper into the soil there is a layer of shale, which is softer than the sandstone. As this layer of shale was eroded by the watercourses, it collapsed and brought the sandstone down with it, creating the characteristic sandstone valleys and canyons of the Blue Mountains, of which the Jamison Valley is one.

The only mountain in the valley is Mount Solitary, which sprawls across the south of the valley from west to east. It is joined to Narrow Neck Plateau by a low ridge which is also the site of the Ruined Castle, a rock formation that is popular with bushwalkers. Immediately east of Mount Solitary is a property called Kedumba Farm, which is no longer worked as a farm.

South of Mount Solitary, the valley sprawls through Cedar and Kedumba Valley down to Coxs River and Lake Burragorang, the lake that was created when Warragamba Dam was built. There is a prohibited area around the river and lake to protect Sydney&#x27;s water supply. Around this area there is a high-tension power line that crosses the valley from east to west; it is followed by a series of service roads that provide access to the powerline and to the area, although much of it is in the prohibited area. These service roads make it possible to do a trek taking in the whole valley, but it is necessary to get permission from Sydney Water to go through the prohibited area. The Katoomba and Jamison topographic maps are essential for any of these walks.

The northern escarpment is deeply serrated, having been carved up by watercourses over millions of years. Watercourses include Jamison Creek, Valley of the Waters Creek, Gordons Creek, Leura Falls Creek, Kedumba River and Causeway Creek. There are also numerous waterfalls, including Wentworth Falls, Empress Falls, Vera Falls, Gordon Falls, Leura Falls and Katoomba Falls.

The valley is densely forested, with eucalypt forest over most of its expanse and occasional pockets of semi-rainforest in gullies, where water is concentrated.

==Activities==
The Jamison Valley is commonly visited by bushwalkers and campers. There is a network of tracks across the northern escarpment, including Darwin&#x27;s Walk, the tracks in the Valley of the Waters and old, neglected tracks that Blue Mountains bushwalkers have been trying to restore for years. Tracks are also found along the cliffs near Leura and Katoomba, as well as tracks like the Federal Pass, located at the foot of the cliffs. 

A track also goes west around to the Ruined Castle and Mount Solitary. The track continues across the mountain but is patchy and suitable only for experienced walkers. It is possible to then go up to Kings Tableland and into Wentworth Falls, making a trek of at least three days. The tracks closer to the escarpment are suitable for one-day walks. Mount Solitary is used mostly for camping trips, although some walkers have been known to make one-day walks to the mountain. In this part of the valley there was formerly a sewage treatment plant, not far below the northern escarpment. It was serviced by a dirt road that went up to Kings Tableland and thence to Wentworth Falls town. The plant was closed down in the 1990s, but the service road remains and can be used by bushwalkers.

==Attractions==
Attractions include Scenic World, a tourist complex north of the valley. And as well as the steepest funicular railway in the world, the Katoomba Scenic Railway, which was originally built to facilitate coal and oil shale mining in the Jamison Valley. Scenic World also offers the Scenic Skyway cable car, which travels over an arm of the Jamison Valley and offers views of Katoomba Falls and Orphan Rock. 

The Three Sisters, which are on the northern escarpment of the valley, are one of Australia&#x27;s most-photographed landmarks.

The Giant Stairway walking track runs down a cliff into the Jamison Valley, near the Three Sisters, providing access to nature walks through the valley.

<doc id="716908" wikidata="Q640562" url="?curid=716908" title="Ventral tegmental area">
<text>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) (tegmentum is Latin for &quot;covering&quot;), also known as the ventral tegmental area of Tsai, or simply ventral tegmentum, is a group of neurons located close to the midline on the floor of the midbrain. The VTA is the origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways; it is widely implicated in the drug and natural reward circuitry of the brain. The VTA plays an important role in a number of processes, including reward cognition (motivational salience, associative learning, and positively-valenced emotions) and orgasm, among others, as well as several psychiatric disorders. Neurons in the VTA project to numerous areas of the brain, ranging from the prefrontal cortex to the caudal brainstem and several regions in between.

== Structure ==
Neurobiologists have often had great difficulty distinguishing the VTA in humans and other primate brains from the substantia nigra (SN) and surrounding nuclei. Originally, the ventral tegmental area was designated as a ‘nucleus’, but over time ‘area’ became the more appropriate term used because of the heterogeneous cytoarchitectonic features of the region and the lack of clear borders that separate it from adjacent regions. Because of the selective limbic-related afferents to the VTA, the cells of the VTA are given the designation A10 to differentiate them from surrounding cells.

===Location===
The ventral tegmental area is in the midbrain between several other major areas, some of which are described here. The mammillary bodies and the posterior hypothalamus, both included in the diencephalon, extend rostrally from the VTA. The red nucleus is situated laterally and oculomotor fibers are situated ventromedially to the VTA. The pons and the hindbrain lie caudally to the VTA. Finally, the substantia nigra is located laterally to the VTA.

=== Subdivisions ===
In 1987, Oades identified four primary nuclei in the VTA A10 group of cells: the nucleus paranigralis (Npn), the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus (Npbp), the nucleus interfascicularis (Nif), and the nucleus linearis (Nln) caudalis and rostralis. Presently, scientists divide the VTA up into four similar zones that are called the paranigral nucleus (PN), the parabrachial pigmented area (PBP), the parafasciculus retroflexus area (PFR), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which approximately adhere to the previous divisions. Some definitions of the VTA also include the midline nuclei (i.e. the interfascicular nucleus, rostral linear nucleus, and central linear nucleus).

The PN and PBP are rich in dopaminergic cells, whereas the other two regions have low densities of these neurons. The PFR and RMTg contain a low density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell bodies that are small in size and lightly stain; the RMTg is composed mostly of GABAergic cells. On the other hand, the PN and PBP consist mainly of medium to large sized TH-positive cell bodies that stain moderately.

=== Inputs ===
Almost all areas receiving projections from the VTA project back to it. Thus, the ventral tegmental area is reciprocally connected with a wide range of structures throughout the brain suggesting that it has a role in the control of function in the phylogenetically newer and highly developed neocortex, as well as that of the phylogenetically older limbic areas.

The VTA is a heterogeneous region consisting of a variety of neurons that are characterized by different neurochemical and neurophysiological properties. Therefore, glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs are not exclusively excitatory nor inhibitory. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the prefrontal cortex, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, lateral habenula, dorsal raphe nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic and preoptic areas. These glutamatergic afferents play a key role in regulating VTA cell firing. When the glutamatergic neurons are activated, the firing rates of the dopamine neurons increase in the VTA and induce burst firing. Studies have shown that these glutamatergic actions in the VTA are critical to the effects of drugs of abuse. In contrast, the tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA, the RMTg) projects to the VTA with GABAergic afferents, functioning as a &quot;master brake&quot; for the VTA dopamine pathways.

GABAergic inputs to the VTA also include the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, dorsal raphe nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). The lateral habenula can also exert an inhibitory effect on dopaminergic neurons in the VTA by exciting RMTg GABAergic neurons, which is thought to play an important role in reward prediction errors. Subpallidal afferents into the VTA are mainly GABAergic and, thus, inhibitory. There is a substantial pathway from the subpallidal area to the VTA. When this pathway is disinhibited, an increase in the dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway amplifies locomotor activity.

There are also cholinergic inputs to the VTA, although less studied than the glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs. Optogenetic studies in mice looking at cholinergic inputs from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus demonstrate that these circuits reinforce the discharge properties of VTA neurons, suggesting a modulatory influence on reward circuits.

The two primary efferent fiber projections of the VTA are the mesocortical and the mesolimbic pathways, which correspond to the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens respectively. In addition, experiments in rodents have identified a mesohabenular pathway consisting of VTA neurons that do not release dopamine, but glutamate and GABA. Other VTA projections, which utilize dopamine as their primary neurotransmitter, are listed below.
* Ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections

:* VTA → Amygdala
:*VTA → Entorhinal cortex
:* VTA → Cingulate gyrus
:* VTA → Hippocampus
:* VTA → Nucleus accumbens
:* VTA → Olfactory bulb
:* VTA → Prefrontal cortex

=== Development ===
Because they develop from common embryonic tissue and partly overlap in their projection fields, Dopaminergic cell groups lack clear anatomical boundaries. During the development of the mammalian brain, both substantia nigra (SN) and VTA neurons initially project to the dorsolateral and ventromedial striatum. However, at birth the SN dopaminergic neurons project exclusively into the dorsolateral striatum, and the VTA dopaminergic neurons project solely into the ventromedial striatum. This pruning of connections occurs through the elimination of the unnecessary collaterals.

== Function ==
As stated above, the VTA, in particular the VTA dopamine neurons, serve several functions in the reward system, motivation, cognition, and drug addiction, and may be the focus of several psychiatric disorders. The VTA has also been shown to process various types of emotion output from the amygdala, where it may also play a role in avoidance and fear-conditioning. Electrophysiological recordings have demonstrated that VTA neurons respond to novel stimuli, unexpected rewards, and reward-predictive sensory cues. The firing pattern of these cells is consistent with the encoding of a reward expectancy error.

In 2006, MRI studies by Helen Fisher and her research team found and documented various emotional states relating to intense love correlated with activity in the VTA, which may help explain obsessive behaviors of rejected partners, since this is shared by the reward system. Nest sharing behavior is associated with increased V1aR expression in the VTA of newly paired zebra finches. However, V1aR expression was not related to female directed song rates, which may indicate a selective role of vasotocin in the VTA on pair maintenance versus courtship behavior.

=== Presence of gap junctions ===
The VTA has been shown to have a large network of GABAergic neurons that are interconnected via gap junctions. This network allows for electrical conduction, which is considerably faster than the chemical conduction of signals between synapses, though less spatially flexible.

=== Neural composition ===
The VTA, like the substantia nigra, is populated with melanin-pigmented dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have suggested that dopaminergic neurons comprise 50-60% of all neurons in the VTA, which is contrary to previous evidence that noted 77% of neurons within the VTA to be dopaminergic. In addition, there is a sizable population of GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a functionally distinct brain structure. These GABAergic neurons regulate the firing of their dopaminergic counterparts that send projections throughout the brain to, but not limited to, the following regions: the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the locus coeruleus. The VTA also contains a small percentage of excitatory glutamatergic neurons.

=== Limbic loop ===
The “limbic loop” is very similar to the direct pathway motor loop of the basal ganglia. In both systems, there are major excitatory inputs from the cortex to the striatum (accumbens nucleus), the midbrain projects neuromodulatory dopamine neurons to the striatum, the striatum makes internuclear connections to the pallidum, and the pallidum has outputs to the thalamus, which projects to the cortex, thus completing the loop. The limbic loop is distinguished from the motor loop by the source and nature of the cortical input, the division of the striatum and pallidum that process the input, the source of the dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain, and the thalamic target of the pallidal output.
The &quot;limbic loop&quot; controls cognitive and affective functioning and the motor loop controls movement.

=== CA3 loop ===
Linking context to reward is important for reward seeking. In 2011, a group of researchers documented a CA3-VTA connection that uses the lateral septum as an intermediary. They used a pseudo-rabies virus (PRV) as a transsynaptic tracer, and injected it into the VTA. They found that unilateral injection into the VTA resulted in bilateral PRV labeling in CA3 beginning 48 hours after injection. Lesions of the caudodorsal lateral septum (cd-LS) before VTA PRV injection resulted in significantly less PRV labeled neurons in CA3. Theta wave stimulation of CA3 resulted in increased firing rates for dopamine cells in the VTA, and decreased firing rates for GABA neurons in the VTA. The identity of VTA neurons was confirmed by neurobiotin labeling of the recording neuron, and then histological staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Temporary inactivation of CA3 via GABA agonists prevented context induced reinstatement of lever pressing for intravenous cocaine.

The authors propose a functional circuit loop where activation of glutamatergic cells in CA3 causes activation of GABAergic cells in cd-LS, which inhibits GABA interneurons in the VTA, releasing the dopamine cells from the tonic inhibition, and leading to an increased firing rate for the dopamine cells.

=== Reward system ===

The dopamine reward circuitry in the human brain involves two projection systems from the ventral midbrain to the nucleus accumbens-olfactory tubercle complex. First, the posteromedial VTA and central linear raphe cells selectively project to the ventromedial striatum, which includes the medial olfactory tubercle and the medial NAC shell. Second, the lateral VTA projects largely to the ventrolateral striatum, which includes the NAC core, the medial NAC shell, and the lateral olfactory tubercle. These pathways are called the meso-ventromedial and the meso-ventrolateral striatal dopamine systems, respectively. The medial projection system is important in the regulation of arousal characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal-directed behavior than the lateral projection system. Unlike the lateral part, the medial one is activated not by rewarding but by noxious stimuli. Therefore, the NAC shell and the posterior VTA are the primary areas involved in the reward system.

== Clinical significance==

=== Disorders ===
The dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to the dorsolateral caudate/putamen and to the ventromedially located nucleus accumbens, respectively, establishing the mesostriatal and the mesolimbic pathways. The close proximity of these two pathways causes them to be grouped together under dopaminergic projections. Several disorders result from the disruption of these two pathways: schizophrenia, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Current research is examining the subtle difference between the neurons that are involved in these conditions and trying to find a way to selectively treat a specific dopamine projection.

=== Drug addiction ===

The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are the primary sites where addictive drugs act. The following are commonly considered to be addictive: cocaine, alcohol, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, and amphetamine and its analogs. These drugs alter the neuromodulatory influence of dopamine on the processing of reinforcement signals by prolonging the action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens or by stimulating the activation of neurons there and also in the VTA. The most common drugs of abuse stimulate the release of dopamine, which creates both their rewarding and the psychomotor effects. Compulsive drug-taking behaviors are a result of the long-lasting or permanent functional changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system arising from repetitive dopamine stimulation. Molecular and cellular adaptations are responsible for a sensitized dopamine activity in the VTA and along the mesolimbic dopamine projection in response to drug abuse. In the VTA of addicted individuals, the activity of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase increases, as does the ability of these neurons to respond to excitatory inputs. The latter effect is secondary to increases in the activity of the transcription factor CREB and the up regulation of GluR1, an important subunit of AMPA receptors for glutamate. These alterations in neural processing could account for the waning influence of adaptive emotional signals in the operation of decision making faculties as drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors become habitual and compulsive.

Experiments in rats have shown that they learn to press a lever for the administration of stimulant drugs into the posterior VTA more readily than into the anterior VTA. Other studies have shown that microinjections of dopaminergic drugs into the nucleus accumbens shell increase locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors, conditioned approach responses, and anticipatory sexual behaviors.

The withdrawal phenomenon occurs because the deficit in reward functioning initiates a distress cycle wherein the drugs become necessary to restore the normal homeostatic state. Recent research has shown that even after the final stages of withdrawal have been passed, drug-seeking behavior can be restored if exposed to the drug or drug-related stimuli.

==Comparative anatomy and evolution==
All studies since 1964 have emphasized the impressive general similarity between the VTA of all mammals from rodents to humans. These studies have focused their efforts on rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, opossum, non-human primates, and humans. There have been slight differences noted, such as changes in the dorsal extent of the A10 cells. To be specific, the dorsal peak of A10 cells is more extensive in primates when compared to other mammals. Furthermore, the number of dopaminergic cells in the VTA increases with phylogenetic progression; for instance, the VTA of the mouse contains approximately 25,000 neurons, while the VTA of a 33-year-old man contains around 450,000 cell bodies.

<text>The Hawkesbury River, or Hawkesbury-Nepean River (Dharug: Dyarubbin) is a river located northwest of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Hawkesbury River and its associated main tributary, the Nepean River, almost encircle the metropolitan region of Sydney. The river between Wisemans Ferry and the Pacific Ocean marks the boundary of Greater Metropolitan Sydney in the south and the Central Coast region to the north.

The Hawkesbury River has its origin at the confluence of the Nepean River and the Grose River, to the north of Penrith and travels for approximately in a north–easterly and then a south–easterly direction to its mouth at Broken Bay, about from the Tasman Sea. The Hawkesbury River is the main tributary of Broken Bay. Secondary tributaries include Brisbane Water and Pittwater, which, together with the Hawkesbury River, flow into Broken Bay and thence into the Tasman Sea north of Barrenjoey Head.

The total catchment area of the river is approximately and the area is generally administered by the Hawkesbury–Nepean Catchment Management Authority.

The land adjacent to the Hawkesbury River was occupied by Aboriginal peoples: the Darkinjung, Darug, Eora, and Kuringgai. They used the river as a source of food and a place for trade. In the languages of the traditional custodians the river is Deerubben or Dyarubbin. 

In March 2021, the river level rose, and many areas were flooded as part of the March 2021 Australian floods.

==Course==

The headwaters of the Hawkesbury River, the Avon River, the Cataract River, and the Cordeaux River, rise only a few kilometres (miles) from the sea, about south of Sydney. These streams start on the inland-facing slopes of the plateau which forms the escarpment behind Wollongong. Flowing north-west, away from the sea, these streams combine to form the Nepean River, and flow north past the towns of Camden and Penrith. Near Penrith, the Warragamba River emerges from its canyon through the Blue Mountains and joins the Nepean. The Warragamba, formed by the joining of the Wollondilly River, the Nattai River, the Kowmung River and Coxs River drains a broad region of New South Wales on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range. The other principal component of the upper Hawkesbury river system, the Grose River, rises in the area of Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains.

Once formed, the Hawkesbury River proper flows generally northwards, albeit with a significant number of meanders. Initially the river passes the towns of Richmond and Windsor, which are the largest settlements on the river. At Windsor, the river is joined by South Creek, which drains much of the urban runoff in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs that does not fall into the Parramatta River catchment. As it flows north, it enters a more rural area, with only small settlements on the river. On this stretch it passes Sackville and Lower Portland, where it is joined by the Colo River. The Colo River and its tributaries drain the northern section of the Blue Mountains.

From Lower Portland, the Hawkesbury River continues flowing northwards to the small community of Wisemans Ferry where it is joined by the Macdonald River. Here its course turns eastwards and the surrounding landscape gradually becomes steeper and more rugged. At Spencer, Mangrove Creek joins the river from the north. From here to the river mouth, road access to the river is limited to a few points.

At Milsons Passage, the river is joined by Berowra Creek from the south. In the area around Brooklyn the river is crossed by the major road and rail services that follow the coast north from Sydney. The river finally reaches the ocean at Broken Bay.

From the confluence of the Nepean and Grose Rivers to the sea, the Hawkesbury River has a total length of some .

==Islands==
Islands in the Hawkesbury River include, in order going downstream are Barr Island, Milson Island, 
Snake Island, Peat Island, Spectacle Island, Long Island, Dangar Island and Lion Island.

==Crossings==
Despite forming the effective boundary of the metropolitan region of Sydney for its entire length, there are very few fixed crossings of the Hawkesbury River proper. Going downstream, these comprise:

In the lower reaches of the river there are also a few passenger ferries that cross the river. These include the Palm Beach Ferry service from Palm Beach to Ettalong and Wagstaffe, and the Hawkesbury River Ferries service from Brooklyn to Dangar Island and Little Wobby.

==History==
===Aboriginal Australian history===
A list from 1829 made by Reverend John McGarvie includes the place names used by the Aboriginal people along the river, including the name of the river itself &quot;Dyarubbin&quot;. An alternative spelling of the Aboriginal name for the river was published as &quot;Deerubbun&quot; in 1870. The two main Aboriginal tribes inhabiting the area were the Wannungine of the coastal area on the lower reaches (below Mangrove Creek) and the Darkinyung people, whose lands were extensive on the lower Hawkesbury to Mangrove Creek, upper Hawkesbury, inland Hunter and lower Blue Mountains. Also known on the banks of the river were the Eora and Guringai people. 

===Australian history since colonisation===

In 1789 two expeditions explored the Hawkesbury to the northwest of Sydney and the Nepean River to the southwest. It took about three years to realise they had discovered the same river system. Hawkesbury River was one of the pivotal positions of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, a series of skirmishes and battles between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the resisting Indigenous clans that took place between late 1780s and late 1810s.

The Hawkesbury River was one of the major transportation routes for transporting food from the surrounding area to Sydney during the 1800s. Boats would wait in the protection of Broken Bay and Pittwater, until favourable weather allowed them to make the ocean journey to Sydney Heads. With the opening of the railway from Sydney to Windsor in 1864, farm produce could be shipped upriver for onward transportation by train. However, by the 1880s the river had become silted up between Sackville and Windsor, and Sackville became the head of navigation for sea-going vessels. Until the end of the 19th century coastal steamers linked Sackville to Sydney.

The Hawkesbury River was given its present name by Governor Phillip in June 1789, after Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool, who at that time was titled Baron Hawkesbury, after the Cotswolds village of Hawkesbury Upton in England, where the Jenkinsons still live. An obelisk was unveiled in 1939 at Brooklyn to commemorate the naming. In 1794, 22 families were granted land at Bardenarang, now known as Pitt Town Bottoms, near Windsor. In that same year, confrontations between Aboriginal people and settlers broke out.

==Controversy==
===Raising of Warragamba Dam===
In May 2017, the New South Wales state government released the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley Flood Risk Management Strategy, that proposed raising the height of Warragamba Dam by an additional 17 metres, using the Climate Change Mitigation Fund. It was claimed that this would reduce the risk of flooding to homes downstream along the Hawkesbury-Nepean river, that is the most at-risk region of Australia to devastating flooding, exacerbated by Global Warming. A large public opposition campaign culminating in the GIVE A DAM movement began to protect the ecological, historical and Indigenous heritage of the additional area prone to flooding due to the raising of the dam wall. A significant portion of the land to be inundated is located within the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area designated by UNESCO, which stated that this status could be revoked if parts of the world heritage area were to be submerged. 
Activists also claim that the raising of the dam wall will give rise to additional developments downstream, which are currently not allowed to build on floodplains with a risk of a one-in-hundred-year flood. They also claim that any raising of the dam wall will be ineffective at flood mitigation, as the Warragamba River only contributes around 15% of water volume to the Hawkesbury-Nepean system. This issue has again been raised after the March 2021 Australian floods, with government ministers disagreeing on what needs to be done.

===Windsor Bridge Replacement===
Plans to replace the Windsor Bridge, and direct traffic through the historic Thompson Square caused significant community opposition culminating in the Community Action for Windsor Bridge (CAWB) movement. Despite this opposition, work on the replacement bridge was completed in May 2020.

===Third Crossing===
Plans for a third crossing at Navua Reserve in Yarramundi, and at North Richmond, 50 metres from the current Richmond Bridge Site are causing public opposition. Activists do not believe that these bridges will alleviate traffic, citing that a North Richmond and Richmond by-pass is required.

==River usage==

===Navigation===
The Hawkesbury River is navigable from Windsor to the sea. There are no dams or locks on the river, and the effects of the tide are felt as far as Windsor.

Whilst use of the river to carry farm produce and other goods has now largely been superseded by road transport, the river remains the only form of access to a significant number of isolated homes and communities. This is especially true in the lower reaches of the river, where the steep and rugged terrain inhibits road construction. One consequence of this is the operation of Australia&#x27;s last riverboat postman, a river service that delivers mail to properties on the river between Brooklyn and Spencer.

===Sporting activities===
The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic, a 111 km canoe race, is held annually in October or November. The race starts at Windsor and finishes at Brooklyn. The Bridge to Bridge is a water ski race that is run in the opposite direction, from Dangar Island to Windsor.
The Australian leg of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series takes place in Hawkesbury.
Windsor and also Dargle ski park on the Hawkesbury river each year hold a Circuit Boat race meeting with boats travelling from all over country

===Commercial fishing===
According to the Hawkesbury Nepean Catchment Management Authority, the Hawkesbury River estuary supports the second-largest commercial coastal fishery of estuary prawns, oysters (prior to the outbreak of QX disease) and fish in New South Wales, with a wholesale value of $6.3 million annually.

<text>Alliance &amp; Leicester plc was a British bank and former building society, formed by the merger in 1985 of the Alliance Building Society and the Leicester Building Society. The business demutualised in the middle of 1997, when it was floated on the London Stock Exchange. It was listed in the FTSE 250 Index, and had been listed in the FTSE 100 Index from April 1997 until June 2008.

After running into difficulty during the financial crisis, the bank was acquired by the Santander Group in October 2008, and transferred its business into Santander UK plc in May 2010.

It was fully integrated and rebranded as Santander by the end of 2011. The bank&#x27;s international subsidiary based in Douglas, Isle of Man, Alliance &amp; Leicester International, continued to use the name Alliance &amp; Leicester, until it was fully merged into Santander UK in May 2013.

==History==
===Early history===
The Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society was formed by the merger of the Alliance Building Society (originally based in and called the Brighton &amp; Sussex Equitable Building Society) and the Leicester Building Society on 1 October 1985. In July 1990 the society acquired Girobank, a major provider of cash handling services to the government and large companies which also offered current accounts from the Post Office.

With other large building societies such as Halifax and Woolwich, Alliance &amp; Leicester decided to float on the London Stock Exchange, generating windfall payments to members worth up to £5,000 each. Flotation took place on 21 April 1997.

From the end of the 1980s until the mid-1990s, Alliance &amp; Leicester undertook a long-running television advertising campaign, featuring comedians Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie.

===Takeover===
Alliance &amp; Leicester had to be offered a secret £3 billion credit line by HM Treasury in November 2007 to prevent insolvency and a run on the bank. On 14 July 2008 the board of A&amp;L recommended that shareholders accept a takeover bid from Banco Santander for around £1.26 billion. This recommendation was ratified by shareholders at meetings on 16 September 2008. The takeover took effect on 10 October 2008, when shares of the company were delisted from the London Stock Exchange.
The bank transferred its business into Santander UK on 28 May 2010, following a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice on 13 May 2010, as part of the procedure within the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

Until this time, Alliance &amp; Leicester was run as a separate institution with its own banking licence while at the same time migrating customer accounts to the Partenon software system. Abbey and the Bradford &amp; Bingley savings business were rebranded in January 2010. Branches of Alliance &amp; Leicester were rebranded at the end of 2010.

==Services==

The four business sectors were mortgage lending and investments, personal banking, commercial banking and treasury. Alliance &amp; Leicester provided current accounts, general insurance, life assurance, unit trusts, asset financing and commercial lending. The bank also operated Alliance &amp; Leicester Commercial Bank. Credit cards were also provided through a partnership with MBNA until the acquisition by Santander.

Cards were subsequently reissued with MBNA branding, while Alliance &amp; Leicester began solely providing Santander branded credit cards, provided by Santander Cards Limited. Selected investment products were also provided, together with those from Legal &amp; General, with which the bank had a partnership.

Alliance &amp; Leicester operated an international subsidiary based on the Isle of Man, which passed to Santander UK.

==Sponsorship==
Between 2003 and 2007, Alliance &amp; Leicester was the main kit sponsor of English football club Leicester City.

<doc id="716919" wikidata="Q2151742" url="?curid=716919" title="Rico (dog)">
<text>Rico (December 13, 1994 – 2008) was a border collie dog who made the news after being studied by animal psychologists Juliane Kaminski and colleagues from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig after his owners reported that he understood more than 200 simple words. Kaminski &quot;et al. &quot;wrote in &quot;Science&quot; that these claims were justified: Rico retrieved an average of 37 out of 40 items correctly. Rico could also remember items&#x27; names for four weeks after his last exposure.

==Testing and results==
Kaminski &quot;et al. &quot;eliminated the Clever Hans effect using a strict protocol: each of the 200 items whose names Rico knew was randomly assigned to one of 20 sets of 10 items. While the owner waited with the dog in a separate room, the experimenter arranged a set of items in the experimental room and then joined the owner and the dog. Next, the experimenter instructed the owner to request that the dog bring two randomly chosen items (one after the other) from the adjacent room.

Rico&#x27;s vocabulary was thus broadly comparable to that of language-trained apes, dolphins, sea lions, and parrots.

Rico also responded correctly to a new word with a single exposure, apparently using a canine equivalent of the fast mapping mechanism used by humans. Subject to the anti-Clever Hansing protocols above, a new object was placed alongside seven familiar objects. Rico was told to retrieve the new object, using a word that he had never heard before. Not only could Rico correctly retrieve the object, he also responded correctly to the name of the new object, presumably using a process of elimination.

==Implications==
&quot;Nature&quot; columnist Paul Bloom of Yale University, a scientist specializing in children&#x27;s acquisition of semantics and language, commented on the study, saying that &quot;for psychologists, dogs may be the new chimpanzees.&quot; He also had reservations, pointing out that children learn new words in many ways, while Rico learns only through rewards for successfully fetching an object. &quot;If any child learned words the way Rico did, the parents would run screaming to the nearest neurologist.&quot;

Border Collies are bred to respond in clever ways to a combination of human vocal commands and whistles, which makes them excellent sheep dogs. Whether Rico&#x27;s clever responses equate to any kind of language comprehension or even whether they demonstrate any language skill (apart from distinguishing the difference among sounds) is at best unclear.

There are several open questions regarding Rico&#x27;s abilities that could serve to further illuminate the nature of canine intelligence:
* Can Rico demonstrate understanding of a word other than by fetching an object?
* Could Rico be told not to fetch a specific object (akin to telling a human child &quot;don&#x27;t touch!&quot;)?
* Can Rico learn a word for any object that is not small and fetchable?
* Can the same results be produced with nonlinguistic sounds?

According to Julia Fischer,
&quot;[Rico&#x27;s ability] tells us he can do simple logic . . . It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s saying to himself, &#x27;I know the others have names, so this new word cannot refer to my familiar toys. It must refer to this new thing.&#x27; Or it goes the other way around, and he&#x27;s thinking, &#x27;I&#x27;ve never seen this one before, so this must be it.&#x27; He&#x27;s actually thinking.&quot;

==Rico in popular culture==
Ukrainian indie-rock band Poupée F made a song called &quot;Rico the Clever&quot;, which is based on this story.

&quot;Finding Rico&quot;, a citizen science investigation named after the dog, was launched in 2021 with the goal of finding and studying other intelligent dogs.

<doc id="716920" wikidata="Q6792789" url="?curid=716920" title="Mauri Pacific">
<text>Mauri Pacific () was a short-lived political party in New Zealand. It was formed in 1998 by five former members of the New Zealand First party. It has often been described as a Māori party. Officially, Mauri Pacific was a multiculturalist party, welcoming anyone who supported racial and cultural harmony. Three of its five MPs were Māori, and two were Pākehā.

The party only contested one election and failed to retain any of its five seats in Parliament. The party disbanded shortly afterwards.

==Origins==
Mauri Pacific had its origins in New Zealand First, a populist party led by former National Party minister Winston Peters. After the 1996 election, New Zealand First won 17 seats, including a sweep of all five Māori electorates. It held the balance of power in Parliament and eventually went into coalition with the incumbent conservative National Party with Peters as deputy prime minister. Gradually, however, the relationship between New Zealand First and the National Party deteriorated. In August 1998, Peters was sacked from Cabinet, and he pulled New Zealand First out of the coalition.

Many New Zealand First MPs were not willing to follow their party back into Opposition, however. Eight of the party&#x27;s sixteen MPs defected, establishing themselves as independents. These MPs supported the National Party government, enabling it to keep a slim majority in Parliament.

Sometime later, five of the newly independent MPs gathered together to establish Mauri Pacific. They were led by Tau Henare, Minister of Māori Affairs and former deputy leader of New Zealand First. The other MPs were Tuku Morgan, Rana Waitai, Jack Elder, and Ann Batten.

Henare, Morgan, and Waitai were previously members of the so-called &quot;tight five&quot;, New Zealand First&#x27;s group of Māori MPs. (The other two members of the &quot;tight five,&quot; Tu Wyllie and Tuariki Delamere, were not involved with Mauri Pacific - Wyllie had remained with New Zealand First, and Delamere eventually joined the small Te Tawharau party.) Because its three highest-profile MPs were Māori, Mauri Pacific was considered by many to be a Māori party. Its policies were generally favourable towards Māori, such as its proposal to give customary Māori law equal status to modern Western law, but the party portrayed this as multiculturalism rather than mere Māori advocacy. The party made a particular attempt to gather support from Pacific Islanders, although was not particularly successful.

==Fate==
Mauri Pacific was not well received by the general public. The behaviour of its members (particularly Tuku Morgan) had been criticised even before the splintering of New Zealand First, and the perception that these MPs had &quot;betrayed&quot; their former party was strong. Many voters believed that Mauri Pacific had been born out of political opportunism, not out of firmly-held principle. It later came out that Henare had challenged Peters for leadership of New Zealand First prior to the split. In addition, the party&#x27;s policies were criticised as vague and unspecific.

In June, Independent and former New Zealand First MP Tuariki Delamere asked his supporters to give their party vote to Mauri Pacific.

In November 1999 one of Mauri Pacific&#x27;s candidates resigned to join the United New Zealand party, citing Mauri Pacific&#x27;s lack of commitment to Asian voters.

In the 1999 elections, Mauri Pacific stood candidates in twenty electorates. It also put forward a party list of twenty-two people. However, the party gained only 4,008 list votes (0.19% of the total), putting it in thirteenth place. None of Mauri Pacific&#x27;s sitting MPs were re-elected or even won second place. Shortly after the election, Mauri Pacific disbanded, and the party was deregistered at its own request by the Electoral Commission.

===Party list===

The party&#x27;s party list at the 1999 election was: Tau Henare, Tuku Morgan, Peta Si&#x27;ulepa, Rana Waitai, Ann Batten, Te Orohi Paul, Atawhai Tibble, Amokura Huia Panoho, Rovina Anderson, Eric Chuah, Danny Turia, Rajesh Masters, Martin Kaipo, Helen Akhtari, Trieste Te Awe Awe, Sharon Faloon, Rayna Waitai, Fa&#x27;amatuainu Iakopo, Laura Mason, Richard Waitai, Kelly Waitai and Api Malu.

<doc id="716924" wikidata="Q3071387" url="?curid=716924" title="Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro">
<text>Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro () is a 1983 Indian Hindi-language satirical black comedy film directed by Kundan Shah and produced by the NFDC. It is a dark satire on the rampant corruption in Indian politics, bureaucracy, news media, and business. The film stars an ensemble cast including Naseeruddin Shah, Ravi Baswani, Om Puri, Pankaj Kapur, Satish Shah, Satish Kaushik, Bhakti Barve and Neena Gupta. &quot;Blow-Up&quot;, a 1966 English-language film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni in which a photographer believes he may have witnessed a murder and unwittingly takes photographs of the killing, was an inspiration for &quot;Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro&quot;.

Kundan Shah won the 1984 Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director for his work. The film was part of the NFDC Retrospective at India International Film Festival in 2006.

==Plot==

Professional photographers Vinod Chopra and Sudhir Mishra open a photo studio in the prestigious Haji Ali area in Bombay. After a disastrous start, they are given some work by Shobha Sen, the editor of &quot;Khabardar&quot; (, a pun on &quot;khabar&quot; meaning news), a publication that exposes the scandalous lives of the rich and the famous. Impressed with their work, Shobha hires them for a story about the connection between the Municipal Commissioner D&#x27;Mello and Tarneja, a builder. They find Tarneja and his business rival Ahuja working together to bribe D&#x27;Mello in order to win the contracts for construction of four fly-overs. Shobha asks the two photographers to create a rift between Tarneja and Ahuja. Vinod, impersonating Albert Pinto, leads Tarneja to believe that Ahuja, with Shobha&#x27;s assistance, is trying to cheat him. Tarneja and Ahuja fight until Tarneja&#x27;s secretary Priya arrives with Assistant Municipal Commissioner Srivastav and tells them that D&#x27;Mello has given the contracts to neither Tarneja nor Ahuja but to someone else. 

Meanwhile, Sudhir and Vinod decide to enter a photography contest promising Rs. 5000/- and take a number of photos all over the city. In one of the photos, they see a man shooting someone and after enlarging it, they realize that the killer is Tarneja. They return to the park where they shot that photo and eventually find out the crime scene. They find the body lying behind the bushes but before the duo can get to the body, it disappears, but they manage to retrieve one of a pair of gold cuff links. 

Sometime later, Srivastav has become the new commissioner. Tarneja has built a fly-over, dedicating it to the memory of late D&#x27;Mello, who he says died of a terminal disease. Vinod and Sudhir attend the inauguration of the fly-over and discover the other cuff link there. They return at night and dig up the area and unearth a coffin containing the dead body of D&#x27;Mello. They take several photos but lose the corpse again. Shobha starts blackmailing Tarneja with the photos. He invites her, Vinod and Sudhir for dinner and plants a time bomb to kill them. The bomb explodes after the three escape. They later find out from the news that the fly-over built in the memory of D&#x27;Mello collapsed and the police suspect sabotage from Vinod and Sudhir. The duo learn about Shobha&#x27;s blackmail and disassociate from her. 

Vinod and Sudhir find out that the body is with Ahuja who had, in an inebriated condition, carried the coffin to his farmhouse. They steal the corpse but not before Tarneja, Ahuja, Srivastav, Shobha and others also get involved resulting in a series of comic mix-ups.

Vinod and Sudhir present their evidence to the police. Tarneja threatens to take Ahuja, Shobha and Srivastav down with him. Srivastav brokers a deal between the four of them. He frames Vinod and Sudhir for the collapse of the bridge, jailing the two. In the final scene, Vinod and Sudhir are shown released from prison. Still in their prison clothes, they make a symbolic cut-throat gesture.

== Reception ==
In 2010, Dhiraj Nayyar in his op-ed for The Indian Express wrote, &quot;In 1983,the average cinema-goer would perhaps have empathised closely with the two heroes and their tangle with the establishment. In contrast,in 2010,the average cinema-goer can perhaps only sympathise with the heroes given that it is perfectly possible to prosper without seeking favour from or getting entangled with a small cabal of crooks.&quot; In a retrospective review in 2020, Jyoti Kanyal of &quot;India Today&quot; wrote, &quot;The film was released in 1983, but it is still relevant in the current times, given the current socio-political state of the country. In 1983, the year before Indira Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, the nation was not in the best of moods. People were raising voices against corruption and intolerance. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro chose to laugh away the bruise. It didn&#x27;t hesitate from references and cross-references to politicians and scams.&quot;

==Re-release==
A digitally restored print of the film was released on 2 November 2012 at selected theaters. The film opened to an enthusiastic welcome from the media.

<text>Zaraysk () is a town and the administrative center of Zaraysky District in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located about southeast from Moscow.

==Geography==
The town stands on the right bank of the Osyotr River, which is a right confluent of the Oka.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, the town belonged to the Princes of Ryazan and was known as Krasnoye (13th century) and Novogorodok-upon-the-Osyotr (14th and 15th centuries). From 1528 onwards, the town was called &quot;the town of Nikola Zarazsky&quot; and only by the beginning of 17th century it received its present name of Zaraysk. Before the 20th century, the town was a part of Ryazan Governorate and its architecture and vernacular dialect seem closer to Ryazan than to Moscow.

In the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Zaraysk was one of the fortresses forming a part of the Great Abatis Border, a fortified line of felled trees, barricades, fortresses, ditches, which were built by Russians as a protection against the hordes of the Crimean and Kazan Tatars. In 1531, a stone kremlin was built in place of the former wooden citadel. The Tatars failed to take the fortress during their raids in 1533, 1541, and 1570. It was briefly captured by the Lisowczycy during the Time of Troubles.

The brick-and-limestone kremlin in Zaraysk still stands and is kept in a rather good condition. The citadel is very small and has a rectangular shape, with only six towers, two of which are pierced by the gates.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Zaraysk serves as the administrative center of Zaraysky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Zaraysky District as the Town of Zaraysk. As a municipal division, the Town of Zaraysk is incorporated within Zaraysky Municipal District as Zaraysk Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Zaraysk is an industrial center of the district, with printing, building materials, foodstuff, and footwear industries.

=== Transport ===
There is a bus line from Moscow; the journey time is 2:30 at 2024.

Zaraysk has a freight railway branch from Lukhovitsy to Zaraysk. It was built almost immediately after the construction of the main line through Lukhovitsy, in 1870. Passenger service was closed in 1969. In the 2020s, the line still used for occasional freight trains.

== Sights ==
The main tourist attraction is a traditional Russian citadel known as the Zaraysk Kremlin. There are five churches in Zaraysk, the oldest of which is St. Nicholas Cathedral, consecrated in 1681. The downtown also has a traditional covered market, or Gostiny Dvor.

=== Archaeology ===
Near the Kremlin wall is an Upper Paleolithic site associated with the Gravettian culture. It first attracted attention when a bison figurine dated 22000 BP was found there. By 2008, many other artefacts were found, including:
# A mammoth&#x27;s rib with drawings on them which are thought to be the images of three mammoths.
# A small bone having an ornament of X-shaped patterns on it.
# Two figurines of humans, presumably of women.
# A piece with a conical shape made of a mammoth&#x27;s bone. The upper part of the cone has been cut, it has a hole in the centre and many patterns. The purpose of this object is not known.

<text>The midbrain is anatomically delineated into the tectum (roof) and the tegmentum (floor). The midbrain tegmentum extends from the substantia nigra to the cerebral aqueduct in a horizontal section of the midbrain. It forms the floor of the midbrain that surrounds below the cerebral aqueduct as well as the floor of the fourth ventricle while the midbrain tectum forms the roof of the fourth ventricle. The tegmentum contains a collection of tracts and nuclei with movement-related, species-specific, and pain-perception functions. The general structures of midbrain tegmentum include red nucleus and the periaqueductal grey matter.
Unlike the midbrain tectum (which is a sensory structure located posteriorly), the midbrain tegmentum, which locates anteriorly, is related to a number of motor functions. Within the tegmentum, the red nucleus is in charge of motor coordination (specifically for limb movements) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) contains critical circuits for modulating behavioral responses to pains. The substantia nigra (black substance) serves an important role in rewarding behaviors such as approaching desired objects. In addition, the substantia nigra forms reciprocal connections with the basal ganglia which are highly correlated with motor functions and learning.

The midbrain tegmentum is also an important part of the dopaminergic system which is essential for feelings of reward and pleasure. Two regions in the midbrain tegmentum are of particular interest. The first one is the substantia nigra which is an important part of the nigrostriatal pathway. This pathway serves to coordinate motor movements and when left unbalanced, motor deficits would follow. For instance, when the dopamine neurons are lost from the substantia nigra, the condition of extreme muscle rigidity occurs as in the Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The second region is the ventral tegmental area (VTA; or simply ventral tegmentum) which is at the hub of the mesolimbic pathway. Specifically, the VTA is the origin of dopaminergic cell bodies from which signals reach the anterior parts of the brain (e.g., frontal lobes) as well as the posterior parts (e.g., cerebellum). Because of this pathway regulates the experience of reward and pleasure, it is not surprising to see that food and drugs affect it the most in terms of a loss of impulse control. That is, the mesolimbic pathway is essential in regulating drug addiction. The potential mechanism is through the associative learning of the environmental cues and reward. For instance, through each drug use, individuals increasingly associate the cues related to each drug use (e.g., the room in which the drug is taken or the people with which individuals take drug). Over time, the drug enhances the dopamine-related, classically-conditioned cues associated with drug taking. As a result, later encounters with these cues will produce and heighten dopamine activity and subsequently prompt individuals to crave drugs. Moreover, excessive mesolimbic dopamine activity plays a role in schizophrenia, a behavioral disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, blunted emotion, agitation, etc. On the other hand, a lack of mesolimbic dopamine activity may induce deficits in attention.

== Geography ==
The Greater Windsor area includes South Windsor, Bligh Park, Windsor Downs, McGraths Hill and Mulgrave suburbs.

Windsor&#x27;s proximity to the Hawkesbury River has resulted in numerous disastrous floods. A horseshoe on the outside wall of the Macquarie Arms pub marks the level the flood peaked at in 1867. During the 1867 flood, beaches along the Hawkesbury River to Barrenjoey were littered with the debris from the town.

== History ==
The Windsor area was originally inhabited by the Dharuk (also Darug) nation of indigenous aboriginal peoples.

Windsor is the fourth oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent. Settlement at the location was first established circa 1791, near the head of navigation on the Hawkesbury River (known as &quot;Deerubbin&quot; in Dharuk). European settlers utilised the fertile river flats for agriculture. The area was originally called Green Hills, but renamed Windsor (after Windsor in England). The town was officially proclaimed in a Government and General Order issued from Government House, Sydney, dated 15 December 1810. Governor Lachlan Macquarie &quot;marked out the district of Green Hills&quot;, which he &quot;... called Windsor&quot;, after Windsor-on-the-Thames.

While in Windsor, Governor Macquarie ordered the main institutions of organised settlement to be erected, including a church, school-house, gaol and &quot;commodious inn&quot; (Macquarie Arms Hotel). Of these new buildings, the most outstanding was Francis Greenway&#x27;s St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church. Governor Macquarie himself chose the site for the church. Samuel Marsden, principal chaplain of the colony, consecrated the church on 8 December 1822.

Windsor was chosen during settlement because of its agricultural potential and accessible location. In 1813 a report was given to Governor Macquarie from Earl Bathurst detailing a proposed invasion of the Hawkesbury River by France. This planned invasion that did not eventuate targeted the Windsor granary in order to cut off supply to Sydney, demonstrating the relative importance of this new settlement on a global scale. Windsor is north-west of Sydney, and easily accessible by coastal shipping from Sydney along the Hawkesbury River. It was known as the &quot;bread basket&quot;, ensuring the survival of the starving colony. The extensive agriculture caused major silting in the Hawkesbury River; by the 1890s the Hawkesbury River had become so blocked with silt, ships could not travel up to Windsor from the coast. By then, a railway (in 1864) and road (in 1814) had been built to compensate.

On 1 January 1803, Daniel Egan was born in Windsor. He went on to become Mayor of Sydney in 1853.

== Media ==
The studios of local community radio station, Hawkesbury Radio, are located in Windsor.

Pitt Town, which is north west of Windsor, was a filming location for the Channel 7 television series &quot;A Country Practice.&quot; It was the set of the fictional town of Wandin Valley. The opening credits featured the former Court House Hotel, Windsor at 37–39 North Street as the doctor&#x27;s clinic. Windsor High School at Mulgrave was also used as the fictional Burrigan High School in the series

== Transport ==
Urban sprawl of metropolitan Sydney has almost reached Windsor. The town is now regarded as an outer suburb which has retained its appeal as a small country town. Growth in the Hawkesbury area has created an increased need for public transport and roads. Most people from Windsor traveled to work by car in 2016 (68.9%). Only 9.0% of people used public transport.

Windsor railway station opened 1 December 1864. It is on the Richmond branch.

Located in the town centre is the Windsor Bridge which was constructed in 1874. It is the oldest existing crossing of the Hawkesbury River. There was a proposal in 2013 by the Government of New South Wales to demolish the existing bridge and replace it with a safer bridge. It was suggested by the political activist group Community Action for Windsor Bridge (CAWB) that a bypass is a better option to preserve history, ensure safety, and better manage the congestion of Windsor Road. Nevertheless, the new bridge was constructed despite the protests. On 18 May 2020 the replacement bridge was opened to traffic within Windsor, NSW.

The new bridge has a centreline height of 17.8 metres Australian Height Datum (AHD) (ie significantly higher than the typical water level – peak flood levels at Windsor bridge are 11.1 metres AHD and 17.2 metres AHD for the five year and 100 year ARI events respectively.).
In 2021 the bridge was closed due to flooding in March 2021, and further work on the new bridge was completed

Windsor is also connected to Parramatta via the Windsor Road cycleway, with much of its route via the North-West T-way.

== Commercial area ==
The Windsor Mall Sunday Market are held weekly on Sunday between 9.00am to 3.00pm. The markets contain stalls selling jewellery, books, arts and crafts, paintings, fashion items, fresh locally grown produce, locally produced jams and many food and drink stands.

<text>LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is a 4-6-2 (&quot;Pacific&quot;) steam locomotive built in 1938 for operation on the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) at Doncaster Works to a design of Nigel Gresley. Its streamlined, wind tunnel tested design allowed it to haul long distance express passenger services at high speeds. On 3 July 1938, &quot;Mallard&quot; broke the world speed record for steam locomotives at , which still stands today.

While in British Railways days regular steam-hauled rail services in the UK were officially limited to a &#x27;line speed&#x27;, before the war, the A4s had to run significantly above just to keep schedule on trains such as the &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot; and &quot;The Coronation&quot;, with the engines reaching 100 mph on many occasions. &quot;Mallard&quot; covered almost one and a half million miles (2.4 million km) before it was retired in 1963.

The locomotive is long and weighs 165 long tons (168 tonnes, 369,600 lbs), including the tender. It is painted LNER garter blue with red wheels and steel rims.

&quot;Mallard&quot; is now part of the National Collection and preserved at the National Railway Museum in York.

==History==

In 1936, Nigel Gresley, the chief mechanical engineer of the LNER, ordered a new batch of six 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; Class A4 engines to be built at Doncaster Works. The A4s were known for their distinct streamlined and aerodynamic design, and designed for hauling long distance express passenger services at high speeds. The first batch comprised four locomotives which entered service in 1935, and had &quot;Silver&quot; in their names as they were to haul the non-stop &quot;The Silver Jubilee&quot; service between London King&#x27;s Cross and Newcastle.

The six new A4s were named after a bird, influenced by Gresley&#x27;s fondness of breeding wild birds, and incorporated some modifications to maximise the possibilities of the original streamlined design. This included a new, state-of-the-art double Kylchap chimney and blastpipe, allowing the smoke to be distributed more freely. However, the problem of smoke being dispersed at the front of the locomotive, in turn giving drivers only a narrow viewing window, remained unsolved, and Gresley was determined to find a solution, using &quot;Mallard&quot;, the 28th A4 locomotive as a test. It was solved after a wooden model at 1/12th of the original size of &quot;Mallard&quot; was made to undergo smoke tests in a wind tunnel setting, using a tunnel made of plasticine. After a period of testing, a solution to deflect the smoke was found and the modification was incorporated into &quot;Mallard&quot;″s final design.

&quot;Mallard&quot; was released from Doncaster Works and entered service on 3 March 1938, carrying the number of 4468. It wore a variety of liveries throughout its career, these were: garter blue as 4468, LNER wartime black from 13 June 1942, later wartime black with the tender marked as &quot;NE&quot; from 21 October 1943 as 22 with yellow small stencilled numbers, post-war garter blue with white and red lining from 5 March 1948 with stainless steel cabside number 22, British Railways dark blue as 60022 from 16 September 1949, Brunswick green from 4 July 1952 and its original LNER garter blue for preservation in 1963.

The A4 class was built with streamlined valances, or side skirting, but this was removed during the war to ease maintenance. &quot;Mallard&quot; lost its valances during a works visit on 13 June 1942, regaining them in preservation in 1963.

&quot;Mallard&quot; was fitted with twelve boilers during its 25-year career. These boilers were: 9024 (from construction), 8959 (from 4496 &quot;Golden Shuttle&quot;, 13 June 1942), 8907 (from 2511 &quot;Silver King&quot;, 1 August 1946), 8948 (from 31 &quot;Golden Plover&quot;, &quot;Walter K Whigham&quot;, 10 January 1951), 29301 (from 60019 &quot;Bittern&quot;, 4 July 1952), 29315 (from 60014 &quot;Silver Link&quot;, 23 April 1954), 29328 (new-build boiler, 7 June 1957), 29308 (from 60008 &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, 27 August 1958), 29310 (from 60009 &quot;Union of South Africa&quot;, 9 March 1960) and 27965 (from 60009 &quot;Union of South Africa&quot;, 10 August 1961).

&quot;Mallard&quot; has had seven tenders throughout its career. It started off with a non-corridor tender in 1938, had corridor design tenders during its British Railways days and was fitted with a non-corridor tender in 1963 to recreate its original appearance. The tenders it has been fitted with are: 5642 (3 March 1938 – 14 March 1939), 5639 (5 May 1939 – 16 January 1948), 5323 (5 March 1948 – 12 March 1953), 5648 (12 March 1953 – 21 July 1958), 5330 (27 August 1958 – 30 May 1962), 5651 (30 May 1962 – 25 April 1963) and 5670 (current tender, masquerading as original tender 5642).

The original non-corridor tender 5642 was later coupled to sister locomotive 60026 &quot;Miles Beevor&quot; when it was withdrawn on 21 December 1965 but later came into the possession of the A4 Preservation Society who had purchased this locomotive from the scrapyard to assist the restoration of classmate 4498 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot;. It was scrapped in 1973 as being surplus to requirements, by which time it had also donated parts to the restoration of A3 class locomotive 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, which had recently returned from America and was being restored at Derby Workshops.

&quot;Mallard&quot; was allocated to three sheds during its career: Doncaster, transferring on 21 October 1943 to Grantham and on 11 April 1948 to Kings Cross Top Shed.

===1938 speed record===
On 3 July 1938, &quot;Mallard&quot; claimed the world speed record for steam locomotives at during a trial run of a new, quick-acting brake, known as the Westinghouse QSA brake. The speed was achieved during the downward grade of Stoke Bank, south of Grantham at milepost 90¼, between Little Bytham and Essendine stations. &quot;Mallard&quot; hauled a seven-coach train, including a dynamometer car which housed apparatus to record the speed. The speed it recorded exceeded the previous record speed of set in Germany in 1936 by DRG Class 05 No. 002. &quot;Mallard&quot; was just four months old at the time of the record, and was operated by driver Joseph Duddington, a man renowned within the LNER for taking calculated risks, and fireman Thomas Bray. Upon arrival at London King&#x27;s Cross, driver Duddington and inspector Sid Jenkins were quoted as saying that they thought a speed of would have been possible if the train did not need to slow for a set of junctions at Essendine. There was also a permanent speed restriction of just north of Grantham station, which slowed the train as they sought to build up maximum speed for the descent of Stoke Bank.

The A4 class previously had problems with the big end bearing for the middle cylinder, so the big end was fitted with a &quot;stink bomb&quot; of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. After attaining the record speed, the middle big end did overheat and the crew reduced speed, running at onwards to Peterborough, after which &quot;Mallard&quot; was sent to Doncaster Works for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case &quot;Mallard&quot; did not make it back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced &quot;Mallard&quot; at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.
&quot;Mallard&quot; topped Stoke Bank at and accelerated downhill. The speeds at the end of each from the summit were recorded as: , , , , , and ; half-mile (800 m) readings after that gave 120, 122, 123, 124 and finally 125 mph (194, 197, 198, 200 and 201 km/h). However, the dynamometer car tracks the current speed every half second on a paper roll moving for every mile travelled. Speeds could be calculated by measuring the distance between the timing marks. Immediately after the run staff in the dynamometer car calculated the speed over five second intervals, finding a maximum of . Although was seen for a single second, Gresley would not accept this as a reliable measurement and an hour was the figure published.

Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. In 1948, plaques proposed and designed by Harry Underwood, a headmaster and keen steam enthusiast, were fixed onto the locomotive which stated , and this became the generally accepted speed. Despite this, some writers have commented on the implausibility of the rapid changes in speed. A recent analysis has claimed that the paper roll was not moving at a constant rate, and the peaks and troughs in the speed curve resulting in claims of held for 5 seconds and for one second were just a result of this measuring inaccuracy. It concluded that a verifiable maximum speed being a sustained for almost a mile. On 3 July 2013, the 75th anniversary of the speed record, all six surviving A4 locomotives were brought together at the National Railway Museum.

====Rival claims====
&quot;Mallard&quot;″s record has never been officially exceeded by a steam locomotive, although a German DRG Class 05 reached in 1936 on a horizontal stretch of track, unlike Stoke Bank, which is slightly downhill. However, the Class 05 hauled a four-coach train of 197 tons, whereas &quot;Mallard&quot;″s seven-coach train weighed 240 tons.

Several speed claims are tied to the Pennsylvania Railroad and their various duplex locomotive classes. The S1 class during its lifetime was attributed to having reached anywhere from to . Speed claims tied to the T1 class state the locomotive reached speeds up to . New build project Pennsylvania Railroad 5550 which is constructing a brand new T1, has stated their desire to test the locomotive when completed to see if it can claim the speed record from &quot;Mallard&quot;.

===1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials===

In 1948, shortly after the formation of British Railways, the decision was taken to test locomotives from all of the former &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies to find the best attributes of speed, power and efficiency with coal and water. There were two ways of testing and comparing locomotives: either at the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station, which was not ready until late 1948 or by testing in the field itself. The results of the 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials would be used to help design the British Railways Standard locomotives.

The express passenger locomotive designs which would be compared were: London Midland Region (former LMS) &quot;Princess Coronation&quot; class, Eastern Region (former LNER) Class A4, Southern Region (former Southern) Merchant Navy class and Western Region (former GWR) King class.

Three Gresley A4 locomotives were chosen to represent the Eastern Region: E22 &quot;Mallard&quot;, 60033 &quot;Seagull&quot; and 60034 &quot;Lord Faringdon&quot;. All of the locomotives had the Kylchap double blastpipe chimney arrangement and were fresh from Doncaster works. &quot;Mallard&quot; had emerged from Doncaster with a fresh coat of post-war garter blue livery, stainless steel numbers 22 with a small &#x27;E&#x27; painted above them (for Eastern region), new boiler (its fourth) and third tender of its career.

E22 &quot;Mallard&quot; was used on 8 June 1948 on the London Waterloo to Exeter route. Driver Marrable took the famous A4 with a load of 481 tons tare, 505 tons full, the same that had been used on the previous trip by 35018 British India Line. &quot;Mallard&quot; reached Clapham Junction in 6 minutes 57 seconds and Woking in 28 minutes 47 seconds. At Hook there were adverse signals, causing &quot;Mallard&quot; to slow to a crawl. Even so, Salisbury was reached in 108 minutes and 28 seconds. Despite the signals earlier, the train was only 5-and-a-half minutes late. The net time was 95.5 minutes.

&quot;Mallard&quot; failed after this trial and 60033 &quot;Seagull&quot; took over. On 10 June &quot;Seagull&quot; achieved the run in 96 minutes 22 seconds, but had departed 3 minutes late, meaning &quot;Seagull&quot; had arrived with the same load 3.5 minutes early. For &quot;Mallard&quot;, the trials were over, but &quot;Mallard&quot; returned to the Waterloo-Exeter line for a Locomotive Club of Great Britain (LCGB) railtour on 24 February 1963.

===The Elizabethan===

The &quot;Elizabethan Express&quot; was a flagship express that ran non-stop over the between London King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh Waverley from 1953 to the mid-1960s. Until September 1961 it was steam-hauled. In its day it was the longest non-stop run in the world. Two crews were needed for the six-and-a-half-hour run. They were able to change over mid-journey by using a corridor tender. Only 22 locomotives including &quot;Mallard&quot; had such a tender. In December 1961, &quot;Mallard&quot; hauled the final steam-hauled northbound &quot;Elizabethan&quot; train.

==Preservation==
Following the introduction of diesel and electric trains, many steam locomotives across the UK were set to be scrapped. In December 1960, a notification was issued to have &quot;Mallard&quot; preserved, which was not confirmed until 29 August 1962. Its final revenue earning service took place on 25 April 1963, after which the locomotive was sent to Doncaster Works for repair and restored to its original condition.

In February 1963, &quot;Mallard&quot; was sent to Nine Elms depot, followed by the Museum of British Transport museum in Clapham, south London. It then ran a series of special trains, including a run from Doncaster via Nottingham Victoria to Clapham Junction. Following a relaxation of the ban on steam locomotives in the UK in the 1970s, &quot;Mallard&quot; hauled a train from Stewarts Lane, Battersea to York via the Midland Main Line in on 12 April 1975 in preparation for the opening of the National Railway Museum, where it remained. This was followed by periods on display at York and Doncaster Works in June 1977 and June 1978, respectively. In the 1980s, &quot;Mallard&quot; was restored to working order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its 1938 record speed run. Its first run took place on 26 March 1986 from York to Doncaster, and a series of other special trains were completed across England in 1986 to 1987. The locomotive&#x27;s final run in operation was on 3 July 1988 from Doncaster to Scarborough and back, which was attended by several family members of the original train crew on the 3 July 1938 run. The trip was related to a special commemorative postage stamp featuring &quot;Mallard&quot;.

In July 2003, &quot;Mallard&quot; was put on display outside the National Railway Museum as part of the 150th anniversary of Doncaster Works. It was taken outside again in July 2008 beside three other preserved A4s located in the UK, thus reuniting them for the first time since preservation. In 2013, six preserved A4s, including two in the United States and Canada, reunited at the museum for the 75th anniversary of &quot;Mallard&quot;″s recording breaking run. The same six A4s were displayed together at the National Railway Museum Shildon for a short time. In June 2010, &quot;Mallard&quot; was taken to Shildon where it remained a static exhibit until July 2011, when it returned to York. In July 2019, it made its first outside appearance since 2014 when it was displayed at York station alongside a Class 800 &quot;Azuma&quot; as part of the latter&#x27;s launch by the London North Eastern Railway.

==Models==
Hornby Dublo first produced a model of &quot;Mallard&quot; in BR loco green for their 3-rail OO gauge system in 1958. Bachmann and Hornby have subsequently released models of &quot;Mallard&quot; several times in Garter Blue. Hornby released a model of &quot;Mallard&quot; in BR Express Passenger Blue and a limited edition model in BR Dark Loco Green. Hornby has also released a limited edition model of 4468 in LNER form along with the other five surviving A4s in 2013. In 2023 Hornby released a TT120 scale model of &quot;Mallard&quot; in LNER garter blue livery along with &quot;Silver King&quot; in BR Brunswick green livery and &quot;Falcon&quot; in BR garter blue livery with white lining.

A Corgi 1:120 scale model in Garter Blue as part of a series entitled &quot;Rail Legends&quot; is available.

==In culture==
* A painting of &quot;Mallard&quot; in her immediate post-war condition features on the 1993 Blur album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;. The painting was a stock image that Stylorouge—Blur&#x27;s design consultants—obtained from a photo library in Halifax. According to &quot;Design Week&quot; magazine, the painting &quot;evoked the feel of a Just William schoolboy&#x27;s pre-war Britain&quot;.
* The 2013 song &quot;East Coast Racer&quot; by British progressive rock band Big Big Train tells the story of &quot;Mallard&quot;″s record-breaking run.
* On the US TV crime drama &quot;NCIS&quot;, the Hornby model of &quot;Mallard&quot; is a usual feature in some of the scenes that take place within the autopsy department. The model can usually be seen above the desk at the end of the room, and belongs to Dr. Donald &quot;Ducky&quot; Mallard (played by David McCallum).
* A brick sculpture of &quot;Mallard&quot;, known as the &quot;Brick Train&quot; and created by David Mach in 1997, can be found alongside the A66 road on the eastern outskirts of the town of Darlington, County Durham.

<doc id="716940" wikidata="Q86659878" url="?curid=716940" title="Great Zasechnaya cherta">
<text>The Zasechnaya cherta () was a chain of fortification lines, created by Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia to protect it from the Crimean-Nogai Raids that ravaged the southern provinces of the country via the Muravsky Trail during the Russo-Crimean Wars. It was south of the original line along the Oka River. It also served as a border between the Muscovite State and the steppe nomads. As a fortification line stretching for hundreds of kilometers, the Great Abatis Border is analogous to the Great Wall of China and the Roman limes.

Abatis is a military term for a field fortification made by cutting down trees. The line was built from the felled trees arranged as a barricade and fortified by ditches and earth mounds, palisades, watch towers and natural features like lakes and swamps. The width of the abatis totalled up to several hundred meters. In the most dangerous places the abatis was doubled, trebled etc., the gates and small wooden fortresses were created to check the passers. Peasants who lived nearby were forbidden to settle or cut wood in the area, but were required by authorities to spend part of their time supporting and renewing the fortifications. In the autumn, large areas of steppegrass beyond the line were burned to deny fodder to raiders.

Stone and wooden kremlins of the towns were also included in the Great Abatis Line. Among these towns were: Serpukhov, Kolomna, Zaraysk, Tula, Ryazan, Belyov. Other fortresses in the line were smaller ostrogs.

==Other Russian fortification lines==
There were a large number of fortification lines in Russian history and it is difficult to get good information on them.
The lines naturally moved south as the Russian state expanded. The earliest reference to abatis fortifications appears to be in a Novgorod chronicle of 1137-1139. Abatis lines began appearing in southern Rus&#x27; in the 13th century. The &#x27;Great Abatis Line&#x27; extended from Bryansk to Meschera and was nominally completed in 1566. It was guarded by a local militia of about 35,000 in the second half of the 16th century. Another source gives an annual callup of 65,000. Behind the line was a mobile army headquartered in Tula (6,279 men in 1616, 17,005 in 1636).

There are several notable lines. The oldest one (finished by 1563-1566) ran from Nizhniy Novgorod along the Oka River to Kozelsk, and was built by Ivan the Terrible. The next one built, followed the Alatyr - Orel - Novgorod Seversky - Putivl line. Feodor I of Russia had the abatis built on the Livny - Kursk - Voronezh - Belgorod. Simbirsk line about 1640, and continued the Belgorod line from Tambov to Simbirsk on the Volga River. In 1730-31 the Kama line separated Kazan from the Bashkirs. From about 1736 on, a Samara-Orenburg line closed in the Bashkirs from the south.

<text>The Colo River, a perennial stream that is part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment, is located in the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course==
The Colo River rises on the Great Dividing Range, northeast of Newnes, formed by the confluence of the Wolgan River and the Capertee River, which respectively drain the Wolgan and Capertee Valleys north of Lithgow. Colo River flows eastwards and then south through a deep gorge in the northern section of the Blue Mountains. The majority of the river lies in Wollemi National Park. The middle Colo is inaccessible, rugged and remote. The wilderness was saved from development, logging and damming in the late 1970s by the Colo Wilderness Preservation Society and other environmentalists. Emerging from the wilderness region, the lower part of the Colo River flows through a scenic, narrow agricultural valley and reaches the Hawkesbury River at Lower Portland north of Windsor. Tributaries of the Colo include the Wollangambe River and Wollemi Creek. The river descends over its course.

At , the river is crossed by the Putty Road (B84).

Parts of the area surrounding the river, including both the Blue Mountains National Park and the Wollemi National Park have received World Heritage listing, due in part to the discovery of the Wollemi Pine, often described as a &#x27;living fossil&#x27; from the age of the dinosaurs. The Colo River gorge contains many boulder-rapids that alternate with deep pools. Even though this area is relatively close to the Sydney metropolitan area, the Colo River flows through the largest wilderness area in New South Wales. Local volunteer bush regeneration groups such as the &quot;Friends of the Colo&quot; have been helping eradicate invasive exotic weeds in the area surrounding the river.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Colo River are the Australian Aboriginal peoples of the Darug nation.

The area of the lower Colo River was first explored by Europeans in June 1789 by Governor Phillip and settlement commenced from the early 1800s via land grants, that were significantly expanded from 1833. The Colo River was an important transport corridor in the period before motor vehicles, with produce and goods transported down the Hawkesbury River to Sydney.

==Recreation==
Bushwalking, canoeing, fishing, and accommodation retreats are all popular recreation activities along various parts of the Colo River.

<doc id="716949" wikidata="Q6538078" url="?curid=716949" title="Leyland brothers">
<text>The Leyland brothers were an English-born Australian duo of explorers and documentary filmmakers, consisting of Michael James &quot;Mike&quot; Leyland, MBE (4 September 1941 – 14 September 2009) and Malcolm Rex &quot;Mal&quot; Leyland, MBE (born 2 October 1944).

The Leylands were best known for their popular television show, &quot;Ask the Leyland Brothers&quot;, which aired from 1976 to 1980 and 1983 to 1984. Through their exploits the brothers introduced many Australians to the sights of the Australian outback.

==Biography==
===Early life===
In 1950, when Mike was eight and Mal was five they migrated with their parents from Hitchin, North Hertfordshire, England to Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Their parents ran a local store. Mike would later attend Wallsend Public School. The brothers grew up watching documentaries by Armand and Michaela Denis.

When aged 15, Mike won a trip to the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne from a cartoon-drawing competition, and his father bought him a 16mm movie camera to take along. The teenage brothers would later use the camera to film themselves and their friends as they explored outback New South Wales. They also planned to use the camera to film a journey to Uluru in their father&#x27;s Morris Minor; a mechanic friend persuaded them to trade in the car for an old Land Rover. Once there the brothers then attempted to drive the vehicle up the side of the rock but were unsuccessful.

===Documentary films and television series===

Mike started his media career aged 21 as a news cameraman at NBN Television, whilst Mal, age 18, was working as a cadet at Newcastle&#x27;s now-defunct newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;.

The Leylands soon realised there existed a wide public interest in seeing the Australian outback, and starting in 1961 they set out on their own to make documentary films that explored Australia. The first, &quot;Down the Darling&quot;, was released in 1963, and saw the brothers becoming the first people to travel the length of the Darling River in an aluminium dinghy. For their next adventure, 1966&#x27;s &quot;Wheels Across a Wilderness&quot;, the brothers decided to film a 5-month 4WD trek from the western-most point of Australia to the eastern-most point of the country, crossing straight through the arid interior while bringing along a sample of water from the Indian Ocean all the way with them. During the journey the Leylands became the first filmmakers to capture Uluru during the wet season. One of the two 1956 Land Rover Series I 4WDs the brothers completed their journey with is now on display at the National Motor Museum of Australia.

A third expedition, 1969&#x27;s &quot;Open Boat to Adventure&quot;, saw them retrace the maritime voyage of Matthew Flinders from Darwin to Sydney in a small open boat, which took six months to complete and along the way saw Mal electrocuted and the brothers rescued from rough seas by a prawn trawler. “What a cocky, arrogant pair of smart-arses Mike and I were&quot;, Mal Leyland later reflected in his 2015 memoir. A fourth film, &quot;The Wet&quot;, followed in 1972, documenting a journey through the Northern Territory to Kakadu National Park via Darwin.

The Leylands initially edited their films in a makeshift editing suite in their basement. The brothers arranged film screenings at small cinemas and halls to show their documentaries, and would net up to $15,000 ($201,913 in 2020) from a two-week showing. The popularity of their films lead to several television series being developed, the first being 1970&#x27;s &quot;Off the Beaten Track&quot;.

Their most popular TV series, &quot;Ask the Leyland Brothers&quot;, ran on Australian television on the Nine Network from 1976 to 1980, and again from 1983 to 1984. The show involved viewers writing in with questions and requests for places they wanted to see the brothers visit, in which they would do so in a Volkswagen Kombi van (and later two 4WD vehicles), often along with their wives and children. All 156 episodes were shot in the Super 8 mm film format, and edited in the style of a home movie.

The show became extremely successful, and at its height attracted 2.5 million viewers an episode, which was about 40% of the audience at the time. The Leylands became famous celebrities, with viewers often recognising the brothers and their wives as they scouted for locations, sometimes forcing them to go incognito. Satirical television host Norman Gunston called them “the Starsky and Hutch of the dead centre” during an interview with the brothers on a 1976 episode of his popular variety program. The success of the series provided many Australian television viewers with their first look at some of the lesser-known parts of the Australian outback as well as New Zealand, and its theme song remains well known amongst older Australians.

A documentary series called &quot;Leyland Brothers&#x27; World&quot; followed in the late 1980s. Rather than viewers writing in and asking the Leyland brothers to visit a particular place in Australia, it focused on exploration by the Leyland brothers and their families around Australia in a double-decker bus.

===Leyland Brothers World theme park, bankruptcy and split===

Although the continued success of their films and television series made the brothers wealthy, they made efforts to spread out their business interests by investing in property and looked to leverage their name in the hospitality and tourism sector. In November 1990 the Leyland brothers opened the Leyland Brothers World theme park at North Arm Cove on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. The park contained amusement rides, a playground, a roadhouse and a 1/40 scale replica of Uluru along with other attractions, as well as a bush camp with a capacity to host 144 guests.

Despite an estimated annual attendance of about 400,000 people, in July 1992 BDO Nelson was appointed receiver and manager of the park when the Leylands failed to meet their loan commitments to the Commonwealth Bank. In a 1997 article in &quot;The Sunday Age&quot;, Mike Leyland said that the initial $1 million loan had blown out due to rain during construction and was further compounded by a 27% interest rate. The theme park was sold to new owners in November 1992 for $800,000, and as of 2025 continues to operate as the Great Aussie Bush Camp. The brothers went bankrupt.

The failure of Leyland Brothers World as well as personal tensions that simmered in the years beforehand led to a personal and professional rift between the two brothers and they went their separate ways, dissolving their 31-year filmmaking partnership. In 2015, Mal Leyland told &quot;Australian Story&quot; that &quot;in hindsight, Leyland Brothers World was a huge mistake, the biggest mistake we ever made.&quot; Contrary to media speculation that they weren&#x27;t on speaking terms, in the years afterwards the brothers still saw each other regularly, and even shared information about their new independent television projects on rival networks.

===Later life===
After the 1992 bankruptcy, Mike and his second wife Margie ran a New Lambton video store and worked for the park&#x27;s new owner. In 1997 Mike sold part of his Tea Gardens property to fund the production of a far-north Queensland film for Channel Seven. Mike and his wife Margie later signed a contract with Seven for a further 12 one-hour documentaries, the first of which aired in 1998 in &quot;The World Around Us&quot; slot. The series of documentaries were later released on DVD under the title &quot;Travel All Over The Countryside&quot;. On 14 September 2009, Mike Leyland died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease; he was 68 years old. Mal had met with his brother shortly before he died, suggesting that they go on one last adventure. Mike is survived by his wife Margie, his daughters Kerry, Sandy and Dawn, his stepdaughters Sarah and Alison, and seven grandchildren.

Mal and his wife Laraine ran a photo processing lab in Queensland and in 1997 launched a bi-monthly travel magazine, &quot;Leyland&#x27;s Australia&quot;. In 2000 Mal produced the television show &quot;Leyland&#x27;s Australia&quot;, with Laraine, daughter Carmen and her husband Robert Scott, in which they travelled around Australia in an RV and a camping trailer. In April 2000 Channel Nine cancelled the show after six episodes but the series was then picked up by Network Ten. Mal and Laraine have also written travel stories for &quot;ROAM&quot; magazine, a number of novels and cookbooks, and in 2015, Mal published his memoirs, entitled &quot;Still Travelling&quot;. Laraine died on 22 November 2018 in Tasmania aged 75. In 2019 Mal became a travel correspondent for &quot;Studio 10&quot;, and as of 2021 contributes to &quot;The Camping &amp; Off Road Radio Show&quot;. In 2023 he announced plans to film a project with daughter Carmen.

<text>Bolghar () was intermittently the capital of Volga Bulgaria from the 10th to the 13th centuries, along with Bilyar and Nur-Suvar. It was situated on the bank of the Volga River, about 30 km downstream from its confluence with the Kama River and some 130 km from modern Kazan in what is now Spassky District. West of it lies a small modern town, since 1991 known as [[Bolgar, Spassky District, Republic of Tatarstan|Bolgar]]. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex (ancient Bolghar hill fort) to the World Heritage List in 2014. 


== History ==
The city is supposed to have been the capital of Volga Bulgaria from as early as the 10th century. Regular Kievan Rus&#x27; incursions along the Volga, and internecine fights, forced the Volga Bulgar kings (khagans) to intermittently move their capital to Bilyar.

During the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria in the 13th century, the Golden Horde conquered the realm. After a destruction of Bilyar during the Mongol invasion, the older capital became a centre of a separate province (or duchy) within the Golden Horde. It lay outside the &quot;ulus&quot; itself, but had direct Mongol presence. The Mongols eliminated the existing socio-political structure of the Volga Bolgars. During the period of Mongol domination Bolgar acquired immense wealth and many imposing buildings and grew tenfold in size. The taxation of regions such as Bolgar, Khwarizm, Crimea and Azerbaijan filled the Golden Horde&#x27;s coffers with great wealth, and the Mongols replaced the sitting rulers of Bolgar and Khwarizm with their own, while the Rus&#x27; principalities in the west brought them comparatively little revenue, and they left the local princes in Rus&#x27;, Armenia and Georgia in charge.

The late 14th century saw a marked decline in its fortunes. It was sacked by in 1361 during the Great Troubles. The Muscovite–Volga Bulgars war (1376) saw Muscovy and Nizhny Novgorod-Suzdal briefly capture Grand Bolgar and installing their own &quot;doroga&quot; and &quot;tamozhnia&quot; (customs collector), which probably were existing offices at the time, before the Tatars retook the city. It was endangered by Timur during the Tokhtamysh–Timur war. As a Muslim religious center Bolgar persevered until the mid-16th century when the Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the Russian Tsar Ivan IV and incorporated into the Russian state.

During Tsarist rule the site of the ancient town was settled by Russian commoners. Tsar Peter the Great issued a special ukase to preserve the surviving ruins, which was the first Russian law aimed at preserving historical heritage.

=== Little pilgrimage ===
During the Soviet period, Bolgar was a center of a local Islamic movement known as &quot;The Little Hajj&quot;; Muslims from Tatarstan and other parts of the Soviet Union could not participate in the hajj to Mecca, so they travelled instead to Bolgar.

== Monuments and temples ==

== Importance ==

The Tatars refer to the medieval capital of Volga Bolgaria as &quot;Shahri Bolghar&quot; (), that is Persian for &quot;the City of Bolghar&quot;. The town is part of their cultural heritage, because Volga Bulgaria is the predecessor state of the Khanate of Kazan, which in turn is in a way the predecessor of today&#x27;s Russian republic of Tatarstan.

Today, the capital of Tatarstan is Kazan, but many Tatars consider Bolghar to be their ancient and religious capital and to allow a glimpse of Muslim Bulgar life before the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria.

<text>Old Order Mennonites (Pennsylvania German: ) form a branch of the Mennonite tradition. Old Order are those Mennonite groups of Swiss German and south German heritage who practice a lifestyle without some elements of modern technology, still drive a horse and buggy rather than cars, wear very conservative and modest dress, and have retained the old forms of worship, baptism and communion.

All Old Order Mennonites reject certain technologies (e.g., radio, television, Internet), but the extent of this rejection depends on the individual group. Old Order groups generally place great emphasis on a disciplined community instead of the individual&#x27;s personal faith beliefs. The Pennsylvania German language is spoken vigorously among all horse-and-buggy groups except the Virginia Old Order Mennonites, who lost their original language before becoming Old Order. There is no overall church or conference to unite all the different groups of Old Order Mennonites. In 2008–2009, a minority of Old Order Mennonites accepted automobiles, whereas a majority retain horse and buggy transportation.

The total population of Old Order Mennonites can be estimated to be between 72,000 and 84,000 in 2021.

Very conservative Plautdietsch-speaking Russian Mennonites, who may have a similar belief and lifestyle, are normally not called Old Order Mennonite.

== Names ==
From the first Old Order division in Indiana in 1872 under bishop Jacob Wisler (1808–1889) until the middle of the 20th century, all Old Order Mennonites were called by many &quot;Wisler Mennonites,&quot; &quot;Old Order Mennonites, Wisler,&quot; even &quot;Wislerites,&quot; or the like. In a few cases this usage has persisted, but today the term &quot;Wisler Mennonites&quot; normally refers to a certain subgroup, the Ohio-Indiana Mennonite Conference. Old Order Mennonites who do not use automobiles are either referred to as &quot;horse and buggy Mennonites&quot; or &quot;team Mennonites&quot; (the word for them in Pennsylvania German is ). Sometimes the term &quot;Old Order Mennonites&quot; is restricted to groups that do not use cars. &quot;Automobile&quot; Old Order Mennonites refer to those who split from horse-and-buggy Old Order groups. It is common to name groups after a bishop, in most cases the leading bishop during the time of division.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
In the second half of the 19th century, the Old Order Movement emerged among Anabaptists of South German and Swiss origin in North America who spoke mostly Pennsylvania German. Most &quot;Old Order&quot; Mennonites emerged through divisions from the main body of Mennonites between 1872 and 1901 in four regions of North America: Indiana in 1872, Ontario in 1889, Pennsylvania in 1893 and Virginia in 1901. Conflicts over the introduction of such modern practices as Sunday Schools, revival meetings, and English-language preaching drove the formation of Old Order Mennonite churches. These modernizing trends that changed the form of religious practice were pushed among the Mennonites especially by two men: John F. Funk and John S. Coffman. The traditionally minded people left the old conferences to form new ones, but not the modernizers.

The Stauffer Mennonites had already split away in 1845 over several issues, favoring a stricter church practice. Today they, and groups that split from them, are the most traditional Old Order Mennonite groups concerning technologies and dress.

The Reformed Mennonites, formed in 1812, are a special group that does not totally fit into the &quot;Old Order&quot; group but that has best retained some old traditions, e. g. they wear the most traditional form of plain dress among all Mennonites. Concerns that led to the formation of the new group were &quot;the worldly drift of the church&quot; and &quot;degeneration&quot;.

According to a 2017 report,
&quot;there are two basic strains of Mennonites in Canada: the Swiss-South German Mennonites came via Pennsylvania, and the Dutch-North German Mennonites came via Russia (Ukraine). In the late 1700s and early 1800s &quot;Swiss&quot; Mennonites from Pennsylvania settled in southern Ontario. In the 1870s, a large group of &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites from Ukraine moved to southern Manitoba. Further waves of &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites came to Canada in the 1920s and 1940s&quot;. In the last 50 years, Mennonites have been coming to Canada from Mexico. The majority today are not of the Old Order.

=== 20th century ===
Between 1907 and 1931 another wave of church splits occurred among the Old Orders, concerning the use of new technologies, especially cars. The splits occurred in Indiana and Ohio in 1907, in Ontario in 1931, and in Pennsylvania in 1927, generally dividing them into the groups called horse and buggy and automobile.

Between the 1940s and the 1960s, both the Orthodox Mennonites and the Noah Hoover Mennonites emerged from a long series of splits and reunifications of people among the Old Orders who were not modernizers but sought a purer form of Mennonite life. Both the Orthodox Mennonites and the Noah Hoovers are &quot;intentionalist-minded, ultra-plain Old Order Mennonite&quot; groups. Stephen Scott writes about the Noah Hoover Mennonite:
== Beliefs and practices ==

Many practices among the Old Order Mennonites stem from the biblical principle of nonconformity to the world, according to and other Bible verses.

The avoidance of technologies by Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish is based not on a belief that the technology is in some way evil, but over a concern for the nature of their communities. Community is important to a Mennonite, and a technology or practice is rejected if it would adversely affect it. Many Old Order Mennonite groups reject automobiles but in an emergency even the most traditional Old Order Mennonite is likely to accept a ride in an automobile; those who sell milk in areas that require cooling will install electricity in the barn. Some of the groups that allow the use of cars and trucks, such as the Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference, will ensure that they are all black, even painting over chromed sections to achieve this effect.

Old Order Mennonites also practise &quot;plainness&quot;, including the dress, which is the opposite of showiness in clothing but also in physical appearance.

Many Amish and Old Order Mennonites do not use traditional health insurance with monthly premiums copayments. In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, some Amish and Mennonites use Preferred Health Care (PHC) Old Order Group coverage (OOG). When an OOG member visits a participating provider (approximately 1100 local physicians and 9 hospitals in the Lancaster area accept the OOG coverage), they present a unique white card with red and blue print identifying them as a PHC member. These cards are void of any identifying information, as is the custom of their religious belief. After care is rendered, providers submit a claim to PHC for a &quot;repricing&quot; as if the patient had insurance. A PHC statement is then sent to the medical practice and the patient indicating the discounted amount due the provider. The practice then collects the repriced amount from the patient directly, as per practice policy for collecting balances due on self-pay patient accounts. In this way, the Old Order Group has engaged in collective bargaining practices to lower their cost of health care. Additionally, the community will support any member who is sick, disadvantaged, old, or who has suffered an accident.

Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish groups are often grouped together in North America&#x27;s popular press. This is incorrect, according to a 2017 report by &quot;Canadian Mennonite&quot; magazine: The customs of Old Order Mennonites, the Amish communities and Old Colony Mennonites have a number of similarities, but the cultural differences are significant enough so that members of one group would not feel comfortable moving to another group. The Old Order Mennonites and Amish have the same European roots and the language spoken in their homes is the same German dialect. Old Colony Mennonites use Low German, a different German dialect.

Unlike most Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites have meeting houses for worship, typically of very simple design and lacking adornment. In many respects especially car driving Old Order Mennonite groups are quite similar to Conservative Mennonites but differ particularly in their non-acceptance of Sunday School and Revival Meetings, whereas horse and buggy Mennonites additionally retained use of the German language in everyday life and in their worship services.

The spectrum of Old Order Mennonite groups ranges from those that differ little from even conservative Old Order Amish groups like the Swartzentruber Amish to those that are barely different from Conservative Mennonite groups concerning the use of technologies.

What characterizes automobile groups as Old Order rather than Conservative Mennonite is their retention of traditional forms of worship, communion, baptism, funeral and leadership structures. By contrast, some wedding practices have changed. The Old Order Mennonites normally have neither Sunday Schools nor revival meetings.

Horse-and-buggy groups have retained a rural lifestyle, with farming as an important part of their economy. Most horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites allow the use of tractors for farming, although some groups insist on steel-wheeled tractors to prevent their being used for road transportation. Some traditional groups, like the Orthodox Mennonites and the Noah Hoover Mennonites, still till their fields with horses. The horse-and-buggy people stress separation from the world, excommunicate, and normally shun in a strict manner. All Old Order Mennonite groups meet in meeting houses or church buildings (when they have full-fledged congregations), contrary to the Old Order Amish, who meet in the homes or barns of their members.

Progressive (&quot;automobile&quot;) Old Order Mennonites, like the Weaverland Conference Mennonites (USA), Wisler Mennonites (USA), and Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference (Canada), largely evolved from the same series of Old Order schisms from 1872 to 1901. Nowadays, they often share the same meeting houses with and adhere to almost identical forms of Old Order worship as their horse-and-buggy Old Order brethren with whom they parted ways in the early 20th century. Although Weaverland Old Orders began using cars in 1927, the cars were required to be plain and painted black. The form of the ban among progressive groups in general is less severe, which means an ex-communicant is not always shunned and is, therefore, not excluded from the family table, shunned by their spouse and/or cut off from business dealings. All progressive Old Orders have either already shifted from Pennsylvania German to English or are in the process to do so. In recent decades, however, family sizes and growth rates of the progressive groups have diminished compared to the horse-and-buggy groups.

According to a University of Waterloo report of 2017, &quot;of the estimated 59,000 Mennonites in Ontario, only about twenty percent are members of conservative groups&quot;.

=== Controversy ===
In November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada, both the Region of Waterloo Public Health unit and Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health issued orders to close Old Order schools and places of worship in their regions and to limit social interactions. In Waterloo Region, the orders applied to sects &quot;including Markham, Old Colony, and David Martin Mennonite communities&quot;, according to a news report. Both agencies cited a lack of cooperation with public health requirements that were intended to minimize the spread of the virus. In an interview with the Waterloo Region Record, bishop Peter Brubacher, (bishop &quot;for seven Old Order Mennonite church districts&quot; in north Waterloo Region, according to another news agency), made this comment: &quot;I guess to be frank and honest, a lot of people really didn’t take it that serious, to isolate&quot;.

== Subgroups ==
The table below lists all groups with more than 250 members in 2008–2009 and in 2018-2019, if available.
In addition to the groups listed above there were also several smaller horse-and-buggy groups like the Joseph Brubaker group with 58 adult members, the William Weaver group with 55 adult members, the Aaron Martin group with 45 adult members, the Allen Martin group with 37 adult members, and the Wellesley Orthodox group with about 20 members (this information dates from 1995). Kraybill and Bowman in 2001 mention one more small group, the Harvey Nolt group, divided from the Wengers.

Because splits, mergers and even the dissolution of small groups are not uncommon among Old Order Mennonites, the situation today may look quite different.

== Population and distribution ==
Horse-and-buggy (or team) Old Order Mennonites can be found in the United States, Canada, and Belize. In the year 2000 more than 70 percent of the horse-and-buggy people lived in Pennsylvania and Ontario, where they emerged through divisions from the main body of Mennonites in the late 19th century and from the division between automobile and horse-and-buggy groups in the early 20th century. In Indiana, Ohio and Virginia they also emerged through divisions, but in much smaller numbers. Settlements of horse-and-buggy Mennonites in other states were created by migrations, that started mainly since the 1960s. There are also Old Order Mennonites in Belize (Cayo and Toledo Districts). The table on the right lists the total population of horse-and-buggy Mennonites per U.S. state, Canadian province or Belize in North America in the late 1990s and the 2015 number of Pennsylvania German speaking Mennonites that is almost identical with the number of horse-and-buggy Mennonites.

=== Adherents ===
According to C. Henry Smith, who wrote in 1908, all Old Order Mennonite groups counted &quot;hardly more than two thousand members&quot;. In 1957 the total number of members of all Old Order Mennonite groups was 5,800 members in 44 congregations. For the year 2001 Kraybill and Hostetter give the number 16,478 for the membership of &quot;all Old Order Mennonites groups&quot; in the USA. According to the Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia in 2002 there were approximately 17,000 baptized Old Order Mennonite members in the USA and 3,000 in Canada. There were more than 27,000 adult, baptized members of Old Order Mennonites in North America and Belize in 2008/9. The total population of Old Order Mennonites groups speaking Pennsylvania German was about 43,000 in 2015, which indicates that the total population of all Old Order Mennonites groups, including those who have lost the language or are in the process of losing it, was roughly between 60,000 and 70,000 in 2015. Under the condition that the annual growth is 3.7 percent, this would result in a total Old Order Mennonite population of about 72,000 to 84,000 in 2021.

=== Growth ===
The Wenger Mennonites, the largest horse-and-buggy group, have a growth rate of 3.7 percent a year, which is comparable to the growth rate of Old Order Amish. The Wengers have larger families and a higher retention rate than their car-driving brothers, the Horning Mennonites. In 2005, the average number of children per household was 8.25 among Old Order Mennonites in Indiana. In a sample of 199 people from the Martindale District of the Wenger Mennonites, born between 1953 and 1968, there was a retention rate of 95 percent in 1998.

== Similar groups ==
There are quite a lot of similarities between Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish, especially between the Amish and the horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites, who both speak Pennsylvania German and who have a shared tradition of plain dress. To a lesser extent there are similarities with conservative &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites, who live in Latin America, speak another German dialect, Plautdietsch, and who have their own tradition of plain dress. The same is true for the Hutterites, who speak Hutterisch and live in community of goods. There are also similarities with the different Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren groups and the Old Order River Brethren, who have some shared Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Old Order Mennonites.

== Publishing ==
The Old Order Mennonites find an affinity with the Old Order Amish publishing house called Pathway Publishers located in Lagrange, Indiana, and Aylmer, Ontario. More recently the Old Order Mennonites of Ontario have done some of their own publishing and a private enterprise known as Vineyard Publications has been formed near Wallenstein, Ontario. Members of the Old Order churches tend to use the Pennsylvania German dialect for literary expression more often than Old Order Amish. There are several authors of Pennsylvania German prose and poetry. Well-known, for example, is Isaac Horst (1918–2008) from Mount Forest (Ontario, Canada), who wrote the book &quot;Bei sich selwert un ungewehnlich&quot; (in English: &quot;Separate and Peculiar&quot;). Pennsylvania German texts are mostly published in the Pennsylvania German dialect newspaper &quot;Hiwwe wie Driwwe&quot;.

<text>On June 12, 1987, at the Brandenburg Gate, United States president Ronald Reagan delivered a speech commonly known by a key line from the middle part: &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot; Reagan called for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to open the Berlin Wall, which had encircled West Berlin since 1961.

The following day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried Reagan’s picture on the front page, below the title &quot;Reagan Calls on Gorbachev to Tear Down the Berlin Wall&quot;. Its impact on the Kremlin became widely known after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In the post-Cold War era, it was often seen as one of the most memorable performances of an American president in Berlin after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 speech &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;. Reagan&#x27;s speech was written by Peter Robinson.

==Background==
The &quot;tear down this wall&quot; speech was not the first time Reagan had addressed the issue of the Berlin Wall. In a visit to West Berlin in June 1982, he stated, &quot;I&#x27;d like to ask the Soviet leaders one question [...] Why is the wall there?&quot;. In 1986, 25 years after the construction of the wall, in response to West German newspaper &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot; asking when he thought the wall could be removed, Reagan said, &quot;I call upon those responsible to dismantle it [today]&quot;.

On the day before Reagan&#x27;s 1987 visit, 50,000 people had demonstrated against the presence of the American president in West Berlin. The city saw the largest police deployment in its history after World War II. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the U1 U-Bahn line was shut down). About those demonstrators, Reagan said at the end of his speech: &quot;I wonder if they ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek, no one would ever be able to do what they are doing again&quot;.
The speech drew controversy within the Reagan administration, with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. According to an account by Robinson, he traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense that the majority of West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall&#x27;s removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On Monday, May 18, 1987, Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, &quot;I thought it was a good, solid draft.&quot; White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;unpresidential&quot;, and Deputy U.S. National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, &quot;I think we&#x27;ll leave it in.&quot;

Chief speechwriter Anthony Dolan gives another account of the line&#x27;s origins, however, attributing it directly to Reagan. In an article published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in November 2009, Dolan gives a detailed account of how in an Oval Office meeting that was prior to Robinson&#x27;s draft Reagan came up with the line on his own. He records impressions of his own reaction and Robinson&#x27;s at the time. This led to a friendly exchange of letters between Robinson and Dolan over their differing accounts, which &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published.

== Speech ==

Arriving in Berlin on Friday, June 12, 1987, Reagan and his wife were taken to the Reichstag where they viewed the wall from a balcony. Reagan then gave his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00 p.m., in front of two panes of bulletproof glass shielding him from East Berlin. Among the spectators were West German president Richard von Weizsäcker, chancellor Helmut Kohl, and West Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen. In the speech, he said:

==Response and legacy==

The speech received &quot;relatively little coverage from the media&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin at the time of Reagan&#x27;s speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said &quot;[The speech] wasn&#x27;t really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down.&quot; East Germany&#x27;s communist rulers were not impressed, dismissing the speech as &quot;an absurd demonstration by a cold warrior&quot;, as later recalled by Politburo member Günter Schabowski. The Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an &quot;openly provocative, war-mongering speech.&quot;

Former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. &quot;He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe.&quot;

In an interview, Reagan claimed that the East German police did not allow people to come close to the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all.

Peter Robinson, the White House speech writer who drafted the address, said that the phrase &quot;tear down this wall&quot; was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin; in a conversation with Robinson, Elz remarked, &quot;If this man Gorbachev is serious with his talk of &quot;Glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; he can prove it by getting rid of this wall.&quot;

In a September 2012 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Liam Hoare pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.

Author James Mann disagreed with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan&#x27;s speech as having no real effect, and those who praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he put the speech in the context of previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to Gorbachev to work together to create &quot;the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down.&quot; Mann claimed that Reagan &quot;wasn&#x27;t trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [before Mann&#x27;s article] – he was helping to set the terms for the end of the cold war.&quot;

In November 2019, a bronze statue of Reagan was unveiled near the site of the speech.

<doc id="716963" wikidata="Q8041404" url="?curid=716963" title="X*Press X*Change">
<text>X*Press X*Change is an obsolete computer-based news-ticker-style newsfeed service that existed during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s. The X*Press service debuted in late 1986 as a low cost, publicly available newswire service that used personal computers to read and process the real-time data. X*PRESS Information Services, Ltd. was a partnership between McGraw-Hill and former cable television giant Tele-Communications, Inc. (purchased by AT&amp;T Corporation and later spun off). Data included delayed stock ticker quotes and news headlines from the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, McGraw-Hill, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, Reuters, and UPI. News from outside the U.S. was contributed by Kyodo, ITAR-TASS and Xinhua.

The X*Press service was transmitted by way of satellite. Specifically, the system&#x27;s data stream was carried on C-Band satellite onboard CNN&#x27;s (later WGN&#x27;s) transponder using General Instrument (now part of Motorola) InfoCipher 1500P satmodem technology. The InfoCipher modem was an add-on to VideoCipher II+/RS TVRO receivers and received the data at 9600 bits per second.

Participating cable companies could also send the data signal over their distribution systems to cable subscribers, who used a cable TV version of the InfoCipher modem and software on a home computer to decode and display the information stream. The software — called &quot;X*Press X*Change&quot; and &quot;X*Press Executive&quot; — was available for the Amiga, Apple Macintosh, Apple II, Atari ST, and MS-DOS platforms, although the Macintosh version was considered superior to the MS-DOS version. Sometime in the 1990s, the X*Press X*Change service was renamed InGenius, and faded into obscurity shortly afterward with the rise of the modern Internet as well as improved cable television on-screen graphics technology. The X*Change/InGenius service was discontinued in 1997.
==Data protocol and user-developed software==
X*PRESS kept the data stream protocol secret, revealing the specifications to certain software developers only under non-disclosure agreements.

Several users, unhappy with the limited capabilities of the PC software provided by X*PRESS or using computer systems for which X*PRESS did not provide any software, attempted to reverse-engineer the protocol of the data stream. This effort was helped by the fact that the Amiga version of &quot;X*Press X*Change&quot; was distributed on a floppy disk that had, by mistake, some random portions of the software source code on some of its unused blocks. The accidentally released source code provided some details and terminology used to describe the protocol, and other parts were purely reverse-engineered. It was never completely clear whether it was legal to publish or use the various forms of underground software that circulated among a small community of users.

<doc id="716964" wikidata="Q17663433" url="?curid=716964" title="Foxton Inclined Plane">
<text>The Foxton Inclined Plane is a canal inclined plane on the Leicester line of the Grand Union Canal about west of the Leicestershire town of Market Harborough, named after the nearby village of Foxton. 

The plane was built in 1900 as a solution to various operational restrictions imposed by the Foxton Lock flight. However, it was not a commercial success and only remained in full-time operation for ten years. The plane was dismantled in 1926. A project to re-create the plane commenced in the 2000s because the narrowbeam locks remain a bottleneck for leisure boat traffic.

==History==
By 1897, the Grand Junction Canal Company had acquired several of the canals comprising the Leicester line, and was keen to meet demand from carriers seeking to use wider beam (14 ft) craft, rather than the traditional narrow beam boats, which were the only type the locks could accommodate. 

Their solution was to build an inclined plane to the side of the locks. Initially, the company had planned for the plane to replace the locks, rather than having it act as a second, faster option. Construction began in 1898 and was finished by 10 July 1900.

The plane was designed by Gordon Cale Thomas, after a large-scale prototype was built at the company&#x27;s Bulbourne yard and he had assessed the climb. It had two tanks, or caissons, each capable of holding two narrowboats or a barge. The water-holding caissons balanced each other. The caissons&#x27; vertical guillotine gates created a watertight seal. The lift was powered by a 25-horsepower (19 kW) stationary steam engine. The land for the plane was purchased for £1,595 and total expenses for the project came to £39,244 by 24 June 1900.

The inclined plane had a journey time of 12 minutes for two boats up and two down, compared with 1¼ hours through the lock system, thereby improving the speed of passage up the hill tremendously. During a 12-hour day, 6,000 tons (6,100 tonnes) of cargo could pass between the upper and lower level. Unlike the locks, where water flowed downhill every time a boat passed through, on the inclined plane almost the same amount of water goes up and down the hill. Only the displaced water is moved, thus saving a great deal of water and giving better control of this vital resource.

An initial problem with the plane was the stress placed on the tracks by the caissons. There was a plan to build a similar inclined plane at the Watford Locks at the southern end of the canal&#x27;s summit level. However, this was never carried through (perhaps due to the low levels of traffic in the plane&#x27;s first two years), and as the Watford Locks were never widened, the economic benefits of the plane could not be fully realised. The need to continually maintain a supply of steam for the plane&#x27;s engine – in expectation of traffic – also proved to be a drain on finances. Thus, despite its obvious effectiveness, the Foxton Inclined Plane was mothballed in 1911 to save money. After that date it saw occasional use when the locks were undergoing maintenance.

In 1926, dismantling of the incline&#x27;s machinery began, and it was sold for scrap in 1928 for a mere £250. That year the chimney on the engine house was demolished and its bricks used for various canal repairs. The mooring bollards from the incline can be found alongside the locks.

== Preservation==
The Foxton Canal Museum is located in the former boiler house for the plane&#x27;s steam engine. The museum covers the history of the locks and the plane, the lives of the canal workers, and other aspects of the local canal. There is also a collection of Measham pottery. The museum opened in 1989 and is accredited by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council.

===Restoration===
The site of the Foxton Inclined Plane Boat Lift has been recognised as a scheduled monument and was on the Monuments at Risk Register. This recognition, together with the steady increase in leisure boating on British canals, means its restoration is now considered a key project in the development of the national waterway network. The cost of full restoration has been estimated at £9 million (in 2006).

Stage 1 of the project – the clearing of the site and restoration of the canal arms above and below the plane – was completed in 2008. A grant for £1.7 million was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the £2.8 million cost of this first stage, and its successful completion resulted in the site being removed from the Monuments at Risk register.

<text>Shlisselburg (, ; ; ; ), formerly Oreshek (Орешек) (1323–1611) and Petrokrepost (Петрокрепость) (1944–1992), is a town in Kirovsky District, Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located at the head of the Neva River on Lake Ladoga, east of St. Petersburg. Population: 

The Shlisselburg Fortress and the town center are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==History==

===Fortress===

The city was founded in 1323 with a wooden fortress named Oreshek (), which was built by Prince Yury of Moscow (in his capacity as Prince of Novgorod) on behalf of the Novgorod Republic in 1323.

After a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed at Oreshek on August 12, 1323, between Sweden and Grand Prince Yury and the Novgorod Republic.

In 1348, King Magnus Eriksson attacked and briefly took the fortress during his crusade in the region from 1348 to c. 1351. It was largely ruined by the time the Novgorodians retook the fortress in 1351.

In 1478, the Novgorod Republic was absorbed by the Muscovy who immediately started to strengthen their border with Sweden. The existing small citadel was demolished and a new stone fortress with seven towers was constructed, which occupied almost the entirety of Orekhovy Island.

In 1554–1555, during the Russo-Swedish war, the Swedes laid siege to the fortress, with no success. In response, Muscovites besieged Vyborg, with no success either.

During the Livonian war, in 1582, Swedish troops led by Pontus De La Gardie almost captured the fortress. After a row of artillery fire they managed to break into one of the towers, but were later repelled by Muscovites.

The fort was captured by Sweden in 1611 during the Ingrian War after nine months of siege, when the defenders lost every nine out of ten men. During the Ingrian Campaign of tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in June 1656 the fortress came under a siege by voevoda Potyomkin which lasted until November 1656 with no success.

In 1702, during the Great Northern War, the fortress was taken by Russians under Peter the Great in an amphibious assault: 440 Swedish soldiers defended the fort for ten days before surrendering. (See Siege of Nöteborg (1702)).

Peter renamed the fortress to Shlisselburg, a transliteration into the Cyrillic alphabet of Schlüsselburg. The name, meaning &quot;Key-fortress&quot; in German, which refers to Peter&#x27;s perception of the fortress as the &quot;key to Ingria&quot;.

During the Imperial period the fortress lost its military role and was used as a notorious political prison. Immediately after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the prisoners, both political and criminal, were released, and set the prison on fire.

Shortly before Shlisselburg was occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941), a garrison of 350 Red Army soldiers was sent to the fortress on Orekhovets island to bring supplies and munitions to the frontline. The garrison held the abandoned castle for 500 days preventing the Germans from landing there and cutting the last transit route from Leningrad to the mainland. Heavy artillery fire by the Germans destroyed all the buildings inside the fortress and part of the outer towers and walls, but despite numerous attempts the fortress was not captured. During Operation Iskra (18 January 1943) the siege of the fortress was lifted.

The war completely devastated the fortress. Of the original ten towers, the fortress retains only six (five Russian and one Swedish). Renovation of the walls and towers has been slow, although it is still underway. A stone monument in memory of the first Russo-Swedish peace treaty (1323) has been placed inside the fortress.

Tourists can reach the island from May to October via Shlisselburg or from the Northern bank of Neva, via Petrokrepost railway station with regular ferries that run every 10–15 minutes.

===Town===
A predecessor of the town was a posad that first appeared around the citadel on the island and in the late 15th–early 16th century shifted to both banks of the Neva. Once Muscovites rebuilt the old citadel into a powerful stronghold leaving no place for residential purposes, residents and merchants were only allowed to the island to seek shelter from advancing Swedish troops. A posad on the southern bank was more convenient for its population, unlike for those living on the northern coast, it was easier to flee the enemies to the southeast, into the Russian mainland. The southern posad of Oreshek was turned into a town in 1702 by Peter the Great.

In the course of Peter&#x27;s administrative reform, Shlisselburg was included in Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it became a part of Sankt-Petersburgsky Uyezd, and in 1755 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was established. In 1914, Sankt-Peterburgsky Uyezd was renamed Petrogradsky Uyezd.

The Old Ladoga Channel that divides the town into two parts was constructed from 1719 to 1731 to ensure the safety of the vessel traffic along the southern coast of the dangerously turbulent Lake Ladoga. The plan of the channel was worked out by Emperor Peter I himself. In 1826 the channel became too shallow, so numerous locks, including those in the town, were built to maintain the depth of the channel. In 1861 construction of the new channel was begun, which runs between the old one and the lake. The old channel was finally abandoned in 1940, and what remains of it may still be seen in Shlisselburg.

One of the most notorious political prisoners of Shlisselburg fortress was Iustin Zhuk (1887–1919), anarcho-syndicalist rebel from the Kiev Governorate. During the Russian Revolution he was released from prison and found a job on the gunpowder works of Shlisselburg, where he joined and then headed a commune of pro-Bolshevik workers. Zhuk supported the revolutionary forces in Petrograd and arranged day care for the children of workers as well as sourced food from Ukraine, where he was born. He led a group of Red Guards from Shlisselburg that were dispatched to the Russian-Finnish borderland to halt an intrusion of White Finns towards Petrograd and died in an ambush near Gruzino railway station in 1919. One of the streets in downtown Shlisselburg is named in memory of Zhuk.

On February 14, 1923, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January 1924, the uyezd was renamed Leningradsky. St. Petersburg Governorate was twice renamed, first Petrograd Governorate and subsequently Leningrad Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished. Shlisselburg was made a town of okrug significance and belonged to Leningrad Okrug. On August 19, 1930, Leningradsky Prigorodny District, with the administrative center in Leningrad, was established. On August 19, 1936, the district was abolished and Shlisselburg became the town of oblast significance.

During the Great Patriotic War Shlisselburg was swiftly occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941) that aimed to encircle Leningrad. On 18 January 1943 in the course of Operation Iskra Shlisselburg was retaken by the Red Army. As the railway connection to Leningrad via German-occupied Mga was still unavailable, two temporary railway passages over Neva were rapidly built in Shlisselburg, a temporary railway line over the ice, and shortly afterwards a wooden pile bridge. First train with supplies that went through Shlisselburg arrived in Leningrad on 7 February 1943.

In 1944, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Petrokrepost (lit. &#x27;Peter&#x27;s fortress&#x27;). Shlisselburg regained its former name in 1992.

In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Shlisselburg became a town of district significance, subordinated to Kirovsky District.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated within Kirovsky District as Shlisselburgskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Shlisselburgskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kirovsky Municipal District as Shlisselburgskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==

===Industry===
There are several shipyards in Shlisselburg.

The main company operating in the city is Nevsky shipyard, which was founded in 1913 when the ship repair workshops were established. The main activities of the company are shipbuilding, ship repair, modernization and renovation and machine-building.

===Transportation===
The railway platform of Petrokrepost, which has passenger service to Ladozhsky railway station in St. Petersburg, is located on the other bank of the Neva opposite of Shlisselburg.

The A120 road, which encircles St. Petersburg, and the M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, pass several kilometers south of the town.

The Neva and Lake Ladoga are navigable. In the beginning of the 19th century, a system of canals bypassing Lake Ladoga was built, which at the time was a part of Mariinsky Water System, connecting the Neva with the Volga River. In particular, the New Ladoga Canal connects the Volkhov and the Neva Rivers. It replaced the Old Ladoga Canal built by Peter the Great, which thus became disused and decayed. The canals collectively are known as the Ladoga Canal. The canals originate from the Neva in Shlisselburg.

==Architecture==
The town does not retain many historical buildings, apart from a handful of 18th-century churches. Perhaps the most remarkable landmark is the Old Ladoga Canal, started at the behest of Peter the Great in 1719, and completed under the guidance of Fieldmarshal Munnich twelve years later. The canal stretches for ; its granite sluices date from 1836.

<text>Rational pricing is the assumption in financial economics that asset prices – and hence asset pricing models – will reflect the arbitrage-free price of the asset as any deviation from this price will be &quot;arbitraged away&quot;. This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.

==Arbitrage mechanics==
Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a state of imbalance between two (or possibly more) markets. Where this mismatch can be exploited (i.e. after transaction costs, storage costs, transport costs, dividends etc.) the arbitrageur can &quot;lock in&quot; a risk-free profit by purchasing and selling simultaneously in both markets.

In general, arbitrage ensures that &quot;the law of one price&quot; will hold; arbitrage also equalises the prices of assets with identical cash flows, and sets the price of assets with known future cash flows.

===The law of one price===
The same asset must trade at the same price on all markets (&quot;the law of one price&quot;).
Where this is not true, the arbitrageur will:
# buy the asset on the market where it has the lower price, and simultaneously sell it (short) on the second market at the higher price
# deliver the asset to the buyer and receive that higher price
# pay the seller on the cheaper market with the proceeds and pocket the difference.

===Assets with identical cash flows===
Two assets with identical cash flows must trade at the same price. Where this is not true, the arbitrageur will:
# sell the asset with the higher price (short sell) and simultaneously buy the asset with the lower price
# fund his purchase of the cheaper asset with the proceeds from the sale of the expensive asset and pocket the difference
# deliver on his obligations to the buyer of the expensive asset, using the cash flows from the cheaper asset.

===An asset with a known future-price===
An asset with a known price in the future must today trade at that price discounted at the risk free rate.

Note that this condition can be viewed as an application of the above, where the two assets in question are the asset to be delivered and the risk free asset.

(a) where the discounted future price is &quot;higher&quot; than today&#x27;s price:
# The arbitrageur agrees to deliver the asset on the future date (i.e. sells forward) and simultaneously buys it today with borrowed money.
# On the delivery date, the arbitrageur hands over the underlying, and receives the agreed price.
# He then repays the lender the borrowed amount plus interest.
# The difference between the agreed price and the amount repaid (i.e. owed) is the arbitrage profit.

(b) where the discounted future price is &quot;lower&quot; than today&#x27;s price:
# The arbitrageur agrees to pay for the asset on the future date (i.e. buys forward) and simultaneously sells (short) the underlying today; he invests (or banks) the proceeds.
# On the delivery date, he cashes in the matured investment, which has appreciated at the risk free rate.
# He then takes delivery of the underlying and pays the agreed price using the matured investment.
# The difference between the maturity value and the agreed price is the arbitrage profit.

Point (b) is only possible for those holding the asset but not needing it until the future date. There may be few such parties if short-term demand exceeds supply, leading to backwardation.

==Fixed income securities==
:&quot;See also Fixed income arbitrage; Bond credit rating.&quot;

Rational pricing is one approach used in pricing fixed rate bonds. 
Here, each cash flow on the bond can be matched by trading in either 
(a) some multiple of a zero-coupon bond, ZCB, corresponding to each coupon date, and of equivalent credit worthiness (if possible, from the same issuer as the bond being valued) with the corresponding maturity, 
or (b) in a strip corresponding to each coupon, and a ZCB for the return of principle on maturity. 
Then, given that the cash flows can be replicated, the price of the bond must today equal the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the same rate as each ZCB (per ). 
Were this not the case, arbitrage would be possible and would bring the price back into line with the price based on ZCBs. The mechanics are as follows.

Where the price of the bond is misaligned with the present value of the ZCBs, the arbitrageur could:
# finance her purchase of whichever of the bond or the sum of the ZCBs was cheaper
# by short selling the other
# and meeting her cash flow commitments using the coupons or maturing zeroes as appropriate
# then, her profit would be the difference between the two values.

The pricing formula is then formula_1, where each cash flow formula_2 is discounted at the rate formula_3 that matches the coupon date. 
Often, the formula is expressed as formula_4, using prices instead of rates, as prices are more readily available.

===Yield curve modeling===
Per the logic outlined, rational pricing applies also to interest rate modeling more generally. 
Here, &quot;yield curves&quot; in entirety must be arbitrage-free with respect to the prices of individual instruments. 
Were this not the case, the ZCBs implied by the curve would result in quoted bond-prices, e.g., differing from those observed in the market, presenting an arbitrage opportunity. 
Investment banks, and other market makers here, thus invest considerable resources in &quot;curve stripping&quot;.
See Bootstrapping (finance) and Multi-curve framework for the methods employed, and Model risk for further discussion.

==Pricing derivatives==
A derivative is an instrument that allows for buying and selling of the same asset on two markets – the spot market and the derivatives market. Mathematical finance assumes that any imbalance between the two markets will be arbitraged away. Thus, in a correctly priced derivative contract, the derivative price, the strike price (or reference rate), and the spot price will be related such that arbitrage is not possible. See Fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing.

===Futures===
In a futures contract, for no arbitrage to be possible, the price paid on delivery (the forward price) must be the same as the cost (including interest) of buying and storing the asset. In other words, the rational forward price represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk free rate (the &quot;asset with a known future-price&quot;, as above); see Spot–future parity. Thus, for a simple, non-dividend paying asset, the value of the future/forward, formula_5, will be found by accumulating the present value formula_6 at time formula_7 to maturity formula_8 by the rate of risk-free return formula_9.

:formula_10

This relationship may be modified for storage costs, dividends, dividend yields, and convenience yields; see futures contract pricing.

Any deviation from this equality allows for arbitrage as follows.

* In the case where the forward price is &quot;higher&quot;:
# The arbitrageur sells the futures contract and buys the underlying today (on the spot market) with borrowed money.
# On the delivery date, the arbitrageur hands over the underlying, and receives the agreed forward price.
# He then repays the lender the borrowed amount plus interest.
# The difference between the two amounts is the arbitrage profit.

* In the case where the forward price is &quot;lower&quot;:
# The arbitrageur buys the futures contract and sells the underlying today (on the spot market); he invests the proceeds.
# On the delivery date, he cashes in the matured investment, which has appreciated at the risk free rate.
# He then receives the underlying and pays the agreed forward price using the matured investment. [If he was short the underlying, he returns it now.]
# The difference between the two amounts is the arbitrage profit.

===Swaps===
Rational pricing underpins the logic of swap valuation. Here, two counterparties &quot;swap&quot; obligations, effectively exchanging cash flow streams calculated against a notional principal amount, and the value of the swap is the present value (PV) of both sets of future cash flows &quot;netted off&quot; against each other. 

To be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the &quot;Net&quot; present value of these future cash flows is equal to zero; see . Once traded, swaps can (must) also be priced using rational pricing. 

The examples below are for interest rate swaps and are representative of pure rational pricing as these exclude credit risk although the principle applies to any type of swap.
====Valuation at initiation====
Consider a fixed-to-floating Interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate (&quot;Swap rate&quot;), and Party B pays a floating rate. Here, the &quot;fixed rate&quot; would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A is equal to the present value of the &quot;expected&quot; future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Were this not the case, an arbitrageur, C, could:
# Assume the position with the &quot;lower&quot; present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value
# Meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments—which have a higher present value
# Use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds
# Pocket the difference – where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit

====Subsequent valuation====
The Floating leg of an interest rate swap can be &quot;decomposed&quot; into a series of forward rate agreements. Here, since the swap has identical payments to the FRA, arbitrage free pricing must apply as above – i.e. the value of this leg is equal to the value of the corresponding FRAs. Similarly, the &quot;receive-fixed&quot; leg of a swap can be valued by comparison to a bond with the same schedule of payments. (Relatedly, given that their underlyings have the same cash flows, bond options and swaptions are equatable.) See further under .

===Options===
As above, where the value of an asset in the future is known (or expected), this value can be used to determine the asset&#x27;s rational price today. In an option contract, however, exercise is dependent on the price of the underlying, and hence payment is uncertain. Option pricing models therefore include logic that either &quot;locks in&quot; or &quot;infers&quot; this future value; both approaches deliver identical results. Methods that lock-in future cash flows assume &quot;arbitrage free pricing&quot;, and those that infer expected value assume &quot;risk neutral valuation&quot;.

To do this, (in their simplest, though widely used form) both approaches assume a &quot;binomial model&quot; for the behavior of the underlying instrument, which allows for only two states – up or down. If S is the current price, then in the next period the price will either be &quot;S up&quot; or &quot;S down&quot;. Here, the value of the share in the up-state is S × u, and in the down-state is S × d (where u and d are multipliers with d &lt; 1 &lt; u and assuming d &lt; 1+r &lt; u; see the binomial options model). Then, given these two states, the &quot;arbitrage free&quot; approach creates a position that has an identical value in either state – the cash flow in one period is therefore known, and arbitrage pricing is applicable. The risk neutral approach infers expected option value from the intrinsic values at the later two nodes.

Although this logic appears far removed from the Black–Scholes formula and the lattice approach in the Binomial options model, it in fact underlies both models; see The Black–Scholes PDE. The assumption of binomial behaviour in the underlying price is defensible as the number of time steps between today (valuation) and exercise increases, and the period per time-step is correspondingly short. The Binomial options model allows for a high number of very short time-steps (if coded correctly), while Black–Scholes, in fact, models a continuous process.

The examples below have shares as the underlying, but may be generalised to other instruments. The value of a put option can be derived as below, or may be found from the value of the call using put–call parity.

====Arbitrage free pricing====
Here, the future payoff is &quot;locked in&quot; using either &quot;delta hedging&quot; or the &quot;replicating portfolio&quot; approach. As above, this payoff is then discounted, and the result is used in the valuation of the option today.

=====Delta hedging=====
It is possible to create a position consisting of Δ shares and 1 call sold, such that the position&#x27;s value will be identical in the &quot;S up&quot; and &quot;S down&quot; states, and hence known with certainty (see Delta hedging). This certain value corresponds to the forward price above (&quot;An asset with a known future price&quot;), and as above, for no arbitrage to be possible, the present value of the position must be its expected future value discounted at the risk free rate, r. The value of a call is then found by equating the two.

# Solve for Δ such that:
#: value of position in one period = Δ × &quot;S up&quot; - formula_11 (&quot;S up&quot; – strike price, 0) = Δ × &quot;S down&quot; - formula_11 (&quot;S down&quot; – strike price, 0)
# Solve for the value of the call, using Δ, where:
#: value of position today = value of position in one period ÷ (1 + r) = Δ × &quot;S current&quot; – value of call

=====The replicating portfolio=====

It is possible to create a position consisting of Δ shares and $B borrowed at the risk free rate, which will produce identical cash flows to one option on the underlying share. The position created is known as a &quot;replicating portfolio&quot; since its cash flows replicate those of the option. As shown above (&quot;Assets with identical cash flows&quot;), in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, since the cash flows produced are identical, the price of the option today must be the same as the value of the position today.

# Solve simultaneously for Δ and B such that:
#* Δ × &quot;S up&quot; - B × (1 + r) = formula_13 (0, &quot;S up&quot; – strike price)
#* Δ × &quot;S down&quot; - B × (1 + r) = formula_13 (0, &quot;S down&quot; – strike price)
# Solve for the value of the call, using Δ and B, where:
#* call = Δ × &quot;S current&quot; - B

Note that there is no discounting here the interest rate appears only as part of the construction. This approach is therefore used in preference to others where it is not clear whether the risk free rate may be applied as the discount rate at each decision point, or whether, instead, a premium over risk free, differing by state, would be required. The best example of this would be under real options analysis where managements&#x27; actions actually change the risk characteristics of the project in question, and hence the Required rate of return could differ in the up- and down-states. Here, in the above formulae, we then have: &quot;Δ × &quot;S up&quot; - B × (1 + r up)...&quot; and &quot;Δ × &quot;S down&quot; - B × (1 + r down)...&quot;. See . (Another case where the modelling assumptions may depart from rational pricing is the valuation of employee stock options.)

====Risk neutral valuation====
Here the value of the option is calculated using the risk neutrality assumption. Under this assumption, the &quot;expected value&quot; (as opposed to &quot;locked in&quot; value) is discounted. The expected value is calculated using the intrinsic values from the later two nodes: &quot;Option up&quot; and &quot;Option down&quot;, with u and d as price multipliers as above. These are then weighted by their respective probabilities: &quot;probability&quot; p of an up move in the underlying, and &quot;probability&quot; (1-p) of a down move. The expected value is then discounted at r, the risk-free rate.

# Solve for p
#: under risk-neutrality, for no arbitrage to be possible in the share, today&#x27;s price must represent its expected value discounted at the risk free rate (i.e., the share price is a Martingale):
#:formula_15
# Solve for call value, using p
#: for no arbitrage to be possible in the call, today&#x27;s price must represent its expected value discounted at the risk free rate:

Note that above, the risk neutral formula does not refer to the expected or forecast return of the underlying, nor its volatility p as solved, relates to the risk-neutral measure as opposed to the actual probability distribution of prices. Nevertheless, both arbitrage free pricing and risk neutral valuation deliver identical results. In fact, it can be shown that &quot;delta hedging&quot; and &quot;risk-neutral valuation&quot; use identical formulae expressed differently. Given this equivalence, it is valid to assume &quot;risk neutrality&quot; when pricing derivatives. A more formal relationship is described via the fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing.

==Pricing shares==
The arbitrage pricing theory (APT), a general theory of asset pricing, has become influential in the pricing of shares. APT holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modelled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, where sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor specific beta coefficient:

:formula_17

:where
:* formula_18 is the risky asset&#x27;s expected return,
:* formula_19 is the risk free rate,
:* formula_20 is the macroeconomic factor,
:* formula_21 is the sensitivity of the asset to factor formula_22,
:* and formula_23 is the risky asset&#x27;s idiosyncratic random shock with mean zero.

The model derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly – the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by model. If the price diverges, arbitrage should bring it back into line. Here, to perform the arbitrage, the investor &quot;creates&quot; a correctly priced asset (a &quot;synthetic&quot; asset), a &quot;portfolio&quot; with the same net-exposure to each of the macroeconomic factors as the mispriced asset but a different expected return. See the arbitrage pricing theory article for detail on the construction of the portfolio. The arbitrageur is then in a position to make a risk free profit as follows:

* Where the asset price is too low, the &quot;portfolio&quot; should have appreciated at the rate implied by the APT, whereas the mispriced asset would have appreciated at &quot;more&quot; than this rate. The arbitrageur could therefore:
# Today: short sell the &quot;portfolio&quot; and buy the mispriced-asset with the proceeds.
# At the end of the period: sell the mispriced asset, use the proceeds to buy back the &quot;portfolio&quot;, and pocket the difference.

* Where the asset price is too high, the &quot;portfolio&quot; should have appreciated at the rate implied by the APT, whereas the mispriced asset would have appreciated at &quot;less&quot; than this rate. The arbitrageur could therefore:
# Today: short sell the mispriced-asset and buy the &quot;portfolio&quot; with the proceeds.
# At the end of the period: sell the &quot;portfolio&quot;, use the proceeds to buy back the mispriced-asset, and pocket the difference.

Note that under &quot;true arbitrage&quot;, the investor locks-in a &quot;guaranteed&quot; payoff, whereas under APT arbitrage, the investor locks-in a positive &quot;expected&quot; payoff. The APT thus assumes &quot;arbitrage in expectations&quot; – i.e. that arbitrage by investors will bring asset prices back into line with the returns expected by the model.

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an earlier, (more) influential theory on asset pricing. Although based on different assumptions, the CAPM can, in some ways, be considered a &quot;special case&quot; of the APT; specifically, the CAPM&#x27;s security market line represents a single-factor model of the asset price, where beta is exposure to changes in the &quot;value of the market&quot; as a whole.

==No-arbitrage pricing under systemic risk==
Classical valuation methods like the Black–Scholes model or the Merton model cannot account for systemic counterparty risk which is present in systems with financial interconnectedness.

<doc id="716973" wikidata="Q4490179" url="?curid=716973" title="Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk">
<text>Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, 3rd Marquess of Dorset (17 January 151723 February 1554), was an English courtier and nobleman of the Tudor period. He was the father of Lady Jane Grey, known as &quot;the Nine Days Queen&quot;.

==Origins==

He was born on 17 January 1517 at Westminster, London, and was the son and heir of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset (1477–1530) by his wife Margaret Wotton (1485–1541), daughter of Sir Robert Wotton (c. 1463–1524) of Boughton Malherbe in Kent. Through his father, he was a great-grandson of Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of King Edward IV, by her first marriage to Sir John Grey of Groby.

==Marriage and progeny==
Before 1530, Grey was betrothed to Catherine FitzAlan, the daughter of William FitzAlan, 18th Earl of Arundel, whom he later refused to marry.

In 1533, with the permission of King Henry VIII, he married his half-second cousin Lady Frances Brandon (1517–1559), the daughter of King Henry&#x27;s sister Mary and Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. They had three daughters all second cousins to him as well as daughters: 
*Lady Jane Grey (1537–1554) 
*Lady Katherine Grey (1540–1568)
*Lady Mary Grey (1545–1578)

==Career==
===Henry VIII&#x27;s reign===
Henry Grey became the 3rd Marquess of Dorset in 1530 following the death of his father. Before Henry VIII&#x27;s death in 1547, Grey became a fixture in court circles. A knight of the Bath, he was the king&#x27;s sword-bearer at Anne Boleyn&#x27;s coronation in 1533, at Anne of Cleves&#x27; arrival in 1540, and at the capture of Boulogne in 1545. Twice he bore the Cap of Maintenance in parliament. He helped lead the army in France in 1545. In 1547, he became a Knight of the Order of the Garter.

===Edward VI&#x27;s reign===
After Henry VIII&#x27;s death in 1547, Grey fell out of favour with the leader of King Edward VI&#x27;s government, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector of England. Returning to his home in Bradgate, Leicestershire, Grey concentrated on raising his family to greater heights. Thus, with the Protector&#x27;s brother Thomas, Lord Seymour, Grey conspired to have his daughter Jane married to the King. This plot failed, ending in Seymour&#x27;s execution, but Grey emerged unscathed.

In 1549, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, overthrew the Protectorship and secured power by appointing loyal friends to the Privy Council. Grey joined the Council as a part of this group. In July 1551, his wife&#x27;s youngest half-brother, Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, died without a male heir and the dukedom of Suffolk became extinct. Henry Grey was created Duke of Suffolk on 4 or 11 October 1551 at Hampton Court, in the same ceremony that elevated John Dudley to the Dukedom of Northumberland.

==Protestantism==
Henry Grey was best known for his zeal for the Protestant faith. The Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger dedicated a book to him in 1551 and frequently corresponded with the family. In Parliament and on the Privy Council, Grey pushed for further Protestant reforms. He is credited with making Leicestershire one of the most reliably Protestant counties in early modern England.

==Queen Jane==
Seriously ill, and fearing his own death, King Edward VI granted Northumberland&#x27;s request for the marriage of Suffolk&#x27;s daughter Lady Jane Grey to Northumberland&#x27;s son, Lord Guildford Dudley, on 25 May 1553. Edward later altered his will to make Jane his designated successor. Edward died on 6 July 1553, and three days later Suffolk, Northumberland, and other members of the Privy Council proclaimed Jane queen.

This proclamation failed; not by a large-scale rallying of forces in the country to Henry VIII&#x27;s eldest daughter, the future Queen Mary I, as is often thought, but by a wavering Privy Council switching its allegiance to Mary during Northumberland&#x27;s absence on the campaign against her. The decision was led by Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, Suffolk&#x27;s brother-in-law, and William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Arundel had been imprisoned earlier by Northumberland for having sided with the previous Protector, Somerset; but it is not clear why Pembroke revolted, especially since his son and heir, Henry Herbert, married Henry Grey&#x27;s other daughter, Katherine, the same day as Jane&#x27;s wedding. The country was divided in its loyalties to the two contenders for Queen at the time.

By his wife&#x27;s friendship with the new Queen Mary, Grey and his daughter and son-in-law temporarily avoided execution. However, Mary had Henry Grey beheaded on 23 February 1554 at around nine to ten o&#x27;clock in the morning on Tower Hill, after his conviction for high treason for his part in Sir Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s attempt (JanuaryFebruary 1554) to overthrow her after she announced her intention to marry King Philip II of Spain. Eleven days earlier, on 12 February, his daughter Jane and his son-in-law, Guildford, had been executed.

==Mummified head==

According to Walter George Bell (writing in 1920), in 1851 the severed head of the Duke of Suffolk was discovered in a vault in the Church of Holy Trinity, Minories, in the City of London, suggested to have been preserved by the tannin-rich oak sawdust used to pad the basket on the scaffold on which he had been beheaded 297 years earlier. Bell believed the head might have been hidden by the Duke&#x27;s widow to prevent it from being exposed on a spike on London Bridge. Both of them had worshipped in the chapel at Holy Trinity. The church was closed in 1899 and deconsecrated, when the head found a new resting place at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Aldgate, to which Holy Trinity Parish had been annexed.

The head was examined in the late 19th century by Sir George Scharf, former Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, who noted a strong resemblance between its features and those in the portrait of the duke then in the possession of the Marquess of Salisbury at Hatfield House. However, Bell also notes a scandal at Holy Trinity in 1786 in which a sexton had been found sawing and chopping up coffins in the vaults and using the wood to stoke the fire in his quarters. Many of the bodies had been partly dismembered in the process, and Bell warned his readers that the surviving head might well have resulted from this debacle.

In later years, the head was sealed in a vault in the crypt at St Botolph&#x27;s, until a planned conversion of the space into an office resulted in an archaeological investigation of the site between April and July 1990. The archaeologists recovered the head from the vault and the Rector of the church buried it in the churchyard.

<doc id="716974" wikidata="Q973323" url="?curid=716974" title="Menindee, New South Wales">
<text>Menindee (derived from Minandichi, the original Indigenous name for Lake Menindee, and frequently but erroneously spelled &quot;Menindie&quot;) is a small town in the far west of New South Wales, Australia, in Central Darling Shire, on the banks of the Darling River, with a sign-posted population of 980 and a population of 537. Menindee was the first town to be established on the Darling River. There are two distinct theories for the derivation of the township’s name: (a) from the Barkindji word &quot;minandichi&quot; for the shallow ephemeral lake north-west of the present-day township; (b) from the Barkindji word &#x27;milhthaka&#x27;, meaning &quot;yolk of an egg&quot;.

==History==

===Aboriginal occupation===
The Menindee district lies within the traditional lands of the Barkindji people, who occupied the area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, with evidence of previous Aboriginal activities going back 35,000 years. Aboriginal people became increasingly concentrated along the Darling River as the nearby Willandra Lakes system began to dry out after the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The area around present-day Menindee was a particularly productive region for Aboriginal occupation with its overflow lakes and channels in combination with the riverine environment.

===European exploration===
The first Europeans into the region was an exploring party led by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1835. The expedition had travelled down the Bogan and Darling rivers, intending to follow the course of the Darling to its junction with the Murray. Mitchell and his men encountered bouts of hostility from aboriginal groups as they progressed. In the area of the Menindee Lakes the expedition was subject to increasing confrontation from the native inhabitants and Mitchell decided it would be too dangerous to proceed and decided to turn back. Mitchell named the ephemeral lakes in the area &#x27;Laidley&#x27;s Chain of Ponds&#x27; after James Laidley, the Deputy Commissary-General of New South Wales. The Barkindji people called the lakes &#x27;wontanella&#x27; meaning &quot;many waters&quot;.

An expedition led by Charles Sturt arrived at Laidley’s Ponds in October 1844, the initial stage of a series of explorations in Central Australia searching for the north-south watershed of the continent and an inland sea. The party established a base camp at Lake Cawndilla (south-west of present-day Menindee) and over two months made several scouting expeditions into and beyond the Barrier Range. In December 1844 Sturt’s party moved further north to the Grey Range, after which they undertook a number of exploratory trips into the dry interior, before returning to Adelaide in January 1846.

===European settlement===
The Darling Pastoral District between the Murrumbidgee and Darling rivers was officially proclaimed on 4 December 1847. In 1849 Alexander McCallum took up the &#x27;Menindee&#x27; pastoral lease. In September 1850 it was reported that &quot;the commandant of the Native Police… and his gallant band&quot; were &quot;at Laidley Ponds&quot; to investigate &quot;aggressions… committed on shepherds&quot;. The account stated that &quot;the natives had been very troublesome, and some parties had been obliged to abandon their stations.&quot; In 1851 the government surveyor Francis McCabe surveyed and mapped the lower Darling River. His plan of survey named the locality as &quot;Minnindia&quot;. In about 1852 Thomas Pain, with his wife Bridget and children, settled at the site of Menindee and built a shanty hotel to provide services to travellers along the Darling River. Another source states the public house was built in about 1855, possibly by &quot;a man named Williams&quot;. In any case Thomas Pain was certainly in possession of the building by 1860.

In late January 1859 Captain Francis Cadell in charge of the &quot;Albury&quot; steamer entered the Darling River at its junction with the Murray and after four days travel he reached the site of Menindee before continuing on for a further four days until he reached the &#x27;Mount Murchison&#x27; pastoral run. Cadell’s pioneering voyage on the Darling &quot;demonstrated that the river could be navigated for the purpose of carrying on trade&quot;.

In 1860 Thomas Pain was contracted to take mail on horseback once a fortnight along the Darling between Wentworth to Mount Murchison. Francis Cadell established a depot store at Menindee (which he sold in about 1862).

The Burke and Wills expedition camped at Menindee on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They arrived here on 14 October 1860, crossed the Darling River at Kinchega Station and made Camp XXXIV (their thirty-fourth camp since leaving Melbourne). There was dissent within the party and the deputy-leader George Landells resigned. Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke split the party, heading north to Cooper Creek with half the men, stores and animals. The remaining men, stores and animals made a depot camp at Pamamaroo Creek (a sign and cairn mark the site of the camp). This camp was used for the remainder of 1860 and for most of 1861. While in Menindee, Burke stayed at Thomas Pain&#x27;s hotel. Pain was later reimbursed by the Victorian Exploration Committee for outstanding accounts.

In October 1861 Menindee was described as a settlement consisting of the following buildings: &quot;a public-house, a store, and a hut in the occupation of the police&quot;. The population of permanent residents numbered &quot;about fifteen souls, including women and children&quot;.

===A government township===
The location of Menindee was surveyed in preparation for land sales in 1861 and the name &quot;Perry&quot; (&quot;with but little regard for euphony&quot;) chosen by the colonial government. In June 1862 it was notified that &quot;the approved Plan&quot; for &quot;a Town to be called Perry&quot; had been deposited for public inspection in Sydney and with &quot;the Land Agent at Wentworth&quot;. The name &quot;Perry&quot; was unpopular with the locals and the subject of ridicule in the colonial press. One report in July 1862 speculated that the name was a &quot;cheap honor, we suppose, to some political snob&quot; and suggested that &quot;winkle&quot; might have been added to the name &quot;and then we should have known what creature was intended to be honored&quot;. The first land sales at Perry (Menindee) were held in July 1862. In November 1863 the previous notification for the town to be called &quot;Perry&quot; was rescinded. The notice in the Government Gazette explained that &quot;it has been considered expedient to alter the name of the Town in question to the native name of the locality, viz., Menindee, by which it is not only better known by the Colonists, but has become celebrated in the annals of Australian Exploration&quot;.

In 1866 Thomas Pain sold his inn &quot;to a man named Robertson or Robinson&quot; and &quot;after a few months it again changed hands&quot;. The new owner was Christopher Quinn who was granted a publican’s license in July 1866 (probably the first license obtained for the establishment). Quinn named his public house the Menindie Hotel.

An application was submitted in 1868 for a government school at Menindee. Classes began in a temporary structure in 1869. In June 1873 it was reported that the Council of Education in Sydney was experiencing &quot;great difficulty in providing a teacher for the public school at Menindie… on account of the distance of that place from Sydney&quot;.

It was recorded in September 1875 that &quot;Menindie maintains a public Hospital, a Catholic Church, besides hotels and stores&quot;.

In November 1878 Menindee was described as &quot;yet only a small place&quot;, consisting of &quot;four public-houses, two good stores, a Post and Telegraph Office, Court-house, a Police-station, with its necessary adjuncts, and, as near as I could judge, about twenty cottages scattered about&quot;.

At the time of the 1881 Census Menindee had a population of 261 persons (156 males and 105 females). A new post and telegraph office was completed at Menindee in 1881. Soon after it was built it was described by a correspondent as &quot;by far the most handsome building in the town&quot;. A visitor to Menindee in August 1881 described the lay-out of the town as &quot;higgledy-piggledy&quot;, adding: &quot;Perched on a collection of little sandhills, which effectually raise it above all floods, it is composed of buildings, most of them brick, which, judging from their appearance, might have been dropped down by chance, like a collection of children&#x27;s toy bricks&quot;.

At the time of the 1891 Census Menindee had a population of 194 persons (113 males and 81 females).

A January 1924 account of Menindee describes it as &quot;probably the most casual of all villages in the State&quot;. The &quot;dozen or so houses that constitute Menindie&quot; seemed to be set out without a town-plan; &quot;of streets or roads, there are none, the only few yards of made surface being the approach to the punt&quot;.

A direct railway connection between Sydney and Broken Hill was accomplished with the completion in October 1927 of a railway bridge over the Darling near Menindee. The iron bridge was of the bascule type, with a centre span hinging at one end to permit river steamers to pass. The bridge had provision for a roadway as well as a railway on a single deck.

== Heritage listings ==
Menindee has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
*15 km south-west: Kinchega Woolshed

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 551 people in Menindee.
*Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 36.1% of the population. 
*79.3% of people were born in Australia and 84.3% of people only spoke English at home. 
*The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.3% and Roman Catholic 23.6%.

==Schools==
Menindee Central School serving K-12.

==Geography==

The village of Menindee sits on a sandhill above the floodplain on the north bank of the Darling River. The sand dunes and sand plains of the area are characterised by light-textured red sand and loams which are susceptible to wind erosion. The floodplain is characterised by a grey cracking clay (black soil) supporting open woodlands dominated by black box trees.

The Kinchega National Park is situated on the western edge of town.

==Natural environment==

===Menindee nightshade===

The threatened Menindee nightshade (&quot;Solanum karsense&quot;) is named after the Menindee region, one of the locations where it is known to occur. It is a grey-green downy forb with spines scattered along the stems, bearing purple flowers (typically solanum-type) in spring. The Menindee nightshade is restricted to the far south-western plains of NSW, mainly in the area between the Darling and Lachlan rivers, along the Darling between Menindee and Wilcannia, and across to Broken Hill. It has been recorded from Kinchega National Park near Menindee.

==Water supply==
A weir on the Darling River near Menindee diverts water from the river into a series of shallow, otherwise dry, overflow lakes. The Menindee Lakes, also known as the Menindee Water Storage Scheme, regulate the river flow for irrigation downstream into South Australia.

Menindee residents had complained about the town&#x27;s &quot;putrid&quot; water quality and claimed that cotton growers were removing water from the river during the recent drought. Generally the health of river systems is reliant on summer rains. Some locals were carting water from other sources. The WaterNSW advised property owners not to water their stock from the Darling.

The river is subject to blooms of blue green algae in summer. Richard Kingsford, Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW said the Menindee Lakes had been drained more often than in the past. In July 2018, 23 gigalitres of environmental water was delivered to the Darling River; this reconnected isolated parts of the river and flushed out algae.

In early 2019, up to one million native fish were found dead along a 40-kilometre stretch of the river in Menindee, including the large and critically endangered Murray cod. The apparent trigger for these deaths was a sudden drop in temperature, causing much of the algae bloom to decompose. The levels of dissolved oxygen in the river then fell too low for the fish to survive.

Widespread rainfall over north-west NSW and southern Queensland during January/February 2020 started to flow into Menindee Lakes (Lake Wetherell) on 10 March. It was estimated that over 550 gigalitres would reach Menindee Lakes as a result of this flow event. Increased numbers of waterbirds have been observed in the area. The area flooded again in early 2023.

==Climate==
Menindee has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, featuring hot, dry summers and short, cool winters. The annual average rainfall is which would make it a semi-arid climate except that its high evapotranspiration, or its barrenness, makes it a desert climate. Rainfall varies significantly from year to year, with the town often going without rainfall for months on end, but occasional severe rainstorms can cause falls of over 100 mm in a day, the last time this happened being January 2011. 

Menindee is tied with Bourke in recording the highest temperature in New South Wales, with a temperature of 49.7 °C (121.5 °F) recorded on 10 January 1939.
== Transport ==
The transcontinental railway line crosses the Darling River at Menindee. The railway line is about west of Sydney and about south-east of Broken Hill. Menindee is served by NSW TrainLink&#x27;s &quot;Outback Xplorer&quot; service between Sydney and Broken Hill with one train in each direction per week. Trains head west (to Broken Hill) on Mondays and east on Tuesdays.

A community access bus service runs to Broken Hill and return Monday to Friday (except public holidays), run by CDC Broken Hill (formerly Murton&#x27;s City Bus Pty Ltd).

No major highway runs through Menindee but the Barrier Highway between Adelaide and Nyngan runs nearby to the north through Broken Hill.

<text>Metallum Martis, a 1665 book by Dud Dudley, is the earliest known reference to the use of coal in metallurgical smelting. The book is also referred to as &quot;Iron made with Pit-Coale, Sea-Coale, &amp;c. And with the same Fuell to Melt and Fine Imperfect Mettals, And Refine perfect Mettals.&quot;

Many attendant difficulties had to be overcome before this fuel could be applied to the purpose of smelting iron. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on Pensnett Chase and at Cradley, of a furnace at Himley, and of a furnace at Hasco Bridge near Gornal.

Dudley does mention several things that indicate what he was doing. The coal he used was the small pieces and slack which were &quot;little or of no use in that inland country&quot; and so brought in no money. This coal debris was left in heaps and &quot;crowded moist slack heat naturally, and kindle in the middle of these great heaps, often sets the coal works on fire&quot; and that &quot;Also from these sulphurous heaps, mixed with ironstone (for out of many of the same pits is gotten much ironstone or mine), the fires heating vast quantities of water, passing through these soughs or adits becometh as hot as the bath at Bath&quot;. Dudley describes two rival attempts to smelt iron with coal instigated by supporters of Parliament during the Civil War and the Interregnum. Dudley visited both sites and having examined their furnaces and production methods, when asked his opinion, informed the proprietors that they would fail. The first attempt was by Captain Buck, with the backing of many parliamentary officers including Oliver Cromwell, with technical help from Edward Dagney, an Italian. In the second attempt in the late 1656–67 by Captain John Copley also failed despite Dudley, at no charge, improving the efficiency of Copley&#x27;s bellows. Dudley reapplied for a patent from Charles II, in 1660 stating &quot;and seeing no man able to perform the mastery of making of iron with pit-coal or sea-coal, ... [without my] laudable inventions the author was, and is, unwilling [that they] should fall to the ground and die with him&quot;.
A significant feature of his great work &quot;Metallum Martis&quot; is a map showing Dudley Castle where he correctly identifies the order and geographic layout of strata of coal and ironstone under survey.

Considered to be the earliest of recorded geologic maps, &quot;Metallum Martis&quot; marks a turning point in the evolution of scientific rationale concerning the recording and interpretation of geological information. It is considered to have been made at Castle Hill in Dudley by Dud Dudley in 1665.

<text>Suckdog was an American underground band. The core members were the married couple Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costes. Suckdog toured the continental United States for several years with &quot;Suckdog Circus,&quot; performing a mix of wrestling, musical performances, film screenings, and general audience agitation. The heart of the Suckdog Circus were the noise music &quot;operas&quot; written by Costes and Carver which involved strange experimental fantasy stories with much blood and sex.

Other performers in the Suckdog Circus included Dame Darcy, Davey &quot;OHIO&quot; Highben, Coz the Shroom, Nick Zedd and Helen Suckpuppy.

A DVD was released in 2005 by Nut Music entitled &quot;Drugs Are Nice: A Suckumentary 1988-2005&quot;, containing excerpts of various performances, music videos, short films, and commentary from Lisa Crystal Carver and friends.

<text>Canadiana is a term used to describe things (e.g., books, historical documents, works of art, music and artifacts), ideas, or activities that concern or are distinctive of Canada, its peoples, and/or its culture, especially works of literature and other cultural products. It can also refer to the collection of such materials, such as in cultural fields like music or art.

As a category often seen in bookstores and in research libraries, Canadiana can describe works produced in Canada (including literature and non-fiction), works about Canada, and works published outside of Canada that are of special interest or significance to Canada. More generally, the term can also include books that do not necessarily deal with Canada or Canadians themselves, but were written by Canadians or people who were Canadians at some point in their life. Two books by Canadian author Douglas Coupland—&quot;Souvenir of Canada&quot; and &quot;Souvenir of Canada 2&quot;—for example, are collections of images of pop-culture Canadiana. 

== Name ==
The suffixes &quot;-ana&quot; and &quot;-iana&quot; are commonly used in reference to a collection of things that relate to a specific place, person, etc. Similar to the concept of Canadiana is that of Americana for the United States.The term Canuckiana has been used (rarely), in humorous contexts, as a synonym for Canadiana.

==Library system==
Since 1950, one of the specific mandates of the Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has been to document the published heritage of Canada through a comprehensive bibliography—titled Canadiana: The National Bibliography of Canada.

In OCLC&#x27;s WorldShare integrated library system, the Canadiana authority file contains two record types:

# &quot;Canadiana Subject Headings In English&quot;, a list of subject headings in the English language, using controlled vocabulary, to &quot;access and express the topic content of documents on Canada and Canadian topics.&quot; , the database contains around 2,500 subject and geographic name headings in English. When cataloguing in English, LAC uses the Library of Congress/NACO Authority File (LC/NAF). 
# &quot;Canadiana Name Authorities in French&quot;, used by LAC and other Canadian libraries when creating bibliographic descriptions in French. The database contains over 600,000 records for names, names/titles, uniform titles, and series titles.

<text>Vannes (; , , ) is a commune in the French department of Morbihan, Brittany, northwestern mainland France. It was founded over 2,000 years ago.

==History==

===Celtic Era===

The name &quot;Vannes&quot; comes from the Veneti, a seafaring Celtic people who lived in the south-western part of Armorica in Gaul before the Roman invasions. The region seems to have been involved in a cross channel trade for thousands of years, probably using hide boats and perhaps Ferriby Boats. Wheat that apparently was grown in the Middle East was part of this trade. At about 150 BC the evidence of trade (such as Gallo-Belgic coins) with the Thames estuary area of Great Britain dramatically increased.

===Roman Era===
The Veneti were defeated by Julius Caesar&#x27;s fleet in 56 BC in front of Locmariaquer; many of the Veneti were then either slaughtered or sold into slavery. The Romans settled a town called Darioritum in a location previously belonging to the Veneti.

===The Britons arrive===
From the 5th to the 7th century, the remaining Gauls were displaced or assimilated by waves of immigrant Britons fleeing the Saxon invasions of Britain. Under the Breton name Gwened (also derived from the Veneti), the town was the center of an independent principality or kingdom variously called Bro-Wened (&quot;Vannes&quot;) or Bro-Ereg (&quot;land of Gwereg&quot;), the latter for a prominent member of its dynasty, which claimed descent from Caradog Strongarm. The diocese of Vannes was erected in the 5th century. The Council of Vannes was held there in 461. The realm annexed Cornouaille for a time in the early 6th century but was permanently joined with Domnonia under its king and Saint Judicaël around 635.

===Breton War of Succession===
In 1342, Vannes was besieged four times between forces from both sides of the Breton War of Succession. The city&#x27;s defending commander, Olivier IV de Clisson, was captured by the English but finally released. The French eventually executed him since they suspected him of being a traitor since the ransom was unusually low.

===18th century===
In 1759, Vannes was used as the staging point for a planned French invasion of Britain. A large army was assembled there, but it was never able to sail after the French naval defeat at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759.

In 1795, during the French Revolution, French forces based in Vannes successfully repelled a planned British-Royalist invasion through Quiberon.

===19th century===
The Hotel de Ville was completed in 1886.

==Geography==
Vannes, located on the Gulf of Morbihan at the mouth of two rivers, the Marle and the Vincin, is around northwest of Nantes and 450 km (280 miles) south west of Paris. Vannes is a market town linked to the sea.

===Climate===
==Transport==

Train
The Vannes railway station offers connections to Quimper, Rennes, Nantes, Paris and several regional destinations.
With the fast train TGV, the journey takes:
– 30 minutes to Lorient,
– 1 hour to Nantes or Rennes,
– 2.5 to 4 hours to Paris.
The Transport express régional or TER is a slower train to join railway stations in the close neighborhood, such as Auray or Questembert.
There is no direct line from Vannes to Saint-Brieuc (118 km away in the north of Brittany), so the train from Vannes to Saint Brieuc goes via Rennes, which doubles the travel time and cost: it takes 2 to 3 hours to go from Vannes to Saint Brieuc by train.

Car
Two highways, in the north of Vannes, provide fast connections by car:
– N165: west to Lorient (58 km) and Quimper (122 km), south east to Nantes (111 km)
– N166: north east to Rennes (113 km)
+ a network of small roads connects Vannes to smaller cities.
There is no highway from Vannes to Saint-Brieuc, so the way to northern Brittany consists of small roads. The lack of highway or railway between Vannes and Saint-Brieuc (118 km north) cuts the communications between northern and southern Brittany, and limits Brittany economic performance.

Airplanes
Vannes has a small airfield in the village of Monterblanc, called Vannes-Meucon airport, or &quot;Vannes – Golfe du Morbihan airport&quot;. It used to be a military airport, but it is now dedicated to general aviation aircraft. It belongs to Vannes Agglomeration community, the group of cities gathered around Vannes, and the main users of this airfield are Vannes flying club, the local ultralight aviation club, and Vannes school of skydiving.

Bus
There are 2 bus networks in Vannes:
– Kicéo, proposes short travels starting from Vannes Place de la Republique on behalf of Vannes Agglomeration community,
– CAT, propose longer travel starting from the railway station on behalf of Morbihan.
So there are 2 central bus stations in Vannes: one on Place de la Libération, the other at the railway station.

Bike
Vannes has a public bicycle rental program, called Vélocéo based on the same idea as the Paris Vélib&#x27;.
Hundreds of bicycles are available across 10 automated rental stations each with 10 to fifteen bikes/spaces.
Each Vélocéo service station is equipped with an automatic rental terminal and stands for bicycles.
This replaces the Velocea service, which was discontinued in August 2017.

==Population==
Inhabitants of Vannes are called &quot;Vannetais&quot;.

<text>The Italian Space Agency (; ASI) is a government agency established in 1988 to fund, regulate and coordinate space exploration activities in Italy. The agency cooperates with numerous national and international entities who are active in aerospace research and technology.

Nationally, ASI is responsible for both drafting the National Aerospace Plan and ensuring it is carried out. To do this the agency operates as the owner/coordinator of a number of Italian space research agencies and assets such as CIRA as well as organising the calls and opportunities process for Italian industrial contractors on spaceflight projects. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy&#x27;s delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies as well as representing the country&#x27;s interests in foreign collaborations.

ASI&#x27;s main headquarters are located in Rome, Italy, and the agency also has direct control over two operational centres: the Centre for Space Geodesy (CGS) located in Matera in Italy, and its own spaceport, the Broglio Space Centre (formerly the ) on the coastal sublittoral of Kenya, currently used only as a communications ground station. One further balloon launch base located in Trapani was permanently closed in 2010. In 2020, ASI&#x27;s annual revenues budget was approximately €2.0 billion and it directly employed around 200 workers.

== History ==

=== Early Italian aerospace ===

Activities started officially in 1988 but the agency drew extensively on the work of earlier national organisations as well as the consolidated experience of the many Italian scientists that had been investigating space and astronautics since the end of the 19th century. Some of the most outstanding names in Italian space exploration since its inception were the following:

* Giulio Costanzi (1875–1965), his 1914 writing of space navigation is considered the first Italian contribution to astronautics.
* Luigi Gussalli (1885–1950), astronautics pioneer since the 1920s, corresponded with international space scientists such as Oberth and Goddard. He invented a double-reaction jet engine, developed multi-stage rockets, suggested a Moon mission and solar radiation powered spaceships.
* Gaetano Arturo Crocco (1877-1968), aeronautics and astronautics pioneer, invented the first all-Italian liquid-fuelled combustion chamber and aided in the development of the gravity assist technique for use on planetary fly-by&#x27;s by space probes.
* Luigi Crocco (1909-1986), son of Gaetano Arturo, an internationally renowned scientist in aerodynamics theory and jet propulsion.
* Aurelio Robotti, expert on rocket liquid fuels, father of the first Italian liquid-fuelled rocket, AR3.
* Luigi Broglio (1911-2001), the unanimously recognized father of Italian astronautics, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Italian von Braun&quot;. Under his guidance Italy built and operated a satellite in orbit around the Earth and became the first country to deploy an equatorial launching pad, the San Marco, and to experiment successful launching from it.
* Carlo Buongiorno, Broglio&#x27;s pupil and the first director general of ASI.

=== San Marco programme ===
Early Italian space efforts during the Space Race era were built around cooperation between the Italian Space Commission (a branch of the National Research Council) and NASA supported primarily by the Centro Ricerche Aerospaziali, the aerospace research group of the University of Rome La Sapienza. This plan, conceived by Luigi Broglio, led to the San Marco programme of Italian-built satellites beginning with the launch of Italy&#x27;s first satellite, San Marco 1, from Wallops Island.

The San Marco project since 1967 was focused on the launching of scientific satellites by Scout rockets from a mobile rigid platform located close to the equator. This station, composed of 3 oil platforms and two logistical support boats, was installed off the Kenya coast, close to the town of Malindi.

Italy would later launch further satellites in the series (San Marco 2 in 1967, San Marco 3 in 1971, San Marco 4 in 1974 and San Marco D/L in 1988 ) using the American Scout rockets like the original, but from its own spaceport.

=== Co-operation and consolidation ===

As one of the earliest countries to be engaged in space exploration, Italy became a founder and key partner in the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), established on 29 March and 14 June 1962 respectively. Both of these would later merge to form the European Space Agency on 30 April 1975.

Further work would continue under the direction of the National Research Council including the launch of an indigenous telecoms/research satellite called SIRIO-1 in 1977. A planned follow-up mission SIRIO-2 was destroyed in the Ariane 1 L-05 launch failure. During the 1980s, it became clear of the need to rationalise and strengthen Italy&#x27;s position in space research and so the decision was made to create the Italian Space Agency to further coordinate the nation&#x27;s space activities.

== Programmes ==

=== Robotic exploration ===


ASI&#x27;s first large scientific satellite mission was BeppoSAX, developed in collaboration with the Netherlands and launched in 1996. Named after Giuseppe “Beppo” Occhialini, an important figure in Italian high-energy physics, the satellite was a mission to study the universe in the X-ray part of the spectrum.

Following on from this ASI developed another high-energy astronomical satellite, AGILE for gamma ray astronomy, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2007. A particular innovation was the use of a single instrument to measure both Gamma rays and hard X-rays.

ASI also has collaborated on many major international space exploration missions including;

* Cassini-Huygens, a joint NASA/ESA/ASI mission to the Saturn system launched in 1997. The mission has made many new discoveries and increased understanding of the gas giant&#x27;s environment, particularly Saturn&#x27;s varied moons. ASI supplied Cassini&#x27;s large high-gain antenna and radar package as well as involvement in other instruments.
* INTEGRAL, ESA&#x27;s advanced gamma ray observatory launched in 2002.
* Mars Express, the first Western European mission to Mars launched in 2003. Through ASI, Italy provided two important instruments for the mission; MARSIS a radar altimeter and the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer which discovered concentrations of methane in the Martian atmosphere.
* Rosetta, an ambitious ESA mission to orbit and for the first time in history land a probe on a comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to study it in detail as it enters the inner solar system. This long duration mission was launched in 2004 and arrived at its destination in 2014. Rosetta carries the Italian-built VIRTIS instrument while the Philae Lander&#x27;s sampling/drilling system, SD2, is another major Italian contribution.
* Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, a NASA-led international mission to provide rapid detection of short-lived Gamma-ray Bursts. ASI provides the use of the ground station facility as the San Marco spaceport.
* Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a NASA mission to Mars launched in 2005. The SHARAD radar was supplied by Italy using experience from MARSIS.
* Venus Express, the sister-probe to Mars Express built using the same spacecraft bus and the first Western European mission to Venus. Launched in 2005, ASI contributed a version of VIRTIS spectrometer.
* Dawn, a 2007 NASA mission that will study the largest of the Asteroid Belt&#x27;s objects, the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. Italy has provided VIR-MS, another evolution of the VIRTIS instrument.
* Juno, contributed the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper on this mission to planet Jupiter.
* Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), a NASA mission to test planetary defense by crashing toward an asteroid, small spacecraft called LICIACube created by ASI will observe the result. LICIACube is the first autonomous spacecraft developed by Italian team in deep space.

Italy&#x27;s space industry has also been involved in many other scientific missions such as SOHO, Cluster II, ISO, XMM-Newton and Planck.

The technology experiments TSS-1 and TSS-1R were also conducted in partnership with NASA.

=== Launcher development ===

Currently ASI is a partner in the Ariane 5 launcher programme and more recently is the major (65%) backer of the ESA Vega small launcher, capable of putting a payload of 1500 kg to low Earth orbit.

=== Earth observation ===

ASI is a participant in many of ESA&#x27;s programmes in the field of Earth Observation such as ERS-1, ERS-2, ENVISAT, the Meteosat series and the Galileo satellite navigation system. The agency has also collaborated with other European and international partners such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission with NASA.

In October 1992, NASA launched LAGEOS-2 (following LAGEOS-1 launched in 1976) in cooperation with ASI. A passive satellite, it is an aluminum plated brass sphere covered with retroreflectors to reflect laser ranging beams emitted from ground stations on Earth. The primary mission goals were to determine accurately Earth&#x27;s Geoid and to measure Tectonic plate movement. In 2010 ASI&#x27;s own satellite, LARES, will be launched using the Vega rocket. The mission is designed to carry out similar studies to that of LAGEOS 2 but with much greater precision.

The Italian Space Agency, under direction of both the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Defence, developed the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of satellites for both military and civilian use in a broad range of areas.

The Italian Space Agency launched in 2019 the multimission program PLATiNO (mini Piattaforma spaziaLe ad Alta TecNOlogia, High-Technology Mini-Satellite Platform), to develop industrial capability in the small satellites sector. The first mission in 2023 will embark a SAR, the second one in 2024 a Thermal Infrared Imager.

=== Human spaceflight ===

Through ASI, the Italian space industry is an active player in human spaceflight activities.

The three Space Shuttle Multi-Purpose Logistics Module cargo containers &quot;Leonardo&quot;, &quot;Raffaello&quot; and &quot;Donatello&quot;, were manufactured at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center in Turin, Italy by Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space. They provide a key function in storing equipment and parts for transfer to the International Space Station.

A number of ISS modules have also been made in Italy. As part of ESA&#x27;s contribution to the costs of the International Space Station, Alcatel Alenia Space manufactured &quot;Tranquility&quot;, &quot;Harmony&quot; as well as the &quot;Cupola&quot; observation deck for NASA.

ESA&#x27;s &quot;Columbus&quot; module, Western Europe&#x27;s primary scientific lab on board the ISS, was again built in Turin based on Italy&#x27;s previous experience in space station module construction.

== Italian astronauts ==

As an ESA member heavily involved in human spaceflight, ASI sponsors a select few Italian citizens to train at ESA&#x27;s European Astronaut Corps (EAC) to represent the country on missions. Italians to have flown in space are:

* Franco Malerba, Italy&#x27;s first astronaut and the only one not to fly as a member of the EAC. He flew on STS-46 (31 July to 7 August 1992) as payload specialist on the first Tethered Satellite System mission.
* Umberto Guidoni, flew on STS-75 (22 February to 9 March 1996) as payload specialist on the second Tethered Satellite System mission - TSS-1R. He became the first Italian and European on the International Space Station during STS-100 (19 April to 1 May 2001).
* Maurizio Cheli, flew with Umberto Guidoni as a mission specialist on STS-75.
* Roberto Vittori, has flown on multiple missions to the ISS: Soyuz TM-33, Soyuz TM-34, Soyuz TMA-5, Soyuz TMA-6 and STS-134.
* Paolo A. Nespoli, flew on STS-120 (23 October to 7 November 2007),; he then returned two more times on the ISS: one for the long duration MagISStra mission (Expedition 26/27, from 15 December 2010, to 23 May 2011) aboard the Soyuz TMA-20 and the other for the Vita mission (Expedition 52/53)
* Luca Parmitano, selected in February 2009, flew aboard Soyuz TMA-09M on 28 May 2013, arriving at the International Space Station the following day. He returned to Earth on 11 November 2013. He returned to the ISS on board the Soyuz MS-13 mission from 20 July 2019 to 6 February 2020. During this time he served as Flight Engineer on Expedition 60 and Commander on Expedition 61.
* Samantha Cristoforetti, also selected in 2009, flew to the International Space Station aboard Soyuz TMA-15M on 23 November 2014. Her original return date was delayed by one month after the failure of two Russian rockets extended her stay in space past the European astronaut and female astronaut endurance records. Her return to Earth, on 11 June 2015, concluded her 199d 16h 42m in space. She was on the ISS with Expedition 67 from 27 April 2022 as a part of SpaceX Crew-4 mission and took command of ISS Expedition 68 from 28 September 2022 to 14 October 2022, when she returned to Earth aboard Crew Dragon Endurance.

<text>Keepit Dam is a major gated mass concrete gravity dam with an earth fill abutment and a central gated concrete overflow crest and six radial gate spillways across the Namoi River upstream of its junction with the Peel River in the North West Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam&#x27;s purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Keepit.

==Location and features==
Commenced in 1939, with construction halted during World War II, and completed in 1960, the Keepit Dam is a major dam on the Namoi River, located approximately west of Tamworth and north-east of Gunnedah, upstream of the confluence of the Namoi and Peel rivers. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation &amp; Irrigation Commission to supply water for irrigation, flood mitigation and potable water for the town of Walgett.

The dam wall height is and is long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Lake Keepit is and the catchment area is . The central gated overflow crest and six radial gates of the spillway are capable of discharging . An A$146.6 million upgrade of facilities commenced in 2009 and resulted in the construction of two spillways and three saddle dams, completed during 2011. A further upgrade is due to commence in 2014 for completion by 2016 that will involve raising the height of the main dam wall by and enhancing post tension in the concrete section of the wall.

Keepit Dam is operated in conjunction with Split Rock Dam. The two dams supply water requirements along much of the Namoi Valley, used for irrigation including cotton, cereal and wheat crops, lucerne, fodder and pasture, vegetables, vines, orchards and oil seeds.

===Power generation===

A hydro-electric power station generates up to of electricity from the flow of the water leaving Keepit Dam with an average output of per annum. The station was completed in 1960 and upgraded in 1983. The facility is managed by Meridian Energy.

==Etymology==
The name Keepit originates after a riverside property called &quot;Keypit&quot; or &quot;Keepit&quot;, resumed for part of the storage area. The word probably means &#x27;keep it&#x27;, a derogatory remark about the apparent worthlessness of the pastoral run.

==Recreation==
The area surrounding Lake Keepit is used for local recreation including camping, picnics, swimming, boating, sailing, water skiing and fishing. The lakeshore is the location of Lake Keepit Soaring Club, the second largest gliding club by membership in Australia.

<doc id="716985" wikidata="Q786778" url="?curid=716985" title="Twist and Shout">
<text>&quot;Twist and Shout&quot; is a 1961 song written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns (later credited as &quot;Bert Russell&quot;). It was originally recorded by The Top Notes, but it did not become a hit in the record charts until it was reworked by the Isley Brothers for their album &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; in 1962. The song has been covered by several artists, including the Beatles, Salt-N-Pepa, and Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers, who experienced chart success with their versions.

==Original version==
The Top Notes, an American R&amp;B vocal group, recorded &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; at the Atlantic Studios on February 23, 1961. The session was arranged by Teddy Randazzo and produced by Phil Spector. The Top Notes&#x27; Howard &quot;Howie&quot; Guyton provided the lead vocals, with accompaniment by saxophonist King Curtis, guitarist John Pizzarelli, drummer Panama Francis, and backing vocalists the Cookies.

In a song review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger described the Top Notes recording as &quot;a Latin-tinged raveup with a drab generic R&amp;B melody&quot; that he felt was &quot;not very good&quot;. Bert Berns, the song&#x27;s co-writer, was dissatisfied with the recording and Spector&#x27;s production. It failed to chart.

==The Isley Brothers version==

When the Isley Brothers decided to record the song in 1962 for their album &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot;, Berns (who also used the name Bert Russell) assumed the role of producer. According to Unterberger, the new arrangement infused the tune with more &quot;gospel-fired soul passion&quot;: 

&quot;Twist and Shout&quot; became the group&#x27;s first single to reach the Top 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

This version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010.

==The Beatles version==

The Beatles&#x27; rendition of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was released on their first UK album &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in 1963, inspired by the Isley Brothers&#x27; version. John Lennon provided the lead vocals and initially felt ashamed of his performance in the song &quot;because I could sing better than that, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me. You can hear that I&#x27;m just a frantic guy doing his best.&quot; A second take was attempted, but Lennon had nothing left due to a hoarse voice, and it was abandoned. At the end of the song, Lennon can be heard coughing. The Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; has been called &quot;the most famous single take in rock history.&quot; Mark Lewisohn called it &quot;arguably the most stunning rock and roll vocal and instrumental performance of all time.&quot;

The song was released as a single in the US on March 2, 1964, with &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; as its B-side. It was released by Chicago-based Vee-Jay Records on the Tollie label and reached 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s singles chart on April 4, during the week that the top five places on the chart were all Beatles singles. It was the only million-selling Beatles single in the U.S. that was a cover song, and the only Beatles cover single to reach the top 10 on a national record chart. The song failed to hit No. 1 because the group&#x27;s own follow-up single &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; held the spot. &quot;Cash Box&quot; rated the song No. 1 that same week.

In the UK, &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was released by Parlophone on an eponymous EP with &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; from the &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (1963) album. Both the EP and album reached No. 1. In Canada, it became the title track to the second album of Beatles material to be issued by Capitol Records of Canada on February 3, 1964.

The song was used as the Beatles&#x27; closing number on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; in October 1963 and at &quot;The Royal Variety Show&quot; in November 1963; the &quot;Royal Variety&quot; performance was included on the &quot;Anthology 1&quot; compilation album in 1995. The Beatles performed the song on their &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; appearance in February 1964, and they continued to play it live until the end of their 1965 American tour. Additionally, they recorded &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; on nine occasions for BBC television and radio broadcasts, the earliest of which was for the &quot;Talent Spot&quot; radio show on November 27, 1962.

In 1986, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) lip-synced to the Beatles&#x27; version of the song in the film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Coincidentally, the Rodney Dangerfield film &quot;Back to School&quot; (released two days after &quot;Ferris&quot;) also featured the song, this one sung by Dangerfield himself in character as Thornton Mellon and patterned after the Beatles&#x27; arrangement. The use in the two films helped propel the single up the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 23 at the issue date September 27, 1986, giving the group their second chart single of the 1980s (the other being &quot;The Beatles Movie Medley&quot; in 1982).

In November 2010, 47 years after its recording, the Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; made a debut on the UK Singles Chart. One of a number of Beatles tracks re-entering the chart in the aftermath of their new availability on iTunes, it peaked at No. 48.

==Brian Poole and the Tremeloes version==
In 1962, Decca Records signed Brian Poole and the Tremeloes, a British group from Dagenham, East London, in preference to the Beatles. Both groups had auditioned on the same day, and it has become legend that the Beatles were rejected by the label. Ironically, Brian Poole and the Tremeloes had no chart success until the beat boom in British rock had surfaced, following the success of the Beatles. This triggered the frenzied signing of most of the popular Liverpool rock groups of that period by the major record labels, and their distinctive &quot;sound&quot; became known as Merseybeat. Brian Poole and the Tremeloes imitated this style, and covered &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; for their album of the same name four months after the Beatles had released their version, and achieved the No. 4 position in the UK Singles Chart.

However, according to Brian Poole, &quot;we were doing &#x27;Twist and Shout&#x27; on stage before we knew anybody else doing it and we felt we could have a hit with it. Unfortunately, we had it in the can for about a year before Decca decided to release it as a single&quot;.

==Salt-N-Pepa version==

American hip hop trio Salt-N-Pepa recorded a cover version on their 1988 album &quot;A Salt with a Deadly Pepa&quot;. It was released as a single and was met with success, reaching the top five in Spain, the Netherlands and the UK, where it reached No. 4, as well as the top 40 in Belgium and Germany and on the Irish Singles Chart.

==Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers version==
Jamaican reggae duo Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers, collaborating with Jack Radics and Taxi Gang, recorded &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; for their fourth album, &quot;Tease Me&quot; (1993). It was released as single on December 6, 1993 by Mango and Island, and topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 1994. The song was also a top-10 hit in Ireland (No. 9), Flanders (No. 7), the Netherlands (No. 6), Denmark (No. 4), and New Zealand (No. 2).

===Critical reception===
Rick Anderson from AllMusic felt the song is &quot;a fun novelty&quot;. Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Who&#x27;da thunk this Beatles evergreen would become viable fodder for a reggae reconstruction? It has, and it works far better than you might imagine.&quot; He added, &quot;With assistance from Jack Radis and Taxi Gang, Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers playfully skip around a fast and jaunty island groove, darting in and out of familiar lyrics with bits of chatter and toasting. Visionary programmers will find this will flow over playlists like a fresh, cool breeze.&quot; Troy J. Augusto from &quot;Cash Box&quot; declared it as an &quot;infectious cut&quot;, that &quot;add peppy new island life to this classic made famous, of course, by The Beatles.&quot;

In a review for the &quot;Gavin Report&quot;, Dave Sholin commented, &quot;Summertime—time to hit the beach and party! And what better for the occasion than this upbeat production that puts a new twist on the Isley Brothers&#x27; original and Beatles&#x27; cover?&quot; Alan Jones from &quot;Music Week&quot; deemed it a &quot;fine reggae re-reading&quot;, that &quot;contains all the usual Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers hallmarks, with sweetly cooed verses alternating with rapped passages. Just right for the party season.&quot; James Hamilton from the &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Dance Update described it as a La Bamba&#x27; based raver&#x27;s reggae inflected but surprisingly conventional Sly &amp; Robbie revival, a party season smash&quot;. Leesa Daniels from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; three out of five, writing, &quot;&quot;The&quot; tune at Christmas parties this year. Chaka and Pliers and a few mates have made a mega mover of a groover.&quot;

==Sylvie Vartan version (in French)==
In 1963, the song was adapted into French by Georges Aber as &quot;Twiste et chante&quot;, meaning &quot;Twist and sing&quot; and was recorded by French pop singer Sylvie Vartan and was released as the third and final single off of her sophomore album of the same name that October. The song peaked at Number 8 in the French Belgian charts in February 1964. A promotional video was also filmed for the song. Vartan also performed the song on the American variety music program &quot;Shindig!&quot; on March 24, 1965 along with a cover of Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; (in English).

<text>Metrocenter Mall is a defunct shopping mall located in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. The largest enclosed shopping mall in Mississippi, it contained 1,250,000 square feet of retail space on two levels, including four anchor spaces. Regional real estate developer Jim Wilson &amp; Associates built the mall in Mississippi&#x27;s capital city in 1978, as one of its portfolio of properties throughout the southeastern United States. The mall is located near the junction of Interstate 20 and Interstate 220/U.S. Highway 49, along West Jackson&#x27;s U.S. Highway 80 corridor. After years of ownership by Cannon Management and Jackson Metrocenter Limited, a decade-long decline at the mall led to a foreclosure in November 2012, and subsequent sale to Metrocenter Mall, LLC. Though the mall itself is closed, some portions of the mall are used as City of Jackson offices, including the former Belk anchor store. There are 2 other vacant anchor stores that were once Sears and Dillard&#x27;s.

==History==
When Metrocenter opened March 1, 1978, it was considered to be the largest mall in Mississippi with over 100 services and stores on two levels. The mall opened with three anchor department stores, Jackson-based McRae&#x27;s, Alabama-based Gayfers, and national retailer Sears. New Orleans–based D.H. Holmes was added as the fourth department store anchor in May 1979. Restaurants were inside two of the department stores — Potpourri Restaurant inside D.H. Holmes, and Widow Watson&#x27;s inside McRae&#x27;s. Metrocenter also had a Service Merchandise, a specialty outlet of the Jackson-based Jitney-Jungle supermarket chain, and Mississippi&#x27;s only General Cinema theater as outparcels, and took away most of the business of Jackson Mall, which opened in 1969 with JCPenney, Gayfers, and Woolco as its anchors, in North Jackson. Metrocenter continued to enjoy success after Northpark Mall opened north of the county line in Ridgeland in 1984.

==Former anchors==
D.H. Holmes was acquired by and converted to Arkansas-based Dillard&#x27;s in 1989, bringing with it the closure of the Potpourri Restaurant. A decade later, Dillard&#x27;s acquired Gayfers by way of a buyout of its parent Mercantile Stores in 1999. McRae&#x27;s was sold in 2006, and its Metrocenter store rebranded to Belk that year. Sears was the only original anchor to remain until its closure.

==Decline and closure==
Metrocenter began to decline in 1999, when the first of the mall&#x27;s anchor department stores closed. Dillard&#x27;s, which had acquired two of the mall&#x27;s anchor spaces by 1999, continued to operate in the former D.H. Holmes space while closing the Gayfer&#x27;s space. Dillard&#x27;s remained in the mall until 2006, leaving two active department store anchors at Metrocenter. Within the same year, one of those anchors—McRae&#x27;s—was sold to Belk, which assumed the anchor and rebranded the store&#x27;s restaurant as Brittyanna&#x27;s. A steady pattern of vacancies continued until August 2007, when Burlington Coat Factory opened in the first level of the former Gayfers property to great fanfare, drawing patrons from more than 90 miles away. Statistics show traffic had increased at Metrocenter by as much as 3,000 cars per day.

Despite the addition, changing demographics in the Jackson metropolitan area contributed to substantial vacancies. By June 2009, Belk announced its intent to close the company&#x27;s Metrocenter&#x27;s location in August, in order to focus on suburban properties at Ridgeland&#x27;s Northpark Mall and Flowood’s Dogwood Festival Market.

The year&#x27;s end brought a 6–1 vote during a December 2009 meeting of Jackson&#x27;s city council, to purchase the former D.H. Holmes/Dillard&#x27;s property for $39,500, in hopes of spurring a revitalization of West Jackson.

The former McRae&#x27;s/Belk property was sold in July 2010 to Retro Metro, LLC, with plans to divide the one-time anchor between offices for the City of Jackson on the first level, and a mixed-use redevelopment in the second level that included offices, restaurants, and retail space. Watkins Partners, a Jackson-area real estate developer, announced intentions to move forward with Project Retro Metro in December 2010 and started with its mixed-use redevelopment in January 2011. David Watkins, president of Watkins Partners, said, &quot;Metrocenter has plummeted.&quot;

Despite many efforts to redevelop Metrocenter, Sears Holdings announced in late December 2011 that over 100 of its Kmart and Sears properties would close, including the Sears store at Metrocenter. The last of the mall&#x27;s department store anchors, Sears closed in 2012. Presently the only uses of the mall are the Burlington store, City offices, and scattered small outlets around the center court. Special events are still held in the center court as well.

In August 2018, Metrocenter closed its doors though Burlington and parts of the building that hold city offices remained open.

On February 9, 2022, it was announced that Burlington would be closing its doors at this location, making the mall of void of any retail store.

<doc id="716991" wikidata="Q302946" url="?curid=716991" title="Namoi River">
<text>The Namoi River, a major perennial river that is part of the Barwon catchment of the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes districts of New South Wales, Australia.

The Namoi River rises on the western slopes of the Moonbi Range and Great Dividing Range, near Niangala, at the convergence of the Macdonald River and Boundary Creek, and flows generally west, joined by twenty-seven tributaries, including the Peel, Manilla and Mooki rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Barwon River, near Walgett.

The Namoi River descends over its course; passing near the towns of Gunnedah, Boggabri, Narrabri, Wee Waa and Walgett. The flow of the river is impounded by Lake Keepit and Baraneal Lagoon.

== Course ==

The headwaters of the Namoi, including the Macdonald River, the Peel River, the Cockburn River and the Manilla River, rise on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range on the Northern Tablelands. Other smaller tributaries include Cobrabald River, Coxs Creek, Maules Creek, Mooki River and Bundock Creek. It rises east of Niangala and flows generally north west after its confluence with its major tributary, the Cobrabald River, then passes through the villages of Woolbrook and Bendemeer. It continues to flow westward to where it changes name to the Namoi River at Boundary Creek just east of where the river enters Warrabah National Park.

The Namoi flows past Manilla, where it is joined by the Manilla River. After passing into Keepit Dam it is joined by the Peel River before passing by Carroll, then joined by the Mooki River near Gunnedah on the Liverpool Plains. From here it flows north-westwards past Boggabri, Narrabri, Wee Waa and Burren Junction and eventually joins the Barwon River, near the town of Walgett.

Keepit Dam near Gunnedah is an important dam for flood control and irrigation. The floodplains of the lower Namoi around Wee Waa are an important area for growing cotton which is irrigated using water from the dam.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Namoi River are the Aboriginal people of the Kamilaroi nation. The word &quot;namoi&quot; or &quot;nammoy&quot; is believed to be the native name for a species of acacia; and &quot;ngamu&quot; is a Gamilaraay word for &quot;breast&quot;. Alternative meanings of the name include Aboriginal words for &quot;forked stick&quot; and &quot;meeting of the waters&quot;.

Allan Cunningham, a botanist-explorer, in 1827 became the first European to explore the Namoi River. Cunningham named this river &quot;Mitchell&quot; in honour of James Mitchell, the chief surgeon of Sydney Hospital, out of gratitude for his assistance with barometrical observations. 

The Namoi River Road Bridge, which was built at Manilla in 1886, has been placed on the Register of the National Estate. This bridge has eleven metal lattice truss spans and is one of the longest six or seven metal truss bridges completed in Australia by that time.

== Fauna ==
The Namoi supports a wide range of fish and crustaceans, which include Murray cod, yellowbelly, silver perch, catfish (&quot;Tandanus tandanus&quot;) as well as yabbies (&quot;Cherax destructor&quot;). &quot;Crawbob&quot; is a regional name and may be called a &quot;yabby&quot; elsewhere in the state.

Murray cod in the Namoi grow to a very large size, with fish of forty kilograms or larger being not uncommon. European carp and extensive irrigation practices have had adverse impact on the native fish population over the last forty years, and restocking programs have been undertaken, mainly by volunteers, to ensure the survival of the native fish population.

The Namoi River snapping turtle or Bell&#x27;s turtle (&quot;Elseya belli&quot;) is a species of turtle found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi River, Gwydir and Macdonald rivers on the North West Slopes.

The platypus (&quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;) is found in this river and can often be seen around Warrabah National Park, east of Manilla.

<doc id="716994" wikidata="Q1043562" url="?curid=716994" title="Service set (802.11 network)">
<text>In IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networking standards (including Wi‑Fi), a service set is a group of wireless network devices which share a &quot;service set identifier&quot; (&quot;SSID&quot;)—typically the natural language label that users see as a network name. (For example, all of the devices that together form and use a Wi‑Fi network called &quot;Foo&quot; are a service set.) A service set forms a logical network of nodes operating with shared link-layer networking parameters; they form one logical network segment.

A service set is either a &quot;basic service set&quot; (&quot;BSS&quot;) or an &quot;extended service set&quot; (&quot;ESS&quot;). 

A &quot;basic service set&quot; is a subgroup, within a service set, of devices that share physical-layer medium access characteristics (e.g. radio frequency, modulation scheme, security settings) such that they are wirelessly networked. The basic service set is defined by a &quot;basic service set identifier&quot; (&quot;BSSID&quot;) shared by all devices within it. The BSSID is a 48-bit label that conforms to MAC-48 conventions. While a device may have multiple BSSIDs, usually each BSSID is associated with at most one basic service set at a time.

A basic service set should not be confused with the coverage area of an access point, known as the &quot;basic service area&quot; (&quot;BSA&quot;).

==Basic service set types==

===Infrastructure===
An &quot;infrastructure BSS&quot; is created by an infrastructure device called an &quot;access point&quot; (&quot;AP&quot;) for other devices to join. (Note that the term &quot;IBSS&quot; is &quot;not&quot; used for this type of BSS but refers to the &quot;independent&quot; type discussed below.) The operating parameters of the infrastructure BSS are defined by the AP. The Wi‑Fi segments of common home and business networks are examples of this type.

Each basic service set has a unique identifier, a BSSID, which is a 48-bit number that follows MAC address conventions. An infrastructure BSSID is usually non-configurable, in which case it is either preset during manufacture or mathematically derived from a preset value such as a serial number or a MAC address of another network interface. As with the MAC addresses used for Ethernet devices, an infrastructure BSSID is a combination of a 24-bit organizationally unique identifier (OUI, the manufacturer&#x27;s identity) and a 24-bit serial number. A BSSID with a value of all 1s is used to indicate the wildcard BSSID, usable only during probe requests or for communications that take place outside the context of a BSS.

===Independent===
An &quot;independent BSS&quot; (&quot;IBSS&quot;), or &quot;ad hoc network&quot;, is created by peer devices among themselves without network infrastructure. A temporary network created by a cellular telephone to share its Internet access with other devices is a common example. In contrast to the stations in an infrastructure-mode network, the stations in a wireless ad hoc network communicate directly with one another, i.e. without a dependence on a distribution point to relay traffic between them. In this form of peer-to-peer wireless networking, the peers form an &quot;independent basic service set&quot; (&quot;IBSS&quot;). Some of the responsibilities of a distribution point—such as defining network parameters and other &quot;beaconing&quot; functions—are established by the first station in an ad-hoc network. However, that station does not relay traffic between the other stations; instead, the peers communicate directly with one another. Like an infrastructure BSS, an independent BSS also has a 48-bit MAC-address-like identifier. But unlike infrastructure BSS identifiers, independent BSS identifiers are not necessarily unique: the &quot;individual/group&quot; bit of the address is always set to 0 (individual), the &quot;universal/local&quot; bit of the address is always set to 1 (local), and the remaining 46 bits are randomly generated.

===Mesh===
A &quot;mesh basic service set&quot; (&quot;MBSS&quot;) is a self-contained network of &quot;mesh stations&quot; that share a &quot;mesh profile&quot;, defined in 802.11s. Each node may also be an access point hosting its own basic service set, for example using the mesh BSS to provide Internet access for local users. In such a system, the BSS created by the access point is distinct from the mesh network, and a wireless client of that BSS is not part of the MBSS. The formation of the mesh BSS, as well as wireless traffic management (including path selection and forwarding) is negotiated between the nodes of the mesh infrastructure. The mesh BSS is distinct from the networks (which may also be wireless) used by a mesh&#x27;s redistribution points to communicate with one another.

==Service set identifier==
The &quot;service set identifier&quot; (&quot;SSID&quot;) defines or extends a service set. Normally it is broadcast in the clear by stations in beacon packets to announce the presence of a network and seen by users as a wireless network name.

Unlike basic service set identifiers, SSIDs are usually customizable. These SSIDs can be zero to 32 octets long, and are, for convenience, usually in a natural language, such as English. The 802.11 standards prior to the 2012 edition did not define any particular encoding or representation for SSIDs, which were expected to be treated and handled as an arbitrary sequence of 0–32 octets that are not limited to printable characters. IEEE Std 802.11-2012 defines a flag to express that the SSID is UTF-8-encoded and could contain any Unicode text. Wireless network stacks must still be prepared to handle all possible values in the SSID field.

Since the contents of an SSID field are arbitrary, the 802.11 standard permits devices to advertise the presence of a wireless network with beacon packets in which the SSID field is set to null. A null SSID (the SSID element&#x27;s codice_1 field is set to zero) is called a &quot;wildcard SSID&quot; in IEEE 802.11 standards documents, and as a &quot;no broadcast SSID&quot; or &quot;hidden SSID&quot; in the context of beacon announcements, and can be used, for example, in enterprise and mesh networks to steer a client to a particular (e.g. less utilized) access point. A station may also likewise transmit packets in which the SSID field is set to null; this prompts an associated access point to send the station a list of supported SSIDs. Once a device has associated with a basic service set, for efficiency, the SSID is not sent within packet headers; only BSSIDs are used for addressing.

Apple&#x27;s location services interpret the SSID of a Wi‑Fi access point ending in &lt;samp&gt;_nomap&lt;/samp&gt; as an opt-out from being included in Apple&#x27;s crowdsourced location databases.

==Extended service set==
An &quot;extended service set&quot; (&quot;ESS&quot;) is a wireless network, created by multiple access points, which appears to users as a single, seamless network, such as a network covering a home or office that is too large for reliable coverage by a single access point. It is a set of one or more infrastructure basic service sets on a common logical network segment (i.e. same IP subnet and VLAN). Key to the concept is that the participating basic service sets appear as a single network to the logical link control layer by using the same SSID. Thus, from the perspective of the logical link control layer, stations within an ESS may communicate with one another, and mobile stations may move transparently from one participating basic service set to another (within the same ESS). Extended service sets make possible distribution services such as centralized authentication. From the perspective of the link layer, all stations within an ESS are all on the same link, and transfer from one BSS to another is transparent to logical link control.

The basic service sets formed in wireless ad hoc networks are, by definition, independent from other BSSs, and an independent BSS cannot therefore be part of an extended infrastructure. In that formal sense an independent BSS has no extended service set. However, the network packets of both independent BSSs and infrastructure BSSs have a logical network service set identifier, and the logical link control does not distinguish between the use of that field to name an ESS network, and the use of that field to name a peer-to-peer ad hoc network. The two are effectively indistinguishable at the logical link control layer level.

<doc id="717001" wikidata="Q1794394" url="?curid=717001" title="Lake Alexandrina (South Australia)">
<text>Lake Alexandrina is a coastal freshwater lake located between the Fleurieu and Kangaroo Island and Murray and Mallee regions of South Australia, about south-east of Adelaide. The lake adjoins the smaller Lake Albert (together known as the Lower Lakes) and a coastal lagoon called The Coorong to its southeast, before draining into the Great Australian Bight via a short, narrow opening known as Murray Mouth.

==Nomenclature==
===Aboriginal naming===
Aboriginal people having an association with the lake were reported as knowing it by such names as &quot;Mungkuli,&quot; &quot;Parnka&quot; and &quot;Kayinga.&quot;

===European naming===
English settlers named the lake after Princess Alexandrina, niece and successor of King William IV of Great Britain and Ireland. When the princess ascended the throne and took the name Queen Victoria, there was some talk of changing the name of the lake to Lake Victoria, but the idea was dropped.

==Description==
Lake Alexandrina is located north of Encounter Bay and east of Fleurieu Peninsula within what are now the two following South Australian government regions: Fleurieu and Kangaroo Island region, and the Murray Mallee region. The Murray River is the major river to flow into Lake Alexandrina. Others include the Bremer, Angas, and Finniss rivers, all from the eastern side of the southern Mount Lofty Ranges. The lake is shallow and contains a number of islands near the southern end. Loveday Bay is an inlet located at the south-east of Lake Alexandrina, adjacent to Tauwitchere Channel. Lake Alexandrina is connected by a narrow channel to the smaller Lake Albert to the south-east.

The lake empties into the Southern Ocean via a channel known as the Murray Mouth, south-east of the town of Goolwa, but when the river flow is low, the mouth is often blocked by a sand-bar. Originally subjected to tidal and storm inflows of seawater, the lake is now maintained as a fresh water one by a series of barrages known as the Goolwa Barrages; these cross five channels between the mainland and three islands near the Murray Mouth.

Though the lake has been historically connected to the ocean, the fresh and salt water flows mixed very little, with the lake area remaining fresh over 95% of the time with normal river inflow. Salt water inflows from the ocean would result in relatively little mixing of fresh and salt water, either vertically in the water column or laterally across the flow stream.
A 2020 review of hundreds of scientific studies relating to the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth has found that it was a freshwater ecosystem prior to European settlement of South Australia.

Hindmarsh Island is reputed to be the largest island in the world with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other.

==History==
In Aboriginal mythology known as the Dreaming, the lake was inhabited by a monster known as the &quot;Muldjewangk&quot;.

Edward Wilson, visiting the lake in the 1850s described it as follows: &quot;Lake Alexandrina is the finest sheet of fresh water I ever saw. Indeed so formidable did it look, with a stiff wind blowing up quite a sufficient swell to make one seasick, that I could scarcely believe it to be fresh. Such is the fact however. It is forty or fifty miles long by twelve or fifteen wide and the shores around it receded into the dim distance until they become invisible, in the way which we are accustomed only with ideas of salt water. Supplied almost entirely by the Murray, the whole lake retains the muddy tinge of which I have spoken, and this sadly detracts from the otherwise beautiful appearances of this magnificent sheet of water.&quot;

The Point McLeay mission was established by George Taplin on the shore of the lake in 1859 and became an Aboriginal reserve in 1916. It was handed back to the Ngarrindjeri people in 1974, and renamed Raukkan in 1982. Inventor and author David Unaipon is from Raukkan.

In 2008, water levels in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert became so low that there was a high risk of large quantities of acid sulphate soils forming. The soils on the lake beds are naturally rich in iron sulphides. When exposed to the air, such as may occur in a time of severe drought, the sulphides oxidise, producing sulphuric acid. The barrages now prevent the seawater inflows that had formerly prevented this phenomenon in every drought since the last ice age. A weir was proposed near Pomanda Point where the river entered the lake, in order to protect upriver and Adelaide&#x27;s water supplies should it become necessary to open the barrages, but this plan was dropped by the South Australian government after a campaign by the River, Lakes and Coorong Action Group highlighted the many environmental problems such a weir would cause.

==Environment==
Turtles live in the lake, with lizards and snakes being present along the shoreline. Insect species include dragonflies, a range of moths and butterflies, and large numbers of beetles (coleoptera). Freshwater fish inhabit the lake, including the introduced European carp. The soils around the lake are relatively low in organic carbon, although good barley and vegetable crops may be produced. Non-wetting soils are present along the south eastern bounds of Lake Albert and in areas around Lake Alexandrina.

===Birds===
The lake is a habitat for many species of waterbird, including migratory waders, or shorebirds, which breed in northern Asia and Alaska. Species supported by the lake include the critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, endangered Australasian bitterns, vulnerable fairy terns, as well as over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, Australian shelducks, great cormorants and sharp-tailed sandpipers.

==Protected area status==
===Australian government===
Lake Alexandrina is part of the wetland complex known as the Coorong and Lakes Alexandrina and Albert Wetland which is listed as a Ramsar site. The wetland is also appears in the non-statutory list known as &quot;A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia&quot;.

===South Australian government===
Lake Alexandrina includes the following protected areas declared under the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot; - Currency Creek Game Reserve, Mud Islands Game Reserve, Salt Lagoon Islands Conservation Park and Tolderol Game Reserve.

===Non-statutory arrangements===
Lake Alexandrina is included within the boundary of the Lakes Alexandrina and Albert Important Bird Area which is an area considered by BirdLife International to be a place of ‘international significance for the conservation of birds and other biodiversity.’

<doc id="717005" wikidata="Q988010" url="?curid=717005" title="Tailem Bend, South Australia">
<text>Tailem Bend (locally, &quot;Tailem&quot;) is a rural town in South Australia, south-east of the state capital of Adelaide. It is located on the lower reaches of the River Murray, near where the river flows into Lake Alexandrina. It is linear in layout since it is constrained by river cliffs on its western side and the Adelaide–Melbourne railway line is dominant on its eastern side. The town grew and consolidated through being a large railway centre between the 1890s and 1990s; now it continues to service regional rural communities. In the , Tailem Bend and the surrounding area had a population of 1,705. 

== History ==
Prior to European settlement the area was inhabited for millennia by the indigenous Ngarrindjeri people, who made bark and reed canoes and lived on fish and animals dependent on the River Murray. Once written as &quot;Tail&#x27;em Bend&quot;, the town&#x27;s name is the Ngarrindjeri word &quot;thelim&quot;, meaning &quot;bend&quot;, referring to the sharp bend that the river makes in this location. An alternative explanation is that this part of the river was &quot;Thelum Ki&quot;, meaning &quot;bent water&quot;.

In 1884, while building the railway line eastwards to the colony of Victoria, a track-laying gang set up camp among some native pine trees and named their site &quot;Pine Camp&quot;. A township grew from there. In 1887, the year after the railway opened for traffic, &quot;Tailem Bend&quot; was proclaimed. 

== Industry ==
Major industries in the area include pig farming, dairying, and growing grains, hay and olives. The head office of Coorong District Council is situated in the town. The Tailem Bend Solar Power Farm and The Bend Motorsport Park, respectively and south-east of the town, are significant recent additions to the region&#x27;s economy. 

The Tailem Bend railway centre was a large employer for much of the 20th century, providing refuelling, servicing and maintenance facilities for trains on the interstate railway line and rural lines radiating into the Murraylands to the north-east. The steep grades and sharp curves of the Mount Lofty Ranges towards Adelaide required steam locomotives with power at slow speeds; for the relatively straight and flat interstate line to the Victorian border, fast, large-wheeled locomotives were needed. In 1926, expanded facilities were opened, including a large roundhouse, as part of the reforms initiated by the South Australian Railways Commissioner William Webb. Diesel-electric locomotives introduced in the 1950s had wider power and speed ranges, and longer distances between refuelling, reducing the need for the facilities, and when government ownership of the railways gave way at the turn of the century to private operating companies running non-stop interstate freight trains, most of the facilities were demolished. However, a locomotive and rolling stock reconditioning company operated from the remaining premises.

== Transport ==
Tailem Bend is on Australia&#x27;s principal highway, the A1, linking Adelaide and Melbourne; it is from the end of the South Eastern Freeway to Adelaide. South of the town is the junction between the Princes and Dukes Highways. It is, however, a stopping place for interstate bus services. The Tailem Bend Ferry, a cable ferry, operates across the River Murray to Jervois.

The Adelaide-Melbourne railway passes through the town but the freight trains do not stop. Until 1999, The Overland train served Tailem Bend. A couple of broad gauge wheat-haulage country railway lines branched off at Tailem Bend to the towns of Moorook, Barmera, Waikerie, Peebinga, Loxton and Pinnaroo. These lines were progressively closed down in the 1970s, 80s and 90s due to a decline in rail transport and increase in road transport. The last of these lines were the Loxton railway line and Pinnaroo railway line which closed in July 2015.


From Tailem Bend south-eastwards, the Dukes Highway is a direct route to Melbourne; the Princes Highway runs along the Coorong and coast towards Melbourne, and the Mallee Highway east towards Sydney. There is also a road connecting to the Karoonda Highway leading to Loxton and the Riverland. Tailem Bend is a common stopping point for truck drivers travelling to and/or from Adelaide, as there are no fuel or food outlets with truck facilities on the South Eastern Freeway.

== The Bend motorsport park ==
Since 2018, when the first Supercars Championship race meeting was held, The Bend Motorsport Park has operated a racing track rated by Formula One winner Mark Webber as world-class.

<doc id="717008" wikidata="Q4857306" url="?curid=717008" title="Banu Lakhm">
<text>The Banu Lakhm () was an Arab tribe best known for its ruling Nasrid, or more commonly, &#x27;Lakhmid&#x27;, house, which ruled as the Sasanian Empire&#x27;s vassal kings in the buffer zone with the nomadic Arab tribes of northern and eastern Arabia in the 4th—6th centuries CE from their seat in al-Hirah in modern Iraq. After their first ruler Amr ibn Adi ibn Nasr (), nothing was mentioned of the Lakhmid kings in Iraq until the late 5th century when they emerged as commanders of Sasanian campaigns against nomadic Arab tribes and later the Arab allies of the Byzantine Empire. Their origin is thought to be Yemenite.

A section of the Lakhm dwelt in Syria at least from the 4th century, during Byzantine rule, and remained allies of Byzantium until the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s. Thereafter, they became one the main tribes that made up the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s Arab tribal soldiery in Palestine and were closely associated with the larger tribe of Judham.

==Iraq==
The Lakhm is best known for its Nasrid, or more commonly &#x27;Lakhmid&#x27;, house, which ruled a vassal kingdom of the Persian Sasanian Empire in the 4th–6th centuries from its capital in al-Hira in Iraq (lower Mesopotamia). The founder of the Lakhmids&#x27; kingdom was Amr ibn Adi ibn Nasr, who is identified as the &#x27;Amr ibn Lakhm&#x27; mentioned in two pre-Islamic inscriptions, one in Pahlavi/Parthian and the other in Coptic. His reign is traditionally dated to CE.

Amr&#x27;s successor, his son Imru al-Qays I ibn Amr, initially ruled over the Arab tribes of the upper Euphrates and the Syrian Desert before converting to Christianity and defecting to the Roman Empire. Little is heard again of the Lakhmids of Iraq until the 5th century. Irfan Shahid suspects this part of the tribe either migrated back to Iraq around that time or had remained there, not accompanying their king Imru al-Qays and the rest of the Lakhm to Syria (see below). 

Lakhmid kings re-emerge in the 5th century as commanders in Sasanian campaigns against the Byzantines, rulers over the Arab tribes of northern Arabia, one-time power players in Sasanian succession politics, and builders of palaces in al-Hira. Lakhmid history in the 6th century was marked by the long reign of king al-Mundhir III (), who helped extend and protect Sasanian influence in southern and western Arabia, and the war with the Byzantines&#x27; Arab vassals, the Ghassanids of Syria. The last Lakhmid king, al-Nu&#x27;man III () embraced Christianity and was assassinated by the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II. This brought an end to the Lakhmid kingdom, which inadvertently removed the Persians&#x27; bulwark against the Arab tribes in the deserts around Iraq and ultimately paved the way for the Arab Muslim conquest of Iraq in the 630s.

==Syria and Palestine==
===Byzantine period===
According to the historians Henri Lammens and Irfan Shahid, the Lakhm&#x27;s arrival to Syria dates to the 4th century, evidencing this on the Namara inscription, the epitaph of Imru al-Qays I ibn Amr found in southern Syria, which is dated to 328 CE.

The Lakhm of Syria dwelt in the southern parts of the region, near and among the tribes of Judham and Amila, though they were probably earlier-established there than both. The three tribes became closely allied and formed fictitious genealogical links, making them &#x27;brother&#x27; tribes. In the period immediately preceding the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s, the older-established Lakhm was exceeded in prominence by the Judham and Amila, especially the former, which practically absorbed the tribe. On the eve of the conquest, the Lakhm lived in groups among the Judham in the region extending north of Tabuk through the desert region east of the Arabah Valley and Dead Sea up to the approaches of the Balqa. Part of the Lakhm also lived in southern Palestine, west of the Dead Sea.

===Early Islamic period===
The Islamic prophet Muhammad established contacts with clans of the Lakhm, but the tribe largely remained Christian and allied to the Christian Byzantine Empire along with the Judham. Both tribes fought on behalf of the Byzantines against the Muslims at the Battle of Mu&#x27;ta in and were targeted, along with other Byzantine-allied Christian Arab tribes, in the Muslim raid on Tabuk in . At least ten men of the Lakhm&#x27;s Banu al-Dar clan, including the famous Tamim al-Dari, conferred with Muhammad in his capital Medina and converted to Islam. To these men of the Banu al-Dar, Muhammad granted lands in southern Palestine, including Hebron and its surroundings, though these lands were under Byzantine control at the time and the grant only took effect after the Muslim conquest. Another clan of the tribe, the Banu Hadas, also refrained from joining the rest of the Lakhm at Mu&#x27;ta, though information about them is sketchy. In general, the bulk of the Lakhm stood with Byzantium.

During the Muslim conquest of Syria, Lakhm tribesmen were counted in the ranks of the Arab tribal fighters led by the Ghassanid chief Jabala ibn al-Ayham in the Byzantine army at the Battle of Yarmouk in 636. Groups of the Lakhm were also counted in the Muslims&#x27; ranks as well. In the assessment of the historian Fred Donner, pre-existing divisions and rivalries within the Lakhm likely explains the participation of Lakhm tribesmen on both the Byzantine and Muslim sides at Yarmouk. The unclear allegiance of the Lakhm and Judham during the conquest is reflected in Caliph Umar&#x27;s order to exclude them from shares in the war spoils around 638, which otherwise were to be equally divided among the Arab tribes in the Muslim ranks. Nonetheless, the Lakhm&#x27;s and Judham&#x27;s presence on the Muslim army&#x27;s pay roles indicates they were incorporated into the Muslim polity by this time.

Throughout the first century of Islamic rule, the Lakhm are almost always counted with the Judham as a single group in the sources. In the Battle of Siffin in 657, which pitted the governor of Syria, Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (), against Caliph Ali (), the Lakhm fought together with the Judham under the same banner and commander, Natil ibn Qays al-Judhami, for Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s side. The same had occurred during the battle of Yarmouk and again when the two fought on behalf of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son, the Umayyad caliph Yazid I, in the Syrian army which suppressed anti-Umayyad rebellions in the Hejaz (Medina and Mecca) in 682–683. 

Along with the Judham, and the tribes of Kinana, Azd Sarat, Khuza&#x27;a, and Khath&#x27;am which arrived with the conquest armies, the Lakhm formed the Arab tribal soldiery of Jund Filastin (military district of Palestine) during the early Islamic period, according to the 9th-century historian Khalifa ibn Khayyat. Another 9th-century historian, al-Ya&#x27;qubi, also names the constituents of the Arab tribes in Palestine as Lakhm, Judham, and Kinana, but omits the others, instead adding the Amila, Kinda, and Qays. The 10th-century historian al-Muhallabi mentions that Rafah, south of Gaza, was dominated by the Lakhm and Judham, though it is not clear which time period he is describing.

While the Lakhm of Syria and Palestine was almost invariably tied with the Judham, their nisba (epithet) continued to evoke honor due to &quot;its archaic flavour, the glorious memories which it recalled&quot; of the kings of al-Hira, according to Lammens. As late as the 9th and 10th centuries, notable figures in Palestine continued to claim descent from the tribe, such as the scholar Sulayman ibn Ahmad al-Tabarani of Tiberias and messianic anti-Abbasid rebel al-Mubarqa.

<text>Morris Stephen Panych (born 30 June 1952) is a Canadian playwright, director and actor.

==Early life==
Panych was born in Calgary, Alberta and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta. He studied at Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, and the University of British Columbia.

==Plays==
*&quot;Co$t of Living&quot; (1991)
*&quot;The Ends of the Earth&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Vigil&quot; (1996) (adapted for the British stage as &quot;Auntie and Me&quot;)

Vigil played at the Belfry Theatre in Victoria, BC (15 November - 11 December 2022) and Panych is described on the playbill as one of Canada&#x27;s &quot;most prolific and idiosyncratic playwrights -- and one of the very best. I love his plays -- and his characters. So many of them approach the world with disdain and skepticism. But despite their best efforts -- they can&#x27;t help finding the good in other people.&quot; This work is best described as a very funny black comedy.

<text>Myall Lakes, a series of fresh water lakes protected under the Ramsar Convention, are located within the Mid-Coast Council local government area in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

The Myall Lakes are adjacent to the east coast, about north of Sydney.

==Features and location==
There are three Myall Lakes, called Myall Lake, Boolambayte Lake and The Broadwater.

When full, Myall Lake covers an area of around ; Boolambayte Lake covers an area of around ; and Bombah Broadwater covers an area of around .

Smiths Lake is close to the northern Myall Lake, but is not connected nor formally part of the Myall Lakes. The lakes are partially interconnected and navigable by small craft. The Myall River flows into the western side of The Broadwater. The Myall River also flows out of The Broadwater and meanders southwest where it empties into Port Stephens between the towns of Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest. The lower Myall River progressively becomes saltier and more tidal as it flows southwards.

Most of the Myall Lakes are surrounded by the Myall Lakes National Park. The NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service operate a car ferry across the lake at Bombah Point. The area between the lakes and the sea is mainly uninhabited coastal woodlands and long isolated beaches although some of it was mined for heavy mineral sands before the 1970s. The village of Bungwahl is located on the northern shore of Myall Lake. There are a number of small islands in the lakes.

At the northern end of Myall Lake lies Mayers Point. This was the centre of a timber industry established by Allen Taylor and Company Limited. To assist in the transport of the logs from the forests to the lake, an extensive light railway system was constructed.

Due to the nature of Myall Lakes being coastal dune lakes, or coastal lagoons, they were featured in an American documentary about conservation done by producer Elam Stoltzfus.

<text>On the World Wide Web, a web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors &quot;syndicate&quot; a web feed, thereby allowing users to &quot;subscribe&quot; a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a &quot;feed reader&quot; or a &quot;news reader&quot;). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus &quot;RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.&quot; 

The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media. Often, when websites provide web feeds to notify users of content updates, they only include summaries in the web feed rather than the full content itself. Many news websites, weblogs, schools and podcasters operate web feeds. As web feeds are designed to be machine-readable rather than human-readable they can also be used to automatically transfer information from one website to another without any human intervention.

==Technical definition==
A web feed is a document (often XML-based) whose discrete content items include web links to the source of the content. News websites and blogs are common sources for web feeds, but feeds are also used to deliver structured information ranging from weather data to search results. 

Common web feed formats are:

* Atom
* JSON Feed
* RSS

Although RSS formats have evolved since March 1999, the RSS icon (&quot;&quot;) first gained widespread use between 2005 and 2006. The feed icon indicates that a web feed is available. 
The original icon was created by Stephen Horlander, a designer at Mozilla. 
With the prevalence of JSON in Web APIs, a further format, JSON Feed, was defined in 2017.

==History==
Dave Winer published a modified version of the RSS 0.91 specification on the UserLand website, covering how it was being used in his company&#x27;s products and claimed copyright to the document. A few months later, UserLand filed a U.S. trademark registration for RSS, but failed to respond to a USPTO trademark examiner&#x27;s request and the request was rejected in December 2001.

The RSS-DEV Working Group, a project whose members included Guha and representatives of O&#x27;Reilly Media and Moreover, produced RSS 1.0 in December 2000. This new version, which reclaimed the name RDF Site Summary from RSS 0.9, reintroduced support for RDF and added XML namespaces support, adopting elements from standard metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core.

In December 2000, Winer released RSS 0.92
a minor set of changes aside from the introduction of the enclosure element, which permitted audio files to be carried in RSS feeds and helped spark podcasting. He also released drafts of RSS 0.93 and RSS 0.94 that were subsequently withdrawn.

In September 2002, Winer released a major new version of the format, RSS 2.0, that redubbed its initials Really Simple Syndication. RSS 2.0 removed the &quot;type&quot; attribute added in the RSS 0.94 draft and added support for namespaces.

Because neither Winer nor the RSS-DEV Working Group had Netscape&#x27;s involvement, they could not make an official claim on the RSS name or format. This has fueled ongoing controversy in the syndication development community as to which entity was the proper publisher of RSS.

One product of that contentious debate was the creation of an alternative syndication format, Atom, that began in June 2003. The Atom syndication format, whose creation was in part motivated by a desire to get a clean start free of the issues surrounding RSS, has been adopted as .

In July 2003, Winer and UserLand Software assigned the copyright of the RSS 2.0 specification to Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society, where he had just begun a term as a visiting fellow. At the same time, Winer launched the RSS Advisory Board with Brent Simmons and Jon Udell, a group whose purpose was to maintain and publish the specification and answer questions about the format.

In December 2005, the Microsoft Internet Explorer team and
Outlook team announced on their blogs that they were adopting the feed icon first used in the Mozilla Firefox browser , created by Stephen Horlander, a Mozilla Designer. A few months later, Opera Software followed suit. This effectively made the orange square with white radio waves the industry standard for RSS and Atom feeds, replacing the large variety of icons and text that had been used previously to identify syndication data.

In January 2006, Rogers Cadenhead relaunched the RSS Advisory Board without Dave Winer&#x27;s participation, with a stated desire to continue the development of the RSS format and resolve ambiguities. In June 2007, the board revised their version of the specification to confirm that namespaces may extend core elements with namespace attributes, as Microsoft has done in Internet Explorer 7. According to their view, a difference of interpretation left publishers unsure of whether this was permitted or forbidden.

==Comparison to email subscriptions==
Web feeds have some advantages compared to receiving frequently published content via an email:
* Users do not disclose their email address when subscribing to a feed and so are not increasing their exposure to threats associated with email: spam, viruses, phishing and identity theft.
* Users do not have to send an unsubscribe request to stop receiving news. They simply remove the feed from their aggregator.
* The feed items are automatically sorted in that each feed URL has its own sets of entries (unlike an email box where messages must be sorted by user-defined rules and pattern matching).

<doc id="717022" wikidata="Q2575646" url="?curid=717022" title="Qahtanite">
<text>Qahtanite (; ) refers to Arabs who originate from modern-day Yemen. The term &quot;Qahtan&quot; is mentioned in multiple ancient Arabian inscriptions found in Yemen. Arab traditions believe that they are the original Arabs.

In some Judeo-Christian-Islamic traditions such as Jubilees and some Jasherian tales the Qahtanite Arabs descend from Jokshan son of Abraham through Keturah and half brother of Ishmael son of Abraham through Hagar.

==Traditional Arab genealogy==

According to Arab tradition, the Qahtanites are from South Arabia, unlike the Adnanites who are from the north of Arabia descended from Ishmael through Adnan. Arab tradition maintains that a semi-legendary ancestral figure named &quot;Qahtan&quot; and his 24 sons are the progenitors of Yemen who controlled the Arabian Peninsula known as Qahtani.

The genealogists disagree about the pedigree of Qahțān [himself]. Some trace him back to Ismā&#x27;īl b. Ibrāhīm, saying that his [name] was Qahṭān b. al - Hamaysa &#x27; b. Tayman b. Nabt b. Ismā&#x27;īl b. Ibrāhīm. Wahb ibn Munabbih and Hishām b. Muhammad al-Kalbi held this genealogy (as true). Hisham ibn al-Kalbi quoted his father as saying that he had been contemporaneous with [older] scholars and genealogists who traced Qahțān&#x27;s pedigree in this way. Other [genealogists] argue that the [name] was Qahţăn b. &#x27;Abir b. Shalakh. Qahtan with the Yoqtan (Joktan) son of Eber (Hūd) in the Hebrew Bible (Gen. 10:25–29). or genesis 25:2-3 that Qahtan is the similarly named Jokshan son of Abraham and Keturah. 

Among the sons of Qahtan are noteworthy figures like A&#x27;zaal (believed by Arabs to have been the original name of Sana&#x27;a), Hadhramaut and Jurhum whose descendants formed the second Jurhum tribe from which Ishmael learned Arabic. Another son is Ya&#x27;rub, and his son Yashjub is the father of Saba&#x27;. All Yemenite tribes trace their ancestry back to this &quot;Saba&quot;, either through Himyar or Kahlan, his two sons.

The Qahtani people are divided into the two sub-groups of Himyar and Kahlan, who represent the settled Arabs of the south and their nomadic kinsmen (nomads). The Kahlan division of Qahtan consists of four subgroups: the Ta&#x27; or Tayy, the Azd group which invaded Oman, the &#x27;Amila-Judham group of Palestine, and the Hamdan-Madhhij group who mostly remain in Yemen.

The Kahlan branch includes the following tribes: Azd (Aus and Khazraj, Bariq, Ghassan, Khuza&#x27;a and Daws), Hamdan, Khath&#x27;am, Bajila, Madhhij, Murad, Zubaid, Ash&#x27;ar, Lakhm, Tayy (Shammar), and Kinda.

===Pre-Islamic Qahtani migration out of Arabia===
Early Semites who developed civilizations throughout the Ancient Near East gradually relinquished their geopolitical superiority to surrounding cultures and neighboring imperial powers, usually due to either internal turmoil or outside conflict. This climaxed with the arrival of the Babylonians, and subsequently the rivaling Medes and Persians, during the 7th and 6th centuries BCE, respectively. Though the Semites lost geopolitical influence, the Aramaic language emerged as the lingua franca of much of the Near East. However, Aramaic usage declined after the defeat of the Persians and the arrival of the Hellenic armies around 330 BCE.

The Ghassanids (ca. 250 CE) were the last major non-Islamic Semitic migration northward out of Yemen. They revived the Semitic presence in the then Roman-controlled Syria. They initially settled in the Hauran region, eventually spreading to Palestine, and Jordan, briefly securing governorship of Syria away from the Nabataeans.

== After the rise of Islam ==
Between the 7th and 14th centuries, the Qahtanites became involved in the Arab conquests, migrating to the newly conquered territories and intermingling with the local populations. In the Umayyad era, a blood feud broke out between Qahtanites and the Adnanite tribes of Qays, which continued in various forms and degrees till the 19th century in what has become known as the Qays–Yaman rivalry.

<doc id="717024" wikidata="Q1668546" url="?curid=717024" title="Missing man formation">
<text>The missing man formation is an aerial salute performed as part of a flypast of aircraft at a funeral or memorial event, typically in memory of a fallen pilot, a well-known military service member or veteran, or a well-known political figure. The planes fly in a formation with a space where one plane should be, symbolizing the person&#x27;s absence. Though similar formations have occurred as early as World War I, the first flypast in the modern formation of four planes is believed to have occurred in 1931 at the funeral for Charles W. &quot;Speed&quot; Holman.

Missing man formations are also used in motorsport in memory of a recently deceased driver, and in American football and ice hockey in memory of a recently deceased player.

== Description ==

Several variants of the formation are seen. The formation most commonly used in the United States is based on the &quot;finger-four&quot; aircraft combat formation composed of two pairs of aircraft. The aircraft fly in a V-shape with the flight leader at the point and their wingman on their left. The second element leader and his wingman fly on the right. The formation flies over the ceremony low enough to be clearly seen and the second element leader abruptly pulls up out of the formation while the rest of the formation continues in level flight until all aircraft are out of sight.

In an older variant, the formation is flown with the second element leader position conspicuously empty. In another variation, the flight approaches from the south, preferably near sundown, and one of the aircraft will suddenly split off to the west, flying into the sunset. In all cases, the aircraft performing the pull-up, split off, or missing from the formation is honoring the person (or persons) who has died, and is representing their departure.

==In memorials==

Permanent memorial sculptures depicting the missing man aerial formation exist at Randolph Air Force Base (&quot;Missing Man Monument&quot;, 1977, Mark Pritchett) in San Antonio, Texas, Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam (&quot;Missing Man Memorial&quot;, 1995) in Honolulu, Hawaii, and Valor Park (&quot;Missing Man Formation&quot;, 2000) near the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

Outside the United States, a missing man memorial was dedicated at the Militaire Luchtvaart Museum (&quot;&quot;, 2004, Leendert Verboom) near Soesterberg Air Base to commemorate the 21 June 1944 crash of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator &quot;Connie&quot; following a bombing raid in Germany; it was moved to the museum near Rijsenhout in 2014.

<doc id="717028" wikidata="Q251365" url="?curid=717028" title="Álvaro Siza Vieira">
<text>Álvaro Joaquim de Melo Siza Vieira (born 25 June 1933) is a Portuguese architect, and architectural educator. He is internationally known as Álvaro Siza () and in Portugal as Siza Vieira ().

==Early life and education==
Siza was born in Matosinhos, a small coastal town near Porto. He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, the current FAUP – &quot;Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto&quot;. There he met his wife, Maria Antónia Siza (1940–1973), with whom he had a daughter and son.

==Career==
Siza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before completing his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with Fernando Távora, he soon became one of the most notable faculty member of the Porto School of Architecture, where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is Eduardo Souto de Moura, e.g. on Portugal&#x27;s flagship pavilions at Expo &#x27;98 in Lisbon and Expo 2000 in Hannover, as well as on the Serpentine Pavillon 2005. Siza&#x27;s work is often described as &quot;poetic modernism&quot;; he himself has contributed to publications on Luis Barragán.

Among Siza&#x27;s earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named Piscinas de Marés) he created in the 1960s for Leça da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea. In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of Évora commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (&quot;Serviço de Apoio Ambulatório Local&quot;), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards. He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988.

Most of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the Faculty of Architecture (1987–93), and the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art (1997). Since the mid-1970s, Siza has been involved in numerous designs for public housing, public pools, and universities. Between 1995 and 2009, Siza has been working on an architecture museum on Hombroich island, completed in collaboration with Rudolf Finsterwalder. Most recently, he started coordinating the rehabilitation of the monuments and architectonic heritage of Cidade Velha (Old Village) in Santiago, an island of Cape Verde.

Commissioned after winning an international competition in 2010, Siza and Granada-based Juan Domingo Santos unveiled designs for a new entrance and visitors center at the Alhambra in 2014.

By 2012, Siza warned that he might close his Portuguese office because of a lack of contracts.

In 2014, Álvaro Siza designed, with Carlos Castanheira the Building on the Water in Huai&#x27;An City, Jiangsu, China that was awarded the building of the year 2015 by ArchDaily.

In 2019, Álvaro Siza was commissioned with his first project in the United States, a 450-foot-tall, 37-story apartment building at 611 West 56th Street in Manhattan.

In 2020, Álvaro Siza designed four buildings respectively Siza House, YuChia House, Tea House and Gate House at the Taifong Golf Club, in Changhua, Taiwan.

===Teaching===
Siza taught at FAUP from 1966 to 1969, returning in 1976. In addition to his teaching there, he has been a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; the University of Pennsylvania; Los Andes University of Bogota; and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

==Legacy==
In July 2014 Siza announced his decision to donate the large part of his architectural archive to the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in order to make his materials &quot;accessible alongside the work of other modern and contemporary architects&quot;, while also giving specific project archives to the Fundação Gulbenkian in Lisbon and Fundação de Serralves in Porto, Portugal.

==Recognition==

In 1987, the dean of Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, organized the first show of Siza&#x27;s work in the United States. In 1992, he was awarded with the renowned Pritzker Prize for the renovation project that he coordinated in the Chiado area of Lisbon, a historic commercial sector that was all but completely destroyed by fire in August 1988.

Other prizes include: The Golden Medal of The Superior Council of Architecture of the College of Architects of Madrid in 1988; Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture, the Prince of Wales Prize in Urban Design from Harvard University, and the Alvar Aalto Medal in 1988; Portugal&#x27;s National Prize of Architecture 1993; the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Praemium Imperiale in 1998, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2001, the Urbanism Special Grand Prize of France 2005.

Siza&#x27;s Iberê Camargo Foundation in Porto Alegre, his first project built in Brazilian territory, was honoured by the Venice Architecture Biennale with the Golden Lion award in 2002. In 2007 the Brazilian Government awarded him the Cultural Merit Order Medal. More recently he was awarded the RIBA&#x27;s 2009 Royal Gold Medal and the International Union of Architects&#x27; 2011 Gold Medal. Siza was awarded by the Venice Architecture Biennale (13th Edition) with the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2012). In 2019 was awarded the National Architecture Award of Spain, being the first non-Spanish architect to receive it in its 90 years of history.

Siza was conferred the title of Honoris Causa Doctor by the following universities: Polytechnic University of Valencia; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne; University of Palermo; University Menendez Pelayo, in Santander; Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería in Lima, Peru; University of Coimbra; Lusíada University of Porto; Universidade Federal de Paraíba; the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Polo delle Scienze e delle Tecnologie, in Naples; the University of Architecture and Urbanism of Bucharest &quot;Ion Mincu&quot;, Romania (2005); and the University of Pavia, Italy (2007). He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, the American Institute of Architects, the &quot;Académie d&#x27;Architecture de France&quot; and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.

<text>Port Stephens, an open youthful tide-dominated drowned-valley estuary, is a large natural harbour of approximately located in the Hunter and Mid North Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia.

Port Stephens lies within the Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park and is situated about north-east of Sydney. The harbour lies wholly within the local government area of Port Stephens; although its northern shoreline forms the boundary between the Port Stephens and MidCoast local government areas.

According to the 2006 census, more than people lived within of its long shoreline and more than lived within .

==Geography==
Port Stephens is formed through the confluence of the Myall and Karuah rivers, Tilligerry Creek, and the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean. The lower port has a predominantly marine ecology and the upper port an estuarine ecology. The area to the east of Port Stephens comprises the Tomago/Tomaree/Stockton sand beds.

A narrow entrance between two striking hills of volcanic origin marks the opening of Port Stephens to the sea. The southern headland, &quot;Tomaree&quot; or South Head, rises to above mean sea level (AMSL) while &quot;Yacaaba&quot;, the northern headland, is AMSL. The harbour is mostly shallow and sandy but contains sufficient deep water to accommodate large vessels. After its recovery from the wreck site in 1974 the bow of the , a Norwegian bulk carrier that was shipwrecked on Stockton Beach earlier that year, was moored in Port Stephens, at Salamander Bay, for almost two years.

With an area of approximately , Port Stephens is larger than Sydney Harbour. Port Stephens extends approximately inland from the Tasman Sea and at its widest point, between Tanilba Bay and Tahlee, it is across. The narrowest point is between Soldiers Point and Pindimar where the distance is only . Between Nelson Bay and Tea Gardens, in the most well known section of the port, it is wide.

The Karuah River drains into Port Stephens at its north-western corner. The Myall River (through the Myall Lakes) drains into the port on its northern shore, about from the mouth of the port. Twelve Mile Creek drains into the port&#x27;s south-western corner.

The southern shore of the port is divided into two distinct areas known as the Tomaree and Tilligerry peninsulas. These are separated by Tilligerry Creek, a watercourse covering approximately , which drains the land in the low-lying areas of Salt Ash, Bobs Farm, Tanilba Bay and Mallabula. While the Tilligerry Peninsula is geographically closer to major centres such as Sydney and Newcastle, it lacks the urban development that has occurred on the much larger ( vs respectively) Tomaree peninsula. Although Lemon Tree Passage, on the Tilligerry Peninsula, and Soldiers Point, on the Tomaree Peninsula, are only from each other, physical separation of the suburbs by Port Stephens and Tilligerry Creek results in them being almost from each other by road.

The town of Karuah, located at the north-western corner of the port near the mouth of the Karuah River, experiences similar geographical separation from the Tilligerry Peninsula. Despite being only from Tanilba Bay, the road distance between the two suburbs is .

The western shore and the western part of the northern shore of the port are largely undeveloped with the flora ranging from scrubland in the west to the large tracts of bushland which are present along most of the northern shore. Closer to the mouth of the port, at and near Winda Woppa, sandy beaches are prevalent. These extend from Jimmys Beach, near the mouth of the port, to the mouth of the Myall River, a distance of approximately . Just outside the mouth of the port lie the two small insular nature reserves of Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island, both dedicated to the conservation of the threatened Gould&#x27;s petrel, and with no public access.

==History==
The Worimi are the traditional owners for the area which is now called Port Stephens and the wider region is home to numerous sites of deep cultural significance to the Worimi.

The port was named by Captain Cook when he passed by on 11 May 1770, honouring Sir Philip Stephens, who was Secretary to the Admiralty. Stephens was a personal friend of Cook and had recommended him for command of the voyage. It seems Cook&#x27;s initial choice had actually been Point Keppel and Keppel Bay, but instead he used Keppel Bay later.

The first ship to enter the port was the &quot;Salamander&quot;, a ship of the Third Fleet that later gave the suburb of Salamander Bay its name, in 1791. In that same year escaped convicts, then known as &#x27;bolters&#x27;, discovered coal in the area.

In 1795 the crew of discovered a group of escaped convicts living with the Worimi people. Port Stephens became a popular haven for escaped convicts and so in 1820 a garrison of soldiers was established at what is now known as Soldiers Point.

The cutter &quot;Lambton&quot;, commanded by Captain James Corlette, began shipping timber and wool out of the port in 1816. The suburb of Corlette was named after the captain.

Port Stephens has rather poor soil for the most part, and has limited agricultural potential. For this reason, no large towns developed there historically and it was never developed as a significant port. The major city and port of Newcastle developed at the mouth of the Hunter River, about south-west of Port Stephens.
Despite this, in 1920 there was a push for Port Stephens to be the capital city of a new state in a proposal originating from the country newspaper &quot;The Daily Observer&quot;. The proposal was the &quot;Observer&quot;&#x27;s editor Victor Thompson&#x27;s idea in response to continuing rural Australian antipathy at the Sydney-centralised funding and governance that many rural newspapers claimed had neglected to aid rural Australian towns.

During World War II, the remoteness and lack of any significant civilian population led to the Royal Australian Navy establishing HMAS &quot;Assault&quot;, an amphibious landing training establishment, at Nelson Bay. The sick bay from HMAS &quot;Assault&quot; still stands and is used by the Port Stephens Community Arts Centre.

A number of small towns developed around the port as fishing, holiday and retirement communities. Since the 1970s, with improved road access from Sydney, and the increasing popularity of coastal retirement lifestyles, there has been major expansion of these towns.

===Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park===
On 1 December 2005 the Port Stephens–Great Lakes Marine Park was established pursuant to the . The park comprises approximately and includes all of Port Stephens, the Karuah and Myall rivers and all their creeks and tributaries under tidal influence. The park was established to protect the wide variety of sea life that inhabit the port and nearby coastal areas of the Tasman Sea from just south of Forster to the northern end of Stockton Beach.
==Demographics==

At the time of the 2006 census, more than 85% of the population around Port Stephens resided in towns and suburbs that have developed on or near the southern shores of the port. More than 22,188 people live within of the port in the suburbs of Corlette, Lemon Tree Passage, Mallabula, Nelson Bay, Oyster Cove, Salamander Bay, Shoal Bay, Soldiers Point, Tanilba Bay and Taylors Beach. Another 5,343 people live in other suburbs on the Tomaree peninsula that are within of Port Stephens. These suburbs include Anna Bay, Boat Harbour, Bobs Farm, Fingal Bay, Fishermans Bay and One Mile.

Most urban development to the south of Port Stephens has occurred on the Tomaree peninsula in the suburbs of Corlette, Nelson Bay, Salamander Bay, Shoal Bay and Soldiers Point.

On the western shore is the suburb of Swan Bay, a small community of around 100 persons. The main industry in the area is oyster farming, however a small tourist resort is located near the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek. Karuah township, which has a population of 857, is at the north-western corner of the port, at the mouth of the Karuah River.

East of the Karuah River, in the Mid-Coast Council local government area there are 3,584 people living in Bundabah, Carrington, Hawks Nest, North Arm Cove, Pindimar, Tahlee and Tea Gardens.

==Tourism and recreation==
Port Stephens is a popular tourism destination with a strong focus on aquatic activities such as whale and dolphin watching, fishing and recreational boating and swimming.

==Notes==

# Although of Anna Bay&#x27;s shoreline actually touches Port Stephens near Taylor&#x27;s Beach, none of its residents live in this area. The vast majority of Anna Bay residents live close to the Tasman Sea shoreline, well away from Port Stephens, although there is a small community living near the border between Anna Bay and Taylor&#x27;s Beach.

<text>The Football Writers&#x27; Association (FWA) is an association of football journalists and correspondents writing for English newspapers and agencies. It presents the Footballer of the Year Award, the oldest and most distinguished award given in the domestic game. In 2018, recognising the growth of the woman&#x27;s game, it announced a Woman&#x27;s Footballer of the Year Award.

==History==
The choice to create the Football Writers&#x27; Association (FWA) was made on 22 September 1947 by journalists, Charles Buchan (News Chronicle), Frank Coles (Daily Telegraph), Roy Peskett (Daily Mail), and Archie Quick while aboard a boat in the middle of the English Channel that was returning from a football match in which England beat Belgium 5–2. 
Ivan Sharpe of the Sunday Chronicle was appointed chairman a month later, a position he held for the first six years of the FWA&#x27;s existence and eight times in all in his long career.
The men formalized a few of the newborn association&#x27;s rules and regulations within one month. Some of the rules initially created were that membership to the FWA would be invitation only and that they would exclusively send invitations to &quot;working journalists who are accredited football correspondents for newspapers and agencies.&quot; It was also determined that the Football Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s headquarters would be in London, England and the membership fee would be five guineas for the first year of membership with a recurring annual payment of two guineas each year after. Furthermore, the men had decided that there would be a vote held annually for all members that would decide the recipient of the prestigious Footballer of the Year Award, which is still today the oldest and most distinguished award given in the domestic game. The award was originally presented at the annual dinner, which was held on the night before the FA Cup Final, but was later changed to the Thursday preceding every FA Cup Final.
To mark the FWA&#x27;s 70th anniversary newly created Life Members of the association will now receive the Ivan Sharpe Life Membership Award, while in 2018, the FWA announced it was awarding a Woman&#x27;s Footballer of the Year award in recognition of the growth of the woman&#x27;s game in this country.

==The Football Writers&#x27; Association today==
The FWA has experienced steady growth since its inception in 1947. Membership has grown to about four-hundred members. Changes in modern journalism have welcomed a more diverse range of members. In recent years, the association has modernized itself by changing the voting process for Footballer of the Year by making online voting available to its members as well as incorporating social media into its revamped web site. The Football Writers&#x27; Association continues to recruit new members openly in the same manner as was created by its founders in 1947. On 24 April 2019, beIN Sports senior sports correspondent Carrie Brown was announced as the first female chair of the FWA.

==The FWA Footballer of the Year Award==
Charles Buchan, one of the founding fathers of the FWA, had originally suggested that there be an award presented &quot;to the professional player who by precept and example is considered by a ballot of members to be the footballer of the year.&quot; The award is the oldest and is considered to be the most prestigious award in British football. The award is presented annually. The first player to receive the award was Sir Stanley Matthews in 1948. In 2018 the FWA introduced their award for the Woman Footballer of the Year in recognition of the growth of the woman&#x27;s game.

===Winners===
The award has been presented on 71 occasions as of 2018, with 63 different winners. On one occasion two players shared the award for a season (1968–69). The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major &quot;player of the year&quot; awards in English football, namely the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year award (PPY), Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award (FPY), and Young Player of the Year award (YPY).




==The FWA Women&#x27;s Footballer of the Year Award==
In 2018, the FWA introduced their award for the Woman Footballer of the Year in recognition of the growth of the women&#x27;s game.The award has been presented on one occasion as of 2018, with one winner. The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major &quot;player of the year&quot; awards in English football, namely the PFA Women&#x27;s Players&#x27; Player of the Year award (PPY), and the PFA Women&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award (YPY).

==The FWA Tribute Award==

The Football Writers&#x27; Association Tribute Award is presented annually every January at the Savoy Hotel to the individual that the committee believes to have contributed to the national game in a significant way. The award was first given in 1983 to Ron Greenwood.

<doc id="717037" wikidata="Q4526152" url="?curid=717037" title="Bill Nye the Science Guy">
<text>Bill Nye the Science Guy is an American science education television program created by Bill Nye, James McKenna, and Erren Gottlieb, with Nye starring as a fictionalized version of himself. It was produced by Seattle public television station KCTS and McKenna/Gottlieb Producers, and distributed by Buena Vista Television with substantial financing from the National Science Foundation.

The show aired in syndication from September 10, 1993, to February 5, 1999, producing a total of six seasons and 100 episodes; beginning with its second season, a concurrent run of the series began airing on PBS from October 10, 1994, and ran until September 3, 1999, as it continued to be distributed in commercial first-run syndication. After the show&#x27;s first run was completed, Nye continued to portray the Science Guy character for a number of short interstitial segments for the Noggin cable channel that aired during reruns of the show. A video game based on the series was released in 1996, and a subsequent television show aimed at adults, &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot;, ran from 2017 to 2018 on Netflix.

Known for its quirky humor and rapid-fire MTV-style pacing, the show was critically acclaimed and was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards, winning 19. Studies also found that people that viewed &quot;Bill Nye&quot; regularly were better able to generate explanations and extensions of scientific ideas than non-viewers.

==Format==
Nye portrays a hyper-kinetic, tall, and slender scientist wearing a blue lab coat and a bow-tie. He combines the serious science of everyday things with fast-paced action and humor. Each half-hour show begins with a cold open, where Nye introduces the episode&#x27;s theme, which leads into an opening credit sequence, and featuring Nye in a computer-animated scientific world, along with his head spinning, radio frequencies, and plastic toy dinosaurs flying. In later seasons, the theme song was cut short by a static screen. After the opening credits (in most episodes), announcer Pat Cashman says &quot;Brought to you by...&quot;, in which a product name is related to the episode&#x27;s theme. Nye walks onto the set, which is called &quot;Nye Laboratories&quot;, filled with scientific visuals including many &quot;of science&quot; contraptions announced dramatically, relevant to the theme of the episode. Science-related TV and movie parodies configure the facts of the episode&#x27;s theme, along with parodies of TV commercials. The show has featured many guest appearances. Each episode features Nye visiting many places relating to the episode&#x27;s theme, showing interviews of people talking about their work and other contributions. At the end of each episode, Nye thanks the viewers for watching, before explaining in a clever description of a theme&#x27;s activity. The closing credits roll over bloopers from the episode.

==History==
===Origins and creation===
Bill Nye was originally an engineer for the 747 airliner at Boeing, having moved to Seattle in 1977 after he was accepted for the position. Nye began to perform stand-up comedy in his spare time after he entered and won a Steve Martin lookalike contest at a comedy club, which led to him meeting fellow comedians Ross Shafer and John Keister. Nye eventually left Boeing in 1985 to join Shafer and Keister in writing and performing for &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, a then-fledgling sketch comedy television show produced by local NBC affiliate KING-TV. During his tenure on the show, Nye began cultivating a science-explaining TV persona; the first instance of the persona occurred in 1985 when Nye called Shafer on-air to correct his pronunciation of the word &quot;gigawatt&quot;, to which Shafer retorted, &quot;Who do you think you are – Bill Nye the Science Guy?&quot; As a result, Nye was subsequently asked to give scientific answers to the show&#x27;s call-in questions. His persona&#x27;s first on-air appearance, as it is contemporarily known, occurred on January 8, 1987, by circumstance when the primary guest for that night&#x27;s performance of &quot;Almost Live!&quot; called in to cancel their appearance; with no backup guest planned to fill the resulting empty time, the show&#x27;s writers elected to have Nye demonstrate the household uses of liquid nitrogen. During the demonstration, Nye submerged an onion in liquid nitrogen and proceeded to shatter it, receiving acclaim from the studio audience.

As Nye produced more demonstrations for &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, he began to develop the idea of a show featuring his &quot;Science Guy&quot; persona; KING-TV declined his proposal, though he eventually received assistance from station alumni James McKenna and Erren Gottlieb. Together, the group pitched the show as &quot;Watch Mr. Wizard&quot; meets &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, though the latter part was later replaced with MTV after the arrest of actor Paul Reubens for indecent exposure in 1991. Their pitch lasted for four years, being declined by Fox and other networks over various concerns, until they convinced Elizabeth Brock of local PBS member station KCTS-TV to take a chance on the idea. KCTS-TV commissioned a pilot for &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, which aired on April 14, 1993, on the station itself before airing on PBS stations nationwide for the rest of the month. Nye successfully obtained underwriting from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy. Nye&#x27;s program became part of a package of syndicated series that local stations could schedule to fulfill Children&#x27;s Television Act requirements; because of this, &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; became the first program to run concurrently on both public and commercial stations.

===Theme song===
The &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; theme song was written by songwriter and former math teacher Mike Greene, who also sang the &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; refrain and the distorted voice saying &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;. The word &quot;Bill&quot; is repeated throughout as a percussive shout. 
In developing the theme, Greene first came up with the melody, which he stated was inspired by Danny Elfman and his work with Oingo Boingo. When Greene was enlisted to write the theme song, the show&#x27;s producers requested that the song &quot;not sound like a kid&#x27;s show&quot;; the final result was accordingly uncommon for the time. Greene initially sent the theme&#x27;s producers a demo with Greene singing the theme. Greene then sent two alternate versions with professional singers. The producers ultimately chose to keep Greene&#x27;s voice as they found it funnier.

Set to a house beat, Greene enlisted rappers to repeat the word &quot;Bill!&quot; as a percussive shout, deliberately imitating the shouting featured in House of Pain&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Jump Around&quot;. &quot;I can&#x27;t name them, because it was against their contract to do outside things without permission from their record company,&quot; Greene noted. &quot;It was kinda funny, because they were in my studio one day to record a song. I was working on the Nye theme as they walked in and I told them, &#x27;Hey, do me a favor and go in the booth and chant &#x27;Bill, Bill, Bill&#x27; over and over again.&#x27; They had no idea what it was for, but they&#x27;re cool, so they did. It sounded great, so that&#x27;s the version we kept. The show didn&#x27;t air until a year later, so it wasn&#x27;t until then that they understood what this was really for.&quot; In a comment that Greene posted on Reddit in 2018, Greene mentioned that he believed that the rappers were from several groups in his studio on the day of recording, but the only rapper he could specifically recall was Bronz of A.L.T. &amp; The Lost Civilization. The spoken female vocals were provided by Leslie Kyle-Wilson.

===Production===
The show was created in 1992 by Bill Nye, James McKenna and Erren Gottlieb, produced by McKenna/Gottlieb Producers, Inc, in partnership with KCTS in Seattle. The following year, the production companies entered a distribution agreement with Buena Vista Television, a subsidiary of Disney. As part of the agreement, the profits of the show were split between Disney and the production team, with Disney owning full distribution rights across linear television, home video, and digital streaming. McKenna and Gottlieb all met while McKenna was a producer on &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, a Seattle-based comedy show.

The announcer for the program was Pat Cashman, whom Nye knew from his time on &quot;Almost Live!&quot;. Before his show launched, Nye had previously worked alongside Christopher Lloyd in &quot;Back to the Future: The Animated Series&quot;, where he played Doc Brown&#x27;s assistant and demonstrated several experiments.

The show has been likened to the next-generation version of &quot;Watch Mr. Wizard&quot;. The show ran about the same time as and covered similar topics to &quot;Beakman&#x27;s World&quot;, in fact sharing one crew member, editor/writer/director Michael Gross.

The show was primarily funded by the National Science Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the annual financial support from the viewers/stations of the PBS network. Other funding sponsors included Ore Ida, The Boeing Company (which Nye worked for until 1986, Boeing was also based in Seattle until 2001 when it relocated its corporate headquarters to Chicago, Illinois and later Washington, D.C.), and Intel. The syndicated airings were credited as being &quot;Produced in Association with the National Science Foundation&quot;, while the PBS airings changed it to being &quot;Produced in Association with Walt Disney Television&quot;.

The show began with a 26-episode order for the 1993–1994 television season. After its initial success, it was renewed for a second 26-episode order for the 1994–1995 season, followed by 13 additional episodes for the 1995–1996 season. In February 1996, it was renewed for two more years, bringing the final episode total to 100. The final episode aired in 1999, well after production ended in 1997.

Despite Disney&#x27;s association and ownership with the show, it has never aired on any network owned by Walt Disney Television in the United States (such as Disney Channel and ABC, the latter of which Disney would acquire in 1996, three years after the show premiered.)

===Noggin shorts===

In September 1999, Bill Nye signed a multi-year deal to develop and star in original programs for Noggin, a cable channel co-owned by MTV Networks and the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop). In addition to producing the new content, Noggin acquired all 100 episodes of &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;; this made it the first-ever program acquisition by the channel. Noggin and Nye chose not to develop new episodes of the show, and instead created original shorts featuring Nye, in character and costume from &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;. In the shorts, Nye&#x27;s &quot;Science Guy&quot; persona worked as the &quot;head sparkologist&quot; of Noggin, and he tried to find out what topics sparked viewers&#x27; imaginations. Bill Nye told &quot;Multichannel News&quot; that he was interested in creating multiple original shows for Noggin, including a math-based series and one &quot;showing kids how to exercise good judgment.&quot;

Bill Nye also hosted &quot;Noggin&#x27;s What Sparks You? Special,&quot; a half-hour special that aired on April 7, 2000.

==Impact==

In conjunction with the production of &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, KCTS-TV conducted several research studies that evaluated how effective the program was as an educational tool. In one study, it was found that viewers of the program made more observations and sophisticated classifications than non-viewers. In surveys of elementary students who watched the program, most children concluded that Nye made &quot;kids like science more&quot;. When surveyed whether Nye was a scientist or actor and comedian, most students asserted he was a scientist, though many said both. Students also described Nye almost equally as both &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;smart&quot;, and believed he was a &quot;source of good information.&quot;

==Awards==

During its run, &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; was nominated for 23 Emmy Awards, winning nineteen.

==Home media==
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has released every episode individually on DVD, but never released a full series set. Instead, each episode was released separately on its own DVD, for a total of 100 DVDs costing a combined $1,500. In the United Kingdom, it was distributed on VHS by ViewTech, Bristol. In 1994 and 1995, Walt Disney Home Video released five volumes of &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot;, such as &quot;The Human Body: The Inside Scoop&quot;, &quot;Powerful Forces: All Pumped Up&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs: Those Big Boneheads&quot;, &quot;Reptiles &amp; Insects: Leapin&#x27; Lizards&quot;, and &quot;Outer Space: Way Out There&quot;. All five volumes were released on VHS, containing two episodes. As of May 2017, the 1996 episode &quot;Probability&quot; is edited from its original airing, with a segment removed featuring a cast member saying there are only two genders. Netflix denied allegations they edited it (their new series &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot; features Nye stating gender is on a spectrum) saying &quot;It was delivered to us that way by Buena Vista TV.&quot;

A set of 31 episodes is also available for purchase on the iTunes Store, though they have been split into two separate volumes; one containing 14 episodes and the other containing 17 episodes.

Despite Disney&#x27;s involvement in the series, the series has not been available on Disney+ due to a dispute with Nye over revenue sharing.

==Video game==
A computer game based on the series, titled &quot;Bill Nye: The Science Guy - Stop the Rock!&quot;, was released in 1996 for Windows and Macintosh by Pacific Interactive.

<text>The Faroe Islands have a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

There are two major ideological cleavages in Faroese politics. In addition to the left-right spectrum, parties are also divided between those that want to maintain the Faroes&#x27; place within the Danish Realm (&#x27;unionists&#x27;) and those that want Faroese independence (&#x27;separatists&#x27;).

The current government is formed by a coalition between the centre-left Social Democratic Party, the left-wing Republic, and the centre-right Progress.

== Political parties with elected representation at a national level ==
There are currently six parties represented in the Løgting. The largest party represents centre-left unionism with nine seats, while the second-largest party represents centre-right unionism with seven seats. The next two – each with six seats – represent centre-right separatism and left-wing separatism. There are also two minor parties in the Løgting, representing centre-right and right-wing separatism. The centrist Self-Government party lacks any representation in the Løgting

<text>Legal &amp; General Group plc, commonly known as Legal &amp; General, is a British multinational financial services and asset management company headquartered in London, England. Its products and services include investment management, lifetime mortgages (a form of equity release), pensions, annuities, and life assurance. As of January 2020, it no longer provides general insurance following the sale of Legal &amp; General Insurance to Allianz. It has operations in the United Kingdom and United States, with investment management businesses in the Gulf, Europe and Asia.

Legal &amp; General is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), the asset management arm of L&amp;G, is the 10th largest investment management firm in the world by AUM. It is also the second largest institutional investment management firm in Europe (after BlackRock).

== History ==

===1836 to 2000===
Legal &amp; General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop. Originally called the &quot;New Law Life Assurance Society&quot;, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to &quot;Legal &amp; General Life Assurance Society&quot; to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.

The society became a wholly owned division of &quot;Legal &amp; General Group plc&quot; in the 1970s. Legal &amp; General Group, formed Legal &amp; General America as a holding company in 1981, and bought Government Employees Life Insurance Company (GELICO) and its NY affiliate. The GELICO name changed to Banner in 1983. William Penn was purchased by Legal &amp; General Group Plc as a wholly owned subsidiary of Banner Life Insurance Company in 1989. It bought the Dutch branch of &quot;Unlike Assurance Group&quot; and also set up business in France during the 1980s.

Following the trend in the United Kingdom at the time of financial institutions entering the estate agency sector, Legal &amp; General purchased Whitegates Estate Agency from Provident Financial Group plc for £19 million in December 1989.

In the 1940s the main office of Legal &amp; General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls&#x27; school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls&#x27; school (St. Monica&#x27;s), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams. The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s. In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close &quot;potentially before 2025&quot;. In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood, it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.

The previous Legal &amp; General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company&#x27;s social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal &amp; General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first &#x27;&#x27; company in the UK.

===2000 to present===
The company sold the &quot;Legal &amp; General Bank&quot; and &quot;Legal &amp; General Mortgage Services&quot; to Northern Rock in 2003 and sold its stake in &quot;Gresham Insurance&quot;, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.

In 2008 Legal &amp; General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products, sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to &quot;TCS&quot; (Tata Consultancy Services). The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009 and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010. In 2013 the company bought Lucida Life, a pensions buyout company, for £151 million.

In 2014, there was a &quot;shock&quot; announcement that Legal &amp; General was leaving as one of the Association of British Insurers (ABI)&#x27;s around 300 corporate members, due to ABI&#x27;s &quot;decision to transfer its investment business to the Investment Management Association.&quot; In the same year, the group disposed of its estate agency business, Xperience, which comprised 89 offices and 75 franchisees, trading as CJ Hole, Ellis and Co, Parkers and Whitegates, to Martin &amp; Co for £6 million.

Legal &amp; General took a 46.5% stake in housebuilder Cala Homes in March 2013, taking full control of the company five years later. In parallel, in 2015, Legal &amp; General launched a modular homes operation, L&amp;G Modular Homes, opening a factory in Sherburn-in-Elmet, near Selby in Yorkshire. Production was halted in May 2023, with L&amp;G blaming planning delays and the COVID-19 pandemic for its failure to grow its sales pipeline; 450 factory workers faced being made redundant. By the time it had closed, the enterprise incurred total losses over seven years of £295m - a figure revised upwards to £359m in September 2024. In March 2024, Legal &amp; General began to exit the housing market, appointing Rothschild &amp; Co to handle the sale of Cala Homes, valued at around £750m. In 2022, Cala had sold 3,000 homes and employed 1,300 staff. In May 2024, Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Avant Homes were considering bids, but in September 2024, Cala Homes was sold to its previous owner Patron Capital and investment firm Sixth Street Partners for £1.35bn.

In 2014, the company formed Legal &amp; General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal &amp; General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with ASR in December 2015. In May 2016 Legal &amp; General Assurance in the UK bought the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon.

In 2019 following earlier speculation, the company agreed the sale of its General Insurance division, Legal &amp; General Insurance, to Allianz Insurance, the latter making a simultaneous purchase of the remaining 51% share of Liverpool Victoria General Insurance (LV=) of which it already owned 49%. The acquisition took effect on 1 January 2020, at which time Legal &amp; General Insurance&#x27;s holding company was renamed Fairmead Insurance. The existing policies will be merged into Allianz Insurance&#x27;s subsidiary LV= under one expanded business. Legal &amp; General&#x27;s Birmingham office became an LV= site.

Also in 2019, the company acquired a 13% investment in the electric vehicle charging point operator, Pod Point.

In 2023, the company assumed full liability for the entire pension scheme of Boots through a buy-in arrangement.

<text>The Toronto Hockey Club, known as the Torontos and the Toronto Blueshirts, were a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto. They were a member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club was founded in 1911 and began operations in 1912. The club won its sole Stanley Cup championship in 1914.

The club became the centre of a controversy among NHA owners leading to the NHA suspending operations and the owners forming the National Hockey League (NHL). The Blueshirts were replaced in the NHL by a new Toronto Hockey Club under the ownership of the Toronto Arena Company, the Blueshirts&#x27; former landlord. The Torontos&#x27; players were leased to the Arena ownership temporarily and competed in the NHL in 1917–18, winning the Stanley Cup. The Arena Company was then granted a permanent franchise for the 1918–19 season that evolved into today&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs.

==History==

===Founding to Cup winners===

The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams based in Toronto. National Hockey Association (NHA) founder Ambrose O&#x27;Brien operated four franchises in the NHA: the Cobalt Silver Kings, Haileybury Comets, Les Canadiens and the Renfrew Creamery Kings. In 1910, O&#x27;Brien suspended the Cobalt, Haileybury and Canadiens clubs and sold one franchise to form the Montreal Canadiens, who took the Les Canadiens&#x27; players. In 1911, O&#x27;Brien decided to leave professional ice hockey entirely. Quebec interests bought one of the franchises from O&#x27;Brien, and the final two were sold to interests who planned to relocate the teams to Toronto. Toronto had not previously had an arena with artificial ice that would be large enough for an NHA team, but in 1911 work had begun on constructing the Arena Gardens. The arena was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized on September 19, 1911, with Sir Henry Pellatt as president, Lol Solman as managing director, and directors Aemilius Jarvis, Joseph Kilgour, T.W. Horn, R.A. Smith, and Col. Carlson. There were two other directors from Montreal. W. J. Bellingham was the initial manager.

The franchise which became the Toronto Hockey Club was bought by Frank Robinson, Percy Quinn and other investors for . Quinn was president of the Dominion Lacrosse Association, a Canadian professional lacrosse league that had patterned itself after the NHA. The second Toronto franchise was awarded to a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club of Toronto. The Tecumsehs bought a franchise from O&#x27;Brien, paying cash and promissory notes for Although the NHA franchise was bought from O&#x27;Brien, who had operated a team with it, no other assets came with the franchise. According to &quot;Coleman&quot;, the franchise for the Torontos was that used by the Les Canadiens. Other books quote O&#x27;Brien as selling the Canadiens to George Kennedy, leaving the case of which franchise was sold to Robinson unresolved. In any case, the Toronto team was built from scratch and did not include any players from Les Canadiens. The first manager was Toronto native and former Ottawa Senators player Bruce Ridpath, who had intended to be a playing-coach but was no longer able to play due to an injury suffered when he was struck by an automobile the previous year.

The schedule for the 1911–12 season was drawn up with two Toronto teams. As the Arena was not finished, no games were scheduled to be played in Toronto until the end of January, when the new arena was supposed to be ready. It soon became clear that construction of Arena Gardens would not be finished in time, and in mid-December it was announced that the two Toronto teams had been dropped from the schedule and the league would play with only four teams that season.
The Torontos played their first game on December 25, 1912, before 4,000 fans at Arena Gardens. The Toronto Hockey Club was owned by Quinn, managed by Ridpath, and initially coached by Tom Humphrey who was soon replaced by player-coach Jack Marshall. The team Ridpath put on the ice included Cully Wilson and future hall-of-famers Hap Holmes, Harry Cameron, Frank Foyston, and Frank Nighbor. The Torontos finished the year in a tie for third place.

Before the 1913–14 season, the club faced some upheaval. Ridpath resigned as manager in October 1913 and was replaced by Marshall. Ridpath would try out as a player but gave up his comeback attempt before the season started. Despite the changes, the Torontos won the Stanley Cup in 1914, defeating the Montreal Canadiens in a playoff to decide the NHA champion.

After the season, the team then played a series with the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey League. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted. Nevertheless, the Torontos defeated Victoria in a best-of-five series played in Toronto in three straight games.

===The Livingstone era===

Quinn left the team after the Stanley Cup win to return to business and his absence was felt. The next season, the team fell to fourth place in the six-team NHA with a record of 8 wins and 12 losses (down from 13 wins and 7 losses).

Before the 1915–16 season, several events occurred that changed the NHA and the Blueshirts specifically. Robinson joined the Canadian military in 1915 and put the Blueshirts up for sale. Robinson received two offers for the club; the McNamara brothers and Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Shamrocks. Livingstone was from Toronto and offered more, and Robinson accepted his bid. At the same time, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association—upset over the NHA&#x27;s efforts to bring Cyclone Taylor back east—broke all ties with the NHA and conducted a player raid. The PCHA created a new team in Seattle and stocked it with the Torontos&#x27; two leading scorers in Wilson and Foyston, their goaltender, Hap Holmes, and two other key members of the Toronto team in Jack Walker and Eddie Carpenter. The only regular Blueshirts&#x27; players to remain in Toronto were Cameron and Roy McGiffin. Livingstone announced he planned to sell the Shamrocks. After the dust settled, the Patricks had stocked their new team, conducted a raid on the NHA, Robinson was able to sell his team and Livingstone had the Toronto market to himself. Despite the raid, Livingstone did not retaliate against the PCHA and never did. According to authors Morey Holzman and Joseph Nieforth, this strongly suggested a deal had been made between Livingstone, Robinson and the Patricks. To make up for the players lost in the raid, Livingstone transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and allowed the Shamrock franchise to go dormant. The Torontos, composed mostly of former Shamrock players, skated to a record of 9 wins, 14 losses and 1 tie in the 1915–16 NHA season, finishing in last place in the five-team league.

Livingstone was frequently at odds with his fellow owners, particularly Sam Lichtenhein of the Montreal Wanderers. Tempers boiled over when the NHA added a second Toronto team in 1916–17, representing the 228th Battalion of the Canadian army. The 228th was forced to withdraw its team in mid-season when the unit was called overseas. That left the NHA with an odd number of teams. On February 12, the team owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—decided to even-up the number of teams by suspending operations of the Torontos for the rest of the season. All players were given to other NHA teams for the rest of the season. At the time, the plan was to return the players to the Toronto franchise, but the other owners wanted Livingstone out. At the end of the season, Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that Livingstone sell the club within 60 days. However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale.

===1917–1919: Arena era===
On November 22, the NHA owners announced that the league would suspend operations for the 1917–18 season. About two weeks later, all of the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, the National Hockey League. However, they did not invite Livingstone to join them, effectively leaving him in a one-team league. The NHA owners made this move as a work-around the NHA constitution, which barred them from expelling the Blueshirts even though they had long since lost patience with him.

Despite having rid themselves of Livingstone, the other teams wished to keep a team in Toronto. They also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule due to the Quebec Bulldogs&#x27; decision to sit out the season. Accordingly, Livingstone&#x27;s landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary Toronto franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone&#x27;s Torontos players for the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season. At the time, Frank Calder, the NHL president, was demanding that the Arena Company and Livingstone come to an agreement to transfer the franchise.

To Toronto fans, it looked like little had changed on the ice. Although the team had no official name, it was made up mostly of former Blueshirts. As a result, the newspapers still called the team &quot;the Blueshirts&quot; or &quot;the Torontos,&quot; as they always had. Additionally, the team wore a white sweater with a blue &quot;T,&quot; the same uniform worn by the Blueshirts in the previous season. Led by general manager Charlie Querrie and coach Dick Carroll, the team won the Stanley Cup in 1918. In fitting fashion, no winner was engraved on the Stanley Cup. However, in 1947, the NHL added the name of the Toronto Arenas for 1918.

The Arena Company had originally promised to return the Toronto players to Livingstone if no transfer could be arranged. Instead, before the 1918–19 season, it formed a new club, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club. This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company because it was due money to Livingstone from the players and the Stanley Cup revenues (fixed later by court at $20,000). Additionally, it could exist separately from any legal action filed by Livingstone. On paper, the club was owned by Arena Company secretary-treasurer Hubert Vearncombe and Querrie, with Vearncombe as team president. The NHL readily admitted this new team as a member in good standing. Querrie remained as general manager. However, the team had a dismal five-win season and was forced to suspend operations in February, and blamed Livingstone for interference.

By 1919, the NHA owners had established that there would be no revival of the NHA. However, the dispute with Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy. The Arenas were sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed them the Toronto St. Patricks. This team became the Toronto Maple Leafs midway through the 1926–27 season. The NHA/NHL claimed the $5000 franchise fee from the 1919 St. Patricks was to &#x27;buy&#x27; Livingstone&#x27;s hockey club. By all accounts, however, the money instead went into Calder&#x27;s pocket.

Despite the ties to the Torontos, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts&#x27; history as their own (unlike the Canadiens, the other NHL franchise with NHA roots). They do, however, claim the history of the &quot;temporary&quot; Toronto NHL franchise of 1917–18.

<text>Bourke is a town in the north-west of New South Wales, Australia. The administrative centre and largest town in Bourke Shire, Bourke is approximately north-west of the state capital, Sydney, on the south bank of the Darling River. it is also situated:

* 137 kilometres south of Barringun and the Queensland – New South Wales Border
* 256 kilometres (159 mi) south of Cunnamulla
* 454 kilometres (282 mi) south of Charleville

==History==

The location of the current township of Bourke is on a bend in the Darling River on the traditional country of the Ngemba people. Archaeological sites indicate Aboriginal occupancy of the region dating back thousands of years.

The first British explorer to explore the river was Charles Sturt in 1828 who named it after Sir Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales. Having struck the region during an intense drought and a low river, Sturt dismissed the area as largely uninhabitable and short of any features necessary for establishing reliable industry on the land.
Further exploration of the area did not occur until 1835 when the colonial surveyor Sir Thomas Mitchell conducted an expedition. Following tensions with the local people Mitchell built a small stockade to protect his men and named it Fort Bourke after then Governor Sir Richard Bourke. British pastoral settlement failed to occur for many years in the vicinity due to the large distances from the colonised areas and the strong resistance from the local Aboriginal population.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1859 when British colonists were able to gain a foothold along the Upper Darling, with the arrival of paddle steamers making river transportation and trade to the southern settlements seasonally viable. The first paddle steamer to reach Fort Bourke was the &quot;Genesis&quot; in February 1859, skippered by Captain William Randell.

The first British pastoralist to appropriate land around Fort Bourke was Edward J Spence in late 1858, but it was Vincent James Dowling with his head stockman, John E Kelly, who successfully established the Fort Bourke cattle station and homestead in 1859. Dowling clashed with the resident Aboriginal population, receiving a spear through his hat and his horse being wounded by a boomerang. However, he was able to come to terms with the Indigenous people, who became a cheap source of labour for his run.

The immediate area around Fort Bourke where Mitchell had originally built his little stockade was deemed too flood prone for a township, so an elevated site on the east bank of the river around 10km north of the fort was chosen for closer settlement. This site was called by the Indigenous people Whertiemurtie and by the colonists 18 Mile Point. In 1862 the township of Bourke was officially surveyed and laid out at this locality.

As the pastoralist industry expanded around Bourke, the town rapidly grew into a busy river port, with paddle steamers shipping large quantities of stock and wool south to Echuca, from where the railway extension allowed further transportation to Melbourne.

Road infrastructure improved with the opening on 4 May 1883 of the North Bourke Bridge, designed by J.H. Daniels and modified in 1895 and 1903 by E.M. de Burgh. Its construction was begun by David Baillie and completed by McCulloch and Company. The 1895 modifications led to improved designs for subsequent lift-span bridges. The bridge is the oldest moveable-span bridge in Australia and is the sole survivor of its type in New South Wales. It served for 114 years before being bypassed in 1997 when a new bridge carrying the Mitchell Highway was opened just downstream.

By 1885 Bourke was made accessible by rail and reliance on the river trade to the south was quickly replaced by the more direct rail access to Sydney. Like many outback Australian townships, Bourke also utilised camels for overland transport, and the area supported a large Afghan community that had been imported to drive the teams of camels. A small Afghan mosque that dates back to the 1900s can be found within Bourke cemetery.

As trade moved away from river transport routes, Bourke&#x27;s hold on the inland trade industry began to relax. Whilst no longer considered a trade centre, Bourke serves instead as a key service centre for the state&#x27;s north western regions. In this semi-arid outback landscape, sheep farming along with some small irrigated cotton crops comprise the primary industry in the area today.

Bourke&#x27;s traditional landholders endured a similar fate to Indigenous people across Australia. Dispossessed of their traditional country and in occasional conflict with white settlers, they battled a loss of land and culture and were hit hard by European disease. While the population of the local Ngemba and Barkindji people around the town of Bourke had dwindled by the late 19th century, many continued to live a traditional lifestyle in the region. Others found employment on local stations working with stock and found their skill as trackers in high demand.

A large influx of displaced Aboriginal peoples from other areas in the 1940s saw Bourke&#x27;s indigenous community grow and led to the establishment of a reserve in 1946 by the Aborigines Protection Board. The majority of indigenous settlers were Wangkumara people from the Tibooburra region.

In 1962 in Perth, local high jumper Percy Hobson became the first person of Aboriginal descent to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal for Australia. The tall Hobson jumped above his height to win the event with a Games record leap of . Hobson was celebrated on his return to Bourke and greeted by a brass band playing &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;. A park and illustrated water tower now contribute to his memory.

== Heritage listings ==

Bourke has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 3–7 Meek Street: St Ignatius Roman Catholic Church and Convent
* 45 Mitchell Street: Towers Drug Company Building
* 47 Oxley Street: Bourke Post Office
* Richard Street: Bourke Court House
* 5 Richard Street: Ardsilla
* 17 Sturt Street: Old London Bank Building
* The North Bourke Bridge, opened in 1883, is on the Engineering Heritage Register.

==Demographics==

In 2016, there were 1,824 people in Bourke.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 38.0% of the population. 
* 78.1% of people were born in Australia and 80.2% spoke only English at home. 
* The most popular (40.2%) religion was Catholicism.

In Bourke today, there are 21 recognised indigenous language groups, including Ngemba, Barkindji, Wangkumara and Muruwari.

== Climate ==
Under the Köppen–Geiger classification, Bourke has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with very hot summers and relatively cool winters that are often mild by day. On 4 January 1903, Bourke recorded a maximum temperature of 49.7 °C (121.5 °F), making it tied for the highest temperature recorded anywhere in New South Wales with Menindee, which is located further to the south, and one of the highest maxima to have ever been recorded in Australia.

==Education==
Bourke has many schools for preschool children, primary and high school students. The Bourke–Walgett School of Distance Education allows children to be schooled at home, from preschool to year 12.

==Transportation==

Bourke can be reached by the Mitchell Highway from both the north from Charleville and Cunnamulla and from the southeast from Nyngan. Brewarrina and Walgett are located on the Kamilaroi Highway that has its western terminus in Bourke. Moree and Goondiwindi, located on the Newell Highway, connect to Bourke via various roads. Cobar via the Kidman Way, is connected from the south.

The town is also served by Bourke Airport and has NSW TrainLink bus service to other regional centres such as Dubbo. It was formerly the largest inland port in the world for exporting wool on the Darling River. The Bourke court house is unique in inland Australia in that it was originally a maritime court and to this day maintains that distinction. That distinction is evident in the crowns that sits above the finials of the flag poles atop the corner parapets of the building.

Prior to its closure, Bourke railway station was the terminus of the Main Western railway line. The railway extension from Byrock opened on 3 September 1885. Passenger services on the line were cancelled in September 1975 with the line closing down entirely in 1986, leaving the station derelict.

==Cultural significance==

Bourke is considered to represent the edge of the settled agricultural districts and the gateway to the outback that lies north and west of Bourke. This is reflected in a traditional east coast Australian expression &quot;back o&#x27; Bourke&quot;, from the poem by Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie.

The Tourist Information Centre is located on the Mitchell Highway at The Back &#x27;O Bourke Exhibition Centre.

In 1892 a young writer Henry Lawson was sent to Bourke by the &quot;Bulletin&quot; editor J. F. Archibald to get a taste of outback life and to try to curb his heavy drinking. In Lawson&#x27;s own words &quot;I got £5 and a railway ticket from the &quot;Bulletin&quot; and went to Bourke. Painted, picked up in a shearing shed and swagged it for six months&quot;. The experience was to have a profound effect on the 25-year-old and his encounter with the harsh realities of bush life inspired much of his subsequent work. Lawson would later write &quot;if you know Bourke you know Australia&quot;. In 1992 eight poems, written under a pseudonym and published in the &quot;Western Herald&quot;, were discovered in the Bourke library archives and confirmed to be Lawson&#x27;s work.

Bush poets Harry &#x27;Breaker&#x27; Morant (1864–1902) and Will H. Ogilvie (1869–1963) also spent time in the Bourke region and based much of their work on the experience.

Eye surgeon Fred Hollows was buried in Bourke after his death in 1993. Fred Hollows had worked at Enngonia and around the Bourke area in the early 1970s and had asked to be buried there.

The Telegraph Hotel, established in 1888 beside the Darling River, has been restored and now operates as the Riverside Motel.

==Crime==
In 2008, persistently high levels of criminal offending in Bourke led to a ban of the takeaway sales of beer in glass bottles, fortified wine larger than 750 mL and cask wine larger than two litres with only 3.5% or less alcohol non-glass bottles being sold midday. In 2013, a US-style justice reinvestment program called Maranguka was put in place to combat offending.

By 2017, there had been a 38% reduction in significant juvenile charges in Bourke. However, by 2022 crime in Bourke had again increased which the founder of Maranguka attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2022, ABC Radio&#x27;s national current affairs program &quot;The World Today&quot; detailed numerous allegations of local health workers being routinely abused, threatened and attacked by patients at Bourke Hospital. Such incidents led the University of Sydney to suspend student nurse placements in Bourke.

A lead organiser with the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives&#x27; Association said the violence against health workers in Bourke was emblematic of the issues facing such staff in remote areas. She claimed administration staff from the front office were being called on to check on patients in the aged care wing because there was an insufficient number of nurses. She believed the patients at the hospital were being neglected due to a lack of staff with just two registered nurses responsible for the emergency department, an acute ward, an aged care wing and a COVID ward during a night shift. She feared a nurse could lose their life through the violence, or that a patient could die through the chronic staffing shortages.

Bourke Shire mayor Barry Hollman expressed concern for the ramifications for the hospital if the ongoing violence prompted health workers to refuse to come to Bourke. He said he was devastated by the level of violence in the town, which had shocked the community.

In a statement, Western New South Wales Local Health District chief executive Mark Spittal said his organisation had a zero tolerance of threatening or criminal behaviour and was working with Bourke Shire Council, various agencies and community leaders to address the issues. Spittal said a number of measures had already been established including a 24/7 security presence and improvements to infrastructure such as lighting with further measures expected to be put in place in the near future.

==Media==
The town is served by four FM and two AM radio stations, and five television channels.

ABC radio broadcasts on both the FM and AM bands and is pivotal to maintaining rural and community ties in the area.

There are three community radio stations based in Bourke. 2WEB broadcasts with 10,000 watts on 585 AM. 2CUZ is the Indigenous radio station on 106.5 FM. Gold FM is the tourist info station on 88.0 FM. The first two stations broadcast to a myriad of communities in the region.

The local paper, &quot;The Western Herald&quot;, is published on a weekly basis (every Thursday) year-round, except during a short break at Christmas.

<text>Edward James Livingstone (September 12, 1884 – September 11, 1945) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager. He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts professional ice hockey clubs of the National Hockey Association (NHA), where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League.

==Early years==
Livingstone was born in Toronto, Ontario, to David and Ruth Livingstone, the youngest of three children. He played junior and intermediate ice hockey with the St. George&#x27;s Club in Toronto, before becoming an Ontario Hockey Association referee. He also covered ice hockey for the Toronto Mail and Empire, often reporting on the games he refereed.

Livingstone became manager of ice hockey and football at the Toronto Rugby and Athletic Association (TR &amp; AA). The club, formed after a split from the Toronto Amateur Athletic Club, competed in the Ontario Hockey Association and won the John Ross Robertson Trophy as senior ice hockey champions of Ontario in 1913 and 1914.

==National Hockey Association==
His success in amateur hockey prompted Livingstone to make the jump to the professional game by buying the struggling Toronto Ontarios of the National Hockey Association (NHA). During the 1914–15 season, the Ontarios traded in their orange sweaters for green and were renamed the Toronto Shamrocks. The team skated to a record of 7 wins and 13 losses, an improvement of three games over the 1913–14 campaign.

During the 1914–15 season, on February 3, 1915, Sammy Lichtenhein&#x27;s Montreal Wanderers were awarded a game by forfeit over the Shamrocks. The Shamrocks had told the league that they could not put a full team on the ice without George McNamara and Howard McNamara, who were at the bedside of their ill father. Livingstone asked for a postponement, but Lichtenhein refused and the league ruled the game forfeited. In a gesture of sportsmanship, Lichtenhein then made an offer to reschedule the game and play the Shamrocks on March 6, 1915. Shortly after, with the Wanderers and Ottawa in a tight two-way race for the league championship, Livingstone demanded that Lichtenhein follow through on his offer to play the forfeited game. Lichtenhein was incensed and threatened to have Livingstone thrown out of the NHA. The Wanderers and Ottawa ended the season tied for first place. The NHA executive met on March 4 and decided to recognize the forfeit and not order the Wanderers to play the Shamrocks (the Wanderers were told to pay the Shamrocks $300—the amount they saved by not having to travel to Toronto in February). Instead, a two-game, total-goals series was scheduled between Montreal and Ottawa to determine the champion. The league also rejected Lichtenhein&#x27;s request to have Livingstone expelled from the NHA. Livingstone and Lichtenhein would continue to feud for years. At one meeting during the 1916–17 campaign, Lichtenhein grew so infuriated that he offered Livingstone $3,000 to abandon his team. Livingstone countered with a $5,000 bid for Lichtenhein to shut down his Wanderers.

Before the 1915–16 season, Frank Robinson sold the Toronto Blueshirts — the NHA&#x27;s other Toronto franchise — to Livingstone. The NHA did not want one owner to have two clubs in the league, and Livingstone said that he would sell the Shamrocks; however, Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, who had accused the NHA of reneging on an agreement with their league, raided the Blueshirts and signed away most of the team&#x27;s players. To fill the holes in his lineup, Livingstone transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts, but that left him with little to sell in the Shamrocks. When he had not sold the team by the November 20, 1915, deadline set by the league, the NHA seized the franchise and kept it dormant for the season. Before the season began, Livingstone argued with the owners of Arena Gardens over the terms for the use of their facility and threatened to move his team to Boston. The NHA said that it would not allow the move.

During the 1915–16 season, Livingstone is credited with fielding the first two-line forward team in a game between Toronto and Ottawa.

The 1916–17 campaign was a stormy one for the NHA. Canada intensified its contribution to World War I, and a number of pro and amateur hockey players volunteered for military service. The 228th (Northern Fusiliers) Battalion, CEF of the Canadian infantry formed a team in the NHA, taking the place of the suspended Toronto Shamrocks franchise and sharing Arena Gardens with the Blueshirts. Meanwhile, Livingstone lost several of his Blueshirts to the war effort: Harry Cameron, George McNamara, Howard McNamara, and Percy LeSueur. Keats had also joined the 228th, and Livingstone protested to the league about the loss of his star player. The two clubs eventually reached an agreement where Keats was returned to the Blueshirts in exchange for the right to use LeSueur. Another of Livingstone&#x27;s stars, Cy Denneny, had found full-time employment with the government in Ottawa and told the team that they could either trade him to Ottawa or he would sit out the season. Livingstone said that he would not accept anyone but Frank Nighbor in a trade, or Ottawa could buy Denneny for $1,800—more than double the NHA record for a player sale. He then suspended Denneny in November for refusing to report. Livingstone also offered to take goaltender Clint Benedict for Denneny, but that offer was also rejected by Ottawa. Late in January 1917, it seemed that Livingstone had traded Denneny to the Montreal Wanderers for goaltender Billy Hague—Denneny even signed an agreement with Montreal—but Livingstone backed out of the deal with his nemesis Sammy Lichtenhein. Livingstone ultimately capitulated and sold Denneny to Ottawa, but not before raising the ire of Tommy Gorman in Ottawa and Lichtenhein in Montreal.

===Expulsion from NHA===
On February 8, 1917, the 228th Battalion got its orders to proceed overseas and withdrew its teams from the OHA and the NHA. Three days later, NHA owners—at a meeting that did not include Livingstone—voted to suspend the Blueshirts franchise to keep the number of teams in the league even. Toronto players were put in a lottery and claimed by other teams, although they were to be returned to Toronto when the franchise was reinstated. On February 13, Livingstone issued a statement that he was through with the NHA and that the Blueshirts franchise was available to the highest bidder. Livingstone was going to work on the opening of several arenas and a new hockey league in the United States.

Livingstone filed suit against the league and the other owners, and applied for a court injunction to prevent them from moving the remaining teams out of the league.

In October 1917, Quebec Bulldogs manager Mike Quinn told the &quot;Quebec Telegraph&quot; that the Toronto club had been given three weeks to separate itself from Livingstone with the threat that the other owners would operate without Toronto if the club did not comply. There was no response by the deadline.

At its annual meeting in November 1917, the NHA announced that it was suspending operations because of the difficulties in running a five-team league and the player shortages introduced by conscription in Canada during the off-season. About a week later, all of the owners other than Livingstone announced that they had formed a new league, the National Hockey League. Livingstone was shut out of the new league, but the NHL retained the contracts of the Toronto franchise players.

The Arena Company was awarded a temporary NHL franchise for Toronto and was assigned Livingstone&#x27;s players for the NHL&#x27;s inaugural 1917–18 season on an undetermined &#x27;lease&#x27; basis. The club—which the press and fans called the &quot;Torontos&quot; or &quot;Blueshirts&quot;—would have a successful season, and won the Stanley Cup. The Arena Company did not pay for the players and Livingstone filed suit for the revenue earned with the players, now inflated by the Cup success.

In 1918, Livingstone and Percy Quinn attempted to force the NHA to restart by forcing a shareholder&#x27;s meeting, where he hoped that the minority position of the Brunswick Company in the Montreal Canadiens would disallow their vote and swing the vote his way. The NHA owners shot down the plan at what would be the final meeting of the NHA owners in December 1918, voting instead to permanently suspend the NHA, although the organization could not fold completely while it had ongoing legal actions pending against the Canadian military.

===Legal battles with the Arena===
Having been cast aside by his former business associates, Livingstone spent the next several years in court, in a bid to be compensated for the loss of his franchise and his players. In February 1918, the courts ruled that the NHA and its owners had not acted improperly in suspending operations of Livingstone&#x27;s Toronto Hockey Club. The decision was appealed and upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada on November 19, 1919. Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell most of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win season in 1918–19. The Arenas were forced to suspend operations after their 18th game.

While this legal action was playing out, the Arena Company returned its temporary franchise to the NHL, but refused to return Livingstone&#x27;s players to him for the 1918–19 season. Instead, it formed a new team, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club—popularly known as the Toronto Arenas, with Gardens auditor Hubert Vearncombe as team president. This new team was a self-contained corporation that could exist separately from any legal action, and was thus beyond the reach of Livingstone. The newly minted Arenas were readily admitted to the NHL as a full member in good standing, and continued to use Livingstone&#x27;s players. This resulted in another lawsuit being filed, this one against Arena Gardens, Vearncombe and Arena Hockey Club general manager Charlie Querrie. Arena Gardens argued that Livingstone did not own the NHL rights to the players and could not have suffered any damages. The court ruled in Livingstone&#x27;s favour in January 1920 and awarded $20,000 in damages back-dated to April 1918, but the issue was not settled. Before the end of the year, under the weight of the judgment against it, Arena Gardens went into receivership. Meanwhile, the Arena Hockey Club was sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed it the Toronto St. Patricks.

In October 1923, a ruling was made that Arena Gardens had abused its position as a trustee of the assets of the Toronto Hockey Club—its player contracts—and finding damages of $100,000 in favour of Livingstone. That still was not the end, as the damages were later reduced to $10,000 and that decision was also appealed—all the way to the privy council, which dismissed the appeal in July 1926.

==Attempts to launch rival leagues==
When the rights to his players reverted to him in 1918, Livingstone announced plans to launch the Canadian Hockey Association as a rival to the NHL. The league would include the former NHA team from Quebec, now owned by Percy Quinn, the founding president of the Toronto Hockey Club. Livingstone also received support from Tom Wall, the former owner of the Toronto Ontarios.

In the summer of 1920, there was again talk that Livingstone might get the CHA off the ground, particularly after Percy Quinn was made managing director of Arena Gardens on June 17. Livingstone was looking at starting an international hockey league with franchises in the U.S. and Canada, but the CHA was again thwarted when the NHL moved its struggling Quebec franchise to Hamilton, Ontario which Livingstone had targeted as a prime market.

In 1924, Livingstone again announced that he was forming an international league that would have teams in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, Brooklyn, and Buffalo. It was never launched.

In February 1926, Livingstone announced the creation of the International Professional Hockey League, of which he was president. The IPHL was to have teams in Toronto, Buffalo, and Detroit, and two teams in both New York and Chicago. Nothing ever came of the league.

==American Hockey Association==
In 1926, Livingstone acquired an American Hockey Association franchise for Chicago, the Chicago Cardinals. He negotiated a deal to play at the Chicago Coliseum, the same arena that the fledgling Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League used for its home games. In March 1927, Livingstone tried to sell the team to Harry Herendeen, a Chicago miller, but the league did not approve the transfer. Late in the season, the Coliseum refused to give Livingstone&#x27;s team ice time, citing non-payment of rent. Livingstone said the rejected new club owner had agreed to pay the rent.

After the 1926–27 season, the AHA wanted to negotiate a new agreement with the NHL, setting out the rules for how the leagues would work together. NHL president Frank Calder threatened not to sign an agreement while the AHA was working with Livingstone. On August 24, 1927, the AHA terminated Livingstone&#x27;s membership in the league. When Livingstone tried to sell the franchise, he was told that he did not have one to sell and that four of his players (including Marvin Wentworth, who would play 13 seasons in the NHL) were now the property of the Blackhawks. He filed suit against Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Blackhawks, charging him with tampering with his players and in December 1927 filed a $700,000 lawsuit against Calder and three AHA executives claiming that his team was taken away from him through a conspiracy.

==Ontario Hockey Association==
Livingstone returned to Toronto and gave up professional hockey for the amateur game. In 1929–30, he started coaching the Toronto Victorias junior team in the Ontario Hockey Association. Starting in the 1931–32 season, the team was affiliated with the Lions Club and renamed the Toronto Lions. They played at Maple Leaf Gardens. Even there, controversy followed him. In November 1933, the OHA ordered three of his players to play with their high school teams for the 1933–34 season. Livingstone charged that the move was taken deliberately against him. In the 1934–35 season, his players included future hall-of-famer Gordie Drillon. He continued to coach the team through the 1938–39 season.

Livingstone outlived his enemies Sam Lichtenhein, who died in 1936, Frank Calder, who died in 1943, and Fred McLaughlin, who died in 1944. Livingstone died the day before his 61st birthday in 1945.

<doc id="717069" wikidata="Q2067627" url="?curid=717069" title="Richard Bourke">
<text>General Sir Richard Bourke, KCB (4 May 1777 – 12 August 1855) was an Irish soldier, who served in the British Army and was Governor of New South Wales from 1831 to 1837. As a lifelong Whig (Liberal), he encouraged the emancipation of convicts and helped bring forward the ending of penal transportation to Australia. In this, he faced strong opposition from the landlord establishment and its press. He approved a new settlement on the Yarra River, and named it Melbourne, in honour of the incumbent British prime minister, Lord Melbourne.

==Early life==
Bourke was born on 4 May 1777 in Dublin, Ireland, the son of Anne () and John Bourke. His mother was from County Tipperary and his father from Dromsally in County Limerick. He was educated in England at Westminster School before reading law at Christ Church, Oxford. He was a distant relation of philosopher Edmund Burke, whose home he frequently visited.

==Military career==
After securing the patronage of William Windham, a friend of Edmund Burke, he secured an appointment as ensign in the Grenadier Guards in 1798. He served in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799 and was badly wounded in the jaw, which gave him a lifelong speech impediment and contributed to his decision not to seek a political career. Bourke was promoted lieutenant and captain in the same year and major in 1805. The following year he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and made superintendent of the junior department at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

In 1807, Bourke participated in the British invasions of the River Plate as quartermaster general, taking part in the Siege of Montevideo and the Battle of Buenos Aires. He was promoted to major general in 1821. He retired from the army after the Peninsular War to live on his Irish estate, but eventually sought government office to increase his income. 

==Lieutenant-Governor of the Cape Colony==
Bourke was appointed to the Cape Colony in 1825 and was promoted to Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern District of the Cape of Good Hope, acting as governor for both the eastern and western districts until 1828. Under Bourke&#x27;s governorship, much was done to reform the old mercantilist system of government inherited from the Dutch East India Company at the Cape.

Bourke also introduced laws that upheld the property rights of the indigenous Khoekhoe people, although this legislation was aimed to facilitate the exploitation of the Khoekhoe as cheap labourers.

==Governor of New South Wales==

Bourke was an avowed Whig. In November 1830, the Whigs won government in a climate of reform. Major-General Bourke was appointed to succeed Sir Ralph Darling, who was also Irish-born, as Governor of New South Wales in 1831. Bourke proved to be an able, if controversial, governor. In most of his efforts, he faced entrenched opposition from the local conservatives: the &#x27;exclusive&#x27; faction in the New South Wales Legislative Council, and the Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay and the Colonial Treasurer Campbell Riddell. The newspaper &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; always opposed him. (The exclusives were hostile to the participation of ex-convicts (&#x27;emancipists&#x27;) in civil life, hence were opposed to changes which moved the colony from military to civil governance.) Bourke described himself as being &quot;pretty much in the situation that Earl Grey would find himself in if all members of his Cabinet were Ultra Tories and he could neither turn them out nor leave them&quot;.

Bourke had authority from the Colonial Office to extend trial by jury and substitute civil for military juries in criminal cases. He managed this despite fierce opposition from the legislature, and his 1833 bill for the extension of juries was only passed with his casting vote and with conservative amendments.

Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts, Governor Bourke initiated the Magistrates Act, which simplified existing regulations and limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to 50 lashes (previously no such limit existed). The bill was passed by the legislature because Bourke presented evidence that magistrates were exceeding their powers and passing illegal sentences, in part because regulations were complex and confusing. However, furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights, fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts, and this issue was exploited by his opponents.

In 1835, Bourke issued a proclamation through the Colonial Office, implementing the doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot; by proclaiming that Indigenous Australians could not sell or assign land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown. This proclamation, which effectively deprived indigenous Australians of legal recognition as land owners under colonial law, was prompted by an exploitative attempt to acquire land from local people, under a private treaty, Batman&#x27;s Treaty.

In 1837 a statue of Bourke by English sculptor Edward Hodges Baily was erected to Bourke in Sydney.

Bourke continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts, including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to 70, as well as granting rights to emancipists, such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries. It has been argued that the abolition of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 can be attributable to the actions of Bourke.

In the 1836 Church Act, Bourke abolished the status of the Anglican Church as the state church of New South Wales, declaring each religious denomination on equal footing before the law. He also increased spending on education and attempted to set up a system of public nondenominational schools. He was credited as the first governor to publish satisfactory accounts of public receipts and expenditures.

In 1837, the year of his promotion to lieutenant-general, he was made colonel for life of the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot. The same year, he named the town of Melbourne after The 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister. He returned to England in 1838, traversing the Andes to avoid a voyage around Cape Horn.

==Later life and legacy==
Bourke was promoted to general in 1851. He died at his residence, Thornfield House, Ahane, in County Limerick, Ireland, on Sunday 12 August 1855 and is buried in Stradbally Cemetery in Castleconnell.

Bourke Street in Melbourne&#x27;s central business district and the town of Bourke were named after him. The County of Bourke, Victoria, which includes Melbourne, and Bourke County, New South Wales, were also named after him. Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, is generally considered to be named in honour of his wife.

The bronze statue of Bourke outside the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney was the first public statue ever erected in Australia. It was dedicated on 11 April 1842. It records his accomplishments as governor in florid detail. It was funded by public subscription and made by Edward Hodges Baily in London.

==Family==
Bourke married Elizabeth, daughter of John Bourke, Receiver-General of the land tax for Middlesex; they had a son, Richard, and three daughters. One daughter, Anne Maria, married the Australian administrator and politician Sir Edward Deas Thomson, and was an ancestor of the Barons Altrincham. Another daughter, Frances, married Rev. John Jebb, nephew and namesake of a Bishop of Limerick. His daughter Mary Jane married Dudley Montague Perceval, the fifth son of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, an administrator at the Cape of Good Hope during Bourke&#x27;s tenure as Lieutenant Governor.

In 1836 Bourke changed the matron of Parramatta Female Factory from Ann Gordon to another. There were rumours that Bourke&#x27;s son was the father of children born to Ann Gordon&#x27;s daughters.

<text>The Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) was a British financial institution that operated between 1810 and 1995 when it was merged with Lloyds Bank. Trustee savings banks originated to accept savings deposits from those with moderate means. Their shares were not traded on the stock market but, unlike mutually held building societies, depositors had no voting rights; nor did they have the power to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organisation. Directors were appointed as trustees (hence the name) on a voluntary basis. The first trustee savings bank was established by the Rev. Henry Duncan of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire for his poorest parishioners in 1810, with its sole purpose being to serve the local people in the community. Between 1970 and 1985, the various trustee savings banks in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into a single institution named TSB Group plc, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, the TSB merged with Lloyds Bank to form Lloyds TSB, at that point the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest (to HSBC, which had taken over the Midland Bank in 1992) by market capitalisation.

In 2009, following its acquisition of HBOS, Lloyds TSB Group was renamed Lloyds Banking Group, although the TSB initials initially survived in the names of its principal retail subsidiaries, Lloyds TSB Bank and Lloyds TSB Scotland. In July 2012 however, it was announced that the TSB brand would be resurrected by Lloyds Banking Group for the 632 branches it would divest as a separate business. The new TSB Bank began operations in September 2013 and was divested via an initial public offering in 2014, with the remainder of the business reverting to the Lloyds Bank name.

==History==
===Early history of the trustee savings banks===
From the outset, savings banks were retail finance institutions set up under democratic and philanthropic principles. They sought to create thrifty habits amongst small and medium-sized savers such as craftsmen, domestic servants or the growing proletariat, who were outside the well-to-do market that the commercial banks served.

In the first half of the 19th century, bank runs or bank collapses were common, so savings banks had no safe outlet for their own deposits. To create trust among potential depositors, the Savings Bank (England) Act 1817 required funds to be invested in government bonds or deposited at the Bank of England. This requirement was extended to Scottish savings banks by the Savings Bank Act 1835 (5 &amp; 6 Will. 4. c. 57). From then on, regulation of savings banks in the UK was quite detailed, with several periods of &quot;ill-health&quot; and lack of trust in their capacity resulting in government intervention in most aspects of the operation and day-to-day management of savings banks, particularly the nature of their investment portfolios.

An essential feature of a savings bank in the UK was that depositors should have a guarantee of the nominal value of their savings, so that these could be withdrawn at their full value with interest no matter how long the deposit. Funds would be under control of voluntary managers or trustees, hence the roots of the name. This guarantee could not be achieved unless funds were held in securities with a similar guarantee. As a result of the Savings Bank (England) Act 1817, all money received by trustee savings banks, other than that needed to deal with everyday transactions, was held by the Bank of England to the credit of the National Debt Commissioners. The act specified duties of the treasurers, managers and trustees of the savings banks, none of whom was to derive any benefit from their office. This feature was to dominate the management of the TSBs until the 1970s.
Savings banks paying interest on deposits (at a rate ranging from 3% to 5%) proliferated. The number of successful institutions in the UK grew until there were 645 in 1861. Their business remained in collecting low-volume deposits, as early attempts at market diversification had been curtailed by the Savings Bank Act 1891.

===Modern history of the trustee savings banks===
By the inter-war years it had become clear that trustee savings banks could compete in the retail bank market. By 1919 the sum of cash and assets held on deposit for all the TSBs reached £100 million, which rose to £162 million in 1929 and £292 million in 1939.

From the 1970s the Irish trustee savings banks followed a similar path of amalgamation to their UK counterparts, becoming, in 1992, a single entity; this was purchased by Irish Life and Permanent in 2002.

Together, the TSBs were as big as any of the four main London clearing banks. There was little competition between the various trustee savings banks. Each individual trustee savings bank served a separate geographic area, although other organisations competed with them, and this competition grew stronger after 1945.

In 1955, inter-savings-bank clearing was extended to the whole country. Such a system had been in operation in Surrey in the south of England for a short time, and it had been proven successful in helping to settle transactions between different savings banks and in improving the service to clients (particularly when on holiday within the UK). Also in 1955, increased competition for deposits (and most notably the growing popularity of hire purchase) led to calls for the Trustee Savings Banks Association to ask the Exchequer and the National Debt Commissioners to allow withdrawals by cheque (as originally proposed in 1926 by W. A. Barclay of the Perth Savings Bank). In 1965 a review of retail credit markets led to the trustee savings banks being allowed to issue current accounts (with cheque withdrawals but no overdraft facilities), undertake the payment of utility bills, and safeguard securities and valuables. Accordingly, the &quot;TSB Trust Company&quot; was established in 1967 and a year later the first unit trust issue was offered.

Regulatory innovations which allowed the TSBs to diversify their business threatened to erode the deposit base of the clearing banks. But this potential diversification was limited by the restrictive central control of the Exchequer, the National Debt Commissioners and the Trustee Savings Bank Inspection Committee. This type of central control had been designed both to guarantee depositors that the savings banks would remain a secure alternative for their deposits and, by standardising general interest rates and regulations, to make it possible for local trustees to work autonomously.

By the early 1960s transactions at retail counters were increasing at around 5% per annum. In 1964 the London Trustee Savings Bank was the first to computerise standing orders, and all account records were put on computer by 1967 – this being the first UK bank to do so. Some other savings banks still worked with leather-bound ledgers, and others used passbooks; either way handwritten record cards piled up in thousands and even the most basic management information and accounting (such as the annual balance sheet) was a huge task to compile, requiring a lot of overtime. The savings banks&#x27; administration was thus antiquated and time-consuming. They needed modernization and streamlining.

=== Amalgamation into a single entity===
In 1970 there were 75 savings banks in a loose association, with £2,806 million in total assets. There was a wide variation in size: five of the banks each had over £100m in assets (together accounting for 25% of the total), 14 had between £50m and £100m (35%), 39 between £10m and £50m (38%) and 17 under £10m (2%). The largest trustee savings banks were based in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast. Those based in the north of England accounted for 50% of total funds, while those in the south of England and Wales accounted for 27%, those in Scotland for 19% and those in Northern Ireland for less than 5%. Geographical location of the 1,655 trustee savings bank branches was also unevenly distributed, with branch density higher in parts of Scotland and the north of England. In 1978 there was one savings bank branch per 18,000 persons in Scotland, but only one per 75,000 persons in London. There was a similar pattern for individual accounts, with two out of five persons in Scotland having an account at a trustee savings bank, one out of five in the north of England, but only one out of twenty in London and the Home Counties.

In 1973 at the time of the report by the Page Committee, there were still 73 TSBs and 1,549 branch offices. Eight years had passed since the introduction of cheque accounts. The TSBs sensed the need to respond to changing customer needs. However some individual TSBs had grown faster than others. The assets of the Scottish TSBs, traditionally the strongest members of the TSB movement, had been growing more slowly than those in Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands, Wales and the West Country, which had built up enviable reserves and were anxious to protect their territories. London and southern England remained the areas where the savings banks had little presence.

While savings banks and government were considering the movement&#x27;s future organisational structure and functions as well as those of individual TSBs, the TSBs remained restricted in what services they could offer: they could not give loans to their customers, and there were still limits on how funds could be invested. At this critical stage, the Page Committee recommended that the TSBs be freed from government control, allowed to develop their service range, and thus become a third force in banking.

These recommendations were high on the agenda of the newly elected government of Harold Wilson. But the pace of change was to be slow. Officials at the Bank of England, with the support of Sir Athelstan Caröe, then chairman of the Trustee Savings Banks Association, called for the establishment of a strong central authority to assume many of the control powers vested in the government, bearing in mind the need to build up adequate capital reserves virtually from scratch. For the government, there was an advantage in widening the TSBs&#x27; investment powers only slowly, not least the threat of competition to its own newly created bank, National Girobank.

TSBs actively computerised their administration. Two companies were set up in 1972 in preparation for future change: TSB Computer Services Ltd., co-ordinated all computer systems and related developments, and Central Trustee Savings Bank Ltd. dealt with volume transactions.

The Trustee Savings Banks Act 1976 allowed TSBs to offer services equivalent to those of the clearing banks, but it also required that, in the space of one year, the number of independent TSBs was reduced from 73 to 19, under the central co-ordinating authority of the &quot;TSB Central Board&quot;.

The 19 banks were:

* Aberdeen Savings Bank
* Birmingham Municipal TSB
* TSB of the Channel Islands
* TSB of Eastern England
* TSB of Lancashire and Cumbria
* TSB of Leicester and Nottingham
* TSB of Mid-Lancashire and Merseyside
* TSB of the Midlands
* TSB North East
* TSB of Northern Ireland
* North Staffordshire TSB
* TSB North West Central Region
* TSB South East
* TSB of South Scotland
* South West TSB
* TSB of Tayside and Central Scotland
* TSB of Wales and Border Counties
* West of Scotland TSB
* TSB of Yorkshire and Lincoln

This organisational framework for savings banks was in place between 1976 and 1984, a period during which TSB management undertook a series of fundamental changes while pursuing the creation of independent and profitable financial services group.

Tom Bryans, general manager of the Northern Ireland Trustee Savings Bank, was the first chief executive of the newly amalgamated trustee savings banks. He was in his mid-50s, and had spent all his working life at the TSB movement, becoming a manager in 1956 and then becoming an expert in computerised banking. Bryans took the helm with a mandate to turn the savings banks from a quasi-government body into successful independent providers, but his salary of £17,000 per annum was well below those paid at similar posts at clearing banks.

The amalgamation of individual TSBs into purposely created regional banks and the establishment of a central board in 1975 provided the resources to support the introduction of personal lending in 1977. However, attempts to diversify across retail bank markets failed. Together with the National Giro Bank and the Co-operative Bank, the efforts of the TSBs to penetrate retail finance from scratch in 1971 resulted in only £200m in direct consumer loans in 1979, which accounted for less than 3% of total consumer lending that year.

In 1984, the government published a white paper and a new TSB Bill, in which the quasi-federal decentralised structure was abandoned in favour of a single central organisation that no longer had a unique corporate status but was incorporated under the Companies Act 1985. The purported aim was to give the TSB Group plc, as it was called, a more effective operating structure and also to establish clear ground rules on ownership and accountability, neither of which was clear under former legislation. Airdrie Savings Bank refused to join the single entity, and remained the only independent such bank in the UK until it announced its closure in 2017.

In 1984, TSB adopted an advertising slogan by which it is still generally remembered today: &quot;The Bank That Likes To Say Yes&quot;.

In 1986, the Central Trustee Savings Bank Limited was renamed TSB England and Wales plc and Trustee Savings Bank plc was renamed TSB Scotland plc.

===Flotation===
In 1986, the shares of TSB Group plc were floated on the stock market and the proceeds given to the bank, adding to the ownership equity – a process described by one commentator as &quot;selling people a gold box in such a way that when they opened it they found the purchase price inside&quot;. The original holding company, Trustee Savings Banks (Holdings) Limited, continued to be registered at Companies House under that name until 2013.

The newly formed TSB Group&#x27;s retail banking operations were consolidated into TSB England and Wales, TSB Scotland, TSB Northern Ireland and TSB Channel Islands, each trading as TSB Bank. In 1989, TSB England and Wales officially became TSB Bank, with TSB Bank Scotland and TSB Bank Northern Ireland becoming its subsidiary undertakings. The Northern Irish business was sold to Allied Irish Banks in 1991 (trading as First Trust Bank until 2019) and the Channel Islands business was integrated into TSB Bank in 1992.

===Merger with Lloyds Bank===

TSB Group merged with Lloyds Bank in 1995 to form Lloyds TSB. The merger was structured as a reverse takeover by TSB; Lloyds Bank plc was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and TSB Group plc was renamed Lloyds TSB Group plc on 28 December, with former Lloyds Bank shareholders owning a 70% equity interest in the share capital, effected through a scheme of arrangement. The new bank commenced trading in 1999, after the statutory process of integration was completed. On 28 June, TSB Bank plc transferred engagements to Lloyds Bank plc which then changed its name to Lloyds TSB Bank plc; at the same time, TSB Bank Scotland plc absorbed Lloyds&#x27; three Scottish branches becoming Lloyds TSB Scotland plc. The combined business formed the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest to Midland Bank (now HSBC) by market capitalisation.

===Revival of the TSB brand===

Following its acquisition of HBOS in January 2009, Lloyds TSB Group was renamed Lloyds Banking Group. In 2009, following the UK bank rescue package, HM Government took a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group, which later announced that, in order to comply with European Union state aid requirements, it would spin off a part of its business under the TSB brand. The new TSB business consists of all Lloyds TSB Scotland branches, all Cheltenham and Gloucester branches, and some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales.

After a provisional agreement to sell the Lloyds TSB Scotland business to Co-operative Banking Group fell through in early 2013, Lloyds decided to divest it through a stock market flotation. The new TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, at which time the remainder of Lloyds TSB was renamed to Lloyds Bank.

<doc id="717074" wikidata="Q2284915" url="?curid=717074" title="Brent Butt">
<text>Brent Leroy Butt (born August 3, 1966) is a Canadian actor, comedian, and writer. He is best known for his role as Brent Leroy on the CTV sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, which he created. He also created the television series &quot;Hiccups&quot; and wrote the 2013 film &quot;No Clue&quot;. In 2023, he released his debut novel, &quot;Huge&quot;, a psychological thriller about touring comedians.

==Early life and education==
Born on August 3, 1966, in Tisdale, Saskatchewan, Butt attended Tisdale Unit Composite School. After graduating, Butt briefly attended Ontario&#x27;s Sheridan College before returning to his home in Saskatchewan.

==Career==
While working as a drywaller, Butt and a friend started a publishing company, Windwolf Graphics. His comic, &quot;Existing Earth&quot;, was nominated for an Eagle Award. They published two issues before running out of money.

In February 1988, Butt performed stand-up comedy for the first time at an amateur night at a Saskatoon comedy club. He then began performing in the Yuk Yuk&#x27;s chain in Western Canada, before moving to Toronto in 1989, where he lived in a Cabbagetown apartment with two other comedians, and performing at Yuk Yuk&#x27;s there.

Butt presented stand-up performances for CTV, CBC Television, CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Definitely Not the Opera&quot;, and The Comedy Network in Canada, as well as A&amp;E in the United States and the Special Broadcasting Service in Australia. He composed a number of prairie-oriented funny and/or &quot;folksy&quot; songs, including &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Saskatchewan&quot; and &quot;Hairy Legs&quot;.

In 2003, through his production company Prairie Pants, Butt co-created the CTV television series &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, set in his home province of Saskatchewan. He starred in the show from 2004 to 2009

On May 19, 2005, Butt hosted a Royal Command Performance gala for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, held in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to celebrate the Canadian province&#x27;s centennial. He performed his song &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Saskatchewan&quot; and traded jokes with Leslie Nielsen. That year, he also hosted the Juno Awards.

In 2008, Butt and Prairie Pants made the decision to end &quot;Corner Gas&quot; after its sixth season, which aired during the 2008–2009 season.

At the World Television Festival in Banff, Alberta, Butt was given the Comedy Network Sir Peter Ustinov Award which is presented in recognition of a significant body of comedic work. Past recipients include John Cleese, Bob Newhart, John Candy, and Eugene Levy.

Butt also wrote and produced a comedy series for CTV, from 2010 to 2011, entitled &quot;Hiccups&quot;. The series starred Nancy Robertson as Millie Upton, a children&#x27;s author who begins seeing a life coach to deal with her anger management issues.

On July 25, 2010, Butt had a one-hour comedy special titled &quot;The Brent Butt Comedy Special&quot;. It was shown on The Comedy Network. Guest stars were Seth Rogen, Dave Foley, and Jully Black.

In 2014, Butt co-wrote and co-executive produced the film, &quot;Corner Gas: The Movie&quot;, which was released in theatres and on CTV on December that year. He also reprised the role of Brent LeRoy. The film included cameo appearances by several Canadian TV personalities as well as Academy Award nominee Graham Greene and Will Sasso.

In April 2018, Brent&#x27;s follow-up series &quot;Corner Gas Animated&quot; premiered on The Comedy Network.

In 2023 his debut novel was released, &quot;Huge&quot;, a psychological thriller set among stand-up comedians on tour.

==Personal life==
Butt is married to his &quot;Corner Gas&quot; and &quot;Hiccups&quot; co-star Nancy Robertson. The two have been married since 2005.

==Awards and nominations==
Butt has won four Canadian Comedy Awards, for Best Male Stand-up (2001), Best Male TV Performance (&quot;Corner Gas&quot;, 2004–05), and Best Writing – TV Series (&quot;Corner Gas&quot;, 2004). The Comedy Network Sir Peter Ustinov Award was awarded to Butt at the Banff World Television Festival in 2008.

<text>Abau is a Papuan language spoken in southern Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea, primarily along the border with Indonesia.

In 2002, there were estimated to be between 4,500 and 5,000 speakers, and this number does not appear to have declined since the first accurate count in the 1970s.

Abau is reported to have whistled speech.

==Phonology==

Abau has the simplest phonemic inventory in the Sepik language family.

==Pronouns==
Pronouns are:

The dual and plural numbers only distinguish between first person and non-first person. Also, the third-person gender distinction exists only for the singular, but not the dual or plural forms.

==Noun classes==
Abau noun classes are:

Nouns can take on different class affixes depending on the physical characteristics being emphasized. Examples:

;&quot;su&quot; ‘coconut’
*&quot;su pi-ron&quot; /coconut class.5-one/ ‘a coconut palm’
*&quot;su ka-mon&quot; /coconut class.2-one/ ‘a coconut’

;&quot;pey&quot; ‘sugarcane’
*&quot;pey pi-ron&quot; /sugarcane class.5-one/ ‘one stalk of uncut sugarcane’
*&quot;pey houk-mon&quot; /sugarcane class.12-one/ ‘one piece of sugarcane’
*&quot;pey eind-mon&quot; /sugarcane class.9-one/ ‘bundle of stored stalks of sugarcane’
*&quot;pey hnaw-mon&quot; /sugarcane class.11-one/ ‘one bundle of sugarcane ready for transport’

Like most other Sepik languages, Abau overtly marks grammatical gender (see &quot;Sepik languages#Gender&quot;). The same object can be classified as either masculine or feminine, depending on the physical characteristics intended for emphasis. Example:
;&quot;youk&quot; ‘paddle’
*&quot;youk se&quot; ‘paddle .’ (focuses on the &quot;length&quot; of the paddle)
*&quot;youk ke&quot; ‘paddle .’ (focuses on the &quot;flat nature&quot; of the two-dimensional paddle blade)

==Verbal morphology==
Abau had three periodic tense suffixes: diurnal -kok, postmeridial -ropay and nocturnal -nayr

==Vocabulary==
The following basic vocabulary words are from Foley (2005) and Laycock (1968), as cited in the Trans-New Guinea database:

<text>Gabrielle Sunshine Miller (born November 9, 1973) is a Canadian actress who, since the start of her career in 1993, has appeared in many television films and series episodes, including leading roles in two of Canada&#x27;s most popular concurrently-running series, the sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot; (2004–09) and the comedy-drama &quot;Robson Arms&quot; (2005–08). She was also a regular or semi-regular on the TV series &quot;Pasadena&quot; (2002), &quot;Alienated&quot; (2003–04), &quot;Call Me Fitz&quot; (2012–13), &quot;Mother Up!&quot; (2013) and &quot;Good Witch&quot; (2015–16).
