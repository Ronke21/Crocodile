<text>The Grandmaster (En Dwi Gast) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69. The Grandmaster is one of the ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations&#x27; games of skill and chance. Different media appearances depict him as the Collector&#x27;s brother.

Jeff Goldblum portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot; (2017) and in a cameo during the closing credits of &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot; (2017). Additionally, Goldblum voices alternate universe versions in the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021).

==Publication history==

The Grandmaster first appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (Oct. 1969). The character was created by Roy Thomas and Sal Buscema.

==Fictional character biography==
Although his exact origin is unknown, he is one of the oldest living beings in the universe, coming from one of the first intelligent races to evolve after the Big Bang. He once possessed the Mind Gem, one of the six Infinity Gems, but he lost it to Thanos. He is a cosmic game player whose preferred game is pitting two opposing teams against each other. He has used the Squadron Sinister, Daredevil, the Defenders, the East and West Coast Avengers, Malibu Comics&#x27;s Ultraforce, and DC Comics&#x27; Justice League of America.

In his first appearance, the Grandmaster played a game against Kang the Conqueror for the power to resurrect Ravonna or destroy Kang&#x27;s planet, using the Avengers and Squadron Sinister as pawns. However, Kang&#x27;s efforts failed due to the intervention of the Black Knight meaning that the Avengers did not technically win their fight, causing Kang to sacrifice the power to resurrect Ravonna for the power to kill the Avengers, with this attempt failing again when the Grandmaster&#x27;s gift literally gave Kang the power to kill only the &quot;Avengers&quot; rather than the currently-unaffiliated Black Knight. He next used the Defenders as pawns in a game against the Prime Mover.

The Grandmaster later challenged Death to a game of strategy, with the power to resurrect his fellow Elder the Collector as prize. A large collection of Earth heroes were used as pawns by both sides of the game; the Grandmaster promised that, if he won, he would never again use Earth&#x27;s heroes as his pawns. The Grandmaster won, only to learn the resurrection power could only be used if someone else died in the resurrectee&#x27;s place. Nonetheless, the Grandmaster felt the game would be incomplete unless the power was used, noting &quot;Never, in a thousand games on a thousand worlds, have I quit the table ere the game was through!&quot; Death suggested he use the heroes&#x27; lives instead, but, unwilling to break his promise to never again manipulate them, he instead sacrificed his own life to resurrect the Collector.

The Grandmaster returned from beyond his grave to plague the East and West Coast Avengers during one of their annual games of baseball, reasoning that, since he was dead, he was free from his vow to leave Earth&#x27;s heroes in peace. After he and the Collector tricked the teams into battling each other, the Grandmaster succeeded in his true plan: to capture Lady Death and usurp her powers. He forced the Avengers to participate in a competition with the Legion of the Unliving in order to stop a series of powerful bombs, the fate being all of creation. Captain America and Hawkeye were the only two heroes to survive; the rest of the Avengers were slain, only to instantly join the Legion. As the Grandmaster was preparing to force the pair to fight the Legion again, Hawkeye convinced him to lay it all on the line with one last game of pure chance. Hawkeye held one arrow in each fist, the tips hidden in his hands. Grandmaster would win if he chose the one with Hawkeye&#x27;s last arrowhead. The one he picked was headless (Hawkeye admits to Captain America that he had cheated: he quickly snapped off the arrowhead as the Grandmaster chose the correct arrow), and his distraction allowed Lady Death to escape her bonds and banish the Grandmaster from her realm — in other words, making them effectively immortal. As a reward, she returned the deceased Avengers to life. This incident is what led Death to ban the Elders from dying, confirmed by the Grandmaster in the issue&#x27;s final panels, just before he expresses interest in the Avengers&#x27; renewed baseball game.

He and a group of ten other Elders then conspired to kill Galactus and restart the universe; they felt that being banned from Death&#x27;s realm would make them the sole survivors to continue their obsessions in a whole new universe. The Grandmaster battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer, and was one of the five Elders captured and consumed by Galactus. The devoured Elders caused Galactus &quot;cosmic indigestion&quot; from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos. When the Silver Surfer asked the five Elders to aid them in helping Galactus to defeat the In-Betweener the Grandmaster refused because it would nullify a solemn wager the Elders had made so the Champion physically restrained him until the battle was over. Moments later, the five Elders used their Infinity Gems to escape Galactus and his vengeance.

The Grandmaster traveled to the Ultraverse to collect the Infinity Gems that were in Loki&#x27;s possession. Both decide to make a competition for the possession of gems, pitting the Avengers against Ultraforce. However both lost the gems to the entity Nemesis.

In 2004 the Grandmaster organized the meeting of the Avengers and the Justice League in an attempt to save the Marvel Universe from the DC Comics villain Krona, when Krona came to the Marvel Universe seeking answers about the origin of creation. In an attempt to save his universe, Grandmaster challenged Krona to a game for the identity of a being in the Marvel Universe who had lived through the Big Bang by pitting the Avengers and the JLA against each other in a &#x27;scavenger hunt&#x27; for twelve items of power- with Krona choosing the Avengers as his team-, only for Krona to turn on the Grandmaster when he lost due to Captain America helping Batman gain the Cosmic Cube. Although Krona&#x27;s anti-energy powers were able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, the Grandmaster revealed the game was a trick and was able to use the items gathered to merge the two universes and trap Krona in their &#x27;junction point&#x27;. However Krona accelerated the process, with the intention of destroying both universes and learning their secrets. The Phantom Stranger guided the two teams to the Grandmaster, who showed them the truth of reality, then died. However the Grandmaster was resurrected when reality was returned to normal, and it was revealed he had been playing a game with the New God Metron.

The Grandmaster later recreated his Squadron Sinister, with new incarnations of members Doctor Spectrum and Hyperion, to contend against Baron Helmut Zemo&#x27;s Thunderbolts. He has been using this Squadron to destroy several sources of extra-dimensional energy, known collectively as the &quot;Universal Wellspring&quot;, apparently to prevent Zemo from controlling them. The Grandmaster was dispersed by Zemo in a battle for the final Wellspring. In &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #108 he was restored and battled Zemo for control of Earth, however using all the power of Earth that had been loaned to him by Earth&#x27;s superhumans, Zemo was able to take his powers away. Zemo then shot the Grandmaster in the head seemingly killing him.

The Grandmaster returns, promising the Hulk the revival of his long-lost love, Jarella (though this has been thought in the past to be beyond his powers), if he participates in a battle to the death with a team of his choice. The Hulk chooses Doctor Strange, Namor, and the Silver Surfer. However, the Grandmaster takes them from different points in time (specifically, moments when their greatest loves were lost to them), and sets them against a team gathered by the Collector called the Offenders (which is composed of Red Hulk, Baron Mordo, Tiger Shark, and Terrax). This again causes conflict with Galactus. Upon the conclusion of this battle the Grandmaster is apparently slain by the Red Hulk, and the Collector quits, simply leaving Hulk with Jarella&#x27;s corpse.

The Grandmaster returns, with a more childish attitude. He has developed romantic feelings towards the X-Man heroine Dazzler. To that end, he stages a roller derby pitting her and two friends against dozens of super-villains. This angers Dazzler, because romance does not involve putting the person you care about in seemingly deadly danger.

Eight months after the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline as part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel,&quot; the Grandmaster competes against Collector on Battlerealm (a location which is made up of the remnants of Battleworld) in a new Contest of Champions with the prize being an artifact called the Iso-Sphere.

During the &quot;No Surrender&quot; arc, Grandmaster forms his version of the Lethal Legion to go up against Challenger&#x27;s Black Order in a contest that involves Pyramoids. It is later revealed that Voyager is Grandmaster&#x27;s daughter who he used in his plans to claim the Pyramoids. His plan was finally defeated when Living Lightning confronted the Grandmaster and provoked him into a game of poker, with Santos subsequently raising the stakes of the game until he reached a point where the stakes were that the loser would have all memory of their accomplishments wiped from the memories of all who knew of them. Faced with this potential loss, the Grandmaster folded despite his ignorance of Santos&#x27;s hand, as he could not bear to lose everything like that, whereas Santos accepted that being an Avenger meant doing the right thing because it was the right thing to do rather than because you would be remembered for it.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Grandmaster is revealed to have a sister called the Profiteer, another Elder of the Universe.

==Powers and abilities==
The Grandmaster has been described as manipulating the so-called &quot;power primordial&quot;, radiation left over from the Big Bang, and is one of the most powerful Elders of the Universe. However, his power is considerably below that of Galactus and the In-Betweener. It has been implied that the Grandmaster can, and in some cases has, used highly advanced technology to augment his abilities and perform feats that might be normally beyond him. While the extent of this is unknown, it is known that the Grandmaster has access and mastery of technology far beyond human comprehension.

The Grandmaster possesses a cosmic life force which renders him virtually immortal, including immunity to aging, disease, poison, and imperviousness to conventional injury through regeneration of any damage. He can survive and travel in space unaided and without food, drink, or air. He can utilize his cosmic life force for a variety of effects, including levitation, the projection of blasts of cosmic energy, teleportation across space and time and alternate dimensions, adjusting his size, control time to interact with beings moving at superhuman speed, or transformation and rearrangement of matter on a planetary scale. Perhaps his most fearsome ability is his power over life and death. The Grandmaster can &quot;will&quot; the death of another being. It is unknown if he can will the death of another virtual immortal being. He can also &quot;resurrect&quot; another being no matter how badly injured or heal a person on the verge of death. He cannot resurrect another virtually immortal being powered by &quot;cosmic life force&quot; like himself or anyone who has died past a certain time point. Lastly, he can temporarily bestow these powers upon another being. Currently, due to his machinations against Death, he and the other Elders cannot die.

He has a highly developed superhuman intellect, with vast knowledge and comprehension of games and game theory far beyond present-day Earth, as well as encyclopedic knowledge of thousands of exotic games played throughout the universe. He can calculate diverse low information probabilities within a tenth of a second and remember countless rules and data. He also possesses certain extra-sensory abilities of mental perception beyond those currently known which enable him to sense things about his surroundings not detectable by normal senses, and maintains a psychic link with the advanced computers of his base world, which enhance his mental abilities.

The Grandmaster has access to various exotic extraterrestrial devices as needed, including starships.

<text>Pierre Henri Puiseux (; 20 July 1855 – 28 September 1928) was a French astronomer.

Born in Paris, son of Victor Puiseux, he was educated at the École Normale Supérieure before starting work as an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in 1885.

He worked on the aberration of light, asteroids, lunar dynamics and, in collaboration with Maurice Loewy, the ill-fated &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project. Puiseux created a photographic atlas of the Moon based on 6000 photographs taken by him and Loewy. In 1892 he was awarded the Valz Prize, and in 1896 was he awarded the Lalande Prize, both from the French Academy of Sciences, which he would later become a member of in 1912.

In 1900, Puiseux received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France (the French astronomical society). He became the Society&#x27;s president from 1911 to 1913.

The crater Puiseux on the Moon is named after him.

He was a believing and practicing Catholic who died with the sacraments of the Church.

<doc id="705876" wikidata="Q5185281" url="?curid=705876" title="Crime in Canada">
<text>Crime in Canada is generally considered low overall. Under the Canadian constitution, the power to establish criminal law &amp; rules of investigation is vested in the federal Parliament. The provinces share responsibility for law enforcement (although provincial policing in many jurisdictions is contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police), and while the power to prosecute criminal offences is assigned to the federal government, responsibility for prosecutions is delegated to the provinces for most types of criminal offences. Laws and sentencing guidelines are uniform throughout the country, but provinces vary in their level of enforcement.

According to Statistics Canada, overall crime in Canada had been steadily declining since the late 1990s as measured by the Crime Severity Index (CSI) and the Violent Crime Severity Index (VCSI), with a more recent uptick since an all-time low in 2014. Both measures of crime saw an 8% to 10% decrease between 2010 and 2018. Violent crime, specifically homicide, has declined in Canada by over 40% since its peak in 1975, placing Canada 95th in the world by homicide rate—far worse than Australia, England, France and Ireland, and relatively close to poorer European countries. It is tied for first in the Americas with Chile (homicide rates are 2.7 times lower than in the United States). 

More current crimes that are increasing include drug-related offences, fraud, sexual assault and theft, with fraud increasing 46% between 2008 and 2018. The Crime Severity Index (CSI) in Canada rose by 2% in 2023, marking the third consecutive year of increase and the continuation of a trend that began in 2015. The overall increase was significantly influenced by a rise in reported fraud, which was still identified as a major factor, extortion and child pornography cases, which soared by 52% in 2023. According to the Institute for Economics &amp; Peace Global Peace Index, Canada is ranked the 11th safest country in the world out of 163 countries.

==Statistics Canada data==
The Crime Severity Index (CSI) in Canada rose by 2% in 2023, marking the third consecutive year of increase and the continuation of a trend that began in 2015. The increase was largely attributed to significant shifts in certain types of crime, particularly in the Non-violent CSI, while the Violent CSI saw minimal change. Data showed that the police-reported crime rate per 100,000 people was 5,843 in 2023, reflecting a 2.5% annual change. Both the Violent Crime Severity Index and the Non-violent Crime Severity Index recorded values of 99.5 and 73.5, respectively.

In 2023, there were 778 victims of homicide, 104 fewer than in 2022. Gang-related homicides continued to account for about one-quarter (22%) of all homicides; 78% of these were committed with a firearm, most often a handgun. The proportion of women who were killed by their spouse or intimate partner was approximately 5 times higher than the proportion of men (31% versus 6%).The number of police-reported hate crimes was 4,777 a 32% increase from 2022. Hate crimes targeting a religion or a sexual orientation accounted for most of the increase.

The overall increase in the CSI was significantly influenced by a rise in reported child pornography cases, which soared by 52% in 2023. The increase was deemed partly due to enhanced awareness and better collaboration among law enforcement agencies. Other contributors to the CSI included increases in fraud and shoplifting rates, with fraud rising by 12% and shoplifting of amounts under $5,000 rising by 18%.

Conversely, some crime types saw a decline, including breaking and entering, which dropped by 5%, continuing a slow decline observed since the 1990s. While the Violent CSI remained virtually unchanged, the police reported lower rates of homicide and sexual offenses against children, with a decrease of 14% in homicide rates compared to the previous year.

Several crime types emphasized in the report include fraud, which was identified as a major factor, and extortion, rising by 35% for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the rise in reported incidents, many cases of fraud remain unreported. Reports indicated that only about 11% of fraud victims decided to notify the authorities.

The statistics also highlighted the changing landscape of theft-related crimes, as motor vehicle theft and robbery rates saw increases. Notably, while motor vehicle theft has risen by 5% from the previous year, the rate remains about 50% lower than it was 25 years ago. Relationships to robbery showed a similar trend, with a 4% rise in incidents but still being lower than historical figures from years ago.


===Crime statistics by province and territory===
Crime statistics vary considerably through different parts of Canada. In general, the eastern provinces have the lowest violent crime rates while the western provinces have higher rates and the territories higher still. Of the provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan have the highest violent crime rates. 

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the 2023 Crime Severity Index was 86.3, experiencing a 5.1% increase. The police-reported crime rate for the province stood at 7,175, also rising by 5.0%. Similar trends were noted across various provinces, with notable increases in other areas including Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, while some areas like Nova Scotia reported a slight decrease in their Crime Severity Index. 

The chart below also shows that Saskatchewan has the highest provincial assault rate, and that Manitoba has the highest provincial sexual assault rate, robbery rate and homicide rate of any Canadian province. In many instances the crime rates in the Yukon, North West Territories and Nunavut are the highest in the country and can be up to ten times the national average.

2020 crime statistics for the provinces and territories are given below, as reported by Statistics Canada.&#x27;

===Violent crime severity index by census metropolitan area===
==Police==

In 2005, there were 61,050 police officers in Canada which equates to one police officer per 528.6 persons, but with significant regional variations. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island have the fewest police per capita with 664.9 and 648.4 persons per police officer, respectively. Conversely, the highest ratio of police to population is found in Canada&#x27;s northern territories; Nunavut has 247.9 persons per police officer, the Northwest Territories has 248.5 persons per officer and the Yukon has 258.2 persons for each police officer.

That is a substantially lower rate than most developed countries with only Japan and Sweden having so few police officers. The United States has one officer per 411.5 persons, and Germany 344.8.

Canada&#x27;s national police force is the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is the main police force in Canada&#x27;s north, and in rural areas except in Quebec, Ontario, and Newfoundland. Those three provinces have their own provincial police forces, although the RCMP still operate throughout rural Newfoundland and also provide specific federal policing services in Ontario and Quebec. Many cities and districts have their own municipal police forces, while others have contracts with the provincial police or RCMP to police their communities.

==Comparisons==

Comparing crime rates between countries is difficult due to the differences in jurisprudence, reporting and crime classifications. National crime statistics are in reality statistics of only selected crime types. Data are collected through various surveying methods that have previously ranged between 15% and 100% coverage of the data. A 2001 Statistics Canada study concluded that comparisons with the U.S. on homicide rates were the most reliable. Comparison of rates for six lesser incident crimes was considered possible but subject to more difficulty of interpretation. For example, types of assaults receive different classifications and laws in Canada and the U.S., making comparisons more difficult than homicides. At the time, the U.S. crime of aggravated assault could be compared to the sum of three Canadian crimes (aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and attempted murder). This comparison had a predicted bias that would inflate the Canadian numbers by only 0.1%. The study also concluded that directly comparing the two countries&#x27; reported total crime rate (i.e. total selected crimes) was &quot;inappropriate&quot; since the totals include the problem data sets as well as the usable sets. For reasons like these, homicides have been favored in international studies looking for predictors of crime rates (predictors like economic inequality).&#x27;

===United States===
Much study has been done of the comparative experience and policies of Canada with its southern neighbour the United States, and this is a topic of intense discussion within Canada.

Historically, the violent crime rate in Canada was far lower than that of the U.S.. For example, in 2000 the United States&#x27; rate for robberies was 65% higher, its rate for aggravated assault was more than double, and its murder rate was triple that of Canada. However, the rate of some property crime types is lower in the U.S. than in Canada. For example, in 2006, the rates of vehicle theft were 22% higher in Canada than in the U.S.

The homicide rate in Canada peaked in 1975 at 3.03 per 100,000 and has dropped since then; it reached lower peaks in 1985 (2.72) and 1991 (2.69). It reached a post-1970 low of 1.73 in 2003. The average murder rate between 1970 and 1976 was 2.52, between 1977 and 1983 it was 2.67, between 1984 and 1990 it was 2.41, between 1991 and 1997 it was 2.23 and between 1998 and 2004 it was 1.82. The attempted homicide rate has fallen at a faster rate than the homicide rate. By comparison, the homicide rate in the U.S. reached 10.1 per 100,000 in 1974, peaked in 1980 at 10.7 and reached a lower peak in 1991 (10.5). The average murder rate between 1970 and 1976 was 9.4, between 1977 and 1983 it was 9.6, between 1984 and 1990 it was 9, between 1991 and 1997 it was 9.2 and between 1998 and 2004 it was 6.3. In 2004, the murder rate in the U.S. dipped below 6 per 100,000, for the first time since 1966, and as of 2010 stood at 4.8 per 100,000 

From 2014 to 2022, Canada&#x27;s violent crime rate rose by 43.8% to 434 with 1 violent crime per 100,000 people. In the U.S, the increase was 5.3% to 380 with 7 per 100,000 people. Property crimes in Canada stood at a rate of 2,491 per 100,000 people in 2022, a 7.0% increase since 2014, while U.S. property crimes fell by 24.1%. Homicides in Canada grew from 1.5 to 2.3 per 100,000, rising by 53.4%, while the U.S. homicide rate is significantly higher at 5.8 per 100,000, increasing by 49.4%.

<doc id="705884" wikidata="Q2581417" url="?curid=705884" title="Willie Adams (politician)">
<text>Willie Adams (born June 22, 1934) is a Canadian Inuk politician who was a member of the Senate of Canada from 1977 to 2009.

== Biography ==

Adams was born in Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq), Nunavik&#x27;s largest northern village (Inuit community). Educated at Northern Quebec mission schools, Adams became an electrician, and eventually owned a number of businesses in different industries around Canada. Adams served for two terms as the chairman of the Rankin Inlet hamlet council, and in 1970 became a member of the Northwest Territories Territorial Council (now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories). In spring 1977, Pierre Trudeau, the then Prime Minister of Canada, decided that an Inuk should be appointed to the Senate and dispatched Warren Allmand, the Minister for Northern Affairs, to interview potential candidates. Adams was not excited about joining the Senate upon being asked by Allmand - in fact, he joked that he did not even know what the Senate was, asking the Minister, &quot;What&#x27;s the Senate?&quot; However, upon being advised of a Senator&#x27;s annual salary of approximately C$60,000, far more than Adams&#x27; electrician&#x27;s pay of $7,500 a year, he seized the opportunity. Adams was appointed as a Senator for the Northwest Territories by Jules Léger, the then Governor General of Canada, on the advice of the Prime Minister on April 5, 1977, and is a member of the Liberal Party.

Adams took an intense interest in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, and upon the creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999 became a Senator for that territory.

In 2009, he left the Senate upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. At that time, he was the longest-serving current member of the Canadian Senate, and had served over 32 years in Parliament without ever having faced an election campaign, as Canadian Senators are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, not elected.

== Business ventures ==
By 1997, Adams had founded several businesses, including Kudlik Electric Ltd., Kudlik Construction Ltd., Rankin Inlet&#x27;s Nanuq Inn and Ottawa&#x27;s Umingmak Expediting Ltd. Adams is also president of Polar Bear Cave Investments, a company that owned the Nanuq Inn until its closure in 2003.

== Personal life ==
Adams married his wife, Mary, in the late 1970s. The pair met when the latter travelled to the Northwest Territories to find work as a home economist. The couple have a son, Isaac. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2023. He currently resides in Kemptville, Ontario.

<text>WWE No Mercy, also known as NXT No Mercy from 2023 to 2024, is a professional wrestling event produced by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The first No Mercy was held on May 16, 1999, in Manchester, England, and was the only No Mercy event produced in the United Kingdom. A second No Mercy was then held in October that year in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Beginning with this second event, No Mercy became the annual October pay-per-view (PPV) until 2008. The event was then discontinued and replaced by Hell in a Cell in 2009. After eight years, No Mercy was reinstated in October 2016. However, No Mercy was again discontinued after the September 2017 event, as WWE reduced the amount of yearly PPVs held after they had ended the production of brand-exclusive PPVs following WrestleMania 34 in 2018. In 2023, WWE again revived the event, this time for its developmental brand, NXT, in September.

The first four events were held when the promotion was still called the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In May 2002, the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and in 2011, the &quot;WWE&quot; name became an orphaned initialism for the promotion. During the first brand extension, No Mercy was held exclusively for the SmackDown brand from 2003 to 2006. When the event was reinstated for the second brand extension in 2016, it was again SmackDown-exclusive and was then Raw-exclusive in 2017. It then became exclusive for NXT in 2023. In addition to traditional PPV, the 2016 and 2017 events were livestreamed on the WWE Network, and then just Peacock and the WWE Network beginning in 2023.

==History==

On May 16, 1999, the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) held a pay-per-view (PPV) in the United Kingdom, specifically Manchester, England, titled No Mercy. The pay-per-view market was relatively new to Britain at the time: before One Night Only in 1997, all pay-per-view events were broadcast for free on Sky Sports. The UK-exclusive pay-per-views were established to serve as promotion for the new delivery method, however, were booked and treated similar to house shows. This first event would be the only No Mercy event produced in the United Kingdom, as the WWF held a second No Mercy later that same year on October 17, but in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. No Mercy continued as the annual October PPV for the promotion (with the May UK PPV renamed Insurrextion, held until 2003) until 2008. The event was then discontinued and replaced by Hell in a Cell in 2009, which became the annual October PPV.

In March 2002, the WWF introduced the brand extension, where the promotion divided its main roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown!, where the wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform—in May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The 2002 event, which was the first to be held under the WWE name, featured wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands, but from 2003 to 2006, the PPV was produced exclusively for wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand. Following WrestleMania 23 in 2007, WWE discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, thus the 2007 and 2008 events featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—ECW was established as a third brand in 2006.

In February 2010, the ECW brand was disbanded. In April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name, with the &quot;WWE&quot; name becoming an orphaned initialism for the promotion, and in August that year, the first brand extension ended. In July 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand extension, again dividing the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands. No Mercy was reinstated that year for October and was again produced exclusively for SmackDown but was also the first No Mercy event to be livestreamed on the WWE Network. The following year, it was moved up to September and produced exclusively for Raw. This 2017 event would be the final No Mercy event held, as following WrestleMania 34 in 2018, WWE again discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, resulting in WWE reducing the amount of yearly PPVs produced.

During a conference call held by Shawn Michaels, the Senior Vice President of Talent Development Creative, on July 27, 2023, WWE announced the return of No Mercy for wrestlers of the company&#x27;s developmental brand, NXT. It was the first to be livestreamed on Peacock in the United States, where the WWE Network service merged in 2021. Unlike previous No Mercy events, it did not air on PPV as NXT&#x27;s events ceased airing on traditional PPV beginning in 2022. Starting from October 2024, all NXT major events ceased using the NXT logo, thus reverting the name to WWE No Mercy.

==Theme song==
Jim Johnston, who was a long-time music composer for the promotion, wrote a song titled &quot;No Mercy&quot;, which was used as a regular theme song for the events in 2002, 2004 and 2006, while a remix version in collaboration with Eric &amp; The Hostiles was used in 2007. For the 2016 and 2017 events, the theme song was by KIT and was also titled &quot;No Mercy&quot;. Other theme songs were &quot;Used Up&quot; by composer Max Power, &quot;A.D.D.&quot; by Vanilla Ice featuring Casey Chaos and &quot;Oh Hell Yeah&quot; by H-Blockx in 1999, &quot;RamRod&quot; by composers Daniel Holter and Mike Standal in 2000, &quot;Click Click Boom&quot; by Saliva in 2001, &quot;Today is the Day&quot; by Dope and &quot;Last Man Out&quot; by Victor Reid both in 2003, &quot;Save Me&quot; by Shinedown in 2005 and &quot;All Nightmare Long&quot; by Metallica in 2008.

<text>The Laginiopsidae are a taxonomic family of planktonic, marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the suborder Gymnosomata, commonly called the &#x27;sea angels&#x27;. These small pelagic snails lack shells (except in their early embryonic stage).

Laginiopsidae is represented by a single species (&quot;Laginiopsis trilobata&quot;), itself known from only a single specimen. This was one of several species described by the French malacologist Alice Pruvot-Fol. Like other Gymnosomata, the Laginiopsids are likely carnivorous, though nothing about the species&#x27; feeding habits and life history are recorded.

The body of the single species is rounded with large swimming parapoda (wings). The various tentacles, suckers, jaws, and radula typical of other Gymnosomata are all absent in this family (the lack of a radula being particularly distinctive). The head has a long proboscis tipped with the mouth and three fleshy lobes.

==Genera and species==
Genus and species within the family Laginiopsidae include:
* Genus &quot;Laginiopsis&quot; 
** &quot;Laginiopsis triloba&quot; - distribution: Azores, description: proboscis ends in three fleshy lobes

<text>Ilene Kristen (born Ilene Schatz; July 30, 1952) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Delia Ryan in the ABC soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; (1975–1979, 1982–1983, 1986–1989) and her Emmy-nominated performances as Roxy Balsom on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (2001–2012).

==Early years==

Ilene Kristen was born Ilene Schatz in Brooklyn, New York City, the elder child of Arthur Schatz of Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Myrna Levin of Borough Park, Brooklyn. Her father was a hairdresser who owned a series of beauty parlors across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Palm Beach, Florida. Ilene has a younger sister, Karen Schatz. 

She lived in Brooklyn until the age of 13 when her family moved to the Forest Hills area of Queens, where she lived for two years. In 1968, the family moved to the Upper West Side in Manhattan. She attended PS 217 in Brooklyn, Russell Sage Junior High School in Queens, and Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan. She then went to Finch College where she majored in Drama and minored in Art History.

She studied dance under Sara Felcher, Alwin Nikolais, and Matt Mattox. Her early inspirations were Bambi Linn and Sondra Lee. She decided to become a professional actor after seeing the Off-Broadway musical, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. She later studied acting with Jack Waltzer.

==Career==

Her first television appearance was in 1961 on bandleader Ted Steele&#x27;s &quot;Dance Party&quot;, based in Newark, New Jersey. 

Her first professional job was on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; as a dancer when she was 14 years old. She was brought on board by the show&#x27;s choreographer Matt Mattox. Kristen was a dancer in the ensemble of the 1967 musical &quot;Henry, Sweet Henry&quot;, based upon &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot;. This was the first of several collaborations with the choreographer Michael Bennett, with whom she later worked on the television show &quot;Let Us Entertain You&quot; (starring Robert Morse) and the show &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (with Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits).

In her senior year of professional children’s school, she was on the road with a comedy revue, &quot;The Six New Happenings&quot;. The revue toured in Dallas and Houston. They were booked in the largest room at the Sahara Hotel in Lake Tahoe. But once the Sahara realized that most of the cast was under-aged, had them kicked out, replaced by Johnny Carson.

She was set to replace the lead actress in the show &quot;Steambath&quot;, but the show was closed before Kristen got to take over the role. Its producer Dick Scanga felt bad for Kristen, so he offered her a job in his producing office. She ended up working odd jobs on major Broadway productions: catering the opening-night party of the show &quot;Lenny&quot; (which later became the 1974 film by Bob Fosse) and gold-leafing in Robin Wagner’s scenery department for &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. She made her screen debut in the female lead role in the 1971 comedy film &quot;Preacherman&quot;.

Her big break came when she auditioned for the role of Patty Simcox in the original Broadway production of &quot;Grease&quot; (1972), in which she starred for two years.

In 1975, she auditioned for and landed the role of Delia Ryan in the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot;. She worked on the show until 1979, when she moved to California. In Los Angeles, she appeared in film &quot;Why Would I Lie?&quot; starring Treat Williams. She played Winona, a prostitute, in The Lady in Red (her scene was with Christopher Lloyd), then did an episode of &quot;Family&quot;. In 1982, she also played Peter Falk&#x27;s sister-in-law in a stage production of &quot;Knives&quot;, which was written and directed by John Cassavetes.

On television in 1982, she did a stint on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Georgina Whitman. She appeared in the comedy revue &quot;Strange Behavior&quot; (1983-84), which led to her being considered for a role on NBC’s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She also starred in Charles Strouse’s and Warren Leight’s &quot;Mayor&quot;, the musical based on Ed Koch’s memoir of the same name. She played Leona Helmsley, the “Queen of Mean,” among other characters.

In 1986, after starring in Moss Hart’s &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot;, Kristen was asked to return to &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot;. Kristen, always adept with comedy, says that her last four years at &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot; were happy ones, as the writers gave her a lot of funny material to work with. During this period (1986-90), Kristen toured around the club circuits, performing with rock bands and jazz musicians at Mikell&#x27;s in the Upper West Side. She did another off-Broadway show, &quot;Cowboy&quot;, a musical tribute to the life of the painter Charlie “Kid” Russell.

During the final three years of &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot;, Kristen worked at a homeless shelter, the Prince George. Through the Children&#x27;s Aid Society, she served as the kids’ introduction to the arts and movies. A group of these children later appeared on several episodes of &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot;.

From 1990-1991, she starred in &quot;Loving&quot;, portraying Norma Gilpin, a dees-dems-doze broad from Brooklyn. She was coupled with the Tony Award-winning actor and director Walter Bobbie, who had originated the role of Roger in the Broadway production of &quot;Grease&quot; alongside Kristen in 1972. After that stint, Kristen did three off-Broadway productions: &quot;All That Glitters, Trust&quot;, and &quot;The Gig&quot; at the Goodspeed. She was also Madeleine Thompson, an alcoholic wannabe socialite, on &quot;Another World&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Kristen served as the co-artistic director and literary manager for Musical Theatre Works, alongside Gordon Greenberg. She came out to California to serve as one of the producers for the film &quot;Angels with Angles&quot;, starring Frank Gorshin and Rodney Dangerfield.

After returning to New York City in 2001, she was approached the day before the September 11 attacks for the role of the gambling, beer-guzzling and always-inappropriate hairdresser Roxy Balsom on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. At that point in time, she had begun to question the importance of acting; she’d always seen performance as a healing art, and felt that the kind of character that she wanted to create should be entertaining, vivacious, and funny—because people needed it. She ended up playing Roxy Balsom for ten years. Kristen was nominated for two consecutive Daytime Emmy Awards in 2004 and 2005 in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category for her role as Roxy in &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

After &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was off the air, she featured on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Delia, her character from &quot;Ryan’s Hope&quot;, between 2013 and 2015. Kristen guest-starred in the number of television shows, including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and &quot;Unforgettable&quot;. In the fall of 2013, she appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; reprising her old role of Delia Ryan from &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; who was revealed to be Ava Jerome&#x27;s natural mother, and made periodic appearances as the storyline dictated.

Kristen is a supporter of the emerging digital series genre and has appeared on the Daytime Emmy-winning series The Bay and Pride: The Series. In 2018, she played Dolly Faye in &quot;Mélange&quot;. The pilot featured Morgan Fairchild and was written and produced by Tom D&#x27;Angora.

==Personal life==

Kristen currently resides in Manhattan with director Gary Donatelli. She has been a member of the Ensemble Studio Theatre since 1984 and she is on their Board of Directors.

==Music==

Throughout the 1990s, she was a regular performer with her band at the Triad Theatre.

In 2015, Kristen released her first album, &quot;I’m Not Done With U Yet!&quot;, produced by Scott Yahney and self-penned with various co-writers. It is available on Amazon and iTunes.

As a songwriter, Ilene has penned album cuts for teenage phenom Kaitlyn Lusk and jazz guitarist Chuck Loeb, as well as produced for the label Tuxedo Records.

==Jean Renoir Cinema==

In 1977, Kristen founded the Jean Renoir Cinema with Ray Blanco, a young Cuban anti-Castro emigré, and Nancy Newell, one of the first women ever admitted to the Projectionists Guild. Through Blanco’s distribution company, Bauer International (later Liberty Films), the Renoir saw through the first U.S. theatrical distributions of Wim Wenders’s early German features (including &quot;Kings of the Road&quot; and &quot;Alice in the Cities&quot;), as well as films by Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Alexander Kluge, Gregory Nava’s &quot;The Confessions of Amans&quot;, and Martha Coolidge’s &quot;Not a Pretty Picture&quot;. The Jean Renoir also presented the first American screenings of films from Luis Buñuel’s Mexican period, including &quot;Illusion Travels by Streetcar&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Deceit&quot;, and &quot;El Bruto&quot;. The Renoir also mounted one of the first significant film festivals devoted to Cuban cinema in the United States.

In the opening weekend, Blanco and Kristen screened films by its namesake director Jean Renoir: &quot;Toni&quot;, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot;. The lobby featured a framed personal letter from Renoir, which gave Kristen and Blanco permission to use his name for the theater.

The Renoir remained open until the end of 1977 due to plumbing and landlord problems.

During this time, Kristen produced a film, &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, starring Karen Allen.

<doc id="705892" wikidata="Q10855346" url="?curid=705892" title="Classical cipher">
<text>In cryptography, a classical cipher is a type of cipher that was used historically but for the most part, has fallen into disuse. In contrast to modern cryptographic algorithms, most classical ciphers can be practically computed and solved by hand. However, they are also usually very simple to break with modern technology. The term includes the simple systems used since Greek and Roman times, the elaborate Renaissance ciphers, World War II cryptography such as the Enigma machine and beyond.

In contrast, modern strong cryptography relies on new algorithms and computers developed since the 1970s.

==Types of classical ciphers==
Classical ciphers are often divided into &quot;transposition ciphers&quot; and &quot;substitution ciphers&quot;, but there are also &quot;concealment ciphers&quot;.

===Substitution ciphers===
In a substitution cipher, letters, or groups of letters, are systematically replaced throughout the message for other letters, groups of letters, or symbols.

A well-known example of a substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher. To encrypt a message with the Caesar cipher, each letter of message is replaced by the letter three positions later in the alphabet. Hence, A is replaced by D, B by E, C by F, etc. Finally, X, Y and Z are replaced by A, B and C respectively. So, for example, &quot;WIKIPEDIA&quot; encrypts as &quot;ZLNLSHGLD&quot;. Caesar rotated the alphabet by three letters, but any number works.

Another method of substitution cipher is based on a keyword. All spaces and repeated letters are removed from a word or phrase, which the encoder then uses as the start of the cipher alphabet. The end of the cipher alphabet is the rest of the alphabet in order without repeating the letters in the keyword. For example, if the keyword is CIPHER, the cipher alphabet would look like this:
The previous examples were all examples of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, where just one cipher alphabet is used. It is also possible to have a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, where multiple cipher alphabets are used. The encoder would make up two or more cipher alphabets using whatever techniques they choose, and then encode their message, alternating what cipher alphabet is used with every letter or word. This makes the message much harder to decode because the codebreaker would have to figure out both cipher alphabets.

Another example of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that is much more difficult to decode is the Vigenère square, an innovative encoding method. With the square, there are 26 different cipher alphabets that are used to encrypt text. Each cipher alphabet is just another rightward Caesar shift of the original alphabet. This is what a Vigenère square looks like:

 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
 C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B
 D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
 E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D
 F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E
 G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F
 H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G

 Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X
 Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y

To use the Vigenère square to encrypt a message, a coder first chooses a keyword to use and then repeats it until it is the same length as the message to be encoded. If is the keyword, each letter of the repeated keyword will tell what cipher (what row) to use for each letter of the message to be coded. The cipher alphabet on the second row uses B for A and C for B etc. That is cipher alphabet &#x27;B&#x27;. Each cipher alphabet is named by the first letter in it. For example, if the keyword is and the message to encode is , then the encoding is:

Some substitution ciphers involve using numbers instead of letters. An example of this is the Great Cipher, where numbers were used to represent syllables. There is also another number substitution cipher that involves having four different number pair options for a letter based
on a keyword.

Instead of numbers, symbols can also be used to replace letters or syllables. One example of this is Zodiac alphabet, where signs of the zodiac were used to represent different letters, for example, the symbols for the sun stood for A, Jupiter stood for B, and Saturn stood for C. Dots, lines, or dashes could also be used, one example of this being Morse Code, which is not a cipher, but uses dots and dashes as letters nonetheless. The pigpen cipher uses a grid system or lines and dots to establish symbols for letters. There are various other methods that involve substituting letters of the alphabet with symbols or dots and dashes.

===Transposition ciphers===
In a transposition cipher, the letters themselves are kept unchanged, but their order within the message is scrambled according to some well-defined scheme. Many transposition ciphers are done according to a geometric design. A simple (and once again easy to crack) encryption would be to write every word backwards. For example, &quot;Hello my name is Alice.&quot; would now be &quot;olleH ym eman si ecilA.&quot; A scytale is a machine that aids in the transposition of methods.

In a columnar cipher, the original message is arranged in a rectangle, from left to right and top to bottom. Next, a key is chosen and used to assign a number to each column in the rectangle to determine the order of rearrangement. The number corresponding to the letters in the key is determined by their place in the alphabet, i.e. A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, etc. For example, if the key word is CAT and the message is THE SKY IS BLUE, the message would be arranged thus:

 C A T
 3 1 20
 T H E
 S K Y
 I S B
 L U E

Next, the letters are taken in numerical order and that is how the message is transposed. The column under A is taken first, then the column under C, then the column under T, as a result the message &quot;The sky is blue&quot; has become: HKSUTSILEYBE

In the Chinese cipher&#x27;s method of transposing, the letters of the message are written from right to left, down and up columns to scramble the letters. Then, starting in the first row, the letters are taken in order to get the new ciphertext. For example, if the message needed to be enciphered was THE DOG RAN FAR, the Chinese cipher would look like this:

 R R G T
 A A O H
 F N D E

The cipher text then reads: RRGT AAOH FNDE

Many transposition ciphers are similar to these two examples, usually involving rearranging the letters into rows or columns and then taking them in a systematic way to transpose the letters. Other examples include the Vertical Parallel and the Double Transposition Cipher.

More complex algorithms can be formed by mixing substitution and transposition in a product cipher; modern block ciphers such as DES iterate through several stages of substitution and transposition.

=== Concealment ciphers ===
Put simply, a concealment, or null, cipher is any cipher which involves a number of &quot;nulls,&quot; or decoy letters. A null cipher could be plaintext words with nulls placed in designated areas or even a plaintext message broken up in different positions with a null at the end of each word. However, a message with only a couple nulls (for example, one at the beginning and one at the end) is &quot;not&quot; a null cipher.

For example, during England&#x27;s Civil War Royalist Sir John Trevanian was aided in his escape from a Puritan castle in Colchester by this message:WORTHIE SIR JOHN, HOPE, THAT IS YE BESTE COMFORT OF YE AFFLICTED, CANNOT MUCH, I FEAR ME, HELP YOU NOW. THAT I WOULD SAY TO YOU, IS THIS ONLY: IF EVER I MAY BE ABLE TO REQUITE THAT I DO OWE YOU, STAND NOT UPON ASKING ME. TIS NOT MUCH THAT I CAN DO; BUT WHAT I CAN DO, BEE YE VERY SURE I WILL. I KNOW THAT, IF DETHE COMES, IF ORDINARY MEN FEAR IT, IT FRIGHTS NOT YOU, ACCOUNTING IT FOR A HIGH HONOUR, TO HAVE SUCH A REWARDE OF YOUR LOYALTY. PRAY YET YOU MAY BE SPARED THIS SOE BITTER, CUP. I FEAR NOT THAT YOU WILL GRUDGE ANY SUFFERINGS; ONLY IF BIE SUBMISSIONS YOU CAN TURN THEM AWAY, TIS THE PART OF A WISE MAN. TELL ME, AN IF YOU CAN, TO DO FOR YOU ANYTHINGE THAT YOU WOLDE HAVE DONE. THE GENERAL GOES BACK ON WEDNESDAY. RESTINGE YOUR SERVANT TO COMMAND.The third letter after each punctuation reveals &quot;Panel at East end of Chapel slides&quot;.

A dot or pinprick null cipher is a common classical encryption method in which dot or pinprick is placed above or below certain letters in a piece of writing. An early reference to this was when Aeneas Tacticus wrote about it in his book &quot;On the Defense of Fortifications.&quot;

==Cryptanalysis of classical ciphers==
Classical ciphers are commonly quite easy to break. Many of the classical ciphers can be broken even if the attacker only knows sufficient ciphertext and hence they are susceptible to a ciphertext-only attack. Some classical ciphers (e.g., the Caesar cipher) have a small key space. These ciphers can be broken with a brute force attack, that is by simply trying out all keys. Substitution ciphers can have a large key space, but are often susceptible to a frequency analysis, because for example frequent letters in the plaintext language correspond to frequent letters in the ciphertexts. Polyalphabetic ciphers such as the Vigenère cipher prevent a simple frequency analysis by using multiple substitutions. However, more advanced techniques such as the Kasiski examination can still be used to break these ciphers.

On the other hand, modern ciphers are designed to withstand much stronger attacks than ciphertext-only attacks. A good modern cipher must be secure against a wide range of potential attacks including known-plaintext attacks and chosen-plaintext attacks as well as chosen-ciphertext attacks. For these ciphers an attacker should not be able to find the key even if they know any amount of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext and even if they could select plaintext or ciphertext themselves. Classical ciphers do not satisfy these much stronger criteria and hence are no longer of interest for serious applications.

Some techniques from classical ciphers can be used to strengthen modern ciphers. For example, the MixColumns step in AES is a Hill cipher.

<text>In English criminal law, attainder was the metaphorical &quot;stain&quot; or &quot;corruption of blood&quot; which arose from being condemned for a serious capital crime (felony or treason). It entailed losing not only one&#x27;s life, property and hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one&#x27;s heirs. Anyone condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.

Attainder by confession resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the coroner in sanctuary. Attainder by verdict resulted from conviction by jury. Attainder by process resulted from a legislative act outlawing a fugitive (a bill of attainder). The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been abolished.

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==

Medieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit their lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted&#x27;s family.

Monarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king&#x27;s position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try commoners, including torture. Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.

Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, Henry VI reversed all 21 attainders, Edward IV 86 of 120, and Richard III 99 of 100. However, this changed with Henry VII, as described below.

Rulers who used attainder include:
* Margaret of Anjou: her attainder of Richard of York led him to invade England and attempt to seize the throne after the Battle of Northampton, which led to the penultimate phases of the War of the Roses.
* Edward IV: used attainder after killing his brother, George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence for high treason. 
* Henry VII: initially attainted men after he ascended the throne. He used the threat of attainder as a means to keep the few nobles who survived the War of the Roses in line. Often, however, he would penalize them with exorbitant fees and fines, or force them to have bonds which would be forfeit unless they exhibited good behaviour (his goal was to reduce the number of nobles with private armies of retainers). Henry VII attainted 138 men, of whom he reversed only 46 attainders, and some of these were conditional.
* Henry VIII: compelled parliament to attaint many nobles during his lifetime, including magnates with major land holdings, and any magnates whom he came to mistrust. Examples include:
**Anne Boleyn: Before her execution, she was stripped of her title, and her marriage was annulled.
** Catherine Howard: Henry VIII had an Act of Attainder passed against Catherine Howard, which made it treason for a woman with an unchaste reputation to marry the king.
** Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, one of the wealthiest magnates in England, whom Henry had executed on flimsy charges in 1521.
** Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury: One of the last surviving noble Plantagenets of senior line.
** Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey: The poet son of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk.
** Thomas Cromwell: former Principal Secretary to Henry VIII, who was arrested at a Privy Council meeting in 1540, and charged with treason, executed on the grounds of an Attainder
* Charles I: subsequent to the failed impeachment of his former Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, was attainted during the political crisis of 1640 -1641. The Bill of Attainder, having passed the depleted House of Commons and House of Lords, was enacted by Charles I as a concession to his political opponents. During his reign, the Long Parliament of 1641 passed an Act of Attainder against William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury who was beheaded in 1645.

* Charles II: Although deceased by the time of the Restoration, the regicides John Bradshaw, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and Thomas Pride were served with a Bill of Attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 (NS).

* William III: 
** James, III and VIII, the Old Pretender, 1702
** Lewis Crichton, 4th Viscount Frendraught, in 1690
* George II, following the Jacobite rising of 1745:
** Attainder of Earl of Kellie and Others Act 1745

Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including torture and methods of execution. For example, commoners could be burned at the stake, whereas nobles could not.

Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person&#x27;s &quot;destruction&quot;.

==Passage in Parliament==
In the Westminster system, a bill of attainder was a bill passed by Parliament to attaint persons who were accused of high treason, or, in rare cases, a lesser crime. A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; one use of the attainder process was a method of declaring a person a fugitive. Another was applying collateral consequences of criminal conviction (especially property forfeiture) where the suspects had died and hence could not stand trial.

A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against Thomas Jefferson was raised in 1774 following his authorship of &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot;.

The last bill of attainder passed in Britain was against Lord Edward FitzGerald, after his death in 1798; that provided for forfeiture of his estate. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the Forfeiture Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict., c.23).

Article One of the United States Constitution provides that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed by Congress, and forbids states from passing them.

==Corruption of blood==

Corruption of blood is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or through their other relatives from them. For example, if a person executed for a crime leaves innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal&#x27;s innocent parent outlives their child, the property inherited by the parent from the criminal cannot be inherited by the criminal&#x27;s children either; instead, it will be distributed among other family members.

The United States Constitution prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason, (specifically, &quot;no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted&quot;) 
and when Congress passed the first federal crime bill in 1790, it prohibited corruption of blood as a punishment for any federal crime. In England and Wales, corruption of blood was abolished by the Corruption of Blood Act 1814.

== Examples==

* Earl of Strafford
* John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln
* Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven
* Parker Wickham
* Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel
* Thomas Cromwell
* Earl of Perth
** Viscount Strathallan
* Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick

<text>Carmen Joan Duncan (7 July 1942 – 3 February 2019) was an Australian-born stage and screen actress and activist, with a career locally and internationally in the United States that spanned over 50 years.

She was nominated for the AFI Award for Best Actress for the 1980 film &quot;Harlequin&quot;, and was also known for the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You&quot;. Her other film appearances include &quot;Touch and Go&quot; (1980) and &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; (1982). She played Iris Wheeler in the American soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; from 1988 to 1994.

Duncan appeared in numerous theatre roles between 1970 and 2015.

==Early life and career==
Duncan was born in Cooma, New South Wales, in 1942. She graduated in 1961 from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in Sydney. Duncan was known to Australian audiences as a character actress in television, stage and films, as well as having appeared in television commercials. Her television roles included the series &quot;Hunter&quot; (1967) and she appeared in the evening soap opera &quot;Number 96&quot; playing Helen Sheridan in 1973. A role on the soap &quot;Certain Women&quot; followed. She later had an ongoing role in &quot;Skyways&quot;, and guest starred in several episodes of &quot;A Country Practice&quot; as Terence Elliott&#x27;s wife, Rowena. Her film roles included &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot; (1982) and its 2014 reboot.

Duncan emigrated to the United States in the 1980s, where she acted on television. From October 1988 to September 1994, she portrayed Iris Carrington Wheeler on the American daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. She succeeded Beverlee McKinsey in the role after a long absence. Many of her critics, including &quot;TV Guide&quot; Michael Logan, remarked that her accent sounded less American than her counterparts, making her seem out of place in the serial. As an actress, she generally used a Cultivated Australian accent, which is similar to Received Pronunciation.

After leaving the &quot;Another World&quot; role in the mid-1990s, Duncan returned to Australia, where she acted in guest roles on television series and lampooned her former soap opera image on television commercials. In 2000, she was diagnosed and treated for early stage breast cancer. In 2003, she appeared as Anna Denton on &quot;CrashBurn&quot;. In 2004, she returned to the United States to fill in for Eileen Fulton as Lisa Grimaldi in three episodes of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; while Fulton was on emergency medical leave. Duncan became a member of Actor&#x27;s Equity in 1962 and the federal council of the Media and Entertainment Arts Alliance.

==Activism==
Duncan retired from acting in 2006 and became a fundraising manager for the GO Fund, a New South Wales charity associated with gynaecological cancer. She served as an ambassador for the Breast Care Centre at the Royal Hospital for Women. 

==Personal life ==
Duncan lived in Sydney. She had two children. Her younger sister is actress Paula Duncan.

Carmen Duncan died on 3 February 2019 from breast cancer, aged 76.

<doc id="705910" wikidata="Q389375" url="?curid=705910" title="Marie Belloc Lowndes">
<text>Marie Adelaide Elizabeth Rayner Lowndes (née Belloc; 5 August 1868 – 14 November 1947), who wrote as Marie Belloc Lowndes, was a prolific English novelist, and sister of author Hilaire Belloc.

Active from 1898 until her death, she had a reputation for combining exciting incidents with psychological interest in her books. Four of her works were adapted for the screen: &quot;The Chink in the Armour&quot; (1912; adapted 1922), &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1913; adapted several times), &quot;Letty Lynton&quot; (1931; adapted 1932), and &quot;The Story of Ivy&quot; (1927; adapted 1947). &quot;The Lodger&quot; was also adapted as a 1940 radio drama and 1960 opera.

==Personal life==

Born in George Street, Marylebone, London and raised in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France, Belloc was the only daughter of French barrister Louis Belloc and English feminist Bessie Parkes. Her younger brother was Hilaire Belloc, whom she wrote of in her last work, &quot;The Young Hilaire Belloc&quot; (published posthumously in 1956). 

Belloc&#x27;s paternal grandfather was the French painter Jean-Hilaire Belloc, and her maternal great-great-grandfather was the theologian/philosopher Joseph Priestley. Her mother died in 1925, 53 years after her father.

In 1896, Belloc married Frederick Sawrey A. Lowndes (1868–1940), a journalist. They had one son and two daughters, the elder of whom married the Earl of Iddesleigh.

==Career==
She published a biography, &quot;H.R.H. The Prince of Wales: An Account of His Career&quot;, in 1898. From then on novels, reminiscences and plays appeared at the rate of one per year until 1946. She produced over forty novels in all - mainly mysteries, well-plotted and on occasion based on real-life crime, though she herself resented being classed as a crime writer. She created the French detective Hercules Popeau, roughly contemporaneously to Agatha Christie&#x27;s creation of Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Popeau appeared in two novels and a series of short stories.

Her mother died in 1925, fifty-three years after her father. In the memoir, &quot;I, too, Have Lived in Arcadia,&quot; published in 1942, she told the story of her mother&#x27;s life, compiled largely from old family letters and her own memories of her early life in France. A second autobiography &quot;Where love and friendship dwelt&quot; appeared posthumously in 1948.

Ernest Hemingway praised her insight into female psychology, revealed above all in the situation of the ordinary mind failing to cope with the impact of the extraordinary.

==Death==
Belloc died 14 November 1947 at the home of her elder daughter, the Countess Iddesleigh (wife of the third Earl) in Eversley Cross, Hampshire, and was interred in France, in La Celle-Saint-Cloud near Versailles, where she had spent her youth.

The second was Maurice Elvey&#x27;s (1932), followed by John Brahm&#x27;s (1944), &quot;Man in the Attic&quot; (1953), and David Ondaatje&#x27;s (2009).

<doc id="705921" wikidata="Q2911615" url="?curid=705921" title="Fallacies of illicit transference">
<text>A fallacy of illicit transference is an informal fallacy occurring when an argument assumes there is no difference between a term in the &quot;distributive&quot; (referring to every member of a class) and &quot;collective&quot; (referring to the class itself as a whole) sense.

There are two variations of this fallacy:

* Fallacy of composition – assumes what is true of the parts is true of the whole. This fallacy is also known as &quot;arguing from the specific to the general.&quot;
:&quot;Since Judy is so diligent in the workplace, this entire company must have an amazing work ethic.&quot;
* Fallacy of division – assumes what is true of the whole is true of its parts (or some subset of parts). In statistics, forms of it are usually referred to as the ecological fallacy.
:&quot;Because this company is so corrupt, so must every employee within it be corrupt.&quot;

While fallacious, arguments that make these assumptions may be persuasive because of the representativeness heuristic.

<doc id="705925" wikidata="Q839341" url="?curid=705925" title="Far and Away">
<text>Far and Away is a 1992 American epic Western romantic adventure drama film directed by Ron Howard from a screenplay by Bob Dolman and a story by Howard and Dolman. It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. This was the last cinematography credit for Mikael Salomon before he moved on to a directing career. The music score was by John Williams. It was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

Cruise and Kidman, who were married at the time, play Irish immigrants seeking their fortune in the 1890s America, eventually taking part in the Land Run of 1893.

This was Cyril Cusack&#x27;s final film before his death the following year.

==Plot==
In 1892 Ireland, tenant farmers work land they could never own and pay unfairly high rents to their wealthy landlords. Joseph Donnelly dreams of owning his own land. After his father dies, their family home is burned down by their landlord Daniel Christie&#x27;s men, due to unpaid rent. Joseph travels to Daniel&#x27;s home to kill him in revenge, but he only injures himself. Daniel&#x27;s wife, Nora, and his daughter, Shannon, nurse Joseph back to health so that he can be hanged for the attempted murder.

Nora tries to mold Shannon into a refined lady, but Shannon often rebels. She reveals to Joseph that she aspires to go to America, where land is being given away. When Joseph tries to flee the Christie home, he gets into a confrontation with Stephen Chase, the Christies&#x27; financial manager, who challenges him to a duel. The next morning, Shannon runs away from home, convinces Joseph to come with her as her servant and protector, and saves him from the duel.

On a ship bound for America, Shannon and Joseph meet Mr. McGuire, who confirms Shannon&#x27;s story about land being given away in Oklahoma. He adds that they will have to travel a thousand miles to get there and must claim their desired land in a race. Shannon divulges that she has a collection of silver spoons that will cover the expenses needed to get to Oklahoma.

Upon their arrival in Boston, McGuire is shot in the street, and Shannon loses her spoons. Mike Kelly, an Irish ward boss, finds jobs for Joseph and Shannon and gives them a room to rent. Joseph also becomes a regular in bare-knuckle boxing matches at Kelly&#x27;s club to make extra cash. Over the following weeks, Joseph and Shannon struggle to earn money and adapt to their new living situation. Romantic tension flares between them, especially after Grace, a dancer at Kelly&#x27;s club, shows interest in Joseph, making Shannon jealous.

One night, Joseph discovers that Shannon has gone to Kelly&#x27;s club to dance burlesque and earn extra money. When he storms in to take her home, Kelly and the other Irishmen there beg him to fight an Italian contender, promising to split the two-hundred-dollar winnings with him if he triumphs. Joseph is winning the fight until he notices one of his backers groping Shannon. He pushes through the crowd to free her but is pushed back into the ring, where he is defeated by a sucker punch while distracted. As payback for the loss, Kelly and his men take all of the money the couple had saved and throw Shannon and Joseph out into the streets.

Cold and starving, the pair stay in a seemingly abandoned house. They share a tender moment and a kiss before the owners of the house return and chase them away, shooting Shannon in the back. Joseph, knowing the Christies are looking for her in Boston, brings Shannon to where they are staying. Deciding she will be better cared for by them, he leaves despite his feelings for her, heading west to the Ozarks and finding work laying train track. Months pass, and one day he sees a wagon train. Knowing it is headed for Oklahoma, Joseph abandons the railroad and joins the wagon train, arriving in time for the Land Run of 1893.

Joseph finds Shannon, Stephen, and the Christies already in Oklahoma. Stephen, having seen Joseph talking to Shannon, threatens to kill him if he goes near her again. During the landrace, Joseph outpaces everyone, catching up to Shannon and Stephen. But before Joseph can plant his claim flag, a fight breaks out between him and Stephen, ending with Joseph being crushed by Stephen&#x27;s horse. Shannon runs to Joseph&#x27;s side and rejects Stephen when he objects to her actions. Joseph professes his love for Shannon and seems to die but is revived when she reciprocates his love. They then drive his flag into the ground and claim their land together.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot in Montana for business reasons, but the Oklahoma Historical Society was involved in its production. Imagine Production Co. toured the areas around Montana for a week. They visited different areas before selecting Billings, Montana. Ron Howard, whose film &quot;Backdraft&quot; was in the stages of being released in theatres at the time, arrived in Billings to begin the groundwork for the film. One site outside of town was a ranch, which was going to be used to film the Oklahoma Land Rush scene. Working titles for the film included &quot;The Irish Story&quot; and &quot;An Irish Story&quot;.

Principal photography began in Montana on May 28, 1991. After several weeks of preparation, the cast and crew filmed the Oklahoma Land Rush scene on July 7, 1991. Eight hundred riders and extras, nine hundred horses, mule, oxen, and two hundred wagons were used on a quarter-mile wide set. Nine cameras were used to film the action sequences. During the filming of the scene, four people broke bones and one horse died. Cruise&#x27;s boxing match was filmed at the Billings Depot. Local area residents were used as extras for the sequence. American Humane reported that &quot;The production company not only met American Humane&#x27;s Guidelines, but went that extra mile to ensure both the physical and mental wellness of the animals.&quot;
After filming wrapped in Billings, the cast and crew traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to complete filming. Ardmore Studios in Wicklow was used to film interior sequences, and the streets of Boston were filmed in Dublin.

It was the first film shot in Panavision Super 70 and the first film to be shot in 70mm in a decade since &quot;Tron&quot; (1982). The Arriflex 765 camera was also used, as the camera was capable of 100 frames per second which was used for slow-motion shots during the Oklahoma land rush scene.

==Soundtrack==


The music to &quot;Far and Away&quot; was composed and conducted by John Williams. The score, a mixture of traditional Irish instrumentation and conventional orchestra, prominently featured performances by the Irish musical group The Chieftains and a revision of the song &quot;Book of Days&quot; composed and performed by Enya. The soundtrack was released on 26 May 1992 through MCA Records and features 19 tracks of music at a running time of just over 67 minutes. Selections from the soundtrack have been featured in the trailers for various films including &quot;Rudy&quot; (1993), &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot; (1994), &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; (1995), &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002) and &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot; (2006).

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 50% based on reviews from 38 critics. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Handsome and simplistic, &quot;Far and Away&quot; has the beauty of an American epic without the breadth.&quot; 
On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. 
Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert praised the film&#x27;s cinematography while criticizing its script: 
Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;handsomely mounted and amiably performed but leisurely and without much dramatic urgency.&quot;

Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Far and Away&quot;... is the director&#x27;s attempt to step into the cinematic shoes of directors John Ford and David Lean. And, certainly, he&#x27;s stepped into something with this sprawling, old-fashioned melodrama.&quot;

Writer Tony Parsons called it &quot;a stinker of a picture...which was far and away the worst film I have ever seen.&quot;
The film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for the song &quot;Book of Days&quot;.

<doc id="705932" wikidata="Q441563" url="?curid=705932" title="Edward J. King">
<text>Edward Joseph King (May 11, 1925 – September 18, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 66th Governor of Massachusetts from 1979 to 1983. A member of the Democratic Party until 1985, he then became a member of the Republican Party. Elected in the 1978 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, he lost the Democratic primary of the 1982 election to his predecessor Michael Dukakis.

==Early life==
King was born on May 11, 1925, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. During his teens, King worked as a pinsetter in a Revere Beach bowling alley to help pay for his schooling. In World War II he served in the United States Navy. He was given a medical discharge due to a broken ankle.

==Athletic career==
King played college football for the Boston College Eagles football team from 1945 to 1947. He graduated from Boston College in 1948. He went on to play professional football in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) for the Buffalo Bills in 1948 and 1949 and in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Colts during the 1950 season. He appeared in a total of 31 AAFC and NFL games, including 11 as a starter. After the Colts folded, King was selected by the New York Yanks in the 22nd round (263rd overall pick) 1951 NFL draft but did not play for the Yanks.

==Massport==
After his athletic career, King took accounting and business courses at Bentley College. In 1953, he went to work for the accounting firm of Lybrand, Ross Bros., &amp; Montgomery. After performing an audit for the Museum of Science he was hired to serve as its assistant director and comptroller.

In 1959, King became comptroller for the newly formed Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport). On December 23, 1961, he was appointed the port authority&#x27;s secretary-treasurer. On June 18, 1963, he was named the Authority&#x27;s executive director.

During King&#x27;s tenure as executive director, Logan International Airport was transformed into a modern facility. Upgrades were made to the runways and terminals, and the Volpe International Terminal (Terminal E) was built. Under King&#x27;s watch, the authority went from a deficit to a surplus. However, he was criticized for ignoring the wishes of East Boston residents during airport expansion projects. His 1969 authorization of the destruction of Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s Wood Island Park by bulldozers and chainsaws while the city was still challenging the taking of the parkland in court solidified the public&#x27;s animosity. His critics also claim that the airport&#x27;s success was not due to King, but due to the success of the jet age. Massport also became known for providing legislators with jobs for their constituents, gifts, and no-bid contracts.

King was also responsible for initiating ferry service to Hingham with the intention of revitalizing the Hingham Shipyard property.

King had a poor relationship with the Massachusetts Port Authority Board of Directors, who wanted him to consult with the board before he proceeded with the expansion of the airport and other projects. On November 21, 1974, the board voted 4 to 2 to fire King.

==New England Council==
After his dismissal, King became president of the New England Council, a regional Chamber of commerce-like organization funded by business interests. In this position he performed a variety of duties, including lobbying the federal government for legislation to limit environment restrictions on business and coordinating an attempt to have the national solar energy research center located in New England.

==Governor==
On October 25, 1977, King announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Governor. A fiscal and social conservative, he ran as a pro-life candidate and supported capital punishment, offshore drilling, increased nuclear power, greater research on solar energy, less business regulation, raising the drinking age to 21, and mandatory sentences for drug dealers. King was able to raise more money than his opponents due to his support from the business community. He focused his spending on extensive media advertising while his main primary opponent, incumbent Governor Michael Dukakis, spent more money on organization.

In September 1978, King defeated Dukakis in the Democratic primary. He then went on to defeat a liberal Republican, Massachusetts House Minority Leader Francis W. Hatch, Jr., in the November election.

During his term of office, King froze property taxes, reduced state spending on social programs, undertook a variety of efforts to encourage increased business and agricultural opportunities in the Commonwealth, introduced mandatory minimum sentences, and passed legislation to reintroduce the death penalty in Massachusetts, a measure which was later ruled unconstitutional by the state&#x27;s Supreme Judicial Court. When advocating capital punishment, President Ronald Reagan called King his &quot;favorite Democratic governor&quot; and King endorsed Reagan in the 1984 presidential election.

==Reelection campaign==

In 1982, while King sought a second term as Governor of Massachusetts, charges of corruption in the Massachusetts Revenue Department hampered his campaign to win the Democratic primary against previous Governor Michael Dukakis. Dukakis won the Democratic non-binding endorsement at the State Democratic Convention in May. By June, a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; poll put Dukakis&#x27;s support among likely Democratic primary voters at 68%, compared with King&#x27;s 20%.

In June 1982, Massachusetts State tax examiner Stanley J. Barczak was arrested for accepting a bribe. Barczak made claims of widespread corruption and agreed to become an informer for Francis X. Bellotti, the state&#x27;s Attorney General, in exchange for a suspended sentence without jail time. (Barczak&#x27;s testimony led to the trials of two other people, but his claim of widespread corruption was never proven in court.)

Barczak had served a five-year prison term, beginning in 1953, for tax fraud committed shortly after working at the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s Pittsburgh office. He had worked for Governor King in his 1978 campaign. After that election he had sought a position in the King administration, and one of his letters requesting employment was initialed by King and forwarded to his appointments office. Records showed that in 1981 he had an appointment to meet with Barczak, though King could not recall whether this meeting took place. Barczak was hired in January 1981 as a tax examiner for the Lowell district office.

King had appointed one of his old high school friends, John F. Coady, as deputy revenue commissioner. On July 21, 1982, King was informed that Coady had been implicated in a grand jury investigation of the department. On July 30, Coady was found at his home dead by means of suicide from hanging; he had rehired Barczak in 1982, after budget cuts in 1981 had resulted in Barczak being let go.

Revenue Commissioner Joyce Hampers had initially refused to turn over the subpoenaed tax records of 3,000 individuals to the Attorney General for the grand jury. She cited state laws on privacy and characterized the investigation as &quot;a fishing expedition&quot;. Gov. King worked out a compromise were the records of 195 individuals suspected of tax fraud would be turned over to the grand jury.

Hampers went on to insinuate that a nighttime break-in at her office (where some sensitive records had been stolen, but none connected to the investigation) had been ordered by his chief prosecutor Stephen Delinsky. She accused him of being motivated in his actions out of favoring Dukakis&#x27; campaign.

In response to Hampers unfounded accusations, Gov. King ordered her to stop making public statements. Delinsky charged that Hampers had tried to use state police to confiscate sensitive records held by Barczak (only prevented from doing so by the intervention of state troopers guarding him). Hampers responded saying she had only sent them to collect Barczak&#x27;s revenue department credentials. Delinsky told reporters he would have the grand jury consider whether the incident was obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness.

Hampers was also under media scrutiny for being forced, along with her physician and industrialist husband, to pay $16,818 plus interest in Federal back taxes when a court disallowed an elaborate tax shelter they had established.

The scandal hurt King&#x27;s campaign just as it seemed he might gain on Dukakis due to a $1 million ad campaign boasting of his efforts to cut taxes and get tough on drunken drivers.

Dukakis, focusing on the charges of corruption in the Revenue Department and calling King a &quot;cheerleader for Reaganomics&quot;, defeated the governor in the primaries and took the Democratic nomination.

==Post-political career==
Following his term of office, Governor King joined the public relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton. In 1985, he switched his party affiliation to the Republican Party and considered running for governor in 1986 on the Republican ticket. He endorsed George H.W. Bush during the 1988 presidential election. Until the time of his death he maintained residences in both Massachusetts and Florida.

His wife Josephine died in 1995. He had two sons, Timothy and Brian. His brother Paul was a judge in the Massachusetts court system.

<text>The Hawai‘i Convention Center is a convention and exhibition center in Hawaii, located in Honolulu on the island of Oahu. The Hawaii Convention Center is the largest exhibition center of its type in the state. It is located directly to the west of the Waikiki district of Honolulu.

==Design and construction==
Construction of the building cost $200 million. The building offers of ballroom and exhibition floor space. It was completed in 1997 and opened in 1998. The Hawaii Convention Center is owned by the Hawaii Tourism Authority and managed by Los Angeles based company AEG Live.

The Hawaiʻi Convention Center was the largest &quot;design-build&quot; project undertaken by the State of Hawaiʻi. The bid process for the design began in 1994 with LMN Architects being chosen to design the building. Wimberly Allison Tong &amp; Goo was chosen to design the interior, incorporating historical Hawaiian quilt designs and nature based motifs throughout.

==Events==
Major events that take place at the Hawaii Convention Center include the annual First Hawaiian International Auto Show, the Miss Hawaii competition, the Honolulu Festival, Kawaii Kon and numerous other public and private events. On November 12–20, 2011, the Hawaii Convention Center hosted the culminating meetings of APEC United States 2011. An estimated 10,000 people arrived in Honolulu for the meetings.

The National Transportation Safety Board public hearing on the Korean Air Flight 801 crash in Guam was held at the Hawaii Convention Center on March 24–26, 1998, in Ballrooms A, B, and C.

On May 7, 2024, it was announced that Game Changer Wrestling would hold a live pay-per-view show at the Convention Center on November 2, 2024. 

===Sporting events===
The convention center offers 28 volleyball and badminton courts, 18 basketball courts and 11 futsal (indoor soccer) courts for sports competitions.

The 2024 Pokémon World Championships were held at the Convention Center between August 16-18. It was the third video game World Championships held in Hawaii after 2010 and 2012 were held in Waikoloa Village, Hawaii.

==Awards==
The center has won the &quot;Prime Site Award&quot; for twelve-year consecutive years. In 2010, it won an &quot;Inner Circle Award&quot; in the category of &quot;Top Convention Centers&quot;. The Center won a &quot;Best in Business Travel&quot; award in the category of &quot;Best Conference or Convention Center/City&quot; The International Association of Exhibitions and Events (IAEE) voted the Hawai‘i Convention Center as the most beautiful convention center in the world.

==In popular culture==
In the television show &quot;Lost&quot;, the convention center was used to portray Sydney Airport in multiple instances. It was also featured in an episode of the new Hawaii Five-0 as hosting a fictional convention similar to San Diego Comic-Con.

It was also used as the Hilton Hotel Lobby and Monorail Station in Jurassic World (2015).

<doc id="705934" wikidata="Q2893176" url="?curid=705934" title="Existential fallacy">
<text>The existential fallacy, or [[existential instantiation]], is a formal fallacy. In the existential fallacy, one presupposes that a class has members when one is not supposed to do so; i.e., when one should not assume existential import. Not to be confused with the &#x27;Affirming the consequent&#x27;, as in &quot;If A, then B. B. Therefore A&quot;.

One example would be: &quot;Every unicorn has a horn on its forehead&quot;. It does not imply that there are any unicorns at all in the world, and thus it cannot be assumed that, if the statement were true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on its forehead). The statement, if assumed true, implies only that if there were any unicorns, each would definitely have a horn on its forehead.

==Overview==
An existential fallacy is committed in a medieval categorical syllogism because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, an assumption which is not established by the premises.

In modern logic, the presupposition that a class has members is seen as unacceptable. In 1905, Bertrand Russell wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Existential Import of Proposition&quot;, in which he called this Boolean approach &quot;Peano&#x27;s interpretation&quot;.

The fallacy does not occur in enthymemes, where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class.

==Examples==
* All trespassers will be prosecuted.
* Therefore, some of those prosecuted will have trespassed.

This is a fallacy because the first statement does not require the existence of any actual trespassers (stating only what would happen if some do exist), and therefore does not prove the existence of any. Note that this is a fallacy whether or not anyone has trespassed.

* Affirming the consequent
* Quantifier (logic)

<doc id="705939" wikidata="Q4767516" url="?curid=705939" title="Anna Stuart">
<text>Anna Stuart (born November 1, 1948, in Bluefield, West Virginia) is an American actress. She has primarily played roles in daytime serials.

== Career ==
Stuart began her career on &quot;The Doctors&quot; as lab technician Toni Ferra, a role she played from February 5, 1971 to September 30, 1976. Her character was involved in a triangle with Dr. Mike Powers and Dr. Alan Stewart. She followed up her work on &quot;The Doctors&quot; originating the role of Dr. Gina Dante Lansing on rival serial &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1977–1978) where she was reunited with her former &quot;The Doctors&quot; co-star Gerald Gordon who played her brother, Dr. Mark Dante.

In 1981, she filled in for Maeve Kinkead on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Vanessa Chamberlain while Kinkead was on maternity leave. It was during this time that Vanessa was a prime suspect in the murder of Diane Ballard. This was Stuart&#x27;s first time playing a schemer on the soaps, and led to playing other sophisticated trouble-makers on practically every New York based soap.

===&quot;Another World&quot; ===
Stuart is best known for her role as Donna Love Hudson on &quot;Another World&quot;, which she played from January 1983 to November 1986 and again from February 1989 to the show&#x27;s final episode in June 1999. The role of Donna Love was written as a very complex society snob, interfering in the love life of her brother Peter and dating Iris&#x27;s ex-husband, Bay City mayor Brian Bancroft. At first a supporting character, Donna was slowly made a lead as she became involved in a triangle with ex-husband Carl Hutchins and flashy novelist Felicia Gallant. Her storyline became more complex when it was revealed that not only was her sister Marley really her illegitimate daughter, but she&#x27;d also given birth to Marley&#x27;s twin, Victoria, as well. As Stuart became more popular, a major romance was created for her with Michael Hudson (Kale Browne) who was Victoria and Marley&#x27;s father.

When Stuart left the show in 1986, the role of Donna was recast with Philece Sampler, previously of the serial &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in the early 1980s. Two years later, Sampler&#x27;s contract was terminated when Stuart expressed interest in returning to &quot;Another World&quot;. Her return was highlighted by her appearance of the show&#x27;s 25th-anniversary &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; cover.

Stuart took medical sabbaticals from her role as Donna in 1990 and 1993, during which former &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Sofia Landon briefly played the role. In the early 1990s, Donna began a May–December romance with Matthew Cory (Matt Crane), which proved to be very popular. As the 1990s went on, however, the character was written in such a way that longtime viewers no longer recognized Donna. Stuart was quoted in &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; after &quot;Another World&quot;&#x27;s cancellation as saying that if the show had not been canceled in 1999, she would have left the role due to her disapproval regarding her character&#x27;s direction. When Michael Hudson was killed off in 1997, Donna&#x27;s behavior became particularly bizarre with the character blaming her daughter Victoria for causing Michael&#x27;s death.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation, Stuart and several other cast members played their characters on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Stuart&#x27;s appearance was to have lasted for two episodes in order to help introduce the character of Jake McKinnon to the show, but she ended up recurring on the show for almost three years as Donna paid Jake occasional visits after the death of his wife Victoria. Her final appearance in April 2002 took place when Jake was suddenly killed off, with Marley (Ellen Wheeler) and Donna taking Jake and Victoria&#x27;s children back to Bay City with them.

===Post-&quot;Another World&quot; ===

In April 2002, Stuart filled in for former &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Linda Dano as Gretel Rae Cummings on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; while Dano was on sick leave.

Immediately following this, Stuart began the role of Mary Smythe (Greenlee&#x27;s neglectful and self-centered mother) on &quot;All My Children&quot; where she played opposite former Another World castmate Mark Pinter. She is one of the few actors to have appeared on three soap operas in one calendar year. Intended to be written in for only a short length of time, the character became integral in a plotline in which Mary revealed that Jackson Montgomery was Greenlee&#x27;s natural father, making her the latest in the long line of rivals to that show&#x27;s reigning queen, Erica Kane. Mary had a brief romance with Adam Chandler before disappearing off the canvas in 2005. She returned to the show for two episodes in 2009.

In 2010, Stuart debuted on the internet based soap opera &quot;Gotham&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stuart married actor James Cromwell on January 1, 2014, at the home of her former &quot;Another World&quot; co-star Charles Keating.

<text>Alan &quot;Ollie&quot; Gelfand (born January 1, 1963) is an American skateboarder, racing driver, and businessman credited with inventing the ollie, the foundational skateboarding trick.

== Early life ==
Alan Gelfand was born in New York City, and is Jewish. Gelfand moved to Hollywood, Florida with his family in 1972. He started skateboarding in 1974 after his father bought him his first skateboard.

== Skateboarding career ==

=== Invention of the ollie ===
Named by Thrasher Magazine as &quot;The Founding Father of A Generation&quot;, Alan Gelfand&#x27;s invention of the ollie changed the face of skateboarding. His initial performance of the trick in 1976 at Skateboard USA in Hollywood, Florida, was serendipitous, stemming from the imperfect construction of the skatepark itself. Gelfand explained that the park&#x27;s poorly constructed features inadvertently led to his groundbreaking discovery. &quot;It was all by accident. The park was built so poorly that many of the features were over vertical and uneven. There was a part of the pool run where, when you skated it, you went out, caught air, and because it was over vertical, the board would pitch back towards your legs. You&#x27;d bend your knees back in and the board would come back to you. It was all by accident, really,&quot; Gelfand recalled. He began applying this technique to various elements, further refining his approach. By 1979, during a visit to Winchester Skate Park in San Jose, he was perfecting the ollie, leading to it becoming a fundamental move in skateboarding.

This unintentional innovation, dubbed the &quot;trick of the century&quot; by Stacey Peralta, fundamentally changed skateboarding, transforming it from simple maneuvers to complex aerial dynamics. Gelfand was credited in the Oxford Dictionary of English, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the Webster&#x27;s Dictionary as being the inventor of the trick after it had previously been listed as &quot;unknown&quot;.

The trick involves a skateboarder snapping the tail of the board down while jumping to lift the board into the air without the use of hands.

Gelfand&#x27;s technique was first showcased in a detailed how-to feature in the January 1979 issue of SkateBoarder Magazine. Titled &quot;Special Tips on Progressive Aerials,&quot; the article described his method for executing the no-hand ollie air, providing a step-by-step guide that has influenced generations of skateboarders.

=== Professional achievements and contributions ===
Gelfand&#x27;s skateboarding prowess extended beyond the invention of the ollie. He competed in various significant events in the 1970s and 1980s, showcasing his skills across multiple countries on tour as the first member of the legendary Bones Brigade team put together by Stacey Peralta. The Bones Brigade was an elite team of skateboarders sponsored by Powell-Peralta, which included other legendary skateboarders like Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen, and was instrumental in the evolution and popularization of skateboarding. Their collective innovation and media exposure played a significant role in skateboarding&#x27;s transition from a niche hobby to a global phenomenon.

Gelfand&#x27;s competitive spirit was evident as he participated in and won numerous skateboarding contests globally. His tour and competition schedule in the late 1970s included events across Europe and South America, where he showcased the ollie and other complex maneuvers, further popularizing skateboarding as a sport.

Gelfand was entered into the Skateboarding Hall of Fame in 2013.

=== Competitions entered, touring and cultural impact ===
Throughout his career, Gelfand participated in numerous notable skateboarding competitions.

* 1980s Bones Brigade Tours: As a key member of the Bones Brigade, Gelfand participated in national and international tours, performing in exhibitions that popularized skateboarding globally.

During his tours, Gelfand&#x27;s style and technical skills left an indelible mark on the international skateboarding scene. He participated in significant events such as the Super Skate Show in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1979, which featured prominent skaters of the time and was a key venue for Gelfand to demonstrate the ollie to a wider audience. Rodney Mullen reported in skateboarding.com that event was the first time he and Gelfand performed the Pop Shove It trick.

== Racing career ==
After retiring from professional skateboarding, Gelfand transitioned into car racing, particularly focusing on Volkswagens. His racing career spanned from the late 1980s through the early 2000s, where he participated in various endurance races and showcased his driving skills.

=== Early Racing Career and Karting Achievements ===
Gelfand began his motorsport journey in 1982 by winning the South Florida Autocross Championship in the C Street Prepared (CSP) category. In 1985, he went on to win the Florida Grand Prix Karting Championship.

In 1986, Gelfand claimed the World Karting Association (WKA) Grand National Championship, setting lap records at three national tracks. He also competed in the Florida Oval Asphalt Karting Series, where he secured the fastest lap and pole position at the Grand Nationals.

His karting achievements established Gelfand as a versatile driver capable of excelling in various forms of racing.

=== Racing success ===
Gelfand achieved notable success in the Longest Day of Nelson 24 Hour Endurance Race for Showroom Stock Cars, held at the Nelson Ledges Road Course. He secured first place in this race for four consecutive years from 1990 to 1993, demonstrating his prowess in endurance racing.

==== Grand-Am Cup Series ====
Gelfand competed in the Grand-Am Cup Street Stock Series in 2001, participating in multiple races across different circuits:

Daytona International Speedway: Third and eighth positions in two different races.
Phoenix International Raceway: Fifth and twenty-first positions.
Homestead-Miami Speedway: Seventh position.

== Progression into automotive industry ==
Frequently working as a mechanic on the cars he raced, and those of his teammates, post-racing, Gelfand continued his involvement with automobiles by founding the German Car Depot in Hollywood, Florida. The business specializes in the repair and maintenance of German automobiles, reflecting his connection with automotive engineering and mechanics.

=== Automotive Business - German Car Depot ===
Gelfand opened the German Car Depot, an auto repair shop specializing in German automobiles, located in Hollywood, Florida. The shop, established after a rebranding from VW Depot due to a trademark dispute, now operates with eight bays and serves hundreds of cars monthly, generating multi million dollar revenues.

== Entry into the dictionary ==
Alan &quot;Ollie&quot; Gelfand&#x27;s name and contribution to skateboarding were immortalized when the term &quot;ollie,&quot; was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. This inclusion not only acknowledges his invention but cements his legacy within the English language as both a noun and an intransitive verb. This recognition highlights the widespread impact of his innovation on skateboarding and popular culture, illustrating how a sport&#x27;s technical term can become embedded in everyday language. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary still lists the origin of the word as unknown, despite all other editions crediting Gelfand.

=== Legal battles and trademark issues ===
Gelfand has also been involved in legal actions to protect his intellectual property related to the ollie. He filed lawsuits against major companies, including Disney and Sega, for using the term &quot;ollie&quot; without permission, claiming infringement on his trademark rights.

== Filmography ==
Gelfand&#x27;s significant contributions to skateboarding have also been recognized in several documentary films, which explore the cultural and historical aspects of the sport. His participation in these films helps preserve the legacy of skateboarding&#x27;s evolution and his pivotal role within it.

=== &quot;Skateboard Madness&quot; (1980) ===
Gelfand appeared as a skateboarder in &quot;Skateboard Madness&quot;, a documentary that captures the vibrant skateboarding scene of the late 1970s. The film provides insight into the dynamics of skateboarding culture during a period of significant growth and innovation.

=== &quot;Bones Brigade: An Autobiography&quot; (2012) ===
In Bones Brigade: An Autobiography, directed by Stacy Peralta, Gelfand appears as himself. The documentary focuses on the history of the Bones Brigade, a legendary skateboarding team known for their influence on the sport in the 1980s. Gelfand&#x27;s firsthand account contributes to the narrative of the team&#x27;s pioneering impact on skateboarding.

=== &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; (2001) ===
Gelfand also featured in Dogtown and Z-Boys, another documentary by Stacy Peralta. Originally filmed in the 1970s, but released officially in 2001, these two films examine the skate and surf culture of 1970s Venice, California, highlighting the innovations brought by the Zephyr Skateboard Team. Gelfand&#x27;s involvement in the documentary underscores the revolutionary changes in skateboarding during this era, including his invention of the ollie which can be seen on video for the first time.

<text>Mount Cromwell is a mountain located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Cromwell lies two kilometres north of the east summit of Stutfield Peak. The mountain was named in 1972 by J. Monroe Thorington after Oliver Eaton (Tony) Cromwell, an American climber who made many first ascents in the Canadian Rockies.

The first ascent was made in 1936 by Oliver E. Cromwell, E. Cromwell jr., Francis S. North, and J. Monroe Thorington. Another source declares the ascent was made in 1938 by the same party but it included the guide Edward Feuz jr

In 2005, Bill Corbett, author of &quot;The 11,000ers of the Canadian Rockies,&quot; climbed to the top of Mount Cromwell. At the summit, his GPS registered 11,006 feet. So perhaps Mount Cromwell should be included in the list of the Canadian Rocky Mountains that are over 11,000 feet in elevation.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Cromwell is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below with wind chill factors below . Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Athabasca River.

==Geology==
The mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods and pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

<doc id="705949" wikidata="Q3236791" url="?curid=705949" title="Lester Horton">
<text>Lester Iradell Horton (January 23, 1906 – November 2, 1953) was an American dancer, choreographer, and teacher.

==Early years and education==
Lester Iradell Horton was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on January 23, 1906. His parents were Iradell and Pollyanna Horton.

His interest in dance was mainly stimulated by his fascination with American Indian culture after watching tribal dances in a Wild West show. He studied the Iroquois and Red River Indians, and Penobscot and Ojibwa tribes.

He studied ballet for two years with a local teacher in Indianapolis, Theo Hewes. At that time he also took classes at the Herron Art Institute and worked with the Indianapolis Little Theater.

Seeing a performance of the Denishawn company had a great impact on him.

==Career==
Horton arrived in California in 1927 to perform &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, a dance-pageant by Clara Bates based on Longfellow&#x27;s poem, at the Argus Bowl, a natural amphitheater in Little Rock.

He took a job with the sculptor Kathleen Stubergh, with whom he remained close for his lifetime. They produced wax figures and Horton painted faces on the window mannequins.

He chose to work in California instead of New York City, which was considered the center of modern dance at the time.

In 1931, Horton created his first solo concert choreography, &quot;Kootenai War Dance&quot;. That same year he was invited to perform this dance along with a new choreography &quot;Voodoo Ceremonial&quot; at the Los Angeles Olympics. His success garnered an invitation to perform at the Paramount Theatre on the same bill as Judy Garland and the Garland sisters for a two-week run. In 1932, Lester Horton formed his own dance company called the Lester Horton Dancers. That company evolved into what was briefly known as the Lester Horton California Ballets (1934) and then the Horton Dance Group (1934). The Horton Dance Group, billed in its film appearances as the Lester Horton Dancers, lasted until early 1944. Later, Horton attempted to develop a company on the East Coast for dancer Sonia Shaw, but Shaw&#x27;s husband stopped underwriting the venture and the company collapsed before it could give any public performances.

In 1946, after a brief hiatus, Horton formed the Dance Theater of Los Angeles with his longtime leading dancer, Bella Lewitzky. He purchased a location in West Hollywood for rehearsals, performances, and teaching. It was a school, a theater, and the first space in Los Angeles dedicated to modern dance. The partnership with Lewitzky ended when she left in 1950, but Horton&#x27;s final company continued until 1960 under the direction of Frank Eng.

In order to finance his school and various dance companies, Horton choreographed a number of Hollywood musicals, beginning with &quot;Moonlight in Havana&quot; (1942). Many of the films, like the Maria Montez vehicle &quot;White Savage&quot; (1943), were Universal productions, which could not rival the budgetary extravagance of MGM or Fox, though many were in Technicolor; the most notable was Arthur Lubin&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943). Horton&#x27;s dancers also frequently worked at clubs, including the Folies Bergère in New York and Earl Carroll Theatre and Restaurant in Los Angeles. Horton&#x27;s best-known works, which he called &quot;choreodramas,&quot; are &quot;Salome&quot; (which occupied Horton for nearly two decades) and &quot;The Beloved&quot;.

Dance Theater made only one appearance in New York, during the last year of Horton&#x27;s life. The troupe was scheduled to perform at the reputation-making theater of the Young Men&#x27;s and young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association on East Ninety-second street in New York City. Upon arriving the troupe discovered the venue did not provide publicity and so the performance was largely unknown and not well attended. Only about 300 people showed for the Saturday night performance and only about 200 tickets were sold for the Sunday matinee. This netted the company a total of 100 dollars. All but one of the reviews were good. One magazine praised the &quot;superb dancers&quot; but complained that &quot;one technical and effective stunt follows another with hardly ever any sustained choreographic continuity.&quot; There was not enough money to return home from New York and Horton had doubts about the company&#x27;s financial ability to attend Jacob&#x27;s Pillow later that summer. Horton&#x27;s agent wired Horton the money to get the troupe home. At the time, Horton was drinking heavily and was emotionally and physically ill. Upon returning to Los Angeles he moved into a house on Mulholland Drive where he was attended to by his parents and friends.

Determined to perform at the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow festival, the group travelled to the Berkshires by car. The show was a success, though Horton could not afford to accompany the troupe to the festival. Riding on their success at the festival, the troupe was asked to open for Johnny Desmond in the fall; they were so popular that they were invited back for another two-week engagement.

==Technique==
Horton developed his own approach to dance that incorporated diverse elements including Native American Folk Dance, Japanese arm gestures, Javanese and Balinese isolations for the upper body, particularly the eyes, head and hands. Horton also included Afro-Caribbean elements, like hip circles. 

Horton&#x27;s dance technique, which is now commonly known as &quot;Horton Technique&quot;, has no style, per se. The technique emphasizes a whole body, anatomical approach to dance that includes flexibility, strength, coordination and body and spatial awareness to enable unrestricted, dramatic freedom of expression.

&quot;I am sincerely trying now to create a dance technique based entirely upon corrective exercises, created with a knowledge of human anatomy; a technique which will correct physical faults and prepare a dancer for any type of dancing he may wish to follow; a technique having all the basic movements which govern the actions of the body; combined with a knowledge of the origin of movement and a sense of artistic design.&quot;
-Lester Horton, in a letter to Dorathi Bock Pierre, &quot;From Primitive to Modern,&quot; American Dancer (October 1937)

==Death and legacy==
Horton died of a heart attack at his home on November 2, 1953.

Alvin Ailey briefly ran the company following Horton&#x27;s death, but eventually moved to New York City, where in 1969 the Horton Technique became standard training for students at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center.

Since Horton&#x27;s death, his dance technique and choreography have become widely known and practiced. Horton&#x27;s legacy has survived through the www.lhdt.org Lester Horton Dance Theater Foundation, Inc., which is dedicated to preserving and promoting Horton&#x27;s contributions as a dancer, choreographer, and educator. Also, various dance companies such as the Joyce Trisler Danscompany focus on Horton&#x27;s technique,&quot;, as well as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and School.

==Notable students==
James Truitte was later an authority on Horton&#x27;s technique and choreography, and taught at University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music.

Other figures who emerged from Horton&#x27;s school and company include actress Lelia Goldoni and Sondra Kerr Blake. The founder of the Mattachine Society, Harry Hay, had a daughter who took classes at the dance theater. Janet Collins, a twenty-year-old ballet student (who would go on to be the first African American dancer to perform full-time with the Metropolitan Opera in New York) was one of the students approached by Horton to perform in exchange for free classes. Collins enthusiastically agreed, and yet admitted to Horton that she knew &quot;nothing about modern dance.&quot; Horton told her not to worry—he would teach her.

Other past students included:

* Alvin Ailey
* Eleanor Brooks
* Janet Collins
* Rudi Gernreich
* William Dale Jennings
* Joan Kerr

<doc id="705954" wikidata="Q634550" url="?curid=705954" title="Rocky Mountain locust">
<text>The Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) is an extinct species of grasshopper that ranged through the western half of the United States and some western portions of Canada with large numbers seen until the end of the 19th century. Sightings often placed their swarms in numbers far larger than any other locust species, with one famous sighting in 1875 estimated at in size (greater than the area of California), weighing 27.5 million tons and consisting of some 12.5 trillion insects, the greatest concentration of animals ever recorded, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

Less than 30 years later, the species was apparently extinct. The last recorded sighting of a live specimen was in 1902 in southern Canada. As a creature so ubiquitous was not expected to become extinct, very few specimens were ever collected (though a few preserved remains have been found in Knife Point Glacier, Wyoming and Grasshopper Glacier, Montana).

Rocky Mountain locusts were a part of the diet of the critically endangered or possibly extinct northern curlew (&quot;Numenius borealis&quot;) on its spring migration and the extinction of the locust has been speculated as being a factor in the decline of the curlew.

==Taxonomy==
The species name was formally published with the Latin binomial &quot;Caloptenus spretus&quot; in 1866 by B.D. Walsh as named by &quot;Mr. Uhler, without describing it,&quot; adding that &quot;The name &#x27;spretus&#x27; means &#x27;despised&#x27;, and refers apparently to its having been hitherto despised or overlooked by Entomologists&quot;. Walsh does not provide a description of the species, except for female wing length, as well as some aspects of biology, ecology, and control. Some entomologists credit the authority for the binomial &quot;Caloptenus spretus&quot; to C. Thomas, but fails on the Principle of Priority. The treatment under the genus &quot;Melanoplus&quot; began in 1878 in publications by S. H. Scudder who pointed out the difference between the genus &quot;Caloptenus&quot; that he noted as being more correctly spelled &quot;Calliptenus&quot; and &quot;Melanoplus&quot;. 

The species is reported to have descended from the Rocky Mountains to the prairie in large numbers only in certain years, particularly in dry seasons, following westward wind currents. Outbreaks usually lasted two consecutive years. Although a great number of eggs were laid on the prairie during outbreak years, individuals hatched from these eggs usually did not thrive, a condition that has been attributed to the lack of adaptation of this species to prairie habitats. A 2004 molecular phylogenetic study that used mitochondrial DNA from specimens obtained from museums and fragments preserved in frozen glacial deposits confirms the placement in the genus &quot;Melanoplus&quot; and the distinctiveness as a species (i.e., not a migratory form of an extant species). It also identified the closest living relative as &quot;Melanoplus bruneri&quot; rather than &quot;M. sanguinipes&quot; as had been earlier surmised.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Rocky Mountain locust occurred along both sides of the Rocky Mountains and in most of the prairie areas. Breeding in sandy areas and thriving in hot and dry conditions, it has been hypothesized that they may have depended on the tall grass prairie plants during drier spells. The destruction of the prairie habitat and the incursion of new flora and fauna along with agricultural practices may have led to the extinction of the species. Large numbers of grasshoppers including a large number of Rocky Mountain locusts entombed in the ice in the Rocky Mountains gave their name to the Grasshopper Glacier.

==Extinction==
Rocky Mountain locusts became more of a problem in the 19th century, as farming expanded westward into the grasshoppers&#x27; favored habitat. Outbreaks of varying severity emerged in 1828, 1838, 1846, and 1855, affecting areas throughout the West. Plagues visited Minnesota in 1856–1857 and again in 1865, and Nebraska suffered repeated infestations between 1856 and 1874.
The last major swarms of Rocky Mountain locust were between 1873 and 1877, when the locust caused $200 million in crop damage in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and other states. One farmer reported that the locusts seemed &quot;like a great, white glistening cloud, for their wings caught the sunshine on them and made them look like a cloud of white vapor&quot; 
while another described the experience as &quot;a big snowstorm, where the air was filled with enormous-size flakes.” The locusts ate not only the grass and valuable crops, but also leather, wood, sheep&#x27;s wool, and—in extreme cases—even clothes off peoples&#x27; backs. Trains were sometimes brought to a halt after skidding over large numbers of locusts run over on the rails. As the swarms worsened, farmers attempted to control them using gunpowder, fires (sometimes dug in trenches to burn as many of the locusts as possible), smearing them with &quot;hopperdozers&quot;, a type of plow device pulled behind horses that had a shield that knocked jumping locusts into a pan of liquid poison or fuel, even sucking them into vacuum cleaner–like contraptions, but all of these were ultimately ineffective in stopping the hordes. 

Charles Valentine Riley, a Missouri entomologist, came up with a recipe for locusts seasoned with salt and pepper and pan-fried in butter. The recipe sold, but some stated that they &quot;would just as soon starve as eat those horrible creatures.&quot; Farmers finally responded in force to the swarm&#x27;s destruction; an 1877 Nebraska law said that anyone between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work at least two days eliminating locusts at hatching time or face a $10 fine. That same year Missouri offered a bounty of $1 a bushel for locusts collected in March, 50 cents a bushel in April, 25 cents in May, and 10 cents in June. Other Great Plains states made similar bounty offers. In the 1880s, farmers had recovered sufficiently from their locust woes to be able to send carloads of corn to flood victims in Ohio. They also switched to such resilient crops as winter wheat, which matured in the early summer, before locusts were able to migrate. These new agricultural practices effectively reduced the threat of locusts and greatly contributed to the species&#x27; downfall.

It has been hypothesized that plowing and irrigation by settlers as well as trampling by cattle and other farm animals near streams and rivers in the Rocky Mountains destroyed their eggs in the areas they permanently lived, which ultimately caused their demise. For example, reports from this era suggest that farmers killed over 150 egg cases per square inch while plowing, harrowing or flooding. It appeared that this species lived and reproduced in the prairie only temporarily during swarming years, with each generation being smaller than the previous one and swarming ever further from the Rocky Mountains, while the permanent breeding grounds of this species seemed to be restricted to an area somewhere between of sandy soils near streams and rivers in the Rockies, which coincided with arable and pastoral lands exploited by settlers.

As locusts are a form of grasshopper that appear when grasshopper populations reach high densities, it was theorized that &quot;M. spretus&quot; might not be extinct, that &quot;solitary phase&quot; individuals of a migratory grasshopper might be able to turn into the Rocky Mountain locust given the right environmental conditions; however, breeding experiments using many grasshopper species in high-density environments failed to invoke the famous insect. The status of &quot;M. spretus&quot; as a distinct species was confirmed by a 2004 DNA analysis of North American species of the genus &quot;Melanoplus&quot;.

&quot;Melanoplus spretus&quot; was formally declared extinct by the IUCN in 2014. It has been suggested that the now critically endangered Eskimo curlew fed on the locust during its spring migration and that its extinction may have added to the pressures on already declining curlew populations including hunting and the conversion of its grassland habitat to agriculture.

==In culture==

Assumption Chapel in Cold Spring, Minnesota, was established as a Christian pilgrimage shrine () () in 1877 by German-American Catholic pioneer farmers, supposedly to keep away future locust plagues similar to those they had faced in both the 1850s and the 1870s. The Feast Day of St. Magnus of Füssen, who is traditionally known in Southern Germany as one of the protectors of farmers from thunderstorms and plagues of vermin, on September 6 was locally celebrated as &quot;Grasshopper Day&quot;. 

The 1877 pilgrimage chapel dedicated to St. Boniface in nearby St. Augusta, Minnesota dates from the same era and was built for exactly the same reason. There is a similar local tradition of pilgrimages to the shrine on June 5th, the Feast Day of St. Boniface, an English Benedictine missionary, Bishop, and martyr instrumental to the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples; and who is still revered as the &quot;Apostle to the Germans&quot;, Patron Saint of the Germanosphere and the German diaspora.

A fictionalized description of the devastation created by Rocky Mountain locusts in the 1870s can be found in the 1937 novel &quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek&quot; by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Her description was based on actual incidents in western Minnesota during the summers of 1874 and 1875 as the locusts destroyed her family&#x27;s wheat crop.

Another vivid portrayal of the depredations of the locust can be found in Ole Edvart Rølvaag&#x27;s &quot;Giants in the Earth&quot;, based in part on his own experiences and those of his wife&#x27;s family.

In 2018, a chamber opera about the Rocky Mountain locust named &quot;Locust: The Opera&quot; premiered in Wyoming, USA. The libretto for the opera was written by professor and author Jeffrey Lockwood who adapted it from his book &quot;Locust: the Devastating Rise and Mysterious Disappearance of the Insect that Shaped the American Frontier.&quot;

<text>Hanya Holm (born Johanna Eckert; 3 March 1893 – 3 November 1992) is known as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; founders of American modern dance. She was a dancer, choreographer, and above all, a dance educator.

==Early life, connection with Mary Wigman==
Born as Johanna Eckert on 3 March 1893 in Worms, Rhineland-Palatinate, German Empire. Holm was drawn to music and drama at an early age, she attended the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt, studying under Emile Jaques-Dalcroze throughout her childhood and young adult life. 

At the age of 28, she saw the German expressionist Mary Wigman perform, and decided to continue her dance career at the Wigman School in Dresden where she soon became a member of the company. Mary Wigman and Hanya Holm shared a special bond through movement. &quot;Egyptian Dance&quot; was said to be the first time Wigman realized the artistic impression Holm was capable of. She had the creative will and ability to shape a choreographic vision into reality. 

Wigman invited Holm to teach, co-direct the Dresden School, and in her recognition of the opportunity that opening a school in New York could offer the world of dance, eventually sent Holm to launch a Wigman branch in New York City (on September 26, 1931). The initial letters of certification and agreement from Wigman to Holm about the migration over to America to direct the school were found in her house after her death in 1992. These letters were published in &quot;Dance, Business, and Politics: Letters from Mary Wigman to Hanya Holm&quot;. In the letters the salary was laid out making sure that the transfer would continue to support her son, Klaus, who stayed in Germany, and the letter of agreement signed by both parties &quot;promises to apply all her strength to the advancement of the New York Wigman School and to conduct the work according to Mary Wigman&#x27;s ideas ... as well as to see that the M.W. philosophy of dance is implemented faithfully within and outside the New York Wigman School in every possible way&quot;.

== Hanya Holm Studio and Hanya Holm Dance Company ==
Holm was not only capable of rising to the challenge of representing the Wigman name and teaching philosophy, she also helped to shape the school and build an influence of her own. Due to the rise of Nazism and a need to distance the school from German ties, it became known as the Hanya Holm Studio (1936–1967). 

Additionally she formed the Hanya Holm Dance Company in 1936, former dancers of the company included Keith Coppage, Carolyn Durand, Marva Jaffay, Mimi Kagan, Louise Kloepper, Henrietta Greenhood (later known as Eve Gentry), Ruth Ledoux, Lydia Tarnower, Bernice Van Gelder, Elizabeth Waters, Oliver Kosock, Gretchen Phillips, and Lucretia Wilson.

Holm&#x27;s first United States performance was &quot;Trend&quot; (1937).

==Technique and choreography==
Holm had a unique form of technique that shaped generations of dancers and choreographers including Alwin Nikolais, Mary Anthony, Valerie Bettis, Don Redlich, Maxine Munt, Alfred Brooks, Liz Aggiss and Glen Tetley. Her technique stressed the importance of pulse, planes, floor patterns, aerial design, direction, and spatial dimensions. Holm&#x27;s movement emphasized the freedom and flowing quality of the torso and back, but remained based on universal principles of physics for motion. Holm trained through improvisation so, a specific movement vocabulary or phrasing that could be carried on through classes does not exist; instead her focus was about learning through discovery. Choreographically her movement focused on the body&#x27;s relation to space and emotion, which was an extension of Wigman and Rudolf Laban. She worked on movement that projected into space. Holm&#x27;s stylistic idea was about &quot;absolute dance&quot; without pantomime or dramatic overtones. Attention to conveying an idea in her choreography was more important than the dancers&#x27; technical ability. Holm would say, &quot;I want to see a sign of passion. I want to see the raw if struggling to express itself. A work must have blood.&quot;

Invited by dance director Martha Hill, Holm was one of the founding artists at Bennington College in 1934 along with Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, and Doris Humphrey, who came to be some of the most influential modern dancers of their time: &quot;The Big Four&quot;. The American Dance Festival (ADF) arose from Bennington College. This was an opportunity for modern dancers to come together to take class and present new works. Holm&#x27;s first major work, &quot;Trend&quot;, (1937) dealt with social criticism and incorporated Ausdruckstanz and American techniques. In 1941, she started a Center of Dance in Colorado Springs where she had summer courses and was able to perfect her creative exploration technique.

In 1948, she choreographed for Broadway: &quot;Ballet Ballads&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; which led to twelve other musicals. Holm&#x27;s dance work &quot;Metropolitan Daily&quot; was the first modern dance composition to be televised on NBC, and her Labanotation score for &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1948) was the first choreography to be copyrighted in the United States. She also choreographed &quot;Out of This World&quot; (1950), &quot;The Liar&quot; (1950), &quot;My Darlin&#x27; Aida&quot; (1952), &quot;The Golden Apple&quot; (1954), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956), &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960), and &quot;Anya&quot; (1965). She also directed a 1960s television musical adaptation of Pinocchio. Holm choreographed extensively in the fields of concert dance and musical theatre. Other works by Holm include: &quot;Tragic Exodus&quot;, &quot;They Too Are Exiles&quot;, &quot;Dance Of Work and Play&quot; and &quot;Dance Sonata&quot;

==As a dance educator==
Hanya Holm&#x27;s approach to teaching was to liberate each individual to define a technical style of his or her own that should express their inner personality and give freedom to explore. She would tell her students, &quot;You have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.&quot; Holm&#x27;s philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer&#x27;s body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. It was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm&#x27;s choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. 

She taught at Colorado College, Mills College, University of Wisconsin, Alwin Nikolais School, and was the Head of Dance Department in New York&#x27;s Musical Theatre Academy. After 1974, she taught at the Juilliard School (Martha Hill, director) in New York. In 1988, a documentary of her life &quot;Hanya: Portrait of a Pioneer&quot; narrated by Julie Andrews and Alfred Drake, and featuring interviews with Holm, Nikolais, Murray Louis, and others, was released by Dance Horizons.

==Family and death==

Her son was Broadway lighting designer Klaus Holm. She and her son are interred in Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. She was divorced from Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a German sculptor.

Holm has been honored by the National Dance Association, in 1976, with the Heritage Award for her contributions to dance education. She was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1988.

Holm died at the age of 99 of pneumonia on 3 November 1992 in New York City, New York.

<text>Mary Wigman (born Karoline Sophie Marie Wiegmann; 13 November 1886 – 18 September 1973) was a German dancer and choreographer, notable as the pioneer of expressionist dance, dance therapy, and movement training without pointe shoes. She is considered one of the most important figures in the history of modern dance. She became one of the most iconic figures of Weimar German culture and her work was hailed for bringing the deepest of existential experiences to the stage.

==Early life==

Karoline Sophie Marie Wiegmann was born in Hanover, Province of Hanover in the Kingdom of Prussia. Wiegmann was the daughter of a bicycle dealer. Already as a child, she was called Mary, &quot;because the Hanoverians were once kings of England and the House of Welf pride never quite got over the decline of the Kingdom of Hanover to a Prussian province.

===Development of expressionist dance, early career===
Wigman spent her youth in Hanover, England, the Netherlands and Lausanne. Wigman came to dance comparatively late after seeing three students of Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, who aimed to approach music through movement using three equally important elements: solfège, improvisation and his own system of movements—Dalcroze eurhythmics. Wigman studied rhythmic gymnastics in Hellerau from 1910 to 1911 with Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and Suzanne Perrottet, but felt artistically dissatisfied there: Like Suzanne Perrottet, Mary Wigman was also looking for movements independent of music and independent physical expression. After that, she stayed in Rome and Berlin. Another key early experience was a solo concert by Grete Wiesenthal. 
The Jaques-Dalcroze school&#x27;s practice made dance secondary to music, so Wigman decided to take her interests elsewhere. In 1913, on advice from the German-Danish expressionist painter Emil Nolde, she entered the Rudolf von Laban School for Art (&quot;Schule für Kunst&quot;) on Monte Verità in the Swiss canton of Ticino. Laban was significantly involved in the development of modern expressive dance (Labanotation). She enrolled in one of Laban&#x27;s summer courses and was instructed in his technique. Following their lead, she worked on a technique based on contrasts of movement; expansion and contraction, pulling and pushing. She continued with the Laban school through the Swiss summer sessions and the Munich winter sessions until 1919.

In Munich, Wigman showed her first public dances &quot;Hexentanz I&quot;, &quot;Lento&quot; and &quot;Ein Elfentanz&quot;. During the First World War she stayed in Switzerland with Laban as his assistant and taught in Zürich and Ascona. In 1917, Wigman offered three different programs in Zürich, including &quot;Der Tänzer unserer lieben Frau&quot;, &quot;Das Opfer&quot;, &quot;Tempeltanz&quot;, &quot;Götzendienst&quot; and four Hungarian dances according to Johannes Brahms. In 1918, Wigman suffered a nervous breakdown. Wigman performed this program again in Zürich in 1919 and later in Germany. Only the performances in Hamburg and Dresden brought her the big breakthrough.

===Weimar Republic period===

In 1920, Wigman was offered the post of ballet mistress at the Saxon State Opera in Dresden, but, after taking up residence in a hotel in Dresden and beginning to teach dance classes while awaiting her anticipated appointment, she learned that the position had been awarded to someone else. In the same year, Wigman together with her assistant Bertha Trümpy, opened a school for modern dance on &quot;Bautzner Strasse&quot; in Dresden. During Wigman&#x27;s time in Dresden, Wigman had contacts with the city&#x27;s lively art scene, for example with the German expressionist painter Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Rivalry and competition between Wigman&#x27;s new school and the old schools of dance in Dresden would emerge, later especially with former students and teachers of the Palucca School of Dance. From 1921, the first performances took place with Wigman&#x27;s dance group. Film recordings of the dance group made in 1923 in the Berlin Botanical Garden with excerpts from &quot;Szenen aus einem Tanzdrama&quot; were used in the 1925 German cultural silent film &quot;Ways to Strength and Beauty&quot; (&quot;Wege zu Kraft und Schönheit&quot;). For a long time, the school on &quot;Bautzner Strasse&quot; in Dresden was a rehearsal stage for the Saxon State Opera in Dresden. When the school moved under the name &quot;Semper Zwei&quot; next to the opera house, the state capital of Dresden bought the property and in 2019 gave it to the association Villa Wigman for Dance (&quot;Villa Wigman für Tanz e. V.&quot;), which uses it as a rehearsal and performance centre for the independent dance scene. 

Wigman&#x27;s most famous male student was Harald Kreutzberg, but there was also Ernest Berk who worked in the UK from 1934 until the mid-1980s. Famous students included Gret Palucca, Hanya Holm, Yvonne Georgi, Margherita Wallmann, Lotte Goslar, Birgit Åkesson, Sonia Revid, and Hanna Berger. Dore Hoyer, who further developed the expressive dance of Wigman and Palucca, worked together with Wigman on several occasions but was never her student. Student Irena Linn taught Wigman&#x27;s ideas in the United States at Boston Conservatory and in Tennessee. Ursula Cain was also one of Wigman&#x27;s students.

On tour, Wigman travelled throughout Germany and neighbouring countries with her chamber dance group. In 1928, Wigman performed for the first time in London and in 1930 in the United States. In the 1920s, Wigman was the idol of a movement that wanted dance free of being subordinate to music. Wigman rarely danced to music not composed for her. It was often only danced to the accompaniment of gongs or drums and in rare cases without any music at all, which was particularly popular in intellectual circles.

===Selected works choreographed and dance school success===
Wigman ceaselessly created and choreographed new solo dances, including &quot;Tänze der Nacht&quot;, &quot;Der Spuk&quot;, &quot;Vision&quot; (all 1920), &quot;Tanzrhythmen I and II&quot;, &quot;Tänze des Schweigens&quot; (all 1920–23), &quot;Die abendlichen Tänze&quot; (1924), &quot;Visionen&quot; (1925), &quot;Helle Schwingungen&quot; (1927), &quot;Schwingende Landschaft&quot; (1929) and &quot;Das Opfer&quot; (1931). Group dances were titled &quot;Die Feier I&quot; (1921), &quot;Die sieben Tänze des Lebens&quot; (1921), &quot;Szenen aus einem Tanzdrama&quot; (1923/24), &quot;Raumgesänge&quot; (1926), &quot;Die Feier II&quot; (1927/28) and &quot;Der Weg&quot; (1932).

In 1930, Wigman worked at the Munich Dancers&#x27; Congress as a choreographer and dancer in the choir work &quot;Das Totenmal&quot; created by in honour of the dead of World War I. By 1927, Wigman had 360 students in Dresden alone, and more than 1,200 students were taught at branches operated by former students in Berlin, Frankfurt, Chemnitz, Riesa, Hamburg, Leipzig, Erfurt, Magdeburg, Munich, and Freiburg, including from 1931 one in New York City by former student Hanya Holm. The engineer and Siemens manager helped Wigman part-time with the administration of this large organization and also became her life partner between 1930 and 1941. Wigman has been photographed dancing and in portraits by many well-known photographers, including Hugo Erfurth, , Albert Renger-Patzsch and Siegfried Enkelmann. The commemorative stamp of the German Federal Post shown here is based on a photo by Albert Renger-Patzsch. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner created the painting &quot;Totentanz der Mary Wigman&quot; (Mary Wigman&#x27;s Dance of Death) in the mid-1920s.

===United States tour===
Wigman toured the United States in 1930 with her dance company, and again in 1931 and 1933. A Wigman school was founded by her disciples in New York City in 1931 and her work through dance and movement contributed as a gateway for social change with the New Dance Group in the 1930s, this group was started by students from Wigman&#x27;s New York school. Wigman&#x27;s work in the United States is credited to her protegee Hanya Holm, and then to Holm&#x27;s students Alwin Nikolais and Joan Woodbury. Another student and protegee of Wigman, Margret Dietz, taught in America from 1953 to 1972. During this time, Wigman&#x27;s style was characterized by critics as &quot;tense, introspective, and sombre,&quot; yet there was always an element of &quot;radiance found even in her darkest compositions.&quot;

==Dance under National Socialism==

The seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933 had an immediate effect on Wigman&#x27;s school through the new law against racial overcrowding in German schools and universities of 25 April 1933 (&quot;&quot;). Wigman initially obtained an exemption by allowing her &quot;5% pupils of non-Aryan descent&quot; for the course from September 1933. However, in the course of the following years, a number of Wigman&#x27;s students were forced to emigrate, such as the Jewish Berlin prima ballerina Ruth Abramovitsch Sorel and member of Wigman&#x27;s dance company Pola Nirenska, whom Wigman had organized to perform at a school audition in 1935 and teacher for a summer course, whereupon Wigman was accused of &quot;friendliness toward Jews&quot; in 1935 and 1937. The Wigman school became a member of the Militant League for German Culture (&quot;Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur&quot;) in 1933. Wigman took over the local group leadership of the &quot;Department of gymnastics and dance&quot; (&quot;Fachschaft Gymnastik und Tanz&quot;) in the National Socialist Teachers League in 1933–1934, but noted for example &quot;Local group meeting – sickening!&quot; in her diary. With &quot;Schicksalslied&quot; (1935) and &quot;Herbstliche Tänze&quot; (1937) further solo dances were created.

The Nazi press had criticized some of the 1934 dances by Wigman and other choreographers, for being insufficiently or unimpressively German, the 1935 &quot;Rogge&quot; and &quot;Wernicke&quot; works were lauded as appropriate examples of &quot;heroic&quot; German bodily movement, but Goebbels apparently disliked &quot;Amazonen&quot; for being too Greek in its iconography. In 1936 Wigman choreographed the &quot;Totenklage&quot; with a group of 80 dancers for the Olympic Youth Festival to mark the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

In 1942, Wigman sold her school in Dresden. She received a guest teaching contract at the dance department of the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig, where the concert pianist Heinz K. Urban accompanied her as a répétiteur. In the same year, Wigman appeared for the last time as a solo dancer with &quot;Abschied und Dank&quot; (Farewell and Thanks).

===German dance festivals and Goebbels Nazi propaganda===
Amidst the fall of Weimar Germany to Nazism, Wigman&#x27;s contributions to modern dance existed within the umbrella of Nazism and the rejection of structured dance (ballet) in favour of “freer” movements. Marion Kant writes in “Dance is a Race Question: The Dance politics of the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda” that Wigman&#x27;s dance style became a means through which Nazi ideologies were propagated. Describing Nazi perceptions of art, records of the Propaganda Ministry in the Federal Archives “embody an ideology to which dance became subject,” as Ausdruckstanz, or the new German Dance, arose as a widely accepted art form due to Nazi leaders’ beliefs that dance would benefit the movement. Document 4 in Kant&#x27;s work features a letter from Fritz Böhme to Goebbels, which articulates how the “German artistic dance ... must not be allowed to be neglected as an art form” and must “function... as a constructive and formative force, as the guardian of racial values, and as a shield against the flood of confusing foreign postures alien to the German character and German stance”. Wigman and her colleagues’ modern dance styles were therefore deemed a means by which the German people could be shielded by outside influence and purified. A note from Ministerial Councilor von Keudell to the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda also recognized Wigman&#x27;s school as one of the “four model schools of German art dance”. Ultimately, these records reveal how Wigman&#x27;s work fit into the narrative of Nazism and how the fall of the Weimar Republic allowed for Wigman&#x27;s success, yielding to the acceptance of “free” dance as Nazi propaganda.

Wigman&#x27;s work also contributed to dance as a gateway for fascist community-building. Susan Manning writes in “Modern Dance in the Third Reich, Redux” that “modern dancers conflated and confused their ideal of the Tanzgemeinschaft (‘dance community’) with the fascist ideal of Volksgemeinschaft (‘ethnic community’)”. German dance environments therefore indirectly supported budding Nazi communities. Manning cites another work by Kant, “Death and the Maiden: Mary Wigman in the Weimar Republic,” in which Kant examines many writings by Wigman in the early years of the rise of Nazism in Germany. Here, Wigman seemed to express support for “the conservative and right-wing nationalists... who would bring down the Republic,” which Manning claims was instrumental in “bringing Volkish thought into the mainstream of Weimar politics”. Modern dance therefore became a hallmark of German unification, with Wigman&#x27;s art heading the establishment of Volkish communities through dance. Whether Wigman&#x27;s contributions to Nazism and its rise were intentional or unintentional is a matter of dispute, as Manning recognizes that “Mary Wigman could [have]... opposed Nazi cultural policy, without recognizing that her own belief... reinforced the Nazi position”. Yet, despite Wigman&#x27;s personal attitudes toward the Nazi Party, her work undoubtedly coexisted and even fit within Nazi ideals of Aryan freedom, community, and identity.

==Post-war Germany==
After 1945, Wigman began again with a Leipzig school and in 1947 staged a sensational performance of &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; with her pupils at the Leipzig Opera. In 1949, Wigman settled in West Berlin, where she founded a new expressive dance school, the Mary Wigman Studio.

===Schiller Prize and Order of Merit===
In 1954, Wigman received the Schiller Prize of the City of Mannheim and in 1957 the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1967, she closed her West Berlin studio and devoted herself to lecturing at home and abroad. Mary Wigman died in 1973. Her funerary urn was buried on 14 November of that year in the Wiegmann family grave at the &quot;Ostfriedhof&quot; in Essen, Germany.

==Productions==

Wigman gave her first public performance in Munich in February 1914, performing two of her own dances, including one called &quot;Lento&quot; and the first version of &quot;Hexentanz&quot; (Witch Dance), which later became one of her most important works.

While recovering from her nervous breakdown in 1918, Wigman wrote the choreography for her first group composition, &quot;Die sieben Tänze des Lebens&quot; (The Seven Dances of Life), which premiered several years later, in 1921. After that her career and influence began in earnest.

In 1925, the Italian financier Riccardo Gualino invited Wigman to Turin to perform in his private theatre and in his newly opened &quot;Teatro di Torino&quot;. She had several years&#x27; success on the concert stage.

Wigman&#x27;s dances were often accompanied by world music and non-Western instrumentation, such as fifes and primarily percussion, bells, including the gongs and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China, contrasted with silence. In later years, she used composers&#x27; talents to create music to accompany her choreography, and many choreographers began to use this tactic.

She would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal dance. She did not use typical costumes associated with ballet. The subject matters included in her pieces were heavy, such as the death and desperation that surrounded the war. However, she did not choreograph to represent the happenings of the war; she danced to outwardly convey the feelings that people were experiencing in this hard time.

==Recognition==
Wigman&#x27;s former student Katharine Sehnert still teaches dance technique and improvisation based on the Wigman style. In Dresden, a street in the &quot;Seevorstadt&quot; and near Dresden Hauptbahnhof, which had previously been named after Anton Saefkow, was named after Mary Wigman. Streets were also named after her in the &quot;Vilich-Müldorf&quot; district of Bonn, in the &quot;Bothfeld&quot; district of Hanover and in the &quot;Käfertal&quot; district of Mannheim. In Hanover, a commemorative plaque was attached to Wigman&#x27;s former home at &quot;Schmiedestrasse 18&quot;. In Leipzig, a memorial plaque on the house at &quot;Mozartstrasse 17&quot; commemorates Wigman, who lived and taught there from 1942 until she moved to West Berlin in 1949.

===Mary Wigman Societies and Mary Wigman Foundation===
The first Mary Wigman Society was founded in Berlin in November 1925 as a society of friends of the Mary Wigman Dance Group. Founding members included the theatre director Max von Schillings, Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob, the composer Eugen d&#x27;Albert, the painters Emil Nolde and Conrad Felixmüller, the archaeologist and senior government minister , the journalists and theatre critics Alfred Kerr and , the art historian Fritz Wichert, Wilhelm Worringer and and Privy Councilor Erich Lexer, a surgeon. It only existed for a few years.

The &quot;Mary Wigman Gesellschaft e. V.&quot;, which has been committed to the history and future of modern dance for decades, published the &quot;Tanzdrama&quot; (Dance Drama) magazine and organized a number of symposia, which was converted into a Mary Wigman Foundation (&quot;Mary Wigman Stiftung&quot;) in 2013. This is located at the German Dance Archive Cologne (&quot;Deutsches Tanzarchiv Köln&quot;), which also owns the rights of use for Mary Wigman&#x27;s works.

===Mary Wigman Prize===
Since 1993, the Foundation for the Promotion of the Semperoper has honoured outstanding artists or ensembles who belong or belonged to the Saxon State Opera (&quot;Sächsischen Staatsoper&quot;) with the Mary Wigman Prize. The award is presented annually at a gala – the foundation&#x27;s prizewinners&#x27; concert. The first prize winner in 1993 was . The prize was not awarded from 2006 to 2012.

<text>Robert Rossen (March 16, 1908 – February 18, 1966) was an American screenwriter, film director, and producer whose film career spanned almost three decades.

His 1949 film &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, while Rossen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. He won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture. In 1961, he directed &quot;The Hustler&quot;, which was nominated for nine Oscars and won two.

After directing and writing for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937. From there, he worked as a screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for the effort in World War II. In 1945, he joined a picket line against Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal B. Wallis&#x27;s newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.

Rossen was a member of the American Communist Party from 1937 to about 1947, and believed the Party was &quot;dedicated to social causes of the sort that we as poor Jews from New York were interested in.&quot;

He ended all relations with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether he had ever been a Communist. As a result, he found himself blacklisted by Hollywood studios as well as unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and his blacklisting ended. In order to repair finances he produced his next film, &quot;Mambo&quot;, in Italy in 1954. While &quot;The Hustler&quot; in 1961 was a great success, conflicts on the set of &quot;Lilith&quot; in 1964 so disillusioned him that it was his last film before his death two years later.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Robert Rosen was born on March 16, 1908, and raised on the Lower East Side of New York City. His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants and his father, Philip Rosen, was a house painter. As a youth, he attended New York University, hustled pool and fought some prizefights - the latter two providing crucial background for his two greatest films, &quot;The Hustler&quot; and &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, respectively. He changed his name from &quot;Rosen&quot; to &quot;Rossen&quot; in 1931.

He started his theatrical career as a stage manager and director in stock and off-Broadway productions, mainly in the social and radical theaters that flourished in New York in the early and mid-1930s, as did John Huston, Elia Kazan and Joseph Losey. In 1932 Rossen directed John Wexley&#x27;s &quot;Steel&quot;, about labor agitation, and Richard Maibaum&#x27;s &quot;The Tree&quot;, about a lynching. A year later Rossen directed &quot;Birthright&quot;, in which Maibaum attacked Nazism, which had just triumphed in Germany with the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler in 1933.

In 1935, Rossen wrote and directed his first play, &quot;The Body Beautiful&quot;, a comedy about a naive burlesque dancer. Although the play closed after four performances, Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy was so impressed that he signed Rossen to a personal screenwriting contract.

===Marriage===
In 1936, Rossen married Susan Siegal; the couple had three children: Carol, Stephen and Ellen.

===Work in Hollywood===
For his first credit in Hollywood, in 1937 Rossen co-wrote with Abem Finkel a script based on the prosecution of crime lord Lucky Luciano and eventually titled &quot;Marked Woman&quot;. Although some of Warner Bros. management saw Rossen as an unknown quantity, the result won praise from both Jack L. Warner and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. Rossen&#x27;s first solo script was for &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937), a fictionalized account of the lynching of Leo Frank, featuring Lana Turner in her debut performance. 

&quot;Dust Be My Destiny&quot;, co-written in 1939 by Rossen, is the story of a fugitive from justice who is eventually acquitted with help from an attorney and a journalist, the latter arguing that &quot;a million boys all over the country&quot; were in a similar plight. Warner Bros. then ordered producer Lou Edelman to cut the script, adding that &quot;This is the story of two people – not a group. It is an individual problem – not a national one.&quot; Rossen was one of three writers on the gangster melodrama &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, released in 1939. A remake of the 1932 play and film &quot;Life Begins&quot; was written in 1939 by Rossen and released in 1940 as &quot;A Child Is Born&quot;. The plot recounted the experiences of six expectant mothers, and there was little scope to modify the original.

&quot;The Sea Wolf&quot;, released in 1941, was based on Jack London&#x27;s novel. Although the film had a strong cast and production, Rossen&#x27;s re-draft of the script may be the greatest influence on the film. While the character of Captain Larsen remained both victim and oppressed in a capitalist hierarchy, he became a symbol of fascism. He split the novel&#x27;s idealist hero into an intellectual bosun and a rebellious seaman. Warner Bros. cut many political points during production.

&quot;Blues in the Night&quot;, written by Rossen and two colleagues and released in 1941, shows a group of jazz musicians traveling in the Depression. Their informal methods represent working-class culture rather than the commercialized music of the big bands. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; reviewer thought the soundtrack was &quot;about all the film has to offer&quot;, and Warner was disappointed with the sales.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild set up on December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body&#x27;s chairman until 1944 and advocated the opening of a Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.

In 1945 Rossen joined a picket line against Warner Bros, making an enemy of Jack Warner. Rossen signed a contract with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.&#x27; head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; in 1946 and &quot;Desert Fury&quot; in 1947. In &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set 15 years later and which Rossen wrote. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.

Dick Powell had been a crooner but was making a new career as a dramatic actor. When Columbia Pictures agreed to make &quot;Johnny O&#x27;Clock&quot; for him in 1947, Powell successfully campaigned for Rossen to direct, and this became Rossen&#x27;s debut in directing. As this crime melodrama proved a modest success, Roberts Productions signed Rossen to direct Abraham Polonsky&#x27;s script of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, described by Bob Thomas as &quot;possibly the best prizefight film ever made.&quot; Rossen preferred an ending in which the hero wins a boxing match and then is killed by a gangster, but Polonsky insisted on his own ending, in which the hero escapes into obscurity before the fight. Following the success of &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, Rossen formed his own production company and signed with Columbia Pictures a contract that gave him wide autonomy over every second film that he made at the studio.

&quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949) was based on the novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren, which in turn was based on the career of politician Huey Long. Rossen introduced a new concept, that the defenders of the ordinary people can in turn become the new exploiters. As a requirement for his participation in the film, Rossen had to write to Columbia&#x27;s Harry Cohn saying that he was no longer a Communist Party member. Cohn&#x27;s critiques of the draft of Rossen&#x27;s script included scrapping a framing structure that was difficult for audiences to follow and several improvements in the relationships and motivations of characters. A meeting of the Communist Party in Los Angeles severely criticized the film, and Rossen severed all relations with the Party. &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Broderick Crawford won the award for Best Actor and Mercedes McCambridge was honored as Best Supporting Actress. Rossen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director but lost to Joseph L. Mankiewicz for &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;. Rossen won the Golden Globe for Best Director and the film won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. His next film, &quot;The Brave Bulls&quot;, was directed in 1950 and released in 1951. This was Rossen&#x27;s last work before the studios blacklisted him. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther called this &quot;the best film on bull-fighting yet.&quot;

===Examinations by HUAC===

After the end of World War II in 1945, the spread of Coummunism became the major concern in the United States. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to investigate Communist elements in the media. The Communist victory of China in 1949 and the start of the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-communist concerns present at the time.

During hearings in 1947, Jack Warner included Rossen among the many openly leftist writers whom his studio Warner Bros. had hired as the earliest and most openly anti-Nazi studio in Hollywood. (Warner Bros. had made &quot;Confessions of a Nazi Spy&quot; [1939] and was criticized by the Republicans for their leftist writers at the time.) Warner reportedly accused Rossen of incorporating communist propaganda in scripts and fired him as a result, though some believe he was also unhappy with the writers’ union activities.

Rossen was one of 19 &quot;unfriendly witnesses&quot; subpoenaed in October 1947 by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during the second Red Scare but was one of eight not called to testify. In 1951, Rossen was named as a Communist by several HUAC witnesses and he appeared before HUAC for the first time in June 1951. He exercised his rights under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, taking what came to be known as the &quot;augmented Fifth&quot;. He testified that he was not a member of the Communist Party and that he disagreed with the aims of the party, but when asked to state whether he had ever been a member of the party, Rossen refused to answer. He was placed on the unofficial blacklist by the Hollywood studios, and Columbia broke its production contract with him.

In a widespread practice during HUAC investigations, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen&#x27;s passport. This, and his inability to find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he identified 57 people as Communists. He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: &quot;I don&#x27;t think, after two years of thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation.&quot; Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father&#x27;s decision:

It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn&#x27;t know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn&#x27;t say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, &#x27;I love you and I&#x27;m behind you.&#x27; 

Like Elia Kazan&#x27;s testimony, Rossen&#x27;s HUAC admissions destroyed many lifelong friendships, along with impacting the careers of many of Rossen&#x27;s colleagues. Kazan&#x27;s career flourished and Rossen&#x27;s career also quickly regained the productivity he had enjoyed prior to the blacklist. He produced, directed and co-wrote &quot;The Hustler&quot;, in 1961, and he was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium Academy Awards, sharing the nomination with his co-writer Sidney Carroll.

===Return to filmmaking===
From 1952 to 1953, Rossen wrote &quot;Mambo&quot;, trying to repair his finances after almost two years without work following the 1951 HUAC hearing. He had to produce the film in Italy, and it was premiered in Italy in 1954 and the USA in 1955. Rossen later said &quot;&quot;Mambo&quot; was to be for fun only,&quot; but he &quot;took it seriously, and it didn&#x27;t come off.&quot; Critics dismissed the film. However, in 2001, Dorothea Fischer-Hornung concluded that the film achieved more than Rossen and contemporary critics realized. The female lead resolves her own conflicts by devoting herself to dance. Katherine Dunham&#x27;s choreography highlights this process; and innovative cinematography intensifies the dance scenes.

Rossen hoped &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1956) would be a blockbuster, but the majority of the reviews criticized the film for failing to keep the audience&#x27;s interest. However, the review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;its moments of boredom are rare...an overlong but thoughtful and spectacular entertainment.&quot;

In 1961, Rossen co-wrote, produced and directed &quot;The Hustler&quot;. Drawing upon his own experiences as a pool hustler, he teamed with Sidney Carroll to adapt the novel of the same name for the screen. &quot;The Hustler&quot; was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two. Rossen was nominated as Best Director, and with Carroll for Best Adapted Screenplay, but did not win either award. He was named Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle and shared with Carroll the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama. &quot;The Hustler&quot; was an enormous popular success and is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States, which had been on the decline for decades.

Rossen was already ill when he started on his final film, &quot;Lilith&quot; (1964), and it was poorly received in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film&#x27;s star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, &quot;It isn&#x27;t worth that kind of grief. I won&#x27;t take it any more. I have nothing to say on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I&#x27;ve got &quot;The Hustler&quot; on my record. I&#x27;m content to let that one stand for me.&quot; However, at the time of his death Rossen was planning &quot;Cocoa Beach&quot;, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Leftist writer Brian Neve described as a &quot;symbol of America&#x27;s imperial reach&quot;.

==Death==
Rossen died in New York City at age 57 on February 18, 1966, following a series of illnesses and is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. His grandchild, Daniel Rossen, is the guitarist/vocalist of alternative bands Grizzly Bear and Department of Eagles.

==Reception==
Rossen was one of the directors who developed film gris (French for &quot;grey film&quot;). In his films for Warner Brothers between 1937 and 1944, consistent themes were the conditions of working people, the portrayal of gangsters and racketeers, and opposition to fascism. After &quot;Dust Be My Destiny&quot;, written by Rossen and released in 1939, Frank Nugent, who regularly reviewed for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, complained about Warner Brothers&#x27; long line of melodramas about boys from poor neighborhoods. Unlike filmmakers such as John Ford and Howard Hawks, Rossen was willing to explain his aims as a director: &quot;The element common to many of my films is the desire for success, ambition, which is an important element in American life. It is an important element, and has become increasingly more important in what is known as Western Civilization.&quot; Polonsky commented that &quot;Rossen&#x27;s talent is force applied everywhere without let-up.&quot; Neve acknowledged that social concerns were central in most of Rossen&#x27;s works, but commented that &quot;Lilith&quot; was different from Rossen&#x27;s earlier films as it emphasized mood rather than narrative and examined through pictures and silences the nature of maladjustment and madness.

Farber noted the strong female characters of the 1930s and 1940s, and laments the replacement of them by all-male relationships from the 1950s onward. For the earlier pattern Farber cited Rossen&#x27;s 1946 script &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, which was over melodramatic but portrayed a woman consumed by power, money and success. &quot;Lilith&quot; created one of the few strong women in the 1960s. Rossen generally destroyed the main character.

All of Rossen&#x27;s playscripts were adaptations except &quot;Marked Woman&quot;, &quot;Racket Buster&quot; and &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, based on real events. Before he was blacklisted in 1951, only two of Rossen&#x27;s adaptions were of serious novels, and Rossen&#x27;s early drafts of the script for &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; received serious criticisms within Columbia.

While head of production at Warner, Hal Wallis considered that some of his best films – including &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, &quot;Marked Woman&quot; and &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; – were written by Rossen. Wallis was very pleased with Rossen&#x27;s script in 1946 for &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, which was produced by Wallis own company. However, Rossen turned down Wallis&#x27;s next two films. Both Wallis as producer and Rossen as writer-director wanted to operate as independents, rather than under the control of a studio.

&quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; was one of the later social &quot;message&quot; films as America turned conservative. Thomas Schatz regarded &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; as possibly the best of the genre, as it examined alcoholism, adultery, political corruption and the influence of journalism. In 2001 the United States National Film Registry preserved the film as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Rossen produced, directed and co-wrote &quot;The Hustler&quot; in 1961. At the time, &quot;Variety&quot; praised the cast, complained about the &quot;sordid aspects&quot; of the story and felt the film was far too long. &quot;The New Republic&quot; praised the cast and Rossen&#x27;s &quot;sure, economical&quot; direction, but thought the script &quot;strains hard to give an air of menace and criminality.&quot; The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for another seven, was nominated in four of the Golden Globes&#x27; categories, and gained many other awards and nominations.

In 1997. the National Film Registry preserved &quot;The Hustler&quot; as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; In 2002, Roger Ebert described the film as one &quot;where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories&quot; and praised Rossen&#x27;s decision to develop all four main characters, and James Berardinelli listed the film in his All Time Top 100 for similar reasons. Ebert also praised Rossen&#x27;s decision to shoot the film in the &quot;stygian gloom of the billiard parlor&quot; created by black-and-white. Other accolades appeared in the 2000s (decade).

Nina Leibman regarded &quot;Lilith&quot; as the most extreme of the American film industry&#x27;s applications, or rather misapplications, of psychoanalytic concepts, as the patient is already psychotic and has a track record of previous conquests. In &quot;The New Biographical Dictionary of Film&quot;, David Thomson describes &quot;Lilith&quot; as &quot;an oddity, the only one of [Rossen&#x27;s] films that seems passionate, mysterious and truly personal. The other films will look increasingly dated and self-contained, but &quot;Lilith&quot; may grow.&quot;

==Preservation==
The Academy Film Archive preserved several of Robert Rossen&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Hustler&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, and &quot;Lilith&quot;.

<text>John C. Servis (born October 25, 1958, in Charles Town, West Virginia) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse trainer who was relatively unknown until May 2004 when his horse Smarty Jones won the Kentucky Derby. The colt then went on to win the Preakness Stakes further increasing Servis&#x27; reputation. Servis&#x27; Cathryn Sophia won 2016 Kentucky Oaks, winning by 2-3/4 lengths over Land Over Sea.

In 2018, Servis won his first Breeders&#x27; Cup race with Jaywalk in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies.

Servis trains horses primarily out of Parx Casino and Racing in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. 

He was born into a family involved in the Thoroughbred racing industry. As a boy, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father worked as a jockey.

Servis trained his 1,000th winner on May 1, 2007 at Philadelphia Park.
John is also the brother of trainer Jason Servis and brother-in-law to Florida Thoroughbred trainer, Edward Plesa.

<text>Shala (Šala) was a Mesopotamian goddess of weather and grain and the wife of the weather god Adad. It is assumed that she originated in northern Mesopotamia and that her name might have Hurrian origin. She was worshiped especially in Karkar and in Zabban, regarded as cult centers of her husband as well. She is first attested in the Old Babylonian period, but it is possible that an analogous Sumerian goddess, Medimsha, was already the wife of Adad&#x27;s counterpart Ishkur in earlier times.

Both in a number of relatively late Mesopotamian texts and in modern scholarship she is sometimes conflated or confused with Shalash, a Syrian goddess regarded as the spouse of Dagan.

==Name==
It is accepted that Shala&#x27;s name has no plausible Akkadian etymology, and it is possible that it was derived from the Hurrian word &quot;šāla&quot;, daughter. Researchers attributing Hurrian origin to Shala include Gary Beckman and Daniel Schwemer. A theory regarded as less plausible considers it to be a cognate of the Hebrew word &quot;šālah&quot;, &quot;to be carefree&quot; or &quot;to be unconcerned.&quot; Frans Wiggermann proposes that it had its origin in a Semitic language and that it might mean &quot;well-being.&quot;

Sumerian and Akkadian texts spell the name as &quot;dŠa-la&quot;. A variant spelling with a long vowel, &quot;dŠa-a-la&quot;, is also attested. Logographic spellings of the name are very rare, though one text attests dME.DIM.ŠA as a logogram meant to be read as &quot;Shala.&quot;

In the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, the alternate names of Shala include Medimsha (Sumerian: &quot;possessing lovely limbs&quot;), Shuzabarku (Sumerian: &quot;she with a shining bronze hand&quot;), Mushmehush, Kinnusum and Enmelulu. Only the first two of these names are attested outside god lists. In one case in a bilingual text Shala appears in the Akkadian version and Shuzabarku in Sumerian. A further name known from bilingual sources is Muhuranki. A &quot;balag&quot; song from the library of Ashurbanipal lists Minunesi and Shubanuna among her names. The same composition also addresses her by the epithet &quot;dumu-é-a&quot;, translated as &quot;child of the house&quot; or &quot;daughter of the house,&quot; which was also applied to the love goddess Nanaya and to Gunura, daughter of the medicine goddess Ninisina. In a late explanatory text, Shuzabarku is defined as &quot;Shala of wisdom,&quot; Medimsha as &quot;Shala of totality,&quot; and Shala under her primary name as &quot;Shala of people and dew.&quot;

==Associations with other deities==
Shala&#x27;s genealogy is unknown. She always appears alongside her husband Adad in known sources, and her character was largely defined by this connection. Texts commonly refer to her as his &quot;great wife&quot; or &quot;beloved wife who gladdens the heart.&quot; In a &quot;balag&quot; song from the library of Ashurbanipal, written in first person, Shala/Medimsha (both names are used in the same text in this case) describes herself as the righteous wife of Adad/Ishkur. Shala and Ishkur are the second most commonly invoked divine couple in cylinder seal inscriptions from Sippar after Aya and Shamash. However, no attestations of Shala are known from the third millennium BCE, and it is assumed she most likely originated in the eastern part of Upper Mesopotamia in the Old Babylonian period. Further west, in Halab (modern Aleppo) and presumably the middle Euphrates area, the wife of the weather god, Hadad, was instead the goddess Hebat. Hebat was also incorporated into Hurrian religion as the wife of his counterpart Teshub. She is absent from later Aramaic sources from the same areas, where the wife of the weather god is also Shala like in Mesopotamia.

Medimsha, treated as an alternate name of Shala in later periods, was initially a different goddess, who appears already in sources from the Fara period though they don&#x27;t provide any information about her role. Daniel Schwemer suggests that it is not unlikely that she was already viewed as the wife of Ishkur and lack of direct evidence for such a relation between them, known from later god lists, is the result of preservation bias. He additionally proposes that some depictions of a naked rain goddess on cylinder seals might be Medimsha. It has also been proposed that some of such images might represent the Hurrian goddess Shaushka, typically regarded as the sister of Teshub in known sources postdating the pairing of the Hurrian weather god with Syrian Hebat and never labeled as his spouse, though the earlier nature of their relationship is impossible to discern.

The daughters of Shala and Adad were Shubanuna, Namashmash (or Nabarbar; reading of the name is uncertain) and Minunesi. While there is presently no evidence for them ever existing as independent deities outside god lists, according to Frans Wiggermann it is possible that they were depicted in a fashion similar to their mother and shared her functions. In art groups of three Shala-like naked goddesses which he argues can be identified with them tend to be accompanied by a sheep-like mythical creature, most likely of astral character, whose name is presently unknown. The etymology of Namashmash and Minunesi is not known, while Shubanuna&#x27;s name means &quot;the princely &quot;šuba&quot;&quot;, &quot;šuba&quot; being a type of unidentified precious stone or shell associated with deities such as Ishtar and Shamash. In one &quot;balag&quot; song Menunesi and Shubanuna are epithets of Shala rather than her daughters. Namashmash and Shubanuna are also attested in a god list in what is assumed to be an enumeration of epithets of Ishtar or Ishara. Shubanuna might also be attested in the name of a month from the local calendar of Adab from the third millennium BCE. This assumption remains uncertain as she is otherwise absent from the city, while a deified &quot;šuba&quot; stone (&quot;dŠuba&quot;) is present in theophoric names from between the Sargonic and Ur III periods, and therefore it would not be impossible for it to also be invoked in a month name.

Further children attested in the sections of god lists dedicated to Shala and Adad include Misharu (&quot;justice;&quot; he could be accompanied by his spouse Išartu, &quot;righteousness&quot;) and Uṣur-amāssu (&quot;heed his word&quot;). While Uṣur-amāssu is regarded as a male deity in god lists, there is evidence for the worship of a goddess bearing the same name in Uruk in the first millennium BCE, and in at least one case she is referred to as &quot;bukrat Adad&quot;, &quot;daughter of Adad.&quot;

A further deity belonging to the court of Adad and Shala in god lists was Nimgir (&quot;lightning&quot;), the sukkal of Adad/Ishkur.

It is possible that on at least one seal Shala and Adad are accompanied by Aya, possibly acting as a divine representative of Sippar.

===Shala and Shalash===

In modern scholarship, Shala is sometimes confused with Shalash, a similarly named Syrian goddess who was the wife of Dagan. According to Daniel Schwemer, while a degree of confusion between the two goddesses is also present in some ancient sources, it is largely limited to scholarly Mesopotamian texts, and no older than the fourteenth century BCE. According to Lluis Feliu, most evidence for it comes from the first millennium BCE.

In some copies of the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Shalash is listed as one of the alternate names of Shala. In an explanatory text Ninkusi, glossed as &quot;Shalash,&quot; is addressed as &quot;Shala of the western steppe.&quot; Ninkusi (&quot;lady of gold&quot;) is recognized as a synonym of Shalash, rather than Shala, in &quot;An = Anum&quot;, where the name appears in the section dedicated to Dagan and his spouse rather than to Adad and Shala. The same god list equates Shalash separately with Ninlil, to match the equation between her husband and Enlil. Additionally, two names are only attested in relation to Shalash, not Shala: Ninudishara (&quot;Mistress who amazes the world&quot;) and Ninsuhzagina (&quot;Mistress diadem of lapis lazuli&quot;).

In a single copy of a &quot;Maqlû&quot; ritual from Assur, Shala occurs in place of Shalash, present in other known copies of the same text.

Lluis Felieu rejects the possibility that the two goddesses were originally the same, and especially that the confusion between them was caused by Dagan being a weather god himself and thus analogous to Adad. He also notes that Shala is well attested in art as a goddess associated with the weather, while the character of Shalash, based on parallels with the wives of heads of other pantheons of the ancient Near East (for example Ninlil, wife of Enlil and Athirat, wife of El), would be unlikely to resemble that of the wife of the Mesopotamian weather god. Additionally, the spelling of the name of the goddess paired with Adad in devotional inscriptions is consistent between various time periods and languages, and never ends with a sibilant. Unlike Shala Shalash is also unlikely to have Hurrian origin, as she is attested in the Ebla texts, which predate the arrival of Hurrians in Syria.

There is very little evidence for confusion of the two goddesses in Hurrian and Hittite sources. Daniel Schwemer considers a treaty of king Shattiwaza to be one example. Lluis Felieu proposes that for Hurrians and Hittites the source of confusion might have been the fact the final -&quot;š&quot; in the name of Shalash name could be interpreted as a case ending in their languages, but he also remarks that the only possible instances might represent scribal mistakes. This reasoning is also accepted by Daniel Schwemer.

Less commonly modern authors also confuse Shala with Shuwala, a Hurrian underworld goddess.

== Iconography and functions==
Similar to spouses of other deities, Shala was believed to intercede on behalf of human supplicants with her husband.

Like her husband, Shala was a weather deity. She was commonly depicted spreading her dress or naked. Texts frequently highlight her charm and beauty. In art she often holds symbols associated with rain, such as lightning bolts. Sometimes she stands on the back of a bull or lion-dragon chimera pulling her husband&#x27;s chariot. Such images are known from both Syria and Mesopotamia.

Shala was also a goddess of agricultural produce. Grain was metaphorically regarded as the product of a sexual union between her and Adad, and some artwork depicts romantic scenes between them alongside humans ploughing their fields. An ear of corn was a symbol of her, especially on kudurru. A star associated with her, Šer&#x27;u (&quot;Furrow&quot;; identified as one of the stars in the constellation Virgo), was depicted as a woman holding an ear of corn in an astronomical tablet from the Seleucid period. Occasionally birds were also associated with Shala in her agricultural role, and on at least one cylinder seal a bird presumably symbolizing Shala accompanies a lightning bolt representing her husband.
Maurits van Loon proposes that a &quot;gate&quot; symbol accompanying Adad and Shala on some seals could represent the rainbow, though he notes his theory does not take into account that in Mesopotamian and Elamite pantheons the rainbow was also represented by a separate goddess, Manzat. He points out that the temple of Shala and Adad at Chogha Zanbil was adjacent to that of Manzat. He considers it a possibility that figures of naked women cupping their breasts found at this site might represent a weather goddess (Shala or Manzat), and their jewelry - the rainbow.

==Worship==
Earliest evidence for the worship of Shala comes from Old Babylonian Nippur, where she appears in offering lists alongside Adad. One of the year names of the Babylonian king Hammurabi indicates that a statue was dedicated to Shala by him. A &quot;qadištum&quot; priestess of Shala is attested in documents from Sippar.

A hymn to Nanaya which enumerates various goddesses regarded as either city goddesses or wives of city gods mentions Shala in association with Karkar, located close to Umma and Adab. Indirect evidence indicates that it was associated with the cult of her husband&#x27;s Sumerian counterpart Ishkur as early as in the Uruk period. According to a list of temples, her sanctuary, most likely located in that city, was the Edurku (&quot;house, pure abode&quot;), which might had been a part of Eugalgal (&quot;house of great storms&quot;), a well attested temple of Adad.

The worship of Shala and Adad as a couple is attested in both Assyria and Babylonia in multiple time periods. Shala appears in late Aramaic sources as well, for example in a bilingual inscription from Tell Fekheriye. In the first millennium BCE Zabban was the location of an important temple of Adad and Shala, seemingly connected in some way with Sippar. She was also venerated in Guzana. An Assyrian temple of Adad and Shala was also located in Kalhu according to a document from the reign of Ashurnasirpal II. An inscription of the neo-Assyrian king Sinsharishkun might indicate that Shala was worshiped in the joint temple of Anu and Adad in Assur. Other sites where she was worshiped alongside Adad include Nineveh, Kurba&#x27;il, Ekallatu, Urakka, Suhu and Babylon. In Achaemenid and Seleucid Uruk Shala was one of the goddesses accompanying Antu during a parade of deities celebrating the New Year festival.

Multiple theophoric names indicating the worship of Shala are known, with Ipqu-Shala, translated as &quot;friendly hug of Shala&quot; by Daniel Schwemer, being particularly common. Other names, with fewer attestations, include Amat-Shala (&quot;servant of Shala&quot;), Apil-Shala (&quot;son of Shala&quot;), Nur-Shala (&quot;light of Shala&quot;), Sha-Shala-rema (&quot;the actions of Shala are merciful&quot;), Shala-damquat (&quot;Shala is good&quot;), Shala-sharrat (&quot;Shala is a queen&quot;), Shala-ummi (&quot;Shala is my mother&quot;), Shimat-Shala (&quot;fate determined by Shala&quot;) and Shu-Shala (&quot;he of Shala&quot;). Some of them are attested west of Mesopotamia, in Mari.

In incantations Shala was invoked against dogs.

=== In Elam ===
Shala was also worshiped in Elam alongside her husband. While names of presumed Elamite weather deities (Kunzibami, Šihhaš and Šennukušu) appear in Mesopotamian god lists, so far none of them were found in Elamite and Akkadian inscriptions from Elam, and it is assumed that Adad (dIM) and his wife were worshiped under their Mesopotamian names and were not merely stand-ins for the names of deities of Elamite origin. They had a joint temple at Chogha Zanbil, referred to with the term &quot;silin&quot;, for which various translations have been proposed (&quot;rain water,&quot; &quot;abundance,&quot; &quot;prosperity,&quot; &quot;growth&quot;). Like a number of other terms used to describe temples forming the Chogha Zanbil complex it is a hapax legomenon. Most of the evidence for worship of the pair comes from the lowlands (especially Susa). Other deities whose worship is known mostly from that part of Elam include Pinikir, Lagamal and Manzat.

Only the so-called Persepolis Fortification Archive from early Achaemenid times undeniably confirms the spread of Adad&#x27;s cult further east. It is also possible that a theophoric name attesting the worship of Shala in the highlands is known from Tall-i Malyān (ancient Anshan).

== Later relevance==
Shala Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after Shala. Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature in the corresponding entry incorrectly identifies her as a &quot;Canaanite&quot; goddess, rather than a Mesopotamian one.

<text>Neubau (; ; &quot;New Building&quot;) is the seventh district of Vienna (). It is located near the center of Vienna and was established as a district in 1850, but borders changed later. Neubau is a heavily populated urban area, with a major shopping area and residential buildings.
It has a population of 32,027 people (as of 2016-01-01) within an area of 1.61 km² (0.62 sq.mi.).

It consists of the former Vorstädte of Neubau, Altlerchenfeld, St. Ulrich, Schottenfeld and Spittelberg. The district borders are formed by Lerchenfelder Straße in the north, Mariahilfer Straße in the south, Neubaugürtel in the west, and Museumstraße and Museumsplatz in the east.
== History ==
In the 18th century, Neubau was the location of the city&#x27;s silk factories. At this time, the area became densely populated. Today, it is an important shopping district, especially in the Mariahilfer Straße and Neubaugasse. Many pubs, popular among the district&#x27;s large student population, are located in the Spittelberg neighborhood. The Volkstheater Wien, one of Vienna&#x27;s large mainstream theatres, and the Austrian Ministry of Justice are located in Neubau, as well as the Museumsquartier, a centre dedicated to modern art, housing for example the Leopold Collection.

In the 2001 communal elections, Neubau became the first district in Austria with a Green Party plurality (32.6% of the votes).

In the 2004 European elections the Green Party received 41% of all votes, which is more than Social Democratic Party and Austrian People&#x27;s Party together.

Like Mariahilf, Neubau is known as one of Vienna&#x27;s districts with the youngest, most liberal, and urban population.

== Politics ==
After the Second World War, the ÖVP had the largest party vote until 1991, when it was displaced by the SPÖ. In 2001, the SPÖ in turn was displaced, this time by the Greens.

At the 2010 elections, the Greens increased their vote, the Liberal Forum vote remained at 1.1%, and the BZÖ increased their vote from their 2005 level of 0.8% to 1.1%.

This district was the first in 2001 and until the 2004 (European Elections 2004) the only district in Austria where the Greens had a relative majority (plurality).

<doc id="705983" wikidata="Q2911594" url="?curid=705983" title="Illicit major">
<text>Illicit major is a formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is undistributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion.

This fallacy has the following argument form:
#&quot;All A are B&quot;
#&quot;No C are A&quot;
#&quot;Therefore, no C are B&quot;

Example:
#&quot;All dogs are mammals&quot;
#&quot;No cats are dogs&quot;
#&quot;Therefore, no cats are mammals&quot;

In this argument, the major term is &quot;mammals&quot;. This is distributed in the conclusion (the last statement) because we are making a claim about a property of &quot;all&quot; mammals: that they are not cats. However, it is not distributed in the major premise (the first statement) where we are only talking about a property of &quot;some&quot; mammals: Only some mammals are dogs.

The error is in assuming that the converse of the first statement (that all mammals are dogs) is also true.

However, an argument in the following form differs from the above, and is valid (Camestres):
#&quot;All A are B&quot;
#&quot;No B are C&quot;
#&quot;Therefore, no C are A&quot;

<doc id="705984" wikidata="Q458852" url="?curid=705984" title="Magnum Force">
<text>Magnum Force is a 1973 American action-thriller film and the second to feature Clint Eastwood as maverick cop Harry Callahan after the 1971 film &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Ted Post, who had previously worked with Eastwood on &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;, directed the film. The screenplay was written by John Milius and Michael Cimino (who later worked with Eastwood on &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;). The film score was composed by Lalo Schifrin. This film features early appearances by David Soul, Tim Matheson, and Robert Urich. At 123 minutes, it is the longest of the five &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films.

== Plot ==
In 1973, after being acquitted of a mass murder on a legal technicality, Carmine Ricca, a mobster and the boss of the Italian-American San Francisco Mafia, drives away from court in his limousine. While traveling on a city road, the driver is pulled over by a San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) motorcycle cop, who calmly guns down all of the occupants in the car. Inspector Harry Callahan visits the crime scene with his new partner, Earlington &quot;Early&quot; Smith, despite the fact that the two are supposed to be on stakeout duty. Their superior, Lieutenant Neil Briggs, seems eager to keep Callahan out of the murder investigation.

While visiting the airport, Callahan helps deal with two men trying to hijack an airplane. He later meets rookie officers Phil Sweet, John Davis, Alan &quot;Red&quot; Astrachan, and Mike Grimes while visiting the police firing range. Sweet is an ex-Army Ranger and Vietnam veteran with great marksmanship skills, and his friends are not that different. Elsewhere, a motorcycle cop shoots up a pool party, leaving no usable evidence of his crime.

As Callahan and Early take down criminals at a drugstore, a pimp murders a prostitute for withholding money from him. The next day, the pimp is killed by a patrolman. While investigating the scene, Callahan realizes that the culprit is a cop. He assumes the culprit to be his old friend Charlie McCoy, who has become despondent and suicidal after leaving his wife. Later, a motorcycle cop murders drug kingpin Lou Guzman. The killer, revealed to be Davis, encounters McCoy in the parking garage and guns him down.

At an annual shooting competition, Callahan learns that Davis was the first officer to arrive after the murders of Guzman and McCoy. He retrieves a slug from Davis&#x27; weapon and has ballistics match it to the bullets from the Guzman murder. Callahan begins to suspect that a secret death squad within the SFPD is responsible for the killings. Briggs insists that Ricca&#x27;s former Mafia associate, Frank Palancio, is the real culprit. Callahan persuades Briggs to assign Davis and Sweet as backup for a raid on Palancio&#x27;s offices. However, Palancio and his gang of mafiosi are tipped off via a phone call, Sweet is killed by a shotgun blast, and all of Palancio&#x27;s men die in the ensuing shootout. Palancio attempts to escape, but Callahan jumps on the hood of his car, causing him to lose control and crash into a crane, killing him.

Briggs angrily suspends Callahan for the death of Sweet. After returning home, Callahan finds Davis, Astrachan, and Grimes waiting for him, presenting him with an ultimatum to side with them; Callahan refuses. While checking his mailbox, Callahan discovers a bomb left by the vigilantes and manages to defuse it. A second bomb, however, kills Early before Callahan can warn him.

Callahan informs Briggs about the bomb and discovers Briggs is the secret leader of the death squad. Briggs defends his actions, claiming that he is only doing what the broken legal system cannot; Callahan responds that he knows the system is flawed, but he has chosen to stand by it until someone comes up with something better. At gunpoint, Briggs orders Callahan to drive to an undisclosed location while being followed by Grimes. Callahan manages to disarm Briggs and force him out of the car before running Grimes over.

Davis and Astrachan appear, causing Callahan to flee onto a derelict aircraft carrier in a shipbreaker&#x27;s yard. Callahan kills Astrachan and takes his motorcycle, leading Davis in a series of jumps between ships. The chase ends with Davis driving off the ship into San Francisco Bay and dying on impact. Callahan is then confronted at gunpoint by Briggs. The lieutenant mocks Callahan and threatens to have him prosecuted. As Callahan backs away from the car, he surreptitiously activates the timer on his mailbox bomb and tosses it in the back seat, which explodes and kills Briggs moments later. Callahan then repeats a comment similar to something he said to Briggs earlier: &quot;A man&#x27;s got to know his limitations.&quot;

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Development ===
Writer John Milius came up with a storyline in which a group of young rogue officers in the SFPD systematically exterminate the city&#x27;s worst criminals, conveying the idea that even worse rogue cops than Dirty Harry exist. Terrence Malick had introduced the concept in an unused draft for the first film; director Don Siegel disliked the idea and had Malick&#x27;s draft thrown out, but Clint Eastwood remembered it for this film. Eastwood specifically wanted to convey that, despite the 1971 film&#x27;s perceived politics, Harry was not a complete vigilante. David Soul, Tim Matheson, Robert Urich, and Kip Niven were cast as the young vigilante cops. Milius was a gun aficionado and political conservative, and the film would extensively feature gun shooting in practice, competition, and on the job. Given this strong theme in the film, the title was soon changed from &quot;Vigilance&quot; to &quot;Magnum Force&quot; in deference to the .44 Magnum that Harry liked to use. Milius thought it was important to remind the audiences of the original film by incorporating the line, &quot;Do ya feel lucky?&quot; repeated in the opening credits.

With Milius committed to filming &quot;Dillinger&quot;, Michael Cimino was later hired to revise the script, overseen by Ted Post, who was to direct. According to Milius, his script did not contain any of the final action sequences (the car chase and climax on the aircraft carriers). His was a &quot;simple script&quot;. The addition of the character Sunny was done at the suggestion of Eastwood, who reportedly received letters from women asking for &quot;a female to hit on Harry&quot; (not the other way around).

Milius later said he did not like the film and wished Don Siegel had directed it, as originally intended:

=== Directing ===
Eastwood himself was initially offered the role of director, but declined. Ted Post, who had previously directed Eastwood in &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;, was hired. Buddy Van Horn was the second unit director. Both Eastwood and Van Horn went on to direct the final two entries in the series, &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; and &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, respectively.

=== Filming ===
Frank Stanley was hired as cinematographer. Filming commenced in late April 1973. During filming, Eastwood encountered numerous disputes with Post over who was calling the shots in directing the film, and Eastwood refused to authorize two important scenes directed by Post in the film because of time and expenses; one of them was at the climax to the film with a long shot of Eastwood on his motorcycle as he confronts the rogue cops. As with many of his films, Eastwood was intent on shooting it as smoothly as possible, often refusing to do retakes over certain scenes. Post later remarked: &quot;A lot of the things he said were based on pure, selfish ignorance, and showed that he was the man who controlled the power. By &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, Clint&#x27;s ego began applying for statehood&quot;. Post remained bitter with Eastwood for many years and claims disagreements over the filming affected his career afterwards. According to second unit director of photography Rexford Metz, &quot;Eastwood would not take the time to perfect a situation. If you&#x27;ve got 70% of a shot worked out, that&#x27;s sufficient for him, because he knows his audience will accept it.&quot;

== Music ==
The orchestra, arranged and conducted by Lalo Schifrin, included:
* Bud Shank — reeds
* Carol Kaye — bass guitar
* Howard Roberts, Dennis Budimir, Tommy Tedesco — guitar
* Max Bennett — double bass
* Emil Richards — percussion

== Controversy ==
The film received negative publicity in 1974 when the scene where the prostitute is killed with drain cleaner was found to have allegedly inspired the Hi-Fi murders, with the two killers believing the method would be as efficient as it was portrayed in the film. The killers said that they were looking for a unique murder method when they stumbled upon the film, and had they not seen the movie, would have chosen a method from another film. The drain cleaner reference was repeated in at least two other films, including &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988) and &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998).
According to John Milius, this drain-cleaner scene was never meant to be filmed, but was only mentioned in his original script.

== Release ==

=== Box office ===
In the film&#x27;s opening week, it grossed $6,871,011 from 401 theatres. In the United States, the film made a total of $44,680,473, making it more successful than the first film and the sixth highest-grossing film of 1973.

Theatrical rentals were $19.4 million in the United States and Canada and $9.5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $28.9 million.

=== Reception ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; critics such as Nora Sayre criticized the conflicting moral themes of the film, and Frank Rich believed it &quot;was the same old stuff&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote: &quot;The problem with &quot;Magnum Force&quot; is that this new side of Harry—his antivigilantism—is never made believable in the context of his continuing tendency to brandish his .44 Magnum revolver as if it were his phallus. The new, &#x27;Clean Harry&#x27; doesn&#x27;t cut it. Some of the film&#x27;s action sequences do.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the film &quot;too preoccupied in celebrating violence to keep it in focus.&quot; Pauline Kael, a harsh critic of Eastwood&#x27;s for many years, mocked his performance as Dirty Harry, commenting, &quot;He isn&#x27;t an actor, so one could hardly call him a bad actor. He&#x27;d have to do something before we could consider him bad at it. And acting isn&#x27;t required of him in &quot;Magnum Force&quot;.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was positive, praising the film as &quot;an ingenious and exciting crime thriller&quot; with &quot;a less self-righteous message&quot; than the original &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Gary Crowdus wrote in &quot;Cinéaste&quot;, &quot;We are left with the comforting assurance that when we need him, Harry (and all the cops like him who do the &#x27;dirty&#x27; jobs no one else wants) will be there protecting us from the lunatic fringes of both Left and Right. Sure, Harry may be a little trigger-happy, but at least he shoots the right people. The problem, however, one which the film raises but never resolves, is who determines the definition of &#x27;right&#x27; people?&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 70% based on 27 reviews, with the critic consensus being: &quot;&quot;Magnum Force&quot; ups the ante for the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise with faster action and thrilling stuntwork.&quot;

<text>Mount Smythe is a mountain in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. 

It is located in the Winston Churchill Range, southwest of Gong Peak and north of Mount Nelson. It reaches a summit elevation of . 

The mountain was named after Francis Sydney Smythe, an international mountaineer who climbed in the Himalayas, Alps and the Canadian Rockies.

==Geology==

<text>Big government is a term that refers to a government or public sector that is considered excessively large or unconstitutionally involved in certain areas of public policy or the private sector.

The term may also be used specifically concerning government policies that attempt to regulate private or personal matters such as private sexual behavior or individual food choices – similar to the British term &#x27;nanny state&#x27;. The term has also been used in the context of the United States to define a dominant federal government that seeks to control the authority of local institutions – an example being the overriding of state authority in favor of federal legislation.

== Definition ==
Big government is primarily defined by its size, measured by the budget or number of employees, either in absolute terms or relative to the national economy.

<text>Odessey and Oracle is the second studio album by the English rock band the Zombies. It was released in the UK on 19April 1968, by CBS Records and in the US on 15July 1968, by Date Records. The album was recorded primarily between June and August 1967 at EMI (now Abbey Road Studios) and Olympic Studios in London.

The Zombies, having been dropped from Decca Records, financed these sessions independently. After signing with CBS, two singles and later the album itself were released to critical and commercial indifference, and the band quietly dissolved. A third single from the album, &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, became a surprise hit in the United States in early 1969 after CBS staff producer Al Kooper recommended it be released on Date Records.

The album gradually achieved critical praise and a cult following, and has since become one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1960s. It was ranked 80th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; revised its list in 2020, the album ranked 243rd.

==Recording and production==

&quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; was recorded after the Zombies signed a recording contract with the UK CBS label. They began work on the album in June 1967. Nine of the twelve songs were recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). &quot;Friends of Mine&quot; was recorded on 1 June, &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; was started on 1 June and completed on 10 July (take 5 reduction of take 3), &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; was recorded on 2 June (take 4) and 15 August (horn overdub), &quot;Hung Up on a Dream&quot; was recorded on 10–11 July (take 7 reduction of take 3), and &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Tale (Western Front 1914)&quot; was recorded on 20 July (take 1). The EMI sessions used the same Studer four track machine used on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

In late July, when EMI was unavailable, the Zombies temporarily shifted base to Olympic Studios where they recorded &quot;Beechwood Park&quot;, &quot;Maybe After He&#x27;s Gone&quot; and &quot;I Want Her, She Wants Me&quot;. They returned to EMI in mid-August to record &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; (take 5 reduction of take 4) and &quot;Brief Candles&quot; (take 10 reduction of take 9) on 16–17 August and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; (14 September, take 1). The sessions ended in November and the final track to be recorded was &quot;Changes&quot; (take 5) on 7 November 1967.

Because the album was recorded to a deadline and tight budget, the Zombies worked quickly in the studio, having rehearsed rigorously beforehand. This meant that there would be no outtakes or unused songs recorded during the sessions. Cello and Mellotron parts were added to &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; but left out at the final mixing stage.

Colin Blunstone and Paul Atkinson felt disillusioned and tempers flared during the recording of &quot;Time of the Season&quot;. Blunstone was not at all keen on the song. When writer Rod Argent insisted that he sing it a certain way, Blunstone&#x27;s patience snapped and he effectively told Argent to sing it himself. Blunstone finally sang the vocal as required.

Argent and Chris White mixed the album down into mono, but when they delivered the master to CBS, they were informed that a stereo mix was required. The recording budget having been spent, Argent and White used their own money to pay for the stereo mix. One major problem arose when it came time to mix &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; into stereo. Record producer Ken Jones had dubbed live horn parts directly onto the mono mix. With the horns not having been recorded on the multi-track beforehand, a &quot;re-channeled&quot; stereo mix had to be made of the mono master of this track. The stereo album mix was completed on 1 January 1968.

Morale within the band was at a low point at the end of the recording. Two singles, &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; and &quot;Friends of Mine&quot;, had been unsuccessful, and the band had a declining demand for live appearances, so after a final gig in mid-December 1967, the band split up.

==Album sleeve==

The album sleeve contains a short text by Argent quoting William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The misspelling of &quot;odyssey&quot; in the title was the result of a mistake by the designer of the LP cover, Terry Quirk (a friend of White&#x27;s). The band tried to cover this up at the time of release by claiming the misspelling was intentional.

==Release history==

&quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; was released in the UK on 19 April 1968. Clive Davis, the head of CBS in the US, initially decided not to release the album. However, the US Columbia label had released the single &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; on 21 November 1967 to complete indifference.

CBS staff producer Al Kooper had picked up a copy of the album during a trip to London, and when he returned to America and played the album he loved it. He believed it contained three hit singles. At the urging of Kooper the US division of CBS was eventually persuaded to release the album on the little known Date Records subsidiary label in June.

Date released &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Tale (Western Front 1914)&quot; as a single in the US, feeling that the song&#x27;s anti-war theme would resonate with record-buyers due to the Vietnam War. The next single, &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; slowly gained popularity before finally hitting big on the US charts in March 1969. After the song became a hit, Date re-released &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; with severely cropped artwork. This time the album charted, reaching number 95 in the US. By then Rod Argent and Chris White were busy with their new band, Argent.

===Other versions===

For the 1997 &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot; box-set, &quot;This Will Be Our Year&quot; was given a full stereo mix, albeit minus the horns. This was made possible because the Zombies owned the multi track masters, which are in the possession of Chris White. Alternate mixes of &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot;, featuring discarded overdubs of cello and Mellotron, appear on &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot; and the 30th anniversary release of the album.

==Reunion performances==

Because the band split before the album was released, they never performed any of the songs onstage. However, due to the surprise success of &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, several &quot;fake&quot; versions of the Zombies were created by unscrupulous promoters in 1969 to cash in on public demand to see and hear the band.

The original five-piece line-up reformed briefly in 1997 for the launch party of the &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot; boxset. They performed &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; at London&#x27;s Jazz Café. In 2001, Blunstone and Argent resurrected the Zombies as a recording and touring unit with ex-Argent and the Kinks bass guitarist Jim Rodford, his son Steve Rodford on drums and Keith Airey on guitar. The Blunstone-Argent lineup toured for several years, performing a number of songs from the album. There was one final reunion of the original five members in 2004 at a benefit gig for Paul Atkinson, and though Atkinson was very ill, he insisted on performing with them. Atkinson died later that year.

In March 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, the four surviving members performed &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; in its entirety for three shows at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. They were joined by Keith Airey, Darian Sahanaja and various friends. The Zombies were insistent on recreating the sound as authentically as possible, hence the extra singers, Sahanaja filling in organ and Mellotron parts via use of a Memotron, and Argent himself playing an original mellotron on a couple of numbers. Argent also tracked down a Victorian pump organ dating from 1896 so they could recreate White&#x27;s &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Tale&quot;, the original organ having long since been given away or sold by White.

The 40th anniversary concerts were sold out and critically acclaimed. One of the shows was recorded, filmed, and released on CD and DVD as &quot;Odessey and Oracle (Revisited)&quot;. The reunion was so successful that they decided to reprise the show on a short four-date British tour in April 2009, playing in Glasgow, Bristol, Manchester, and ending on 25 April at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, which Argent stated would be the very last time the album would be performed on stage, at least until the songs are reverted to public domain. This ended up not being true as the surviving members once again reunited to perform the album in its entirety across America in 2015.

In 2016, the band announced that they would do a final tour to commemorate the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary the following year. They are also planning a coffee-table book about the making of the album.

In 2019, the surviving original members performed the album in its entirety on a string of dates supporting Brian Wilson, including a stop at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles on 12 September and one at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on 26 September 2019.

==Reception==

While the album was received indifferently upon its release, it has since gone on to gain a cult following and become a critically respected album. In their retrospective review, Bruce Eder of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, calling it &quot;one of the flukiest (and best) albums of the 1960s, and one of the most enduring long-players to come out of the entire British psychedelic boom&quot;. BBC Music wrote &quot;To this day it remains a word-of-mouth obscurity. But by those who know it&#x27;s held in such regard that the remaining living members of the band are to perform it in its entirety this year, on the fortieth anniversary of its release.&quot; treblezine.com wrote &quot;&quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, even by today&#x27;s standards, is impossible to top.&quot;

<text>Mushroom Peak is a mountain located in the Sunwapta River valley of Alberta, Canada&#x27;s Jasper National Park, lying just over a kilometre east of Diadem Peak. The mountain was named in 1947 by Noel E. Odell who made the first ascent (solo). Upon reaching the summit, he found that the dark limestone rocks there resembled mushrooms. The mountain can be seen from the Icefields Parkway.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mushroom Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Sunwapta River which is a tributary of the Athabasca River.

==Geology==
Mushroom Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

<doc id="706017" wikidata="Q739622" url="?curid=706017" title="Holden Torana">
<text>The Holden Torana is a mid-sized car that was manufactured by Holden from 1967 to 1980. The name apparently comes from a word meaning &quot;to fly&quot; in an unconfirmed Aboriginal Australian language. The original HB series Torana was released in 1967 and was a four-cylinder compact vehicle closely based on the British Vauxhall Viva HB series of 1966–1970.

Whilst the 1969–1973 (LC and LJ series) cars included more popular, longer-wheelbase six-cylinder versions, and with the 1974–1977 (LH and LX series) cars adding eight-cylinder versions to the mix, a range of four-cylinder versions continued for the entire production life of the Torana (with later four-cylinder versions being marketed as the Holden Sunbird from November 1976).

In South Korea, the LJ Torana was produced locally as the [[Chevrolet]] 1700 (시보레 1700, 1972–1978) and Saehan Camina (새한 카미나, 1976–1978).

Changing tack in Australian motor sport, Holden released the LC Torana GTR XU-1 in 1970, with performance-enhanced drivetrain and handling. From this time through to the release of the Holden Commodore, the Torana remained Holden&#x27;s most successful sports/performance vehicle, with many victories garnered in rallying and circuit racing.

The introduction of the VB Commodore in 1978 was preceded by the arrival of the updated UC Torana/Sunbird twins, but with no sports versions or V8 engine options. The Torana was subsequently discontinued in 1979, followed by the four-cylinder Sunbird in 1980.
== First generation ==

=== HB ===
Introduced in May 1967 to replace the HA series Vauxhall Viva in the Australian market, the first Torana model was a mildly facelifted HB series Vauxhall Viva. It featured a two-door body, 12-inch (305-mm) wheels, and a 56-bhp 1.2-litre four-cylinder engine mated to a four-speed gearbox. A Borg-Warner Model 35 three-speed automatic transmission was optional. Drum brakes were fitted front and rear, with power-assisted front disc brakes optional. In terms of styling, the only points of visual difference between Viva and Torana were in the grille and headlamps, the rear tail panel (no registration plate recess), the deletion of the Viva&#x27;s dashboard air vents, the wheel trims, and the badging—otherwise it was very much a straightforward exercise in badge engineering. Holden&#x27;s HB Torana sedan was retailed in three model specifications: Torana, Torana S, and Torana SL ... these models effectively mirrored the concurrent larger HR Holden sedans with their three-tiered specification of Standard, Special, and Premier.

A &#x27;sports&#x27; option package was released in October 1967, called the &#x27;Brabham&#x27; Torana, named in honour of the well-respected Australian race-car driver, Sir Jack Brabham, who at the time was the reigning F1 World Champion and Australian of the Year for 1966. The Brabham Torana&#x27;s engine featured twin CD Zenith-Stromberg carburettors fitted with individual sports air cleaners. Together with a low-restriction exhaust system, power was boosted to . The Brabham option (available only with manual transmission on Torana S or Torana SL) also included wider wheel rims and red-wall tyres, power-assisted front disc brakes, black body accents, and subtle &#x27;Brabham&#x27; identification badges attached to the leading edges of the front fenders and to the rear boot lid.

In early 1968, a &quot;Series 70&quot; engine option—equivalent to the &#x27;90&#x27; option for the British Vauxhall Viva—was added. This engine had a higher compression ratio and higher-lift camshaft (adapted from the Brabham option engine) and a single CD Zenith-Stromberg carburettor, which boosted output to . Power-assisted front disc brakes were standardised with this engine, whilst availability of the automatic transmission option shifted exclusively to the &quot;Series 70&quot; engine option (no longer available with the standard engine).

In September 1968, the &#x27;69 Torana&#x27; was released, sometimes called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan—some media claimed this design was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva saloon. However, the Vauxpedia website, after extensive research with Vauxhall, maintains that the four-door was designed in England, to compete with Ford&#x27;s four-door Escort, and both Holden and Vauxhall made their own body panels for their respective Torana and Viva versions. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden HK-series. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was the loss of the stalk-operated headlight dip switch and horn. The dip switch ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard engine. The Brabham Torana became an independent model in its own right—(option XS5) based upon the Torana S two-door sedan—complete with bold specific &#x27;Brabham Torana&#x27; badging front and rear and on the flanks, and new black accent body decoration. Its interior specification included a sports steering wheel (from the contemporary Holden HK Monaro GTS) and uniquely comprehensive dash instrumentation with tachometer and three supplementary gauges.

The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.
== Second generation ==

=== LC ===
The next generation of Holden Torana, the LC-series, appeared in October 1969 and was made available with a range of a four-cylinder or six-cylinder engines. The inline six had a capacity of 138 cu in (badged as the &#x27;2250&#x27;); a 161 cu in engine (badged as the &#x27;2600&#x27;) was optional. The six-cylinder cars had a longer wheelbase (100 inches against the of four-cylinder models), a more aggressively styled and longer nose to accommodate the larger engines, and offered a choice of three-speed column shift or four-speed floor shift manual transmissions or the new locally GM-manufactured &#x27;Trimatic&#x27; three-speed automatic transmission with column or floor shift. A bench front seat was available for some column shift models. The LC Torana scored &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award for 1969.

The four-cylinder engine was initially of 1,159 cc, and offered either . The more powerful Brabham Torana engine was not carried over to the LC-series and the model itself was also discontinued. In July 1971, a bigger overhead cam 1.6-litre engine with was added; this engine was also sourced from Vauxhall in the UK. The 1600 OHC engine option also included a strengthened gearbox.

Body styles were based upon the previous HB-series, but the new six-cylinder cars were of a significantly different external appearance. All LC Toranas shared a new body shape rear of the &#x27;B&#x27; pillar, but shared windscreen and front doors carried over from the HB-series (modified with the recessed door handles now required by Australian Design Rules [ADRs]; further to this, all LC four-cylinder cars carried over HB body panels forward of the &#x27;A&#x27; pillar. The LC-series was available in two-door and four-door versions of base (four-cylinder only), S, or SL specification, as well as a two-door sports model called the GTR. The new Torana GTR effectively replaced the previous series&#x27; Brabham Torana, but raised the performance level significantly with its uniquely specified &#x27;2600S&#x27; six-cylinder engine.

As for general features, a three-person front bench seat became available as an option for four-door S and SL six-cylinder models. Later in production (July 1971), the 161-ci engine was replaced with a larger 173-ci version (badged as the &#x27;2850&#x27;) which also made it into the last of the LC GTR cars as the &#x27;2850S&#x27;.

In August 1970, the first ultra-performance Torana, the GTR XU-1, was developed by Holden along with Harry Firth of the Holden Dealer Team for competition in popular Series Production touring car racing within Australia, as well as in off-road rallying and unique rallycross events. However, the highlight purpose of the Torana GTR XU-1 was to keep the Holden brand competitive against the larger and more powerful Ford Falcon GT-HO in the Hardie-Ferodo 500 (Bathurst) endurance race that some consider to be the jewel in the crown of Australian motorsport.

The LC Torana GTR XU-1 was equipped with a , 186-cu in (3-litre) six-cylinder engine, fitted with three Zenith-Stromberg CD-150 carburettors, cast-iron headers, a performance cylinder head and camshaft, and the heavy-duty Australian-designed four-speed manual gearboxes (available in a number of different ratios) replacing the weaker Opel units. This car also featured an underbody front chassis air dam, a rear bobtail spoiler, wider steel wheel rims, and front disc brakes as standard equipment. The Torana GTR XU-1 proved to be a strong performer on both the road and track due to its favourable power/weight ratio. It soon gained popularity in Australian motor sport and successfully replaced the V8 Monaro GTS 350 as Holden&#x27;s frontline track race car in 1970, winning many touring car and rally events, but for the famed Bathurst race which Ford won in 1970 and 1971 with its XW Phase Two and XY Phase Three Falcon GT-HOs, respectively.

Holden built a total of 74,627 LC Toranas.
&#x27;

=== LJ ===
In February 1972, the facelifted LJ Torana was introduced with the six-cylinder models now visually associated with the larger Holden HQ series. Many mechanical components were carried over from the LC-series, with some changes to the choice of engines. The four-cylinder Torana retained its Vauxhall designed 1200OHV and 1600OHC engines, but was now also available with a 1300cc OHV unit. The base two-door car was now simply called the Torana 1200, while the 1300 engine equipped the Torana Deluxe model in either two-door or four-door form. The optional 1600 OHC engine was later in the year to be increased in capacity, badged as the 1760 OHC. Otherwise, the 2250 and 2850 engines carried over into the revised six-cylinder Torana models, and the 3300 engine (known as the 202 in the HQ range) was adopted as the engine for the LJ Torana GTR sedan. Gearbox choices remained the same across the range.

A race-bred version of the 3300 engine was also fitted to the LJ Torana GTR XU-1, producing . By now the XU-1 was equipped with the 202-ci engine and larger CD-175 Zenith-Stromberg triple carburettors, as well as a new close-ratio four-speed Australian-made transmission (which was not available as an option on the standard GTR). Also available on the &#x27;Bathurst Special&#x27; was an even closer-ratio gearbox and the taller (reduced from 3.36:1 to 3.08:1) rear axle final drive ratio from the standard GTR which increased top speed to . This gave the nimble XU-1 the power boost it needed to seriously challenge the powerful Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III, which had won the 1971 Hardie-Ferodo 500 production-car endurance race held annually at Bathurst.

In the somewhat wet 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500, the lightweight HDT Torana GTR XU-1 was able to finally claim victory against the heavyweight GT-HO, driven solo for by Peter Brock. This would be the start of the &#x27;Peter Perfect&#x27;/Torana legend, and the first of five Bathurst wins for the Torana in its colourful 10-year racing career at Bathurst.

The Holden Dealer Team also developed a , 308ci V8-powered version of the GTR XU-1, often erroneously referred to as the GTR XU-2. The V8 Torana did race in Sports Sedan racing in the hands of Brock and Colin Bond, and was extensively road tested by HDT boss Harry Firth and young team engineer/driver Larry Perkins, but the car never made it past the prototype stage. This was due to the &#x27;supercar scare&#x27; of 1972, which involved vast political pressure being placed upon Holden, Ford, and Chrysler to abandon their proposed specially built &#x27;Bathurst Supercars&#x27;, such as the V8 GTR XU-1. This was the result of a media frenzy that was reporting against these soon-to-be released &quot;bullets on wheels&quot; available to the general public. In effect, all three manufacturers (Holden, Ford and Chrysler) bowed to this pressure, and Holden postponed its introduction of a V8 Torana for two years until the release of the larger LH series Torana in 1974.

A total of 81,813 LJ Toranas were built by Holden in Australia, with some exported to New Zealand, but only in six-cylinder form, as the similar 130OHV and 1760OHV four-cylinder Vauxhall Viva HC range was also sold there. The 2850S model, with bucket seats and four-speed floor shift or console shift Trimatic three-speed automatic, was also shipped to New Zealand in CKD kit form for local assembly from 1973, becoming the first Kiwi-built Torana.

==== South Korea ====
In South Korea the LJ Torana was built and sold by GM Korea as the Chevrolet 1700 , with the exception of the wagon, from CKD kits supplied directly by Holden Australia between September 1972 and 1976. Unlike the Torana, the 1700 was also available as a five-door station wagon. Powered by a 1698-cc four-cylinder engine used in the Opel Reckord B which GM Korea was also building and selling at the same time. The 1700 sold poorly on the Korean market with only 8105 units produced. The main deterrent to sales was the high government taxes imposed by the government in relation to this class of vehicle - the automobile taxation system of South Korea greatly favours engines of less than 1.5 litres displacement. The car was also perceived to suffer from high fuel consumption, while the suspension was seen as unsuitable for Korean roads.

Due to poor Chevrolet 1700 sales, the car was revised as the Camina in 1976, receiving a new grill and a four headlight upgrade for the wagon, using some parts from other contemporary Opel models (General Motors Korea was sold to Saehan Motors in 1976 after management troubles). However, the Chevrolet version continued to sell alongside it until both models were discontinued in 1978. A smaller 1492-cc engine, imported directly from Opel Germany, was fitted to deliver better fuel economy than its Hyundai and Kia competitors, but sales did not recover with only 992 cars sold in two years. The 1.5-liter engine offered , enough for a top speed of for the sedan. The station wagon, which retained the 1700 engine, was now called the Saehan Caravan (새한 캬라반); 966 of these were sold from January 1976 until March 1979. An ambulance version arrived in April 1976. The 1700 and Camina replacement, the 1977 Saehan Gemini, was a rebadged Isuzu Gemini fitted with the Opel 1492 engine (the Australian version of the Isuzu Gemini which was sold as the Holden Gemini).
&#x27;

=== TA ===
In 1974, the six-cylinder LJ Torana was replaced by the new mid-sized body six- and eight-cylinder LH Torana series. To fill the gap before the March 1975 release of the four-cylinder GM world T-car Holden Gemini, the short-wheelbase four-cylinder (1.3- and 1.8-litre) LJ models were given a basic facelift incorporating a body-colour plastic-moulded front grille assembly and revamped rear light lenses. This car was released in February 1974 on the Australian market only, in both two- and four-door forms, as the TA Torana. It was only produced for 11 months with a total production run of 11,304 units.

== Third generation ==

=== LH ===
March 1974 had the first completely new Torana body, with the arrival of the larger mid-sized LH series, produced in four-door sedan style only. Despite the larger external size, the car was relatively cramped by mid-1970s standards. It resembled other GM products of its generation, notably the Opel Rekord D and particularly in overall size and profile, the closely related FE series Vauxhall Victor. It was unique in that, following the addition of a four-cylinder option in May 1974, the same body style was available with a choice of inline-four, inline-six, or V8 engines, specifically, 1.9-litre Opel four, 2.85- and 3.3-litre Holden &#x27;red&#x27; sixes, and 4.2- and 5.0-litre Holden V8s. Low-compression versions of the fours and sixes were also available for export markets.

Exports to the Philippines also occurred, where it was sold as the &quot;Holden 1900&quot;.

The 5.0-litre engine was reserved for the sporting LH Torana SL/R 5000 sedan. A special build derivative of the SL/R 5000 was the Bathurst-intended &#x27;L34 Option&#x27;, of which only 263 were built, with a higher-compression engine with stouter components for more power and durability in competition use. The most notable external feature of the L34 was the bolt-on wheel arch extensions, designed to accommodate the larger racing rims and tyres.

The L34 option, which was first seen in 1975, proved to be fast and successful, yet fragile, in Australian touring car racing. It was eventually superseded by the evolutionary A9X option made available in the LX Torana series in 1977. The A9X was delivered with a standard 5.0, but used the L34 motor in races which was developed by Repco for the LH SL/R 5000 H.O. L34. The A9X version of the Torana had a larger 10-bolt Salisbury differential with disc brakes and had the option of the Borg Warner Super T10 four-speed. Hardly any cars were delivered with Super T10 option, so in effect the immortalized A9X was a pretty stock car with a better differential and suspension. The LH Torana in L34 form won the Bathurst 1000 touring car race with Peter Brock and Brian Sampson in 1975 and with Bob Morris and John Fitzpatrick in 1976, with the L34 motor being fitted to the A9X, so in effect winning with that car, as well.

According to Holden Dealer Team boss Harry Firth, Holden chose to have the V8 engine in the SL/R 5000 developed by Repco on their dyno which led to massive oil surge problems on the race track and had a number of teams, including the HDT, suffer numerous engine failures in both testing and races in 1974. Firth believed that using the same V8 engine he had developed for the stillborn V8 GTR XU-1 would have solved this problem, as the HDT had already cured the oil problems, but Holden ignored his warnings.

Prototype wagon and hatchback versions of the LH Torana were built, but never reached production. Overall, a total of 70,184 LH Toranas were built. A few special models of the LH were built, the somewhat sporting Plus 4 and G-Pak models. The Plus 4 arrived in September 1974 and was an attempt to move a few more of the slow-selling four-cylinder models. The G-Pak, first seen in February 1975, received the 3.3-litre inline-six. Both came with a four-speed manual, sporting instrumentation, and disc brakes in front.

New Zealand assembly got off to a troubled start. General Motors New Zealand, which still had a wide four-cylinder Vauxhall Viva/Magnum line on sale, had planned a 2850 six &#x27;S&#x27; model with bench front seat and three-speed column manual shift and the 3300SL with bucket seats and four-speed manual or three-speed Trimatic floor shift. The New Zealand government, though, imposed a 60% sales tax (a post-first oil crisis measure) on cars with engines over 2.7 litres just as GM launched the LH in mid-&#x27;74, and only a few of each were built. The LH was then withdrawn temporarily and relaunched some months later with the Opel 1.9-litre I4 and floor-shift manual or automatic (SL only) gearboxes. Six-cylinder Toranas would never again be built in New Zealand and were only very rare imports after this. GM New Zealand also built a local version of the Australian Plus 4 &#x27;sports&#x27; special edition, but the changes were only cosmetic - bright paint colours, special wheel trims, black stripes and all-black interior trim.
=== LX ===
The mildly facelifted LX series arrived in February 1976. Cosmetically, the most obvious changes were to replace the LH&#x27;s rectangular headlights with round headlights, side window surrounds were changed from body colour to black, and the front Holden badge was enlarged. A two-door hatchback body was introduced as an alternative to the four-door sedan, although the 1,897-cc Opel unit was not offered in the new body style. Soon after its introduction, in July 1976 the LX was subjected to performance-reducing engine modifications to comply with new ADR27A emission regulations. Power outputs (from now on specified in kilowatts, as part of Australia&#x27;s metrication programme) changed as:
* 173/2.85: from to 
* 202/3.3: from to 
* 253/4.2: from to 
* 308/5.0: from to 

==== LX Sunbird ====
When the LX Torana was introduced, it featured a choice of four-, six-, and eight-cylinder engines. In November 1976 the four-cylinder Torana was revised and relaunched as the Holden LX Sunbird. Reflecting the new emissions rules, power from the Opel-sourced engine was down from . From this point, all four-cylinder models were marketed as Sunbirds and the six- or eight-cylinder models as Toranas. The original LX series Sunbird was a single-trim range, with four-speed manual and three-speed automatic transmissions. There were minor trim differences compared to the Torana, notably the grille (with vertical bars) and distinctive chrome wheel covers. It was marketed as a four-door sedan and as a three-door hatchback, unlike the short-lived four-cylinder LX Torana. The introduction of Sunbird also coincided with the first attempt by Holden to add a handling package to its range of cars. The introduction of &#x27;radial-tuned suspension&#x27; (RTS) began with the LX Sunbird sedan and hatchback and then the LX Torana.

==== A9X option ====
During 1977, the LX series also had the development of another limited-build high-performance option aimed at winning in Australian Touring Car racing, and in particular at the annual Bathurst 1000 touring car race. This &#x27;A9X Option&#x27; was available on the 5.0-litre V8-powered SLR 5000 sedan and SS hatchback models. The A9X visually resembled the L34-optioned LH model, but with the addition of a rear-facing bonnet scoop designed to increase airflow into the engine bay (carburettor) to produce maximum power in motor racing applications. The A9X package varied from the old L34 in road form in that whilst the engine was not modified, the A9X nevertheless had some special mechanical features such as rear disc brakes, heavy-duty axles, and a heavy-duty &#x27;10 bolt&#x27; differential.

After being rushed into Group C touring car racing, Peter Brock gave the A9X a dream debut by winning the 1977 Hang Ten 400 at Sandown. However, after he put his Torana on pole position, the A9X ultimately lost its debut Bathurst race in 1977 to the Ford Falcons of Allan Moffat and Colin Bond. The A9X package was soon refined and proved dominant during the following two seasons of touring-car racing in Australia. Drivers Peter Brock and Bob Morris were victorious in the 1978 and 1979 Australian Touring Car Championships, respectively, and A9Xs shared by Peter Brock and Jim Richards won the 1978 and 1979 Bathurst 1000s. In a show of the A9X&#x27;s superiority, Brock and Richards won the 1979 race by a record six laps, with Brock setting the touring-car lap record on the last lap of the race.

Overall, a total of 65,977 LX Toranas were produced by Holden.

An A9X recently sold at auction for $500,000. In mid 2021 one was expected to fetch over $1,000,000 at auction. 
=== UC ===
The introduction of the UC Torana in March 1978 occasioned the demise of V8 power and the cessation of the sporting SL/R variant in the Torana range of cars. The UC series featured a significantly modernised frontal appearance and a completely new interior dash layout. Torana was now rationalised to a choice of two equipment levels and two six-cylinder engines, the 2.85-litre and the 3.3-litre. A &#x27;Deluxe Pack&#x27; was an option that allowed the UC Torana SL to compete with Ford&#x27;s TE Cortina Ghia, which comprised laminated windscreen, tinted side and rear windows, intermittent wipers, radio/cassette player, cloth trim, sports instrumentation, and bumper overriders. While the V8 was discontinued in the UC, a factory sanctioned dealer option of a turbo was offered. This was called the UC SL/T. These were mainly ordered through Suttons in NSW, but one is known to have been ordered through Zupps in Queensland. These were produced in a mini production run of five cars and only 33 were built. Only one is known to exist today that was ordered through Zupps.


The Holden Sunbird was also updated to UC specifications and continued to sell well as a 1.9-litre four-cylinder car, sharing its body architecture with the UC Torana sedan and hatchback. The UC Sunbird expanded into three trim levels: base (manual only), SL, and SL/E. It did very well in New Zealand, where it was assembled, particularly in fleets, where it competed with the Ford Cortina and a variety of Japanese D-segment models.

The UCs had square headlamps and a smoother front end. LX and early UC Sunbirds were fitted with a 1.9-litre Opel engine. Later UC models had the locally produced 1,892-cc Starfire Four engine that was also installed into the Australian-produced versions of the Toyota Corona and in four-cylinder versions of the Holden Commodore. This sluggish motor was simply a crudely cut-down version of the long-running Holden six-cylinder engine. The hatchbacks were deleted in 1979, leaving only the sedans for the 1980 model year. The last Australian Sunbird was built in September 1980. The Sunbird was replaced initially by a four-cylinder version of the Holden Commodore, before the arrival of its natural, albeit smaller, successor, the Holden Camira, from 1982.

At one point, design consideration was given to a five-door hatchback version of the UC Torana, which had a similar side profile to the Rover SD1 and rode an extended wheelbase. The idea never got past the clay-modelling stage, probably in most part due to the impending introduction of the GM V-Car, the Commodore.

After release of the VB Commodore in November 1978, it soon became clear to GM-H that the Torana was too similar in size when compared to the more modern Holden Commodore. As a result, the UC Torana was soon dropped from the Holden range in 1979. The UC Sunbird continued through 1980 with a new, locally manufactured 1.9-litre Starfire engine (based on the 2.85-litre six) replacing the imported Opel unit.

For a while at least, talk of further extending the Torana/Sunbird&#x27;s production life beyond 1980 occurred, with a facelifted &#x27;UD&#x27; model, of which prototype models of the sedan and hatchback were actually built - featuring frontal styling similar to the Opel Ascona B. However, due to the car itself being outdated when compared to the new Japanese opposition (notably the Chrysler Sigma, Datsun Bluebird, and Mazda 626), Holden decided on an easier route by simply introducing the Starfire engine into the VC-series of Commodore sedans and wagons.

Ultimately, the title of four-cylinder mid-sized Holden was taken over in 1982 by the Camira, Holden&#x27;s version of GM&#x27;s front-wheel drive &#x27;J-Car&#x27;. However, the Starfire engine did remain available for another two years in the VH-series Holden Commodore, and continued to be fitted to the VK-series in New Zealand.

Just over 55,000 UC series Toranas and Sunbirds were produced.

== Torana concept cars ==
=== Torana GTR-X ===
The Torana GTR-X was designed during the era of the LC series, and was seriously considered for production in the early 1970s. The GTR-X had a wedge-shaped fibreglass body featuring a hatchback rear access, and the prototype cars had LC Torana GTR XU-1 mechanical components.

The GTR-X looks similar to iconic sports cars of the 1970s, such as the Maserati Khamsin and the Porsche 924. It weighed and has a top speed of . The Torana GTR-X in production would have been the first Holden car to be factory fitted with four-wheel disc brakes.

When Holden released a promotional brochure about the GTR-X, they said, &quot;Its long, sleek hood is accentuated by a low, wedge-shaped grille. The body line sweeps up at the rear to an elevated tail light assembly. Simplicity is the keynote. It is achieved by concealed headlights, sharp windshield rake, recessed parking and turning lights, and flush petrol filler access and door handles. Front and rear bumpers assume the contour of the body. To identify the car, the GTR-X identification is contained within a crisp black and orange stripe running parallel to the rocker panel&quot;.

The Torana GTR-X was highly developed by Holden from concept, and though brochures, photography and promotional films were produced to show how serious they were in putting the car into production, the company was ultimately unable to justify the high cost of committing itself to production given the size of the Australian population then.

The only existing complete prototype GTR-X car was originally white, but painted silver in the mid &#x27;70s. It had UC Torana SL/E wheels fitted and a few other cosmetic changes (bonnet badge, etc.) made in an attempt by Holden to update the car for the times and &quot;restore it&quot;. During this period, it toured motor museums around Australia. In 2003, the car was returned to its original colour and build condition by Car Shine in Melbourne, prior to being shipped to the General Motors Technical Center in Michigan for their celebration of automotive design spanning 75 years. This car is now on display at the National Motor Museum, Birdwood South Australia.

One other pre-production GTR-X is in the hands of a former long-time Holden employee, along with the body mould jig to make more fibreglass bodies. Whether this car will ever be finished is unknown due to the age of the owner. The picture of this orange car can be seen in Norm Darwin&#x27;s book release of the Torana, but the name and location of the owner is kept secret to prevent possible theft.
=== Torana Mystere ===
In 1977, Recaro built a concept car for the 1977 Sydney Motor Show; the vehicle was based on a Holden Torana LX SS Hatchback. Appearing on the front cover of the October 1977 &quot;Modern Motor&quot; magazine, the concept was put together by the Recaro Australia managing director David Bones and marketing director Robin Luck (a former editor of &quot;Modern Motor&quot;).

The vehicle was designed and built by Arcadipane Automotive (Peter Arcadipane), featuring a &#x27;Monza&#x27; style front end coupled with a rear end that had been shortened by some 355 mm and was powered by a 308-cu in V8 backed up by an M21 four-speed manual transmission. The plan was to release the vehicle once two key issues were ironed out, those being; confirmation of GMH&#x27;s backing for mechanical warranty and getting the cost of the vehicle below $15,000. In addition to the body modifications, the key unique feature of the vehicle was its interior. Recaro commissioned a special tanner in West Germany to produce sufficient hides to upholster all seats in a unique green colour that was to be a feature of the car&#x27;s paintwork. The cost of this full leather interior, however, formed a significant challenge in meeting the $15,000 target price.

Only one Mystere was produced. The vehicle has survived and is owned by an enthusiast in Melbourne.
=== Torana TT36 ===
In 2004, Holden released a luminous, hot pink or &quot;ManGenta&quot; medium-sized, rear-drive concept car called the Torana TT36 (Twin Turbo; 3.6-litre V6). The project was originally named XP54, reflecting the acronym &#x27;eXperimental Project&#x27; and coded 54 in recognition of Holden&#x27;s so-called Studio 54 design workshop in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. The model was said to debut a new platform for General Motors and previewed the look of the 2006 VE Commodore.

By applying twin KO4 Warner turbochargers, an air-to-air intercooler, and variable valve actuation to its Alloytec 190, then dropping the compression to 9.0:1, Holden engineers were able to deliver a power peak of and no less than 480Nm of torque, with 90% available from just 1600 rpm.

The prototype first visited the National Motor Museum at Birdwood in the Adelaide Hills in early 2008 and has returned on several occasions, most recently in September 2019.

<text>Illicit minor is a formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is undistributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion. 

This fallacy has the following argument form:
:All A are B.
:All A are C.
:Therefore, all C are B.

&quot;Example:&quot; 
: All cats are felines. 
: All cats are mammals. 
: Therefore, all mammals are felines.

The minor term here is mammal, which is not distributed in the minor premise &quot;All cats are mammals&quot;, because this premise is only defining a property of possibly some mammals (i.e., that they&#x27;re cats.) However, in the conclusion &quot;All mammals are felines&quot;, mammal &quot;is&quot; distributed (it is talking about all mammals being felines). It is shown to be false by any mammal that is not a feline; for example, a dog. 

&quot;Example:&quot;
: Pie is good.
: Pie is unhealthy.
: Thus, all good things are unhealthy.

<doc id="706019" wikidata="Q6468810" url="?curid=706019" title="Laconophilia">
<text>Laconophilia is love or admiration of Sparta and of the Spartan culture or constitution. The term derives from Laconia, the part of the Peloponnesus where the Spartans lived.

Admirers of the Spartans typically praise their valour and success in war, their &quot;laconic&quot; austerity and self-restraint, their aristocratic and virtuous ways, the stable order of their political life, and their constitution, with its tripartite mixed government. Ancient Laconophilia started to appear as early as the 5th century BC, and even contributed a new verb to (literally: to act like a Laconian). Praise of the Spartan city-state persisted within classical literature ever afterward, and surfaced again during the Renaissance.

The French classicist François Ollier in his 1933 book &quot;Le mirage spartiate&quot; (The Spartan Mirage) warned that a major scholarly problem is that all surviving accounts of Sparta were by non-Spartans who often excessively idealized their subject. The term &quot;Spartan Mirage&quot; has come to refer to &quot;idealized distortions and inventions regarding the character of Spartan society in the works of non-Spartan writers,&quot; beginning in Greek and Roman antiquity and continuing through the medieval and modern eras. These accounts of Sparta are typically associated with the social or political concerns of the writer. No accounts survive by the Spartans themselves, if such were ever written.

==Ancient Laconophilia ==

===Athens===
In ancient Athens, Laconism began as a current of thought and feeling after the Persian Wars. Some, like Cimon, son of Miltiades, believed that Athens should ally with Sparta against the Persian Empire. Cimon persuaded the Athenians to send soldiers to aid Sparta, when the helots (serfs of the Spartans) revolted and fortified Mount Ithome. The Spartans sent the Athenians home again with thanks, lest democratic Athenian ideas influence the helots or the Perioeci.

Some Athenians, especially those who disliked commerce, preferred a closed society and the rule of the few. They believed that the Spartan Constitution was superior to their own. Some even went so far as to imitate Spartan manners by going around Athens long-haired and unwashed, like the Spartiates. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, which is set in the 5th century BC, gives credibility to this claim by having Socrates opine that the Spartan or Cretan type of political regime is the favorite of &quot;the many&quot;.

A group of extreme Laconising oligarchs, known as the Thirty Tyrants, seized power in Athens in 404 BC and held it for eleven months, assisted by a Spartan army. Their rule, however, was quickly overthrown, and democracy was reinstated.

In 371 BC, the Spartans were defeated in the Battle of Leuctra. As a result of that defeat, Sparta&#x27;s allies revolted and the helots of Messenia were freed. Afterwards, the Spartan economy became less able to support professional soldiers, and inequalities between supposedly equal citizens increased. As a result, the reputation of Sparta, either as a military success or as a guide in domestic affairs, diminished substantially.

===Philosophers===

Laconophiles nevertheless remained among the philosophers. Some of the young men who followed Socrates had been Laconophiles. Socrates himself is portrayed as praising the laws of Sparta and Crete. Critias, a companion of Socrates, helped bring about the oligarchic rule of the Thirty Tyrants, who were supported by Sparta. Xenophon, another disciple of Socrates, fought for the Spartans against Athens. Plato also, in his writings, seems to prefer a Spartan-type regime over a democratic one. Aristotle regarded the kind of laws adopted by Crete and Sparta as especially apt to produce virtuous and law-abiding citizens, although he also criticises the Cretans and Spartans themselves as incompetent and corrupt, and built on a culture of war.

Greek philosophy, therefore, inherited a tradition of praising Spartan law. This was only reinforced when Agis IV and Cleomenes III attempted to &quot;restore the ancestral constitution&quot; at Sparta, which no man then living had experienced. This attempt ended with the collapse of the institutions of Lycurgus, and one Nabis established a tyranny in Laconia.

In later centuries, Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, often described Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. These descriptions, of which Plutarch&#x27;s is the most complete, vary in many details. Many scholars have attempted to reconstruct which parts of these utopias the classical Spartans actually practised, which parts Cleomenes, and which later classical authors invented.

It became fashionable for the Romans to visit Lacedaemon and see the rites of Artemis Orthia, as a sort of tourist attraction – the nearest Greece had to offer to gladiatorial games.

=== Contrary views ===
Even in ancient cultures, Laconophilia was a tendency, not an absolute. None of the contemporaries of the Lycurgan Constitution praised Sparta without reservations, except the Spartans themselves. 

Herodotus of Halicarnassus, consistently portrays the Spartans, except when actually facing battle, as rustic, hesitant, uncooperative, corrupt, and naïve. Plato had Socrates argue that a state which really followed the simple life would not need a warrior class; one which was luxurious and aggressive would need a group of philosophers, like Plato himself, to guide and deceive the guardians. Even Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;encomium&quot; of the &quot;Constitution of the Lacedaemonians&quot; is not unalloyed praise.

Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his &quot;Politics&quot;: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan women are luxurious; the magistrates (and especially the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; the wealth of the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources necessary to be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.

Even after the collapse, and idealisation, of Sparta, Polybius wrote, &quot;My object, then, in this digression is to make it manifest by actual facts that, for guarding their own country with absolute safety, and for preserving their own freedom, the legislation of Lycurgus was entirely sufficient; and for those who are content with these objects we must concede that there neither exists nor ever has existed a constitution and civil order preferable to that of Sparta.&quot;

==Modern Laconophilia==
Admiration of Sparta continued in the Renaissance. Niccolò Machiavelli agreed that Sparta was noteworthy for its long and static existence, but nevertheless asserted that, for &quot;virtù&quot; and glory, Rome was much preferable (&quot;Discourses&quot;). The Elizabethan English constitutionalist John Aylmer compared the mixed government of Tudor England with the Spartan republic, commending &quot;Lacedaemonia [meaning Sparta], the noblest and best city governed that ever was&quot; as a model for England. The Swiss-French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&quot;, arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more cultured nature of Athenian life. Samuel Adams expressed a disappointment that the American republic was failing to meet his ideal of a &quot;Christian Sparta&quot;.

Alexander Hamilton mocked the Laconophilia of his era as unrealistic:
We may preach till we are tired of the theme, the necessity of disinterestedness in republics, without making a single proselyte. The virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for his services. We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.

Laconophilia increased in importance during the nineteenth century. Sparta was used as a model of social purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Slavoj Žižek stated that &quot;all modern egalitarian radicals, from Rousseau to the Jacobins...imagined the republican France as a new Sparta&quot;.

=== Early Zionism ===

Early Zionists, and particularly the founders of the Kibbutz movement in Israel, had been influenced by Spartan ideals, and drew on the Spartan model in particular when disparaging the materialistic values they associated with the diaspora communities they had left. Tabenkin, for example, a founding father of the Kibbutz and the Palmach, was greatly influenced by ancient Sparta. He prescribed that &quot;fighters&#x27; education should begin from the nursery&quot;, that children should from kindergarten age be taken to &quot;spend nights in the mountains and valleys&quot;, taught to fight, and educated for war.

===Racial Laconophilia===

====Karl Müller====
A new element was introduced into Laconophilia by Karl Otfried Müller, who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the Dorians, the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. While the Greek Laconophiles like Plutarch had praised the Spartans, they did not extend this admiration to the Dorians as a whole. Plutarch argued that the founder of their constitution, Lycurgus, had inherited corrupt Dorian institutions. Argos, the traditional enemy of Sparta, was also a Dorian state; so were Corinth, Rhodes, and Syracuse, three of the most commercial states in Greece.

In 1824, however, Müller wrote &quot;Die Dorier&quot;, a history of the Dorian race. It has been described as a &quot;thousand-page fantasia&quot;, which portrays the Dorians as a heroic and noble race who expanded into Greece from the north. He used the new disciplines of comparative linguistics and source-criticism to argue that the Dorians represented a distinct ethno-linguistic group whose original culture could be isolated from later influences. He linked the origin of the Dorians to the mythic Myrmidons of the Trojan war, and their leader Achilles.

====Nazi Laconophilia====
Müller&#x27;s emphasis on the northern origins and racial qualities of the Spartans later fed into the development of Nordicism, the theory of the superiority of a North European Master Race. Later German writers regularly portrayed the Spartans as a model for the modern Prussian state, which also emphasised military self-discipline. It was a short step from this to argue that the Prussians and the Spartans were originally of the same race. Frank H. Hankins summarises views of the American Nordicist Madison Grant, writing in 1916:

Sparta is pictured as particularly Nordic on account of the purity of its Dorian stock, while Athens is more of a mixture. Sparta thus exhibited the military efficiency, the thorough organization and the patriotic sacrifice of the individual to the state characteristic of Nordics everywhere and exemplified in modern Prussia, while Athens exhibited the intellectual brilliancy, the instability, the extreme individualism, the tendency to treason and conspiracy so characteristic of populations having a large Mediterranean element.

These arguments were repeated by Nazi race theorists such as Hans F. K. Günther and Alfred Rosenberg. Adolf Hitler particularly praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting &quot;the number allowed to live&quot;. He added that &quot;The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.&quot; The Spartans had created &quot;the first racialist state.&quot;

Following the invasion of the USSR, Hitler insisted that the Slavs should be treated like the helots under the Spartans: &quot;They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything&quot;, and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that &quot;the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots.&quot;

===Contemporary Laconophilia===

Modern Laconophilia has been present in popular culture, particularly with reference to the Battle of Thermopylae, as portrayed in films such as &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot;. It is also evident in the graphic novel &quot;300&quot; and the film derived from it.

In the modern world, the adjective &quot;spartan&quot; is used to imply simplicity, frugality, or avoidance of luxury and comfort. Because of their reputation for physical prowess, the name &quot;Spartans&quot; has been adopted by teams in several sports. Michigan State University adopted &quot;Spartans&quot; as their collegiate team identity in 1925. In addition to the Michigan State Spartans, other teams include the San Jose State Spartans, Norfolk State Spartans, and others. Soccer clubs include Sparta Prague (Czech Republic), Spartans (Scotland), Ħamrun Spartans (Malta), Sparta Rotterdam (Netherlands).

<text>A pillow is a support of the body at rest for comfort, therapy, or decoration. Pillows are used in different variations by many species, including humans. Some types of pillows include throw pillows, body pillows, decorative pillows, and many more. Pillows that aid sleeping are a form of bedding that supports the head and neck. Other types of pillows are designed to support the body when lying down or sitting. There are also pillows that consider human body shape for increased comfort during sleep. Decorative pillows used on beds, couches or chairs are sometimes referred to as cushions.

In contemporary western culture, pillows consist of a plain or patterned fabric envelope (known as a pillowcase) which contains a soft stuffing, typically synthetic and typically standardized in sizes and shape. Pillows have been historically made of a variety of natural materials and many cultures continue to use pillows made from natural materials in the world.

The word &quot;pillow&quot; comes from Middle English &quot;pilwe&quot;, from Old English &quot;pyle&quot; (akin to Old High German &quot;pfuliwi&quot;) and from Latin &quot;pulvinus&quot;. The first known use of the word &quot;pillow&quot; was before the 12th century.

== History ==
Use of pillows evolved in animals well into prehistory, reptiles and mammals use bodies as pillows, either rest their heads on themselves, and one another, to support the head and neck. Use of pillows for comfort is evident in arboreal mammals, particularly members of Panthera and Hominoidea with several species observed selecting specific parts of tree branches for this purpose. Natural resting postures, such as the use of a laterally rotated arm or leg, may be superior to artificially created pillows in the reduction of stiffness and pain in the joints, and allows an animal to stay more alert to danger by keeping both ears open.

Pillow or cushion making is not exclusive to humans. Nest-building primates sometimes create pillow like structures. Tree dwelling orangutans typically use twigs to create them while chimpanzees have been observed making them on the ground from leaves. It has been observed in other ground dwelling mammals as well, for example Asian Elephants in captivity have been observed creating pillows from straw, though the behaviour has not been observed in the wild. Since domestication, many animals have also learned to make use of human-made pillows and cushions.

Sometime between 5 and 23 million years ago tree-dwelling great apes began building sleeping platforms, including wooden pillows, to improve their sleep. According to studies on chimpanzees that sleep up to eight to nine hours a night using specifically selected ironwood pillows, sturdy pillows enabled great apes to escape being hunted by night predators and not fall out of the trees while asleep. It is likely that this was necessitated by the evolution of large, energy-consuming brains. Though it may also have led to longer periods of REM sleep, that in turn increased their cognitive capacity. 

Humans began making beds 227,000 years ago in Africa made from ash and grass. Recent evidence from 185,000 years ago at Misliya Cave shows that Neanderthals did similar. Prior to this discovery, the earliest were believed to be 77,000 years old. Much later humans began switching to use of separate stone and wood to craft pillows for increased comfort. 

=== Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt ===

The earliest recorded use of the modern human device dates back to the civilizations of Mesopotamia around 7,000 BC. During this time, only the wealthy used pillows. The number of pillows symbolized status so the more pillows one owned the more affluence they held. Pillows have long been produced around the world in order to help solve the reoccurring problem of neck, back, and shoulder pain while sleeping. Besides for comfort, the pillow was also used for keeping bugs and insects out of people&#x27;s hair, mouth, nose, and ears while sleeping.

Pillow use has been associated with the mummies and tombs of ancient Egypt during the 11th dynasty, dating to 2055–1985 B.C. Ancient Egyptian pillows were wooden or stone headrests. These pillows were mostly used by placing them under the heads of the deceased because the head of a human was considered to be the essence of life and sacred.

=== Ancient Europe ===
The Romans and Greeks of ancient Europe mastered the creation of the softer type pillow. These pillows were stuffed with reeds, feathers, and straw in order to make them softer and more comfortable. Only upper-class people typically owned these softer pillows; however, all classes of people were allowed to use some type of pillow while sleeping, lying down or sitting in order to give them support. People in ancient Europe started to use pillows when going to church in order to kneel on while praying and to place holy books on. This is a tradition that still lives on today. In addition, the Romans and Greeks used their pillows by placing them under the head of those deceased just like the ancient Egyptians did.

=== Ancient China ===
Chinese pillows were traditionally solid, though sometimes used with a softer fabric over them. Over many Chinese dynasties, pillows were made from a wide range of materials including bamboo, jade, porcelain, wood, and bronze. Ceramic pillows became the most popular. The use of the ceramic pillow first appeared in the Sui dynasty between 581 and 618 while mass production appeared in the Tang dynasty between 618 and 907. The Chinese decorated their pillows by making them different shapes and by painting pictures of animals, humans, and plants on them. One common type of pottery used was Cizhou ware. Chinese ceramic pillows reached their peak in terms of production and use during the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties between the 10th and 14th century, but slowly phased out during the Ming and Qing dynasties between 1368 and 1911 with the emergence of better pillow making materials.

== Construction and parts ==


Pillows consist of a filler material enclosed in a fabric cover or shell. Covers are made of cloth, such as silk, known as the pillow case or pillow slip. Some pillows have a fancier cover called a &quot;sham&quot; which is closed on all sides and usually has a slit in the back through which the pillow is placed. Rectangular standard bed pillow cases usually do not have zippers, but instead, have one side open all the time. Often, a zippered pillow protector is placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector.

Fillers are chosen on the basis of comfort, resilience, thermal properties, cost and also for medical and ethical reasons. The most common synthetic fillers are materials derived from polymer fibers, such as polyester and memory foam. Synthetic fillers in general are inexpensive and in the case of memory foam can retain their form longer. Natural fillers have been used since antiquity. The most common are feathers, down, wool, latex, cotton (particularly in India), and buckwheat. More exotic materials have also been used including straw, wood, or stone. Down is usually the softer filler and offer good insulation, but is more expensive due to its relative scarcity. Down has been known to be plucked from live geese, but there are already cruelty-free certifications for down products. In India, traditional pillows are made with kapok, the fluffy, glossy fruit-fibres of the trees Ceiba pentandra and Bombax ceiba.

== Lifespan, maintenance and waste management ==
The normal lifespan of a typical western pillow is two to four years. Condition of the pillow can be determined by checking for lumps or folding it in order to see if it stays in that shape. Replacement is recommended for sanitary reasons. All types of pillow covers should be laundered periodically since they are the part that is in contact with a person&#x27;s body. Pillows accumulate dust and microbes among the fill, even when washable pillows are washed. Manufacturers recommend tumble-drying for fifteen minutes every week to freshen them up, and for the heat to kill dust mites. Charities in most countries will not accept used pillows due to hygiene regulations. While some animal shelters accept forms of bedding, most reject donation of used pillows due to the mess they can cause.

Recycling of pillows, like most textile and bedding items, is expensive and has poor yield. As such, few are recycled and most end up in landfills. Their light weight means that they make up a low proportion of household waste by mass. Most of the few pillows collected for recycling are sent to India and Pakistan and used as low-cost bedding, or in South East Asia, co-mingled with other textiles to manufacture cheap bedding.

== Types ==
A pillow is designed to provide support and comfort to the body and head. There are three main types of pillows; bed pillows, orthopedic pillows and decorative pillows, with some overlapping of use between these. The appropriate size of a bed pillow depends on the size of the bed. Larger pillows than standard are available for queen- and king-sized beds.

The choice of bed pillow depends to some extent upon sleeping positions: one manufacturer recommends a thinner and softer pillow for sleeping face down, medium support for sleeping on one&#x27;s back, and a thicker and firmer pillow for sleeping on the side.

=== Beds ===

The classic bed pillow shape is usually a square or rectangle. In the US, they are common in these three sizes (in inches): Standard (20×26 inches), Queen (20×30 inches), and King (20×36 inches). In the US, a less common size is Jumbo (20×28 inches), which is larger than the Standard Size but smaller than the Queen Size.

Pillows are generally covered with a removable pillow case, which facilitates laundering. Apart from the color and from the material of which they are made, pillowcases have three contrasting characteristics:

* Size
* Features
* Opening/closing

&quot;Size&quot; conforms to the pillow the case is to contain. They are typically described as:

;Standard
: (square) 
;Square
;Standard
;Queen
;King

&quot;Square&quot; is also called &quot;continental&quot; in the UK. German pillow sizes are 80×80 cm (older) or 40×80 cm (newer). When considered as a subset of bed pillows, Euro pillows finish 26×26 in and older style travel pillows commonly finished 12×16 in.

The main distinguishing feature is whether the pillow case is plain or with a valance around the edge. In the former case this is described as &#x27;plain style&#x27; and in the latter as &#x27;Oxford style&#x27;.
&quot;Oxford ... has a 5cm-10cm valance round all four sides. With a hemstitched or corded decoration around the inner edge of the valance.&quot;

The opening/closure of pillow cases ranges from the straightforward &quot;bag style&quot; common in the United States to the &quot;housewife style&quot; more common in Europe, with a pocket inside the open end to fully contain the pillow.
&quot;Housewife is ... essentially a bag, with a flap in the open end to tuck the pillowcase behind to keep it in...&quot;

Other methods of closure are ties or buttons/buttonholes.

Body pillows are as long as a full adult body, providing support to the head and neck at the top and to the knees and legs lower down. This type of pillow can be especially useful in providing support for those who sleep on their sides and for pregnant women. Size is 40×140 cm. (See also: )

====Bed pillow sizes====
=== Orthopedic ===
Neck pillows support the neck by providing a deep area for the head to rest and a supportive area to keep the neck in alignment with the spine while sleeping. These can also be known as cervical pillows. Cervical pillows help patients to maintain comfortable positioning after therapeutic, orthopedic and surgical measures.

Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position. Their &quot;U&quot; shape fits around the back of the neck and keeps the head from slipping into an uncomfortable and possibly harmful position during sleep. However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forward, creating neck stiffness.

Doughnut pillows are firm pillows shaped like a torus, with a space in the middle to alleviate pressure on the tailbone area while sitting. These pillows are used primarily by individuals who have suffered an injury to the tailbone area, or who suffer pain from hemorrhoids or another ailment of the colon.

Lumbar pillows are designed to support the inward curve of the lower back, filling the space created between the lower back and the back of the chair when in a sitting position. These pillows are generally used to support the lower back while driving or sitting, such as in an office chair. Orthopedic pillows are similar to memory foam pillows.

=== Decorative ===
Decorative pillows serve a dual purpose. They often have fancy cover material which serves to decorate the room where they are found. Since decorative textiles are commonly 54 inches in width, many decorative pillows finish about 17x17 inches. (54/3 = 18, less seam allowance) When used to decorate a fully made up bed, decorative pillows are likely thrown aside at bedtime, since they are not covered with a washable pillow case, thus, while found on the bed, they are primarily there for decoration, hence they fall under this category. These pillows may be custom made, as well as made by freelancers.

Decorative pillows are also found on furnishings in more public parts of the home, such as sofas, chairs and window seats. Here, their common use may overlap both orthopedic and bed pillows. For example, unless a person has some particular medical condition, they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support, as needed, while seated on a sofa. Likewise, for the occasional nap, decorative pillows are handy for supporting the head or neck, even though they may not be covered with a pillow case, as are bed pillows.

There are five common synonyms for decorative pillows which are descriptive of their use in the home. &quot;Accent&quot; pillows emphasize or accent some other part of the home decor. The terms &quot;sofa pillow&quot; and &quot;couch pillow&quot; refer to the place these decorative pillows are likely found. The terms &quot;toss pillow&quot; and &quot;throw pillow&quot; may refer to the way they generally arrive in their places.

Novelty pillows are shaped like humorous objects (a banana, tweety bird, a human leg, a chainsaw, a dill pickle, a former president) and are meant to brighten up and add humor to a room or lounge area.

Tent-flap pillows are placed at the front of a stack of pillows decorating a bed. This pillows have a separate flap of fabric that is attached at the top of the pillow and folds down over the face. The tent flap can be loose or tacked down; if the flap is loose a decorative tassel or bead is usually used to weigh the flap down so it hangs properly.

Floor pillows are another subset of decorative pillows. These pillows often finish 26×26 inches (one half of the width of the textile, less seam allowance).

=== Combination pillow ===

A combination pillow is a pillow which is for those sleepers which are sleeping in a combination of positions and would like to use their pillow to hug or play.

== Culture ==

In many parts of the world, pillows have cultural significance, and references have extended to a wide variety of other uses, forms and activities.

===Comfort pillows===
In some cultures, pillows have forms for hugging. An example is the &quot;Dakimakura&quot;, a kind of &quot;hugging pillow&quot; originating in Japan that have been endowed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic qualities and pop culture references for additional psychological comfort. Other types of hugging pillows are more practical, such as the &quot;Guling&quot;, long hugging pillow originating from Indonesia and the &quot;Abrazador&quot;, a long hugging pillow originating from the Philippines. A &quot;husband pillow&quot; (also known as a boyfriend pillow) is a large, high-backed pillow with two &quot;arms.&quot; It is used to prop the user upright while in bed or on the floor, as for reading or watching television. Because of this common use, a husband pillow is also called a reading pillow.

===Activities===

====Pillow fighting====
A pillow fight is a common game mostly played by young children (but also by teens and adults) in which they engage in mock physical conflict, using pillows as weapons.

Pillow fights are known to occasionally occur during children&#x27;s sleepovers. Since pillows are usually soft, injuries rarely occur. The heft of a pillow can still knock a young person off balance, especially on a soft surface such as a bed, which is a common venue. In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room. Modern pillows tend to be stronger and are often filled with a solid block of artificial filling, so breakage occurs far less frequently.

====Pillow talk====

Pillow talk refers to the relaxed, intimate conversation that often occurs between two sexual partners after sexual activity, usually accompanied by cuddling, caresses, and other physical intimacy. It is associated with honesty, sexual afterglow, and bonding. In the Western world there are many cultural references to pillow talk.

===Chinese rock pillows===
Chinese rock pillows () played an important role in ancient China. Made from jade, they were believed to translate the energy from the stone to the human brain. Originating in the Ming dynasty, this piece of material was trusted to cure headaches or depression, or simply to better the intelligence of those who use it. It was more common among royalty because it was expensive and rare. Families often married off children based on the quality and intricacy of these pillows. Today, rock pillows are still commonly used during the hot summer months in China.

===Pillows for parts of the body===
Cushioning designed for specific parts of the body are sometimes called pillows. An example is eye pillows which are designed to comfort the eyes. Some mousemats feature wrist rests, that while not generally called pillows, are another example.

===Sex pillows===
A sex pillow is a specially-designed and typically firm pillow used to enhance sexual intercourse. An ordinary firm pillow, however, may be used in place of a special one. Some contain a high-density urethane core to balance firm support with softness. In addition to more common pillow shapes, there are wedge-shaped, ramp-shaped, prism-shaped, etc. pillows which lend themselves to various sexual positions, some of which might be difficult or uncomfortable without them. A very common use of a sex pillow is to place it under the receiving partner&#x27;s buttocks or hips before assuming the missionary position; this pivots the pelvis and increases depth of penetration.

===Pillow menu===
A pillow menu is a list of available pillows provided by a hotel to guests, usually free of charge. It allows guests to make an alternative pillow choice. Some common pillow alternatives are memory foam, buckwheat hull, and hypoallergenic. Some hotels offer pillows to treat specific conditions such as headaches or stress.

<text>Judi Evans (also credited as Judi Evans Luciano, born July 12, 1964) is an American actress.

Evans began her career in daytime in 1983 when she was cast as Becki on &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; She shot to fame shortly after when she was cast as Beth Raines on &quot;Guiding Light,&quot; for which she won a Daytime Emmy Award at the age of 19.

In 1986, she left &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and immediately joined the cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis. In 1991, she took over the role of Paulina Cory Carlino on &quot;Another World,&quot; a role she would continue until the show ended in 1999.

She currently recurs as Bonnie Lockhart on &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot;

==Early life==
Judi Jo Evans was born on July 12, 1964, while on the road with her family&#x27;s circus: The Evans Family Circus. By the age of two, she was put to work as the baby clown who greeted patrons arriving to the tent. Her parents were professional trapeze artists and her three older brothers rotated various circus performer roles, including trapeze artists and clowns. Born into a family of entertainers, it&#x27;s no wonder Evans chose a life in the arts.

She earned the role of Beth Raines on Guiding Light at just 18 years old and went on to win her first Daytime Emmy Award for Supporting Actress in a Daytime Drama just shy of her 20th birthday. She has worked consistently in soaps since then, with long runs on &quot;Guiding Light, Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;.

Evans was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 2008 for &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, 24 years after her first nomination and win for her role on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

== Career ==
Judi Evans is a professional &quot;soap-hopper&quot; with multiple, successful appearances on four Daytime Soap Operas.

She began her career, in 1983, on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Beth Raines. In 1986, she moved over to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; to take on the role of Adrienne Johnson-Kiriakis. In 1991, she moved to New York to take over the role of Paulina Cory on &quot;Another World&quot;. After the conclusion of &quot;Another World&quot; in 1999, Evans moved back to Los Angeles to begin recurring again on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, this time taking on double duty as Bonnie Lockhart and Adrienne Johnson-Kiriakis. In 2009, she took on the role of Maeve Stone on &quot;As The World Turns&quot;.

She currently recurs as Bonnie Lockhart-Kiriakis on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; opposite her longtime co-star Wally Kurth.

In addition to her roles in Daytime, Evans has had a very successful television movie career including roles in &quot;Getting Away with Murder: The JonBenet Ramsey Mystery&quot;, &quot;Love Is on the Air&quot;, &quot;I Am Not For Sale: The Fight to End Human Trafficking&quot;, and &quot;Blood Runs Thick.&quot;

She guest-starred on the hit CBS show &quot;The Mentalist&quot; from 2012-2013 and was a series regular on &quot;Venice: The Series&quot; playing the role of Logan. She also guest-starred on &quot;The Bay (online soap opera)&quot; in the role of Katherine Blackwell.

== Personal ==
Evans was born in Montebello, California. In 1993, she married Michael Luciano. They had one son, named Austin Michael Luciano, who died suddenly in late 2019 at age 23.

In 2020, nearly six months after losing her son, Evans contracted COVID-19 while at the hospital recovering from an accidental injury she incurred during horseback riding. Doctors considered amputating both her legs as part of her treatment, but she, luckily, made a full recovery.

A huge animal lover, Evans and her husband own 3 horses, 3 chickens, and 1 parrot.

<doc id="706022" wikidata="Q606996" url="?curid=706022" title="Natas Kaupas">
<text>Natas Kaupas (born March 23, 1969) is an American former professional skateboarder. He grew up in South Santa Monica, California, in the area known as Dogtown, and is of Lithuanian descent. He is often referred to as one of the first true professional street skateboarders.

==Career==
===Early 1980s===
Kaupas began skating during his childhood years. In 1983 Kaupas won a local Santa Monica surfing contest and received a Santa Monica Airlines (SMA) skateboard as a first place prize. SMA was operated out of the back of a surfshop owned by Skip Engblom. Kaupas approached Engblom about becoming a member of his skate team, which did not exist. However, Engblom was impressed with Kaupas&#x27;s skating ability and offered to sponsor him.

Kaupas attended Santa Monica High School in the 1980s.

Kaupas by his own admission remained clueless and uninterested in the mainstream skateboard subculture. He honed his street skateboarding skills by utilizing his surroundings, preferring not to ride ramps or parks. By the mid-1980s, Kaupas had discovered riding walls where he would throw his skateboard up against a wall and ride off it. He then perfected this trick by riding up the side of walls without using his hands. In 1984 &quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot; photographer and skating commentator Craig Stecyk took a photo of Kaupas riding off a wall which featured on the cover of &quot;Thrasher Magazine&#x27;s&quot; September 1984 issue. With this cover photo, Kaupas began to receive more magazine coverage and recognition from professional skaters. Also in 1984, SMA released Kaupas&#x27;s first pro-model skateboard, which infamously featured a panther image drawn by Santa Monica artist Kevin Ancell. At this point, Kaupas was regularly skating with such notables as Mark Gonzales, Julien Stranger and Jim Thiebaud and pioneering what would be known as &#x27;street skating&#x27;. Kaupas and Gonzales innovated many new skateboarding tricks and ideas, the first of which was transferring Rodney Mullen&#x27;s kickflip from freestyle skating to street skating.

===Widespread recognition===
In 1986, demand for SMA skateboards had grown at an increasing rate which they struggled to meet. At 16, Kaupas impressed Engblom when he arranged a manufacturing and distribution arrangement with the much larger company, Santa Cruz Skateboards. It is claimed by some in the skateboarding community that Kaupas pioneered rail slide manoeuvres in the late 1980s while at a Pro-Am skate contest held in Oceanside, California. Kaupas stunned the crowd by attempting a board slide down a handrail. Although his attempt was unsuccessful, skating history was made. This was followed up when Kaupas and Gonzales performed what is considered the first legitimate rail slide and later with 50-50 grinds.

In 1987, Kaupas had his debut role in the Santa Cruz skateboarding video &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;. In the film, Kaupas displayed an ability to ollie which far surpassed anyone else, and his part is considered to have paved the way for the new direction of skateboarding. This role gave Kaupas a sudden jolt of notoriety, however attention was soon turned to the spelling of his first name, as &#x27;Natas&#x27; spelled backwards is &#x27;Satan&#x27;. Kaupas attempted to explain his name as being the masculine version of the Lithuanian female name &#x27;Natalija&#x27;. Despite this however, many schools and shops instituted a ban on any merchandise bearing the name &#x27;Natas&#x27;.

Later in 1987, Kaupas had become such a well-known figure that shoe company Etnies offered him his own pro model shoe, an entirely new concept in the skating world. The marketing and design of the shoe was influenced by Kaupas. He was able to use his artistic talents, which he later incorporated in SMA skateboard designs.

In 1989, Santa Cruz released a follow-up video to &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; entitled &quot;Streets on Fire&quot;, in which Kaupas played a greater role. Kaupas&#x27; stand-out performance in the film was a new trick where he ollied up onto a fire hydrant and performed a 720 degree spin on top of it. The trick would be known as the &#x27;Natas spin&#x27; and has also been adapted to the sport of snowboarding. The &#x27;Natas Spin&#x27; was also incorporated into the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; video game series.

Kaupas along with fellow skater Jim Thiebaud, who was now skating for SMA, began a tour across America driving used Cadillacs. During the tour, the duo discovered many unknown but talented skaters who would later skate for SMA. Upon their return in 1990, skateboarding&#x27;s hype had died with a slowing US economy.

In 2005, Kaupas received the Legend Award at the seventh annual Transworld Skateboarding Awards.

==Other ventures==
In 1991 fellow pro skater Steve Rocco, who founded World Industries skateboards, approached Kaupas about starting his own line of skateboards. Kaupas left SMA and began 101 Skateboards. The company would become an outlet for Kaupas to employ his graphic and artistic talents. By 1992, 101 had become a major brand, however a broken ankle meant Kaupas&#x27; skating career was halted. While convalescing, Kaupas explored his artistic talents more and began to use computer graphics programs. He was soon asked to assist with the first issue of the Big Brother skateboarding magazine, which was also owned by World Industries. As World Industries and 101 Skateboards became more successful, scooping up many well-established pro skaters and new emerging amateurs, Kaupas lost interest. Kaupas received a call from Larry Flynt Publications who were interested in launching a new magazine entitled &quot;Rage&quot; and needed an art director. Kaupas left shortly afterwards however, again losing interest after a change in tone of the magazine.

In 1998 Kaupas along with longtime friend Mark Oblow formed Vita Shoes, which was short lived. Kaupas then found work in design and art with clothing companies Quiksilver and Element Skateboards. Both companies also sponsored him for their skateboarding team. Quiksilver soon promoted Kaupas to the role of graphic director and then vice president of marketing. 
In 2004, Natas started a new board company, Designarium under the manufacturing and distribution of NHS. Natas&#x27; art background led him to focus Designarium on artists rather than pro skaters. He has commissioned artists to interpret his original Santa Monica Airlines Panther graphic into their own vision. Each board is produced in limited edition runs.

<doc id="706027" wikidata="Q13423728" url="?curid=706027" title="Öre">
<text>Öre () is the centesimal subdivision of the Swedish krona. In the Swedish language, the plural of &quot;öre&quot; is either &quot;öre&quot; (indefinite) or &quot;ören&quot; (definitive).

The name &quot;öre&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;aereus/aurum&quot;, meaning gold. The corresponding subdivisions of the Norwegian and Danish krones are called øre.

Öre coins have been withdrawn since 2010, but the unit remains.

== History ==
During the Middle Ages, the öre was a unit of Swedish currency equal to 1/8 of a &quot;mark&quot;, 3 &quot;örtugar&quot; or either 24, 36 or 48 &quot;penningar&quot; (depending on the geographical area in which it was used). It was already a unit of account in the 11th century, but was not minted as a coin until 1522. This öre was withdrawn in 1776, but returned in 1855 as  of the riksdaler. The riksdaler was replaced by the &quot;krona&quot; in 1873 (one riksdaler equalling one krona), but &quot;öre&quot; remained the name of the minor unit.

The last öre coin was withdrawn in 2010, but the centesimal subdivision is still used in non-cash contexts such as bank balances and cashless transactions, while bills to be paid in cash are rounded to the nearest krona.

== Coins ==
=== 1 Fyrk ===
1 Fyrk coin had a value of a part of 1 öre.

From October 1992, the only coin in use in Sweden with a value below 1 kronor was the 50 öre coin. On 18 December 2008, the Swedish Riksbank announced a recommendation to the Swedish government to phase out the final öre coin by 2010. The coin ceased to be minted on 25 March 2009 and ceased to be legal tender after 30 September 2010.

<text>Øre (plural &quot;øre&quot;, , ) is the centesimal subdivision of the Danish and Norwegian krone. The Faroese division is called the &quot;oyra&quot;, but is equal in value to the Danish coin. Before their discontinuation, the corresponding divisions of the Swedish krona and the Icelandic króna were the öre and the eyrir, respectively. The name &quot;øre/öre&quot; derives from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;golden&quot;.

The Norwegian 10-øre coin was deprecated on 23 February 1992 and ceased to be legal tender in 1993. From then on, the only Norwegian coin in use with a value below NOK 1 was the 50-øre coin, which was also deprecated on 1 May 2012. The original value were the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50-øre coins.

The Danish 25 øre coin ceased to be legal tender on 1 October 2008. The only Danish coin currently in use with a value below DKr 1 is the 50 øre.

<text>Brother Records, Inc. (BRI) is an American holding company and record label established in 1966 that owns the intellectual property rights of the Beach Boys, including &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; trademark. It was founded by brothers Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson, and their cousin Mike Love. As of 2011, the corporation was equally owned by four shareholders and directors: Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson.

==Background and formation==

The Beach Boys decided to form their own label, Brother Records, in response to Capitol Records&#x27; lack of support for the band&#x27;s more ambitious album ideas. According to biographer Steven Gaines, Mike Love was &quot;the most receptive&quot; to the proposal, wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work, and supported Brian Wilson&#x27;s decision to employ his newfound &quot;best friend&quot; David Anderle as head of the label, even though it was against band manager Nick Grillo&#x27;s wishes.

Plans for the company began in August 1966. In a press release, Anderle said that Brother Records was to give &quot;entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product&quot;. Anderle later said that the label was for releasing projects that were &quot;special&quot; for Brian, and there was initially no concern over whether the label&#x27;s products would be distributed by Capitol. Another one of the major reasons that Brother Records was formed was so that Wilson could create his own recording studio.

For the company logo, Wilson chose Cyrus E. Dallin&#x27;s 1908 life size bronze statue &quot;Appeal to the Great Spirit&quot; at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. When Carl Wilson was asked in 1975 why the group used this as their logo, he said the Indian was chosen because the Wilson brothers&#x27; grandfather believed that there was a spiritual Indian guide who watched over them from the &quot;other side&quot;. Carl called the logo &quot;The Last Horizon.&quot;

Brother Records&#x27; office took residence at 9000 Sunset Boulevard and Grillo was assigned the role of financial administrator. Singer Danny Hutton was to have been one of the first artists signed to the label. The Beach Boys also established a short-lived film production company, called Home Movies, to create live action film and television properties starring themselves. The company completed only one production, a promotional clip for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.

Wilson started having increasing doubts about the &quot;Smile&quot; project and showing signs of worsening mental health during the latter months of 1966. After he began suspecting that his father may have planted a listening device in his home, he insisted on holding business meetings in his swimming pool. He also suspected that Capitol was withholding payments from the band and instructed Grillo to conduct an audit of the label&#x27;s financial records. Discrepancies were soon found. On February 28, 1967, the band launched a lawsuit against Capitol that sought neglected royalty payments in the amount of $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate their record contract prior to its November 1969 expiry. Following the suit, Wilson announced that the company would issue &quot;Vega-Tables&quot; as the lead single from &quot;Smile&quot;.

Anderle met with many record companies but failed to secure a distributor for Brother Records. Frustrated by Wilson&#x27;s regressive behavior, Anderle ultimately disassociated from the group. The last time Wilson was visited by Anderle to discuss business matters, Wilson refused to leave his bedroom. The Capitol lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, with the Beach Boys receiving the royalties owed in exchange for Brother Records to distribute through Capitol Records. An official announcement of the resolution was made on July 18. 

==Later years==
Al Jardine became a shareholder in 1973.

Following his death in 1983, Dennis Wilson&#x27;s heirs sold his shares back to the band to repay loans.

According to Mike Love in his 2016 memoir, BRI&#x27;s shareholders continued to receive 17.5% of all revenue under the terms of the license.

In February 2021, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson had sold a majority stake in the band&#x27;s intellectual property to Irving Azoff and his new company Iconic Artists Group.

<text>Project Greenlight is an American documentary television series focusing on first-time filmmakers being given the chance to direct a feature film. It was created by Alex Keledjian, developed by Eli Holzman and produced by Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Sean Bailey, and Chris Moore through their production company LivePlanet, along with Miramax Films. &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; first aired on HBO for two seasons (aired 2001–03) before moving to Bravo for season 3 in 2005. The series returned in 2015 for a fourth season airing on HBO. On July 26, 2016, the series was canceled. In May 2021, HBO Max (later Max) picked up the series with an 8-episode order and will be produced by Issa Rae through her production company Hoorae Media. The revival titled Project Greenlight: A New Generation premiered on July 13, 2023.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (2001–02)===
The script contest ran from September 2000 to March 2001. Over 7,000 screenplays were submitted, and Pete Jones was selected as the winner for &quot;Stolen Summer&quot;, which he then filmed on location in his hometown of Chicago during the summer of 2001. The first season of &quot;Project Greenlight&quot;, helmed by show runner and co-executive producer Liz Bronstein, chronicled the selection of Jones&#x27;s script and the filming of the movie, aired on HBO from late 2001 through early 2002. &quot;Stolen Summer&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2002, then went on to a limited theatrical release which brought in just under $140,000.

===Season 2 (2003)===
For its second run, the contest was split into two categories: writing and directing. The winners were chosen on January 18, 2003. Erica Beeney won the writing contest for her script &quot;The Battle of Shaker Heights&quot;, and Kyle Rankin and Efram Potelle won the directing contest. The film stars Shia LaBeouf, Elden Henson, Amy Smart, and William Sadler. The series aired in the summer of 2003, detailing the production of the film in Los Angeles. &quot;The Battle of Shaker Heights&quot; opened in limited theatrical release on August 24, 2003, earning just under $280,000 during its box office run.

===Season 3 (2005)===
Script submission began and ended during February 2004. After two seasons on HBO, the series moved to Bravo and season 3 began airing on March 15, 2005.

The selected screenplay was a horror script titled &quot;Feast&quot; written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton. The director was John Gulager. The film stars Balthazar Getty, Krista Allen, Jason Mewes, and Eric Dane and was produced by Dimension Films and Neo Art &amp; Logic.

The film ran for a special late night showing on September 22 and 23, 2006, almost a year after its premiere. Feast earned just under $690,000 during its box office run. The DVD was released on October 17, 2006, earning an additional $4,687,595. The film spawned two sequels: &quot;Feast II: Sloppy Seconds&quot; and &quot;Feast III: The Happy Finish&quot;.

===Season 4 (2015)===
On April 2, 2015, &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; announced the first annual Greenie award winners.

*Best Comedy: &quot;Heist&quot; – Director: Brianna Lux and Tony Lazzeroni
*Best Drama: &quot;A Room for Aden&quot; – Director: Douglas Yablun
*Best Action: &quot;Stan Lee Parkour&quot; – Director: Tom Grey
*Most Unique: &quot;Listen&quot; – Director: Joshua Ortiz
*Best Horror: &quot;The Table&quot; – Director: Shane Free
*Most &quot;WTF&quot;: &quot;Pink Shorts&quot; – Director: Jeff Huston

In September 2015, &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; became the subject of controversy when an episode aired of Matt Damon disagreeing with producer Effie Brown over the subject of diversity. A later controversy developed over the titling of the season&#x27;s sixth episode as &quot;Hot Ghetto Mess&quot; involving Brown&#x27;s attempt to make sure one of the films did not partake in racial stereotypes, which was to be corrected before airing and replaced with &quot;The Pivot&quot;, but was never resolved before airtime.

&quot;The Leisure Class&quot; debuted on HBO on November 2, 2015.

==Awards and nominations==
==Australia==

===Series 1===
In 2005, &quot;Project Greenlight Australia&quot; was launched with Pay-TV Movie Network in partnership with Screentime producing the show and offering the A$1,000,000 financing to the winning film. The entries were received online with last entries being accepted on February 14. The screenplay selected from the 1200 submissions was &quot;Solo&quot; by Morgan O&#x27;Neill.

===Series 2===
In 2006, comedian and filmmaker Paul McDermott hosted the series. The screenplay selected from the 700 submissions was &quot;The View from Greenhaven&quot; by The MacRae Brothers.

==Notes==
 The episode &quot;The Pivot&quot; was originally titled &quot;Hot Ghetto Mess.&quot; However, the scene contextualizing the title was removed in last-minute editing. The original title was not corrected for television listings before air due to what was described as a &quot;production error&quot; by HBO. Future airings, along with HBO Go/HBO Now use &quot;The Pivot&quot; as the episode&#x27;s title.

<doc id="706049" wikidata="Q1250287" url="?curid=706049" title="Dorothy Chandler Pavilion">
<text>The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is one of the halls in the Los Angeles Music Center, which is one of the largest performing arts centers in the United States. The Music Center&#x27;s other halls include the Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson Theatre, and Walt Disney Concert Hall.

Since the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and Los Angeles Master Chorale have moved to the newly constructed and adjacent Disney Hall which opened in October 2003, the Pavilion is home of the Los Angeles Opera and Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at the Music Center.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences held its annual Academy Awards in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from 1969 to 1987, 1990, 1992 to 1994, 1996, and 1999.

==History==
The Pavilion has 3,156 seats spread over four tiers, with chandeliers, wide curving stairways and rich décor. The auditorium&#x27;s sections are the Orchestra (divided in Premiere Orchestra, Center Orchestra, Main Orchestra and Orchestra Ring), Circle (divided in Grand Circle and Founders Circle), Loge (divided in Front Loge and Rear Loge), as well as Balcony (divided in Front Balcony and Rear Balcony).

Construction started on March 9, 1962, and it was dedicated September 27, 1964. The Pavilion was named for Dorothy Buffum Chandler who noted Albert Greenstein in 1999. The building was designed by architect Welton Becket. The project was an example of his firm&#x27;s approach of total design, in which he managed all aspects including design, construction, fixtures, and interior finishes to achieve a coherent whole. Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons (now Kiewit Corporation) was the builder.

In order to receive approval for construction from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Chandler promised Kenneth Hahn that the building would be open free for the public for one day a year. The result was the &quot;Los Angeles County Holiday Celebration&quot;, a Christmas Eve tradition sponsored by the Board of Supervisors. The program is broadcast on PBS SoCal and an edited version of the prior year&#x27;s show is syndicated to public television stations via PBS.

The opening concert was held on December 6, 1964, with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic with soloist Jascha Heifetz. The program included &quot;Fanfare&quot; by Richard Strauss, &quot;American Festival Overture&quot; by William Schuman, &quot;Roman Festivals&quot; by Ottorino Respighi, and Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto.

The Los Angeles Master Chorale, under Music Director Roger Wagner, was the other founding resident company at the Pavilion. Before creation of the Los Angeles Opera company, the New York City Opera came regularly on tour and performed in the Pavilion. One such tour, in 1967, consisted of two performances of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, one of &quot;La Traviata&quot;, and two of Ginastera&#x27;s &quot;Don Rodrigo&quot;, each with Plácido Domingo singing the main tenor role.

On December 16, 1970, the hall hosted the monumental 12-hour Beethoven Marathon for Beethoven&#x27;s 200th birthday celebration. Admission was $1 and the finale running well past midnight was the 4th movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic conducted by Zubin Mehta.

The hall&#x27;s acoustics were controversial during the period the Los Angeles Philharmonic made the pavilion its home. Problems varied depending on the listening location, with the orchestra sounding too loud in some places and too muffled in others. However, it was lauded for its remarkable sense of intimacy given its 3,000 seats, allowing the orchestra to dramatically project and emote without sounding too bright or brash. Abe Meltzer, chief consulting acoustician, stated in 1986 that the basic issue was that the Pavilion was a multi-purpose room, rather than one tailored to orchestral concerts.

==Annual Holiday Celebration==
Since 1964, a Christmas Eve tradition for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is the annual free Holiday Celebration funded by Los Angeles County. It used to be six hours (from 3 pm to 9 pm) of music and dance by groups from all around Los Angeles county, However, due to financial cuts in the county budgets, the celebration was cut in half to three hours, limiting the performers to no more than two or three musical numbers each. Also, because of the overcrowds, the audience members have to arrive three hours earlier, where they have to wear colored wristbands in order to gain admission. The performances now last from 3PM to 6PM Pacific Time, without any intermissions. The performances are also broadcast on the PBS SoCal public television station with a one-hour version broadcast on PBS since 2002.

== In popular culture ==

The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is featured in the 2008 video game &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot;.

The site was used as the location for an avant-garde perfume ad directed by Spike Jonze.

Nick Hexum, the lead singer of the alt rock band 311, was briefly a waiter at this venue, as referenced in the lyrics of their song &quot;Applied Science&quot;.

<doc id="706054" wikidata="Q453314" url="?curid=706054" title="Al Jardine">
<text>Alan Charles Jardine (born September 3, 1942) is an American musician who co-founded the Beach Boys. He is best known as the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist, background vocalist, and for occasionally singing lead vocals on singles such as number-one hit &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; (1965), &quot;Then I Kissed Her&quot; (1965), &quot;Cottonfields&quot; (1970), and a cover of the Del-Vikings’ &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; (1981). His song &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; was also a UK top 10 hit for the group in 1979. Other Beach Boys songs that feature Jardine on lead include &quot;I Know There&#x27;s an Answer&quot; (1966), “Vegetables&quot; (1967), a cover of Buddy Holly’s “Peggy Sue” (1978), and &quot;From There to Back Again&quot; (2012).

Following the death of fellow band member Carl Wilson in 1998, Jardine left the Beach Boys touring band and has since performed as a solo artist, rejoining the band only for their 50th anniversary tour in 2012. Since 2013, Jardine has toured alongside fellow Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson and his band; Jardine has also made solo appearances, increasing the amount of these especially since 2018. He has released one solo studio album, &quot;A Postcard from California&quot; (2010). Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys in 1988.

==Early life==
Alan Charles Jardine was born at Lima Memorial Hospital in Lima, Ohio, the younger of two children to Virginia and Donald Jardine. Having spent his first years of childhood in Lima, he moved with his family to Rochester, New York, where his father worked for Eastman Kodak and taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His family later moved to San Francisco and then to Hawthorne, California, where he and his older brother Neal spent the remainder of their youth.

At Hawthorne High School, he was a fullback on the football team, soon befriending backup quarterback Brian Wilson. Jardine also watched Brian and brother Carl Wilson singing at a school assembly. After attending Ferris State University during the 1960–61 academic year, Jardine registered as a student at El Camino College in 1961. There, he was reunited with Brian and first presented the idea of forming a band as the two worked through harmony ideas together in the college&#x27;s music room. Jardine&#x27;s primary musical interest was folk and he learned banjo and guitar specifically to play folk music. When the Beach Boys formed at Wilson&#x27;s home, he first tried to push the band toward folk but was overruled in favor of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.

A versatile string instrumentalist, Jardine played stand-up bass on the Beach Boys&#x27; first recording, the song &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; (1961). He fully rejoined the Beach Boys in the summer of 1963 at Brian Wilson&#x27;s request and worked alongside guitarist David Marks with the band until October 1963, when Marks quit the Beach Boys after a disagreement with the band&#x27;s manager, Murry Wilson.

==Career==

===1960s–80s===

Jardine played double bass on the Beach Boys&#x27; first (and only) record for Candix Records, &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;, but quit the band a few months later, in February 1962. A common misconception from this time states that Jardine left to focus on dental school, but he did not apply to dental school until 1964; he then left due to creative differences and his belief that the newly-formed group would not be a commercial success. He returned to the Beach Boys full-time in 1963 following David Marks&#x27; departure.

Jardine first sang lead on &quot;Christmas Day&quot;, on 1964&#x27;s &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; and followed with the Number 1 hit &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;. It was at Jardine&#x27;s suggestion that the Beach Boys recorded a version of the folk standard &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, which Brian Wilson arranged and produced for their &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album in 1966.

After Brian Wilson discontinued touring in late 1964, Jardine took on a more prominent role as a lead vocalist during live performances with the group. Beginning with his contributions to the &quot;Friends&quot; album, Jardine also became a songwriter and wrote or co-wrote a number of songs for the Beach Boys. &quot;California Saga: California&quot; from the Holland album, charted in early 1973. Jardine&#x27;s song for his first wife, &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; (1978), scored a Top Ten chart entry in the UK. Increasingly from the time of the &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; album, Al became involved alongside Carl Wilson in production duties for the Beach Boys. He shared production credits with Ron Altbach on &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; (1978) and was a significant architect (with Mike Love) of the album&#x27;s concept and content. As with &quot;Lady Lynda&quot; and his 1969 rewrite of Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Fields,&quot; &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on &quot;M.I.U. Album&quot; were Jardine productions, the first being a measurable hit in the UK.

Jardine instigated the Beach Boys&#x27; recording of a remake of the Mamas and the Papas&#x27; song &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; (featuring Roger McGuinn), reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart in 1986. The associated music video featured in heavy rotation on MTV and secured extensive international airplay. The video featured all the surviving Beach Boys and two of the three surviving members of the Mamas and the Papas, John Phillips and Michelle Phillips (Denny Doherty was on the East coast and declined), along with former Byrds guitarist Roger McGuinn.

===1990s–2000s===

In 1991, Jardine had allegedly been &quot;suspended&quot; by Love from the band prior to the recording of the album &quot;Summer in Paradise,&quot; supposedly because of a dispute about content; however, he returned during the sessions to sing lead vocals on two of the album&#x27;s songs and contributed to the partial re-recording of tracks for the UK release of the album.

Early in 1997, Carl Wilson was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour (a double-bill with the band Chicago) while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song. (David Marks rejoined the group in Carl’s absence, touring with Love, Jardine, and Johnston.) Carl died on February 6, 1998, at the age of 51, two months after the death of the Wilsons&#x27; mother, Audree.

After Carl’s death in 1998, Jardine was forced out of the touring version of the Beach Boys, leaving Love as the only original member in the group playing live concerts; Love retained David Marks (until Marks himself left in 1999) and Bruce Johnston in his group. Jardine continued to tour and recorded with his band, “Beach Boys’ Family and Friends, with a rotating line-up that utilized many former longtime Beach Boys touring members, including Billy Hinsche (originally from Dino, Desi and Billy before working with The Beach Boys), Ed Carter, Bobby Figueroa, and Daryl Dragon (better known as “The Captain” from Captain and Tennille after leaving The Beach Boys), alongside Jardine&#x27;s sons Matt (who himself had worked as an assistant stage manager for The Beach Boys from 1986 until 1988 and then as a member of the backing band, contributing percussion and vocals, from 1988 until 1998) and Adam, Brian Wilson’s daughters Carnie and Wendy (who had worked as a trio in Wilson Phillips and as a duo as The Wilsons), and Owen Elliot (the daughter of Cass Elliot of The Mamas and the Papas). (Jardine and his band were also promoted or billed under the banners &quot;Al Jardine, Beach Boy&quot; and &quot;Al Jardine of the Beach Boys&quot; during this time.)

Jardine began to perform regularly with his band &quot;Beach Boys: Family &amp; Friends&quot; until he ran into legal issues for using the name without a license from the band’s corporate holdings company (and occasional record label), BRI (Brother Records). (Love had already received a license from BRI after Carl’s death.) BRI and Love initiated legal action against Jardine after a 1999 show where promoters had incorrectly billed Jardine’s band as “The Beach Boys.”. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts, BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed. 

In 2002, Jardine and his band released his first solo live album, &quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot; (see discography section below for track listing). The amount of Jardine’s live appearances dwindled after the lawsuit, partially since Jardine had little name recognition when compared to “The Beach Boys” (touring band led by Love and Johnston) or Brian Wilson (touring solo).

The courts later ruled in favor of BRI and Love, in the dispute over The Beach Boys’ name and that of Jardine’s band “Beach Boys’ Family and Friends, denying Jardine the use of the Beach Boys name in any fashion. Jardine proceeded to appeal this decision in addition to seeking $4 million in damages. The California Court of Appeal ruled that Love acted wrongfully in freezing Jardine out of touring under the Beach Boys name, allowing Jardine to continue with his lawsuit. The case ended up being settled outside of court with the terms not disclosed 

In late 2006, Jardine joined Brian Wilson and his band for a short tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.

In March 2008, Jardine settled a lawsuit brought against him by BRI (led by Love and the estate of Carl Wilson) and Love regarding use of the &quot;Beach Boys&quot; name. Love had licensed the Beach Boys name, and it was deemed that Jardine&#x27;s newly formed band, called the &quot;Beach Boys Family &amp; Friends&quot; (featuring sons Matt and Adam Jardine, Carnie and Wendy Wilson, Daryl Dragon, Billy Hinsche, and others), was a breach of title use. During and after the lawsuit, Jardine was allowed to tour as “Al Jardine, Family, and Friends” and “Al Jardine and the Endless Summer Beach Band”.

In 2009, Jardine&#x27;s lead vocal on &quot;Big Sur Christmas&quot; was released on MP3 download, produced by longtime Red Barn Studios engineer Stevie Heger under Heger&#x27;s band&#x27;s name, Hey Stevie. The track also was released on the Hey Stevie album, &quot;Eloquence&quot;.

===2010–2019===
Jardine released &quot;A Postcard from California&quot;, his solo debut, in June 2010 (re-released with two extra tracks on April 3, 2012). The album features contributions from Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson (posthumously), Bruce Johnston, David Marks, and Mike Love. There are also guest appearances from Glen Campbell (who had frequently worked with The Beach Boys as a touring musician and session guitarist in the mid-1960s), David Crosby, Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Steve Miller, Scott Mathews, Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell (members of America) and Flea. A spoken intermission written by Stephen Kalinich, called &quot;Tidepool Interlude&quot;, features actor Alec Baldwin. Also in 2010, Brian Wilson and Jardine sang on &quot;We Are the World 25: for Haiti&quot;, a new recording of &quot;We Are the World&quot; (with partially revised lyrics), which was released as a charity single to benefit the population of Haiti.

Jardine made his first appearance with the Beach Boys touring band in more than 10 years in 2011 at a tribute concert for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 100th birthday; at this concert, he sang lead on &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. He made a handful of other appearances with Love and Johnston’s touring band in preparation for a reunion.

In December 2011, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston would reunite for a new Beach Boys album and The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour in 2012. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a &quot;special performance&quot; by organizers. It marked the group&#x27;s first live performance to include Wilson since 1996, Jardine since 1998, and Marks since 1999. Released on June 5, &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot; debuted at number 3 on the US charts, expanding the group&#x27;s span of &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top-ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing the Beatles with 47 years of top-ten albums. Critics generally regarded the album as an &quot;uneven&quot; collection, with most of the praise centered on its closing musical suite. The album features the song &quot;From There to Back Again,” on which Jardine shared lead vocals with Wilson. Critics have acclaimed Jardine&#x27;s performance in the song, with Ryan Reed of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine praising his &quot;stand-out lead vocal&quot;, while John Bush of Allmusic deemed the song the &quot;most beautiful&quot; in the album, having been &quot;impeccably&quot; framed by Wilson around Jardine&#x27;s &quot;aging but still sweet&quot; voice. (Also in 2012, David Marks released the album &quot;The Circle Continues&quot;, which featured a guest appearance from Jardine on vocals on the song &quot;I Sail Away&quot;.)

Ultimately, the reunion tour ended in September 2012 as planned, after a final show on September 28, but amid erroneous rumors that Love had dismissed Wilson from the Beach Boys. At this time, Love and Johnston had announced via a press release that following the end of the reunion tour the Beach Boys would revert to the pre-reunion tour Love/Johnston lineup, without Brian, Jardine, or Marks, all of whom expressed surprise. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks had been opposed to this decision, which was made by Love, but were unable to act on it because Love still had his pre-reunion license to use the band&#x27;s name, and all booked reunion dates had been fulfilled, allowing Love to boycott an extension of a reunion. Wilson had hoped to record another studio album as part of a continued reunion, and Jardine reportedly asked Love to reconsider his decision. However, Love was committed to touring only with Johnston and their touring band, though he was (at least briefly) open to the idea of recording another studio album.

Although such dates were noted in a late June issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, it was widely reported that the three had been &quot;fired&quot;. Love later wrote that the end of the reunion came partly as a result of &#x27;interference&#x27; from Brian&#x27;s wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter-Wilson and that he (Love) &quot;had wanted to send out a joint press release, between Brian and me, formally announcing the end of the reunion tour on September 28. But I couldn&#x27;t get Brian&#x27;s management team on board...&quot; On October 5, Love responded in a self-written press release to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stating he &quot;did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority. And even if I did, I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys.&quot; He claimed that nobody in the band &quot;wanted to do a 50th anniversary tour that lasted 10 years&quot; and that its limited run &quot;was long agreed upon&quot;. On October 9, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: &quot;I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn&#x27;t even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows.&quot;

From late September, Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks toured as a trio in 2013, and a subsequent tour with guitarist Jeff Beck also included Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Wilson and Jardine continued to tour together in 2014 and following years, often joined by Chaplin; Marks declined to join them after 2013.

Jardine has appeared at almost every single Brian Wilson concert or other performance since the end of the Beach Boys’ 50th Anniversary reunion tour in 2012, with very few exceptions. During this time, Jardine also continued to make sporadic solo appearances with his band.

In June 2013, Wilson&#x27;s website announced that he was recording and self-producing new material with Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, Don Was, and Jeff Beck. It stated that the material might be split into three albums: one of new pop songs, another of mostly instrumental tracks with Beck, and another of interwoven tracks dubbed &quot;the suite&quot; which initially began form as the closing four tracks of &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;. In January 2014, Wilson declared in an interview that the Beck collaborations would not be released. Released in April 2015, &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot; marked another collaboration between Wilson and Joe Thomas, featuring guest appearances from Jardine, Marks, Chaplin, and others. 

In 2016, Wilson and Jardine embarked on the Pet Sounds 50th Anniversary World Tour, promoted as Wilson&#x27;s final performances of the album, with Chaplin appearing as a special guest at all dates on select songs. Jardine has since contributed to all of Wilson&#x27;s tours since then. In July 2016, Jardine appeared in an episode of the Adult Swim series &quot;Decker&quot;, playing the role of the President&#x27;s &quot;science advisor&quot;. Jardine and his son Matt contributed backing vocals to John Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Emoji of a Wave&quot;, which was released in 2017. 

In 2018, Jardine began performing solo storyteller concerts called &quot;Al Jardine – A Postcard From California - From the Very First Song With a Founding Member of the Beach Boys&quot; which featured his son Matt and long time Peter Asher associate Jeff Alan Ross. Jardine continued to tour these shows into 2020, while still performing with the Brian Wilson band.

In July 2018, Wilson, Jardine, Love, Johnston, and Marks reunited for a one-off Q&amp;A session moderated by director Rob Reiner at the Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles. It was the first time the band had appeared together in public since their 2012 tour.

In April 2019, Jardine was inducted into the Rochester Music Hall of Fame. Also in 2019, Jardine and Marks performed at a benefit concert for charity (called &quot;California Saga 2&quot;) to raise money for the homeless. That same year, Wilson and Jardine (with Chaplin) embarked on a co-headlining tour with the Zombies, performing selections from &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

===2020–present===

In February 2020, Wilson and Jardine&#x27;s official social media pages encouraged fans to boycott the band&#x27;s music after it was announced that Love&#x27;s Beach Boys would perform at the Safari Club International Convention in Reno, Nevada on animal rights grounds. The concert proceeded despite online protests, as Love issued a statement that said his group has always supported &quot;freedom of thought and expression as a fundamental tenet of our rights as Americans.&quot; In October, Love and Johnston&#x27;s Beach Boys performed at a fundraiser for Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential re-election campaign; Wilson and Jardine again issued a statement that they had not been informed about this performance and did not support it.

In March 2020, Jardine was asked about a possible reunion and responded that the band would reunite for a string of live performances in 2021, although he believed a new album was unlikely. In response to reunion rumors, Love said in May that he was open to a 60th anniversary tour, although Wilson has &quot;some serious health issues&quot;, while Wilson&#x27;s manager Jean Sievers commented that no one had spoken to Wilson about such a tour. In February 2021, it was announced that Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson had sold a majority stake in the band&#x27;s intellectual property to Irving Azoff and his new company Iconic Artists Group; rumors of a 60th anniversary reunion were again discussed.

On February 12, 2021, Jardine released a CD single featuring a new rendition of his bonus track from &quot;A Postcard from California&quot; titled &quot;Waves of Love 2.0&quot; (as the A-side) and a new song &quot;Jenny Clover&quot; (as the B-side). It was co-written and produced by his long time collaborating partner Larry Dvoskin. A portion of the proceeds were earmarked to raise money for &quot;The World Central Kitchen&quot; charity org. In April 2021, Omnivore Recordings released &quot;California Music Presents Add Some Music&quot;, an album featuring Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and several children of the original Beach Boys (most notably on a re-recording of The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Add Some Music to Your Day&quot; from 1970&#x27;s &quot;Sunflower&quot;). Also in 2021, a live version of Wilson and Jardine performing &quot;In My Room&quot; at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee (recorded at an unknown time between 2013 and 2021) was released on the soundtrack album to the Wilson documentary &quot;Long Promised Road&quot;.

In 2022, the group was expected to participate in a &quot;60th anniversary celebration&quot;. Azoff stated in an interview from May 2021, &quot;We&#x27;re going to announce a major deal with a streamer for the definitive documentary on The Beach Boys and a 60th anniversary celebration. We&#x27;re planning a tribute concert affiliated with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and SiriusXM, with amazing acts. That&#x27;s adding value, and that&#x27;s why I invested in The Beach Boys.&quot; On Mike Love&#x27;s 81st birthday, Jardine once again hinted at a possible reunion on his Facebook page by stating that he was &quot;looking forward&quot; to seeing Love at the &quot;reunion&quot;; however, no reunion occurred.

Also in 2022, Jardine announced the &quot;Family &amp; Friends Tour&quot; featuring Carnie and Wendy Wilson of Wilson Phillips. “Family &amp; Friends” will also feature Al’s son, Matt Jardine; the eight-member band for the tour will be led by Carnie&#x27;s husband Rob Bonfiglio, who is Wilson Phillips’ musical director and performs regularly in Brian Wilson’s band. The band will also include long-time Beach Boys associates Ed Carter, Bobby Figueroa, and Probyn Gregory. That same year, Jardine made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Best Summer Ever&quot; by the group Drifting Sand, and he and Blondie Chaplin also participated in what turned out to be Wilson&#x27;s final tour, a co-headlining tour with the band Chicago. Since 2022, Jardine has been touring in two configurations: the &quot;Family and Friends&quot; configuration mentioned above and the &quot;Endless Summer Beach Band&quot; lineup (featuring all of the musicians in the &quot;Family and Friends&quot; configuration, minus Carnie and Wendy Wilson).

In January 2023, the tribute concert mentioned by Azoff in 2021 was announced as being part of the &quot;Grammys Salute&quot; series of televised tribute concerts. On February 8—three days after the 2023 Grammy award ceremonies, &quot;A Grammy Salute to the Beach Boys&quot; was recorded at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California and subsequently aired as a two-hour special on CBS on April 9. Present for the taping were Wilson, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Love—this time not as performers but as featured guests, seated in a luxury box at the theatre, overlooking tribute performances covering the gamut of their catalog by mostly contemporary artists. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the program had 5.18 million viewers.

In March 2024, the band announced the release of a self-titled documentary which would be released by streaming service Disney+, which includes new and archived interviews from various members of the band and their inner circle, including Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson, Chaplin, Fataar, Brian Wilson&#x27;s ex-wife Marilyn, and Don Was, among others. The documentary was directed by Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny and was released on May 24, 2024. The documentary included some footage from a private reunion of Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, and Johnston at Paradise Cove, where the &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; album cover photo was taken in 1962. Brian Wilson, Love, Jardine, Marks, Johnston, and Blondie Chaplin also participated in a non-performing reunion at the documentary&#x27;s premiere on May 24, 2024. 

In August 2024, Jardine released the single &quot;Wish&quot;, co-written and recorded with Dvoskin. In a September 2024 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to promote &quot;Wish&quot;, Jardine revealed that the song was written in the early 1990s, during a period in which Brian Wilson was not working regularly with the band; the song was therefore dedicated to, and inspired by Brian Wilson, and the late Dennis Wilson. Jardine will donate a portion of proceeds to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Jardine also announced that &quot;Wish&quot; would hopefully appear on a second solo album, for which he is planning to finish some unreleased songs. In the same interview, Jardine revealed that, with Brian Wilson&#x27;s permission for the use of his band and name, he is planning a tour with a reunited Brian Wilson Band, minus Brian himself; however, Jardine believed that Wilson could potentially participate in Los Angeles-area concerts. Jardine intends to start the tour itself in 2025, preceded by benefit concerts in 2024. He has tentatively planned for the setlist to include a mixture of deep cuts from the band&#x27;s 1970s albums, as well as their classic hits.

==Book==
Jardine has authored one book, &quot;Sloop John B: A Pirate&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2005), illustrated by Jimmy Pickering. The book is a children&#x27;s story about a boy&#x27;s Caribbean adventure with his grandfather, reworded from the original folk lyric of the song &quot;Sloop John B&quot;. It also includes a free CD with singalong acoustic recording by Jardine.

<doc id="706057" wikidata="Q359657" url="?curid=706057" title="2004 Democratic National Convention">
<text>The 2004 Democratic National Convention convened from July 26 to 29, 2004 at the FleetCenter (now the TD Garden) in Boston, Massachusetts, and nominated Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts for president and Senator John Edwards from North Carolina for vice president, respectively, in the 2004 presidential election.

The 2004 Democratic National Convention was famous because it included the keynote speech of Barack Obama, who would go on to be elected President four years later. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson served as chairman of the convention, while former presidential advisor to Bill Clinton, Lottie Shackelford, served as vice chairwoman of the convention.

The 2004 Democratic National Convention marked the formal end of the active primary election season, although all meaningful primary elections had finished months earlier. After the convention, John Kerry and John Edwards were defeated by the incumbent George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in the general election.

==Convention themes==
The 2004 Democratic National Convention featured a theme for each day of the convention. The first night of the meeting focused on the theme &quot;Plan for America&#x27;s Future&quot; with speeches devoted to building optimism for John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy. The second night of the meeting focused on the theme &quot;A Lifetime of Strength and Service&quot; devoted to John Kerry&#x27;s biography and his path to his nomination. The third night of the meeting focused on the theme &quot;A Stronger More Secure America&quot; devoted to issues of homeland security and the global war on terror. The last night of the meeting focused on the theme &quot;Stronger at Home, Respected in the World&quot; devoted to the overall agenda of the party to secure the borders, improving domestic welfare while at the same time promoting international cooperation in world affairs. The phrase &quot;Help is on the Way&quot; was often repeated by speakers such as John Edwards.

This was the first major party presidential nominating convention to be held since the terrorist attacks of September 11 attacks. During the convention, there was a memorial service to honor the victims of the attacks. Haleema Salie, who lost her daughter, son-in-law, and unborn grandchild on American Flight 11, spoke.

==Party platform==
The 2004 Democratic National Convention successfully passed an official party platform. A forty-three page document, the party platform was entitled &quot;Strong at Home, Respected in the World&quot; – also the name of the theme conveyed on the last night of the convention. The first part of the platform was called &quot;A Strong, Respected America&quot;. The section defined specific goals and actions to defeat terrorism, to keep weapons of mass destruction from the hands of terrorists, to promote world peace and security, to strengthen the military, to achieve energy independence and to strengthen homeland security. The second part of the platform was called, &quot;A Strong, Growing Economy&quot;. The section defined specific goals and actions to create what the party called &quot;good jobs&quot; and &quot;standing up for the great American middle class.&quot; The third part of the platform was called, &quot;Strong, Healthy Families.&quot; The section defined specific goals and actions to reform the healthcare system in the United States, to improve education and to protect the environment. The final part of the platform was called, &quot;A Strong American Community.&quot; It stressed the diversity of the nation and the importance of upholding civil rights as a major tenet of the party.

==Site selection==


After an initial notice to 34 cities, 10 cities requested the RFP to host the convention: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Miami, New York City and Pittsburgh. Of those, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Miami and New York City submitted bids. Baltimore&#x27;s bid was considered a long-shot. The city lacked a conventional venue with enough space to accommodate the convention, and was proposing the prospect of erecting a temporary canopy at Oriole Park at Camden Yards (which would have likely necessitated the baseball team tenant to vacate the venue for a roughly two-month period of their season). Baltimore was eliminated. Boston, Detroit, Miami and New York City were selected as the finalist cities. Each of the finalist cities received visits from members of the Democratic National Committee during the site selection process. Boston was announced as the host of the convention on November 13, 2002.

The 2004 Democratic National Convention was the first major party presidential nominating convention to held in Boston. With John Kerry arising as the winner of the primaries, it ultimately was one of the few presidential nominating conventions that was held in the home state of the party&#x27;s nominee.

As a result of the selection of Boston, organizers of the Reebok Pro Summer League developmental basketball program had to fold the league into the upstart Las Vegas Summer League due to a lack of lodging in the Boston area.

Until Chicago, Illinois was selected as the host of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, 2004 was the last time for either major party that they chose to hold their convention in a state that was not considered to be a swing state (the Republicans held their 2004 convention in New York City).

==Logistics==
===Security===
During the convention, U.S. Capitol Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other governmental organizations took many security measures to protect the participants of the Democratic National Convention. Security measures included bomb-sniffing dogs, 7-feet high metal barricades, a ban on corporate and private flights at Logan International Airport, along with the temporary closure of Interstate 93.

===Police union===
Other Bostonians took advantage of the meeting as a national stage for specific agendas. The police union, for example, gained attention with threats of picketing of delegates from entering and exiting functions – a dilemma for Democrats as the party has traditionally been an ally of organized labor. Having worked without a contract for two years, the Boston Police Patrolmen&#x27;s Association struck a deal with Boston mayor Thomas Menino for a new contract, avoiding a major embarrassment for the party.

==Barack Obama&#x27;s keynote address==

State Senator Barack Obama, the Illinois Democratic candidate for United States Senate, delivered the convention&#x27;s keynote address on Tuesday, July 27, 2004. His unexpected landslide victory in the March 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate Democratic primary had made him overnight a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;. His keynote address, although not carried by the commercial broadcast television networks, was well received, which further elevated his status within the Democratic Party and led to his reissued memoir becoming a bestseller.
As the keynote speaker, Obama set the tone for the party platform. His speech, proclaiming the unnecessary and artificial divides in American culture and politics, was reminiscent of John Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Two Americas&quot; stump speech: &quot;There&#x27;s not a liberal America and a conservative America—there&#x27;s the &quot;United States&quot; of America.&quot; Obama emphasized the importance of unity, and made veiled jabs at the Bush administration and the news media&#x27;s perceived oversimplification and diversionary use of wedge issues: &quot;We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don&#x27;t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states, and yes, we&#x27;ve got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq, and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the Stars and Stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.&quot;

Obama noted his interracial and international heritage: he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to a Kenyan immigrant father and a white mother from Kansas. He emphasized the power of education, recounting the privilege of attending the exclusive Punahou School and Harvard Law School despite his family&#x27;s poverty, and criticized the perception that poor black youths who read books are &quot;acting white.&quot; He went on to describe his successful career in law and politics while raising a family in Chicago. &quot;In no other country on Earth is my story even possible&quot;, Obama proclaimed. Towards the end of his speech, he emphasized the importance of hope in the American saga, and he illustrated how that hope manifested itself in the lives of John Kerry, John Edwards, and even his own personal life, as &quot;a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him too.&quot; According to Obama, the &quot;audacity of hope&quot; is &quot;God&#x27;s greatest gift&quot; to Americans, allowing him to feel optimistic that the lives of average Americans can be improved with the right governmental policies. Following the speech political commentator Chris Matthews rightly predicted &quot;I just saw the first black president&quot;.

==Edwards&#x27; address==

Not yet formally nominated for the vice presidency, John Edwards took the stage at the convention to give the first major national speech of his political career. Delegates raised red-and-white vertical &quot;Edwards&quot; banners and chanted his name. The theme of Edwards&#x27;s address was the divide between the &quot;two Americas&quot;, his populist message throughout the primary campaign and now one embraced by Kerry. He tied the division to his own roots in North Carolina, and introduced his family to the audience. Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: &quot;You taught me the values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for everyone. You taught me that there&#x27;s dignity and honor in a hard day&#x27;s work. You taught me to always look out for our neighbors, to never look down on anybody, and treat everybody with respect.&quot;
Edwards went on to define the two Americas he claimed to exist, one for the rich and one for the poor, and repeated several times that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way.&quot; He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients&#x27; Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that &quot;None of us believe that the quality of a child&#x27;s education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community.&quot; He appealed for the end of the two economies, &quot;one for people who are set for life, they know their kids and grand-kids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck.&quot; Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: &quot;We&#x27;re going to roll back – we&#x27;re going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we&#x27;re going to close corporate loopholes. We&#x27;re going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren.&quot;

Many pundits noted that while Edwards&#x27;s charismatic style was in evidence, he had rushed through the speech, ending several minutes earlier than planned. The delegates in the FleetCenter, however, were enraptured, and Edwards led them several times in a statement-response chant: &quot;Hope is on the way.&quot; This, and the general upbeat tone of the address, was a response to attacks by the Bush campaign claiming that Kerry and Edwards were pessimistic and cynical; it was altered and echoed the next day in the more detailed speech of John Kerry: &quot;Help is on the way.&quot;

==Results of delegate voting==
In the days before the convention started, the other candidates withdrew, freed their delegates and officially endorsed Kerry. All the delegates voted to ratify this decision and vote for Kerry, except those of Kucinich, who attempted to vote for Kucinich anyway. Many states refused to let them do so, and only permitted them to register abstentions. The final tally went thus:

===President===
===Vice president===
*John Edwards was chosen by acclamation.

==Kerry&#x27;s address==

Prior to his speech, John Kerry&#x27;s daughter spoke about her father. After this, a video played, showing highlights from Kerry&#x27;s life, including his birth in Colorado, his childhood in New England, the travels with his diplomat father to post-World War II Germany, and his service in Vietnam&#x27;s Mekong Delta, interspersed with clips of Kerry speaking and narrated voice overs. After the video&#x27;s conclusion, former U.S. Senator Max Cleland delivered a speech proclaiming that the global conflict and active wars in Afghanistan and Iraq required a decorated military hero such as Kerry in the White House. This concluded with Kerry&#x27;s entrance, where he made a military salute and announced, &quot;I&#x27;m John Kerry, and I&#x27;m reporting for duty!&quot; Kerry then accepted the nomination for president.

Democrats reacted positively to John Kerry&#x27;s acceptance speech. With Democrats strongly opposed to the Bush administration, John Kerry spent most of his speech appealing to independent voters and to swing voters. He promised to train 40,000 new active duty troops, to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, to cut the national deficit in half within four years, to cut middle class taxes while repealing the Bush administration&#x27;s tax cuts for those making more than US$200,000 per year, to stop privatization of Social Security, and to expand stem cell research.

On the day after Kerry&#x27;s speech, George W. Bush&#x27;s reelection campaign launched a counterattack on the claims and promises made by Kerry and others at the convention. At a campaign stop in Springfield, Missouri, Bush told a crowd: &quot;My opponent has good intentions, but intentions do not always translate to results&quot;, attacking Senator Kerry&#x27;s record in the Senate.

==Other speakers==

In addition to the Obama, Edwards, and Kerry addresses, there were also speeches from former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, former vice-president and 2000 presidential nominee Al Gore, New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary Clinton, Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy, former candidate Al Sharpton, and presidential advisory counsel on HIV/AIDS Denise Stokes. Ron Reagan, son of Republican president Ronald Reagan, also spoke at the convention, blaming Bush&#x27;s hijacking of his father&#x27;s legacy for his switch in support to the Democrats.

==Lack of convention &#x27;bounce&#x27;==
Polls conducted after Kerry&#x27;s speech showed no significant increase of support (or &quot;convention bounce&quot;) for the Democratic nominee&#x27;s bid to unseat President Bush. Democrats ascribed the disappointing numbers to an unusually polarized electorate that year with few undecided voters, though Bush did get a small bounce out of his convention.

==Demonstrations and protests==
There were a number of demonstrations during the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Protesters included members of the Bl(A)ck Tea Society, a group of self-described anarchists, who opposed the war in Iraq. Approximately 400 members of the Bl(A)ck Tea Society marched through Boston&#x27;s financial district and headed toward the FleetCenter, where they set fire to an effigy that showed George Bush on one side and John Kerry on the other.

That evening a group of peace activists held a peaceful rally a few hundred feet from the FleetCenter. Local Boston politicians were joined by presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich and long-time activist and California state senator Tom Hayden in a call to end the occupation of and to remove U.S. troops from Iraq and to bring in an international peacekeeping force. Also, Hayden and Kucinich called on anti-war Democrats to support John Kerry against George Bush in the general election.

The largest protest was held on the Sunday evening before the convention was set to start. An estimated 2,000 anti-war members marched at the same time as approximately 1,000 anti-abortion activists, and the two groups crossed paths en route to the convention center. The following day, this anti-abortion group had its permit revoked to protest outside of the Kerry family home. They challenged the decision, but it was upheld by a federal judge, who sided with the Secret Service in determining that the protest would be too close to Kerry&#x27;s home, potentially endangering the presidential candidate.

<text>The Local Government Act 2003 (c. 26) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It made various changes to the administration of local government in the United Kingdom. Although it contained mainly financial provisions, section 122 repealed section 2A of the Local Government Act 1986, the enactment prohibiting local authorities from &#x27;promoting&#x27; homosexuality, in England and Wales.

It also created the concept of &quot;business improvement districts&quot;.

<text>Zyklon was a Norwegian blackened death metal band formed in 1998 by Samoth and Trym of Emperor, along with members of Myrkskog. Their style has been described as modern death metal with black and industrial undertones. After more than a two-year hiatus, the band officially split up in January 2010.

All the band&#x27;s lyrics were written by former Emperor drummer Faust, then member of Casey Chaos&#x27; side project Scum and Italian industrial black metal band Aborym.

Despite Samoth having been in a previous Emperor side project called Zyklon-B, the two are not related; Zyklon B is the name of a lethal gas used by the Nazis during the Holocaust; &quot;Zyklon&quot; is, according to Samoth, a play on the word &quot;cyclone&quot;, since the word is spelled &quot;syklon&quot; in Norwegian.

==History==

Zyklon&#x27;s debut album, &quot;World ov Worms&quot; (2001), showcased fast riffing and blast beats. However, after this release, Zyklon&#x27;s line-up changed drastically, and the official line-up became Samoth, Trym Torson, Destructhor, and Secthdamon.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Aeon&quot; (2003), exposed the band to media attention, and videos were made for two tracks, &quot;Core Solution&quot; and &quot;Psyklon Aeon&quot;.

The band&#x27;s third effort was recorded from November to December 2005 at the Akkerhaugen Lydstudio in Norway; &quot;Disintegrate&quot; was released in May 2006. In October 2007, the band went on hiatus, before splitting up 15 months later.

The island forms part of the southern boundary of the New Georgia Sound; to the northwest the Vella Gulf separates it from Vella Lavella and Gizo, while to the southeast New Georgia lies across the Kula Gulf. West-southwest of Kolombangara is Ghizo Island, upon which the Western provincial capital Gizo is located. The island is heavily forested, with few inhabitants. There are two notable settlements, Ringgi and Mongga, the former being the larger. The most significant industry on the island is logging, principally based at Poitete.

==Environment==
Two sites associated with the island have been identified by BirdLife International as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) because they support populations of threatened or restricted range bird species.
The Kolombangara Upland Forest IBA comprises 30,963 ha of forested land covering the central caldera and the high ridges of Mounts Veve and Rano, with four corridors down through lowland forest to the coast. The birds include yellow-legged pigeons, crested cuckoo-doves, Mayr&#x27;s swiftlets, Roviana rails, Heinroth&#x27;s shearwaters, Sanford&#x27;s sea eagles, Meek&#x27;s lorikeets, black-faced pittas, North Melanesian cuckooshrikes, white-winged fantails, Kolombangara monarchs, Kolombangara leaf warblers and Kolombangara white-eyes. The Kolombangara Marine IBA covers some 80,000 ha of marine waters around the island, the site boundaries based on a seaward extension of 7 km from the coast, to encompass foraging and transit areas for the Heinroth&#x27;s shearwaters that are believed to breed in the uplands of the island.

==History==
The first recorded sighting of Kolombangara by western explorers was in 1568 by the Spanish explorer Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira. On March 15, 1893 Kolombangara was declared part of the British Solomon Islands protectorate. The island was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the early stages of the Pacific War.

===Archeology===
Led by Roger Green and Douglas Yen, the Southeast Solomon Islands Cultural History Programme (1970-1972) delved into archipelagic agricultural systems. In 1971, Yen and team explored Kolombangara, revealing promising irrigation remnants.

Over 30 days, collaborating with locals unveiled Ndughore Valley&#x27;s cultural landscape during early European contact. Limited 1971 knowledge hindered Kolombangara research dissemination. Despite this, the expanded Western Solomons&#x27; archaeological record enriches understanding, contributing to New Georgia&#x27;s early European contact insights. Logging since 1971 likely caused significant archaeological site destruction.

==== The Ingoana of the Ndughore Valley ====
Kolombangara, a circular extinct stratovolcano 15 km in diameter and 1770 m high at Mt. Veve, lies northwest of New Georgia Island. The Ndughore Valley, carved into the island&#x27;s southwestern flank, stretches 6 km inland, with Ghatere village at its mouth.

The Ndughore Valley choice for study was influenced by extensive remains of former Ghatere agricultural systems, known as Ingoana. Pahu, Ghatere&#x27;s oldest resident and main informant, traced his genealogy four generations back to Valaka, the Ingoana&#x27;s founding ancestor. Descendants of the Ndughore &#x27;tribe,&#x27; once among seven tribes on Kolombangara, the Ingoana traditionally occupied land from north of Hunda to beyond Iriri. During the visit, Ingoana of Iriri and Ghatere were separated by Vavanga and Papele villages. Kolombangara inhabitants spoke Nduke, a single Austronesian language.

Pahu&#x27;s cosmogonic account places the Kolombangara people&#x27;s origin in the central caldera. Pre-colonial pacification saw them in small interior hamlets. European arrival and firearms led to hamlet modification for defence and shelter creation.

Early European contact introduced disease, causing social disruption and depopulation. Simultaneously, subsistence changes saw men adopting migration as a way of life. Shifting cultivation on interior ridges vanished, and stone-faced pond field irrigation ceased by the late 1930s. Economic shifts from taro-dominated to yam-sweet potato agriculture by 1971 reflect agricultural technology regression or &#x27;disintensification.&#x27;

==== Irrigation and Agriculture in the Ndughore Valley ====
Bayliss-Smith et al. (2003) examined rainforest composition and human disturbance history in the western Solomon Islands, describing an agroforestry system in the Marovo Lagoon region of New Georgia Island around 1800. This system included irrigated taro pond fields, mixed bush-fallow swiddens producing dryland taro and yams, and fallow secondary forest enriched with Canarium nut trees.

The same three components constituted the traditional agricultural regime on Kolombangara, based on discussions with Ghatere elders and observations in the Ndughore valley. The swidden component left little trace, but the tree component, including Canarium nut trees, breadfruit, sago, and betel nut trees, was evident. Canarium or nali nut held cultural importance, featuring in feasts and preparation areas at archaeological sites.

The most noticeable traces of the former three-tier agricultural system were linked to irrigated pond fields. Ghatere people guided researchers to formerly irrigated complexes in the Ndughore valley. Archaeological remains of irrigation are now described, with sites numbered using Roger Green&#x27;s system. Notably:

Daratovu (sites SN-4-10 and -11): Two small ovulologha irrigation systems were located on steep side channels of the upper Ndughore River at Daratovu. Both had stone terraces running across narrow, steep stream channels, forming &#x27;barrage&#x27; terracing.

Aghara (site SN-4-1): Aghara irrigation complex, recorded by A. M. Hocart in 1908, featured terraces dammed with stones. Mapped in 1971, it included 43 stone-faced pond fields organized into subsystems. Radiocarbon dating suggested the system&#x27;s age range from AD 1504-1590 to AD 1616-modern.

Agegelai (site SN-4-4): The most extensive irrigation system recorded, Agegelai, was located upstream of Aghara on the north bank of the Ndughore River. Mapped in 1971, it had 91 individual pond fields, well-constructed stone retaining walls, and a hydrologically complex design utilizing water from the Ndughore River and a small tributary.

==== Ridgetop Settlements and Fortifications ====
Seven sites on the northwestern side of the Ndughore Valley were surveyed, with triangulated locations indicated in Figure 1 using compass bearings in the pre-GPS era. Two main clusters emerged: sites SN-4-2, -6, and -9 on the ridge above the Aghara and Agegelai irrigation complexes, and SN-4-12, -13, and -5 on a higher ridge further inland.

Site SN-4-7: On the ridge to Patusugha, an earth oven and a flat stone with indentations for cracking nali (canarium) nuts were noted. Marked for further investigation as Site SN-4-7, no further exploration occurred.

Patusugha (site SN-4-2): Spanning the western ridge overlooking the Ndughore valley, Patusugha, at an elevation of approximately 200 m, was where cultivators of the Aghara irrigation system once lived. Accessible by climbing a steep ridge from Aghara, the site covered about 70 m of ridge, with scattered house foundations, stone outbuildings, or earth terraces. Excavations provided insights into the site&#x27;s historical and cultural aspects.

Heriana (site SN-4-6): A small settlement on the same ridge as Patusugha, but at a higher elevation, Heriana had no fortification features. Cleared, mapped, and excavated, the site, described by informant Pahu, revealed four distinct features, including house foundations and earth ovens, shedding light on its structure and occupation period.

Vavalondu (site SN-4-9): Further inland on the same ridge as Heriana, Vavalondu occupied a gently sloping area on the ridge crest, featuring an ancestral shrine, house foundations, and anvil stones for processing nali nuts. Insights into ritual practices and daily activities were gleaned from this site.

Hena (site SN-4-12): Characterized as a small site of special function on a flat-topped mound, Hena contained an ancestral shrine supported by a stone-faced terrace. Two rectangular platforms flanked the terrace with anthropomorphic facial motifs. While the exact nature of activities at Hena remained unclear, the presence of ritual elements was evident.

Domana (site SN-4-13): Identified as a small ritual site, Domana consisted of a prominent upright volcanic slab flanked by fallen volcanic slabs. Referred to as a &quot;devil&#x27;s place&quot; by informants, no additional information on its function or purpose was provided.

Ivivu (site SN-4-5): The highest and most inland site, Ivivu, was a fortified hamlet modified for musket attacks. Situated on a steep ridge, Ivivu featured level terraces and platforms, defensive fosses, and a protective stone wall. An ancestral shrine at the site contained human remains, shell valuables, and pottery sherds, highlighting defensive modifications and potential historical disturbances.

In summary, the survey of these northwestern Ndughore Valley sites revealed diverse features, including irrigation complexes, settlement sites, and ritual and defensive structures, providing valuable insights into their historical, cultural, and functional aspects.

==== The Ndughore Settlement Landscape in Broader New Georgia Islands Context ====
Decades after the 1971 fieldwork on Kolombangara, renewed archaeological research in the New Georgia Group has established a regional cultural sequence for the Ndughore settlement landscape in the wider New Georgia Islands context. The &#x27;Munda tradition,&#x27; defined by Walter and Sheppard based on Roviana lagoon research, spans the Bao period (1200 to 400 BC) and the Roviana period (400 BC to European contact). The latter witnessed new architectural forms, settlement patterns, and material culture, including coral-rubble skull shrines, fortification sites, and shell rings like hokata arm rings and bakiha rings of tridacna shell.

This distinctive New Georgia cultural system, predating European contact, intensified in the nineteenth century due to increased trade. Andrew Cheyne&#x27;s 1844 trading post on Simbo Island linked iron axe heads to ritualised headhunting, especially with the introduction of muskets. Headhunting and the turtle shell trade intertwined in the late nineteenth century, contributing to ongoing feuds and retaliatory raids that depopulated many parts of the archipelago.

Insights into this nineteenth-century cultural system come from the archaeological landscape of Kolombangara&#x27;s Ndughore Valley. The economic base of the Ingoana people included swidden cultivation, arboriculture centred on canarium (nali nuts), and pond irrigation of taro. The Agegelai terraced system in the Ndughore Valley, with its complexity and well-designed canal network, constitutes a sophisticated irrigation system. Pig rearing, not extensively discussed in the New Georgia region, is documented in the Ndughore Valley sites, with surplus from irrigated taro fields likely supporting pig herds, contributing to ritualised feasting and status competition.

Settlement patterns emphasised defence and fortification during increased inter-island raiding and headhunting. Residential sites like Patusugha, Heriana, and Vavalondu were on defensible hilltops, resembling small hamlets. Ivivu, modified in response to firearms, deviated from this pattern. Specialised ritual sites, such as Hena and Domana, were also part of the settlement pattern.

Ancestral shrines in the Ndughore valley align with the broader pattern for New Georgia, conferring power in headhunting raids and participating in the regional shell exchange network. While the archaeology of Kolombangara Island remains little known, the study of Ndughore Valley sites sheds light on settlement patterns, economic production systems, and external exchange relationships during the early European contact period.

===World War II===
During World War II the island and the waters around it were the scene of much fighting. The Imperial Japanese Army used an airstrip on some flat ground at Vila on the south shore of the island, and in May 1943 based several military units with over ten thousand troops garrisoned on the southeast side of the island under the command of Major General Minoru Sasaki, in an attempt to establish a defence line through the Central Solomons. Naval battles nearby included the Battle of Kula Gulf and Battle of Kolombangara.

The most famous and bloody battle was the mission to intercept the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; supply convoy which resulted in the ramming and explosion of U.S. torpedo boat PT-109, manned by John F. Kennedy and his crew. Australian coastwatcher, Sub Lieutenant Arthur Reginald Evans, who manned a secret observation post at the top of the island&#x27;s Mount Veve volcano, spotted the explosion. After decoding news that the explosion he had witnessed was probably from the lost &quot;PT-109&quot; he dispatched Solomon Islanders Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana in a dugout canoe to look for possible survivors. Their efforts led to the subsequent discovery and rescue of John F. Kennedy and the surviving crew.

After destroyers succeeded in sinking the supply ships three nights later and isolating the garrison of 12,400 there, US forces were able to &quot;leapfrog&quot; Kolombangara to land on Vella Lavella to the west. The Japanese evacuated Kolombangara between September 23 and October 4, 1943.

In January 1944 a detachment of 1 officer and 6 enlisted men from the 350th Engineer General Service Regiment stationed at Munda, established a vegetable farm on the abandoned Japanese airstrip at Vila. The British government furnished 16 male natives to help with the project. With seeds acquired through the International Red Cross, many vegetables were sent back to the base hospital to supplement the dehydrated meals served the recuperating veterans. The main item was watermelons.

===Post-World War II===
Since 1978, the island has been part of the independent state of Solomon Islands.

Beginning in 2019, the Chinese state-owned China Forestry Group Corporation expressed interest in purchasing the hardwood forestry plantation that makes up much of the island, including a port and former airstrip that could be used as a base for Chinese military assets.

He is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, first elected in a 2006 by-election to represent the riding of Toronto—Danforth.

In 2009, he entered the party leadership convention but lost to Andrea Horwath. Following Horwath&#x27;s resignation as leader after the 2022 Ontario general election, the Ontario New Democratic Party caucus unanimously recommended Tabuns&#x27; selection as the Ontario NDP&#x27;s interim leader. His appointment was confirmed by the party&#x27;s provincial council on June 28, 2022. He served until the election of his successor, Marit Stiles, following the leadership election.

As of August 11, 2024, he serves as the Official Opposition critic for Energy and Climate Action.

== Background ==
Tabuns was born in London, Ontario, to Anton Tabuns (), an auto mechanic, and his wife Sarah, who was born and raised in Liverpool, England. Anton was born and raised in Latvia, though he managed to leave his homeland after the Soviet occupation and immigrate to England. While working on a farm, fixing equipment, he met Sarah, and soon after marrying, the couple immigrated to Canada. Soon after, the family found residence with another recent immigrant. In addition to Peter, Anton and Sarah have two other children, Frank and Anna.

Tabuns attended York University, where he studied political science and was actively involved in York&#x27;s student council. Tabuns was also president of &quot;Citizens for a Safe Environment&quot;, a Riverdale environmental group that lobbied the city to end garbage incineration at the Commissioners Street plant in the Port Lands. He became managing director of a housing co-op on Oak Street, and was also vice-chair of the Co-operative Housing Federation of Toronto.

He lives with Shawn Kerwin, who is a theatre designer and professor at York University. They have a son, Anton, from Tabuns&#x27; previous relationship.

== Municipal politics ==
Tabuns was city councillor for Ward 8 - Riverdale - of the former City of Toronto from 1990 to 1997, representing part of the Toronto-Danforth riding he now represents provincially. He was a member of the Board of Health for seven years, and was chair from 1993 to 1997. In 1995 he moved to ban smoking in shopping mall food courts. A year later the city extended the ban to include bars and restaurants.

In 1996, he supported a boycott of Harvey&#x27;s restaurants because its parent company Cara Operations had donated money to the Progressive Conservative Party for the previous three years. The Board of Health initially passed the motion 7-6 but later rescinded it following a storm of protest. Tabuns was unrepentant and said that corporations must be held accountable for supporting Ontario Premier Mike Harris. Tabuns said, &quot;What Mike Harris has done is put greased skids under the economy of this city and pushed it downhill.&quot;

In 1997 the amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto reduced the number of councillor positions. Tabuns was forced to compete with fellow NDP councillors Pam McConnell (who had previously represented Ward 7, adjacent to Tabuns&#x27; Ward 8) and Jack Layton (who had held a seat on Metro Council representing the same area as Wards 7 and 8) for one of two council positions returned by the east-end ward. A phantom candidate named &quot;Larry Tabin&quot; also entered the election. It has been alleged that Tabin was enlisted as a candidate by bar and restaurant owners seeking to defeat Tabuns over his anti-smoking initiative; despite his presence on the ballot, Tabin did not actually conduct any visible campaign. In the confusion, Tabin was able to draw enough votes away from Peter Tabuns to cost Tabuns the election. Tabuns came in third, with about 200 fewer votes than McConnell.

== Greenpeace ==
From 1999 to 2004, Tabuns was executive director of Greenpeace Canada. Under Tabuns&#x27; leadership, the organization advocated for environmental protection, including the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. Tabuns also served as special advisor on climate change to Jack Layton from 2004 to 2005.

Tabuns was criticized by some members of Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) local 343 (now Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union 343) in 2002, when Greenpeace terminated its door-to-door fundraising efforts and transferred foot canvassers to telephone fundraising. No layoffs occurred; however, several workers disputed Greenpeace&#x27;s assertions that the new positions were of &quot;comparable salary and benefits&quot;, and held an information picket outside Greenpeace offices. According to the union, the &quot;circumstances surrounding the closure of the door canvass were amicably resolved&quot;.

== Federal politics==
Tabuns ran as the NDP candidate in the riding of Beaches—East York during the 2004 federal election. He lost the election to Liberal incumbent Maria Minna by 7,738 votes.

== Provincial politics ==

On February 15, 2006, the Toronto—Danforth NDP riding association nominated Tabuns as the party&#x27;s candidate in the provincial by-election, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of former NDP Member of Provincial Parliament Marilyn Churley. Churley resigned her provincial seat in order to run in the 2006 federal election as the NDP candidate for Beaches-East York.

Tabuns&#x27; opponents in the election were former broadcaster and Liberal candidate Ben Chin, Progressive Conservative candidate Georgina Blanas and Green Party candidate Paul Charbonneau. On March 30, 2006, Tabuns won the by-election with 47.8% support from voters.

Upon being sworn in as an MPP, NDP Leader Howard Hampton reorganized his shadow cabinet and gave the rookie member a long list of portfolios, including Transportation, Environment, Public Infrastructure Renewal, Greater Toronto Area, Culture, Tourism and Recreation, Citizenship and Immigration, and Multicultural Affairs.

In October 2006, Tabuns was voted Best MPP by &quot;Now Magazine&quot; readers, for his positions on climate change, the Portlands Energy Centre, and early childhood learning centres in his constituency. Tabuns has also been known for his stance on same-sex parental rights, anti-toxics legislation and recognition of foreign credentials. In the same month, Tabuns was recognized for tabling a motion to recognize June 22, 2006 as Chinese Canadian Head Tax Redress Day.

Tabuns was re-elected in the 2007, 2011, 2014, 2018 and 2022 provincial elections.

He served as the party&#x27;s interim leader, after previously serving as the party&#x27;s critic on energy and climate change and before that critic for Education and Energy issues.

=== 2009 leadership bid ===

Following the resignation of party leader Howard Hampton in June 2008, Peter Tabuns was mentioned in the press as a likely candidate in the emerging campaign for the leadership. On October 27, 2008, Tabuns officially launched his campaign for the leadership. The party&#x27;s leadership convention was held in March 2009. Tabuns lost to Andrea Horwath by a margin of 60% to 40% on the third ballot following the defeat of contenders Michael Prue and Gilles Bisson in earlier rounds.

=== Interim Leader ===

On June 13, 2022, the 31 members of the Ontario NDP caucus elected in the 2022 Ontario general election met and unanimously endorsed Peter Tabuns to serve as interim party leader pending the outcome of its forthcoming leadership election. Following this recommendation by caucus, his appointment was confirmed by the party&#x27;s provincial council on June 28, 2022. Marit Stiles became the leader following a leadership election that was held on February 4, 2023.

<text>First Hawaiian Center is the second tallest building in the U.S. state of Hawaii and the city of Honolulu, the largest city in the state. It is the world corporate headquarters of First Hawaiian Bank, the oldest and largest bank based in Hawaii. The tower is one of the most well-known buildings in Honolulu, with a striking presence at the center of downtown Honolulu&#x27;s skyline.

==Description==
Located at 999 Bishop Street in downtown Honolulu near Bishop Park, the First Hawaiian Center is the world corporate headquarters of First Hawaiian Bank, Hawaii&#x27;s oldest bank and multibillion-dollar company established by Charles Reed Bishop, consort of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop.
First Hawaiian Center features the 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) of open plaza, park space and waterways in the middle of downtown Honolulu&#x27;s financial district cityscape of towering commercial buildings and congested streets. It is within walking distance of the Aliiōlani Hale, Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, Hawaii State Capitol and Iolani Palace. Considered a &quot;unique marriage of commerce and the arts,&quot; First Hawaiian Center features three galleries programmed by the Honolulu Museum of Art. (The gallery spaces were formerly curated by The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu). The gallery exhibits works by Hawaii-based artists.

The First Hawaiian Center is home to the Innovation Center Pacific.

==Development==
First Hawaiian Center was completed and opened in 1996 by chairman and chief executive officer of First Hawaiian Bank Walter A. Dods. With over 645,834 square feet (60,000 m2) of space and a height of 429 feet (131 m), the building cost over USD $175 million to construct. The architects were from the firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.

==Architecture==
First Hawaiian Center planning was met with controversy as Hawaii residents became concerned about the effect skyscrapers would have on the Hawaiian landscape. Architects compromised with the use of Hawaiian architectural principles used in most contemporary Honolulu urban projects like those employed by architects of the Hawaii Convention Center. Metaphoric designs were used in reference to natural phenomena found in Hawaii.

Two distinct architectural forms resulted in the compromise, one for the &quot;&quot; side facing the ocean and one for the &quot;&quot; side facing the mountains. Horizontally louvered windows framed views of the sea and the horizon while vertically proportioned windows faced the mountains. A great deal of effort was made to incorporate as much natural light as possible into the building interiors.

<doc id="706076" wikidata="Q7079248" url="?curid=706076" title="Office of Insular Affairs">
<text>The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) is a unit of the United States Department of the Interior that oversees federal administration of several United States insular areas. It is the successor to the Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Department, which administered certain territories from 1902 to 1939, and the Office of Territorial Affairs (formerly the Division of Territories and Island Possessions and then the Office of Territories) in the Interior Department, which was responsible for certain territories from the 1930s to the 1990s. The word &quot;insular&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;insula&quot; (&quot;island&quot;).

Currently, the OIA has administrative responsibility for coordinating federal policy in the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and oversight of federal programs and funds in the freely associated Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.

The OIA, led by the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Insular Areas, also has jurisdiction of &quot;excluded areas&quot; of Palmyra Atoll and &quot;residual administration&quot; of Wake Island.

Relations between the United States and Puerto Rico are coordinated between the Office of the Deputy Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, not the OIA.

==History==
The office has evolved over the years along with changes in administration and in United States territories.

Prior to the 1930s, responsibility for administration of United States possessions was divided among several government departments. Alaska and Hawaii were under the Interior Department; Puerto Rico and the Philippine Islands were administered by the Bureau of Insular Affairs in the War Department; and the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa were administered by the United States Department of the Navy.

===Division of Territories and Island Possessions===
The Division of Territories and Island Possessions, from 1934 to 1950 was responsible for administering the Interior Department&#x27;s responsibilities over the territories and island possessions of the United States that were consolidated into the Interior Department. Under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior, the Division served as a mediator between the territories and Federal government by performing administrative activities for the territorial governments and taking on colonization projects that furthered the interests of the United States in those areas.

The Division was established within the Interior Department on May 29, 1934 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Executive Order 6726 pursuant of the Economy Act of March 20, 1933 which required the President to reorganize the Executive branch. The Executive Order transferred the administrative functions over Puerto Rico from the Bureau of Insular Affairs War Department to the newly formed division.

On February 13, 1936 by Secretary Order 1040, the Division was assigned responsibilities from the Interior Department over territorial affairs in Alaska, the Alaska Railroad project, the Alaska Road Commission, and the jurisdiction over the Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In May 1936 and March 1938 by Executive Order 7368 and Executive Order 7828, Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Canton Island, and Enderbury Island were placed under the Interior Department and assigned to the Division.

On July 1, 1939, the Bureau of Insular Affairs War Department and its functions, including its administrative responsibilities over the Philippine Islands was transferred to the Interior Department and consolidated with the Division by the Reorganization Plan No. II of 1939.

In 1943, the Division was reorganized into three geographic and two functional branches: Hawaii and the Philippine Islands, Alaska, and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Legal, and Administrative.

In 1949, the Division&#x27;s administrative responsibilities were expanded to include Guam by Executive Order 10077 and made effective July 1, 1950 by Executive Order 10137. In 1950, the Office of Territories was established and the functions of the Division were transferred to the Office by the Secretarial Order No. 2577.

The first Director of Territories was Ernest Gruening, who served from 1934 to 1939, and later served as the territorial governor of Alaska and then as one of the first senators elected from Alaska upon statehood.

The major publication from the Division is the Annual Reports of the Department of the Interior that has a section on the Division of Territories and Island Possessions written by the Director outlining the Division&#x27;s activities over the past fiscal year. Additionally, the Division published general information serial pamphlets on Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and later general information on the Trust Territory. The Division also published specific reports pertaining to Alaska&#x27;s postwar period and road and agricultural development efforts, as well as a report on surplus property of its administrative areas.

===Office of Territories===
In 1950, the Division&#x27;s name was changed to the Office of Territories and the office&#x27;s work was significantly reduced in 1952 after Puerto Rico attained commonwealth status and in 1959 Alaska and Hawaii were granted statehood.

=== Office of Territorial Affairs ===
In 1971, the Office of Territories was temporarily abolished and administration was coordinated by a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Territorial Affairs in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Land Management. In 1973, the agency was reconstituted as the Office of Territorial Affairs, which remained the designation until 1980, when an Office of Assistant Secretary for Territorial and International Affairs was created. (The designation &quot;international&quot; refers to what became the freely associated states of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau.)

Today, the Interior Department, through the Office of Insular Affairs, continues to be responsible for the outlying insular areas including American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

<text>Guadalupe Robledo (December 12, 1934 – November 6, 2018) was a Mexican professional wrestler, best known by the ring name of José Lothario. He performed for such promotions as the NWA and the WWF.

== Professional wrestling career ==
Lothario started his career in the early ’50s in Mexico where he was an accomplished boxer and wrestler. Having already earned success there as a luchador, Lothario was an established commodity when he moved to the US in 1957, working in the Carolinas under the name Joe Garcia. He later made his way into the Gulf Coast territory as “El Gran” Lothario, a nickname that stuck throughout his career.
Playing off his strong background in boxing, Lothario would hold a number of brass knucks titles in various territories, with rugged taped fists bouts becoming one of his specialties.
Dusty Rhodes, who began his career in Texas while Lothario was a headliner, called him the greatest Latin American wrestler and babyface in the world and one of his top five performers of all time.

Lothario competed in the National Wrestling Alliance for most of his career. He once had a winning streak of over 50 matches. On Christmas Day 1970, Lothario teamed up with Danny Miller to defeat The Infernos and win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. In storyline, the previous champions, Dusty Rhodes and Dick Murdoch, had been stripped of the title. Lothario&#x27;s biggest feuds were with Gino Hernandez, whom he defeated in a hair match in November 1978, and El Gran Marcus. Teaming with the legendary Mil Mascaras, Lothario drew massive crowds in Houston and San Antonio against the heel duo of Black Gordman and Great Goliath. He was also a mainstay in Florida and Texas.

In Florida Lothario shared the Southern tag-team title with Don Curtis, Dory Funk Jr. and Joe Scarpa (aka Chief Jay Strongbow) on three occasions. He held the Florida tag-team belts with Argentina Apollo and Danny Miller. He held the Florida version of the NWA world tag-team title four times — twice with Wahoo McDaniel and once with Eddie Graham and Sam Steamboat. Lothario enjoyed greater success in Texas where he held several major tag titles. He shared the American tag-team belts on three occasions with El Halcon, and also had runs with Mil Mascaras, Tiger Conway Jr. and Ivan Putski. He held the Texas tag-team title six times, with Mil Mascaras, Rocky Johnson, Ivan Putski, Cien Caras and twice with Alberto Madril. Lothario also was a top singles performer in the Lone Star State, holding the Texas heavyweight crown on seven occasions, the Texas brass knucks crown five times, and the World Class Championship Wrestling TV title twice.

Lothario trained Shawn Michaels in the 1980s, with Lothario later becoming Michaels&#x27; manager in the WWF in 1996, managing Michaels to winning his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XII. At the In Your House 10: Mind Games pay per view in September 1996, Lothario squashed Jim Cornette. He continued to manage Michaels until Royal Rumble in January 1997. He briefly returned to WWF in January 1999 as part of a storyline involving Michaels. Lothario&#x27;s son Pete was also a professional wrestler in the Texas area. His wife, Jean Lothario, also wrestled with Joe Blanchard&#x27;s Southwest Wrestling Alliance.They have a daughter, Gina.

==Death==
Lothario died on November 6, 2018, from natural causes at the age of 83.

<doc id="706106" wikidata="Q841249" url="?curid=706106" title="Electrostatic induction">
<text>Electrostatic induction, also known as &quot;electrostatic influence&quot; or simply &quot;influence&quot; in Europe and Latin America, is a redistribution of electric charge in an object that is caused by the influence of nearby charges. In the presence of a charged body, an insulated conductor develops a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. Induction was discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762. Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle. See also Stephen Gray in this context. Due to induction, the electrostatic potential (voltage) is constant at any point throughout a conductor. Electrostatic induction is also responsible for the attraction of light nonconductive objects, such as balloons, paper or styrofoam scraps, to static electric charges. Electrostatic induction laws apply in dynamic situations as far as the quasistatic approximation is valid.

== Explanation ==
A normal uncharged piece of matter has equal numbers of positive and negative electric charges in each part of it, located close together, so no part of it has a net electric charge. The positive charges are the atoms&#x27; nuclei which are bound into the structure of matter and are not free to move. The negative charges are the atoms&#x27; electrons. In electrically conductive objects such as metals, some of the electrons are able to move freely about in the object.

When a charged object is brought near an uncharged, electrically conducting object, such as a piece of metal, the force of the nearby charge due to Coulomb&#x27;s law causes a separation of these internal charges. For example, if a positive charge is brought near the object (see picture of cylindrical electrode near electrostatic machine), the electrons in the metal will be attracted toward it and move to the side of the object facing it. When the electrons move out of an area, they leave an unbalanced positive charge due to the nuclei. This results in a region of negative charge on the object nearest to the external charge, and a region of positive charge on the part away from it. These are called &quot;induced charges&quot;. If the external charge is negative, the polarity of the charged regions will be reversed.

Since this process is just a redistribution of the charges that were already in the object, it doesn&#x27;t change the &quot;total&quot; charge on the object; it still has no net charge. This induction effect is reversible; if the nearby charge is removed, the attraction between the positive and negative internal charges causes them to intermingle again.

== Charging an object by induction ==

However, the induction effect can also be used to put a net charge on an object. If, while it is close to the positive charge, the above object is momentarily connected through a conductive path to electrical ground, which is a large reservoir of both positive and negative charges, some of the negative charges in the ground will flow into the object, under the attraction of the nearby positive charge. When the contact with ground is broken, the object is left with a net negative charge.

This method can be demonstrated using a gold-leaf electroscope, which is an instrument for detecting electric charge. The electroscope is first discharged, and a charged object is then brought close to the instrument&#x27;s top terminal. Induction causes a separation of the charges inside the electroscope&#x27;s metal rod, so that the top terminal gains a net charge of opposite polarity to that of the object, while the gold leaves gain a charge of the same polarity. Since both leaves have the same charge, they repel each other and spread apart. The electroscope has not acquired a net charge: the charge within it has merely been redistributed, so if the charged object were to be moved away from the electroscope the leaves will come together again.

But if an electrical contact is now briefly made between the electroscope terminal and ground, for example by touching the terminal with a finger, this causes charge to flow from ground to the terminal, attracted by the charge on the object close to the terminal. This charge neutralizes the charge in the gold leaves, so the leaves come together again. The electroscope now contains a net charge opposite in polarity to that of the charged object. When the electrical contact to earth is broken, e.g. by lifting the finger, the extra charge that has just flowed into the electroscope cannot escape, and the instrument retains a net charge. The charge is held in the top of the electroscope terminal by the attraction of the inducing charge. But when the inducing charge is moved away, the charge is released and spreads throughout the electroscope terminal to the leaves, so the gold leaves move apart again.

The sign of the charge left on the electroscope after grounding is always opposite in sign to the external inducing charge. The two rules of induction are:
*If the object is not grounded, the nearby charge will induce &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;opposite&quot; charges in the object.
*If &quot;any part&quot; of the object is momentarily grounded while the inducing charge is near, a charge opposite in polarity to the inducing charge will be attracted from ground into the object, and it will be left with a charge &quot;opposite&quot; to the inducing charge.
==The electrostatic field inside a conductive object is zero==
A remaining question is how large the induced charges are. The movement of charges is caused by the force exerted on them by the electric field of the external charged object, by Coulomb&#x27;s law. As the charges in the metal object continue to separate, the resulting positive and negative regions create their own electric field, which opposes the field of the external charge. This process continues until very quickly (within a fraction of a second) an equilibrium is reached in which the induced charges are exactly the right size and shape to cancel the external electric field throughout the interior of the metal object. Then the remaining mobile charges (electrons) in the interior of the metal no longer feel a force and the net motion of the charges stops.

==Induced charge resides on the surface==
Since the mobile charges (electrons) in the interior of a metal object are free to move in any direction, there can never be a static concentration of charge inside the metal; if there was, it would disperse due to its mutual repulsion. Therefore in induction, the mobile charges move through the metal under the influence of the external charge in such a way that they maintain local electrostatic neutrality; in any interior region the negative charge of the electrons balances the positive charge of the nuclei. The electrons move until they reach the surface of the metal and collect there, where they are constrained from moving by the boundary. The surface is the only location where a net electric charge can exist.

This establishes the principle that electrostatic charges on conductive objects reside on the surface of the object. External electric fields induce surface charges on metal objects that exactly cancel the field within.

==The voltage throughout a conductive object is constant==
The electrostatic potential or voltage between two points is defined as the energy (work) required to move a small positive charge through an electric field between the two points, divided by the size of the charge. If there is an electric field directed from point formula_1 to point formula_2 then it will exert a force on a charge moving from formula_2 to formula_1. Work will have to be done on the charge by a force to make it move to formula_1 against the opposing force of the electric field. Thus the electrostatic potential energy of the charge will increase. So the potential at point formula_1 is higher than at point formula_2. The electric field formula_8 at any point formula_9 is the gradient (rate of change) of the electrostatic potential formula_10 : 
:formula_11
Since there can be no electric field inside a conductive object to exert force on charges formula_12, within a conductive object the gradient of the potential is zero 
:formula_13
Another way of saying this is that in electrostatics, electrostatic induction ensures that the potential (voltage) throughout a conductive object is constant.

== Induction in dielectric objects ==

A similar induction effect occurs in nonconductive (dielectric) objects, and is responsible for the attraction of small light nonconductive objects, like balloons, scraps of paper or Styrofoam, to static electric charges &quot;(see picture of cat, above)&quot;, as well as static cling in clothes.

In nonconductors, the electrons are bound to atoms or molecules and are not free to move about the object as in conductors; however they can move a little within the molecules. If a positive charge is brought near a nonconductive object, the electrons in each molecule are attracted toward it, and move to the side of the molecule facing the charge, while the positive nuclei are repelled and move slightly to the opposite side of the molecule. Since the negative charges are now closer to the external charge than the positive charges, their attraction is greater than the repulsion of the positive charges, resulting in a small net attraction of the molecule toward the charge. This effect is microscopic, but since there are so many molecules, it adds up to enough force to move a light object like Styrofoam.

This change in the distribution of charge in a molecule due to an external electric field is called dielectric polarization, and the polarized molecules are called dipoles. This should not be confused with a polar molecule, which has a positive and negative end due to its structure, even in the absence of external charge. This is the principle of operation of a pith-ball electroscope.

<text>The National Observer was a weekly American general-interest national newspaper published by Dow Jones &amp; Company from 1962 until July 11, 1977. Hunter S. Thompson wrote several articles for the &quot;National Observer&quot; as the correspondent for Latin America early in his career.

The newspaper was the inspiration of Barney Kilgore, then the president of Dow Jones. (Kilgore is credited as the &quot;genius&quot; who transformed the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; from a provincial financial daily with a circulation of 32,000, mostly on Wall Street, into the national giant it became.)

It was Kilgore&#x27;s idea that the nation needed a weekly national newspaper that would synthesize all the week&#x27;s events and current trends into an attractive, convenient package. In effect, the &quot;National Observer &quot;would offer the kind of quality non-financial journalism that the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; once featured in its front-page &quot;leaders&quot; (the articles that occupy the left- and right-hand columns).

<doc id="706127" wikidata="Q317578" url="?curid=706127" title="Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia">
<text>Alexander Karađorđević (; 11 October 1806 – 3 May 1885) was the prince of Serbia between 1842 and 1858 and a member of the House of Karađorđević.

==Early life==
The youngest son of Karađorđe Petrović and his wife, Jelena Jovanović (1764–1842), was born in Topola on 11 October 1806. He was educated in Khotyn, Bessarabia, under the patronage of the Russian Tsar.

After the Sultan’s decree acknowledging the title of Prince Mihailo Obrenović at the end of 1839, the family returned to Serbia. Alexander joined the Headquarters of the Serbian Army, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and appointed as adjutant to Prince Mihailo.

==Prince of Serbia==
After the political conflicts caused by disrespect of the so-called &quot;Turkish constitution,&quot; and Miloš Obrenović&#x27;s and then Mihailo Obrenović&#x27;s abdications, Aleksandar Karađorđević was elected the Prince of Serbia at the National Assembly in Vračar, a municipality in modern Belgrade, on 14 September 1842. Having had his title acknowledged by Russia and Turkey, Prince Aleksandar started the reforms and founded a number of new institutions in order to improve the progress of the Serbian state. He implemented the code of civil rights, introduced the regular Army, built a cannon foundry, improved the existing schools and founded new ones, as well as established the National Library and National Museum.

It was Councillor Lazar Arsenijević Batalaka who, in 1845 introduced Ilija Garašanin to Prince Aleksandar.

During the Hungarian Revolution in Vojvodina, in 1848, Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević sent Serbian volunteers under the command of Stevan Knićanin to help the Serbs’ struggle for autonomy. As a follow-up of the national-political movements of 1848, the pan-slavistic idea of a Yugoslav Monarchy emerged. The &quot;Načertanije&quot; (the &quot;Draft&quot;) document, written as a Serbian political program by Ilija Garašanin four years earlier, made the mission of replacing the Austrian and Turkish domination of all Southern Slavs with the Serbian rule under the banner of &quot;Serbia.&quot;

Throughout his reign, Prince Alexander was troubled with Obrenović plots. By his refusal to take part in the Crimean War as an ally of the French, British and Ottoman Empires against the Russian Empire. The result was his overthrow and departure into exile in 1858 by the winners of the Powers in the war and bringing the rival Obrenović dynasty to the throne of the Principality of Serbia.

He was awarded the Ottoman Order of Glory and Order of Distinction.

===Abdication===
The popularity of the pro-Austrian Prince Alexander Karađorđević, declined dramatically after the Treaty of Paris left Serbia with no concessions at the end of the Crimean War. The Assembly voted upon his deposition on December 23, 1858, and Miloš Obrenović, who had previously been Prince of Serbia was recalled. In contrast to the pro-Austrian policies of his predecessor, Obrenović stood firm against both Turkey and Austria. He managed to pressure the Assembly to grant the House of Obrenović succession to the Serbian throne.

Prince Alexander died in Timișoara on 3 May 1885. He was buried in Vienna, and his earthly remains were moved in 1912 to the Memorial Church of St. George built by his son Petar I Karađorđević, in Oplenac, Serbia.

== Marriage and issue ==

On 1 June 1830 in Hotin, Bessarabia, he married Persida Nenadović (15 February 1813 – 29 March 1873), member of the powerful Nenadović family, daughter of Voivode Jevrem Nenadović (1793–1867) and Jovanka Milovanović (1792–1880). They had ten children:

* Princess Poleksija (1 February 1833 – 5 December 1914), married firstly in 1849 Konstantin Nikolajević (1821 – suicide 13 October 1877), Minister of the Interior of Serbia, by whom she had issue; secondly Dr Alexander Preshern (1830 – 2 December 1914).
* Princess Kleopatra (26 November 1835 – 13 July 1855), married in 1855 Milan Avram Petronijević, Serbian Ambassador to Russia.
* Prince Aleksij (23 March 1836 – 21 April 1841)
* Prince Svetozar (1841 – 17 March 1847)
* Prince Peter (29 June 1844 – 16 August 1921), ruled Serbia from 1903 until 1918, and subsequently as King of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes until his death; married Princess Zorka of Montenegro, by whom he had issue.
* Princess Jelena (18 October 1846 – 26 July 1867), married in 1867 Đorđe Simić (28 February 1843 – 11 October 1921), Prime Minister of Serbia.
* Prince Andrej (15 September 1848 – 12 July 1864)
* Princess Jelisaveta (born and died 1850)
* Prince Đorđe (11 October 1856 – 5 January 1889)
* Prince Arsenije (16 April 1859 – 1938), married in 1892, Princess Aurora of San Donato. They were the parents of Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia.

<text>The electroscope is an early scientific instrument used to detect the presence of electric charge on a body. It detects this by the movement of a test charge due to the Coulomb electrostatic force on it. The amount of charge on an object is proportional to its voltage. The accumulation of enough charge to detect with an electroscope requires hundreds or thousands of volts, so electroscopes are used with high voltage sources such as static electricity and electrostatic machines. An electroscope can only give a rough indication of the quantity of charge; an instrument that measures electric charge quantitatively is called an electrometer.

The electroscope was the first electrical measuring instrument. The first electroscope was a pivoted needle (called the &quot;versorium&quot;), invented by British physician William Gilbert around 1600. The pith-ball electroscope and the gold-leaf electroscope are two classical types of electroscope that are still used in physics education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics. A type of electroscope is also used in the quartz fiber radiation dosimeter. Electroscopes were used by the Austrian scientist
Victor Hess in the discovery of cosmic rays.

== Pith-ball electroscope ==

In 1731, Stephen Gray used a simple hanging thread, which would be attracted to any nearby charged object. This was the first improvement on Gilbert&#x27;s versorium from 1600.

The pith-ball electroscope, invented by British schoolmaster and physicist John Canton in 1754, consists of one or two small balls of a lightweight nonconductive substance, originally a spongy plant material called pith, suspended by silk or linen thread from the hook of an insulated stand. Tiberius Cavallo made an electroscope in 1770 with pith balls at the end of silver wires. Modern electroscopes usually use balls made of plastic. In order to test the presence of a charge on an object, the object is brought near to the uncharged pith ball. If the object is charged, the ball will be attracted to it and move toward it.

The attraction occurs because of induced polarization of the atoms inside the pith ball. All matter consists of electrically charged particles located close together; each atom consists of a positively charged nucleus with a cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding it. The pith is an insulator, so the electrons in the ball are bound to atoms of the pith and are not free to leave the atoms and move about in the ball, but they can move a little within the atoms. See diagram. If, for example, a positively charged object &quot;(B)&quot; is brought near the pith ball &quot;(A)&quot;, the negative electrons &quot;(blue minus signs)&quot; in each atom &quot;&quot; will be attracted and move slightly toward the side of the atom nearer the object. The positively charged nuclei &quot;(red plus signs)&quot; will be repelled and will move slightly away. Since the negative charges in the pith ball are now nearer to the object than the positive charges &quot;(C)&quot;, their attraction is greater than the repulsion of the positive charges, resulting in a net attractive force. This separation of charge is microscopic, but since there are so many atoms, the tiny forces add up to a large enough force to move a light pith ball.

The pith ball can be charged by touching it to a charged object, so some of the charges on the surface of the charged object move to the surface of the ball. Then the ball can be used to distinguish the polarity of charge on other objects because it will be repelled by objects charged with the same polarity or sign it has, but attracted to charges of the opposite polarity.

Often the electroscope will have a pair of suspended pith balls. This allows one to tell at a glance whether the pith balls are charged. If one of the pith balls is touched to a charged object, charging it, the second one will be attracted and touch it, communicating some of the charge to the surface of the second ball. Now both balls have the same polarity charge, so they repel each other. They hang in an inverted &#x27;V&#x27; shape with the balls spread apart. The distance between the balls will give a rough idea of the magnitude of the charge.

== Gold-leaf electroscope ==
The gold-leaf electroscope was developed in 1787 by British clergyman and physicist Abraham Bennet, as a more sensitive instrument than pith ball or straw blade electroscopes then in use. It consists of a vertical metal rod, usually brass, from the end of which hang two parallel strips of thin flexible gold leaf. A disk or ball terminal is attached to the top of the rod, where the charge to be tested is applied. To protect the gold leaves from drafts of air they are enclosed in a glass bottle, usually open at the bottom and mounted over a conductive base. Often there are grounded metal plates or foil strips in the bottle flanking the gold leaves on either side. These are a safety measure; if an excessive charge is applied to the delicate gold leaves, they will touch the grounding plates and discharge before tearing. They also capture charge leaking through the air that accumulates on the glass walls, increasing the sensitivity of the instrument. In the precision instruments the inside of the bottle was occasionally evacuated, to prevent the charge on the terminal from leaking off through the ionization of the air.

When the metal terminal is touched with a charged object, the gold leaves spread apart in an inverted &#x27;V&#x27;. This is because some of the charge from the object is conducted through the terminal and metal rod to the leaves. Since the leaves receive the same sign charge they repel each other and thus diverge. If the terminal is grounded by touching it with a finger, the charge is transferred through the human body into the earth and the gold leaves close together.

The electroscope leaves can also be charged without touching a charged object to the terminal, by electrostatic induction. As the charged object is brought near the electroscope terminal, the leaves spread apart, because the electric field from the object induces a charge in the conductive electroscope rod and leaves, and the charged leaves repel each other. The opposite-sign charge is attracted to the nearby object and collects on the terminal disk, while the same-sign charge is repelled from the object and collects on the leaves (but only as much as left the terminal), so the leaves repel each other. If the electroscope is grounded while the charged object is nearby, by touching it momentarily with a finger, the repelled same-sign charges travel through the contact to ground, leaving the electroscope with a net charge having the opposite sign as the object. The leaves initially hang down free because the net charge is concentrated at the terminal end. When the charged object is moved away, the charge at the terminal spreads into the leaves, causing them to spread apart again.

===Europe===
In late 2006, the C30 was launched in Europe. Engines choices range from a 1.6L inline-4 (petrol or diesel) to a 2.5L inline-5 turbo (2.4L diesel). 2009 added the choices of a 6-speed PowerShift dual-clutch automatic with the 2.0 L petrol and diesel engines, a 1.8L E85 flex-fuel engine, and 1.6L &quot;DRIVe&quot; diesel engines with improved efficiency and optional start/stop capability.

Trim lines include SE and SE Lux in the UK, and Kinetic, Momentum, and Summum (from fewest to most features) in most other European nations. The R-Design package adds interior and exterior accessories including aluminum inlays on the dashboard, R-Design emblems on the steering wheel, seats and floor mats, a rear spoiler and body kit.

===North America===
The C30 went on sale in Canada in March 2007 as a 2007 model, and in October 2007 in the United States as a 2008 model.

In Canada, the 2.4i was offered until 2011, while the T5 remained available until the end of production. In the United States, the only engine available was the T5. For 2008, the US C30 debuted with two trim lines, Version 1.0 and Version 2.0. R-Design was added later in the model year, featuring unique badges and interior trim. From 2009 onwards, the US C30 was offered in T5 or R-Design trim. In 2011, the Polestar performance option (developed in partnership between Volvo Car Corporation and Polestar) became available for several Volvo models, including 2008 to 2013 C30 T5 models. The software modification to the engine control computer increased output from to without a reduction in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy ratings.

===Equipment===
Available audio systems included:
*Performance – with a 4x20W amplifier and six loudspeakers
*High Performance – with a 4x40W amplifier and eight loudspeakers
*Premium Sound – with a digital class D amplifier with ICE Power technology from Alpine, an output of 5x130W, Dolby Pro Logic II Surround, and ten loudspeakers from Danish Dynaudio
On the High Performance and Premium Sound, it is possible to play CDs with music in MP3 and WMA formats, and they are fitted with an extra AUX connector for connecting auxiliary equipment such as a portable MP3 player. Starting in the spring of 2007, an adapter for connecting an iPod or a USB flash drive will also be available as an accessory.

The 2008 model year brings some minor changes, mostly adapting the interior to the facelifted S40/V50 and including as standard an Aux audio socket.

The 2009 model year moved the Volvo badge from the hatch handle to the glass area above it, enlarged the font and increased the space between the letters. It also brought other small changes such as including the hard load cover as standard.

===Engines and transmissions===
===Safety===
The C30 continues Volvo&#x27;s marketing strategy to put safety as a primary concern (IntelliSafe). This is demonstrated through some recently developed safety features, including a method of overcoming the &quot;blind spots&quot; in the driver&#x27;s view to the rear through a system known as BLIS (Blind Spot Information System).

The C30 also features a four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), traction control system and front, side and curtain airbags, front and rear crumple zones, and a stiff occupant cell.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Volvo C30 their Top Safety Pick award. The C30 was granted its highest rating of &quot;good&quot; in front, side, rear and roof strength tests and has Electronic Stability Control as standard equipment to receive the award.

The Volvo C30 has a patented front and rear structure using four different grades of steel to absorb and redistribute impact energy around the body of the coupe. Volvo&#x27;s Whiplash Protection System and Side Impact Protection System with side airbags and Inflatable Curtain are also standard. The seat belts have pretensioners to protect the occupants against unexpected accidents.

The car also uses Volvo&#x27;s Intelligent Driver Information System (IDIS) which continuously monitors the car&#x27;s preemptive systems such as steering wheel angle, pedal depressions, and overall factors that help the vehicle&#x27;s computer to decide if the driver is busy or distracted merging or turning, and will then accordingly delay certain data or alerts that are unimportant.

The C30 has been criticized because in an effort to make it more responsive in curves it has become less reliable on ice or snow where the rear end can more easily lose its grip compared to other Volvo models.

===2010 update===

In spring 2009, Volvo C30 1.6D DRIVe is available with an advanced start/stop function (as 1.6D DRIVe start/stop).

The updated vehicles were unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.

The updated C30 went on sale in early 2010, as a 2011 model in North America and Australia. Early models include T5 (2.5 litres), 2.4i, 2.0, 2.0F (Flexifuel), 1.6, D5 (2.4 litres), 2.0D, 1.6D DRIVe, 1.6D DRIVe start/stop. Delivery began in early 2010.

===Range Extenders concepts (2011)===
Volvo C30 with series-connected Range Extender is based on C30 Electric with a three-cylinder combustion engine producing installed under the rear load compartment floor. The car also has a 40-litre fuel tank. The combustion engine is connected to a 40 kW generator. The combined power is used to drive the car&#x27;s electric motor, but the driver can also choose to let the generator charge the battery, thus increasing the car&#x27;s operating range on electricity. This Range Extender increases the electric car&#x27;s range by up to 1,000 km – on top of the 110 km range provided by the car&#x27;s battery pack.

Volvo C30 with parallel-connected Range Extender includes a turbocharged three-cylinder combustion engine rated at at the rear and a 40-litre fuel tank, six-speed automatic transmission. 40 kW generator the battery can also be charged to give the car increased range on electricity alone. The electric motor is same as series-connected Range Extender car. The combined power is rated . This Range Extender increases the electric car&#x27;s range by up to 1,000 km – on top of the 75 km range provided by the car&#x27;s battery pack.

Production of fuel cells began in 2010.

==C30 DRIVe Electric (2011–2013)==
The Volvo C30 Electric was a limited-production battery electric car produced in the mid-2010s.

The prototype C30 electric car used an 82 kW electric motor, and had a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack installed in the propshaft tunnel and in the space normally occupied by the fuel tank, outside the passenger compartment and away from the deformations zones. The C30 electric delivers up to under the NEDC cycle.

A drivable C30 prototype was presented in September 2009. An updated prototype (with complete interior and full instrumentation, and enhanced battery packaging) was unveiled in the 2010 North American International Auto Show.

The C30 DRIVe Electric concept car was exhibited in the 2010 Paris Motor Show and presented as the C30 DRIVe.

Field testing of about 50 C30 electric cars was conducted in Sweden beginning the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly internally at the Volvo Car Corporation. A Volvo C30 Electric was also part of the One Tonne Life project in which a family was given the task of living as climate-smart as possible for a period of six months. In July 2012 Volvo delivered 15 Volvo C30 electric cars as part of an open road test-drive project in Shanghai.

The electric C30 has a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery, supplied by US manufacturer EnerDel. The electric motor, the motor controller, the charger and other drivetrain components were supplied by Swiss manufacturer BRUSA Elektronik AG. Top speed was estimated by Volvo to be , with acceleration from 0–50 km/h (0–31 mph) in 4 seconds. The C30 Electric can be recharged from a regular household power socket and a full charge takes about 7 hours. The all-electric range is up to . The batteries are installed where the fuel tank normally sits and also in a special compartment in the C30&#x27;s central tunnel, and as a result, the luggage compartment is unchanged. In August 2012 Volvo ordered a second supply of battery packs from EnerDel to build an internal test fleet together with Siemens.
The Volvo C30 Electric is equipped with three climate systems: one supplies the passengers with heating or cooling; one cools or warms the battery pack as necessary; and the electric motor and power electronics are water-cooled. The climate control in the passenger cabin features a bioethanol-powered heater, a solution chosen by Volvo to get heating without compromising the battery driving range, but the driver has the option to run the climate unit on electricity from the batteries. Ethanol is the default mode and the ethanol tank can carry of bio-ethanol. Volvo tested the C30 in winter conditions in temperatures as low as −20 °C (−4 °F) in 2011.

===Awards===
The C30 DRIVe was one of the five finalists to the 2011 Green Car Vision Award. In July 2012, the Volvo C30 electric was named the &quot;Green Car of the Year&quot; in China at the 4th China New Energy Mobility Summit.

===Production===
The Volvo C30 Electric body was built on the regular assembly line in the Ghent, Belgium factory, and then the glider is transported to Gothenburg for installation of the motor, batteries and other C30 Electric-specific assemblies.

As a low production car, Volvo intended to lease the Volvo C30 Electric only to corporate customers, mainly companies, authorities and government agencies. Initial deliveries were scheduled for the third quarter of 2011 throughout Europe, including in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. Volvo planned to build about 250 cars by the end of 2012, and possibly more if market interest occasioned. Volvo also planned to allocate a total of 100 Volvo C30 Electrics for the US, half of which would be offered on the West Coast and the other half on the East Coast. Volvo targeted the leases to corporate and government fleet users at a price of around per month in the U.S. and per month in Europe on a three-year lease. As this pricing was much higher than other electric cars available in the market by 2011, demand was expected to be low, and Volvo explained that their prices reflect the actual cost of the limited-production car. During 2011, 6 units were registered in France. A total of 126 units have been leased in Sweden through September 2012 since 2011. As of July 5, 2013, the C30 was no longer available to order from Volvo, nor did it remain the model line up on the Volvo Cars website. The last C30&#x27;s from current stock were intended to be registered by the end of 2013, but none were produced after July 2013.

Production of the C30 Electric began in June 2011. Delivery of first ten C30 Electric went to the energy company Göteborg Energi with deliveries starting at the autumn of 2010. Leasing to fleet customers in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway began in the third quarter of 2011. A total of 209 units have been leased in Europe through October 2012, Sweden is the top selling market with 149 units delivered since 2011 through March 2013.

Production ceased in December 2012 and the C30 line was discontinued in 2013.

===Marketing===
In the &#x27;DRIVe Around the World&#x27; C30 DRIVe campaign, a Facebook game was created to challenge users to virtually drive a Volvo C30 DRIVe to a Facebook friend who lives as close to 1,333 kilometres away from Sweden to Egypt as possible. The challenge began in 2009-11-16 and ended in 2010-02-05. The game was promoted with an animated trailer, which received 569,000 views worldwide in 169 countries. The Volvo fan page (www.facebook.com/volvo) was rewarded by a donation from Volvo Cars of 15,000 EURO in the Volvo Fans&#x27; team name to a Gold Standard certified wind farm project in Izmir, Turkey.

In the One Tonne Life project, the Lindell family lived in a temporary home from A-hus and drove Volvo C30 Electric. The project house was designed by architect Gert Wingårdh.

==Motorsport==
Volvo Polestar driver Robert Dahlgren won the 2010 Scandinavian Touring Car Championship. In addition, after 8 of 9 rounds of STCC Driver&#x27;s Championship 2010, Robert Dahlgren lead the tournament, and Volvo Polestar placed 2nd in the team championship.

Robert Dahlgren won the 2010 STCC Driver&#x27;s Championship, while Volvo Polestar won the 2010 STCC Team Championship.

In the 2011 World Touring Car Championship season, the Polestar Racing team used Volvo C30 DRIVe as their race car.

Volvo C30 Electric shared first place in the 130-kilometre Michelin Challenge Bibendum rally plus awards for handling, well to wheel CO2 emissions and local emissions.

Polestar Racing entered 2011 WTCC season with one Volvo C30 DRIVe racer driven by Robert Dahlgren.

In 2011 World Touring Car Championship, Robert Dahlgren crashed out of qualifying in Macau race, ending the Polestar Racing team&#x27;s season career.

The C30 won 5 races during the 2011 Pirelli World Challenge season.

===STCC-Volvo (2010)===
It is a race car version of C30 designed for the 2010 Swedish Touring Car Championship.

==Marketing==
As part of the European C30 launch, a series of 16 different television commercials were created by Fuel London (part of Euro RSCG Worldwide) under the campaign&#x27;s theme, &quot;A Product of Free Will.&quot;

As part of the US C30 launch, Volvo C30&#x27;s configuration site featured a fluctuating price quote for the identically equipped vehicles. Volvo&#x27;s intention was to determine what potential buyers are willing to pay and how many vehicles they should ship to the States.

In Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s popular &quot;Twilight&quot; novel series, it is suggested that Edward drives a &quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;silver&quot; Volvo S60-R, a fast sleeper car that doesn&#x27;t call attention to the Cullen family&#x27;s wealth. The film series partnered with Volvo to place a Volvo C30 in the 2008 &quot;Twilight&quot; film, feeling that the C30 better suited the persona of a 108 year old vampire pretending to be a 17-year-old high school student. Volvo reported an increase in the sale of the C30 in the US market following the film&#x27;s release, and helped change the perception of Volvo as a &quot;cool&quot; car in a younger generation of buyers.

<doc id="706138" wikidata="Q973330" url="?curid=706138" title="Steve LaTourette">
<text>Steven Clare LaTourette (July 22, 1954 – August 3, 2016) was an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for and then from 1995 to 2013. He was a member of the Republican Party. On July 30, 2012, it was reported that he would retire at the end of his term and not seek re-election. He subsequently co-founded a lobbying firm.

==Early life, education and career==
LaTourette was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Patricia Munn and Eugene LaTourette, an accountant. The LaTourette family were French Huguenots who fled persecution in the 1600s and first settled in Staten Island, New York.

A graduate of Cleveland Heights High School (1972) and the University of Michigan, LaTourette studied law at the Cleveland State University College of Law.

After a stint as a public defender, LaTourette was elected the County Prosecutor of Lake County, Ohio, and served from 1989 to 1995. There, he made his name prosecuting the Kirtland mass murders that were organized by mass-murderer and self-proclaimed prophet, Jeffrey Lundgren.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Appropriations
** Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on Legislative Branch
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (vice chair)

LaTourette was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. In 2006, LaTourette co-authored the Financial Data Protection Act of 2006, which sought to unify state and federal laws on banking and privacy and ease the burden of patchwork legislation.

===Positions===
In 1997, LaTourette sponsored H.R. 1151, a law that among other things exempted credit unions chartered for the purpose of making, or had a history of primarily making, member business loans, from certain regulatory restrictions. The effect of the deregulatory change was to increase risky lending to taxi companies, helping temporarily drive up the price of taxi licenses before eventually resulting in large credit union losses and hundreds of bankruptcies.

LaTourette had voted to impeach Bill Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal while he himself was having a long-term affair with his chief of staff, Jennifer Laptook.

On Thursday, March 17, 2011, LaTourette became one of only seven Republicans who voted &quot;NO&quot; on a measure introduced in the US House of Representatives to strip all government funding from NPR.

In a meeting with transit advocates, LaTourette disparaged fellow legislators, referring to them as &quot;knuckledraggers that came in during the last election that hate taxes&quot; and are reluctant even to consider raising revenues as part of a compromise to extend the debt ceiling.

On June 28, 2012, LaTourette was one of only two Republicans (along with Scott Rigell of Virginia) who voted against a motion to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal contempt of Congress, though he did vote to bring civil charges against Holder for his handling of the Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.

==Political campaigns==

===1994===
LaTourette was elected to the House in 1994 in the wave of Republican successes in that year, defeating incumbent Eric Fingerhut. LaTourette served the 19th district of Ohio from 1995 to 2003. After another district was eliminated in the round of redistricting following the 2000 Census, LaTourette&#x27;s district was renumbered to the 14th district of Ohio, where he represented the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, northeastern Summit County, northern Trumbull County, northern Portage County, Ashtabula County, Lake County, and Geauga County.

===2008===
===2010===

LaTourette defeated Democratic nominee and former Appellate Court judge Bill O&#x27;Neill in the general election, along with Libertarian nominee and accountant John Jelenic.

===2012===
On July 30, 2012, it was reported that LaTourette would retire at the end of his term and not seek re-election.

==Electoral history==


Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2002, Sid Stone received 113 votes.
==Post-congressional career==
LaTourette established a Super PAC, Defending Main Street. The PAC was created to curb the influence of the Tea Party movement in the Republican Party.

Despite his previous opposition to same-sex marriage, in 2015, LaTourette signed a Supreme Court brief to support the overturn of state bans on the practice.

==Illness and death==
In mid-2014 LaTourette discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. Consequently, he filed a claim in May 2015 against the Office of the Attending Physician of the United States Congress citing a lack of information in that regard when he was observed earlier. LaTourette died on August 3, 2016, from pancreatic cancer, aged 62.

<text>Georgy Apollonovich Gapon ( –) was a Russian Orthodox priest of Ukrainian descent and a popular working-class leader before the 1905 Russian Revolution. Father Gapon is mainly remembered as the leader of peaceful crowds of protesters on Bloody Sunday, when hundreds of them were killed by firing squads of the Imperial Russian Army.

==Early life==
Georgy Apollonovich Gapon was born , in the village of Bilyky, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). He was the oldest son of a Cossack father and mother who hailed from the local peasantry. Gapon&#x27;s father, Apollon Fedorovich Gapon, had some formal education and served as an elected village elder and clerk in Bilyky. His mother was illiterate and religiously devout and actively raised her son in the norms and traditions of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Gapon was an excellent primary school student and was offered a place at the Lower Ecclesiastical School in Poltava, a seminary that offered Gapon the best prospect for advancing his formal education. In his final year at this school, Gapon was first exposed to the radical philosophical teachings of Leo Tolstoy through one of his instructors, a devoted follower of the Russian writer. This instructor, I. M. Tregubov, regarded Gapon as one of the top students at the school, serious and intelligent in demeanour and diligent and curious in his studies.

Following his graduation from the Lower Ecclesiastical School, Gapon was admitted to , where he continued to be guided in his study of Tolstoy&#x27;s ideas by other local followers. Gapon was influenced by the Tolstoyan emphasis on working with the poor and with its philosophical criticism with the formalistic and hierarchical practices of the official church. This brought him into conflict with certain seminary officials, who threatened to rescind his educational stipend. Gapon met this threat by himself rejecting further aid and seeking to pay for his own education through work as a private tutor.

Gapon fell ill from typhus, which incapacitated him for a time, making it impossible to earn a living as a tutor and continue his studies effectively. He decided to abandon plans for a career as a priest, seeking instead to attend Tomsk University to become a physician, so as to be of greater service to the ailing poor. His plans were short-circuited, however, when the seminary issued him a less-than-perfect grade for behaviour, thereby effectively barring his path to further university education.

At the age of 23 Gapon took a job in Poltava as a &quot;zemstvo&quot; statistician, supplementing his income with money earned working as a private tutor. It was in this capacity that he met the daughter of a local merchant in a house in which he was giving private lessons. The family objected to a proposed marriage due to Gapon&#x27;s limited employment horizons, however, and as a means of overcoming this obstacle he again sought to become a priest. He made an appeal to Bishop of Poltava, apologizing for past behaviour and promising to fulfill expectations of the church in the future. The bishop was moved by the appeal and interceded with the family, winning the couple permission to marry.

Gapon was placed on the fast track to priesthood, occupying a place as a church psalm reader for a year, followed by a &quot;pro forma&quot; promotion to deacon for just one day before being made priest of the Poltava cemetery church. Gapon&#x27;s services were innovative and informal, and his church rapidly grew in size, negatively impacting other more formalistic local churches, whose priests lodged complaints against him. Nevertheless, Gapon continued to enjoy the support of the bishop in his position and was largely satisfied with his station in life.

==Move to St. Petersburg==

Gapon and his wife had two children in rapid succession, but his wife fell ill following the 1898 birth of the second child, a boy. She died not long afterward, and Gapon decided to leave Poltava to make a new life in the capital city of Saint Petersburg. Bishop Ilarion made a strong recommendation to Konstantin Pobedonostsev, Procurator of the Holy Synod, that Gapon be allowed to take the entrance examination to the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy despite his lack of the standard Seminary certificate. Gapon placed 16th of 67 applicants and was subsequently awarded a scholarship reserved for the top prospects at the school. He would be one of 235 students to regularly attend classes at the school in 1898.

During his first year at the St. Petersburg Academy, Gapon became involved in missionary work for the church through the Society for Religious and Moral Enlightenment in the Spirit of the Orthodox Church. As part of this activity Gapon helped to conduct religious discussions in industrial shops, mess halls, and lodging houses, bringing him into close contact with the urban proletariat for the first time. The tightly wound Gapon found the strain of missionary work plus the demands of academic life to be too great and fell into a state of acute depression and he began skipping classes. He withdrew from school on a medical leave of absence and spent almost a year in Crimea in an attempt to regain his psychological health.

Gapon&#x27;s status as a student at the St. Petersburg Theological Academy, one of the elite theological training institutions of the Orthodox Church, placed him in good graces with Bishop Nikolai of Taurida, who permitted Gapon to live in a monastery near Sebastopol without having to take monastic vows. In Crimea he met several prominent members of the Tolstoyan movement, all of whom were intensely critical of the Orthodox Church and urged Gapon to leave the priesthood. Gapon rejected this advice, choosing instead to return to course work in St. Petersburg in November 1899, renewed and reinvigorated.

Gapon became a religious teacher at the St. Olga children&#x27;s orphanage in 1900 and became involved in working with factory workers and families impoverished by unemployment.

==Bloody Sunday==

Gapon, with the financial support of Colonel Akashi Motojiro of the Imperial Japanese Army organized the Assembly of Russian Factory and Mill Workers of St. Petersburg, which was also patronized by the Department of the Police and the St. Petersburg &quot;Okhrana&quot; and received support from Ivan Fullon, then Governor-General of Saint Petersburg. The Assembly&#x27;s objectives were to defend workers&#x27; rights and to elevate their moral and religious status. He was the person to lead the industrial workers to the capital of Russia during the year 1905. Only persons of Russian Orthodox faith were eligible to join the ranks. He received support from the police-sponsored trade unions established by Okhrana Chief Sergei Zubatov before their disbandment in 1903. The organization professed loyalty to the Russian Empire, beginning its meetings with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and concluding them with the imperial national anthem &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; At the same time, the Assembly had radical demands. Before the 1905 Russian Revolution, Gapon preached that the Tsar was a benevolent leader appointed by divine right who wanted to make fundamental reforms but was constantly thwarted by the boyars. Soon the organization had twelve branches and 8,000 members, and Gapon tried to expand activities to Kiev and Moscow. Gapon was not simply an obedient instrument of the police; cooperating with them, he tried to realize his plan for a positive change of the working class in Russia.

From the end of 1904, Gapon started to cooperate with radicals who championed the abolition of Tsarist autocracy.

On , the day after a general strike burst out in St. Petersburg, Gapon organized a workers&#x27; procession to present an emotionally charged written petition to the Tsar. The demonstration ended tragically as police fired upon the workers; the incident came to be known as Bloody Sunday. Gapon&#x27;s life was saved by Pinhas Rutenberg, who took him away from the gunfire and changed his priestly garments to a common man&#x27;s. He then became the guest of Maxim Gorky.

Following Bloody Sunday, Gapon anathematized the Tsar and called upon the workers to take action against the regime, but soon after escaped abroad, where he had close ties with the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Gapon and Rutenberg were welcomed in Europe both by prominent Russian émigrées Georgi Plekhanov, Vladimir Lenin, Peter Kropotkin and French socialist leaders Jean Jaurès and Georges Clemenceau. He found sanctuary in Geneva and in London at 33 Dunstan House, Stepney, with anarchists Peter Kropotkin and Rudolf Rocker. After the October Manifesto, before the end of 1905, Gapon returned to Russia and resumed contact with the Okhrana.

==Death==
Gapon soon revealed to Rutenberg, about his contacts with the police and tried to recruit him too, reasoning that dual loyalties were helpful to the workers&#x27; cause; however, Rutenberg reported this provocation to his party leaders, Yevno Azef, who was himself a secret police spy, and Boris Savinkov. On 26 March 1906, Gapon arrived to meet Rutenberg in a rented cottage outside St. Petersburg, and after a month he was found there hanged. Rutenberg asserted later that Gapon was condemned by a comrades&#x27; court. In reality, three SR party combatants overheard their conversation from the next room. After Gapon had repeated his collaboration proposal, Rutenberg called the comrades into the room and left. When he returned, Gapon was dead. Gapon died .

<text>Field lacrosse is a full contact outdoor sport played with two opposing teams of 10 players each. The sport originated among Native Americans, and the modern rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867. Field lacrosse is one of three major versions of lacrosse played internationally. The rules of men&#x27;s lacrosse differ significantly from women&#x27;s field lacrosse (established in the 1890s). The two are often considered to be different sports with a common root. An outdoor six-a-side version, lacrosse sixes, was established in 2021 and features six players per team, reduced field size, and shorter duration to be conducive for daily tournament play. Another version, indoor box lacrosse (originated in the 1930s), is also played under different rules.

The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick, or crosse, to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by shooting the ball into the opponent&#x27;s goal. The triangular head of the lacrosse stick has a loose net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. In addition to the lacrosse stick, players are required to wear a certain amount of protective equipment. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact. The rules limit the number of players in each part of the field. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;fastest sport on two feet&quot;.

Lacrosse is governed internationally by the 62-member World Lacrosse, which sponsors the World Lacrosse Championships once every four years. Field lacrosse is played professionally in North America by the Premier Lacrosse League. It is also played on a high amateur level by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the United States, the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association and the Maritime University Field Lacrosse League in Canada, and the Australian Senior Lacrosse Championship series in Australia.

== History ==
Lacrosse is a traditional Native American game. According to Native American beliefs, playing lacrosse is a spiritual act used for healing and giving thanks to the &quot;Creator&quot;. Another reason to play the game is to resolve minor conflicts between tribes that were not worth going to war for, thus the name &quot;little brother of war&quot;. These games could last several days and as many as 100 to 1,000 men from opposing villages or tribes played on open plains, between goals ranging from to several miles apart.

The first Europeans to observe it were French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley in the 1630s. The name &quot;lacrosse&quot; comes from their reports, which described the players&#x27; sticks as like a bishop&#x27;s crosier—&quot;la crosse&quot; in French. The Native American tribes used various names: in the Onondaga language it was called &quot;dehuntshigwa&#x27;es&quot; (&quot;they bump hips&quot; or &quot;men hit a rounded object&quot;); &quot;da-nah-wah&#x27;uwsdi&quot; (&quot;little war&quot;) to the Eastern Cherokee; in Mohawk, &quot;tewaarathon&quot; (&quot;little brother of war&quot;); and &quot;baggataway&quot; in Ojibwe. Variations in the game were not limited to the name. In the Great Lakes region, players used an entirely wooden stick, while the Iroquois stick was longer and was laced with string, and the Southeastern tribes played with two shorter sticks, one in each hand.

In 1867, Montreal Lacrosse Club member William George Beers codified the modern game. He established the Canadian Lacrosse Association and created the first written rules for the game, &quot;Lacrosse: The National Game of Canada&quot;. The book specified field layout, lacrosse ball dimensions, lacrosse stick length, number of players, and number of goals required to determine the match winner.

== Rules ==
The rules presented below are for the men&#x27;s game, which differs significantly from women&#x27;s lacrosse. Field lacrosse involves two teams, each competing to shoot a lacrosse ball into the opposing team&#x27;s goal. A lacrosse ball is made out of solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8 inches (19.7–20 cm) in circumference and weighing 5 to 5.25 ounces (140–149 g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a lacrosse stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.

The game has undergone significant changes since Beers&#x27; original codification. In the 1930s, the number of players on the field per team was reduced from twelve to ten, rules about protective equipment were established, and the field was shortened.

=== Playing area ===
A standard lacrosse field is in length from each endline, and in width from the sidelines.

Field lacrosse goals are centered between each sideline, positioned from each endline and apart from one another. Positioning the goals well within the endlines allows play to occur behind them. The goal is wide by tall, with nets attached in a pyramid shape. Surrounding each goal is a circular area known as the &quot;crease,&quot; measuring in diameter.

If a player enters the &quot;crease&quot; while shooting toward the goal, the referee will call a foul and the ball gets turned over to the other team.

A pair of lines, from both the midfield line and each goal line, divides the field into three sections. From each team&#x27;s point of view, the one nearest its own goal is its defensive area, then the midfield area, followed by the attack or offensive area. These trisecting lines are called &quot;restraining lines.&quot; A right angle line is marked from each sideline connecting each endline to the nearer restraining line, creating the &quot;restraining box.&quot; If an official deems that a team is &quot;stalling,&quot; that is not moving with offensive purpose while controlling the ball, the possessing team must keep the ball within the offensive restraining box to avoid a loss-of-possession penalty.

Field markings dictate player positioning during a face-off. A face-off is how play is started at the beginning of each period and after each goal. During a face-off, there are six players (without considering goalkeepers) in each of the areas defined by the restraining lines. Three midfielders from each team occupy the midfield area, while three attackmen and three of the opposing team&#x27;s defensemen occupy each offensive area. These players must stay in these areas until possession is earned by a midfielder or the ball crosses either restraining line. Wing areas are marked on the field on the midfield line from each sideline. This line indicates where the two nonface-off midfielders per team lineup during a face-off situation. These players may position themselves on either side of the midfield line. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks horizontally next to the ball, head of the stick inches from the ball and the butt-end pointing down the midfield line. Once the official blows the whistle to start play, the face-off midfielders scrap for the ball to earn possession and the other midfielders advance to play the ball. If possession is won by the face-off player, he may move the ball himself or pass to a teammate.

The rules also require that substitution areas, a penalty box, coaches area, and team bench areas be designated on the field.

=== Equipment ===
A field lacrosse player&#x27;s equipment includes a lacrosse stick, and protective equipment, including a lacrosse helmet with face mask, lacrosse gloves, and arm and shoulder pads. Players are also required to wear mouthguards and athletic supporter with cup pocket and protective cup. However, field players in the PLL are not required to wear shoulder pads.

Each player carries a lacrosse stick measuring long (a &quot;short crosse&quot;), or long (a &quot;long crosse&quot;). In most modern circles the word &quot;crosse&quot; has been replaced by &quot;stick&quot; and the terms &quot;short stick&quot; and &quot;long stick&quot; or &quot;pole&quot; are used. On each team up to four players at a time may use a long crosse: the three defensemen and one midfielder. The crosse is made up of the head and the shaft (or handle). The head is roughly triangular in shape and is loosely strung with mesh or leathers and nylon strings to form a &quot;pocket&quot; that allows the ball to be caught, carried, and thrown. In field lacrosse, the pocket of the crosse is illegal if the top of the ball, when placed in the head of the stick, is below the bottom of the stick&#x27;s sidewall.

The maximum width of the head at its widest point must be between . From 1.25 inches up from the bottom of the head, the distance between the sidewalls of the crosse must be at least 3 inches. Most modern sticks have a tubular metal shaft, usually made of aluminum, titanium, or alloys, while the head is made of hard plastic. Metal shafts must have a plastic or rubber cap at the end.

The sport&#x27;s growth has been hindered by the cost of a player&#x27;s equipment: a uniform, helmet, shoulder pads, hand protection, and lacrosse sticks. Many players have at least two lacrosse sticks prepared for use in any contest. Traditionally players used sticks made by Native American craftsman. These were expensive and, at times, difficult to find. The introduction of the plastic heads in the 1970s gave players an alternative to the wooden stick, and their mass production has led to greater accessibility and expansion of the sport.

=== Players ===

==== Goalkeeper ====
 
The goalkeeper&#x27;s responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring by directly defending the by goal. A goalkeeper needs to stop shots that are capable of reaching over , and is responsible for directing the team&#x27;s defense.

Goalkeepers have special privileges when they are in the crease, a circular area surrounding each goal with a radius of . Offensive players may not play the ball or make contact with the goalkeeper while he is in the crease. Once a goalkeeper leaves the crease, he loses these privileges.

A goalkeeper&#x27;s equipment differs from other players&#x27;. Instead of shoulder pads and elbow pads, the goalkeeper wears a chest protector. He also wears special &quot;goalie gloves&quot; that have extra padding on the thumb to protect from shots. The head of a goalkeeper&#x27;s crosse may measure up to wide, significantly larger than field players&#x27;.

==== Defensemen ====
A defenseman is a player position whose responsibility is to assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally remain on the defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this they will need to cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defenseman carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.

Tactics used by defensemen include body positioning and checking. Checking is attempting to dispossess the opposition of the ball through body or stick contact. A check may include a &quot;poke check&quot;, where a defenseman thrusts his crosse at the top hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball (similar to a billiards shot), or a &quot;slap check&quot;, where a player applies a short, two-handed slap to the hand or crosse of the opponent in possession of the ball. A &quot;body check&quot; is allowed as long as the ball is in possession or a loose ball is within five yards of the opposing player and the contact is made to the front or side of the torso of the opposing player. Defensemen preferably remain in a position relative to their offensive counterpart known as &quot;topside&quot;, which generally means a stick and body position that forces a ball carrier to go another direction, usually away from the goal.

==== Midfielders ====
Midfielders contribute offensively and defensively and may roam the entire playing area. Each team fields three midfielders at a time. One midfielder per team may use a long crosse, and in this case is referred to as a &quot;long-stick midfielder.&quot; Long-stick midfielders are normally used for defensive possessions and face-offs but can participate in offense as long as they are not subbed off.

Over time, the midfield position has developed into a position of specialties. During play, teams may substitute players in and out freely, a practice known as &quot;on the fly&quot; substitution. The rules state that substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players&#x27; bench. Teams frequently rotate the midfielder specialists off and on the field depending on the ball possession. Some teams have a designated face-off midfielder, referred to as a &quot;fogo&quot; midfielder (an acronym for &quot;face-off and get-off&quot;), who takes the majority of face-offs and is quickly substituted after the face-off. Some teams also designate midfielders as &quot;offensive midfielders&quot; or &quot;defensive midfielders&quot; depending on their strengths and weaknesses.

==== Attackmen ====
Each team fields three attackmen at a time, and these players generally remain on the offensive half of the field. An attackman uses a short crosse.

=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===
Duration of games depends upon the level of play. In international competition, college lacrosse, and Major League Lacrosse, the total playing time is 60 minutes, composed of four 15-minute quarters, plus a 15-minute intermission at halftime. High school games typically consist of four 12-minute quarters but can be played in 30-minute halves, while youth leagues may have shorter games. The clock typically stops during all dead ball situations such as between goals or if the ball goes out of bounds. The method of breaking a tie generally consists of multiple overtime periods of 5 minutes (4 in NCAA play, 10 in [MLL/PLL]) in which whoever scores a goal is awarded a sudden victory. A quicker variant of the sudden victory is the Braveheart method in which each team sends out one player and one goalie; it is then sudden victory. International lacrosse plays two straight 5-minute overtime periods, and then applies the sudden victory rule if the score is still tied.

=== Ball movement and out of play ===

Teams must advance the ball or be subjected to loss of possession. Once a team gains possession of the ball in their defensive area, they must move the ball over the midfield line within 20 seconds. If the goalkeeper has possession of the ball in the crease he must pass the ball or vacate the area within four seconds. Failure by the goalkeeper to leave the crease will result in the opposite team being given possession just outside the restraining box. Once the ball crosses the midfield line, a team has 10 seconds to move the ball into the offensive area designated by the restraining box or forfeit possession to their opponents. The term used to define moving the ball from the defensive to offensive area is to &quot;clear&quot; the ball. Offensive players are responsible for &quot;riding&quot; opponents, in other words attempting to deny the opposition a free &quot;clear&quot; of the ball over the midfield line.

If a ball travels outside of the playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.

=== Penalties ===
For most fouls, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one fewer player for a short amount of time. Penalties are classified as either personal fouls or technical fouls. Personal fouls are of a more serious nature and are generally penalised with a 1-minute suspension. Technical fouls are violations of the rules that are not as serious as personal fouls, and are penalised for 30 seconds or a loss of possession. Occasionally a longer penalty may be assessed for more severe infractions. Players penalised for 6 personal fouls must sit out the game. The penalised team is said to be playing man down defense while the other team is on the man up, or playing &quot;extra man offence.&quot; During a typical game, each team will have three to five extra man offence opportunities.

==== Personal fouls ====
Personal fouls (PF) include slashing, tripping, illegal body checking, cross checking, unsportsmanlike conduct, unnecessary roughness, and equipment violations. While a stick-check (where a player makes contact with the opposition player&#x27;s stick in order to knock the ball loose) is legal, a slashing violation is called when a player viciously makes contact with an opposing player or his stick. An illegal body check penalty is called for any contact where the ball is further than for high school and for youth from the contact, the check is from behind, above the shoulders or below the knees, or was avoidable after the player has released the ball. Cross checking, where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance, is illegal in field lacrosse. Both unsportsmanlike conduct and unnecessary roughness are subject to the officiating crew&#x27;s discretion, while equipment violations are governed strictly by regulations. Any deliberate intent to injure opponents risks immediate disqualification. For penalties resulting in a player being suspended from the game, a substitute player must serve the offender&#x27;s penalty time.

==== Technical fouls ====
Technical fouls include holding, interference, pushing, illegal offensive screening (usually referred to as a &quot;moving pick&quot;), &quot;warding off&quot;, stalling, and off-sides. A screen, as employed in basketball strategy, is a blocking move by an offensive player, by standing beside or behind a defender, to free a teammate to shoot, or receive a pass; as in basketball players must remain stationary when screening. Warding off occurs when an offensive player uses his free hand to control the stick of an opposing player.

Offside has a unique implementation in field lacrosse. Instituted with rule changes in 1921, it limits the number of players that are allowed on either side of the midfield line. Offside occurs when there are fewer than three players on the offensive side of the midfield line or when there are fewer than four players on the defensive half of the midfield line (note: if players are exiting through the special-substitution area, it is not to be determined an offside violation).

A technical foul requires that the defenseman who fouled a player on the opposing team be placed in the penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.

== Domestic competition ==
College lacrosse, a spring sport in the United States, saw its earliest program established by New York University in 1877. The first intercollegiate tournament was held in 1881 featuring four teams: New York University, Princeton University, Columbia University, and Harvard University. This tournament was won by Harvard. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) was created in 1885, and awarded the inaugural Wingate Memorial Trophy to the University of Maryland as national champions in 1936. The award was presented to the team (or teams) with the best record until the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) instituted a playoff system in 1971. The NCAA sponsored its premier Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship with the 1971 tournament where Cornell University defeated University of Maryland in the final. In addition to the three divisions in the NCAA, college lacrosse in the United States is played by non-varsity Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association and National College Lacrosse League club teams.
Lacrosse was first witnessed in England, Scotland, Ireland and France in 1867 when a team of Native Americans and Canadians traveled to Europe to showcase the sport. The year after, the English Lacrosse Association was established. In 1876, Queen Victoria attended an exhibition game and was impressed, saying, &quot;The game is very pretty to watch.&quot; Throughout Europe, lacrosse is played by numerous club teams and is overseen by the European Lacrosse Federation. Lacrosse was brought to Australia in 1876. The country sponsors various competitions among its states and territories that culminate in the annual Senior Lacrosse Championship tournament.

In 1985, the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA) was established, with twelve universities in the Ontario and Quebec provinces competing in the intercollegiate league. The league plays its season during the autumn. Unlike the NCAA, the CUFLA allows players that are professional box lacrosse players in the National Lacrosse League to participate, stating that &quot;although stick skills are identical, the game play and rules are different&quot;.

In 2005, a second Canadian University field lacrosse league, the Maritime University Field Lacrosse League (MUFLL) was founded, with six universities in the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia provinces.

Professional field lacrosse made its first appearance in 1988 with the formation of the American Lacrosse League, which folded after five weeks of play. In 2001, professional field lacrosse resurfaced with the inception of Major League Lacrosse (MLL), whose teams, based in the United States and Canada, play during the summer. The MLL modified its rules from the established field lacrosse rules of international, college, and high school programs. To increase scoring, the league employed a sixty-second shot clock, a two-point goal for shots taken outside a designated perimeter, and reduced the number of long sticks to three rather than the traditional four. Prior to the 2009 MLL season, after eight seasons, the league conformed to traditional field lacrosse rules and allowed a fourth long crosse. In 2018, the Premier Lacrosse League launched with 140 players leaving the MLL to form a league with higher media exposure, salaries, healthcare, licensing access, and other benefits. These 140 players consisted of 86 All-Americans, 25 members of the U.S. national team, and 10 former Tewaaraton Award winners. Both leagues merged in 2021, leaving the PLL as the sole men&#x27;s pro field lacrosse league in North America. The PLL has a variety of rule differences compared to field lacrosse. Like the MLL, the PLL also has two-point goals for goals scored outside of a certain perimeter. The field of play is shorter by 10 yards in the PLL. The distance between the goal line and the end line remain the same. The PLL also has a 52-second shot clock on possessions gained from defensive stops and other turnovers. The shot clock is 32-seconds from possessions gained off of face-offs and offensive rebounds.

== International competition ==
World Lacrosse is the international governing body of lacrosse and it oversees field, women&#x27;s and box lacrosse competitions. In 2008, the International Lacrosse Federation and the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Associations merged to form the Federation of International Lacrosse. The former International Lacrosse Federation was founded in 1974 to promote and develop the game of men&#x27;s lacrosse throughout the world. In May 2019, FIL changed its name to World Lacrosse. World Lacrosse sponsors the World Lacrosse Championship and Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships which are played under field lacrosse rules. It also oversees the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship played under box lacrosse rules, and the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup and an under-19 championship under women&#x27;s lacrosse rules.

=== Olympic Games ===
Lacrosse at the Olympics was a medal-earning sport in the 1904 Summer Olympics and the 1908 Summer Olympics. In 1904, three teams competed in the games held in Saint Louis, Missouri. Two Canadian teams, the Winnipeg Shamrocks and a team of Mohawk people from the Iroquois Confederacy, and an American team represented by the local St. Louis A.A.A. lacrosse club participated, and the Winnipeg Shamrocks captured the gold medal. The 1908 games held in London, England, featured only two teams, representing Canada and Great Britain. The Canadians again won the gold medal in a single championship match by a score of 14–10.
In the 1928 Summer Olympics, 1932 Summer Olympics, and the 1948 Summer Olympics, lacrosse was a demonstration sport. The 1928 Olympics featured three teams: the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The 1932 games featured a three-game exhibition between a Canadian All-star team and the United States. The United States was represented by Johns Hopkins Blue Jays lacrosse in both the 1928 and 1932 Olympics. In order to qualify, the Blue Jays won tournaments in the Olympic years to represent the United States. The 1948 games featured an exhibition by an &quot;All-England&quot; team organized by the English Lacrosse Union and the collegiate lacrosse team from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute representing the United States. This exhibition ended in a 5–5 tie.

There have been obstacles to reestablishing lacrosse as an Olympic sport. One hurdle was resolved in 2008, when the international governing bodies for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse merged to form the Federation of International Lacrosse, which was later renamed World Lacrosse. Another obstacle has been insufficient international participation. In the past, in order to be considered as an Olympic sport the game had to be played on four continents, and with at least a total of 75 countries participating. According to one US Lacrosse representative in 2004, &quot;it’ll take 15-20 years for us to get there.&quot; For the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia and 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, efforts were made to include lacrosse as an exhibition sport, but these failed. However, nowadays numeric criteria about widely practiced sports have been abolished. The International Olympic Committee granted provisional status to World Lacrosse in 2018 and Lacrosse may be included in the 2028 Summer Olympics. In August 2022, It was announced that nine sports had made the shortlist to be included in the games, among them lacrosse, with presentations expected to be made later that month. In October 2023, the LA28 Organizing Committee announced that it had recommended lacrosse as one of five sports that may be added to the program for the 2028 Summer Olympics. On October 16, 2023 the IOC approved lacrosse to be included in the 2028 Olympics. The competition will take place in the lacrosse sixes format.

=== World Lacrosse Championships ===

The World Lacrosse Championship began as a four-team invitational tournament in 1967 sanctioned by the International Lacrosse Federation. The 2006 World Lacrosse Championship featured a record twenty-one competing nations. The 2010 World Lacrosse Championship took place in Manchester, England. Only United States, Canada, and Australia have finished in the top two places of this tournament. Since 1990, the Iroquois Nationals, a team consisting of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy members, have competed in international competition. This team is the only Native American team sanctioned to compete in any men&#x27;s sport internationally. The Federation of International Lacrosse also sanctions the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships. The 2008 Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships included twelve countries, with three first-time participants: Bermuda, Finland, and Scotland.

Other regional international competitions are played including the European Lacrosse Championships, sponsored by the twenty-one member European Lacrosse Federation, and the eight team Asian Pacific Lacrosse Tournament.

=== World Games ===
Men&#x27;s field lacrosse was played at the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama using the &quot;Sixes&quot; ruleset. Qualification for the tournament was based on the nations placement at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. Initially, the Iroquois Nationals were not included in the qualified teams, however, they were determined to be eligible for the tournament, and Ireland voluntarily withdrew from the tournament to allow them to participate. Canada won gold, the U.S. took silver, and Japan defeated Great Britain for the bronze medal.

== Attendance records ==
Lacrosse attendance has grown with the sport&#x27;s popularity. The 2008 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship was won by Syracuse University, beating Johns Hopkins University 13–10, in front of a title game record crowd of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium. The 2007 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship weekend held at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, was played in front of a total crowd of 123,225 fans for the three-day event. The current attendance record for a regular season lacrosse-only event was set by the 2009 Big City Classic, a triple-header at Giants Stadium which drew 22,308 spectators. The Denver Outlaws hold the professional field lacrosse single-game attendance record by playing July 4, 2015 in front of 31,644 fans.

At the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, California, over 145,000 spectators watched the three-game series between the United States and Canada, including 75,000 people who witnessed the first game of the series while in attendance to watch the final of the marathon.

<text>Tom Holliston (born April 21, 1960) is a Canadian punk rock musician. Primarily associated with the bands Nomeansno and The Hanson Brothers, he also leads the side project Showbusiness Giants, and has released four solo records since 2002.

Showbusiness Giants, a rotating collective of musicians which included Scott Henderson, John Wright, Andy Kerr, Carolyn Mark, Ken Kempster, Keith Rose and Ford Pier, became best known for the single &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on Wendy Mesley&quot;, from the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Talk With the Dead&quot;, which was a hit on Canada&#x27;s campus radio charts in 1995.

For touring in support of &quot;Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?&quot;, Nomeansno hired Holliston to replace Andy Kerr. Holliston went on to become their full-time guitarist. The first Nomeansno album to feature Holliston was &quot;The Worldhood of the World (As Such)&quot;, released in 1995. Holliston announced his departure from the band in August 2016. One month later, on September 24, John Wright announced the band&#x27;s official retirement.

<doc id="706155" wikidata="Q849159" url="?curid=706155" title="Fully qualified domain name">
<text>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN), sometimes also called an absolute domain name, is a domain name that specifies its exact location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone. A fully qualified domain name is distinguished by its lack of ambiguity in terms of DNS zone location in the hierarchy of DNS labels: it can be interpreted only in one way.

==Definition==
A fully qualified domain name is conventionally written as a list of domain labels separated using the full stop &quot;&quot; character (&quot;dot&quot; or &quot;period&quot;). The top of the hierarchy in an FQDN begins with the rightmost label. For instance, in the FQDN , is a label directly under the root zone, is nested under , and finally is nested under .

The topmost layer of every domain name is the DNS root zone, which is expressed as an empty label and can be represented in an FQDN with a trailing dot, such as . A trailing dot is generally implied and often omitted by most applications. Trailing dots are required by the standard format for DNS zone files, as well as to disambiguate cases where an FQDN does not contain any other label separators, such as the FQDNs for the root zone itself and any top-level domain.

The length of each label must be between 1 and 63 octets, and the full domain name is limited to 255 octets, full stops included.

==Relative domain names==
A relative domain name is a domain name which does not include all labels. It may also be referred to as a partially-qualified domain name, or PQDN. Hostnames can be used as relative domain names.

==Usage==
Dot-separated fully qualified domain names are the primarily used form for human-readable representations of a domain name. Dot-separated domain names are not used in the internal representation of labels in a DNS message but are used to reference domains in some TXT records and can appear in resolver configurations, system hosts files, and URLs.

Web addresses typically use FQDNs to represent the host, as it ensures the address will be interpreted identically on any network. Relative hostnames are allowed by some protocols, including HTTP, but disallowed by others, such as the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

<text>Wilbur Lincoln Scoville (January 22, 1865 – March 10, 1942) was an American pharmacist best known for his creation of the &quot;Scoville Organoleptic Test&quot;, now standardized as the Scoville scale. He devised the test and scale in 1912 while working at the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company to measure pungency, &quot;spiciness&quot; or &quot;capsaicin concentration” of various chili peppers.

==Early life==
Scoville was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 22, 1865. He married Cora B. Upham on September 1, 1891, in Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts). They had two daughters: Amy Augusta, born August 21, 1892, and Ruth Upham, born October 21, 1897.

== Career ==
Scoville wrote &quot;The Art of Compounding&quot;, which was first published in 1895 and has gone through at least 8 editions. The book was used as a pharmacological reference up until the 1960s, also making one of the earliest mentions of milk as an antidote for pepper heat. Scoville also wrote &quot;Extracts and Perfumes&quot;, which contained hundreds of formulations.

For a time he was a professor at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. In 1912, he devised the test and scale known as the &quot;Scoville Organoleptic Test&quot; while working at the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company. While using human testers, it measured pungency, or &quot;spiciness&quot;, of various chili peppers. It is now standardized as the Scoville scale.

== Death ==
Scoville died on March 10, 1942, at the age of 77 in Gainesville, Florida. It is unknown how he died.

==Awards==
In 1922, Scoville won the Ebert prize from the American Pharmaceutical Association, which is given to &quot;recognize the author(s) of the best report of original investigation of a medicinal substance.&quot; In 1929, he received the Remington Honor Medal, the APhA&#x27;s top award. Scoville also received an honorary Doctor of Science from Columbia University in 1929.

<doc id="706170" wikidata="Q366956" url="?curid=706170" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">
<text>Robert Montgomery (; born Henry Montgomery Jr.; May 21, 1904 – September 27, 1981) was an American actor, director, and producer. He began his acting career on the stage, but was soon hired by MGM. Initially assigned roles in comedies, he soon proved he was able to handle dramatic ones, as well. He appeared in a wide variety of roles, such as the weak-willed prisoner Kent in &quot;The Big House&quot; (1930), the psychotic Danny in &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1937), and Joe, the boxer mistakenly sent to Heaven in &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941). The last two earned him nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

During World War II, he drove ambulances in France until the Dunkirk evacuation. When the United States entered the war on December 8, 1941, he enlisted in the Navy, and was present at the invasion at Normandy. After the war, he returned to Hollywood, where he worked in both films, and later, in television. He was also the father of actress Elizabeth Montgomery.

== Early life ==
Henry Montgomery, Jr., was born in Fishkill Landing, New York (now Beacon, New York), to Henry Montgomery and his wife, Mary Weed Montgomery (née Barney), and was of Scottish and Scots-Irish heritage. His father was president of the New York Rubber Company, and died by suicide in 1922 by jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, when the family&#x27;s fortune was gone.

== Career ==

Montgomery settled in New York City to try his hand at writing and acting. He established a stage career, and became popular enough to turn down an offer to appear opposite Vilma Bánky in the film &quot;This Is Heaven&quot; (1929). Sharing a stage with George Cukor gave him an entry to Hollywood and a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he debuted in &quot;So This Is College&quot; (also 1929). One writer claimed that Montgomery was able to establish himself because he &quot;proceeded with confidence, agreeable with everyone, eager and willing to take suggestions&quot;. However, he also was said to be regarded by some as chilly or pompous &quot;off-screen.&quot;

During the production of &quot;So This Is College&quot;, Montgomery learned from and questioned crew members from several departments, including sound crew, electricians, set designers, camera crew, and film editors. In a later interview, he confessed, &quot;it showed [him] that making a motion picture is a great co-operative project.&quot; &quot;So This Is College&quot; gained him attention as Hollywood&#x27;s latest newcomer, and he was put in one production after another, his popularity growing steadily.

Montgomery initially played exclusively in comedy roles; his first dramatic role was in &quot;The Big House&quot; (1930). MGM was initially reluctant to assign him the role, until &quot;his earnestness, and his convincing arguments, with demonstrations of how he would play the character&quot; won him the assignment. From &quot;The Big House&quot; on, he was in constant demand. He appeared as Greta Garbo&#x27;s romantic interest in &quot;Inspiration&quot; (1930).


Norma Shearer chose him to star opposite her in &quot;The Divorcee&quot; (1930), &quot;Strangers May Kiss&quot; (1931), and &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1931), which led him to stardom. In 1932, Montgomery starred opposite Tallulah Bankhead in &quot;Faithless&quot;, though the film was not a success. During this time, Montgomery appeared in the original pre-Code film version of &quot;When Ladies Meet&quot; (1933), which starred Ann Harding and Myrna Loy. In 1935, Montgomery became president of the Screen Actors Guild, and was elected again in 1946. Montgomery played a psychopathic murderer in the thriller &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1937), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

After World War II began in Europe in September 1939, and while the United States was still officially neutral, Montgomery enlisted in London for the American Field Service and drove ambulances in France until the Dunkirk evacuation. He then returned to Hollywood and addressed a massive rally on the MGM lot for the American Red Cross in July 1940.

Montgomery returned to playing light comedy roles, such as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (1941) with Carole Lombard. He continued his search for dramatic roles. For his role as Joe Pendleton, a boxer and pilot in &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941), Montgomery was nominated for an Oscar a second time. After the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, he joined the United States Navy, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander, and served on the staff of the commander of Destroyer Squadrons 5 and 60; commanding officer PT-107; aboard the light cruiser USS &quot;Columbia&quot;; as an assistant naval attache at the U.S. Embassy, London; and as the executive officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 5 (PT-5).

In 1945, Montgomery returned to Hollywood, co-starring and making his uncredited directing debut in &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;, where he directed some of the PT boat scenes when director John Ford was unable to work for health reasons. Montgomery&#x27;s first credited film as director and his final film for MGM was the film noir &quot;Lady in the Lake&quot; (1947), adapted from Raymond Chandler&#x27;s detective novel, in which he starred as Chandler&#x27;s most famous character, Phillip Marlowe. It was filmed entirely from Marlowe&#x27;s vantage point; Montgomery appeared on camera only a few times, three times in a mirror reflection. He also directed and starred in the film noir&quot;Ride the Pink Horse&quot;. 

Active in Republican politics and concerned about communist influence in the entertainment industry, Montgomery was a friendly witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. The next year, 1948, Montgomery hosted the Academy Awards. He hosted an Emmy Award-winning television series, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, which ran from 1950 to 1957. &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; (1960), a film Montgomery directed and co-produced with its star, his friend James Cagney, was the last film or television production with which he was connected in any capacity, as actor, director, or producer. In 1955, Montgomery was awarded a Tony Award for his direction of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;.

A pioneering media consultant, Montgomery took an unpaid position as consultant and coach to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, advising him on how to look his best on television and maintaining an office in the Eisenhower White House.

Montgomery has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for movies at 6440 Hollywood Boulevard and another for television at 1631 Vine Street.

== Personal life and death ==

On April 14, 1928, Montgomery married actress Elizabeth Bryan Allen (December 26, 1904 – June 28, 1992), sister of stage actress Martha-Bryan Allen. The couple had three children: Martha Bryan, who died at 14 months of age in 1931; Elizabeth (April 15, 1933 – May 18, 1995), an actress best known for her 1960s television series, &quot;Bewitched&quot;; and Robert, Jr., (January 6, 1936 – February 7, 2000). They divorced on December 5, 1950.

His second wife was Elizabeth &quot;Buffy&quot; Grant Harkness (1909–2003), wed on December 9, 1950, four days after his divorce from Allen was finalized.

He died of cancer on September 27, 1981, at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. His body was cremated and the ashes were given to the family. His two surviving children, Elizabeth and Robert Montgomery Jr., both died of cancer, as well.

<doc id="706171" wikidata="Q7824649" url="?curid=706171" title="Top Up TV">
<text>Top Up TV was a pay TV service in the United Kingdom that was launched in March 2004, operating on the digital terrestrial television platform. The service aimed to &quot;top up&quot; Freeview customers by providing additional content and services through encrypted TV channels unavailable to other viewers.

The service offered a variety of content from various providers through &#x27;TV Favourites&#x27;, and old and low-budget movies from NBCUniversal through PictureBox Movies, all of which could be viewed on demand. Top Up TV formerly offered live premium sports channels including ESPN, Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2. The service could be received by equipment having a built-in card slot: a DVB-T set-top box, a recorder or an integrated television receiver. As of July 2013, there were approximately 200,000 subscribers.

In late 2013, Top Up TV ceased broadcasting and sold its subscriber business to Sky.

==History==
The company was founded by two former BSkyB executives, David Chance and Ian West. The management team consisted of Chance as chairman and Nick Markham as chief executive officer. Top Up TV was 20% owned by Channel 5 and restructured during 2006, with the original company liquidated under Members Voluntary Liquidation under the name Minds1. The owner of Access Industries, Len Blavatnik, is said to have purchased a 70% stake in January 2007.

According to the Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the accounts lodged by Top Up TV Europe S.a.r.l. in 2010 indicated costs of €38 million, debts of €23 million and ongoing losses of €21 million.

===2004–06: Launch and early years===
Top Up TV, as &quot;Newincco 166 Ltd&quot;, bid for the multiplex D licence on the DTT service in 2002 in a joint application with Carlton, Granada and Channel 4, trading as the Digital Terrestrial Alliance (DTA). The company were prepared to offer a &quot;viable&quot; and &quot;lite-pay&quot; service, which would have provided a large number of free-to-air channels and a few pay-TV ones. The bid was unsuccessful, and the licence was instead awarded to the BBC, BSkyB and Crown Castle, which later became National Grid Wireless.

After unsuccessful multiplex bid, Top Up TV turned to public service broadcasters Channel 5 and Channel 4 to gain capacity on the platform. On multiplex A, Top Up TV were granted four long-term streams (one of which previously hosted TV Travel Shop), and on multiplex 2, were granted one short-term stream from Channel 4. They came up with a time-shared system which allowed 10 pay-TV channels to be broadcast in the space of five television streams, two of which were allotted &quot;empty&quot; space, which later became ABC1 and Teachers&#x27; TV. The sixth stream was used as a temporary measure (as of the short-term contract with Channel 4), and hosted pay-per-view channels Xtraview and Red Hot.

Top Up TV focused less on the premium services which had been prominent on ITV Digital prior to 2002. By 2005, eleven channels were available on the service but were all timeshared. Overnight this dropped to as few as two channels (from the main package), in order to make space for premium adult entertainment channels.

From its launch in 2004, a promotional video presented by Alice Beer ran on the channel placeholders and the Top Up TV Sampler channel. From March 2004, Top Up TV provided a package of 10 timeshared TV channels which was joined by an eleventh in 2005: UKTV Gold, UKTV Style, UKTV Food, Discovery Channel, Discovery Home &amp; Leisure, TCM, E4, Bloomberg, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. On 27 May 2005, E4 left Top Up TV to become a free-to-air channel and was replaced by British Eurosport which began broadcasting on the platform on 1 June 2005. Toonami also joined the line-up. Discovery Home &amp; Leisure was rebranded Discovery Real Time. In its first year of operation, the company made losses of £7 million. The original service broke even at 250,000 subscribers (according to some sources) around the Time Top Up TV Anytime was announced. This figure fell significantly short of the claimed potential subscriber numbers of 650,000 as set out in the original Freeview Plus proposal document, due to the differing market in 2004 and increasing competition from Sky (who had acquired ITV Digital&#x27;s customer details) and cable TV companies.

Top Up TV provided additional services such as Xtraview which offered Top Up TV channels on a per-day basis, but closed down after Channel 4 wanted the stream back for its own use. This was replaced for a time by Top Up TV Pay As You Go. Top Up TV Active was an interactive advertising service that replaced the off-air MHEG screens on channel 107; it also featured an audio version of QuizWorld.

In August 2005, Setanta Sports broadcast live pay-per-view Scottish Premier League matches in conjunction with Top Up TV, using Top Up TV&#x27;s Xtraview technology. Originally this was only available to viewers in Scotland, but was made available nationwide in early 2006.

By 9 February 2007, all but two live channels on the service had been replaced with the push video-on-demand service, as the original package was slowly phased out. However, premium sports could still be accessed on a live basis. The Xtraview access control system was still in use for TelevisionX.

===2006–13: On-demand and premium sports===
On 30 August 2006, Top Up TV announced that it was to launch a new service known as Top Up TV Anytime. The new service required a Top Up TV Anytime DTR, effectively a digital terrestrial television recorder, which allowed access to on-demand and encrypted channels. The original service, following Anytime&#x27;s launch, was later mostly phased out, being reduced to two live non-sport channels, Gold and Home. Existing channels of the original service at launch closed down or had their hours reduced before being phased out completely. These channels, along with new channels such as Living and Disney Channel, joined the new service and began offering content on an on-demand basis. PictureBox Movies launched as a premium movies add-on in October 2006.

Also in 2006, Inview Technology launched the world&#x27;s first push-VOD service for Top Up TV.

On 11 February 2007, Top Up TV&#x27;s per-per-view Scottish Premier League matches were discontinued, and the Setanta Sports channel was made available on Top Up TV by a separate subscription. The Setanta Sports channel ceased broadcasting in June 2009 after the company went bust.

In 2009, Top Up TV Anytime was rebranded into TV Favourites, spawning PictureBox and the newly launched ESPN into viewing packs available as part of TV Favourites or available separately. Monday 2 August 2010 saw Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 launch through Top Up TV.

Originally, four streams were used to distribute the TV Favourites service, but the fourth stream was taken off air on 11 January 2010. The third stream was pulled from air roughly ten months later. The first stream under the name of &quot;Top Up TV Anytime 1&quot; in the EPG timeshared with ESPN, and the second stream under the name of &quot;Top Up TV Anytime 3&quot; in the EPG timeshared with Home, Gold, and Television X.

===2013: Loss of sports and closure===
In June 2013, following the acquisition of ESPN by BT Sport and the announcement of the removal of Sky Sports 1 &amp; 2 from the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) network by BT, Top Up TV began sending letters to their customers stating that their premium sports package(s) would be discontinued. Sky Sports 1 &amp; 2 were removed on 1 July, and ESPN on 1 August.

In September, Top Up TV sent customers on the TV Favourites and PictureBox packages letters informing them that the service would cease broadcasting on 31 October 2013 and that all remaining subscriptions will cease automatically. TUTV advised that the hardware will continue to work as a Freeview decoder. This brought the period of uncertainty about TUTV&#x27;s future to an end.

On 31 October, Top Up TV placed a notice on their website stating that they had ceased broadcasting. The company sold their subscriber business to Sky where new subscribers to Sky could get up to 50% off for a year if they went through Top Up TV. Until June 2015, the company continued to run conditional access to the Freeview platform which BT used to broadcast BT Sports 1 and 2.

==Services==
===TV Favourites===
Launched in December 2006 as Top Up TV Anytime, the service offered video on demand content from many channels. In 2009, Top Up TV Anytime was rebranded as TV Favourites, as Top Up TV no longer needed the Anytime brand to differentiate its on-demand service from its previous linear service. The service was only accessible through a Top Up TV DVB-T DVR set top box. Content was available by pressing the Top Up TV button on the remote whilst watching a TV channel or perusing the EPG. Over time, channels like Living and Home were phased out, replaced by programmes from the BBC, Warner Bros. Television and The Walt Disney Company. The channel icons displayed on the Top Up TV EPG changed from being the logo of their respective channel in favour of a uniform genre list.

Providers that were available at the time were:

Comedy/Drama
*Gold
*United States drama from ABC

Factual
*Crime &amp; Investigation Network
*History
*Home

===PictureBox===

PictureBox was a movies service in which around 28 old and low-budget movies were downloaded to the subscriber&#x27;s Top Up TV Freeview+ box every night for a monthly fee. Movies offered were from the NBCUniversal library. Seven films were available at any one time, with titles being refreshed nightly. The service launched in October 2006 and was the first premium add-on available to Top Up TV customers. Top Up TV was the first platform in the world to host the service along with its TV programmes spin-off, TV Box.

===ESPN===

ESPN was a premium sport channel offering Premier League football, among other sports, for a monthly fee. The channel could be accessed through a conditional-access module (CAM), set top box with a slot, an IDTV with a slot or through a Top Up TV Freeview+ box. It replaced Setanta Sports 1 when its parent company went into administration and was closed. Because this channel time-shared with the downloads for the TV Favourites service, it was barred from broadcasting 24 hours a day. Between Setanta Sports 1 closing and ESPN launching, ESPN America filled airtime whilst carriage negotiations were ongoing. The channel is still offered by BT TV under their BT Sport package.

===Sky Sports===

Sky Sports 1 and 2 were also offered as of 2 August 2010 as Ofcom&#x27;s pay-TV review saw the channels being offered under a wholesale must offer (WMO) agreement which effectively forces BSkyB to offer these channels to its competitors. Using capacity which BT secured and used to offer the same channels to its BT Vision subscribers, Top Up TV also offered these two channels to its subscribers which officially launched on 2 August 2010. Top Up TV had been able to offer Sky Sports 1 &amp; 2, and ESPN via a conditional-access module from October 2011. This was possible only via CI+ compatible IDTVs and set-top boxes.

==Equipment==

Top Up TV offered its services over a range of devices. The Top Up TV Freeview+ DTRs offered all services from Top Up TV. All Top Up TV set-top boxes and CAMs allowed access to ESPN whilst the CI+ CAM and approved set-top boxes allowed viewers to subscribe to Sky Sports and ESPN. A viewing smartcard (viewing card) is used to unlock customers&#x27; services. Top Up TV used the Nagravision Merlin (NagraVision 3) encryption since a card swap in 2008. Previously programmes were encrypted by MediaGuard SECA2, a more secure version of the encryption system of previous digital terrestrial incumbent ITV Digital. All Top Up TV set top boxes and DTRs were required to have at least an 8-day EPG, similar to the requirement for normal Freeview boxes.

===Top Up TV Freeview+ box (DTR)===

A range of Top Up TV Freeview+ digital TV recorders, also known as DTRs, automatically records programmes broadcast overnight, which the user can then watch on-demand. The first generation box was manufactured by Thomson – Thomson DTI 6300-16 containing a 160GB HDD. Higher capacity boxes were introduced later on with the Thomson DTI 6300–25, effectively the Thomson DTI 6300-16 with a 250GB HDD. Different manufacturer&#x27;s equipment such as Luxor, Bush, Sharp, Wharfdale and a new Thomson box were available from retailers such as Argos and ASDA. These newer boxes contain varying degrees of capacity ranging from 160GB to 500GB.

Included in the packaging was a Top Up TV bespoke remote control and SCART lead, a signal improvement kit, an RF lead and a power cable. Printed materials include the Top Up TV welcome pack, a remote control codes guide and an instruction manual. The rear of the box had two SCART sockets, two tuners, an S-Video output, analogue phono output and Digital Audio output. It featured a powered but functionless USB port on the front or rear of the DTR.

===Set-top box (STB)===
Initially, Top Up TV made use of set-top boxes with viewing card slots to offer a linear pay TV service. At launch, only ex-ITV Digital boxes were available, but new boxes were soon produced, bearing the &quot;Top Up TV Ready&quot; logo. Since the unavoidable move towards on demand, the live channel hours were reduced and eventually closed.

All previous &quot;Top Up TV Ready&quot; set-top boxes with viewing card slots were later only able to receive ESPN. With the launch of Sky Sports in 2010, BSkyB insisted that the viewing smart card must be paired to the set-top box. Whilst Top Up TV Freeview+ DTR&#x27;s have this facility using the CAN number, few other set-top boxes offered this facility and had to be approved by Top Up TV. These approved boxes included the i-CAN Freeview HD Box, the Top Up TV T215 and Sagem IDT68 and IDT72.

===Conditional-access module (CAM)===
A conditional-access module can be inserted into a CI slot mostly found on modern IDTVs to enable decryption of encrypted services. Whilst Top Up TV offered a branded CAM, only ESPN could be received. This is due to BSkyB having concerns with the security of these modules meaning Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 are not available.

CI+ CAMs were due to become available to overcome such security concerns, offering access to Sky Sports and ESPN from August 2011, but there were delays to the launch due to Top Up TV having difficulties trying to identify compatible devices. These devices finally appeared in October 2011.

<text>The Zamora Trophy () is a football award, established by Spanish newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; in 1958. The award goes to the goalkeeper who has the lowest &quot;goals-to-games&quot; ratio.

In the inaugural year of the award, the winning goalkeeper had to play at least 15 league matches in the current season. In 1964, the limit for matches a goalkeeper had to play was raised to 22. In 1983, it was raised to 28 matches, including the rule that the goalkeeper had to play at least 60 minutes in match for it to count.

In the last couple of years the list of goalkeepers who would have won the trophy prior to 1958 has been published. For these seasons, a limit of matches that the goalkeeper had to play has been applied. For the leagues with only 10 teams the limit of matches was 14, for those of 12 teams it was 17 and for those of 14 the limit was 20 matches. For those leagues of 16 teams it is 22 – as originally established for the trophy from 1964 to 1983.

== Rules ==
* For a goalkeeper to be eligible for the trophy he should play at least 28 matches, considered calculable, during the league season. For a match to be considered calculable the goalkeeper should play, at least, 60 minutes of said match.
* The winner shall be the goalkeeper who has the lowest coefficient, worked out to the second decimal place (hundredths). This is calculated by dividing all goals conceded in the league (including those matches which aren&#x27;t calculable i.e. those in which the goalkeeper has played less than 60 minutes) by the total number of calculable matches.
* The trophy can be won by more than one goalkeeper if they have the same coefficient. In which case each goalkeeper shall be awarded a trophy.
* Each week MARCA shall publish a provisional league table. Until one or more goalkeepers reach the 28 calculable matches the league table shall reward those goalkeepers who have played the most calculable matches, and within those, the one who has the lowest coefficient.

<text>Vincent Gerard &quot;Vini&quot; Reilly (born 4 August 1953) is an English musician and leader of the post-punk group the Durutti Column. He was known for his distinctively clean, fluid guitar style, which stood out from his punk-era contemporaries in its incorporation of jazz, folk, and classical elements. In addition to his work under that group, Reilly also collaborated with artists such as Morrissey, John Cooper Clarke, Pauline Murray, Anne Clark, and others.

==Biography==
Reilly was born on 4 August 1953 in Higher Blackley, Manchester, and raised in Withington, Wythenshawe and Didsbury, Manchester. His father was an engineer who did not allow his five children to watch television. At age 16, Reilly&#x27;s father died. He later lamented that he did not admire or know him enough. As a youngster, Reilly was a talented footballer. He was offered a trial for Manchester City F.C., but he declined, opting to concentrate on music.

His first recorded work was Ed Banger &amp; The Nosebleeds&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Bin To No Music School&quot;.

Reilly was Tony Wilson&#x27;s first signing to Factory Records in Manchester. Brian Eno cited Reilly&#x27;s album &quot;LC&quot; as his all-time favourite album and Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; John Frusciante stated that Reilly was &quot;the best guitarist in the world&quot;.

Reilly arranged music and played guitar on fellow Manchester artist Morrissey&#x27;s first post-Smiths album &quot;Viva Hate&quot; (1988). Morrissey and Reilly have both been members of The Nosebleeds, but in different incarnations of the group. Reilly also recorded with artists including John Cooper Clarke, Pauline Murray, Anne Clark, The Wake, Richard Jobson, Quando Quango, Craig Davies, Swing Out Sister and Holly Johnson (on his 2014 album &quot;Europa&quot;).

In September 2010, Reilly had a &quot;minor&quot; stroke which made him lose &quot;some feeling in his left hand&quot;. Despite this, in February 2011 it was reported that he was working on a new album. The new tracks are slower because, after the stroke, he could not play as fast as he used to. In January 2013, Reilly&#x27;s nephew made an Internet appeal on his behalf for donations because the guitarist had debts for unpaid rent from the time between his strokes and his assessment for disability benefit. Fans sent £3,000 within a day and Reilly was reported to feel that their generosity had &quot;lifted the weight of the world off his shoulders&quot;.
