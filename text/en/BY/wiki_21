<text>In gynecology, a rectocele ( ) or posterior vaginal wall prolapse results when the rectum bulges (herniates) into the vagina. Two common causes of this defect are childbirth and hysterectomy. Rectocele also tends to occur with other forms of pelvic organ prolapse, such as enterocele, sigmoidocele and cystocele.

Although the term applies most often to this condition in females, males can also develop it. Rectoceles in men are uncommon, and associated with prostatectomy.

==Signs and symptoms==

Mild cases may simply produce a sense of pressure or protrusion within the vagina, and the occasional feeling that the rectum has not been completely emptied after a bowel movement. Moderate cases may involve difficulty passing stool (because the attempt to evacuate pushes the stool into the rectocele instead of out through the anus), discomfort or pain during evacuation or intercourse, constipation, and a general sensation that something is &quot;falling down&quot; or &quot;falling out&quot; within the pelvis. Severe cases may cause vaginal bleeding, intermittent fecal incontinence, or even the prolapse of the bulge through the mouth of the vagina, or rectal prolapse through the anus. Digital evacuation, or, manual pushing, on the posterior wall of the vagina helps to aid in bowel movement in a majority of cases of rectocele. Rectocele can be a cause of symptoms of obstructed defecation.

==Causes==
Rectoceles result from the weakening of the pelvic floor also called pelvic organ prolapse. Weakened pelvic structures occur as a result of an episiotomy during previous births, even decades later. Other causes of pelvic floor prolapse can be advanced age, multiple vaginal deliveries, and birthing trauma. Birthing trauma includes vacuum delivery, forceps delivery, and perineal tear.  In addition, a history of chronic constipation and excessive straining with bowel movements are thought to play a role in rectocele.  Multiple gynecological or rectal surgeries can also lead to weakening of the pelvic floor. Births that involve babies over nine pounds in weight, or rapid births can contribute to the development of rectocele.

A hysterectomy or other pelvic surgery can be a cause, as can chronic constipation and straining to pass bowel movements. It is more common in older women than in younger ones because estrogen which helps to keep the pelvic tissues elastic decreases after menopause.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of a rectocele primarily occurs with a physical examination and an interview where symptoms of difficulty defecating are reported.  Women often mention the need to insert a finger in the vagina or use of suppositories and/or enemas to aid in having a bowel movement. They may report that strenuous pushing to defecate causes bleeding and pain.  Surveys about the impact on quality of life may be administered to aid in determining the need for treatment.

A pelvic exam and digital rectal exam are done to evaluate the amount of protrusion and anal sphincter tone. Fluoroscopic defecography (FD), evacuation proctography, or dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MR defecography, MRD) may be used to evaluate functional and anatomic conditions.

==Treatment==

=== Non-surgical ===
Treatment depends on the severity of the problem, and may include non-surgical methods such as changes in diet (increase in fiber and water intake), pelvic floor exercises such as Kegel exercises, use of stool softeners, hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women and insertion of a pessary into the vagina. Vaginal pessaries can immediately relieve prolapse and prolapse-related symptoms. A high fiber diet, consisting of 25–30 grams of fiber daily, as well as increased water intake (typically 6–8 glasses daily), help to avoid constipation and straining with bowel movements, and can relieve symptoms of rectocele.

=== Surgical ===
Surgery can be done to correct rectocele when symptoms continue despite the use of non-surgical management, and are significant enough to interfere with activities of daily living.

Surgery to correct the rectocele may involve the reattachment of the muscles that previously supported the pelvic floor. Another procedure is posterior colporrhaphy, which involves suturing of vaginal tissue. Surgery may also involve insertion of a supporting mesh (that is, a patch). There are also surgical techniques directed at repairing or strengthening the rectovaginal septum, rather than simple excision or plication of vaginal skin which provides no support. Both gynecologists and colorectal surgeons can address this problem. Potential complications of surgical correction of a rectocele include bleeding, infection, dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), as well as recurrence or even worsening of the rectocele symptoms. The use of synthetic or biologic grafts has been questioned.

<text>Interstate 196 (I-196) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs for in the US state of Michigan. It is a state trunkline highway that links Benton Harbor, South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids. In Kent, Ottawa, and Allegan counties, I-196 is known as the Gerald R. Ford Freeway, or simply the Ford Freeway, after President Gerald Ford, who was raised in Grand Rapids and served Michigan in the House of Representatives for 25 years. This name generally refers only to the section between Holland and Grand Rapids. I-196 changes direction; it is signed as a north–south highway from its southern terminus to the junction with US Highway 31 (US 31) just south of Holland, and as an east–west trunkline from this point to its eastern terminus at an interchange with I-96, its parent highway. There are three business routes related to the main freeway. There are two business loops (BL I-196) and one business spur (BS I-196) that serve South Haven, Holland and the Grand Rapids areas. Another business spur for Muskegon had been designated relative to the I-196 number.

The freeway numbered I-196 is the second in the state to bear the number. Originally to be numbered as part of the I-94 corridor in the state, the Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids freeway was given the I-96 number in the 1950s while another Interstate between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s. The first segment of the current I-196 was opened as I-96 near Benton Harbor in 1962. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963 which reversed the two numbers, and the subsequent segments of freeway opened northward to Holland and from Grand Rapids westward under the current number. The gap between Holland and Grandville was filled in the 1970s, and a section of freeway that runs through downtown Grand Rapids was rebuilt as a wider freeway in 2010.

==Route description==
Like other state highways in Michigan, I-196 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 77,500 vehicles used the highway daily between Lane Avenue and US 131 in Grand Rapids and 12,778 vehicles did so each day north of the split with US 31 near Holland. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-196 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the &quot;Gerald R. Ford Freeway&quot; to honor the 38th President of the United States. The original legislation from 1974 extended that name to the full length of the freeway, but when the various memorial highway names were re-codified in 2001, the name was not applied to the Berrien County segment. From the junction with M-63 north to the split with US 31 except for the section that connects the ends of the South Haven business loop, the freeway is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT), a tourist route that follows Lake Michigan.

===Benton Harbor to Holland===
The freeway starts northeast of Benton Harbor at exit 34 on I-94 in Benton Charter Township in Berrien County. At the trumpet interchange, I-196 runs north from I-94 and passes to the west of the Point O&#x27;Woods Golf &amp; Country Club. US 31 joins I-196 from the southwest and runs concurrently with I-196 as the freeway passes through farm fields in southwestern Michigan. The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the Paw Paw River. Past the river, the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland. At the community of Lake Michigan Beach, I-196/US 31 meets the northern terminus of M-63 at exit 7, and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time. North of this interchange, the freeway parallels A-2, a county road that follows the Blue Star Highway, the former route of US 31.
A bit further north, I-196/US 31 crosses into Van Buren County and assumes the Gerald R. Ford Freeway name. The inland side of the freeway is forested while the lakeward side is predominantly either forest or fields. As it approaches South Haven, the freeway passes near the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station and Van Buren State Park. North of the power plant and park, the freeway turns farther inland to bypass the city of South Haven. There is an interchange on the south side of town that provides access to Business Loop I-196 (BL I-196) and M-140. The freeway crosses over M-43 without an interchange and then intersects the other end of the business loop about later. It crosses the Black River near the Van Buren–Allegan county line.

In Allegan County, I-196/US 31 passes a pair of golf courses and continues northward through farm fields. Near the community of Glenn, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. They trade places again when I-196/US 31 turns northeasterly on the south side of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US 31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.

===Holland to Grand Rapids===
On the south side of Holland, the two highways split apart; US 31 separates from I-196 at a partial interchange near the West Michigan Regional Airport (formerly the Tulip City Airport). At this interchange, northbound traffic may follow a left exit to continue on the BL I-196/US 31 freeway or continue along I-196 which turns more eastward; the LMCT departs I-196 at this point as well. Signage along I-196 changes after this interchange. Up to this point, it had been signed north–south, but from the US 31 split onward, the directions are now signed east–west. The freeway passes to the south side of the airport, and it crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and used by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pere Marquette&quot; train before curving northeasterly through the interchange with M-40. The freeway crosses into Ottawa County south of the Macatawa River before meeting the other two interchanges for Holland, the second of which is the northern end of the business loop in Zeeland.
Continuing past Zeeland, I-196 runs more east-northeasterly as it parallels M-121 (Chicago Drive). The freeway passes to the south side of Hudsonville and intersects A-37. About past Hudsonville, the trunkline has an interchange with M-6, a freeway that runs along the south side of the Grand Rapids area. Just past this interchange, the freeway crosses into Kent County at the Kenowa Avenue overpass. Now in the city of Grandville, I-196 turns northward to run parallel to the county line. The freeway has an interchange for 44th Street, which provides access to the RiverTown Crossings mall and other retail and restaurant establishments in the area. At exit 69, I-196 crosses Chicago Drive and the rail line and turns northeasterly next to Jenison, an unincorporated community opposite the Kent–Ottawa county line. The Ford Freeway name is now prominently used on the freeway signage as I-196 follows a section of the Grand River. Past the interchange for M-11 (28th Street), the freeway crosses into the suburb of Wyoming.

In Wyoming, the freeway runs along the river, passing Millennium Park on the opposite banks in Walker and Hopewell Indian Mounds Park on the near banks. To the south of the freeway, the business spur for Wyoming and Grand Rapids departs to follow Chicago Drive near an industrial area. After the interchange for Market Avenue, I-196 crosses the Grand River and enters the city of Grand Rapids. The freeway meanders northward past the transmission antennas for radio stations WJRW and WYHA and around the west side of the John Ball Zoological Garden. The trunkline has an interchange with M-45 (Lake Michigan Drive) on the north side of the zoo before I-196 runs downhill turning eastward.
At the bottom of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through residential neighborhoods on the city&#x27;s west side as it approaches the interchange with US 131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the crisscrossing carriageways of US 131&#x27;s freeway. I-196 crosses the river on the opposite side of the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.

As the freeway runs eastward, it passes the area of Grand Rapids known as the &quot;Medical Mile&quot;, a district anchored by the Van Andel Institute, Helen DeVos Children&#x27;s Hospital, a campus of the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the Butterworth Hospital campus of Corewell Health. The Ford Freeway jogs slightly to the northeast as it crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad between College and Eastern avenues. It then passes to the south of the office buildings that house the Kent County Health Department, the Sheriff&#x27;s Department and the animal shelter. A little over a mile and a quarter (2.0 km) east of those offices, I-196 meets its parent highway, I-96 on the east side of the city. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Ford Freeway and I-196.

==History==

===Previous designation===

In the first tentative Interstate numbering plans, the freeways in Michigan now numbered I-96 and I-196 were supposed to be part of the I-94 corridor, and the freeway between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was to be I-94N. Later, the initial approvals by the federal government routed I-96 from Benton Harbor north to Grand Rapids and then east to Detroit, and I-196 was the spur route from Grand Rapids to Muskegon. The first segment of freeway built was a relocated section of US 16 near Coopersville and Marne. The freeway opened at the end of 1957 or in early 1958, and the first markers for I-196 were erected in 1959. The full Grand Rapids–Muskegon I-196 freeway was completed and opened to traffic in December 1962, connecting to an I-96 freeway that led east toward Lansing; the US 16 corridor was a continuous freeway with two different Interstate designations. Before the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor segment was completed, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), predecessor to the modern MDOT, petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids. Permission for this switch was granted in 1963, and the signs were changed in January 1964. Consideration was also made to name the Grand Rapids–Benton Harbor freeway I-67. The previously completed I-196 was redesignated as an extension of I-96, and the completed freeway segments southwest of Grand Rapids were redesignated I-196; I-67 was rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials.

===Current designation===

In August 1963, a section of freeway along US 31 was opened between I-94 and South Haven. This section was originally designated as part of I-96/US 31. After the designation switch later in 1963, an additional section was opened from South Haven to Holland as I-196. An additional section of freeway was opened between Grandville through downtown Grand Rapids to meet I-96 at the end of 1964. M-21 was moved to the freeway from its previous surface-street routing. The final link in the freeway was completed in November 1974 along the Holland–Grandville segment, completing I-196 for a second time. At the same time, M-21 was removed from the freeway, truncating that highway designation to end in Grand Rapids.

In 2009, access to Jenison was improved by the addition of a partial interchange with Baldwin Street. The section through downtown Grand Rapids east of the Grand River was rebuilt during 2010 in a project MDOT dubbed the &quot;Fix on I-196&quot;. The project added a third travel lane in each direction with weave-merge lanes between interchanges and rebuilt several of the overpasses in the area. In 2016, the sections of I-196 that run concurrently with US 31 north of the M-63 interchange, except between the ends of the business loop at South Haven were designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.
==Exit list==











==Business routes==
There are currently three business loops (BL I-196) and one business spur (BS I-196) along I-196. A BS I-196 in Muskegon was designated along what is now Bus. US 31 before the Muskegon–Grand Rapids freeway was redesignated I-96.

===South Haven===

Business Loop I-196 (BL I-196) is a loop that runs in South Haven for . The loop begins at exit 18 on I-196/US 31 and runs due north along La Grange Street. It then turns onto Phillips Street and merges into Broadway Street. BL I-196 follows Phoenix Street eastward where the trunkline ends at exit 20 on I-196. The entire length is a part of the LMCT. A bypass of downtown was built during World War II; the former route of US 31 through downtown was designated Bus. US 31 at that time. When I-196 was built outside of South Haven in 1963, the former US 31 bypass was redesignated BL I-196. In 1972, the loop was shifted to follow the pre-war routing through downtown. In 2016, all of the business loop was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.

Major intersections



===Holland===

Business Loop I-196 (BL I-196) is a loop that runs for in Holland and Zeeland. The loop starts at a connection with I-196/US 31 at exit 44 and continues concurrently along the freeway into Holland. BL I-196/US 31 has an interchange for A-2 (Blue Star Highway) and Washington Avenue before the freeway ends in the southern reaches of Holland. The trunkline then runs as a divided highway northward, bypassing downtown Holland to the east and intersecting M-40. Northeast of downtown, BL I-196 leaves US 31 and the LMCT at an interchange to follow an expressway along the route of Chicago Drive. The loop follows this expressway through Zeeland and back out to I-196 at exit 55.

The loop was created in 1974 when I-196 was completed south of the city of Holland. From that point, the old route of M-21 inside the cities to US 31 was redesignated as a business loop of I-196 with the state taking control of Washington Avenue to the downtown area. Then from downtown looping back up to Chicago Drive, the business loop used the old M-21. Along Washington Avenue and Chicago Drive between junctions with US 31, the highway bore a concurrent Bus. US 31 designation. The concurrent trunkline inside the downtown area of Holland was transferred to the City of Holland in 2005, and BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US 31. In 2016, the section of the business loop that runs concurrently with US 31 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.

===Wyoming===
Business Spur I-196 (BS I-196) is a spur that serves the Godfrey–Lee area of Wyoming, Michigan. It starts at the partial interchange for exit 72 on I-196 and then moves onto the surface street Chicago Drive for the majority of the distance in Wyoming, running through an industrial area. After about a mile (1.6 km), the highway runs through residential areas. Upon reaching the Grand Rapids city limits, it ends at Cesar E Chavez Avenue. Its total length is . It can be accessed only from eastbound I-196 on the western end.

In 1953, the state highway department completed enough of the Grand Rapids beltline to reroute M-21 to it. The former routing of M-21 was then redesignated Bus. M-21. With the completion of I-196 from Holland to Grand Rapids in 1974, the highway was truncated to run between I-196 and US 131 and renamed BS I-196. In December 2017, it was shortened further to end at the Grand Rapids city limits at the intersection between Chicago Drive and Clyde Park Avenue when the remainder of the trunkline along Grandville Avenue and Franklin Street was turned over to local control.

<doc id="697990" wikidata="Q1049253" url="?curid=697990" title="Cel shading">
<text>Cel shading or toon shading is a type of non-photorealistic rendering designed to make 3D computer graphics appear to be flat by using less shading color instead of a shade gradient or tints and shades. A cel shader is often used to mimic the style of a comic book or cartoon and/or give the render a characteristic paper-like texture. There are similar techniques that can make an image look like a sketch, an oil painting or an ink painting. The name comes from &quot;cels&quot; (short for celluloid), clear sheets of acetate which are painted on for use in traditional 2D animation.

== Basic process ==

The cel-shading process starts with a typical 3D model. Where cel-shading differs from conventional rendering is in its non-photorealistic shading algorithm. Conventional smooth lighting values are calculated for each pixel and then quantized to a small number of discrete shades to create the characteristic &quot;flat look&quot;, where the shadows and highlights appear as blocks of color rather than being smoothly mixed in a gradient.

==Outlines==
===Wireframe method===
Black ink outlines and contour lines can be created using a variety of methods. One popular method is to first render a black outline, slightly larger than the object itself. Back-face culling is inverted and the back-facing triangles are drawn in black. To dilate the silhouette, these back-faces may be drawn in wireframe multiple times with slight changes in translation. Alternatively, back-faces may be rendered solid-filled, with their vertices translated along their vertex normals in a vertex shader. After drawing the outline, back-face culling is set back to normal to draw the shading and optional textures of the object. Finally, the image is composited via Z-buffering, as the back-faces always lie deeper in the scene than the front-faces. The result is that the object is drawn with a black outline and interior contour lines. The term &quot;cel-shading&quot; is popularly used to refer to the application of this &quot;ink&quot; outlining process in animation and games, although originally the term referred to the flat shading technique regardless of whether the outline was applied.

The Utah teapot rendered using cel shading:

# The back faces are drawn with thick lines
# The object faces are drawn using a single color
# Shading is applied

Steps 2 and 3 can be combined using multitexturing (part of texture mapping).

=== Edge-detection method ===

== In video games ==
The Sega Dreamcast title &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, which was revealed at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show, drew media attention for its cel-shaded style. It used cel-shading for its characters and its vibrant visual style has had a lasting influence on the use of cel-shading in video games. Since the early 2000s, many notable video games have made use of this style, such as &quot;Cel Damage&quot; (2001), &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; (2002) and &quot;Ōkami&quot; (2006).

Cel shading, in contrast to other visual styles such as photorealism, is often used to lend a more artistic or fantastical element to a video game&#x27;s environment. In developing &quot;Ōkami&quot;, director Hideki Kamiya described his vision for the game&#x27;s graphics: &quot;I wanted to create a game with the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside... to make a world that was glistening and beautiful.&quot; Producer Atsushi Inaba recalls in a 2004 interview that Clover Studios had &quot;abandoned the realistic style&quot; for &quot;Ōkami&quot; as they became inspired by traditional Japanese art.

Game studios might choose a style such as cel shading in their development for reasons beyond artistic vision. Cel shaded graphics are usually simple in visual information, which can be useful in some applications. In the case of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot;, developer Satoru Takizawa states that using this style allowed to &quot;represent the mechanisms and objects for puzzles [in &quot;The Wind Waker&quot;] in a more easy-to-understand way.&quot; Takizawa also argues that photorealistic graphics, in contrast, would have &quot;had the adverse effect of making information difficult to represent game-wise.&quot;

<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, the smash product of two pointed spaces (i.e. topological spaces with distinguished basepoints) and is the quotient of the product space under the identifications for all in and in . The smash product is itself a pointed space, with basepoint being the equivalence class of The smash product is usually denoted or . The smash product depends on the choice of basepoints (unless both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are homogeneous).

One can think of and as sitting inside as the subspaces } and These subspaces intersect at a single point: the basepoint of So the union of these subspaces can be identified with the wedge sum formula_1. In particular, in is identified with in formula_2, ditto for } and . In formula_2, subspaces and intersect in the single point formula_4. The smash product is then the quotient
:formula_5

The smash product shows up in homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology. In homotopy theory, one often works with a different category of spaces than the category of all topological spaces. In some of these categories the definition of the smash product must be modified slightly. For example, the smash product of two CW complexes is a CW complex if one uses the product of CW complexes in the definition rather than the product topology. Similar modifications are necessary in other categories.

==Examples==

* The smash product of any pointed space &quot;X&quot; with a 0-sphere (a discrete space with two points) is homeomorphic to &quot;X&quot;.
* The smash product of two circles is a quotient of the torus homeomorphic to the 2-sphere.
* More generally, the smash product of two spheres &quot;S&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; is homeomorphic to the sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;.
* The smash product of a space &quot;X&quot; with a circle is homeomorphic to the reduced suspension of &quot;X&quot;: formula_6
* The &quot;k&quot;-fold iterated reduced suspension of &quot;X&quot; is homeomorphic to the smash product of &quot;X&quot; and a &quot;k&quot;-sphere formula_7
* In domain theory, taking the product of two domains (so that the product is strict on its arguments).

==As a symmetric monoidal product==
For any pointed spaces &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; in an appropriate &quot;convenient&quot; category (e.g., that of compactly generated spaces), there are natural (basepoint preserving) homeomorphisms
:formula_8
However, for the naive category of pointed spaces, this fails, as shown by the counterexample formula_9 and formula_10 found by Dieter Puppe. A proof due to Kathleen Lewis that Puppe&#x27;s counterexample is indeed a counterexample can be found in the book of Johann Sigurdsson and J. Peter May.

These isomorphisms make the appropriate category of pointed spaces into a symmetric monoidal category with the smash product as the monoidal product and the pointed 0-sphere (a two-point discrete space) as the unit object. One can therefore think of the smash product as a kind of tensor product in an appropriate category of pointed spaces.

==Adjoint relationship==
Adjoint functors make the analogy between the tensor product and the smash product more precise. In the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the tensor functor formula_11 is left adjoint to the internal Hom functor formula_12, so that
:formula_13
In the category of pointed spaces, the smash product plays the role of the tensor product in this formula: if formula_14 are compact Hausdorff then we have an adjunction
:formula_15

where formula_16 denotes continuous maps that send basepoint to basepoint, and formula_17 carries the compact-open topology.

In particular, taking formula_18 to be the unit circle formula_19, we see that the reduced suspension functor formula_20 is left adjoint to the loop space functor formula_21:
:formula_22

<text>Pieter-Dirk Uys (; born 28 September 1945) is a South African performer, author, satirist, and social activist. One of his best known roles is as Evita Bezuidenhout, an Afrikaner socialite.

==Background and early life==
Uys was born in Cape Town on 28 September 1945, to Hannes Uys, a Calvinist Afrikaner father, and Helga Bassel, a Berlin-born Jewish mother. Hannes Uys, a fourth-generation South African of Dutch and Belgian Huguenot stock, was a musician and organist in his local church. Bassel was a German concert pianist, whom the Nazis expelled from the Reichsmusikkammer in 1935 as part of their campaign to root out Jewish artists. She later escaped to South Africa and managed to take her grand piano with her, with which she taught her daughter, Tessa Uys (b. 1948), now a concert pianist based in London. Bassel spoke little about her Jewish past to her children. It was only after her suicide that they discovered she was Jewish. Uys and his sister had an NG Kerk upbringing and their mother encouraged them to embrace Afrikaner culture.

==Career==
Uys received a B.A. from the University of Cape Town where he began his dramatic career as an actor under the tutelage of Rosalie van der Gught, Mavis Taylor and Robert Mohr, among others. His performances at this time included roles in &quot;Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks,&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;. He later went on to study at the London Film School during the early 1970s. It was in one of his student films, an advertisement for milk, that he performed in drag for the first time (as a milkmaid). He then began a period in his dramatic career as a serious playwright. Several of his plays were performed at the Space Theatre, Cape Town, and his 1979 play &quot;Paradise is Closing Down&quot; was performed in London, at the Edinburgh Festival (co-produced by William Burdett-Coutts), and later produced for Granada Television in 1981. He subsequently switched to performing one-man revues at the height of the Apartheid era. His show &quot;Adapt or Dye&quot; started at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg in 1981 and ran for 280 performances to sellout crowds. He followed this up with &quot;Farce about Uys: A Legal Assembly in Two Riotous Acts&quot;, quickly selling out tickets for its initial five-week run.

Uys is particularly well known for his character &quot;Evita Bezuidenhout&quot; (also known as Evita, Afrikaans for &quot;Auntie Evita&quot;), a white Afrikaner socialite and self-proclaimed political activist. The character was inspired by Australian comedian Barry Humphries&#x27;s character Dame Edna Everage. Evita is the former ambassadress of Bapetikosweti – a fictitious Bantustan or black homeland located outside her home in the affluent, formerly whites-only suburbs of Johannesburg. Evita Bezuidenhout is named in honour of Eva Perón. Under Apartheid, Uys used the medium of humour and comedy to criticise and expose the absurdity of the South African government&#x27;s racial policies. Much of his work was not censored, indicating a tacit approval of his views by many members of the ruling party, who were not so bold as to openly admit mistakes and criticise the policies themselves. For many years Uys lampooned the South African regime and its leaders, as well as the sometimes hypocritical attitudes of white liberals. One of his characters, a &quot;kugel&quot; (social climbing Jewish woman) once said, &quot;There are two things wrong with South Africa: one&#x27;s apartheid and the other&#x27;s black people&quot;. This was later erroneously attributed to Uys himself.

Following South Africa&#x27;s first non-racial elections in 1994, Uys starred in a TV series, &quot;Funigalore&quot;, in which Evita interviewed Nelson Mandela and other prominent politicians of the day. In the theatre, Uys/Evita&#x27;s performances include &quot;You ANC Nothing Yet&quot;. He and his character are known for their tireless work in the frontline of HIV/AIDS activism and education. He is currently involved in teaching AIDS awareness to children and education in the use of condoms, travelling to schools all over South Africa to spread the message of safe, responsible sex. Uys also serves on the board of directors for the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, a non-profit organisation founded to provide treatment for and conduct research relating to HIV. 

Uys converted the old, disused railway station at Darling, where he lives, into a cabaret venue called &quot;Evita se Perron&quot; (Perron is Afrikaans for &quot;station platform&quot;) and performs there regularly. During 2004, Pieter-Dirk Uys took part in a Carte Blanche story, dealing with genetics and unlocking the mysteries of race and ethnicity, entitled &quot;So, Where Do We Come From?&quot;. Uys discovered that he has Central African heritage from his mother&#x27;s side. Uys received the Special Teddy Award 2011 at the Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) for his commitment to AIDS education at South African schools and for his on-stage alter ego, Evita Bezuidenhout. An independent jury presents the &quot;Teddy Award&quot; to individuals for lifetime achievements for films with LGBT (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender) topics.

<text>In scientific visualization and computer graphics, volume rendering is a set of techniques used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set, typically a 3D scalar field.

A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a CT, MRI, or MicroCT scanner. 
Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice for each millimeter of depth) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern.
This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or voxel represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

To render a 2D projection of the 3D data set, one first needs to define a camera in space relative to the volume. Also, one needs to define the opacity and color of every voxel.
This is usually defined using an RGBA (for red, green, blue, alpha) transfer function that defines the RGBA value for every possible voxel value.

For example, a volume may be viewed by extracting isosurfaces (surfaces of equal values) from the volume and rendering them as polygonal meshes or by rendering the volume directly as a block of data. The marching cubes algorithm is a common technique for extracting an isosurface from volume data. Direct volume rendering is a computationally intensive task that may be performed in several ways.

Another method of volume rendering is Ray marching.

==Scope==

Volume rendering is distinguished from thin slice tomography presentations, and is also generally distinguished from projections of 3D models, including maximum intensity projection. Still, technically, all volume renderings become projections when viewed on a 2-dimensional display, making the distinction between projections and volume renderings a bit vague. Nevertheless, the epitomes of volume rendering models feature a mix of for example coloring and shading in order to create realistic and/or observable representations.

==Direct volume rendering==
A direct volume renderer requires every sample value to be mapped to opacity and a color. This is done with a &quot;transfer function&quot; which can be a simple ramp, a piecewise linear function or an arbitrary table. Once converted to an RGBA color model (for red, green, blue, alpha) value, the composed RGBA result is projected on the corresponding pixel of the frame buffer. The way this is done depends on the rendering technique.

A combination of these techniques is possible. For instance, a shear warp implementation could use texturing hardware to draw the aligned slices in the off-screen buffer.

===Volume ray casting===
The technique of volume ray casting can be derived directly from the rendering equation. It provides results of very high quality, usually considered to provide the best image quality. Volume ray casting is classified as image based volume rendering technique, as the computation emanates from the output image, not the input volume data as is the case with object based techniques. In this technique, a ray is generated for each desired image pixel. Using a simple camera model, the ray starts at the center of projection of the camera (usually the eye point) and passes through the image pixel on the imaginary image plane floating in between the camera and the volume to be rendered. The ray is clipped by the boundaries of the volume in order to save time. Then the ray is sampled at regular or adaptive intervals throughout the volume. The data is interpolated at each sample point, the transfer function applied to form an RGBA sample, the sample is composited onto the accumulated RGBA of the ray, and the process repeated until the ray exits the volume. The RGBA color is converted to an RGB color and deposited in the corresponding image pixel. The process is repeated for every pixel on the screen to form the completed image.

===Splatting===

This is a technique which trades quality for speed. Here, every volume element is splatted, as Lee Westover said, like a snow ball, on to the viewing surface in back to front order. These splats are rendered as disks whose properties (color and transparency) vary diametrically in normal (Gaussian) manner. Flat disks and those with other kinds of property distribution are also used depending on the application.

===Shear warp===
The shear warp approach to volume rendering was developed by Cameron and Undrill, popularized by Philippe Lacroute and Marc Levoy. In this technique, the viewing transformation is transformed such that the nearest face of the volume becomes axis aligned with an off-screen image data buffer with a fixed scale of voxels to pixels. The volume is then rendered into this buffer using the far more favorable memory alignment and fixed scaling and blending factors. Once all slices of the volume have been rendered, the buffer is then warped into the desired orientation and scaled in the displayed image.

This technique is relatively fast in software at the cost of less accurate sampling and potentially worse image quality compared to ray casting. There is memory overhead for storing multiple copies of the volume, for the ability to have near axis aligned volumes. This overhead can be mitigated using run length encoding.

===Texture-based volume rendering===

Many 3D graphics systems use texture mapping to apply images, or textures, to geometric objects. Commodity PC graphics cards are fast at texturing and can efficiently render slices of a 3D volume, with real time interaction capabilities. Workstation GPUs are even faster, and are the basis for much of the production volume visualization used in medical imaging, oil and gas, and other markets (2007). In earlier years, dedicated 3D texture mapping systems were used on graphics systems such as Silicon Graphics InfiniteReality, HP Visualize FX graphics accelerator, and others. This technique was first described by Bill Hibbard and Dave Santek.

These slices can either be aligned with the volume and rendered at an angle to the viewer, or aligned with the viewing plane and sampled from unaligned slices through the volume. Graphics hardware support for 3D textures is needed for the second technique.

Volume aligned texturing produces images of reasonable quality, though there is often a noticeable transition when the volume is rotated.

==Hardware-accelerated volume rendering==
Due to the extremely parallel nature of direct volume rendering, special purpose volume rendering hardware was a rich research topic before GPU volume rendering became fast enough. The most widely cited technology was the VolumePro real-time ray-casting system, developed by Hanspeter Pfister and scientists at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, which used high memory bandwidth and brute force to render using the ray casting algorithm. The technology was transferred to TeraRecon, Inc. and two generations of ASICs were produced and sold. The VP1000 was released in 2002 and the VP2000 in 2007.

Pixel shaders are able to read and write randomly from video memory and perform some basic mathematical and logical calculations. These SIMD processors were used to perform general calculations such as rendering polygons and signal processing. In recent GPU generations, the pixel shaders now are able to function as MIMD processors (now able to independently branch) utilizing up to 1 GB of texture memory with floating point formats. With such power, virtually any algorithm with steps that can be performed in parallel, such as volume ray casting or tomographic reconstruction, can be performed with tremendous acceleration. The programmable pixel shaders can be used to simulate variations in the characteristics of lighting, shadow, reflection, emissive color and so forth. Such simulations can be written using high level shading languages.

==Optimization techniques==
The primary goal of optimization is to skip as much of the volume as possible. A typical medical data set can be 1 GB in size. To render that at 30 frame/s requires an extremely fast memory bus. Skipping voxels means less information needs to be processed.

===Empty space skipping===
Often, a volume rendering system will have a system for identifying regions of the volume containing no visible material. This information can be used to avoid rendering these transparent regions.

===Early ray termination===
This is a technique used when the volume is rendered in front to back order. For a ray through a pixel, once sufficient dense material has been encountered, further samples will make no significant contribution to the pixel and so may be neglected.

===Octree and BSP space subdivision===
The use of hierarchical structures such as octree and BSP-tree could be very helpful for both compression of volume data and speed optimization of volumetric ray casting process.

===Volume segmentation===

Image segmentation is a manual or automatic procedure that can be used to section out large portions of the volume that one considers uninteresting before rendering, the amount of calculations that have to be made by ray casting or texture blending can be significantly reduced. This reduction can be as much as from O(n) to O(log n) for n sequentially indexed voxels. Volume segmentation also has significant performance benefits for other ray tracing algorithms. Volume segmentation can subsequently be used to highlight or expose structures of interest.

===Multiple and adaptive resolution representation===
By representing less interesting regions of the volume in a coarser resolution, the data input overhead can be reduced. On closer observation, the data in these regions can be populated either by reading from memory or disk, or by interpolation. The coarser resolution volume is resampled to a smaller size in the same way as a 2D mipmap image is created from the original. These smaller volume are also used by themselves while rotating the volume to a new orientation.

===Pre-integrated volume rendering===
Pre-integrated volume rendering is a method that can reduce sampling artifacts by pre-computing much of the required data. It is especially useful in hardware-accelerated applications because it improves quality without a large performance impact. Unlike most other optimizations, this does not skip voxels. Rather it reduces the number of samples needed to accurately display a region of voxels. The idea is to render the intervals between the samples instead of the samples themselves. This technique captures rapidly changing material, for example the transition from muscle to bone with much less computation.

===Image-based meshing===
Image-based meshing is the automated process of creating computer models from 3D image data (such as MRI, CT, Industrial CT or microtomography) for computational analysis and design, e.g. CAD, CFD, and FEA.

===Temporal reuse of voxels===
For a complete display view, only one voxel per pixel (the front one) is required to be shown (although more can be used for smoothing the image), if animation is needed, the front voxels to be shown can be cached and their location relative to the camera can be recalculated as it moves. Where display voxels become too far apart to cover all the pixels, new front voxels can be found by ray casting or similar, and where two voxels are in one pixel, the front one can be kept.

<doc id="698027" wikidata="Q2825907" url="?curid=698027" title="Virginius Affair">
<text>The &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair was a diplomatic dispute that occurred from October 1873 to February 1875 between the United States, Great Britain, and Spain (then in control of Cuba) during the Ten Years&#x27; War. &quot;Virginius&quot; was a fast American ship hired by Cuban insurrectionists to land men and munitions in Cuba to attack the Spanish regime, in support of the Ten-Year revolutionary war. It was captured by the Spanish, who wanted to try the men onboard (many of whom were American and British citizens) as pirates and execute them. The Spanish executed 53 men in Santiago de Cuba, but stopped when the British government intervened.

Throughout the ordeal, there was loose talk that the US might declare war on Spain. During the lengthy negotiations, the Spanish government underwent several leadership changes. US consul Caleb Cushing ended the episode by negotiating $80,000 in reparations to be paid to the families of the executed Americans. The Spanish government compensated British families through negotiation before American compensation. The incident was remarkable for the use of international diplomacy for a peaceful settlement implemented by US Secretary of State Hamilton Fish rather than opting for a costly war between the United States and Spain. The &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair started a resurgence in the US Navy in the late 19th century. Until then its fleet had been inferior to the warships of Spain.

== Ten Years&#x27; War ==
After the American Civil War, the island country of Cuba under Spanish rule was one of the few Western Hemisphere countries where slavery remained legal and was widely practiced. On October 10, 1868, a revolution broke out, known as the Ten Years&#x27; War, by Cuban landowners, led by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes. The Spanish, led initially by Francisco Lersundi, used the military to suppress the rebellion. In 1870, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish persuaded President Grant not to recognize Cuban belligerency, and the United States maintained an unstable peace with Spain.

As the Cuban war continued, an international patriotic insurgency began to arise in support of the Cuban rebellion; war bonds were sold in the US to support the Cuban resistance. One of the US Cuban patriots was John F. Patterson, who bought a former Confederate steamer, &quot;Virgin&quot;, at the Washington Navy Yard, renaming her &quot;Virginius&quot;. The legality of Patterson&#x27;s purchase of &quot;Virginius&quot; would later come to national and international attention. The Cuban rebellion ended in an 1878 armistice after Spanish general Arsenio Martínez-Campos pardoned all Cuban rebels.

==&quot;Virginius&quot;==
&quot;Virginius&quot; was a small, high-speed side-wheel steamer built to serve as a blockade runner between Havana and Mobile, Alabama, for the Confederacy during the Civil War. Originally built as &quot;Virgin&quot; by Aitken &amp; Mansel of Whiteinch, Glasgow in 1864, she became a prize of the United States when captured on April 12, 1865. In August 1870, &quot;Virginius&quot; was purchased by an American, John F. Patterson, acting secretly as an agent for Cuban insurgent Manuel de Quesada and two US citizens, Marshall O. Roberts and J.K. Roberts. The ship was originally captained by Francis Sheppherd. Both Patterson and Shepphard immediately registered the ship in the New York Custom House, having paid $2,000 to be bonded. However, no sureties were listed. Patterson took a required oath attesting that he was the sole owner of &quot;Virginius&quot;. The secret purpose of purchasing &quot;Virginius&quot; was to transport men, munitions, and supplies to aid the Cuban rebellion. For three years, the ship aided the Cuban rebellion; it was protected by US naval ships, including and . The Spanish said that it was an outlaw ship and aggressively sought to capture it.

==Capture, trial, and executions==
Captain Joseph Fry was made the new captain of &quot;Virginius&quot; in October 1873. Fry had served in the US Navy for 15 years before joining the Confederacy during the Civil War. Fry was promoted to commodore in the Confederate Navy. However, after that position disappeared after the U.S. victory in 1865, Fry was underemployed. In 1873 he took the job as captain of &quot;Virginius&quot;. &quot;Virginius&quot;, moored in Kingston, Jamaica by this time, needed repair, and the boilers were breaking down. As most of the previous crew had deserted, Fry recruited a new crew of 52 American and British men. Many were inexperienced and did not understand that &quot;Virginius&quot; was supporting the Cuban rebellion. Three were very young recruits, no older than 13 years of age. &quot;Virginius&quot; took on 103 native Cuban soldiers that arrived on board a New York steamer. The US Consul at Kingston, Thomas H. Pearne, had warned Fry that he would be shot if captured. However, Fry did not believe the Spanish would shoot a blockade runner. In mid-October, Captain Fry, accompanied by the four principal Cuban patriots, Pedro de Céspedes (brother of Carlos Manuel de Céspedes), Bernabé Varona, Jesús del Sol, and William A.C. Ryan, took &quot;Virginius&quot; to Haiti and loaded the ship with munitions. On October 30, &quot;Virginius&quot; sailed to Comito to pick up more weapons and then, on the same day, started toward Cuba. The Spanish had been warned when &quot;Virginius&quot; left Jamaica and sent out the warship to capture the vessel.

On October 30, 1873 &quot;Tornado&quot; spotted &quot;Virginius&quot; on open water from Cuba and gave chase. &quot;Virginius&quot; was heavily weighted, and the stress from the boilers caused the ship to take on water, significantly slowing any progress. As the chase continued, &quot;Tornado&quot;, a fast warship, fired on &quot;Virginius&quot; several times, damaging the top deck. Captain Fry surrendered &quot;Virginius&quot;, knowing that his ship&#x27;s overworked boilers and leaking hull could not outrun &quot;Tornado&quot; on the open sea. The Spanish quickly boarded and secured the ship, taking the entire crew prisoner and sailing the ship to Santiago de Cuba.

The Spanish immediately ordered the entire crew to be put on trial as pirates. The entire &quot;Virginius&quot; crew, both American and British citizens, as well as the Cuban patriots, were found guilty by a court martial and were sentenced to death. The Spanish ignored the protest of the US vice-consul, who attempted to give American citizens legal aid. On November 4, 1873, the four principal Cuban patriots who accompanied Fry were executed by a firing squad without trial since he had already been condemned as a pirate. After the executions, the British vice-consul at Santiago, concerned that one of the patriots killed, George Washington Ryan, claimed British citizenship, wired Jamaica to receive aid from the Royal Navy to stop further executions. Hearing news of the ship&#x27;s capture and the executions, Altamont de Cordova, a Jamaican resident, was able to get British Commodore A.F.R. de Horsey to send the sloop under Sir Lambton Loraine, 11th Baronet to Santiago to stop further executions. On November 7, an additional 37 crew members, including Captain Fry, were executed by firing squad. The Spanish soldiers decapitated them and trampled their bodies with horses. On November 8, twelve more crew members were executed until finally, both the USS &quot;Wyoming&quot;, under the command of Civil War Naval hero Will Cushing, and HMS &quot;Niobe&quot; reached Santiago. The carnage stopped on the same day that Cushing (and possibly the British Captain Lorraine) threatened local commander Juan N. Burriel that he would bombard Santiago if there were any more executions. 53 were executed at Santiago under Burriel&#x27;s authority. On a lighter note in the midst of the carnage, in an interview that Burriel requested with Sir Lambton Lorraine, he attempted to shake hands with the English captain, who stood straight and exclaimed, &quot;I will not shake hands with a butcher&quot;.

==US public reaction==
The initial press reaction to the capture of &quot;Virginius&quot; was conservative, but as news of executions poured into the nation, certain newspapers became more aggressive in promoting Cuban intervention and war. The &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that if the executions of Americans from &quot;Virginius&quot; were illegal, war needed to be declared. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; asserted that actions of Burriel and the Cuban Volunteers necessitated &quot;the death knell of Spanish power in America.&quot; The &quot;New York Herald&quot; demanded Secretary Hamilton Fish&#x27;s resignation and the recognition by the US of the Cuban belligerency. &quot;The National Republican&quot;, believing the threat of war with Spain to be imminent, encouraged the sale of Cuban bonds. The American public considered the executions a national insult and rallied for intervention. Protest rallies took place across the nation in New Orleans, St. Louis, and Georgia, encouraging intervention in Cuba and vengeance on Spain.

The British Minister to the United States, Sir Edward Thornton, believed the American public was ready for war with Spain. A large rally in New York&#x27;s Steinway Hall on November 17, 1873, led by future Secretary of State William Evarts, took a moderate position, and the meeting adopted a resolution that war would be necessary, yet regrettable, if Spain chose to &quot;consider our defense against savage butchery as a cause of war...&quot;

==US diplomatic response==

===Hamilton Fish and State Department===

On Wednesday, November 5, 1873, the first news from the US Consul-General in Havana, Henry C. Hall, informed the US State Department that &quot;Virginius&quot; had been captured. There was no knowledge that four Cuban patriots had already been killed; Secretary of State Hamilton Fish believed the &quot;Virginius&quot; was just another ship captured aiding the Cuban rebellion. On November 7, Cuba headed the agenda of US President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Cabinet meeting as news came in of the deaths of Ryan and three other patriots. The Cabinet agreed that the executions would be &quot;regarded as an inhuman act not in accordance with the spirit of the civilization of the nineteenth century.&quot; On November 8, Fish met with Spanish minister Don José Polo de Bernabé and discussed the legality of the capture of &quot;Virginius&quot;.

On November 11, Grant&#x27;s Cabinet decided that war with Spain was not desirable, but Cuban intervention was possible. On November 12, five days after the event, Fish received the devastating news that 37 crew members of &quot;Virginius&quot; had been executed. Fish ordered US Minister to Spain Daniel Sickles to protest the executions and demand reparations for any persons considered US citizens who were killed. On November 13, Fish formally protested to Polo and stated that the US had a free hand on Cuba and the &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair. On November 14, Grant&#x27;s cabinet agreed that if US reparation demands were not met, the Spanish legation would be closed. An exaggerated report came into the White House that more crew members had been shot. In reality, twelve crew members had been executed. On November 15, Polo visited Fish and stated that &quot;Virginius&quot; was a pirate ship and that her crew had been a hostile threat to Cuba. Fish, although doubtful of the legality of the ship&#x27;s US ownership, was determined to advocate the nation&#x27;s honor in demanding reparations from Spain.

On the same day, a cable from Fish arrived in Spain for Sickles demanding the return of &quot;Virginius&quot; to the US, the release of the crew that had escaped execution, a salute from Spain to the US flag, punishment for the perpetrators, and reparations for families.

Negotiations in Spain between Sickles and Minister of State José de Carvajal became heated, and progress towards a settlement became unlikely. The Spanish press openly attacked Sickles, the US, and Britain, intending to promote war between the three countries. As the Sickles-Carvajal negotiations broke down, President Emilio Castelar decided to settle the &quot;Virginius&quot; matter through Fish and Polo in Washington.

On Thanksgiving Day, November 27, Polo proposed to Fish that Spain would give up the &quot;Virginius&quot; and the remaining crew if the US would investigate the legal status of its ownership. Both Fish and Grant agreed to Polo&#x27;s offer and that the Spanish salute to the US flag would be dispensed with if &quot;Virginius&quot; was found not to have legal US private citizen ownership. On November 28, Polo and Fish met at the State Department and signed a formal agreement that included the return of &quot;Virginius&quot; and crew and an investigation by both governments of the legal ownership of &quot;Virginius&quot; and any crimes committed by the Spanish Volunteers.

The threat of war between the two countries had been averted through negotiations, but the time and place of the surrender of the &quot;Virginius&quot; and the remaining crew remained undetermined for several days. On December 5, Fish and Polo signed an agreement that &quot;Virginius&quot;, with the US flag flying, would be turned over to the US Navy on December 16 at the port of Bahía Honda. Sickles, having lost the confidence of Grant and Fish, resigned on December 20, 1873. On January 6, 1874, after advice from Fish on a replacement for Sickles, Grant appointed eminent attorney and Spanish scholar Caleb Cushing as Minister to Spain.

===&quot;Virginius&quot; and crew returned===

On December 16, &quot;Virginius&quot;, now in complete disrepair and taking on water, was towed out to open sea with the US flag flying to be turned over to the US Navy. US Captain W.D. Whiting on board agreed with Spanish Commander Manuel de la Cámara to turn over &quot;Virginius&quot; the following day. On December 17, at exactly 9:00 a.m., &quot;Virginius&quot; was formally turned over to the US Navy without incident. The same day, after an investigation, US Attorney General George H. Williams ruled that the US ownership of &quot;Virginius&quot; had been fraudulent and that she had no right to fly the US flag; however, Spain had no right to capture &quot;Virginius&quot; and her crew on the open sea.

At 4:17 a.m., on December 26, while under tow by , &quot;Virginius&quot; foundered off Cape Fear en route to the United States. Her 91 remaining crewmen, who had been held as prisoners under harsh conditions, were handed over to Captain D.L. Braine of &quot;Juanita&quot; and were taken safely to New York City.

===Reparations awarded===

On January 3, 1874, Spanish President Emilio Castelar was voted out of office and replaced by Francisco Serrano. Cushing, who had replaced Sickles as US Consul to Spain, stated that the US had been fortunate that Castelar, a university scholar, had been President of Spain, given that his replacement, Serrano, might have been more apt to go to war over the affair. Cushing&#x27;s primary duty was to get Spanish reparations for &quot;Virginius&quot; family victims and punishment of Burriel for the 53 Santiago executions. Cushing met Serrano in May on June 26, Augusto Ulloa. On July 5, Cushing, now well respected by Spanish authority, wrote to Fish that Spain was ready to make reparations. In October, Cushing was informed that President Castelar had secretly negotiated reparations between Spain and Britain that totaled £7,700, but black British citizen families were given less money. On November 7, Grant and Fish demanded $2,500 from Spain for each US citizen shot, regardless of race.

On November 28, 1874, Fish instructed Cushing that all &quot;Virginius&quot; crew members not considered British would be considered American.

Spanish Consul Antonio Mantilla, Polo&#x27;s replacement, agreed with the reparations. Grant&#x27;s 1875 State of the Union Address announced that reparations were near, quieting anger over the &quot;Virginius&quot; affair. Reparations, however, were put on hold as Spain changed governments on December 28, from a republic back to a monarchy. Alfonso XII became King of Spain on January 11, 1875.

On January 16, Cushings met with the new Spanish state minister Castro, urged settlement before the US Congress adjourned, and noted that reparations would be a minor matter compared to an all-out war between Spain and the US.

Under an agreement of February 7, 1875, signed on March 5, the Spanish government paid the US an indemnity of $80,000 for the execution of the Americans. Burriel&#x27;s Santiago executions were considered illegal by Spain, and President Serrano and King Alfonso condemned him. The case against Burriel was taken up by the Spanish Tribunal of the Navy in June 1876. However, Burriel died on December 24, 1877, before any trial could occur.

In addition to the reparation, a private indemnity in St. Louis was given to Captain Fry&#x27;s financially troubled family, which had been unable to pay rent and had no permanent place to live.

==Aftermath==
When the &quot;Virginius&quot; affair first broke out, a Spanish ironclad—the &quot;Arapiles&quot;—happened to be anchored in New York Harbor for repairs, leading to the uncomfortable realization on the part of the US Navy that it had no ship capable of defeating such a vessel. US Secretary of War George M. Robeson believed a US naval resurgence was necessary. Congress hastily issued contracts to construct five new ironclads and accelerated its repair program for several more. and the four monitors were subsequently built as a result of the &quot;Virginius&quot; war scare. All five vessels would later take part in the Spanish–American War of 1898.

<text>The Fugitives, also known as the Fugitive Poets, is the name given to a group of poets and literary scholars at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who published a literary magazine from 1922 to 1925 called &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. The group, primarily driven by Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Donald Davidson, and Allen Tate, formed a major school of twentieth century poetry in the United States. With it, a major period of modern Southern literature began. Their poetry was formal and featured traditional prosody and concrete imagery often from experiences of the rural south. The group has some overlap with two later movements: Southern Agrarians and New Criticism.

== History ==

 About 1920, a group consisting of some influential teachers of literature at Vanderbilt, a few townies, and some students began meeting on alternate Saturday nights at the home of James Marshall Frank and his brother-in-law Sidney Mttron Hirsch on Whitland Avenue in Nashville. They met as a poetry workshop with no formal connection with the university. After a couple of years, Hirsch felt their poetry was good enough to publish. According to author Louise Cowan, &quot;...half-seriously Alec Stevenson suggested as a title &quot;The Fugitive&quot; after a poem of Hirsch&#x27;s which had been read and discussed at an earlier meeting.&quot; Allen Tate stated, &quot;...a Fugitive was quite simply a Poet: the Wanderer, or even the Wandering Jew, the Outcast, the man who carries the secret wisdom around the world&quot;. They published a small literary magazine, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1922–1925), which showcased their works using noms de plume at first. Although its publication history was brief, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; is considered to be one of the most influential journals in the history of American letters. The Fugitives embodied all the main influences at work in the American Literary Renaissance of the twentieth century.

== Founders ==

The group was noted for the number of its members whose works were recognized with a permanent place in the literary canon. Among the most notable Fugitives were John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Merrill Moore, Donald Davidson, William Ridley Wills, and Robert Penn Warren. Other members include Sidney Mttron Hirsch, Stanley P. Johnson, James M. Frank, Jesse Ely Wills, Walter Clyde Curry, Alec B. Stevenson, William Yandell Elliott, and William Frierson. Two of the members (Warren and Tate) later became United States Poets Laureate.

In &quot;The Briar Patch&quot;, Robert Penn Warren provided a look at the life of an exploited black person in urban America. &quot;The Briar Patch&quot; was a defense both of segregation, and of the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal,&quot; enshrined by &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896). (Warren later recanted the views expressed in &quot;The Briar Patch&quot;.) Less closely associated with the Fugitives were the critic Cleanth Brooks and the poet Laura Riding.

The Fugitives partly overlapped with a later group, also associated with Vanderbilt, called the Agrarians. Some of the Fugitives were part of the latter group. Another group known as the New Critics, was a later school that emerged from the Fugitives, named for Ransom&#x27;s 1941 book, &quot;The New Criticism&quot;.

==Anthologies==

The first comprehensive collection of the Fugitives&#x27; poetry was published by William C. Pratt, Professor of English at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Following that, a second anthology was subsequently created after many of the major works were revised. A third anthology, &quot;The Fugitive poets : Modern Southern Poetry in Perspective&quot; was published in 1991 by Pratt and included additional works by the original poets.

<text>Poenulus, also called The Little Carthaginian or The Little Punic Man, is a Latin comedic play for the early Roman theatre by Titus Maccius Plautus, probably written between 195 and 189 BC. The play is noteworthy for containing text in Carthaginian Punic, spoken by the character Hanno in the fifth act. Another remarkable feature is the sympathetic portrayal of the character of the Carthaginian Hanno at a time when only a few years previously the Romans had suffered huge losses in the 2nd Punic War fought against the Carthaginian general Hannibal (218–202 BC).

The play shows signs of having been reworked, possibly for a second production, since there are two endings.

==Plot==
A young man, Agorastocles, is in love with a girl named Adelphasium, who is a slave belonging to the pimp Lycus. Agorastocles, Adelphasium, and her sister Anterastilis were all stolen as children from Carthage. Agorastocles was purchased by a rich childless man who wanted a son, whereas the girls were sold as slaves to the pimp who intended to make them prostitutes.

Milphio, the long-suffering slave of Agorastocles, attempts to help his master obtain Adelphasium. Their plan is to trick Lycus and get him into legal trouble. Collybiscus, Agorastocles&#x27; farm steward, dresses up as a foreigner and moves into Lycus&#x27; home. Agorastocles and some witnesses then accuse Lycus of harboring his slave and threaten to take him to court. 

At this point Hanno arrives from Carthage, and it is soon revealed that he is the cousin of Agorastocles&#x27; dead parents, as well as the father of the two girls. In the end, the girls are seized from Lycus, who is punished, and the story concludes with a happy family reunion. Hanno gives Agorastocles his blessing to marry his daughter.

The play is set in Calydon, a city in Aetolia in central Greece. The stage set consists of a street with the slave-dealer Lycus&#x27; house on one side, and the young man Agorastocles&#x27; house on the other; between these is a temple of Venus.

==Structure==
The play is symmetrically structured around the trick played on Lycus as follows:
:A – The two girls are in bondage; Agorastocles hopes to marry one
:   B – Lycus&#x27;s unsuccessful sacrifice
:      C – The witnesses arrive; Lyco is tricked; the witnesses depart
:   B – Lycus&#x27;s unsuccessful sacrifice
:A – The girls are freed and one is promised to Agorastocles

However, certain elements, such as the two appearances of the soldier Antamoenides, and the arrival of Hanno, break the symmetry.

==Metrical structure==

Plautus&#x27;s plays are traditionally divided into five acts. However, it is not thought that the act-divisions go back to Plautus&#x27;s time, since no manuscript contains them before the 15th century. Also, the acts themselves do not always match the structure of the plays, which is more clearly shown by the variation in metres.

A common metrical pattern in Plautus&#x27;s plays is that each section begins with iambic senarii (which were spoken without music), then a song () in various metres, and finally each section is rounded off by trochaic septenarii, which were apparently recited or sung to the accompaniment of (a pair of reed pipes). Moore calls this the &quot;ABC succession&quot;, where A = iambic senarii, B = other metres, and C = trochaic septenarii.

Taking iambic senarii as the beginning of a section, and trochaic septenarii as the end, &quot;Poenulus&quot; can be divided into five parts. The overall pattern is as follows:
:ABC, AC, ABC, ABCBC, A... (Plautus&#x27;s ending is lost)

Moore believes that everything from line 1332 (basically the whole of Act 5 scenes 6 and 7) is an interpolation, probably supplied by a producer when the original ending was lost.

The most commonly used metres in this play of 1332 lines are iambic senarii (754 lines) and trochaic septenarii (415 lines). Compared with other Plautus plays, the unaccompanied iambic senarii form an unusually large part (56%) of the play (the average in Plautus being 35%).

===Prologue===
*Prologue (lines 1–128): iambic senarii (128 lines)
::After begging the audience to behave well, an actor explains how two girls and their second cousin, a boy, were separately stolen in Carthage and taken to Greece. The girls are being kept by a slave-owner, but the boy was adopted by a rich man who died and bequeathed him his wealth; this boy has fallen in love with one of the girls. Meanwhile the girls&#x27; father, a Carthaginian, has come to Greece looking for his daughters. The scene is Calydon in central Greece.

===Agorastocles tries to woo Adelphasium===
*Act 1.1 (129–209): iambic senarii (81 lines)
::The young man Agorastocles is speaking to his slave Milphio about his love for Adelphasium. It appears that Agorastocles is fond of Milphio but often beats him. Milphio suggests a trick to force the slave-owner to hand over the girls: they will dress Agorastocles&#x27; farm-manager up as if he were a customer and send him into the procurer&#x27;s house.

*Act 1.2 (210–260): mainly bacchiac (51 lines)
::The two girls come out of the house next door to finish their toilette, and Adelphasium sings of what a lot of trouble and expense it is to maintain a high-class courtesan. Agorastocles and Milphio listen in, making comments aside.

*Act 1.2 cont. (261–409): trochaic septenarii (148 lines)
::Adelphasium&#x27;s sister Anterastilis reminds her that the slave-dealer is waiting for them at the festival of Venus to display them for potential customers, but Adelphasium delays, saying she wishes to avoid the crowds. At this point Agorastocles goes up to Adelphasium and tries to win her over, but she rejects him. He gets Milphio to try on his behalf, then is annoyed at the way Milphio makes sweet-talk to Adelphasium, and beats him. The girls depart for the temple.

===Agorastocles prepares to trick Lycus===
*Act 1.3–Act 2 (410–503): iambic senarii (93 lines)
::Agorastocles promises Milphio his freedom if he can pull off his trick on the slave-dealer. Milphio sends him off to fetch some witnesses. When Agorastocles and Milphio have gone, the procurer Lycus appears, angry because he has wasted money on sacrificing six lambs but without getting good omens. 

::A soldier called Antamoenides (one of Lycus&#x27;s potential customers) arrives. He has been invited for breakfast, and boasts of imaginary battles he has fought.

*Act 3.1–3.2 (504–614): trochaic septenarii (111 lines)
::Agorastocles comes back with his witnesses. He impatiently chides them for coming so slowly. They reply indignantly. He makes them go over the plan once more. Now Milphio comes out from the house with the estate-manager Collybiscus, who is dressed like a wealthy foreigner. The witnesses examine the 300 gold coins he has been given. As they approach the procurer&#x27;s door Lycus comes out.

===Lycus is tricked===
*Act 3.3–3.6 (615–816): iambic senarii (202 lines)
::The witnesses explain that Collybiscus is a rich stranger they met at the harbour, who is looking for a place to stay and enjoy himself. Agorastocles comes out of his house in time to see Collybiscus paying the slave-dealer. After asking the witnesses for advice, he goes to Lycus&#x27;s door. Lycus is just coming out, congratulating himself on the deal. Agorastocles requests him to send over Adelphasium, saying that he has sent a slave carrying the money. In front of the witnesses Lycus falls into the trap of denying that he has seen the slave or the money. Agorastocles fetches Collybiscus from Lycus&#x27;s house for the witnesses to see, but finds that Lycus has run away. Agorastocles, Collybiscus, and the witnesses depart.

*Act 4.1 (817–822): iambic octonarii (4 lines), iambic septenarii (2 lines)
::Milphio comes out into the street, singing how he gets a lot of beating because of his master&#x27;s disturbed mood. He sees Lycus&#x27;s servant Syncerastus coming out of the temple.

*Act 4.2 (823–922): trochaic septenarii (100 lines)
::Milphio overhears Syncerastus complaining to himself about his wretched life working for Lycus. Syncerastus reveals that Lycus&#x27;s temple sacrifice was not propitious. Milphio stops him and offers to help him. Syncerastus reveals that Adelphasium and her sister are actually free-born, captured by pirates in Carthage.

===Hanno finds his daughters===
*Act 5.1–5.3 (940–1173): Punic (10 lines); iambic senarii (222 lines)
::Hanno, the Carthaginian father of the two girls, enters, speaking a prayer in Punic (Phoenician), which he then translates into Latin. He says he is carrying a token of hospitality which gives him to right to stay at the house of Agorastocles. Agorastocles and Milphio come out of their house, and, overheard by Hanno, talk about the two girls stolen from Carthage. Milphio recognises that Hanno and his attendants are Africans and questions him, pretending to understand his answers and inventing fanciful interpretations. Hanno then switches to Latin, to Milphio&#x27;s embarrassment. Agorastocles welcomes Hanno as a fellow Carthaginian. Hanno shows Agorastocles the token and learns that he is the son of his cousin: the scar of a monkey-bite on Agorastocles&#x27; hand confirms his identity. Milphio seizes the opportunity to ask Hanno to help him in his plan. Hanno agrees, suspecting already that the girls are his own lost daughters. The girls&#x27; nurse is summoned from Lycus&#x27;s house and recognises Hanno. Milphio takes Hanno&#x27;s servants inside Agorastocles&#x27; house.

*Act 5.4 (1174–1200): polymetric (mainly anapaestic and iambic) (27 lines)
::Adelphasium and her sister emerge from the temple, singing excitedly about the festival.

*Act 5.4 (cont.) (1201–1225): trochaic septenarii (25 lines)
::The girls also talk of how a soothsayer promised that they would soon be free. Hanno stops them, and insists that they must come with him to a court.

*Act 5.4 (cont.) (1226–1273): iambic septenarii (48 lines)
::The girls are puzzled. Hanno teasingly claims that they must be taken to court because they have stolen his daughters. At last Hanno reveals that he is their father. There is a happy reunion.

*Act 5.4 (cont.)–5.5 (1274–1303): trochaic septenarii (30 lines)
::Hanno says a prayer of thanksgiving. Agorastocles reminds him that he had promised to betroth his eldest daughter to him. 

::The soldier Antamoenides comes out of Lycus&#x27;s house, angry because he has been abandoned there without breakfast. He catches sight of Anterastilis hugging her father and becomes angry.

===The end===
*Act 5.5–5.6 (1304–1331): iambic senarii (26 lines)

::Antamoenides angrily asks Hanno what business he has with her. Agorastocles and Antamoenides are about to start a fight, and Agorastocles summons his slaves, but Anterastilis defuses the situation by explaining. Suddenly they see Lycus returning to his house...

(&quot;The two endings below are probably not by Plautus.&quot;)

*Act 5.6 (end) (1334–1371): iambic senarii 
::Antamoenides and Hanno accost Lycus and both threaten to take him to court. He immediately gives in to their demands. He asks the audience to applaud.

(&quot;Alternative ending&quot;)

*Act 5.7 (1372–1397): iambic senarii
::Lycus overhears Agorastocles explaining to Antamoenides about Hanno&#x27;s daughters; he realises that he must surrender them. He begs Agorastocles for forgiveness and promises to make restitution.

*Act 5.7 (cont.) (1398–1422): trochaic septenarii
::The soldier also demands his money back, and Lycus offers him a new girl. Hanno says that he will not go to court. Agorastocles declares that he will go back to Carthage with Hanno.

<text>Hunters Hill is a suburb of Northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Hunters Hill is located north-west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Municipality of Hunter&#x27;s Hill.

Hunters Hill is situated on a small peninsula that separates the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers. It can be reached by bus or by ferry.

==History==
The area&#x27;s Aboriginal name is &#x27;Mookaboola&#x27; or &#x27;Moocooboola&#x27;, which means &quot;meeting of waters.

Hunters Hill was named after John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales, who was in office between 1795 and 1800.

The area that is now Hunters Hill was settled in 1835. One of the earliest settlers was Mary Reibey, the first female retailer in Sydney. She built a cottage—later known as Fig Tree House—on land that fronted the Lane Cove River; Reiby Street is named after her. During the 1840s, bushrangers and convicts who had escaped from the penal settlement on Cockatoo Island would take refuge in Hunters Hill.

Many of the suburb&#x27;s early houses were built from the local sandstone. A number were built by Frenchman Didier Numa Joubert (1816–1881), who bought of land from Mary Reiby from 1847 and used seventy stonemasons from Italy to construct solid artistic houses. Hunters Hill was proclaimed as a municipality on 5 January 1861. The first Gladesville Bridge constructed in 1881 linked the area to Drummoyne and the southern side of the Parramatta River.
In the early 20th century, there was an industrial area in Hunters Hill. One of the industries was a radium and uranium refinery operating from 1911 to 1915. The concentrated ore was transported over from Radium Hill in South Australia, 100 km west of Broken Hill. At the time, uranium was considered a byproduct, but very small quantities of radium (which had been discovered in 1898) were very valuable. The refinery could produce about 5 milligrammes of radium bromide from a ton of ore, worth £20 per milligramme in 1912. The area is now residential, Nelson Parade, and demands to remove it saw a plan developed to transport it to an old quarry area besides Badgerys Creek that was licensed to receive low level radioactive waste; however all such planning ceased as Badgerys Creek International Airport was decided upon to proceed.

In 2021, following extensive community consultation and research, Hunters Hill Council received planning approval to remediate the site of the Old Radium Hill processing plant and dispose of the contaminated material at a licensed facility in the United States of America.

This approach had strong community support and would resolve a long-standing issue that the private sector created.

Remediation works began in September 2021. In the later stages of the project the waste material from the site was taken to a facility in Western Australia after it was granted a license to operate in 2023.

The excavation and removal of the waste material was completed in August 2024.

The health and safety of the community has been the top priority throughout the works and the transportation of material.

The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization supervised the excavation and packing of the contaminated material into sealed bags and containers before it was transported for disposal.

==Sport==

Hunters Hill Tennis Club is one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia. Early history of the Club is obscure and no records are available showing the origins of the Club, however the Club existed in the 1860s making it one of the oldest operating tennis clubs in Sydney. Early courts were situated in Passy Avenue, Hunters Hill. The first authentic record of the &#x27;Hunters Hill Lawn Tennis Club&#x27; is a copy of the 1894 rules, stating the club was limited to 36 playing members, preference given to residents of Hunters Hill and club colours of Red, Green and Silver. Banjo Patterson is in newspaper records of having played at the club in the 1890s. 
It has had as members State and Interstate Champions, and an Australian entrant at the 1924 Wimbledon Championship, Alan Watt, who reached the fourth round of competition. The club has 5 lawn courts, and is one of the few remaining lawn court clubs in Sydney.

Hunters Hill Rugby Union Football Club was established in 1892 and competes in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union. It has won the Kentwell Cup 8 times and 1st Division club championship 5 times. The second most distinguished club in Subbies, it recently won the Stockdale Cup and Robertson Cup in 2010. The Robertson Cup was named after former Suburban Chairman (1978–80), Brian Robertson, this cup was first won by Port Hacking. After not being contested between 1988–93, the Robertson Cup was revived to become the Colts trophy for second division. The Farrant Cup was named after life member Don Farrant, a long-time supporter of sub-district rugby, Hunters Hill club stalwart Don Farrant presented the Farrant Cup to the MSDRU in 1974. Initially included in an expanded fourth division, it became the award for the Division Three second grade premiership in 1995.
Hunters Hill Rugby Union Football Club is a club that caters for all ages and level of ability, and plays matches at Boronia Park from March through to August.

==Landmarks==
There is a private hospital in Alexandra Street and in High Street, a Jewish nursing home and synagogue named the Sir Moses Montefiore Home. The historic Hunters Hill Town Hall is located in Alexandra Street, close to the historic post office.

The Great North Walk, a walking trail from Sydney to Newcastle, passes through Boronia Park; a large waterfront parkland reserve which contains Aboriginal drawings thought to date back to before the start of the colony.

<text>The Humboldt River is an extensive river drainage system located in north-central Nevada. It extends in a general east-to-west direction from its headwaters in the Jarbidge, Independence, and Ruby Mountains in Elko County, to its terminus in the Humboldt Sink, approximately away in northwest Churchill County. Most estimates put the Humboldt River at long; however, due to the extensive meandering nature of the river, its length may be more closely estimated at . It is located within the Great Basin Watershed and is the third-longest river in the watershed behind the Bear River at and the Sevier River at . The Humboldt River Basin is the largest sub-basin of the Great Basin, encompassing an area of . It is the only major river system wholly contained within the state of Nevada.

It is the only natural transportation artery across the Great Basin and has historically provided a route for westward migration. Additionally, two major railroad routes loosely follow its path. Interstate 80 follows the river&#x27;s course from its source to its mouth. The river was named by John C. Frémont for the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.

==History==

The region of the river in northern Nevada was sparsely inhabited by Numic-speaking people at the time of the arrival of European American settlers. The region was little known by non-indigenous peoples until the arrival of fur trappers in the early 19th century.

The first recorded sighting of the river was on November 9, 1828, by Peter Skene Ogden of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, during his fifth expedition to the Snake Country. Odgen came southward along the Little Humboldt, encountering the main river at the confluence near Winnemucca. Ogden explored the river for several hundred miles, blazing a trail along it and making the first known map of the region. He initially named the river &quot;Unknown River&quot;, due to the source and course of the river still unknown to him, and later &quot;Paul&#x27;s River&quot;, after one of his trappers who died on the expedition and was buried on the river bank. He later changed it again to &quot;Mary&#x27;s River,&quot; named after the Native American wife of one of his trappers, which later somehow became &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s River&quot;. However, in 1829 he suggested that &quot;Swampy River&quot; best described the course he had traversed. In 1833 the Bonneville–Walker fur party explored the river, naming it &quot;Barren River&quot;. Washington Irving&#x27;s 1837 book describing the Bonneville expedition called it &quot;Ogden&#x27;s River&quot;, the name used by many early travelers. By the early 1840s, the trail along the river was being used by settlers going west to California. The river provided drinkable water to earlier travelers on foot, but later emigrants using wagons required the significant riparian vegetation along its length as forage for their draft animals.

In 1841, the river (then known as Mary&#x27;s River) first became the route of the California Trail with the Bartleson–Bidwell Party, later becoming the primary land route for migrants to the California gold fields. In 1845 the river was explored by John C. Frémont, who made a thorough map of the region and gave the river its current name. In 1869 the river was used as part of the route of the Central Pacific segment of the Transcontinental Railroad.

In the 20th century, the valley of the river became the route for U.S. Route 40, later replaced by Interstate 80. In the latter part of the 20th century, about 45,000 people lived within of the river, roughly a third of the population at that time of the State of Nevada outside of Western Nevada and Southern Nevada, before the rapid 21st-century growth of Southern Nevada changed these population figures.

==Watershed and course==
The Humboldt River can be divided geographically into the upper, middle, and lower divisions based on Palisade Canyon and Emigrant Canyon being the major constriction points along the Humboldt River Valley. The upper basin begins in northeastern Nevada and drains about upstream from Palisade. The middle basin has a drainage area of about and lies between Palisade and Emigrant Canyons, a narrow gap located just downstream from Comus. The lower basin is an area encompassing some from below Emigrant Canyon and extending through the Humboldt Sink in northwestern Nevada.

A hydrologic definition instead divides the Humboldt River drainage into two basins—one above and one below Palisade—based on flows that increase above and decrease below this part of the river. The river in the upper basin is long, and in the lower basin it is long. The major tributaries of the upper Humboldt River basin are (heading downstream) Bishop Creek, Marys River, Lamoille Creek, North Fork Humboldt River, South Fork Humboldt River, Susie Creek, Maggie Creek, and Marys Creek; of the lower basin they are Pine Creek, Reese River, and the Little Humboldt River.

The source of the main stem of the river is a spring called Humboldt Wells at the northern tip of the East Humboldt Range, just outside the city of Wells. The river flows west-southwest through Elko County, past the communities of Elko and Carlin. Approximately upstream from Elko, the river receives the North Fork of the Humboldt River and receives the South Fork approximately downstream of Elko.

In northern Eureka County, it passes through Palisade Canyon between the southern end of the Tuscarora Mountains and the north end of the Shoshone Range. At Battle Mountain, the river turns northwest for approximately , then west at Red House and past Golconda and a spur of the Sonoma Range. It merges with the Reese River near Battle Mountain and receives the Little Humboldt River approximately upstream from Winnemucca.

Past the junction with the Little Humboldt, the river turns southwest, flowing past Winnemucca and through Pershing County, along the western side of the Humboldt Range and the West Humboldt Range. In central Pershing County, the Rye Patch Dam impounds the river, forming the Rye Patch Reservoir, which stores water to irrigate farms near Lovelock, downstream. The Humboldt empties into an intermittent lake in the Humboldt Sink on the border between Pershing and Churchill counties, approximately southwest of Lovelock.

The river gains most of its water from snowmelt in the mountains in the eastern part of the watershed, most importantly the Ruby Mountains, Jarbidge Mountains, and Independence Mountains. River flow generally decreases downstream to the west, partly due to water removal from the river for irrigation, especially near Lovelock. Stream-gauge measurements undertaken by the United States Geological Survey suggest that Palisade Canyon, between Carlin and Beowawe, is the point where the river&#x27;s flow ceases to increase and begins to decrease. Also, since the Humboldt&#x27;s water comes almost exclusively from snowmelt, its flow is highly variable from season to season (peak flow occurs during the spring melt) and from year to year (depending on the amount of snow every winter)

==Ecology==

The Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;) is an inland subspecies of cutthroat trout endemic to northern Nevada, eastern California, and southern Oregon. In 1970, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) listed the Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT) as “endangered”. In 1975 it reclassified LCT as “threatened” to facilitate management and to allow regulated fishing. Genetic and meristic studies of LCT indicate that the Humboldt River Basin LCT is a unique subspecies of cutthroat trout.

North American beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) seem to have been making a comeback in Elko County, possibly due to less fur trapping combined with reduced consumption of riparian willow and other vegetation by cattle. Maggie and Susie Creeks, which enter the Humboldt River near Carlin, have benefited from 20 years of work by ranchers, agencies, mines, and non-profit groups via improvements in grazing techniques and specific projects. A remote sensing project found 107 beaver dams along of Maggie Creek in 2006, which rose to 271 dams in 2010. Beaver dams are accelerating the recovery of riparian vegetation and widening the riparian zone as they slow the water and collect sediment that used to be lost downstream. In five years, beaver ponds have increased the amount of impounded water on Maggie Creek from of the stream to . The impounded water is seeping into the ground and raising the water table. Newmont&#x27;s shallow groundwater monitoring wells along Maggie Creek have shown about a rise over the past 17 years along Maggie Creek. Stream flows are more perennial, making more water available for wildlife and livestock and protecting populations of native trout. Maggie Creek has a Beaver Creek tributary which flows from Beaver Peak in the Tuscarora Mountains.

== Environmental aspects ==

The Humboldt River and its surrounding areas have raised some concern about the increasing levels of toxic elements such as arsenic and mercury. These elements show in fish and other wildlife that consume the water. The quantity being absorbed by fish specifically is not of concerning levels, though. Brumbaugh and May took samples of fish from the south fork of the Humboldt River. They determined that mercury levels within the fish were between 0.061 and 0.082 micrograms per gram of flesh. This is well below the EPA&#x27;s guideline of 0.30 micrograms per gram. However, though low levels are found in animals, many people are concerned that drinking water and surrounding land is still contaminated. They believe the contamination came from prior mining excursions. Mercury was commonly mined in the area and so was gold. Whether it was leaching from the gold mining process or leftover mercury ore, these toxic elements entered the environment and waterway. Since then, these levels have gone down considerably. The U.S. Geological Survey and other committees conducted a couple of surveys to determine the safety of the drinking water. In 1962 the Water Resources Bulletin, out of Carson City, conducted one of the first main tests. This preliminary test was to determine every mineral, element, and ion present. The next big test was done in 1985 by the U.S. Geological Survey. They took samples from a much more local area and determined concentrations were high, but not abnormally high. Another more recent test, which was done in 2002, was specifically on mercury being leached from abandoned mines. However, this test determined that mercury levels dropped off very quickly the further away the tests were done. Finally, the most recent study, done in 2019, was an extremely comprehensive test which included samples from numerous places throughout the river&#x27;s path. This test was based out of the University of Nevada Reno and determined what elements and minerals were present. It also determined that toxic element concentrations were fairly consistent. This means that while these elements are present, they do not pose a severe threat.

<text>The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, formerly known as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and also known as Fred Hutch or The Hutch, is a cancer research institute established in 1975 in Seattle, Washington.

==History==
The center grew out of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation, founded in 1956 by William B. Hutchinson (1909–1997). The Foundation was dedicated to the study of heart surgery, cancer, and diseases of the endocrine system. Hutchinson&#x27;s younger brother Fred (1919–1964) was a major league pitcher and manager who died of lung cancer at age 45. The next year, William Hutchinson established the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a division of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation.

In 1972, with the help of Senator Warren G. Magnuson, PNRF received federal funding under the National Cancer Act of 1971 to create in Seattle one of the 15 new NCI-designated Cancer Centers aimed at conducting basic research called for under 1971 Act; the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center became independent 1972 and its building opened three years later 
The center was named an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1976.

In 1998, the center formed the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), a separate nonprofit corporation, with University of Washington School of Medicine (UW Medicine), and Seattle Children&#x27;s. This solidified the center&#x27;s reach into clinical care and was essential for it retaining its NCI comprehensive center designation; the designation was extended to the center&#x27;s consortium including the SCCA in 2003. SCCA&#x27;s outpatient clinic first opened in January 2001.

In 2001, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; published a series of articles alleging that investigators at the center (including the center&#x27;s co-founder E. Donnall Thomas) were conducting unethical clinical studies on cancer patients. The paper alleged that in two cancer studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s, patients were not informed about all the risks of the study, nor about the study doctors&#x27; financial interest in study outcome. The paper also alleged that this financial interest may have contributed to the doctors&#x27; failure to halt the studies despite evidence that patients were dying sooner and more frequently than expected. In response, the center formed a panel of independent experts to review its existing research practices, leading to adoption of new conflict-of-interest rules.

In 2010 Lawrence Corey was appointed as the fourth President, following the retirement of Lee Hartwell. He was followed by
Gary Gilliland in 2015 as president, who led the institute until 2020. Under his leadership the center announced that it would expand into the former Lake Union steam plant, which previously housed ZymoGenetics. The move was completed in October 2020. In February 2020, Thomas J. Lynch Jr. took over as director.

The year 2014 saw the organization adopt its longtime local nickname, &quot;Fred Hutch&quot;, as its official name as part of a rebranding.

On April 1, 2022, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) merged to form Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, a unified adult cancer research and care center that is clinically integrated with University of Washington (UW) Medicine and UW Medicine&#x27;s cancer program.

==Notable faculty==

The center has employed three recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine:
*Linda B. Buck, who received the award in 2004 for solving many details of the olfactory system; and
*Leland H. Hartwell, who received the honor in 2001 for his discoveries regarding the mechanisms that control cell division. After retiring from leading the center in 2010, Hartwell left to join Arizona State University. and
*E. Donnall Thomas, who received the award in 1990 for his pioneering work in bone-marrow transplantation and who died in 2012;

==Commercialization==
The center is active in technology transfer. In 2013, it was one of the top ten biomedical research institutions in the field (excluding universities); it made 18 new deals with companies to develop inventions made at the center, and earned $10,684,882 in income from past deals it had signed. Most notably, Juno Therapeutics, a company developing CAR-T immunotherapy for cancer and that raised $314 million in venture capital investments and had a $265 million initial public offering in 2014, was started based on inventions made at the center. As of 2015, about twenty companies had been started based on center inventions since 1975, including Immunex and Icos.

==Campus==

The institute&#x27;s main campus consists of 13 buildings that are on in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle.

In 1987, the center began exploring possible new homes to replace its 9-building campus on First Hill that it was set to outgrow. A site in the South Lake Union neighborhood, envisioned by the city as a future high-tech and biotechnology hub, was chosen in September 1988 after a deal to move to Fremont fell through earlier that year. The first phase of the campus, designed by firm Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership, began construction in 1991 and opened on June 1, 1993, in a ceremony that included the burying of a time capsule set to open in 2093.

The campus is accessible via the Mercer Street exit of Interstate 5 as well as several public transportation routes, including the South Lake Union Streetcar.

<text>Aspergillus flavus is a saprotrophic and pathogenic fungus with a cosmopolitan distribution. It is best known for its colonization of cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. Postharvest rot typically develops during harvest, storage, and/or transit. Its specific name &quot;&quot; derives from the Latin meaning yellow, a reference to the frequently observed colour of the spores. &quot;A. flavus&quot; infections can occur while hosts are still in the field (preharvest), but often show no symptoms (dormancy) until postharvest storage or transport.

In addition to causing preharvest and postharvest infections, many strains produce significant quantities of toxic compounds known as mycotoxins, which, when consumed, are toxic to mammals. &quot;A. flavus&quot; is also an opportunistic human and animal pathogen, causing aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals.

== Hosts ==
&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; is found globally as a saprophyte in soils and causes disease on many important agriculture crops. Common hosts of the pathogen are cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. Specifically, &quot;A. flavus&quot; infection causes ear rot in corn and yellow mold in peanuts either before or after harvest. 

Infection can be present in the field, preharvest, postharvest, during storage, and during transit. It is common for the pathogen to originate while host crops are still in the field. However, symptoms and signs of the pathogen are often unseen. &quot;A. flavus&quot; has the potential to infect seedlings by sporulation on injured seeds.

In grains, the pathogen can invade seed embryos and cause infection, which decreases germination and can lead to infected seeds planted in the field. The pathogen can also discolor embryos, damage seedlings, and kill seedlings, which reduces grade and price of the grains. The incidence of &quot;A. flavus&quot; infection increases in the presence of insects and any type of stress on the host in the field as a result of damage. Stresses include stalk rot, drought, severe leaf damage, and/or less than ideal storage conditions. 

Generally, excessive moisture conditions and high temperatures of storage grains and legumes increase the occurrence of &quot;A. flavus&quot; aflatoxin production. In mammals, the pathogen can cause liver cancer through consumption of contaminated feed or aspergillosis through invasive growth.

== Morphology and pathology ==
&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; colonies are commonly powdery masses of yellowish-green spores on the upper surface and reddish-gold on the lower surface. In both grains and legumes, infection is minimized to small areas, and discoloration and dullness of affected areas is often seen. Growth is rapid and colonies appear powdery in texture.

Hyphal growth usually occurs by thread-like branching and produces mycelia. Hyphae are septate and hyaline. Once established, the mycelium secretes degradative enzymes or proteins which can break down complex nutrients (food). Individual hyphae strands are not typically seen by the unaided eye; however, conidia producing thick mycelial mats are often seen. The conidiospores are asexual spores produced by &quot;A. flavus&quot; during reproduction.

The conidiophores of &quot;A. flavus&quot; are rough and colorless. Phialides are both uniseriate (arranged in one row) and biseriate.

Recently, &quot;Petromyces&quot; was identified as the sexual reproductive stage of &quot;A. flavus&quot;, where the ascospores develop within sclerotia. The sexual state of this heterothallic fungus arises when strains of opposite mating type are cultured together. Sexual reproduction occurs between sexually compatible strains belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups.

&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; is complex in its morphology and can be classified into two groups based on the size of sclerotia produced. Group I consists of L strains with sclerotia greater than 400 μm in diameter. Group II consists of S strains with sclerotia less than 400 μm in diameter. Both L and S strains can produce the two most common aflatoxins (B1 and B2). Unique to the S strains is the production of aflatoxin G1 and G2 which typically are not produced by &quot;A. flavus&quot;. The L strain is more aggressive than the S strain, but produces less aflatoxin in culture. The L strain also has a more acidic homoeostatic point and produces less sclerotia than the S strain under more limiting conditions.

== Disease cycle ==
&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; overwinters in the soil and appears as propagules on decaying matter, either as mycelia or sclerotia. Sclerotia germinate to produce additional hyphae and asexual spores called conidia. These conidia are said to be the primary inoculum for &quot;A. flavus&quot;. The propagules in the soil, which are now conidia, are dispersed by wind and insects, such as stink bugs or lygus bugs. The conidia can land on and infect either grains or legumes.

The spores enter the corn through the silks and thus infect the kernel. Conidiophores and conidia are produced in the spring from sclerotial surfaces. There is a secondary inoculum for &quot;A. flavus&quot;, which is conidia on leaf parts and leaves. &quot;A. flavus&quot; grows on leaves after damage by leaf-feeding insects. Insects are said to be a source of inoculum and promote inoculum production.

== Environment ==
&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; is unique in that it is a thermotolerant fungus, so can survive at temperatures that other fungi cannot. &quot;A. flavus&quot; can contribute to the storage rots, especially when the plant material is stored at high moisture levels. &quot;A. flavus&quot; grows and thrives in hot and humid climates.

Temperature: &quot;A. flavus&quot; has a minimum growth temperature of and a maximum growth temperature of . Though the maximum growth temperature is around , the optimum growth temperature is . &quot;A. flavus&quot; had rapid growth at , slow growth at , and almost ceases growth at .

Moisture: &quot;A. flavus&quot; growth occurs at different moisture levels for different crops. For starchy cereals, growth occurs at 13.0–13.2%. For soybeans, growth occurs at 11.5–11.8%. For other crops, growth occurs at 14%. &quot;A. flavus&quot; growth is prevalent in tropical countries. Minimum a (water activity) required for growth is inversely correlated with temperature in other words higher temperatures permit lower a. This is known to range from a 0.78 at to 0.84 at . Gibson et al 1994 provides a model relating expected growth rate to a x temperature parameters.

== Management ==
To ensure grains and legumes remain free of &quot;A. flavus&quot; infection, certain conditions must be incorporated before, during, and after harvest. Moisture levels should be kept below 11.5%. Temperature in storage units should be kept as low as possible since the pathogen is unable to grow below 5 °C. The low temperature facilitates slower respiration and prevents moisture increase. Fumigants are used to decrease the occurrence and persistence of insects and mites, which aids the rapid growth of the pathogen. Sanitary practices including, removing old and unripe seeds, exclusion of damaged and broken seeds, and overall cleanliness assist in minimizing the colonization and spread of the pathogen.

The most common management practice for grains and legumes is the use of aeration systems. Air is pushed through the storage bins at low flow rates, which removes excess moisture and heat. Regulation of air flow allows the moisture content in harvested products to remain at a constant level and decreases the temperature within the bins. Temperature levels can decrease enough so insects and mites are dormant, which reduces rapid growth of the pathogen.

Some environmental control practice have been explored to aid in the reduction of &quot;A. flavus&quot; infection. Resistant crop lines have shown little to no protection against unfavorable environmental conditions. However, good irrigation practices aid in the reduction of stress brought upon by drought, which in turn, reduces the likelihood of pathogen infection. Some research has been done in identifying particular plant proteins, both pathogen-related and drought-resistant proteins, that defend against &quot;A. flavus&quot; entry.

To protect tree nuts and corn plants affected by &quot;A. flavus&quot;, scientists of the Agricultural Research Service found that treating these plants with the yeast &quot;Pichia anomala&quot; reduced the growth of &quot;A. flavus&quot;. The study showed that treating pistachio trees with &quot;P. anomala&quot; inhibited the growth of &quot;A. flavus&quot; up to 97% when compared to untreated trees. The yeast successfully competes with &quot;A. flavus&quot; for space and nutrients, ultimately limiting its growth.

Essential oils of &quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot; inhibit growth.

=== &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; AF36 ===

&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; strain AF36 is noncarcinogenic and aflatoxin-free and is used as an active ingredient in pesticides. AF36 is a fungal antagonist and is applied as a commercial biocontrol to cotton and corn to reduce aflatoxin exposure. AF36 was initially isolated in Arizona and has also occurred in Texas. It is grown on sterile seeds which serve as the carrier and a source of nutrients. Following application and colonization and in the presence of high moisture, AF36 growing seeds outcompete aflatoxin-producing strains of &quot;A. flavus&quot;. Nonaflatoxin spore dispersal is aided by wind and insects.

== Importance ==
&quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; infections will not always reduce crop yields alone; however, postharvest disease can reduce the total crop yield by 10 to 30%, and in developing countries that produce perishable crops, total loss can be greater than 30%. In grains and legumes, postharvest disease results in the production of mycotoxins. The largest economic loss caused by this pathogen is a result of aflatoxin production. In the United States, annual economic loss estimations of peanuts, corn, cottonseed, walnuts, and almonds are less severe when compared to Asia and Africa.

After &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, &quot;A. flavus&quot; is the second-leading cause of aspergillosis. Primary infection is caused by the inhalation of spores; bigger spores have a better chance of settling in the upper respiratory tract. The deposition of certain spore sizes could be a leading factor for why &quot;A. flavus&quot; is a common etiological cause of fungal sinusitis and cutaneous infections and noninvasive fungal pneumonia. Countries with dry weather, such as Saudi Arabia and most of Africa, are more prone to aspergillosis.

Two allergens have been characterized in &quot;A. flavus&quot;: Asp fl 13 and Asp fl 18. In tropical and warm climates, &quot;A. flavus&quot; has been shown to cause keratitis in about 80% of infections. &quot;A. flavus&quot; infection is typically treated with antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin; however, some antifungal resistance has been shown in amphotericin B, itraconazole, and voriconazole.

=== Aflatoxin ===
In 1960 on an English farm, about 100,000 turkeys died. Investigation into the cause of death showed the primary food source, peanut meal, was infected with &quot;A. flavus&quot;. The culture was isolated, grown in pure culture, and a subset of healthy turkeys was infected. The pure culture isolate caused death in the healthy turkeys. Chemical investigation into the cause of death showed the production of four toxic chemicals, named aflatoxins after being discovered in &quot;A. flavus&quot;. Turkey necropsies showed aflatoxins targeted the liver and either completely killed the tissue cells or induced tumor formation. The discovery of aflatoxins led to substantial changes in agricultural practices and regulations on how grains and legumes were grown, harvested, and stored.

The amount of aflatoxins produced by &quot;A. flavus&quot; is affected by environmental factors. If other competitive fungal organisms are present on host plants, aflatoxin production is low. However, if noncompetitive fungal organisms are present on host plants, aflatoxin production can be quite high. The nature of the host is also an important factor in aflatoxin production. High &quot;A. flavus&quot; growth on soybean produces very little aflatoxin. High &quot;A. flavus&quot; growth aided by increased moisture content and warm temperatures on peanut, nutmeg, and peppers produces high concentrations of aflatoxins. &quot;A. flavus&quot; growth on spices produces low concentrations of aflatoxin as long as the spices remain dry.

Species sensitivity is highly variable when exposed to aflatoxins. Rainbow trout are highly sensitive at 20 ppb, causing liver tumor development in half the population. White rats develop liver cancer when exposed to 15 ppb. Young piglets, ducklings, and turkeys exposed to high doses of aflatoxin become sick and die. Pregnant cows, mature pigs, cattle, and sheep exposed to low doses of aflatoxin over long periods develop weakening, intestinal bleeding, debilitation, reduced growth, nausea, no appetite, and predisposition to other infections.

The four major aflatoxins produced are B1, B2, G1, and G2. The production of the major toxins is a result of particular strains of &quot;A. flavus&quot;. Aflatoxin B1 is the most toxic and potent hepatocarcinogenic natural compound characterized. &quot;A. flavus&quot; also produces other toxic compounds including sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, kojic acid, β-nitropropionic acid, aspertoxin, aflatrem, gliotoxin, and aspergillic acid.

In humans, &quot;A. flavus&quot; aflatoxin production can lead to acute hepatitis, immunosuppression, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neutropenia. The absence of any regulation of screening for the fungus in countries that also have a high prevalence of viral hepatitis highly increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The deaths of ten conservationists present at the opening of a 15th century tomb in Kraków, Poland in the 1970s has been attributed to aflatoxins originating from &quot;A. flavus&quot; present in the tomb.

== Possible link to deaths after tomb openings ==

After the premature death of several Polish scientists following the 1973 opening of the tomb of the 15th century Polish King (and Lithuanian Grand Duke) Casimir IV Jagiellon, microbiologist Bolesław Smyk identified the presence of the &quot;A. flavus&quot; in samples taken from the tomb, and media reports have suggested that the likely cause of the deaths were the aflatoxins produced by this fungus.

It has since been suggested that it may also have contributed to some of the deaths following the 1922 discovery and subsequent opening of the tomb of Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun, particularly the deaths of Lord Carnarvon, George Jay Gould, and Arthur Mace, though the link has been disputed (at least in Carnarvon&#x27;s case).

<text>The Indian Administrative Service (IAS) is the administrative arm of the All India Services of Government of India. The IAS is one of the three All India Services along with the Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service. Members of these three services serve the Government of India as well as the individual states. IAS officers are also deployed to various government constitutional bodies, staff and line agencies, auxiliary bodies, public sector undertakings, regulatory bodies, statutory bodies and autonomous bodies.

As with other countries following the parliamentary system of government, the IAS is a part of the permanent bureaucracy of the nation; and is an inseparable part of the executive of the Government of India. As such, the bureaucracy remains politically neutral and guarantees administrative continuity to the ruling party or coalition.

Upon confirmation of service, an IAS officer serves a probationary period as a sub-divisional magistrate. Completion of this probation is followed by an executive administrative role in a district as a district magistrate and collector which lasts several years. After this tenure, an officer may be promoted to head a whole state administrative division as a divisional commissioner.

On attaining the higher scales of the pay matrix, IAS officers may lead government departments or ministries. In these roles, IAS officers represent the country at international level in bilateral and multilateral negotiations. If serving on a deputation, they may be employed in International organization such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or the United Nations, or its agencies. IAS officers are also involved in conducting elections in India as mandated by the Election Commission of India.

==History==
During the East India Company period, the civil services were classified into threecovenanted, uncovenanted and special civil services. The covenanted civil service, or the Honourable East India Company&#x27;s Civil Service (HEICCS), as it was called, largely comprised civil servants occupying the senior posts in the government. The uncovenanted civil service was introduced solely to facilitate the entry of Indians onto the lower rung of the administration. The special service comprised specialised departments, such as the Indian Forest Service, the Imperial Police and the Indian Political Department, whose ranks were drawn from either the covenanted civil service or the Indian Army. The Imperial Police included many Indian Army officers among its members, although after 1893 an annual exam was used to select its officers. In 1858 the HEICCS was replaced by the Indian Civil Service (ICS), which became the highest civil service in India between 1858 and 1947. The last appointments to the ICS were made in 1942.

With the passing of the Government of India Act 1919 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Indian civil services—under the general oversight of the Secretary of State for India—were split into two arms, the All India Services and the Central Services. The Indian Civil Service was one of the ten All India Services.

In 1946 at the Premier&#x27;s Conference, the Central Cabinet decided to form the Indian Administrative Service, based on the Indian Civil Service; and the Indian Police Service, based on the Imperial Police.

When India was partitioned following the departure of the British in 1947, the Indian Civil Service was divided between the new dominions of India and Pakistan. The Indian remnant of the ICS was named the Indian Administrative Service, while the Pakistan remnant was named the District Management Group (later renamed to Pakistan Administrative Service in 2012). The modern Indian Administrative Service was created under Article 312(2) in part XIV of the Constitution of India, and the All India Services Act, 1951.

==Indian Frontier Administrative Service==
A special cadre was created in 1954 to administer NEFA (present day Arunachal Pradesh) and for later Some North Eastern Region. It was first mooted by then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru. The services were placed under Ministry of External Affairs.

In 1968, IFAS was merged with IAS and has hence lost its relevance.

==Recruitment==

There are three modes of recruitment into the Indian Administrative Service. IAS officers may enter the IAS by passing the Civil Services Examination, which is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Officers recruited this way are called direct recruits or regular recruits (RR). Some IAS officers are also recruited from the state civil services, and, in rare cases, selected from non-state civil service. The ratio between direct recruits and promotees is fixed at 2:1. All IAS officers, regardless of the mode of entry, are appointed by the President of India.
Only about 180 candidates out of over 1million applicants, who apply through CSE, are successful, a success rate of less than 0.02percent.

Unlike candidates appointed to other civil services, a successful IAS candidate is rendered ineligible to retake CSE. From 1951 to 1978, an IAS/IFS candidate was required to submit two additional papers along with three optional papers (instead of just the three optional papers like for other civil services) to be eligible for the Indian Administrative Service or the Indian Foreign Service. The two additional papers were postgraduate level submissions, compared to the graduate level of the optional papers, and it was this distinction that resulted in a higher status for the IAS and IFS. The two postgraduate level submissions were later removed, but this has not changed the perceived higher status of the IAS and IFS. After the selection process, the successful candidates undergo training at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand.

===State cadres===
====Cadre allocation policy====
The central government announced a new cadre allocation policy for the All India Services in August 2017, claiming it as being a policy to ensure national integration of the bureaucracy and to ensure an All India character of the services. The existing twenty sixcadres were to be divided into fivezones by the Department of Personnel and Training. Under the new policy, a candidate first selects their zones of preference, in descending order, then indicates a cadre preference from each preferred zone. The candidate indicates their second cadre preference for every preferred zone subsequently. The preference for the zones and cadres remains in the same order and no change is permitted.

Officers remain in their allocated cadre or are deputed to the Government of India.

====Previous cadre allocation policies====
Until 2008, there was no formal system that permitted the selection of a state cadre preferred by the candidate. If the candidate was not placed in a vacancy in their home state, they would be allocated to other states, which were selected from a roster in alphabetic order, starting from &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;h&#x27;, &#x27;m&#x27; or &#x27;t&#x27;, depending on the year. For example, if in a particular year the roster begins from &#x27;a&#x27;, then the first candidate on the roster will go to the Andhra Pradesh state cadre, the next one to Bihar, and then to Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and so on in alphabetical order. The next year the roster starts from &#x27;h&#x27;, for either Haryana or Himachal Pradesh (the two states alternate roster years). This system, practised since the mid-1980s, ensured that officers from different states were placed all over India.

The system of permanent state cadres resulted in wide disparities of professional exposure for officers when comparing those from developed versus less developed states. Changes in state cadres were only permitted on grounds of marriage to an All India Services officer of another state cadre or under other exceptional circumstances. The officers were allowed to go to their home state cadre on deputation for a limited period after which they would be required to return to their allocated cadre.

From 2008, IAS officers were assigned to state cadres at the beginning of their service. There was one cadre for each Indian state, except for twojoint cadres: Assam–Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh–Goa–Mizoram–Union Territories (AGMUT). The &quot;insider-outsider ratio&quot; (ratio of officers who were posted to their home states to those from other states) was maintained at 1:2, with one-third of the direct recruits being &#x27;insiders&#x27; from the same state. The rest were posted as outsiders according to the state allocation roster in states other than their home states, as indicated by their preference.

==Responsibilities of an IAS officer==

The typical functions performed by an IAS officer are:
*To collect land revenue and function as court officials in matters of land revenue (for the revenue courts), to maintain law and order, to implement union and state government policies at the grass-roots level when posted to field positions i.e. as Sub-divisional magistrate, Additional District Magistrate, District magistrate and Divisional commissioner, and to act as an agent of the government in the field, i.e. to act as an intermediary between the public and the government. 
*To implement government policies, to execute government decisions, to oversee the day to day administration and serve as the head of the department, to coordinate with other departments/agencies, to represent the department when posted as Director/Commissioner of a Directorate/Commissionerate/Department.
*To handle the administration and daily proceedings of the government, including the formulation and implementation of policy in consultation with the minister-in-charge of a specific ministry or department.
*To contribute to policy formulation, and to make a final decision in certain matters, with the agreement of the minister concerned or the council of ministers (depending upon the weight of the matter), when posted at the higher level in the Government of India as a joint secretary, additional secretary, special secretary or secretary equivalent, secretary and Cabinet Secretary, and in state governments as secretary, principal secretary, additional chief secretary or special chief secretary and chief secretary.

==Career progression==
At the beginning of their career, IAS officers receive district training with their home cadres followed by their first posting. Their initial role is as an assistant collector cum sub-divisional magistrate and they are placed in charge of a district sub-division. As assistant collector cum sub divisional magistrate, they are entrusted with maintaining law and order, as well as general administration and development work, of the sub-district.

Completion of probation is followed by an executive role in a district as a district collector cum district magistrate, which lasts several years. After this tenure as a district magistrate or district collector or deputy commissioner, IAS officers can be posted to various positions in the state government. These positions include secretary or principal secretary in different departments, director of a department, divisional commissioner, or chairman of a government corporation. The specific positions depend on the officer&#x27;s seniority, experience, and performance. The highest positions that an IAS officer can attain include chief secretary of a state or cabinet secretary of the country.

In 2015 it was announced that a new designation of assistant secretary at the Central Secretariat had been created to enable new IAS officers to be posted to Delhi for a three-month assignment as part of their training regime. IAS officers were previously only permitted to go on a deputation once assigned to the Central Secretariat after nine years of service in their home cadre. It was observed that the experience of central functions was severely lacking among these deputations, resulting in this change in their training. As part of the new system, IAS assistant secretaries are supposed to work on projects—a new policy in their respective areas—and present it to their respective ministries; of all projects, 36 are selected to be presented before all secretaries of the Government of India; consequently, 16 are selected to be before the Cabinet Secretary and a final eight are selected for presentation before the Prime Minister.

As an IAS officer progresses in their career, they become eligible for important positions in the central government. These positions include joint secretary, additional secretary, and secretary in different ministries and departments. In these roles, IAS officers are involved in making policies, implementing them, and making important decisions at the national level. They can also be appointed as advisors to the central government or serve in autonomous bodies, commissions, and international organizations. These opportunities allow IAS officers to contribute to the development and governance of the country on a larger scale.

On attaining the apex scale, IAS officers may lead government departments or ministries. In these roles, IAS officers represent the country at the international level in bilateral and multilateral negotiations. If serving on a deputation, they may be employed in International organization such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the United Nations or its agencies. IAS officers are also involved in the conduct of elections in India as mandated by the Election Commission of India.
Upon retirement, high ranking IAS officers have occupied constitutional posts such as the Chief Election Commissioner of India, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, and the chairperson of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). They have also become members of administrative tribunals, such as the National Green Tribunal and the Central Administrative Tribunal, as well as chiefs of regulators including the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the Reserve Bank of India. If a serving IAS officer is appointed to a constitutional post such as Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Chief Election Commissioner of India or chairperson of UPSC or as head of a statutory authority, such as the National Commission for Women or the Central Information Commission, he or she is deemed to have retired from service.

IAS officers can also be deputed to private organisations for a fixed tenure under Rule 6(2)(ii) of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954.

===Assessment of suitability for promotion and posting===
The performance of IAS officers is assessed through a performance appraisal report (PAR). These are governed through the All India Services (Performance Appraisal Report) Rules 2007. The reports are reviewed to judge the suitability of an officer before a promotion or a posting in the union or state governments. The report is compiled annually and is initiated by the officers themselves, designated as the reporting officer, who list their achievements, completion of assigned activities and targets for the year. The report is then modified and commented on by the reviewing officer, usually the superior of the reporting officer. All the Reports are forwarded by the reviewing officer to the accepting authority, who conducts a final review of the report.

==Public perception==
In popular perception, the allure of pursuing a career in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) lies in the associated privileges and benefits, which drive hundreds of thousands of candidates to compete for a limited number of positions each year. The position of an IAS officer is commonly regarded as a gateway to power, privilege, and elevated social status. Criticisms of the country&#x27;s bureaucracy have persisted over time, with detractors highlighting its cumbersome nature, slow decision-making processes, inefficiency, and instances of corruption. These deficiencies have become so widely acknowledged that the Indian bureaucracy often becomes the subject of relentless satirical portrayals in popular culture.

==Major concerns and reforms==
===Shortage of officers===
It was reported in 2017 that there is a shortage of about 1,700IAS officers in the country. Despite this, the government has stated that annual recruitment of IAS officers will not increase, to avoid impacting the career progression of existing officers and the overall structure of the service.

===Lack of accountability===
Critics argue that the IAS lacks adequate mechanisms for holding bureaucrats accountable for their actions. This can lead to a culture of impunity and inefficiency, as civil servants may not face consequences for poor performance or misconduct. Critics argue that bureaucracy can lead to a lack of accountability as unelected bureaucrats hold significant decision-making power. They argue that bureaucrats, who are not directly accountable to the public through elections, can wield significant influence over policies and implementation without facing direct consequences for their actions.

===Centralization of power===
The IAS is a highly centralized bureaucracy, with decision-making power concentrated at the higher levels of the hierarchy. This centralized structure can impede decentralization efforts and limit the involvement of lower-level administrators and local stakeholders in decision-making processes.

===Resistance to change===
The bureaucratic culture within the IAS can sometimes lead to resistance to change and a reluctance to adopt new ideas or reforms. This can hinder innovation and prevent the adoption of best practices, making it challenging to address emerging challenges effectively.

===Lateral entry===
Media personalities, some retired IAS officers and a few academics have argued in favour of lateral entry into the IAS to inject fresh blood into the service. They argue that it would help refresh the bureaucracy, offer competitiveness and bring in alternate perspectives. A counter-argument has been put forward that a lateral entry process could be manipulated due to corruption and cronyism. It is further argued that lateral entry would not lead to improvements in managerial performance or accountability, and while it may create synergy between the government and big businesses, it could also compromise the integrity of government. It has also been argued that it could weaken the bureaucracy instead. The union government has frequently ruled out lateral entry into the IAS.

===Political influence===

Several think tanks and media outlets have argued that the IAS is hamstrung by political influence within the service. It has been reported that many local political leaders have been seen to have interfered with IAS officers. Politicians have also exerted pressure on IAS officers by repeatedly transferring them, suspending them, beating them, and, in some extreme cases, killing them.

While hearing &quot;T. S. R. Subramanian v. Union of India&quot;, the Supreme Court of India ruled that IAS officersand other civil servantswere not required to act on oral instructions given by politicians as they &#x27;undermined credibility&#x27;.

===Corruption===

Several academic papers have shown IAS to be a significant contributor to crony capitalism in India. In 2015, it was reported by the Government of India that a hundred IAS officers had come under scrutiny by the Central Bureau of Investigation for alleged corruption. In 2017 Government records showed that 379 IAS officers had deliberately failed to submit details of their immovable assets (IPR). Since 2007, a number of chief secretaries and a principal secretary have been arrested in cases of graft or money laundering. IAS officers have been found amassing disproportionate assets and wealth varying from , to . In 2016 it was reported that the Government would provide the means to prosecute corrupt IAS officers, with the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions agreeing to receive requests from private citizens seeking punitive measures against IAS officers even without supporting documentation.

In 2017, a Central Bureau of Investigation special court in Delhi sentenced a former Union Coal Secretary and two other IAS officers to two years in prison for their involvement in the coal allocation scam.

In 2017 it was reported by the Department of Personnel and Training, part of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, that, since 2014, one IAS officer was prematurely retired from service, ten IAS officers had been deemed to have resigned, five had their pensions cut, and a further eight IAS officers suffered a cut in remuneration.

In 2018 the Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Jitendra Singh, informed the Lok Sabha that disciplinary proceedings were underway against 36 IAS officers. In 2020, Central Bureau of Investigation arrested two district magistrates in connection with an illegal arms license distribution scandal in the then Jammu &amp; Kashmir state.

During year 2020–21, 581 corruption charges were filed against IAS officers. Further, a total of 753 complaints were received against the IAS officers in 2019-20 and 643 in 2018–19.

Former IAS officer and RBI Governor, D. Subbarao said &quot;25% IAS officers are corrupt, incompetent or inefficient; middle 50% started well but have become complacent and only 25% are truly delivering&quot;, while discussing his book with the media platforms.

===Abandonment of service===
In June 2015, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that twelve IAS officers had gone missing, and had not reported to either the union or the state government for their allocated cadre. It was believed that they were working in foreign countries for companies such as Microsoft for more lucrative pay. &quot;The Asian Age&quot; later reported that the services of three of the twelve officers were likely to be terminated due to &quot;prolonged absence from service&quot;.

===Misuse of Reservation===
Several IAS officers have been accused of misuse of reservation by means of submitting fraudulent documents and certificates, especially for disability or caste. This has led to their dismissal or suspension, even jail time for fraud. This has denied fair opportunities to capable candidates from general category.

In September 2024, Puja Khedkar, an IAS officer of Maharashtra cadre from the 2023 batch, was dismissed and arrested, after she was found to have submitted fraudulent caste and disability documents and certificates. The Union Public Service Commission stated that Khedkar was guilty of acting in contravention of the provisions of the Civil Services Examination-2022 Rules, and that Khedkar allegedly demanded special privileges such as a separate office, house, car, and staff, which she was not entitled to as a probationary officer.

<doc id="698076" wikidata="Q7894109" url="?curid=698076" title="Universal call to holiness">
<text>The universal call to holiness is a teaching of the Roman Catholic Church that all people are called to be holy, and is based on Matthew 5:48: &quot;Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect&quot; (). In the first book of the Bible, the call to holiness is expressed in the Lord&#x27;s words to Abraham: &quot;Walk before me, and be blameless&quot; ().

==Description==
Chapter V of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; discusses the Universal Call to Holiness: ...all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity; ...They must follow in His footsteps and conform themselves to His image seeking the will of the Father in all things. They must devote themselves with all their being to the glory of God and the service of their neighbor.

Pope Benedict XVI spoke on the Universal Call to Holiness during his General Audience of Wednesday, 13 April 2011, saying: 
...The saints expressed in various ways the powerful and transforming presence of the Risen One. They let Jesus so totally overwhelm their life that they could say with St Paul &quot;it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me&quot; (Gal 2:20). Following their example, seeking their intercession, entering into communion with them, &quot;brings us closer to Christ, so our companionship with the saints joins us to Christ, from whom as from their fountain and head issue every grace and the life of the People of God itself&quot; (cf. Second Vatican Council, Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium, n. 50).

At the end of this series of Catecheses, therefore, I would like to offer some thoughts on what holiness is. What does it mean to be holy? Who is called to be holy? We are often led to think that holiness is a goal reserved for a few elect. St Paul, instead, speaks of God&#x27;s great plan and says: &quot;even as he (God) chose us in him [Christ] before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him&quot; (Eph 1:4). And he was speaking about all of us. At the centre of the divine plan is Christ in whom God shows his Face, in accord with the favour of his will. The Mystery hidden in the centuries is revealed in its fullness in the Word made flesh. And Paul then says: &quot;in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell&quot; (Col 1:19)...

The Second Vatican Council, in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, speaks with clarity of the universal call to holiness, saying that no one is excluded: &quot;The forms and tasks of life are many but holiness is one—that sanctity which is cultivated by all who act under God&#x27;s Spirit and… follow Christ, poor, humble and cross-bearing, that they may deserve to be partakers of his glory&quot; (Lumen Gentium, n. 41)

The universal call to holiness is rooted in baptism, and the Paschal Mystery, which configures a person to Jesus Christ who is truly God and truly man, thus uniting a person with the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, bringing him in communion with intra-trinitarian life.

Ben Sira taught about lay people that &quot;without these cannot a city be inhabited,&quot; and &quot;they will maintain the state of the world, and all their desire is in the work of their craft.&quot;

Since 1928, St. Josemaría Escrivá, the founder of Opus Dei, also preached the universal call to holiness especially for lay people living an everyday life and doing ordinary work: &quot;There is something holy, something divine, hidden in the most ordinary situations, and it is up to each of you to discover it.&quot;

John Paul II states in his apostolic Letter &quot;Novo Millennio Ineunte&quot;, his apostolic letter for the new millennium, a &quot;program for all times&quot;, that holiness is not only a state but a task, whereby Christians should strive for a full Christian life, imitating Christ, God the Son, who gave his life for God the Father and for his neighbor. This entails a &quot;training in the art of prayer&quot;. According to the Pope, all pastoral initiatives have to be set in relation to holiness, as this has to be the topmost priority of the Church. The universal call to holiness is explained as more fundamental than the vocational discernment to particular ways of life such as priesthood, marriage, or virginity.

At the core of the spirituality of a Catholic is this call to perfection.

<text>The white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) is a small songbird of the family Vireonidae. 

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in the eastern United States from New England west to northern Missouri and south to Texas and Florida, and also in eastern Mexico, northern Central America, Cuba and the Bahamas. Populations on the US Gulf Coast and further south are resident, but most North American birds migrate south in winter. This vireo frequents bushes and shrubs in abandoned cultivation or overgrown pastures. 
==Breeding==
They nest near the ground in tangled thickets, they are made of weeds, leaves, grass, bark or any trash. The grass-lined nest is a neat cup shape, attached to a fork in a tree branch by spider webs. It lays 3–5 dark-spotted white eggs. Both the male and female incubate the eggs for 12–16 days. The young leave the nest 9–11 days after hatching.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 4.3–5.1 in (11–13 cm)
* Weight: 0.3–0.5 oz (10–14 g)
* Wingspan: 6.7 in (17 cm)

Its head and back are a greyish olive, and the underparts are white with yellow flanks. The wings and tail are dark, and there are two white wing bars on each wing. The eyes have white irises, and are surrounded by yellow spectacles. Sexes are similar.
==Call==
The white-eyed vireo&#x27;s song is a variable and rapid six to seven note phrase, starting and ending with a sharp &quot;chick&quot;.
==Diet==
During the breeding season, the diet of this species consists almost exclusively of insects, primarily caterpillars. In the autumn and winter it supplements its diet of insects with berries.

==Taxonomy==
The white-eyed vireo was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his &quot;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Tanagra grisea&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. Buffon specified that his specimen had come from Louisiana, but in 1945 the type locality was restricted to New Orleans. The white-eyed vireo is now placed in the genus &quot;Vireo&quot; was introduced in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The word &quot;vireo&quot; was used by Latin authors for a small green migratory bird, probably a Eurasian golden oriole but a European greenfinch has also been suggested. The specific epithet &quot;griseus&quot; is Medieval Latin for grey.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;V. g. griseus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – central and east US (includes &quot;noveboracensis&quot;)
* &quot;V. g. maynardi&quot; Brewster, 1887 – south Florida (southeast US)
* &quot;V. g. bermudianus&quot; Bangs &amp; Bradlee, 1901 – Bermuda
* &quot;V. g. micrus&quot; Nelson, 1899 – south Texas (south US) and northeast Mexico
* &quot;V. g. perquisitor&quot; Nelson, 1900 – east Mexico
* &quot;V. g. marshalli&quot; Phillips, AR, 1991 – east central Mexico

The northern subspecies, &quot;V. g. noveboracensis&quot;, occupies most of the range of this species and is fully migratory. This sub-species is larger and has more brightly colored plumage than all other subspecies.

The resident southeastern coastal plain race, &quot;V. g. griseus&quot; is a slightly smaller and duller colored subspecies. It does not typically migrate out of its breeding range in the winter.

The resident Florida Keys race, &quot;V. g. maynardi&quot;, is greyer above and whiter below, and the south Texan &quot;V. g. micrus&quot; is like a smaller &quot;maynardi&quot;.

&quot;V. g. bermudianus&quot; is endemic to Bermuda, where it is known as the &quot;Chick of the Village&quot;. This has shorter wings and a duller plumage. Along with other endemic and native Bermudian birds, it was threatened with extinction following the loss of 8 million Bermuda cedar trees in the 1940s, and is now quite rare. This species is listed under the Bermuda Protected Species Act 2003.

<text>The Humboldt Sink is an intermittent dry lake bed, approximately 11 mi (18 km) long, and 4 mi (6 km) across, in northwestern Nevada in the United States. The body of water in the sink is known as Humboldt Lake. The sink and its surrounding area was a notorious and dreaded portion (called the Forty Mile Desert) of overland travel to California during the westward migrations of the mid-1800s, which were largely undertaken along the California Trail.

Humboldt Sink is located between the West Humboldt Range (to the southeast) and the Trinity Range (to the northwest), on the border between Pershing and Churchill counties, approximately northeast of Reno. It is fed from the northeast by the Humboldt River, the second longest river in the Great Basin of North America (after the Bear River). Interstate 80 (I-80) passes along the northwest side of the sink.

The sink has no natural outlet. A channel connecting it with the Carson Sink was cut by the Nevada Department of Transportation in 1984 to prevent I-80 and the town of Lovelock from flooding after heavy snowfall in the preceding three years. As of 2004, this channel has been dry since 1986. The sink, along with the Carson Sink, is remnants of the larger prehistoric Lake Lahontan that existed at the end of the last ice age, approximately 13,000 years ago.

The sink is protected as part of the Humboldt Wildlife Management Area. Wetlands in and near the sink, such as the Humboldt Salt Marsh provide important nesting, foraging, and resting habitat to large numbers of migratory birds.

The sink has a long history of human habitation. In addition to Lovelock Cave, an outcrop in the West Humboldt Range in which 2000-year-old duck decoys have been found, there is also evidence of huts constructed in the bed of Lake Humboldt. Evidence from these important archaeological sites suggests that Native Americans hunted and fished in the Humboldt Sink during wetter climatic periods.

These landforms are named for the Humboldt River, which is in turn named after German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.

<text>Concerto Italiano is an Italian early music ensemble well known for their interpretations of Monteverdi and Vivaldi, among others.

The historically informed performance ensemble was formed by the harpsichordist Rinaldo Alessandrini, and made its Rome debut with Francesco Cavalli&#x27;s &quot;La Calisto&quot; in 1984. Since then, Concerto Italiano has recorded Monteverdi madrigals, which have won numerous awards, including the Gramophone Award three times. Other major international awards garnered by this ensemble include &quot;Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik&quot;, &quot;Prix de la Nouivelle Académie du disque&quot;, &quot;Premio internationale del disco Antonio Vivaldi&quot; (Cini Foundation), and the &quot;Prix de l&#x27;Académie Charles Cros&quot;. 

Concerto Italiano is under exclusive contract with OPUS 111, which is now under the umbrella of the large French label, Naïve. Most recently, with conjunction with the National University Library in Turin, Concerto Italiano has been recording all the operas and concertos of Vivaldi, many of which have not been performed for over 300 years. Highlights include Concerto Italiano&#x27;s recordings of the opera &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot;, &quot;La Senna Festeggiante&quot;, &quot;Le Quattro Stagioni&quot; (hailed as one of the best versions of the work by Gramophone), &quot;Vespri Solenni per la Festa dell&#x27;Assunzione di Maria Vergine&quot; (a reconstruction of a possible Vespers for the Ascension of the Virgin Mary and 2004 Gramophone winner for Baroque Vocal), and in 2004, an entire CD devoted to Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Concerti per Archi&quot;.

<doc id="698102" wikidata="Q4009271" url="?curid=698102" title="Neoclassic (automobile)">
<text>A neoclassic, in automobile circles, is a relatively modern car that is made somewhat in the image of the classic cars of the 1920s and 1930s (as defined by, for example, the Classic Car Club of America) without being necessarily intended as a full replica. They are vehicles that hold the design prior to Ponton design, so they still keep the wheel arches separate from the bodywork.

The term originated with the Excalibur automobile in the 1960s in the United States, and has been applied to cars from a number of makes since then, including Panther, Zimmer, Clénet, Mitsuoka, Desande, Spartan and others. Currently there are more than 30 brands that produce Neoclassic cars.

<text>Húsafell () is a sprawling farm and church estate and the former site of a rectory. It is the innermost farm in Borgarfjörður in the west county of Iceland, not far from Reykholt and Reykholtsdalur. Húsafell farm now serves as a hub of service for various types of tourists visiting and residing in its surrounding area. The Húsafell surrounding area thus includes a wide array of second homes, tent sites, holiday housing and short term lodgings. Among its amenities are a swimming pool and a golf course. The wider Borgarfjörður region is also renowned for its multitude of lakes where there is trout to be had and salmon to be lured in the many rivers where it is possible to go fishing.

The actual estate of Húsafell farm stretches all the way to the roots of Eiríksjökull and Langjökull, covering all in all an area of appr. 100 square kilometers. The farm itself is situated in the midst of Hallmundarhraun, and the Húsafell birch wood of Húsafellsskógur. Due to its sunny and warm summer climate and natural calmness of its surrounding stretch of lava, Húsafell and its surrounding area played host to Iceland&#x27;s most popular outdoor music festivals during the 1960s and the 1970s.

In the near vicinity of Húsafell are the natural attractions of Barnafoss and Hraunfossar waterfalls as well as the caves of Víðgelmir and Surtshellir.
There are also many exciting hiking trails to be experienced in the area, as well as the more organized tours on offer to see the glaciers Eiríksjökull or Langjökull, and excursions across the Arnarvatnsheiði highland or all the south across the Kaldidalur highland.

In the olden days, back when the main route from the northern part of Iceland to the south lay across Arnarvatnsheiði, Húsafell would find itself to be an oasis of food and lodgings for weary travellers making their way across this country highway. Húsafell was indeed a popular stopover for many overnight visitors in the not so distant past, and lately, the idea of laying a country highway from Húsafell and across Stórisandur up to the North Country has resurfaced, albeit with today&#x27;s motorized vehicles in mind.

Natural features in the area include the Hraunfossar, where water comes out from a lava field over a length of about 1 km. They are placed in a setting of birch wood. The trees here grow up to 4 m. The caves of another lava field, Hallmundarhraun are also not too far away (e.g. the Surtshellir cave).

In the 19th century, there was a colony of artists living at Húsafell. One of these was the Icelandic painter Jóhannes S. Kjarval.
Today, the sculptor Páll Guðmundsson, a descendant of the Húsafell, lives and works at creating interesting faces which he cuts out of local stone. The Húsafell Stone, a rock stored in a sheep pen built by pastor Snorri Björnsson, is a legendary lifting stone which has been used in international competitions.

<text>Art has existed in Iceland since the first settlements, but it was only at the beginning of the 20th century that Icelandic artists came to an international reputation. Mostly, they had studied in other countries, e.g. in Denmark.

The most important motifs for Icelandic painters were the nature of their home country and the human being, but they also used mythical and supernatural themes as well as socio-realistic motives.

Around 1960 the Swiss-German artist Dieter Roth moved to Iceland. His engagement with the Icelandic art scene was of great importance in introducing movements such as conceptual art, Fluxus, happenings, body art, life art and social sculpture, which since have formed a basis for Icelandic Contemporary Art.

<doc id="698137" wikidata="Q448208" url="?curid=698137" title="Ann Dvorak">
<text>Ann Dvorak (born Anna McKim; August 2, 1911 – December 10, 1979) was an American stage and film actress.

Asked how to pronounce her adopted surname, she told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; in 1936: &quot;My fake name is properly pronounced &quot;vor&#x27;shack&quot;. The &quot;D&quot; remains silent. I have had quite a time with the name, having been called practically everything from Balzac to Bickelsrock.&quot;

==Early years==
Dvorak was the daughter and only child of silent film actress Anna Lehr and director Edwin McKim. While in New York, she attended St. Catherine&#x27;s Convent. After moving to California, she attended Page School for Girls in Hollywood.

She made her film debut when she was five years old in the silent film version of &quot;Ramona&quot; (1916), credited as &quot;Baby Anna Lehr.&quot; She continued in children&#x27;s roles in &quot;The Man Hater&quot; (1917) and &quot;Five Dollar Plate&quot; (1920), but then stopped acting in films. Her parents separated in 1916 and divorced in 1920; she did not see her father again until 13 years later, when she made a public plea to the press to help her find him.

==Career==

In the late 1920s, Dvorak worked as an assistant choreographer to Sammy Lee at MGM and gradually began to appear on film uncredited usually as a chorus girl or in bit parts. Her friend, actress Karen Morley, introduced her to millionaire movie producer Howard Hughes, who groomed her as a dramatic actress. She was a success in such pre-Code films as &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932) as Paul Muni&#x27;s sister; in &quot;Three on a Match&quot; (1932) with Bette Davis and Joan Blondell as the doomed, unstable Vivian; in &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; (1932) with James Cagney; and in &quot;Sky Devils&quot; (1932) opposite Spencer Tracy. Known for her style and elegance, she was a popular leading lady for Warner Bros. during the 1930s, and appeared in numerous contemporary romances and melodramas.

At age 19, Dvorak eloped with Leslie Fenton, her English co-star from &quot;The Strange Love of Molly Louvain&quot; (1932), and they married on March 17, 1932. They left for a year-long honeymoon in spite of her contractual obligations to the studio, which led to a period of litigation and pay disputes during which she discovered she was making the same amount of money as the boy who played her son in &quot;Three on a Match&quot;. She completed her contract on permanent suspension, then worked as a freelancer. Although she worked regularly, the quality of her scripts declined sharply.

She appeared as secretary Della Street to Donald Woods&#x27; Perry Mason in &quot;The Case of the Stuttering Bishop&quot; (1937). With her then-husband, Leslie Fenton, Dvorak traveled to England where she supported the war effort by working as an ambulance driver and acted in several British films. She appeared as a saloon singer in &quot;Abilene Town&quot; with Randolph Scott and Edgar Buchanan, released in 1946. The following year she adeptly handled comedy by giving an assured performance in &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1947). In 1948, Dvorak gave her only performance on Broadway in &quot;The Respectful Prostitute&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dvorak&#x27;s marriage to Fenton ended in divorce in 1946. In 1947, she married Igor Dega, a Russian dancer who danced with her briefly in &quot;The Bachelor&#x27;s Daughters&quot;. The marriage ended two years later.

Dvorak retired from the screen in 1952, when she married her final husband, Nicholas Wade, to whom she remained married until his death in 1975. She had no children. In 1959, she and her husband moved to Hawaii, which she had always loved.

Several weeks before her death, she suffered severe stomach pains. She was diagnosed with terminal cancer. She died on December 10, 1979, aged 68, in Honolulu. She was cremated and her ashes scattered off Waikiki Beach.

==Legacy==
Dvorak has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6321 Hollywood Boulevard for her contribution to motion pictures. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.

<text>Aronia is a genus of deciduous shrubs, the chokeberries, in the family Rosaceae native to eastern North America and most commonly found in wet woods and swamps. The genus Aronia is considered to have 3 species. The most common and widely used is &quot;Aronia melanocarpa&quot; (black chokeberry) which emerged from Eastern North America. The lesser known &quot;Aronia arbutifolia&quot; (red chokeberry) and the hybrid form of the abovementioned species called &quot;Aronia prunifolia&quot; (purple chokeberry) were first cultivated in Central and Eastern North America. In the eighteenth century, the first shrubs of the best-known species &quot;Aronia melanocarpa&quot; reached Europe where they were first cultivated in Scandinavia and Russia.

Chokeberries are cultivated as an ornamental plant and as a food plant. The sour berries, or aronia berries, can be eaten fresh off the bush, but are more frequently processed. They can be used to make wine, jam, syrup, juice, soft spreads, tea, salsa, extracts, beer, ice cream, gummies, and tinctures. The name &quot;chokeberry&quot; comes from the astringency of the fruits, which create the sensation of making one&#x27;s mouth pucker.
Chokeberries are often mistakenly called chokecherries, the common name for &quot;Prunus virginiana&quot;. Further adding to the ambiguity, a variety of &quot;Prunus virginiana&quot; is &quot;melanocarpa&quot;, and readily confused with black chokeberry because it is commonly referred to as &quot;black chokeberry&quot; or &quot;aronia&quot;. Aronia berries and chokecherries both contain polyphenolic compounds, such as anthocyanins, yet the two plants are somewhat distantly related within the Amygdaloideae subfamily. Black chokeberry is grown as a common shrub in Central Europe where it is mainly used for food production.

==Identification and taxonomy==
The leaves are alternate, simple, and oblanceolate with crenate margins and pinnate venation; in autumn, the leaves turn a bold red color. Dark trichomes are present on the upper midrib surface. The flowers are small, with five petals and five sepals, and produced in corymbs of 10–25 together. The hypanthium is urn-shaped. The fruit is a small pome, with an astringent flavor.

&quot;Aronia&quot; has been thought to be closely related to &quot;Photinia&quot;, and has been included in that genus in some classifications, but botanist Cornelis Kalkman observed that a combined genus should be under the older name &quot;Aronia&quot;. The combined genus contains about 65 species. In 2004, Kalkman expressed doubt about the monophyly of the combined group, and new molecular studies confirm this. They do not place these two genera together or even near one another.

In eastern North America, two well-known species are named after their fruit color, red chokeberry and black chokeberry, plus a purple chokeberry whose origin is a natural hybrid of the two. What has been regarded as a fourth species, &quot;Aronia mitschurinii&quot;, that apparently originated in cultivation, is now treated as × &quot;Sorbaronia fallax&quot;.


== Nutrition ==
== Cultivation ==

=== Soil and climate requirements ===
The chokeberry is a characteristic shrub of the northern hemisphere. Its climatic requirements are temperate and cool temperatures. The shrubs are extremely winter hardy and can survive temperatures down to –30 °C without damage if they are in winter dormancy. After flowers form in late April/early May, the plants become sensitive to frost. Chokeberries are usually planted in early spring after thaw but autumn is also possible if the plantation is mulched or snow covered during frost.

The chokeberry has a shallow and compact root system and thrives in humus and nutrient rich soils that are frost free, unflooded and with a rather low groundwater level. While the plant is moisture-loving, it also tolerates dry periods. Depending on the timing and intensity, these dry periods are yield limiting. While the crop needs more than 500 mm of precipitation, good yields can be obtained at 700–800 mm. Furthermore, chokeberries are sun loving and usually thrive better under direct sunlight rather than in shade.

=== Seedbed requirements and sowing ===
Chokeberries grows on medium-heavy soils, which can be neutral to slightly acidic. Before planting, it is advisable to promote soil structure and humus formation, which can be enhanced by green manuring using organic fertilizers and deep tillage of the soil. Planting chokeberries in an existing grass plot is not recommended, due to the strong competition of weeds in the understock area. Commonly, two-to-three-year-old bare-root plants are set between October and November. Machine planting places about 3000 seedlings per hectare, each 20–25 cm deep into the soil. Plant distance is 60 cm and row distance is given by the harvest machine.

=== Crop sequence requirements ===
If chokeberries are planted directly after a previous cultivation of other Rosaceae, an intercrop such as cereals is recommended, as well as staggered row planting, since chokeberries might suffer from a replant disease (also: soil fatigue).

=== Cultivation management ===
For the first two years, much attention should be given to keeping the understock area clear during maintenance. The understock maintenance can be done by machine hacking or by using a string trimmer with protection. Covering the plant strip with mulch also helps to minimize weeds. When maintaining the alley, it is important to cut it every 3–4 weeks. 
The young plants are sensitive to drought stress, so proper watering should be guaranteed. At the beginning the plant needs to put its energy into vegetative growth, therefore it helps to remove flower buds. In order to achieve a balanced fruit quality in the long term, the plant, which grows as a shrub, should be trimmed regularly. Furthermore, uniform plant stands are easier to manage and harvest by machine. As a rule, chokeberry branches achieve the highest yields in the 5-6 year period, so cutting is not done again until the 7th year.

The aim of both the mechanical and the manual cutting system, is to let the shrubs grow into a closed hedge. While in the mechanical cutting the whole plant is cut back to a few centimeters above the ground every 6th year during the winter dormancy. The manual cutting removes the oldest shoots, the weak annual shoots and those shoots that are inside the cane slightly above the base of the cane in the winter dormancy. In the case of manual cutting, the ages of 1-6 year old shoots should be present in equal proportions after cutting, thus the chokeberry forms robust shoots and allows uniform harvests from year to year.

=== Fertilization requirements ===
For optimal fertilization, collecting soil samples before the planting of the seedlings is required. The soil analysis enables planning of effective fertilizer applications. In the first two years, after planting the seedlings, there must be enough nutrients in the soil so that the seedlings can grow optimally, including phosphate (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) and, therefore, they should be present at the beginning of vegetation period. When potassium levels in the soil are low, the nutrients can be supplied via cattle manure and cattle slurry. If the potassium content in the soil is high, it is better to use compost, since a too high potassium concentration inhibits the uptake of magnesium, calcium and ammonium. However, there is no need to be too sensitive about potassium levels in the first few years, since a high amount is basically needed. It is clear that nitrogen fertilization is necessary. Often, one half is applied at the beginning of vegetation period and the other half at flowering. Since the plant already has a greater growth potential in the second year, the amounts of fertilizer can be increased a little. From the third year on, the chokeberry has the full nutrient requirement. Depending on the vigor, wood maturity and yield, the fertilizer quantities can be slightly adjusted upwards or downwards. Through the targeted strip fertilization, the amount of fertilizer can be reduced by 1/3, which may be of economic interest to the cultivator.

===Breeding===
One part of the breeding efforts focuses on improving red chokeberries for their use as ornamental plants. Breeding goals include the reduction of the plants stature, reduction of its tendency towards legginess, increasing the fruit size and improving leaf retention for a longer lasting fall foliage. Breeding of the red chokeberry is difficult, because the available accessions are tetraploid plants and thus, are likely to produce apomictic seeds. Furthermore, the breeding of polyploids makes mutation breeding more challenging because the additional sets of chromosome can mask incomplete mutations. If breeders had access to a wild diploid &quot;A. arbutifolia&quot; breeding would arguably become more successful.

The breeding success of the black chokeberry for food production in Europe and Russia has been restricted because the genetic pool of the domesticated Russian plants is homogeneous. Breeding efforts aim to increase the content of polyphenol compounds while maintaining or increasing the fruit size. Further breeding targets are improvement of flavor.

=== Harvest and post-harvest treatment ===
The continuous monitoring of fruit development helps to determine the specific time of harvest. To monitor the fruit development about 200 berries per hectare are removed, mixed and pressed into juice. From this juice the sugar content can be measured, which should be between 15 and 20° Brix, because only then the sugar content is high enough to overtone the tannins in taste.

The harvest of the chokeberry takes place between the end of August and the beginning of September. In this time span, there are fruits of different ripeness on the shrub. While the upper part is often already ripe, the lower part is not yet edible. A recommended harvest time is when the upper berries begin to shrivel slightly, but do not yet show any weight loss. In this way, a large part can be harvested in an optimal ripening state while the other part can still post-ripen.

Harvesting is done by hand, especially for fresh sales and the production of dried berries, where the appearance of the berries is important. The majority of other harvesting is done by machine. In manual harvesting, cleanly harvested fruits are stored in bunches. Thus, about 7 kg can be picked by hand per working hour. It is important that the berries are processed the same day to keep the quality high. For mechanical harvesting, the bushes are pulled in sideways by the harvesting machine and the berries are knocked off with sticks. Machine harvesting requires three people and the machine can harvest one hectare in one day. In the case of mechanical harvesting, many berries are injured after harvesting and in any case should be processed the same day.

=== Yield ===
After growing chokeberries from seeds it takes between 3 and 5 years until the plants begin to yield fruits. However, from a parent plant up to 20 rooted plants can be derived which already start yielding after 2 to 3 years. After the plants are fully matured a well growing plantation can yield between 3 and 12 tonnes of chokeberry fruits per hectare.

== Pests and diseases ==
Chokeberries have a low susceptibility to plant diseases and only little problems with pests. Their resistance makes chokeberries a well suited crop for organic agriculture. The high content of flavonoids in the fruits and their acidic taste are likely to protect the chokeberry against pathogens and pests.

Here is a list of some possible pests and diseases of chokeberries:

Pests

* Aphids e.g., apple aphid (&quot;Aphis pomi&quot;), woolly aphid (&quot;Eriosoma lanigerum&quot;)
* Mites e.g., leaf blister mite (&quot;Eriophyes piri&quot;)
* Drosophila suzukii – some studies found that Drosophila suzukii mainly infests damaged or destemmed fruits, while intact fruits are more resistant
* Tooth-nose snout weevils (Rhynchitidae)
* Wasps
* Cockchafer grub
* Codling moth
Also, birds, mice and deer might feed on different parts of the chokeberry and thereby damage the plant.

Fungal diseases

* Dead arm disease (Phomopsis viticola)
* Rusts (Pucciniales)
* Powdry mildew (Erysiphales)

Bacterial diseases

* Pseudomonas syringae
*An infection with fire blight is theoretically possible, as chokeberries belong to the family of Rosaceae, but has so far not been observed.

The treatment methods for the different pests and diseases differ depending on the chosen agricultural practice (e.g. organic vs. conventional agriculture). Often mechanical measures can be taken such as ensuring sufficient sunlight and aeration between the plants or spanning nets as a protection against picking birds.

== Products and uses ==

The chokeberries are attractive ornamental plants for gardens. They are naturally understory and woodland edge plants, and grow well when planted under trees. Chokeberries are resistant to drought, insects, pollution, and disease. A number of cultivars, including &quot;A. arbutifolia&quot; &#x27;Brilliant&#x27; and &quot;A. melanocarpa&quot; &#x27;Autumn magic&#x27;, have been selected for their striking autumn leaf color.

An aronia wine is made in Lithuania and Minnesota. In Poland, aronia berries are added to jams and juices or dried to make an herbal tea sometimes blended with other ingredients, such as blackcurrant. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the berries are sold fresh and frozen or made into juices, jams and teas. Aronia is also used as a flavoring or colorant for beverages or yogurts. Juice from the ripe berries is astringent, semi-sweet (moderate sugar content), sour (low pH), and contains a low level of vitamin C. The berries have a tart flavor and, in addition to juice, can be baked into breads. In the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, aronia juice concentrate is used in manufactured juice blends.

==Polyphenols==
&quot;A. melanocarpa&quot; (black chokeberry) has attracted scientific interest due to its deep purple, almost black pigmentation that arises from dense contents of polyphenols, especially anthocyanins. Total polyphenol content is 1752 mg per 100 g dry weight, anthocyanin content is 1480 mg per 100 g dry weight, and proanthocyanidin concentration is 664 mg per 100 g fresh weight. These values are among the highest measured in plants to date. The black aronia species contains higher levels of anthocyanins than purple (&quot;Aronia prunifolia&quot;) or red aronia (&quot;Aronia arbutifolia&quot;), whereas red and purple aronia are richer in phenolic acid and proanthocyanins.

The plant produces these pigments mainly in the leaves and skin of the berries to protect the pulp and seeds from constant exposure to ultraviolet radiation and production of free radicals. By absorbing UV rays in the blue-purple spectrum, leaf and skin pigments filter intense sunlight, serve antioxidant functions and thereby have a role assuring regeneration of the species. Brightly colorful pigmentation also attracts birds and other animals to consume the fruit and disperse the seeds in their droppings.

Analysis of polyphenols in chokeberries has identified the following individual chemicals (among hundreds known to exist in the plant kingdom): cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, quercetin-3-glycoside, epicatechin, caffeic acid, delphinidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin. All these except caffeic acid are members of the flavonoid category of phenolics.

For reference to phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and similar plant-derived phytochemicals, Wikipedia has a list of phytochemicals and foods in which they are prominent.

<text>Béla Kiss (; ; c. 1877 – after 4 October 1916) was a Hungarian serial killer. He is thought to have murdered at least 23 young women and one man, and attempted to pickle their bodies in large metal drums that he kept on his property.

== Background ==

Béla Kiss was born in Izsák, Austria-Hungary to János Kiss and Verona Varga. At a young age, Kiss possibly had an incestuous relationship with his mother.

A tinsmith, Béla Kiss lived in Cinkota (then a town near Budapest, now a neighborhood within the city itself) from 1900 on. According to Magyar Nemzet in 1907: &quot;Béla Kiss, a tinsmith in Cinkota, unmarried, lives in a furnished apartment, has his own business as a tinsmith, is regularly employed by his business partners. He is of good character, he is not in debt, he was not insolvent, he always fulfills his obligations, his lifestyle is solid, can be offered for credit.&quot; 

He was an amateur astrologer and allegedly fond of occult practices. Kiss was married twice, and had two children, Aranka and Ilonka. In 1912, Kiss hired a housekeeper, Mrs. Jakubec, after his wife had reportedly abandoned him for a lover.

Jakubec noticed that Kiss corresponded with a number of women, typically through advertisements he would place in newspapers offering his services as either a matrimonial agent or a fortune teller, and sometimes brought the women individually to his home. However, his housekeeper had little contact with the women.

Kiss was never on intimate terms with his neighbors, even though he was well-liked. Townsfolk also noticed that Kiss had collected a number of metal drums. When the town police questioned him about the drums, he told them that he filled them with gasoline in order to prepare for rationing in the oncoming war.

When World War I began in 1914, he was conscripted and left his house in Jakubec&#x27;s care.
== Criminal activity ==
According to an article published in Népszava on 10 May 1916, referring to a &quot;police inspector&#x27;s report&quot;, Márton Kresinszky, the owner of the house rented by Kiss, wanted to renovate the building, so he went to Cinkota, where Kiss&#x27;s neighbour, an old acquaintance of Kresinszky, Béla Takács, a pharmacist, told him that Kiss had gone to war in 1914. In search of material for redecoration, the two men went to the chamber next to Kiss&#x27;s workshop, where Takács said there had been a large quantity of reeds. In the chamber they found seven tin drums, stacked one metre long and fifty centimetres wide. The airtight top of the top barrel, sealed with lead, had been loosened with an axe and, when it was pried open, a terrible stench emanated from it. After the tin barrel top was removed, a bag was found and pulled out of the cylinder. A woman&#x27;s body was found sewn into the bag. Another barrel was also punctured, from which a corpse smell emanated and a lock of blonde hair fell out. Kresinszky and Takács then informed the authorities. Gyula Huszka, the chief notary, together with police officers, found a female body in each of the seven barrels. A search of Kiss&#x27; house resulted in a total of 24 bodies. Famed Austria-Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy was present and described the following:

Nagy informed the military that they should arrest Kiss immediately, if he was still alive; there was also a possibility that he was a prisoner of war. His name, unfortunately, was very common. Nagy also arrested Jakubec and asked the postal service to hold any possible letters to Kiss, in case he had an accomplice who could warn him. Nagy initially suspected that Jakubec might have had something to do with the murders, especially since Kiss had left her money in his will. Jakubec assured police that she knew absolutely nothing about the murders. She showed them a secret and locked room that Kiss had told her never to enter. The room was filled with bookcases and had a desk, which held a number of letters, Kiss&#x27; correspondence with 74 women, and a photo album. Many of the books were about poisons or strangulation. From the letters, Nagy discerned several things. The oldest of the letters were from 1903, and it became clear that Kiss was defrauding the women—usually middle-aged—who had been looking for marriage. He had placed ads in the marriage columns of several newspapers and had selected mainly women who had no relatives living nearby and knew no one who would quickly notice their disappearance. He wooed them and convinced them to send him money. Police also found old court records that indicated that two of his victims had initiated court proceedings because he had taken money from them. Both women had disappeared, and the cases had been dismissed.

Each woman who came to the house was strangled. Kiss pickled their corpses in alcohol and sealed them in the airtight metal drums. Police found that the bodies had puncture marks on their necks and that their bodies were drained of blood, which led them to believe that Kiss may have been practicing vampirism.

== Escape ==
On 4 October 1916, Nagy received a letter that stated that Kiss was recuperating in a Serbian hospital. However, Nagy arrived at the hospital too late; Kiss had fled and left the corpse of another soldier in his bed. Nagy alerted all the Hungarian police, but all the alleged sightings police investigated were false.

== Sightings ==
On several later occasions, speculation arose that Kiss had perhaps faked his death by exchanging identities with a dead soldier named Mackaree during the war. He was reportedly sighted numerous times in the following years. Various rumors circulated as to his actual fate, including that he had been imprisoned for burglary in Romania or he had died of yellow fever in Turkey. In 1920, a soldier in the French Foreign Legion reported on another legionnaire named Hoffman, the name Kiss had used in some of his letters, who had boasted how good he was at using a garrote and who fit Kiss&#x27; description. &quot;Hoffman&quot; deserted before police could reach him.

The last known supposed sighting occurred in New York City in 1932. That year, homicide detective Henry Oswald was certain he had observed Kiss emerging from the New York City Subway at Times Square, Manhattan. There were also rumors that Kiss was living in the city and working as a janitor, although these could not be verified. When the police went to interview the janitor, he had already left.

Kiss&#x27; eventual fate and exact number of victims remain unknown.

<doc id="698149" wikidata="Q2350394" url="?curid=698149" title="Fallacy of four terms">
<text>The fallacy of four terms () is the formal fallacy that occurs when a syllogism has four (or more) terms rather than the requisite three, rendering it invalid.

== Definition==
Categorical syllogisms always have three terms:
:Major premise: Weapons are dangerous.
:Minor premise: Knives are weapons.
:Conclusion: Knives are dangerous.

Here, the three terms are: &quot;weapon&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, and &quot;knife&quot;.

Using four terms invalidates the syllogism:

:Major premise: Weapons are dangerous.
:Minor premise: Balloons are round.
:Conclusion: Balloons are dangerous.

Notice that there are four terms: &quot;weapon&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;balloon&quot;, and &quot;round&quot;. The two premises do not connect &quot;balloons&quot; with &quot;dangerous&quot;, so the reasoning is invalid. Two premises are not enough to connect four different terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term common to both premises. 

In everyday reasoning, the fallacy of four terms occurs most frequently by equivocation: using the same word or phrase but with a different meaning each time, creating a fourth term even though only three distinct words are used. The resulting argument sounds like the (valid) first example above, but is in fact structured like the invalid second example:

:Major premise: Nothing is better than eternal happiness.
:Minor premise: A ham sandwich is better than nothing.
:Conclusion: A ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.

The word &quot;nothing&quot; in the example above has two meanings, as presented: &quot;nothing is better&quot; means the thing being named has the highest value possible (there exists nothing better); &quot;better than nothing&quot; means only that the thing being described has some value (more than the implied zero value of nothing). Therefore, &quot;nothing&quot; acts as two different terms in this example, thus creating the fallacy of four terms.

The fallacy of four terms also applies to syllogisms that contain five or six terms.

==Reducing terms==
Sometimes a syllogism that is apparently fallacious because it is stated with more than three terms can be translated into an equivalent, valid three term syllogism. For example:

:Major premise: No humans are immortal.
:Minor premise: All Greeks are people.
:Conclusion: All Greeks are mortal.

This EAE-1 syllogism apparently has five terms: &quot;humans&quot;, &quot;immortal&quot;, &quot;Greeks&quot;, &quot;people&quot;, and &quot;mortal&quot;. But it can be rewritten as a standard form AAA-1 syllogism by first substituting the synonymous term &quot;humans&quot; for &quot;people&quot; and then by reducing the complementary term &quot;immortal&quot; in the first premise using the immediate inference known as obversion (that is, the statement &quot;No humans are immortal.&quot; is equivalent to the statement &quot;All humans are mortal.&quot;).

==Classification==
The fallacy of four terms is a syllogistic fallacy. Types of syllogism to which it applies include statistical syllogism, hypothetical syllogism, and categorical syllogism, all of which must have exactly three terms. Because it applies to the argument&#x27;s form, as opposed to the argument&#x27;s content, it is classified as a formal fallacy.

Equivocation of the middle term is a frequently cited source of a fourth term being added to a syllogism; both of the equivocation examples above affect the middle term of the syllogism. Consequently this common error itself has been given its own name: the fallacy of the ambiguous middle. An argument that commits the ambiguous middle fallacy blurs the line between formal and informal (material) fallacies, however it is usually considered an informal fallacy because the argument&#x27;s form appears valid.

<text>In Your House was a series of professional wrestling supercard events created by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The events originally aired on pay-per-view (PPV) from May 1995 to February 1999 when the promotion was still called the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; renamed WWE in 2002). In 2020, WWE revived In Your House for its developmental brand NXT. The 2020 event was streamed exclusively on the WWE Network with the 2021 event also available via traditional PPV and the livestreaming service Peacock, while the 2022 event was only available via WWE&#x27;s livestreaming platforms. A total of 30 In Your House events were held between May 1995 and June 2022.

The original concept of the In Your House series was that in the months when the promotion was not holding one of its then-five major PPV events (WrestleMania, SummerSlam, King of the Ring, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series), it would offer a two-hour PPV for a lower price. In Your House was established in response to a move by competitor World Championship Wrestling to increase its annual PPV events. The In Your House branding was retired following February 1999&#x27;s St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House event, as the company moved to install permanent names for each of its monthly PPVs, which began with Backlash. After 21 years and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE revived In Your House for NXT in 2020 and it was subsequently held annually in June until its final event in 2022. The 2020 and 2021 events were held under the NXT TakeOver series, but after TakeOver&#x27;s discontinuation in late 2021, the final In Your House was a standalone event for NXT.

==History==
The first In Your House pay-per-view (PPV) was held on May 14, 1995, in Syracuse, New York at Upstate Medical University Arena (then known as Oncenter War Memorial Arena). To promote this first event, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) held a sweepstakes to give away a new house in Orlando, Florida. The original concept of In Your House was that in the months when the WWF was not holding one of its then-five major PPV events (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble, which at the time ran for three hours and retailed for US$29.95), they would offer a two-hour PPV, priced at US$14.95. The price was raised to US$19.95 starting in December 1995 with In Your House 5. The WWF did this in response to a move by competitor World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to increase their annual pay-per-view events (in 1995, WCW held 9 PPV events, then 10 in 1996, and finally started airing monthly events in 1997). Notwithstanding the addition of more WWF events, WCW&#x27;s events regularly ran between 2.5–3 hours. Starting with Ground Zero: In Your House in September 1997, the WWF expanded all of its In Your House events to three hours, thus matching the runtime of its major PPV events.

The first six In Your House events were not promoted with subtitles, which were retroactively added (shown below in the table in small print), sometimes making use of a tagline. The first event to officially use a subtitle was the seventh event, In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies. From September 1997 onwards, the subtitles replaced the In Your House label as the main titles (e.g., the PPV was not named &quot;In Your House: Ground Zero&quot;, but instead, &quot;Ground Zero: In Your House&quot;), until regular named shows such as Backlash took over in 1999. The In Your House branding was retired following February 1999&#x27;s St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House event, as the company moved to install permanent names for each of its monthly events, which began with Backlash. Early advertising for that year&#x27;s Backlash featured the &quot;In Your House&quot; branding until it was quietly dropped in the weeks leading to the pay-per-view. Following this, several of the In Your House shows were rebranded as their own PPV chronologies, including Over the Edge, Fully Loaded, Unforgiven, No Way Out, Judgment Day, and Bad Blood.

In 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and in 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name, with WWE becoming an orphaned initialism. On May 13, 2020, WWE announced that the In Your House branding would be revived for the NXT brand division as an NXT TakeOver event entitled TakeOver: In Your House on June 7, which aired exclusively on WWE&#x27;s online streaming service, the WWE Network. The announcement and the event marked the 25th anniversary of the first In Your House PPV. The event featured homages to the WWF in the early 90&#x27;s, including a recreation of the house-themed stage used during the earlier In Your House events, and Adam Cole appearing in a parody of the commercials for ICOPRO bodybuilding supplements. A second TakeOver: In Your House was scheduled for June 13, 2021, thus making In Your House an annual subseries of TakeOver events. This second event aired on both the WWE Network and traditional pay-per-view, thus returning In Your House to pay-per-view. It also aired on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March 2021, thus being the first In Your House to air on Peacock.

In September 2021, NXT was rebranded as NXT 2.0, returning it to its original function as WWE&#x27;s developmental brand, and the NXT TakeOver series was subsequently discontinued. The 2022 event was in turn held without the TakeOver branding, and it only aired on WWE&#x27;s livestreaming platforms as NXT&#x27;s events ceased airing on traditional pay-per-view that year. This would be the final In Your House as another event was not scheduled for 2023.

<doc id="698159" wikidata="Q5420750" url="?curid=698159" title="Expanded Psionics Handbook">
<text>The Expanded Psionics Handbook is a sourcebook written by Bruce Cordell for the 3.5 edition of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy roleplaying game that contains rules and options for integrating psychic powers (also known as psionics) into the game. Along with its predecessor, the &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot;, the &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; expands and adapts the psionics concept with a new emphasis on balance and playability.

== Contents ==

The &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; contains a system for adding psionics to Dungeons and Dragons. Psionics use a different system from traditional D&amp;D spellcasting, using a point pool to track a character&#x27;s power usage.

The &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; introduces four Base Classes, several prestige classes alters some rules and includes a new system for becoming psionically focused. The base classes are the psion and psychic warrior (both of which are reprints from the Psionics Handbook), the wilder, and the Soulknife. The prestige classes are the Cerebremancer, Elocater, Fist of Zuoken, Illithid Slayer, Metamind, Psion Uncarnate, Pyrokineticist, Thrallherd and the War Mind.

The &quot;Handbook&quot; also contains four new psionic races—the dromites, elan, maenads, and xelphs—provides psionic versions of dwarves, githyanki, githzerai, and yuan-ti. It adds several new psionic monsters, including the intellect devourer and temporal filcher, and adds the phrenic template, which can make any Dungeons and Dragons creature a psionic creature.

== Publication history ==

The &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot; was published in 2004. Cover art was by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Brian Despain, Wayne England, Lars Grant-West, Heather Hudson, Jeremy Jarvis, Chuck Lukacs, David Martin, Monte Moore, Jim Pavelec, Wayne Reynolds, Arnie Swekel and Sam Wood.

This book is intended as a 3.5 adaptation and revision of the &quot;Psionics Handbook&quot; for 3rd Edition, which was released in 2001. It was adapted for several reasons, including changes to the core D20 system and balance concerns. Some players considered psions to be weaker than wizards and sorcerers.

== Reception ==

The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; found the book&#x27;s prestige classes &quot;more imaginative, with beings who leave their physical form behind for a life of mental existence, hunters who kill illithids, and the irresistibly heroic Fist of Zuoken&quot;.

Other reviewers, such as RPGnet, were less positive. Reviewer Jesse Heinig said, &quot;As an expansion for all manner of psionic-themed characters, the Complete Psionic book provides more depth and more unusual powers. Sadly, it lacks a little in breadth and some of its last-minute changes are evident around the frayed edges.&quot;

<doc id="698166" wikidata="Q2103867" url="?curid=698166" title="Pontiac Tempest">
<text>The Tempest is an automobile that was produced by Pontiac from 1960 to 1970, and again from 1987 to 1991.

The Tempest was introduced as an entry-level compact in October 1960 at the Paris Auto Show for the 1961 model year. Built on GM&#x27;s first unibody chassis, its new Y-platform was shared with the Buick Special/Skylark and Oldsmobile F-85/Cutlass.

While the Buick and Olds versions used a conventional drivetrain, the Pontiac had a unique, innovative design. The Tempest featured a front-engine/rear-transaxle layout that very nearly resulted in an ideal 50/50 weight distribution, together with independent rear suspension for nimble handling (a swing axle design similar to the Chevy Corvair). A Slant-4 engine connected to the 2-speed automatic transaxle via a flexible &quot;rope&quot; drive shaft. This configuration eliminated the driveshaft hump, yielding a flat floor with increased interior space. The Pontiac &quot;Trophy-4&quot; was also unique, created by basically halving a standard Pontiac V8 block. 

Buick&#x27;s aluminum 215 V8 was also optional in 1961 and 1962, but very few Tempests were so equipped. The Tempest line offered an optional LeMans trim upgrade. 

In 1964 the Tempest was redesigned as a mid-size car on the updated GM A-body platform, which used a conventional drivetrain. The base Tempest, Tempest Custom, and Lemans became separate trim packages, with an optional GTO performance option available on the LeMans for 1964 and 1965. The GTO was offered as a separate model line beginning in 1966. The Tempest name was retired after 1970, replaced by the T-37 as the base model, which in turn gave way to the LeMans name in 1972.

In Canada from 1987 to 1991, Pontiac marketed a rebadged version of the compact L-body Chevrolet Corsica under the revived &quot;Tempest&quot; name. 
==First generation (1961–1963)==

The Tempest was the result of a decision by the Pontiac division to enter the compact car market following the success of the Chevrolet Corvair. The division wanted to produce a clone of the Corvair, but instead GM gave Pontiac the lead to develop a new car in an interdivisional program coded named &quot;X-100.&quot; John Z. DeLorean, Pontiac&#x27;s chief engineer and general manager, went to work on a car that would meld components GM already produced. His objective was for the new model to be more than just an ordinary compact car. The Tempest was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1961 Car of the Year. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; praised the Tempest as &quot;exceptionally roomy&quot; and &quot;one of the very best utility cars since the Ford Model A.&quot; In hindsight, DeLorean admitted that the Tempest was &quot;less than successful,&quot; adding, &quot;there was no mechanical problem, but the car rattled so loudly that it sounded like it was carrying half-a-trunkful of rolling rocks.&quot;
It shared sheet metal with the Oldsmobile F-85, the first-generation Tempest had several features that differentiated it from the other compact GM cars. The engine was a 195 cubic inch (3.2 L) straight-4 marketed as the &quot;Trophy 4,&quot; derived from the right cylinder bank of Pontiac&#x27;s 389 cubic inch &quot;Trophy 8&quot; V8 engine. The Tempest featured a drivetrain with a rear-mounted transaxle that was coupled to a torque shaft arcing in a downward bow within a curved, longitudinal tunnel. Use of the torque shaft was the result of being forced to use the Corvair floorpan which, being a rear engine platform, had no drive shaft. To combine flexibility with strength in the proper proportion, the shaft was forged of SAE 8660 steel (high nickel, chrome and molybdenum alloying percentages) for torsion bar specifications. For automatic cars, the shaft was in diameter and long, while the manual-box shaft was by . This joined the forward engine and the rear transaxle (therefore no transmission hump) into a single unit, helping to reduce vibration. The design, known as &quot;rope drive,&quot; had been seen previously only on General Motors&#x27; 1951 Le Sabre concept car.

The combination of a rear-mounted transaxle and front-mounted engine very nearly gave the car an ideal 50/50 front/rear weight distribution. This, along with a four-wheel independent suspension, helped make the Tempest a nimble-handling car for the era. The front engine/rear transaxle design also eliminated the driveshaft/transmission tunnel in the front of the passenger compartment, while lowering the driveshaft tunnel in the rear compared with a conventional front engine/front transmission layout.

The Trophy 4 four-cylinder engine was promoted for its economy, but Pontiac also saved money on its assembly: Because it was based on the right cylinder bank of the Pontiac 389 V8 engine, both engines could be built on the same assembly line. There were three versions of the Trophy 4: An economy version with a relatively low 8.6:1 compression ratio and a single-barrel carburetor; a hotter version with a 10.25:1 compression ratio and a single-barrel carburetor; and the most powerful Trophy 4 engine, which had a 10.25:1 compression ratio and a four-barrel carburetor. While both Trophy 4 engines (low and high compression) equipped with single-barrel carburetors produced , the high-compression, four-barrel Trophy 4 engine produced at 4,800 RPM and of torque at 2,800 RPM (all ratings are SAE Gross). The three Trophy 4 engine versions offered fuel economy ratings ranging from 18 to 22 MPG. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; reported fuel economy of 21.3 MPG at 60 MPH.

The Trophy 4 engine was generally reliable, but could be harsh when it was out of tune, due to its inherent lack of secondary balance and absence of balancer shafts.

The Tempest was offered with quite a few options such as air conditioning, transistor radios, windshield washers, a parking brake warning light, padded safety dash, child-proof door locks, and dealer-installed seat belts, as such restraints were not yet Federally required at the Tempest&#x27;s introduction.
Another departure from the other Y-body cars was the Tempest&#x27;s brake drum, which used five studs on the same bolt circle (&quot;five-on-four-and-a-half&quot;) and wheels - a configuration unique among General Motors cars. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had standardized their Y-body cars on an odd brake drum with four lug studs on a -diameter circle (a &quot;four-on-four-and-a-half&quot; bolt pattern), with wheels. This arrangement was also not used by other General Motors cars at the time.

Along with the Trophy 4 engine line another optional engine for the Tempest in 1961 and 1962 was the innovative aluminum Buick-built 215 cubic inch (3.5 L) V8. It is estimated that just 3,662 Tempests were ordered with the 215 engine, or about 1% of production. This engine produced, in its various incarnations, from despite weighing just installed.

The engine blocks used for 215-V8 engines installed in Tempest models were distinct from 215-V8 engine blocks used in other models because, in addition to Buick factory markings, they were also hand-stamped at the Pontiac plant with the Vehicle Identification Numbers of the individual vehicles that they were installed in. Thus, in 1961, all Pontiac 215 engine blocks begin with &quot;161P&quot;; for 1962 the stamping began with &quot;162P&quot;. Further code numbers indicated the car&#x27;s transmission (manual or automatic).

In 1961, the transmission choices were a three-speed column-shifted manual with a non-synchronized first gear, or a two-speed automatic transaxle controlled by a small lever to the right of the ignition switch on the instrument panel. Called TempesTorque in company literature but unmarked on the unit itself until 1963, it was similar in concept to the Chevrolet Powerglide automatic transmission used on the Chevrolet Corvair, although few parts overlapped. For 1962, a floor-mounted, fully synchronized four-speed manual transmission became available.

At its introduction, the Tempest was available only as a four-door pillared sedan and as a station wagon that, like other Pontiac station wagons of the time, had the name Safari added to it. A pair of two-door coupes (one of which was named LeMans) were added at the end of 1961, both in the 1961 body style.
For the 1962 model year there were four Tempest models available: a sedan, a coupe, a station wagon, and a convertible. Customers wanting something fancier could opt for the LeMans trim package upgrade, which featured front bucket seats. Tempest LeMans models were available with either the coupe or the convertible; there was no LeMans sedan or station wagon. And although Oldsmobile and Buick offered pillarless hardtops on the Cutlass and Skylark respectively, Pontiac did not offer a pillarless hardtop LeMans model.

In 1963, the LeMans became a separate series; its sales were nearly 50 percent of combined Tempest and Le Mans production. 1963 models, referred to as senior compacts, were slightly larger and heavier than the 1961 and 1962 models had been. These new models featured a redesigned transaxle that improved handling, as well as a high-performance option that was much more powerful than the rarely-ordered 215-V8. This new V8 option for 1963 was Pontiac&#x27;s 326 cubic inch (5.3 L) V8, an engine with the same external dimensions as the venerable Trophy 8 389, but different internal components designed to produce more torque. A new version of the automatic transmission (now officially stamped TempesTorque on the case) was redesigned to handle the new V8&#x27;s additional torque. The four-speed manual transmission had not been redesigned, and very few V8-equipped Tempest models were built with this transmission. The three-speed manual transmission remained available for all engines.

The high-compression 326 V8 engine&#x27;s output was and of torque (SAE Gross). The actual displacement was 336 cubic inches, but according to lore, since General Motors management edict declared that no GM compact was allowed to have an engine that was larger than the Chevrolet Corvette 327 V8, the advertised displacement for the Tempest V8 was 326 cubic inches. However, for 1964, the engine&#x27;s displacement was adjusted so that it actually was 326 cubic inches, making the 1963 &quot;326 V8&quot; a single-year engine.

The cast-iron V8 engine increased the Tempest&#x27;s weight by over the weight of a Tempest equipped with a Trophy 4 engine; front/rear weight distribution changed somewhat to 54/46. Performance with a 326-powered Tempest was strong enough that &quot;Car Life&quot; magazine wrote &quot;No one will wonder why they didn&#x27;t use the 389.&quot; Fuel economy with the 326 could be as high as 19 mpg. The V8 option proved popular: 52 percent of the 131,490 Tempests and LeMans models sold in the 1963 model year were ordered with it.

===Super Duty===
Perhaps the most famous of all Tempests were the twelve 1963 &quot;Super Duty&quot; cars built to compete in the NHRA Factory Experimental class. These were assembled at the Pontiac plant in Michigan over Christmas 1962 with the knowledge of an impending General Motors ban on factory racing. Among those who successfully raced them was Wild Bill Shrewsberry, who turned low 12-second quarter-mile runs in the 1963 NHRA Winter Nationals driving for Mickey Thompson. Shrewsberry still owns his car, and it is still equipped with Pontiac&#x27;s &quot;Powershift&quot; transaxle as retrofitted later in the 1963 season. Developed specifically for the Super Duty model, this was essentially two Chevrolet Powerglide automatics in a single four-speed unit, allowing clutchless shifting in much the same manner as modern drag racing transmissions do.

On October 31, 2008, one of the rarest factory race cars, the missing Stan Antlocer Super Duty Tempest Le Mans Coupe, was auctioned on eBay. The seller started the auction at $500 being unaware of the car&#x27;s true value. Eventually, the car was sold for $226,521.

==Second generation (1964–1967)==
In 1964, the Tempest was redesigned as a more-conventional vehicle and enlarged from a compact to an intermediate-sized car with a wheelbase and an overall length of . The unibody, curved driveshaft and transaxle were gone, replaced by a traditional front engine, front transmission, body-on-frame, and solid rear axle design used by all of GM&#x27;s other cars but the Corvette and Corvair. Together with its sister cars (the Oldsmobile F-85/Cutlass and Buick Special/Skylark), the Tempest/Le Mans moved to the new A platform shared with the new Chevrolet Chevelle, and all three cars received updates and modifications standardizing them throughout—including the wheels—by GM edict. The cars were, in ascending order, base Tempest, Tempest Custom, and Le Mans.


Replacing the previous &quot;Trophy 4&quot; inline four-cylinder engine as standard equipment was a new Pontiac straight six with one-barrel carburetor and . This six was basically a smaller bore (3.75&quot;) version of the Chevrolet straight-6, offered as a Pontiac exclusive. This is one of the earliest &quot;Corporate Engine&quot; arrangements General Motors utilized.

Optional engines included two versions of the Pontiac V8 introduced the previous year: a two-barrel regular fuel option; or the 326 HO engine with four-barrel carburetor and 10.5:1 compression ratio which required premium fuel. Transmissions included a standard three-speed manual with column shift, four-speed manual with floor-mounted Hurst shifter or a two-speed automatic; the latter was a version of Buick&#x27;s Super Turbine 300.

The popularity of the high-performance 326/336 V8 in the Tempest-based LeMans package the year before prompted Pontiac to give the option a special, sporty name: the GTO, after the Italian abbreviation &quot;Gran Turismo Omologato&quot; used to designate specially equipped street cars homologated for racing (though the opposite, producing a mandated minimum of street-legal race cars to meet the homologation requirement, is the norm). Available with Pontiac&#x27;s largest V8, the , and equipped with a four-barrel carburetor (producing or the soon to become iconic 3 x 2 barrel Tri-Power set-up, the GTO proved to be the defining muscle car of the 1960s. Unlike other 1964 Tempests, the GTO was available as a pillarless hardtop coupe.

Unsurprisingly, the success of the GTO prompted Oldsmobile to rush out its own high-performance option package for the F-85/Cutlass called the 442, and the next year for Buick to release a high-performance version of the Skylark called the Skylark Gran Sport, or GS. Both cars would enjoy success and join Chevrolet&#x27;s Chevelle SS in GM&#x27;s effort to capitalize on the exploding muscle car era.

Engine offerings for the 1965 Tempest were the same as 1964, except the 326 HO was uprated to and the GTO 389&#x27;s uprated to and via higher rise intake manifolds. Styling changes included a new split grille with vertical headlights similar to the larger Pontiacs, revised taillights and a more slanted rear deck. A two-door hardtop coupe was added to the Tempest Custom line, while the Le Mans got a four-door sedan with a plush interior done in Preston Cloth trim similar to the full-sized Bonneville Brougham.

A major facelift was made on the 1966 Tempest that included more rounded bodylines with a Coke-bottle effect similar to the full-sized Pontiacs. New four-door pillarless hardtop sedans were added to the Tempest Custom line. Under the hood, the Chevy-derived 215 six was replaced by a new Pontiac overhead cam six, the only such engine found in an American production car at that time. This was also the first American-built engine to use a belt to time the camshaft to the crankshaft rather than a chain. The base OHC had a one-barrel carburetor and was rated at , designed for economy buyers. Optionally available as part of the Sprint option package on non-wagons was a four-barrel, high-compression version of the OHC six, marketed as an alternative to higher-priced European sport sedans, which had similar OHC engines. For those wanting V8 power, the 326 and 326 HO options continued with horsepower ratings of 250 and , respectively, and GTO engines stayed the same.

Only minor changes were made to the 1967 Tempest, Custom and Le Mans models. The GTO 389 V8 was replaced by a new 400 cu in V8. The Rochester four-barrel carburetor replaced both the standard GTO Carter AFB four-barrel and the Tri-Power carburetor option. The Turbo Hydromatic TH-400 replaced the previous Buick Super Turbine two speed automatic. The 326 cu in V8&#x27;s remained unchanged. The four-barrel OHC six was uprated to . Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player and hood-mounted tachometer. All 1967 Pontiacs got GM&#x27;s safety package, mandated by Federal law, which included a dual-circuit braking system, energy absorbing steering column, wheel, and interior, shoulder belt anchors, four-way hazard flashers, and a new directional signal control that could be &quot;flicked&quot; for lane changes.
==Third generation (1968–1970)==
A completely restyled Tempest was introduced for 1968 with streamlined Coke bottle styling, concealed windshield wipers, and a return to horizontal headlights. Two-door models rode on a wheelbase and four-door models on . The 230 cu in overhead cam sixes were enlarged to 250 cu in, with horsepower ratings unchanged while the 326 V8 was replaced by a new V8 with horsepower ratings of 250 with two-barrel or 320 with four-barrel carb. The same lineup of models including the base Tempest, Tempest Custom and Le Mans continued as in previous years.

Other than elimination of vent windows on hardtop coupes, styling only received minor revisions for 1969, when the Tempest Custom was renamed the Custom S for this one year. However, model offerings were the same as 1968. A new three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic transmission was introduced and available with all engines as an alternative to the older two-speed. Engine offerings were the same as before except for the 350 HO V8 engine gaining five-horsepower to 325. A new locking steering column with relocated ignition switch was introduced and front seat headrests became standard equipment. A new GTO option became available, The Judge. Featuring special decals, two Ram Air versions of Pontiac&#x27;s 400 engine, and a rear spoiler, The Judge was originally conceived as a barebones muscle car based on the Tempest to compete with the new sub-$3,000 Plymouth Roadrunner. Plans for the new model were terminated, and Pontiac division head John DeLorean opted to create a GTO variant instead.

Minor styling revisions, that included a new front grille treatment, highlighted the 1970 Tempest, which was the final year for the nameplate. Initially, the line was down to just two- and four-door sedans but expanded at mid-year with the introduction of the low-priced T-37 hardtop coupe, billed as GM&#x27;s lowest-priced hardtop coupe. The Custom S became the Le Mans this year and the previous Le Mans series was renamed the Le Mans Sport. The Pontiac-built OHC six-cylinder engine was replaced by a Chevy-built 250 in3 inline six while the 350 V8 was down to a two-barrel version. New engine offerings included 400 in³ V8s rated at with two-barrel carburetor and 8.6:1 compression ratio or 330 with four-barrel and 10.25:1 compression.

The Tempest nameplate was phased out after the 1970 model year. For 1971, it was replaced by a new T-37 series that included each of the three bodystyles offered on the 1970 Tempest and T-37. After this year, the T-37 was dropped. In 1972 all Pontiac intermediates took the Le Mans nameplate except the GTO.

===Tempest Custom S===

The Pontiac Tempest Custom S was a one-year only Pontiac nameplate offered during the 1969 model year car as a replacement for the &quot;Tempest Custom&quot; trim level in the Division&#x27;s line-up. Originally to be called the &quot;Pontiac TC&quot;, it was slotted between the Tempest and LeMans in price and features.

The Custom S was available in six different body designs: two-door convertible, hardtop coupe, sports coupe, a 4-door sedan, a 4-door hardtop, and a station wagon. The sports coupe can be differentiated from the hardtop by the presence of a vent window in the front door. Interior and exterior appointments fell between the Tempest and the LeMans and GTO.

The Custom S came standard with Pontiac&#x27;s unique overhead camshaft OHC-6 engine. Also available was a TQ OHC inline 6-cylinder with the &quot;Sprint&quot; package, a overhead valve pushrod V8 , and a version of the same engine with higher compression and a 4-barrel carburetor.
==Fourth generation (1987–1991)==

Pontiac marketed a rebadged version of the compact L-body Chevrolet Corsica as Tempest, for Canada, Israel and GCC only, beginning in model year 1987. The Tempest was built alongside the Corsica at the Wilmington Assembly plant in Wilmington, Delaware. Discontinued in 1991, the Tempest was replaced with the Grand Am sedan. The 1987-1991 Pontiac Tempest came in two trim levels, base (equivalent to the U.S. Corsica LT) and LE (equivalent to the U.S. Corsica LTZ) The main differences that separates the Tempest from its L-Body twin are different grille, emblems and taillights (the taillights were later adopted as the U.S. Corsica&#x27;s taillights). The only other differences were wheel options, DRLs and a metric instrument cluster. This model was also sold briefly in Israel; there are brochures showing Canadian-spec models from 1990/1991.

<text>WWE 2K, formerly released as WWF SmackDown!, WWE SmackDown!, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw, WWE, and Exciting Pro Wrestling in Japan, is a series of professional wrestling sports simulation video games that launched in 2000. The premise of the series is to emulate professional wrestling, specifically that of WWE, formerly known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The series began with &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; on the original PlayStation and has continued as an annual release (with the exception of 2021). It was originally exclusive to PlayStation platforms until 2006&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, which expanded the series to other platforms. In 2013, the series was rebranded as &quot;WWE 2K&quot;, beginning with &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;.

The games were originally published by THQ and developed by Yuke&#x27;s under the &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; name—in 2002, the WWF was renamed to WWE. Beginning with &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot; in 2004, the series changed its name to &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw&quot; and then simply &quot;WWE&quot; with 2011&#x27;s &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;. 2K, previously under the 2K Sports sub-label, took over as publisher following THQ&#x27;s bankruptcy beginning with 2013&#x27;s &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, changing the series to &quot;WWE 2K&quot;, and the series was co-developed with Visual Concepts until Yuke&#x27;s departure in 2018. Visual Concepts would take over lead development of the series beginning with &quot;WWE 2K20&quot; in 2019. Due to major technical issues with that installment, the main series took a two-year hiatus with a spin-off, &quot;WWE 2K Battlegrounds&quot;, released in 2020 before the next main installment, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, released in 2022.

== History and development ==

The first game, &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, was developed by Yuke&#x27;s, published by THQ, and released on March 2, 2000; this arrangement would continue until 2012. The series was originally named after one of WWE&#x27;s weekly television programs, &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and was initially exclusive to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2. The series engine was originally based on the one used by the Japanese &quot;Toukon Retsuden&quot;, which was also developed by Yuke&#x27;s.

The series rebranded with 2004&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;, following the introduction of the brand extension, which saw WWE&#x27;s roster divided between the SmackDown and Raw brands; the latter named after WWE&#x27;s two flagship programs, &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and Friday Night SmackDown. After using subtitles in previous installments, voice overs were introduced to the game&#x27;s &quot;Season Mode&quot;. With the exception of 2003&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;, pre-recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot; in 2001.

Yuke&#x27;s studios in Yokohama, Japan worked with WWE writers to create storylines for the &quot;Season&quot; modes of each game since 2005&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;. Up until the release of &quot;SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;, Yuke&#x27;s had released previous entries of the series in Japan under the title of &quot;Exciting Pro Wrestling&quot;. That year, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and rebranded the &quot;Exciting Pro Wrestling&quot; series under the licensed name.

2006&#x27;s &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot; was the first game in the series to be released for multiple game consoles. The series continued to expand to various seventh-generation consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices. Yuke&#x27;s revealed they had to port their original game codes that make up each game mode and graphic designs to a new game engine that supported the new consoles. When new features are added to future games, the developers had to create new gaming codes for these features. The developers also had to test the game for any errors. While there were no errors, the game received a lot of reports for overheating in the earlier releases.

The series relaunched in 2011 with the release of &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;. However, after THQ&#x27;s bankruptcy, liquidation, and eventual dissolution in January 2013, publishing rights for the WWE video games were acquired by Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two confirmed the acquisition in February, saying that it would also retain the services of Yuke&#x27;s and the THQ staff that worked on the &quot;WWE&quot; series.

2013&#x27;s &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; was the first game to be released under the 2K Sports branding. In 2015, a mobile-only spin-off was released for Android and iOS. 2K&#x27;s license of the series extended in early 2016. 2018&#x27;s &quot;WWE 2K19&quot; was the last game in the series to be developed by Yuke&#x27;s.

2019&#x27;s &quot;WWE 2K20&quot; was the first game in the series to be developed solely by Visual Concepts, who had worked with Yuke&#x27;s on previous games under the &quot;WWE 2K&quot; banner. The game received generally negative reviews for various changes seen as a regression from &quot;2K19&quot;, and for numerous bugs and technical issues upon its launch. The series went on a two-year hiatus in response, with &quot;WWE 2K Battlegrounds&quot; released in 2020 as a replacement for a previously planned &quot;WWE 2K21&quot; game. &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, the twenty-second installment of the series, was released in March 2022 to a generally more favourable reception than its predecessor. &quot;WWE 2K23&quot;, the twenty-third installment of the series, was released in March 2023 surpassing the expectations preceded by &quot;2K22&quot;.
==Gameplay==
The first game in the series, &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot;, had a clear cut system for moves such as combining an arrow key with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an arrow key with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot; to &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006&quot; used the aforementioned control scheme. With &quot;WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007&quot; new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called &quot;Ultimate Control moves&quot;. Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system&#x27;s controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, in order for players to force a character to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker towards the end of the meter labeled &quot;Submit&quot;, and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards &quot;Escape&quot;. Included with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot; was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system&#x27;s controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold.

Every game in the &quot;SmackDown vs. Raw&quot; series used to have the amount of damage inflicted to the player&#x27;s chosen character, measured with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a character, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more likely it is for the character to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage.

Included with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot; was the option of fighting &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;clean&quot;. When players select &quot;dirty&quot;, the player character is booed by the audience in the game; conversely, the &quot;clean&quot; character is cheered by the audience. With the &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;clean&quot; option comes the inclusion of performing a special maneuver when playing. Players using a &quot;dirty&quot; character must direct them into building up their &quot;dirty&quot; meter by performing &quot;dirty&quot; tactics, such as attacking the referee or taking the pad off the ring&#x27;s turnbuckle. Unlike performing dirty tactics, &quot;clean&quot; characters build their meters by performing &quot;clean&quot; tactics, such as an aerial technique or performing a taunt. When &quot;dirty&quot; character&#x27; meters build up, they are able to perform a signature low blow; likewise, &quot;clean&quot; characters can perform their signature move at double its normal damage.

With the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot; was the inclusion of a stamina system, which was a measure of the characters&#x27; stamina. The stamina system was measured by a meter on the HUD; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the character or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player&#x27;s system. When the character&#x27;s stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, they fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot; and was disabled until 2K took over the series, bringing in a similar system with &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;.

The weak/strong grapple system from the past games was removed from &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot; onwards. Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent&#x27;s current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game&#x27;s artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. &quot;Dynamic Comebacks&quot; gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New &quot;wake up taunts&quot; bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as pounding on the ground before RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a &quot;Breaking Point&quot; submission minigame.

===Story modes===
In the &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw&quot; series, the player was able to choose a character from a roster and compete in an arcade-like feature called season mode. In season mode, players direct their characters through different career obstacles through a year of WWE programming to gain respect by other wrestlers and popularity among the fans. Like storylines from WWE, the characters in the &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw&quot; series season mode are involved in storylines that affect their career mode in some way. Beginning with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, the WWE Brand Extension has been included in season mode, and characters are exclusive to one brand of WWE. A result of this feature is that the player&#x27;s character may only wrestle others and compete for championships from the same brand on which they are a part of. In season mode, the player&#x27;s character has the ability to earn and wrestle for a variety of championships based on actual WWE Championships. When characters win championships, their respect and popularity increase, which also increases their involvement in main event matches. As the character&#x27;s respect and popularity increases through the year of WWE programming, it becomes more likely for the player to achieve the main goal in season mode, which is to earn a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania, the WWE&#x27;s flagship pay-per-view event and the final stage in season mode. After the final stage, season modes begins again with the same character chosen before, though the player has the option of switching characters. They are then a part of the WWE Draft Lottery and assigned to a brand.

===Exhibition mode===

Other than the season mode, every game features an exhibition mode, where different professional wrestling match types are available. Basic matches included in every game are &quot;one-on-one&quot; matches, where a player chooses one character to wrestle another bot operated or human operated character, or tag team matches, where a pair of characters team together to face another team, Mixed Gender Tag Team matches have been removed in &quot;WWE 2K18&quot;. These basic matches may also expand into six-man tag team matches or non-elimination type matches, which include four or more characters. Besides basic matches, hardcore based matches are also included, such as the Steel Cage match, which has been included in every game, the Ladder match, the Elimination Chamber, which was first included with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;, and ECW Extreme Rules matches, which is basic hardcore wrestling based on the ECW brand of WWE (which first appeared with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;). Also included in every game is the Royal Rumble match, which is based on WWE&#x27;s actual Royal Rumble match, in which a player chooses to compete as one character, and must wrestle against twenty-nine other characters.

===Online gameplay===
Starting with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;, online gameplay was made available through PlayStation 2&#x27;s Sony Network Adapter. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a strip match, in which a player competes as any female wrestler in WWE and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot; was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot; on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot;), players were able to select music from their system&#x27;s hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in character&#x27; ring entrances.

===Roster===
Every game in the &quot;WWE&quot; series includes a roster of characters, &quot;superstars&quot; and &quot;divas&quot;, based on people who perform for WWE. Every year, WWE acquires new people and releases old ones. As a result, every time a &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw&quot; game is released, the new characters are added into the game and the old are removed from the game to reflect the changes in the actual WWE. From the release of &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; to the release of &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, characters were not divided into brands. In 2002, the WWE split its roster into two brands of wrestling, called Raw and SmackDown!, which were named after WWE&#x27;s television shows. The WWE Brand Extension was first featured in &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;. In 2006, WWE launched a new brand, called ECW, which was named after the original Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion. The new ECW brand was first featured in &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;. WWE holds an annual draft lottery, in which WWE characters switch brands. The games in production when the draft occurs include the changes that take place in the draft. For example, when &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot; was in production during June 2007, the 2007 WWE Draft took place, and the draft changes were included in the video game. Another brand of wrestling included in the series is the legends program, which was first included with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;. Popular WWE alumni or members of the WWE Hall of Fame have been included since then under the legends program. This was featured up until the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, as alumni and Hall of Fame members were not featured in &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot; due to production of &quot;WWE Legends of WrestleMania&quot;. &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009&quot; was also the first game to feature characters as downloadable content (DLC).

&quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot; has 56 wrestlers and 78 by DLC, &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot; with 84 and 107 by DLC, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; with 82 and 103 by DLC, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot; with 76 and 113 with DLC, &quot;WWE 2K (Mobile)&quot; with 19, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; with 133 including DLC giving this title &quot;the highest character roster in the video game&#x27;s history&quot; with 165. &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; carries 145 for the physical disc versions for PS3 and Xbox 360; 150 for the NXT Edition made for PS4 and Xbox One with DLC at 172. &quot;WWE 2K18&quot; contains 197 for the standard version (202 via Deluxe and Collector&#x27;s Edition) with DLC announced at a later date. An update on the &quot;WWE 2K18&quot; roster revealed on September 25, 2017, the final roster is 220 (197 on disc virtually reading 204 by attires counted). &quot;WWE 2K19&quot; has 217 characters on disc (224 via Woo Edition) and 236 with DLC counted as final. &quot;WWE 2K20&quot; has 217 characters on disc (221 via SmackDown 20th Anniversary Edition) with DLC yet to be finalized.

&quot;WWE 2K22&quot; has 173 in its base roster with the DLC pushing the expanded character list to 214.

&quot;WWE 2K23&quot; has 221 on the internal base roster with 25 others for DLC given an immense total of 246 (surpassing the 2k16 roster by double the portion) but 30 less than 2k20 which had 276 

===Create mode===
The series features a create-a-superstar mode, where players are able to create their own wrestler, including their move set and ring entrances. The feature was introduced when &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered; the first change came with the release of &quot;WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role&quot;, which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006&quot;, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for the created character. The feature was expanded with the release of &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects in any part of the character&#x27;s entrance.

==Reception==

The original &quot;WWF SmackDown!&quot; sold over 975,000 units for the PlayStation, and selling over one million copies in the United States. By 2003, the series had sold more than units for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 in the United States.

The series as a whole initially received generally positive reviews, however, overall reception would begin to decline in the late 2000s, as later games were criticized for their lack of innovations or improvements from previous installments.

<doc id="698178" wikidata="Q1194586" url="?curid=698178" title="Petco Park">
<text>Petco Park is a ballpark in San Diego, California. It is the home of the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB). The ballpark is located in the East Village neighborhood of downtown San Diego, adjacent to the Gaslamp Quarter. Petco Park opened in 2004, replacing San Diego Stadium as the Padres&#x27; home venue, where the team played from their inception in 1969 to 2003. 

On April 8, 2004, the Padres played their first game at the ballpark, defeating the San Francisco Giants 4–3 in 10 innings. Petco Park hosted the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic championship and the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. On October 9, 2024, Petco Park achieved an attendance record for baseball during a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with 47,773 people in attendance. 

Petco Park features unique design elements, particularly the Western Metal Supply Co. building, a historic warehouse incorporated into the ballpark; its southeast corner serves as the left field foul pole. Gallagher Square, located beyond the outfield wall, includes a community park and viewing terrace, among other features open to the public during stadium off-hours.

==History==
===Construction===
The ballpark was constructed by San Diego Ballpark Builders, a partnership with Clark Construction, ROEL Construction and Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc. The construction cost of more than $450 million was partially funded by a public–private partnership which included the Center City Development Corporation and the San Diego Redevelopment Agency. The stadium was intended to be part of a comprehensive plan to revitalize San Diego&#x27;s aging downtown, particularly the East Village area. The stadium is across Harbor Drive from the San Diego Convention Center, and its main entrance behind home plate is two blocks from the downtown terminal of the San Diego Trolley light rail system.

The ballpark was scheduled to open for the 2002 season; however, construction was suspended temporarily for legal and political reasons. Part of this was a court decision, which nullified an already passed ballot proposition approving the city&#x27;s portion of the stadium financing package and required the proposition be put to voters a second time. Construction encountered a further delay regarding the Western Metal Supply Co. building, which was a historic landmark. After negotiations with the preservation community, the builders agreed to rehabilitate the building in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior&#x27;s standards, and the building was renovated and included in the stadium design in an example of adaptive reuse.

The resulting delays required the Padres to play the 2002 and 2003 seasons at Qualcomm Stadium.

=== Location ===
The southern side of the stadium is bounded by San Diego Trolley light rail tracks along the north side of Harbor Drive, which serve the adjacent San Diego Convention Center. The portion of K Street between Seventh and 10th is closed to automobiles and serves as a pedestrian promenade along the back of the left and center field outfield seating and also provides access to Gallagher Square behind center field.

Two of the stadium&#x27;s outfield entrance areas are located at K Street&#x27;s intersections with Seventh and 10th avenues. The main entrance, behind home plate, is at the south end of Park Boulevard (at Imperial) and faces the San Diego Trolley station 12th &amp; Imperial Transit Center. The ballpark is also located approximately away from Santa Fe Depot station, which is served by Amtrak and Coaster.

===Naming rights===
San Diego–based pet supplies retailer Petco originally bought naming rights to the stadium in 2004 for $60 million in a 22-year deal. In 2021, Petco signed a new deal with the Padres that ensured the stadium would be named Petco Park through at least 2027. This extension also helped start some other initiatives for Petco and the stadium. Petco’s new logo has appeared on new digital signage throughout the park. Following the deal, Petco has also entered a strategic partnership with Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr. to promote the wellbeing of pets and their parents. Petco will also be collaborating with players on social and other digital media to promote pet health.

===Baseball milestones===
The first baseball game was played at Petco Park on March 11, 2004. It was part of a four-team NCAA invitational tournament hosted by San Diego State University. The San Diego State Aztecs baseball team, of which retired Padres player Tony Gwynn was the head coach, defeated Houston. It remains the largest attended game in college baseball history. Lance Zawadzki recorded the first hit, when he hit a double. Rielly Embrey hit the first home run in the 5th inning of the same game. On April 8, 2004, the Padres played their first regular season game at Petco Park and defeated the San Francisco Giants 4–3 in 10 innings. On April 15, 2004, Mark Loretta hit the first Padre home run off of Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers. It was caught by Mike Hill, a bartender at the Kansas City Barbecue.

The stadium&#x27;s first playoff game was played on October 8, 2005. The St. Louis Cardinals beat the Padres, 7–4, to finish off the three-game sweep of the 2005 NLDS.

On March 18 and 20, 2006, the ballpark hosted the semifinals and finals of the first World Baseball Classic. It also hosted second-round games of the 2009 World Baseball Classic. On April 4, 2006, Petco Park had its first rainout, postponing a Padres evening game against the San Francisco Giants.

On August 4, 2007, Barry Bonds hit his 755th home run to tie Hank Aaron&#x27;s record.

On April 17, 2008, the Padres and Rockies played in a 22-inning game. It was the longest MLB game in nearly 15 years. The game lasted for 22 innings and went on for 6 hours and 16 minutes, ending at 1:21 am in a 2-1 win for the Colorado Rockies. The game featured a stretch of 13 scoreless innings. As of 2023, this remains the longest game in Petco Park’s history. 

On July 2, 2009, the park was the site of the first MLB game delayed by a swarm of bees. In a game between the Padres and the Houston Astros, a small swarm of honeybees took up residence around a chair in left field, causing the game to be delayed by 52 minutes. A beekeeper was called in and the swarm was exterminated. The Astros won that game, 7–2.

On June 14, 2010, during a Toronto Blue Jays vs. San Diego Padres game, there was a magnitude-5.7 earthquake, which was centered about east of San Diego. Play stopped momentarily in the eighth inning. The Blue Jays went on to win 6–3.

Rain delays led to the suspension of the Padres&#x27; game with the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 8, 2011. The first delay caused the game to start 28 minutes late. Play then was stopped for more than 90 minutes in the second inning and again in the sixth inning for more than hour. The score was tied at 2–2 in the top of the ninth inning when play was suspended at 1:40 a.m. PDT April 9. After a fourth rain delay, the game was finished April 9, with the Dodgers winning in 11 innings, 4–2.

On April 30, 2012, Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun became the first player to hit three home runs in one game at the park. Braun finished the game 4–5 with three home runs and a triple.

On July 13, 2013, Tim Lincecum threw the park&#x27;s first no-hitter for the visiting San Francisco Giants as they defeated the Padres, 9–0.

The park hosted the 2016 MLB All-Star Game.

In 2017, Petco Park played host to Pool F of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, in which host USA and undefeated Puerto Rico advanced to the semi-finals. 

For the 2020 MLB postseason, the park was one of two stadiums (along with Dodger Stadium) to host neutral-site games of the ALDS, and was also the only stadium to host neutral-site games of the ALCS.

Eduardo Escobar of the New York Mets was the first player to hit for the cycle in the history of Petco Park on June 6, 2022. Later that year, the Padres made it to the postseason as the 5th wild card seed with a 89–73 record. Petco Park hosted its very first postseason game featuring the Padres with fans in attendance in 16 years, as they squared off against the 111-win division rival Los Angeles Dodgers in game 3 of the NLDS. The San Diego Padres would go on to win the series 3-1. On October 18, 2022, Kyle Schwarber of the Philadelphia Phillies hit the longest home run ever recorded at Petco Park at 488 feet in game one of the NLCS.

On May 11, 2024, Petco Park achieved an attendance record for baseball during a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers; the team cited 46,701 people in attendance. The record was beaten shortly after on July 5, in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, with 47,171 people in attendance. The record was beaten once again on July 30 against the Los Angeles Dodgers with a walk-off win in front of a crowd of 47,559.

==Media==

Petco Park can be seen and can even be entered in the video game &quot;Midnight Club 3&quot; in the city of San Diego.

Petco Park and Fenway Park were visibly fused together to create &quot;Greenway Park&quot; in &quot;Call of Duty Ghosts&quot;.

===PETA protest===
During stadium construction, the Padres offered fans the chance to purchase bricks outside of the concourse and to dedicate them. PETA tried to purchase a brick to protest Petco&#x27;s treatment of animals (PETA and Petco have a long-standing dispute over this matter), but the first two attempts were denied. Undeterred, PETA succeeded on its third attempt by purchasing a brick, which read &quot;Break Open Your Cold Ones Toast The Padres Enjoy This Champion Organization.&quot; When one reads the first letter of each word, it forms an acrostic which reads &quot;BOYCOTT PETCO.&quot; The Padres decided to leave the brick, saying not enough people walking by would notice the secret meaning.

==Features and design==

Petco Park differentiates itself from many other Major League ballparks built in the same era by eschewing &quot;retro-style&quot; red brick and green seats. The stadium is clad in Indian sandstone and stucco; its exposed steel is painted white and the 39,860 fixed seats are dark blue. The design is meant to evoke the sandy color of San Diego cliffs and beaches, the blue of the ocean, and the white sails of boats on the nearby San Diego Bay.

Architects Populous (née HOK Sport) and Antoine Predock&#x27;s design pulled restaurants, administrative offices and other amenities away from the seating bowl itself into other buildings surrounding the bowl. As a result, the ballpark&#x27;s concourses are open not only to the playing field but also to the surrounding city. Unlike many outdoor ballparks, in which the batter faces northeast, at Petco the batter faces due north, and fans in the grandstands are treated to a view of San Diego Bay and the San Diego skyline beyond the left field seats, as well as a view of Balboa Park, which contains the San Diego Zoo, beyond center field. &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; honored the ballpark in 2006 with an Orchid award for its design.

Petco Park&#x27;s official address is 19 Tony Gwynn Way, in honor of the eight-time National League batting champion who wore that uniform number during his major league career. A statue of Gwynn was unveiled July 21, 2007, on the stadium grounds. On August 18, 2018, a statue of National League Saves Leader and longtime Padre Trevor Hoffman was unveiled along K Street behind the bullpen, facing Gwynn&#x27;s statue.

Gallagher Square, a grassy berm sloping above the outfield fence, is open during games, allowing fans to sit and watch games. When no games are being played, Gallagher Square serves as a free local park for area residents. An unusual feature Petco Park once had was that the home team bullpen was located behind the center field wall while the bullpen for the visiting team was in foul territory in right field. However, both bullpens were moved behind the center field wall after modifications to the ballpark were made prior to the start of the 2013 season. For the 2012 season, Gallagher Square also played host to a semi-permanent stage used by the Padres&#x27; new broadcaster, at the time known as Fox Sports San Diego, for pre-game and post-game programming.

The left-field HD videoboard, manufactured by Daktronics, was installed in 2015. Measuring tall by wide, the new videoboard is nearly five times the size of the previous board and was, as of 2016, Major League Baseball&#x27;s fifth-largest (behind Cleveland, Seattle, Kansas City, and Atlanta) and the National League&#x27;s second-largest (edging out Philadelphia). The Padres can show full-screen live game action, video replays, or fan prompts or split the screen into sections for statistical information, graphics, and animations.

In addition to the left-field display, the Padres installed LED ribbon boards stretching nearly along the first- and third-base lines on the Toyota Terrace level, as well as of ribbon boards on the left-field grandstand.

The Padres also added eight mini scoreboards located under overhangs in the seating bowl on the field level, along with new 60-in. Sony TVs in the same areas, to give fans seated in the back of those sections better views.

To support the new HD videoboards, the Padres partnered with Sony and Diversified Systems on an HD control room. Located on the press level on the third-base side, the control room houses a Sony MVS8000x switcher, ChyronHego graphics servers, Click Effects CrossFire servers, and Evertz router, DreamCatcher replay servers, and terminal gear. The team will deploy a complement of Sony HSC300 cameras and two wireless roving cameras while it considers additional models for 4K acquisition.
The Western Metal Supply Co. building, a hundred-year-old brick structure that had been scheduled for demolition to make way for Petco Park, was saved and incorporated into the design of the ballpark. The building was renovated and contains the team store, private suites, a restaurant and rooftop seating. The southeast corner of the building serves as the left field foul pole, and is protected by a strip of bright yellow angle iron.

Fans in concession stands, in bars, restaurants or wandering the stands can watch the action on 244 HDTV monitors and an additional 500 SDTVs. More than 500 computer-controlled speakers throughout the park deliver the sound as a &quot;distributed signal&quot;, eliminating the audio delay from a central bank of speakers, such as the system at Qualcomm Stadium. Four stationary cameras, one roving camera and use of six Cox-TV cameras provide videos for the park&#x27;s screens.

Every time the Padres hit a home run or win the game, a ship&#x27;s whistle is sounded and fireworks are shot off in center field. Beginning with the 2011 season, four torches were added to the center field wall that light up when the Padres hit a home run or win the game. The ship&#x27;s whistle is a recording of the whistle of the Navy&#x27;s , a nuclear aircraft carrier that was ported in San Diego.

There are a total of 5,000 club seats and 70 luxury suites at the ballpark.

===Modifications===
Petco Park has been described as being an &quot;extreme pitcher&#x27;s park&quot;. During the 2005–06 offseason, Padres CEO Sandy Alderson adjusted the dimensions in right-center field in an attempt to make it more hitter friendly. At the end of the 2008 season, Petco Park ranked 29th in hits and 30th out of 30 in home runs per Major League ballpark.

Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, the Padres announced that they were moving the fences in to make this ballpark more favorable to hitters than it had been previously. The left-center field wall was moved in from to , the right-center field wall was moved from to , and the right field wall was moved in from to . In addition, the visiting team bullpen was moved from foul territory in right field to behind the left-center field wall, right behind where the Padres bullpen is. The right field wall was also lowered from to , and the out-of-town scoreboard was relocated.

After the conclusion of the 2014 season, more renovations to the park commenced. These include a new HD video board, slight changes to the distance to the left-field fence, and removal of some seats in the middle deck (which were replaced with standing-room seating). The alterations, including the new video board, were completed by Opening Day 2015.

<text>Sonoma State University (SSU, Sonoma State, or Sonoma) is a public university in Sonoma County, California, United States. It is part of the California State University system. Sonoma State offers 92 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 19 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 11 teaching credentials. The university is a Hispanic-serving institution.

==History==

===Founding===
Sonoma State College was established by the California State Legislature in 1960 to be part of the California State College system, with significant involvement of the faculty from San Francisco State University. As with all California State Colleges, Sonoma State later became part of the California State University system. Sonoma opened for the first time in 1961, with an initial enrollment of 250 students. Classes offered took place in leased buildings in Rohnert Park where the college offered its first four-year Bachelor of Arts degree in Elementary Education. The small first graduating class received their degrees in the parking lot of the temporary campus. With the completion of its two main classroom halls, Stevenson Hall, named for politician Adlai Stevenson II, and Darwin Hall, named for Charles Darwin, the college moved to its permanent campus in 1966 where the graduating class became the first to receive their degrees at the new campus.

===Early development===

As enrollment increased, Sonoma State built more on-campus facilities, including Ives Hall for performing arts, The University Commons for dining, a small library, and a gymnasium. These buildings followed the physical master plan of the school which stated that the facilities would be urban in character, defining the use of smooth concrete building façades with landscaped courtyards. Among the landscaping features added with these facilities were the &quot;Campus Lakes&quot;, two small reservoirs located behind the Commons next to Commencement Lawn, the site of the university&#x27;s annual commencement ceremonies, as well as one lake near a housing facility, Beaujolais Village; the lakes are home to local waterfowl.
In 1969, the first master&#x27;s degrees in biology and psychology were offered. The new cluster school concept, coupled with a more intense focus on the surrounding rural environment, influenced the new physical master plan. The first facility built under the new plan was the Zinfandel residence area. The new Student Health Center used a primarily redwood façade with a landscaped ground cover of wild roses and poppies. Sonoma State was closed from May 7–11, 1970, after Governor Ronald Reagan ordered that all California colleges and universities shut down due to anti-war protests and rallies after the shootings of four students at Kent State University.

Early development of the modern campus came to a close in 1976 when the Student Union was constructed between the main quad and the lakes. This building continued the use of the physical master plan, using primarily redwood and preceded the similarly built Carson Hall, an art building, a childcare center, additional parking, and a computer center which was added onto the library.

===Modern university===
In 1978, Sonoma State College became Sonoma State University when the school officially gained university status, after which the surrounding community provided funds for the new university to build a large swimming pool, completed in 1982, and the 500-seat Evert Person Theatre in 1989. Further enrollment increases and a new goal of movement toward a residential campus as opposed to a commuter campus facilitated the building of Verdot Village in 1995.

===21st-century expansion===

In May 2001, the board of trustees approved a new master plan, which added to the campus, located north of Copeland Creek. Rapidly accelerated growth of the residential student body was alleviated by the construction of the third phase of on-campus housing named Sauvignon Village, offering housing to non-freshman students. In the same year, the Jean and Charles Schulz Information Center was completed to accommodate the expanded needs of the library and computing services. The facility was built as a prototype library and information complex for the 21st century, housing more than 400,000 volumes in its stacks. The center also houses an advanced Automated Retrieval System (ARS) which contains an additional 750,000 volumes in a computer-managed shelving system in the library wing. A large portion of the funding to build the information center was donated by Charles Schulz, cartoonist and author of the popular Peanuts comic series, and his wife Jean.
In January 2005, the university began the renovation of Darwin Hall, the university&#x27;s science building, which had been built in 1967. The new building was designed to provide efficient academic classrooms and study areas for faculty and their students. The renovated structure was completed and re-opened in fall 2006 and provided new laboratories and classrooms to support the needs of a modern science curriculum.

The new property approved by the board of trustees in 2000 is also the site of the Donald and Maureen Green Music Center, funded by private donors. A component of the Green Music Center, Music Education Hall, was state-funded. The center contains the 1,400-seat Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall, which was completed in 2012. Its resident orchestra is the Santa Rosa Symphony.

In May 2007, SSU faculty voted no confidence in President Armiñana based upon financial issues surrounding the building of the Green Music Center and faculty allegations that the building of the center took money away from academic programs. The center, originally intended to be a US$10 million project, grew into a $120 million complex as additional venues and features were added to the original plan. The construction of the center was initially funded by bond measures, loans, and private donations as the use of academic funds for other uses is illegal. The board of trustees continued to support Armiñana despite the vote.

In February 2010, the FBI and investigators from the Sonoma County District Attorney&#x27;s offices raided the campus&#x27;s administrative and finance offices seizing dozens of boxes from a storage area, and examined computers. The operation focused on an alleged misuse of federal grant money by the California Institute for Human Services (CIHS), a unit closed by SSU in 2007. The two top CIHS administrators were dismissed at that time.

A new social center for the university gained approval in April 2011. Students voted to raise their fees by $150 a semester to cover the cost of the $65 million facility.

In early 2025, after several years of declining enrollment and increasing costs, the university&#x27;s leaders announced that the university was facing a $24 million deficit. To address the deficit, they announced plans to eliminate numerous positions on campus and let go employees, including 46 tenured and adjunct faculty members. They also plan to eliminate about two dozen academic programs and six academic departments.

===Presidents===
The Office of the President began with the university&#x27;s founding in 1960 when Ambrose R. Nichols, Jr. became the founding president of the university. there have been eight presidents of Sonoma State University. In May 2023, the California State University Board of Trustees appointed Ming-Tung &quot;Mike&quot; Lee as Sonoma State&#x27;s newest permanent president. In May 2024, Lee was placed on administrative leave, following an unauthorized agreement he had made with campus protestors, and he retired the next day. Nathan Evans was named acting president while a search for a new president began.

== Campus ==

Sonoma State occupies approximately on the east side of the main suburban area of Rohnert Park. Directly adjacent to the main campus is Wolf&#x27;s Den Plaza, a frequent hangout and eating area for SSU students. As of fall 2018 Sonoma State had the third-largest white enrollment percentage of Americans in the California State University system.

===University library===
The three-story, library is separated into two wings housing different areas on each floor. The building has a total of of indoor floor space and of shelving. The library houses a collection of writings and original letters from Jack London, as well as memorabilia relating to his works. The $41.5 million building is named after Charles M. Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts comic cartoon, and his wife Jean, who donated $5 million to help build and furnish the structure.

=== Campus bookstore ===
The Sonoma State Bookstore was operated by Sonoma State Enterprises, Inc. until the spring of 2006 when the operation was outsourced to Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers, despite some opposition from faculty members.

=== Off-campus sites ===
In addition to the main campus, the university also owns and operates two off–campus study sites for students of the natural sciences. The first site is the Fairfield Osborn Preserve, located on nearby Sonoma Mountain. The second site is the Galbreath Wildlands Preserve in Mendocino County. Both offer opportunities for research and hands-on education to students of the university. Sonoma State also offers students the opportunity to obtain their bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal arts partly through classes offered at Napa Valley College and the Vallejo Satellite Campus of Solano Community College.

== Green Music Center ==
Music Education Hall (one of four components of the Green Music Center) opened its doors in 2008 to students taking classes in the two 60-person classrooms. The focal point of the Green Music Center is a 1,400-seat concert hall featuring precision engineered acoustics, named the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Hall. The entire rear wall of the hall opens to lawn seating for a total of 4,000 additional guests. The Hospitality Center, which includes a restaurant/executive conference center, opened in 2010. A $12 million donation from Joan and Sandy Weill, announced in March 2011, provided the funds to complete the concert hall for the fall 2012 opening. The 250-seat Schroeder Recital Hall opened in 2014.

== Academics ==
Sonoma State offers 46 majors and 49 minors at the undergraduate level as of 2017.

<text>P. L. Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems () of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The institute was founded in 1934. The founder of the institute, Nobel laureate Pyotr Kapitsa served as its head for many years. The head of the theoretical division of the institute was Lev Landau. The primary direction of research at the institute is low temperature physics, such as superconductivity and superfluidity. The theoretical division later became the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics.

<text>Eugenio María de Hostos y de Bonilla (January 11, 1839 – August 11, 1903), known as (&quot;The Great Citizen of the Americas&quot;), was a Puerto Rican educator, philosopher, intellectual, lawyer, sociologist, novelist, and Puerto Rican independence advocate.

==Early years and family==
Eugenio María de Hostos y de Bonilla was born into a well-to-do family in Barrio Río Cañas of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, on January 11, 1839. His parents were Eugenio María de Hostos y Rodríguez (1807–1897) and María Hilaria de Bonilla y Cintrón (died 1862, Madrid, Spain), both of Spanish descent.

At a young age, his family sent him to study in the capital of the island, San Juan, where he received his elementary education in the Liceo de San Juan. In 1852, his family sent him to Bilbao, Spain, where he graduated from the Institute of Secondary Education (high school). After he graduated, he enrolled at the Complutense University of Madrid in 1857. He studied law, philosophy and letters. As a student there, he became interested in politics. In 1863, he published in Madrid what is considered his greatest work, &quot;La Peregrinación de Bayoán&quot;. When Spain adopted its new constitution in 1869 and refused to grant Puerto Rico its independence, Hostos left Spain for the United States.

==Independence advocate==
During his one-year stay in the United States, he joined the Cuban Revolutionary Committee and became the editor of a journal called &quot;La Revolución&quot;. Hostos believed in the creation of an Antillian Confederation (Confederación Antillana) between Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. This idea was embraced by fellow Puerto Ricans Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. One of the things which disappointed Hostos was that in Puerto Rico and in Cuba there were many people who wanted their independence from Spain, but did not embrace the idea of becoming revolutionaries, preferring to be annexed by the United States.

Hostos wanted to promote the independence of Puerto Rico and Cuba and the idea of an Antillean Confederation, and he therefore traveled to many countries. Among the countries he went promoting his idea were the United States, France, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and the Danish colony of St. Thomas, which is now part of the United States Virgin Islands.

==Educator==
He spent one year in Lima, Peru, from November 1870 to December 1871, during which he helped develop the country&#x27;s educational system and spoke against the harsh treatment given to the Chinese who lived there. He then moved to Chile for two years. During his stay there, he taught at the University of Chile and gave a speech titled &quot;The Scientific Education of Women&quot;. He proposed in his speech that governments permit women in their colleges. Soon after, Chile allowed women to enter its college educational system. On September 29, 1873, he went to Argentina, where he proposed a railroad system between Argentina and Chile. His proposal was accepted and the first locomotive was named after him.

In 1875, Hostos went to Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, briefly visiting Santo Domingo. He conceived the idea of a Normal School (Teachers College) and introduced advanced teaching methods, although these had been openly opposed by the local Catholic Church as Hostos opposed any sort of religious instruction in the educational process. Nonetheless, his response to this criticism was calm and constructive, as many of his writings reveal. In April 1876, Hostos returned to New York and in November he traveled to Caracas, Venezuela, where he married Belinda Otilia de Ayala Quintana (1862–1917), from Cuba, on July 9, 1877. The couple had five children: Carlos Eugenio (b. 1879), Luisa Amelia (b. 1881), Bayoán Lautaro (b. 1885), Filipo Luis Duarte de Hostos (b. 1890) and María Angelina (b. 1892). Their wedding was officiated by the Archbishop of Caracas, José Antonio Ponte, and their maid of honor was the Puerto Rican poet, abolitionist, women&#x27;s rights activist and Puerto Rican independence advocate Lola Rodríguez de Tió. He returned to the Dominican Republic in 1879 and in February 1880 the first Normal School was inaugurated. He was named director and he helped establish a second Normal School in the city of Santiago de los Caballeros.

Hostos and his family returned to Chile in 1889. He directed the &quot;Liceos&quot; of Chillán (1889–90) and Santiago de Chile (1890–98) and taught law at the University of Chile.

==Later years and death==
Hostos returned to the United States in 1898 before relocating with his family to Santo Domingo in January 1900. In his last years, Hostos actively participated in the Puerto Rican and Cuban independence movements; his hopes for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence after the Spanish–American War turned into disappointment when the United States government rejected his proposals and instead converted the island into a United States colony.

In the Dominican Republic, Hostos continued to play a major role in reorganizing the educational and railroad systems. He wrote many essays on social science topics, such as psychology, logic, literature and law, and is considered one of the first systematic sociologists in Latin America. He was also known to be a supporter of women&#x27;s rights.

On August 11, 1903, Hostos died in Santo Domingo, aged 64. He is buried in the National Pantheon located in the colonial district of that city. Per his final wishes, his remains are to stay permanently in the Dominican Republic until the day Puerto Rico is completely independent. Then and only then, does he want to be reinterred in his homeland. Hostos wrote his own epitaph:

==Honors and recognitions==


* In 1938, the 8th International Conference of America, celebrated in Lima, Peru, posthumously paid tribute to Hostos and declared him &quot;Citizen of the Americas and Teacher of the Youth&quot;. Puerto Rico declared his birthday an official holiday, , celebrated on the second Monday of January. There is a monument honoring Hostos in Spain.
* A municipality was named after him in the Dominican Republic in Duarte Province.

===Monuments===
In Puerto Rico there are multiple monuments dedicated to Hostos:
* One sculpture created by Tomás Batista was located in a small plaza at the side of Highway #2 at the northern entrance to his native city of Mayagüez. It has since been relocated in front of the entrance to the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus;
* Another one created by José Buscaglia Guillermety. Recently, located inside the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus in San Juan.

==Ancestry==
The Ostos family name originated in Écija, Seville, as early as 1437. Eugenio de Ostos y del Valle was born in Écija around the year 1700 and later moved to Camagüey, Cuba, where he married María Josefa del Castillo y Aranda in 1735. Their son Juan José de Ostos y del Castillo was born in Camagüey in 1750 and moved to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Sometime after France seized control of the entire island of Hispaniola in 1795, Juan José changed the spelling of his surname to Hostos. This spelling was inherited by all his descendants. After the Haitian invasion of Santo Domingo in December 1800, Juan José relocated to Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, where he married María Altagracia Rodríguez Velasco (born in 1785 in Santo Domingo) in 1806. This was his second marriage, following the death of his first wife, María Blanco. Before his death in 1816, Juan José had four children with María, the second of which was Eugenio de Hostos y Rodríguez, born in 1807, who later became Secretary to Isabella II of Spain. Eugenio married María Hilaria de Bonilla y Cintrón in Mayagüez in 1831. Their sixth child (out of seven) was named after both parents: Eugenio María de Hostos y de Bonilla.

<text>The Courier-Mail is an Australian newspaper published in Brisbane. Owned by News Corp Australia, it is published daily from Monday to Saturday in tabloid format. Its editorial offices are located at Bowen Hills, in Brisbane&#x27;s inner northern suburbs, and it is printed at Yandina on the Sunshine Coast. It is available for purchase both online and in paper form throughout Queensland and most regions of Northern New South Wales.

==History==
===19th century origins===
The history of &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; is through four mastheads. The &quot;Moreton Bay Courier&quot; later became &quot;The Courier&quot;, then the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; and, since a merger with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 1933, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;.

The &quot;Moreton Bay Courier&quot; was established as a weekly paper in June 1846. Its first editorial promised to &quot;make known the wants of the community ... to rouse the apathetic, to inform the ignorant ... to transmit truthful representations of the state of this unrivalled portion of the colony to other and distant parts of the globe; to encourage every enterprise that will tend to benefit it, and in general to advance its interests, and promote its prosperity&quot;.

Issue frequency increased steadily to bi-weekly in January 1858, tri-weekly in December 1859, then daily under the editorship of Theophilus Parsons Pugh from 14 May 1861. The recognised founder and first editor was Arthur Sidney Lyon (1817–1861) who was assisted by its printer, James Swan (1811–1891), the later mayor of Brisbane and member of Queensland Legislative Council. Lyon, also referred to as the &quot;father of the Press&quot; in the colony of Queensland, had previously served as a writer and journalist in Melbourne, and later moved on to found and edit journals such as &quot;Moreton Bay Free Press&quot;, &quot;North Australian&quot; and &quot;Darling Downs Gazette&quot;. Lyon was encouraged to emigrate by John Dunmore Lang and arrived in Brisbane from Sydney in early 1846 to establish a newspaper. He persuaded James Swan, a printer of Lang&#x27;s Sydney newspaper &quot;The Colonialist&quot; to join him. Lyon and Swan established themselves on the corner of Queen Street and Albert Street, Brisbane, in a garret of a building later known as the North Star Hotel. The first issue of the &quot;Moreton Bay Courier&quot;, consisting of 4 pages, appeared weekly on Saturday 20 June 1846, with Lyon as editor and Swan as publisher.

After some 18 months, Lyon and Swan disagreed on many aspects of editorial policy, including transportation of convicts and squatting. Lyon took over sole control in late 1847, but had money problems, and gave sole control to Swan. Swan sold out to Thomas Blacket Stephens in about November 1859.&quot;The Moreton Bay Courier&quot; became &quot;The Courier&quot;, and then the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; in 1864. In June–July 1868, Stephens floated a new company, and transferred the plant and copyright of the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; to &quot;The Brisbane Newspaper Company&quot;. He was the managing director until retired in November 1873, when the paper was auctioned.

The journal was, from November 1873 to December 1880, managed by one of the new part-owners, the Tasmanian-born former public servant Gresley Lukin (1840–1916). Although called &quot;managing editor&quot;, actual writing and editing was by William Augustine O&#x27;Carroll (1831–1885). Most prominent of the various editors and sub-editors of &quot;The Queenslander&quot; literary staff were William Henry Traill (1842–1902), later NSW politician and editor of the famed Sydney journal &#x27;The Bulletin&#x27;, and Carl Adolph Feilberg (1844–1887). Feilberg followed William Henry Trail in the role of political commentator and the de facto editor of &quot;The Queenslander&quot; until January 1881. He succeeded William O&#x27;Carroll as &quot;Courier&quot; editor-in-chief from September 1883 to his death in October 1887. Lukin&#x27;s roles as part owner-editor changed on 21 December 1880. Charles Hardie Buzacott, former Postmaster General in the first McIlwraith government, had been a staff journalist.

===20th century===
John James Knight was editor-in-chief of &quot;The Brisbane Courier&quot; from 1906 to 1916, later managing director, then chairman of all of the company&#x27;s publications.

The first edition of &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; was published on 28 August 1933, after Keith Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;Herald and Weekly Times&quot; acquired and merged &quot;The Brisbane Courier&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (first published on 3 October 1903). In 1987, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Limited acquired newspaper control, and outstanding shares of Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd.

The Courier-Mail launched its first website in 1998.
===21st century===
From its inception until March 2006 &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; was a broadsheet newspaper. On 14 December 2005 it was announced that the paper would change to a tabloid sometime in early 2006, however the term &quot;tabloid&quot; was not used in favour of the term &quot;compact&quot;. This linguistic choice was probably related to widespread public view that many tabloids, including those published by News Limited, were low quality publications. The last broadsheet edition was published on Saturday 11 March 2006, and the first tabloid edition was published on Monday 13 March 2006. On the same day, the paper&#x27;s website was revamped and expanded.

The change to a tabloid format brought &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; in line with all other News Limited Australian metropolitan daily newspapers. It followed the change to a tabloid format by &quot;The Advertiser&quot; of Adelaide—another News Corporation newspaper—some years earlier.

==Recognition==
&quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; has twice been named news destination of the year by the Pacific Area Publishers Association and once the national/metro daily newspaper of the year.

It has a proud history of advocating for its community, and in 2022 was recognised by Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick as being the catalyst for an extra $425m in funding every year for mental health services.

&quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Political position==
Like other News Corp Australia newspaper, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; holds generally conservative political positions. Before 2010 News Corp Australia media was more politically flexible, but have become much more rigid as Lachlan Murdoch&#x27;s influence at the company has grown - , &quot;The Australian&quot; has endorsed the Liberal Party at each of the past five federal elections, while none of the four daily metros, including the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, have endorsed Labor since at least 2010.

In 2007, Crikey described it as &quot;...to the right, as the sleepier Murdoch tabloids always are – but it&#x27;s more lazy populism than ideological fervour&quot;.

===Endoresments===
==Criticism and legal issues==
&quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; has been described by Crikey as &quot;one of the contestants in a close run field for worst paper in Australia... mostly predictable and dull, with occasional honourable exceptions...&quot;.

In August 2011, police and the parents of a murder victim criticised the paper for falsely accusing their son of a child sex crime.

On 24 March 2014 Queensland Newspapers, the News Corp Australia subsidiary responsible for publishing the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;, was found guilty by a District Court of breaching restrictions on publishing Family Court proceedings on four occasions, and fined a total of $120,000. The breaches occurred in 2012 when the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; published on its front page the names and photos of a mother and her children involved in a Family Court dispute. District Court Justice Terence Martin said: &quot;It seems to me that the newspaper seized upon what it regarded as a sensational story, which would be attractive to readers, and put the story ahead of its legal obligations&quot;.

On 7 October 2014, the paper published a transphobic headline related to the gruesome murder of Mayang Prasetyo.

The paper raised controversy for depicting Indonesian president Joko Widodo with a doctored photo of bloody hands to protest against the country&#x27;s decision to execute two Australian convicted drug smugglers known as part of the Bali Nine in 2015.

==Circulation and readership==
In 2013, &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; had the fourth-highest circulation of any daily newspaper in Australia. Its average Monday-Friday net paid print sales were 172,801 between January and March 2013, having fallen 8.0 per cent compared to the previous year. Its average Saturday net paid print sales were 228,650 between January and March 2013, down 10.5 per cent compared to the previous year. The paper&#x27;s Monday-Friday readership was 488,000 in March 2013, having fallen 11.6 per cent compared to the previous year. Its Saturday readership was 616,000 in March 2013, down 13.8 per cent compared to the previous year. Around three-quarters of the paper&#x27;s readership is located in the Brisbane metropolitan area.

Although often claimed to be Brisbane&#x27;s only daily newspaper since the demise of Queensland Newspapers&#x27; own afternoon newspaper &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 1988, it arguably has had two competitors since 2007. News Corp itself published &quot;mX&quot;, a free afternoon newspaper, from 2007, but &quot;mX&quot; had a relatively low news content, and was discontinued in mid-2015. Fairfax Media has published the online only &quot;Brisbane Times&quot; since 2007.

, according to third-party web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb, &quot;Courier-Mail&quot;&#x27;s website was the 141st and 273rd most visited in Australia respectively. At the same time, SimilarWeb rated the site as the 25th most visited news website in Australia, attracting almost 2.6 million visitors per month.

==Awards sponsorship==
&quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; has co-sponsored two sets of literary awards.

The Courier-Mail Book of the Year Award, co-sponsored by Queensland Government and worth , was established in 1999, and covered a range of writing genres. The inaugural prize was awarded in 2001, and the last one in 2005. The winners of this award were:

*2005: &quot;The Silver Donkey: A Novel for Children&quot;, by Sonya Hartnett

From 2012 and , The Courier-Mail People&#x27;s Choice Queensland Book of the Year has been awarded as part of the Queensland Literary Awards. Again co-sponsored by &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; and the Queensland Government, this prize is awarded &quot;to an outstanding book by a Queensland author, taken from eligible books entered in the Fiction and Non-Fiction categories&quot;.

== Digitisation ==
Pre-1955 issues of the newspaper have been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program of the National Library of Australia.

==Editors and journalists==
For thirty years, the paper&#x27;s senior rugby league football journalist was former Australian vice-captain Jack Reardon. Sports editor at &quot;The Courier Mail&quot;, Tom Linneth, became the youngest editor in Australia in 1960 at the age of 29. He worked at &quot;The Courier Mail&quot; between about 1948 to 1974 and again worked there as the sports editor between about 1982 until he retired in 1996.

Chris Jones was appointed editor from 2020, replacing Sam Weir. Jones had worked for News Corp for 21 years.

<text>Stephanie Marie Herseth Sandlin (born December 3, 1970) is an American attorney, university administrator, and politician from the Democratic Party. She represented in the United States House of Representatives from 2004 until 2011. Sandlin was first elected to Congress in a July 2004 special election and won three full terms before losing to Republican Kristi Noem in 2010. She was the youngest female member of the House, and the first woman elected to the House from South Dakota. Before her 2007 marriage to Max Sandlin, she was known as Stephanie Herseth. She is a Democrat and a member of the Herseth family of South Dakota. She and Senator Tim Johnson are the last Democrats to win a statewide and/or federal election in South Dakota.

Since 2017, she has served as president of Augustana University.

==Early life and education==
Stephanie Herseth was born on December 3, 1970, the daughter of Joyce (née Styles) and Ralph Lars Herseth, and was raised on her family&#x27;s farm near Houghton. Her father&#x27;s family had been active for two generations in South Dakota politics. Her paternal grandfather, Ralph Herseth, was the governor of South Dakota, and her paternal grandmother, Lorna Herseth, was South Dakota&#x27;s secretary of state. Her father, Lars Herseth, served in the South Dakota State Legislature for two decades and ran for governor in 1986. Her ancestry includes German and Norwegian.

Herseth graduated from Groton High School in Groton, South Dakota. She earned her B.A. from Georgetown University in 1993 and her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1997.

==Career prior to Congress==
After law school, Herseth worked as a judicial law clerk to Judge Charles B. Kornmann of the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota and Judge Diana Gribbon Motz on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. She worked in private practice as an attorney in Washington, D.C., and taught at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Before her election to the House, Herseth was executive director of the South Dakota Farmer&#x27;s Union Foundation and served on the board of directors of First Bank and Trust of Brookings, South Dakota.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Committees===

During her tenure in the House, Herseth Sandlin was assigned to committees of concern to her constituency. The Agriculture Committee affects South Dakota&#x27;s largest industry, and the Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction over national forests in the Black Hills and policies affecting the state&#x27;s nine federally recognized Native American tribes. She was selected to serve on the Select Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence based upon her work on issues related to biofuels and renewable energy in rural America.

Herseth Sandlin was a senior whip in the House and co-chaired the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition.

===Voting record===
Herseth Sandlin voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act. She said she would &quot;not vote for the Senate bill as is&quot; and would &quot;not vote for a package of changes that would go through the reconciliation process.&quot;

Herseth Sandlin opposed her party&#x27;s leadership on some issues related to gun rights, which won her the support of the NRA Political Victory Fund. She is pro-choice and expressed opposition to Referred Law 6, which sought to ban abortions in South Dakota, including those for victims of incest and rape. She supported the Employment Nondiscrimination Act in 2007.

Early in the 2008 presidential election cycle, Herseth Sandlin supported Senator John Edwards. On February 26, 2008, she endorsed Barack Obama.

==Political campaigns==

===2002===

Herseth ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2002, losing a high-profile race to Republican nominee Bill Janklow by a smaller than expected margin.

===2004===

After Janklow was convicted of manslaughter in a motor vehicle accident, he resigned his seat, effective January 20, 2004, triggering a special election. Herseth was the Democratic nominee, and on June 1, 2004, defeated Republican nominee Larry Diedrich with 51% of the vote. The victory gave South Dakota its first all-Democratic congressional delegation since 1937, including Senators Tom Daschle and Tim Johnson.

In the regularly scheduled election in November 2004, Herseth beat Diedrich again, with 53.4% of the vote. The vote margin in June was about 3,000 votes, but by the November election, which included a hard-fought contest for Daschle&#x27;s Senate seat, it grew to more than 29,000. Both the 2004 special and general elections were close compared to most House races the country, and garnered national attention.

===2006===

In November 2006, Herseth defeated Republican nominee Bruce Whalen. She received the second-highest vote total for a Democratic candidate for the House in 2006.

===2010===

Herseth Sandlin was mentioned as a possible, even likely, candidate for governor of South Dakota in 2010, but announced on July 7, 2009, that she would seek reelection to the House.

Before the Democratic primary, Kevin Weiland, a physician who had begun a campaign against Herseth Sandlin but had not yet filed to be on the ballot, called off his efforts. He said he had &quot;concern for what the net effect would be on our political party retaining the seat in the next Congress, but also after receiving assurances from Stephanie that she will not vote to repeal the recently passed health care reform law.&quot; He spoke to Democratic party leaders as well as Herseth Sandlin before making this decision. The Republican nominee, State Representative Kristi Noem, charged that Weiland&#x27;s decision not to run was due to Herseth Sandlin trading her vote for personal gain. Herseth Sandlin strongly denied the allegation and said there was no &quot;quid pro quo&quot; arrangement between her and Weiland.

During the campaign, Noem also criticized Herseth Sandlin&#x27;s husband, Max Sandlin, a lobbyist and former congressman. Noem said his list of clients included companies that had interests in legislation that would come before Congress, and suggested he would have improper influence because of his marriage. The &quot;Rapid City Journal&quot; editorial board wrote that Herseth Sandlin should take this concern seriously. &quot;Roll Call&quot; called Noem&#x27;s charges an attempt &quot;to stoke anti-Beltway emotions&quot;. Herseth Sandlin&#x27;s campaign responded that she did not allow family members to lobby her or her staff.

Herseth Sandlin&#x27;s campaign was hampered by the state Democratic Party&#x27;s inability to field a candidate against Republican nominee John Thune for U.S. Senate; &quot;by letting him breeze to re-election, Republicans could turn all their energy and money to the House race, and state Rep. Kristi Noem was able to unseat Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, the last best hope for a Democratic future in the state.&quot;

Noem defeated Herseth Sandlin in the November 2 general election with 48.14% of the vote to Herseth Sandlin&#x27;s 45.9%.

==Post-congressional career==
After losing reelection, Herseth Sandlin joined the Washington, D.C., firm of Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Matz as a principal attorney focusing on federal laws and regulations. She told &quot;Roll Call&quot; that she might register to lobby Congress after the expiration of the mandatory one-year waiting period that bars former members from doing so. Ultimately, she did not register as a lobbyist after the cooling-off period ended.

Although Herseth Sandlin did not run in 2012, political commentators suggested that she might seek the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Tim Johnson in 2014. Ultimately, she decided not to run, citing her son and her desire to continue in her role as Legal Counsel at Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Herseth Sandlin served briefly as an adjunct professor at the Department of Political Science at South Dakota State University. In February 2017, it was announced that she would become the 24th president of Augustana University, a liberal arts college in Sioux Falls.

==Personal life==
In March 2007, Herseth married Max Sandlin, a four-term Democratic congressman from Texas and registered lobbyist with the lobbying and public relations firm Mercury, who is 18 years her senior. The couple met when Herseth first ran for Congress in 2002. He was defeated for reelection in 2004.

Upon her marriage, she became known as Stephanie Herseth Sandlin. The couple has a son, born in 2008.

<doc id="698192" wikidata="Q7830602" url="?curid=698192" title="Toyetic">
<text>Toyetic is a term referring to the suitability of a media property, such as a cartoon or movie, for merchandising tie-in lines of licensed toys, games and novelties. The term is attributed to Bernard Loomis, a toy development executive for Kenner Toys, in discussing the opportunities for marketing the film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, telling its producer Steven Spielberg that the movie was not &quot;toyetic&quot; enough, leading Loomis towards acquiring the lucrative license for the upcoming &quot;Star Wars&quot; properties.

==History==
The concept of toyetic works is stated to have come from Bernard Loomis in 1969, while working at Mattel. With the introduction of the Hot Wheels line of toy cars, Loomis proposed that they also developed a 30-minute show &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; as a means to promote the toys. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in reviewing the show, determined that the program needed to be treated as advertising, which affected the records of the network, forcing the show to be taken off the air within two years. Loomis later moved on to the Kenner division of General Mills; during this time, he had read about the upcoming &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, and positioned the company to produce toys based on the film. The move was considered highly successful, with over $100 million in annual toy sales following the release of the film.

In the early 1980s, the FCC revised its rules on children&#x27;s programming, specifically allowing for the use of &quot;character marketing&quot; where shows could employ fictional characters based on toys and other real-world objects without counting towards advertising. Loomis saw the same potential in the &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; line of toys as he did for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and was able to successfully produce a line of specials for &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; under the less-restrictive FCC guidelines. Following on Loomis&#x27;s success, toyetic shows became popular in the 1980s. This was aided by the introduction of cable television that allows for more airtime for new and repeat broadcasts of such shows. The number of toyetic shows waned after 1990 when the United States Congress passed the Children&#x27;s Television Act which required content to include educational and instructional material for children, and targeted the type of commercial advertising that could accompany these shows.

==Examples==
Notable examples of toyetic properties include:

* Batman &amp; Robin: Toy companies were reportedly involved in pre-production. Director Joel Schumacher admitted that he was told by Warner executives to make &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; &quot;more toyetic&quot;. Despite the film&#x27;s disappointing critical and financial performance, toy revenue was so high that the studio produced more Batman films without Schumacher.
*Star Wars: Although George Lucas wrote the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga without considering the toyetic potentials of the film, he insisted that he would keep the merchandising rights before the first film was released. 20th Century-Fox underestimated the potential of the film and allowed Lucas to do so, and the film turned out to be a toyetic phenomenon. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have spawned a massive merchandising empire, including toys, action figures, and video games to non-toy merchandise, such as beer steins, spoons, and replicas of the lightsaber hilts.
* Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Based on the 1984 comic series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird of the same name, the television shows and movies were considered &quot;extremely toyetic&quot;, as the toys were &quot;visually appealing—tough yet huggable—and there are enough characters to drive collecting over time&quot;, according to Playmates Toys senior vice president Karl Aaronian.
* Transformers: The success of the 2007 film based on the franchise is stated by Lauren A. E. Schuker of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to have created a drive in the motion picture industry to seek rights for toy-driven films from other existing properties.

<text>TND is a television station in Darwin, Northern Territory. The station, launched in 1998 as &quot;Seven Darwin&quot; and broadcasting across Darwin, Palmerston and surrounding areas, is owned by Southern Cross Austereo. Its main competitor is the Nine Network&#x27;s owned-and-operated station, NTD.

==Programming==
As &quot;Seven Darwin&quot;, TND-34 existed as essentially a re-broadcast of SCB&#x27;s remote Australia satellite service Seven Central, apart from localised adverts, inserted at SCB&#x27;s playout centre in Townsville, Queensland, and delivered to Darwin via Optus Transcontinental Fibre Optic cable. The station also carries &quot;Seven News Brisbane&quot; bulletins from BTQ.

From 2005 until 2008, the station held affiliations with Network 10, after the Ten affiliation was relinquished by NTD-8 as it became &quot;Nine Darwin&quot;. At this time, &quot;Seven Darwin&quot; changed its name to &quot;Southern Cross Darwin&quot;. Since 2008, the station only holds affiliations with the Seven Network.

Like its Tasmanian and Spencer Gulf/Broken Hill sister stations, the Seven Network affiliation remains the primary one. The Network Ten affiliation was, in 2008, expected to be dropped from Southern Cross Darwin and given to a digital-only third channel (such as those found in Tasmania and Mildura), as proposed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Despite the change in name and affiliation of TND-34, Seven Central remained as a fully Seven Network-aligned service for remote Australia. Since 2008, Seven Central has carried a small amount of Ten Sport programming, in response to rival broadcaster Imparja Television dropping its Network Ten licence early in the year.

In 2008, Southern Cross Darwin ceased broadcasting its last Ten content, as it was moved to Darwin Digital Television. The station has carried a sole Seven affiliate, on relay from Melbourne instead of Brisbane or Adelaide, despite time zone differences between Northern Territory and Victoria.

On 1 July 2018, local branding on all of Southern Cross&#x27; Seven-affiliated stations was phased out to be replaced by generic Seven Network branding. Consequently, &quot;Southern Cross Darwin&quot; became &quot;Seven Darwin&quot;, the station&#x27;s original identity that had not been in use for the past ten years.

Seven Darwin has the rights to broadcast AFL NT matches on their sister channel 7TWO during the AFL Season. The matches usually air on weekends as daytime viewing.

7HD launched on 26 November 2018.

== News updates ==
Under previous owners, a local &quot;Seven News&quot; bulletin for Darwin and Central Australia was produced until 2000. Separate news update services for Darwin were introduced in 2005 before being merged with updates for remote Australia into one service in 2013 - the updates were later separate in 2018. The shared three-minute short news updates throughout the day are broadcast on ITQ/QQQ serving remote areas and TND in Darwin, presented from Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s studio in Hobart by Madeline Kerr.

<doc id="698196" wikidata="Q278595" url="?curid=698196" title="Catamenia (band)">
<text>Catamenia is a Finnish black metal band founded in 1995 by Riku Hopeakoski and Mika Tönning in Oulu. They have been signed to Massacre Records since their first full-length release &quot;Halls of Frozen North&quot; in 1998. As of 2010, they have released nine albums, one EP, and one DVD. They are known for frequent usage of wolves in their album art, but the band is named after a kind of bird. Catamenia also means &quot;menstruation&quot;, which the band did not know until a fan pointed it out to them after the release of their debut album.

== History ==
They released their first demo album in their first active year, simply titled &quot;Demo &#x27;95&quot;. Their second demo, &quot;Winds&quot; released in 1996, led to a four-album contract with Massacre Records in 1997. Their debut full-length album &quot;Halls of Frozen North&quot; was recorded in Commusication Studios, Beindersheim, Germany, in 1997 with Gerhard Magin (Crematory, Mystic Circle) and was released in 1998. A year later they recorded their second album, &quot;Morning Crimson&quot; (1999) in Sweden, at Sunlight Studios with Thomas Skogsberg (Katatonia, Dismember). The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Eternal Winter&#x27;s Prophecy&quot; was recorded in their home country in 2000 at Tico-Tico Studios with Ahti Kortelainen (Kalmah, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Dawn of Relic). Their last album for Massacre Records was entitled &quot;Eskhata&quot;, released in 2002, recorded in Oulu, Finland at SoundMix Studios with producer Mika Pohjola (The Black League). After the release and promotion of &quot;Eskhata&quot;, Catamenia renewed their contract with Massacre Records for three more albums, citing good working relations.

Catamenia faced many line-up changes during the rehearsal of their fifth album, but their line-up steadied and again were a six-piece for its release.

Catamenia recorded their fifth album &quot;Chaos Born&quot; at Neo Studio in Oulu, Finland with Kari Vähäkuopus and Immu Ilmarinen (Burning Point, Embraze, Afterworld, Sentenced). &quot;ChaosBorn&quot; combines melodics and aggressive metal. After praise from media and their fans for &quot;ChaosBorn&quot;, &quot;Winternight Tragedies&quot; was stated as their sixth studio release, again with Mastervox Studios and producers Kakke Vähäkuopus and Immu Ilmarinen.

While working on &quot;Winternight Tragedies&quot;, the band encountered problems with collaboration, distance and lack of practice. As a result, line-up changes were made. Vocalist Mika and bassist Timo were replaced by new vocalist O.J. Mustonen and bassist Mikko Hepo-oja.

The album features raw, aggressive and angry songs while still keeping the melodious background intact.

In 2006, their seventh album, &quot;&quot; was released. Later that year, a DVD entitled, &quot;Bringing the Cold to Poland&quot;, was released featuring live recordings at the Stodola Club in Warsaw, Poland.

Drummer Veikko Jumisko departed from Catamenia in Spring 2007 because he was not able to join the tour anymore.

The US tour was postponed until 2008, because of promotion problems. A short Canadian tour called Brothers of Cold took place in May 2008.

In May 2008, Olli Mustonen left the band for undisclosed reasons. It is believed since he missed the Canadian tour, he was deemed unreliable. Ari Nissilä will take over lead vocals from now on.

In December 2009 Catamenia started the recording of their upcoming album called &quot;Cavalcade&quot;. It was released via Massacre Records on 26 February 2010.

In September 2010, Ari Nissilä, Toni Kansanoja, Mikko Nevanlahti and Kari Vähäkuopus decided to leave the band, but already in early October, there were new members attached to the band – bassist Mikko Hepo-oja, drummer Tony Qvick and guitarist Sauli Jauhiainen. Later on the band attached new singer Juha-Matti Perttunen and keyboardist Jussi Sauvola to the band.

Their most recent album, &quot;The Rewritten Chapters&quot; was released on 27 April 2012.

<text>Kerry Matthew Stokes (born John Patrick Alford on 13 September 1940) is an Australian businessman. He holds business interests in industries including electronic and print media, property, mining and construction equipment. He is most widely known as the chairman of the Seven Network, one of the largest broadcasting corporations in Australia.

Appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1995, Stokes was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 2006 in recognition of his contributions to Australian business, strategic leadership, promotion of corporate social responsibility, to the arts through philanthropy, and to the community, most especially those services supporting young people.

, Stokes was the twelfth-richest Australian by net worth, according to the 2023 Financial Review Rich List.

==Early life==
John Patrick Alford was born in Melbourne, Victoria. His unmarried mother was Marie Jean Alford. Stokes was adopted by Matthew and Irene Stokes and grew up in Camp Pell, a slum housing area. He later dropped out of school at age 14. In June 2000, Stokes told the &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;My background was very difficult, very hard and I wouldn&#x27;t wish that on anybody. I had lots of different occupations and obviously lots of different experiences. I had some time on the street, and sometimes, work was very difficult. Australia, in that period of time, wasn&#x27;t a place where you could actually easily go and get a job, it was difficult, and we went where there was work available&quot;.

==Career==
Stokes&#x27; first reported job was to install television antennas in Perth, followed by a sustained period in property development throughout the 1960s and 1970s. He also developed a range of shopping centres in Perth and regional Western Australia with partners Jack Bendat and Kevin Merifield.

His private company, Australian Capital Equity, is the holding company for Stokes&#x27; interests in a diverse range of Australian and international businesses and ventures covering property, construction, mining and petroleum exploration.

He invested in the Caterpillar franchise in Western Australia (Wigmores Ltd) in 1988, and the company subsequently called WesTrac has equipment dealer franchises in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, with the total number of employees close to 4,000 people, as well as 500 apprentices in Australia.

In 2007, Stokes&#x27; National Hire Group (over 50% owned by WesTrac) formed a joint venture with The Carlyle Group to acquire the equipment hire group Coates Hire.

Stokes has always had a keen interest in the pastoral industry and acquired the Napier Downs station in the Kimberley, stocked with 20,000 head of Red Brahman cattle, from Peter Leutenegger in 2015 for an estimated 23 million to 40 million.

, Seven Group Holdings increased the size of Stokes&#x27; privately owned cattle empire in Western Australia to more than .

===Media interests===
Stokes&#x27;s commercial interests in the media sector commenced in Western Australia, with the development of the Golden West Network, a regional television network based in Bunbury in partnership with Jack Bendat. In 1979 Stokes acquired Canberra&#x27;s local TV station Seven Canberra, subsequently acquiring Seven Adelaide from Rupert Murdoch and won the third commercial station licence in Perth, as well as acquiring radio stations in Victoria (including 3DB (Melbourne) and 3GL (Geelong), South Australia and Western Australia, through a vehicle called BDC. These assets were sold to Frank Lowy in 1987.

In 1996 Stokes acquired a strategic 19 per cent stake in the Seven Network (now approximately 43 per cent), a network of commercial free-to-air television stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, as well as regional Queensland and Perth. This was supported by Alan Jackson, who Stokes appointed CEO of the company for a number of years. The platform, as well as a 33 per cent stake in Sky News Australia, reaches 98 per cent of Australians. Seven has also established a major magazine publishing business, Pacific Magazines, which accounts for more than 20 per cent of all magazines sold in Australia.

Also under Stokes&#x27;s leadership, Seven has established a leading online venture, Yahoo!7, combining Yahoo!&#x27;s search and online capabilities with Seven&#x27;s content and cross marketing. The successful joint venture is driving a range of online and IPTV businesses. Seven built and acquired several broadband businesses, including wireless broadband group Unwired (sold to Optus, and subsequently defunct), VOIP operator Engin (subsequently an independent business) and was the Australian licensee for TiVo, launched in 2008 and abandoned in 2014.

In 2006, Seven Network and KKR created a new joint venture, Seven Media Group, a multi-faceted media company combining a presence in broadcast television, magazine and online applications. West Australian Newspapers Ltd. merged with Seven to form Seven West Media in 2011.

Stokes&#x27;s private company, in conjunction with Shanghai People&#x27;s Press, is no longer running a business after five years in Shanghai. and a second joint venture in mobile television with the Oriental Pearl Group in Shanghai. Seven held the Australian broadcasting rights for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and provided the broadcast feeds for the swimming and diving events for the rest of the world. The International Olympic Committee awarded Seven the gold medal for its TV coverage of the Athens Summer Olympics in 2004.

==Personal life==
Stokes has been married four times. His first marriage was to Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Ebert, who is the mother of two of his children, Russell and Raelene. In an interview with &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, it was implied that Stokes was estranged from his first family. His second marriage was to his receptionist, Denise Bryant, with whom he had two sons. Denise walked out of the marriage and went overseas, and Stokes became a single father. His third marriage was to Australian television actress Peta Toppano in 1992. This marriage lasted for three years. In 1996 he married his fourth wife, Christine Simpson (née Parker), a newsreader for rival station Channel 10 when they first met. Stokes has three grandchildren.

=== Net worth ===
, &quot;Forbes&quot; assessed Stokes&#x27; net worth as 2.90 billion. , &quot;the Australian Financial Review&quot; assessed Stokes&#x27; net worth as 7.45 billion, the twelfth-richest Australian; and he was one of ten Australians who have appeared in every &quot;Financial Review Rich List&quot;, or its predecessor, the &quot;BRW Rich 200&quot;, since it was first published in 1984.


===Philanthropy===
In 1995 Stokes was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for service to business and commerce to the arts and to the community. In 2008 Stokes was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for service to business and commerce through strategic leadership and promotion of corporate social responsibility, to the arts through executive roles and philanthropy, and to the community, particularly through contributions to organisations supporting youth. His passionate interest in art coincides with his long association with the National Gallery of Australia, where he served as chairman for several years and has made multimillion-dollar donations.

He has also been awarded the Rotary Paul Harris Fellow Award by Rotary International and holds a life membership of the Returned and Services League of Australia, on whose behalf Stokes has acquired three Victoria Crosses, as well as other medals. These medals have been added to the collection of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. He now sits on the council of the War Memorial.

In November 2012, Stokes was named Western Australia&#x27;s Australian of the Year for his extensive philanthropic contributions to Australian society. In 1994, Stokes delivered the Boyer Lectures, a series of five lectures broadcast annually on ABC radio. His series was entitled &quot;Advance Australia Where?&quot; on the topic of the Information Superhighway. He delivered the Andrew Olle Media Lecture in October 2001.

====Victoria Cross====
Stokes has taken an active role in preserving Australian ownership of significant military heritage; he has now purchased three Australian Victoria Cross medal sets, and a George Cross medal set. Stokes has purchased all four sets via auction from Bonhams &amp; Goodman of Sydney, Australia. The first was the VC medal set of Captain Alfred John Shout, paying a world record price of 1.2 million on 24 July 2006. In the same auction, he purchased the GC medal set of Lieutenant Commander George Gosse for 180,000. On 28 November of the same year, Stokes purchased the VC set of Lance Corporal Bernard Gordon for A$478,000. He donated all three sets to the Australian War Memorial.

On 20 May 2008, Stokes, in conjunction with the South Australian Government, purchased the Victoria Cross medal set of Major Peter Badcoe for 480,000. The Badcoe medals were on public display in the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, and on tour in South Australia, for twelve months before going on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Controversy==
On 23 April 2020, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, Stokes and his wife, Christine Simpson, were granted quarantine within their own home after returning from a skiing trip in Colorado instead of in a hotel on medical grounds. However, it was unclear why Simpson was also given an exemption to strict State and Federal laws at the time.

After Seven Network employee and former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith sued the publishers of &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; for defamation, it was reported in 2020 that Stokes’ private investment company, Australian Capital Equity, had extended a line of credit to Roberts-Smith of around A$2 million to help fund his legal case. Roberts-Smith reportedly offered his Victoria Cross medal as collateral for the loan. On 1 June 2023 Australian federal court Judge Anthony Besanko dismissed the case, ruling that, on the balance of probabilities, the papers had established substantial or contextual truth of allegations of war crimes committed by Roberts-Smith.

<text>Sinn Sisamouth (c. 1932 – c. 1976) was a Cambodian singer-songwriter active from the 1950s to the 1970s. Widely considered the &quot;King of Khmer Music&quot;, Sisamouth, along with Ros Serey Sothea, Pen Ran, Mao Sareth, and other Cambodian artists, was part of a thriving pop music scene in Phnom Penh that blended elements of Khmer traditional music with the sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll to develop a Cambodian rock sound. Sisamouth died during the Khmer Rouge regime under circumstances that are unclear.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sinn Sisamouth was born in Kampong Thom Province, the son of Sinn Leang and mother Seb Bunlei. One or both of Sisamouth&#x27;s parents were partially Lao. Most sources list his year of birth as 1935, though some list 1932 or 1933. 23 August 1933 is generally accepted as his date of birth. Some people that had been alive during Sisamouth&#x27;s era state that he was born during the Rooster zodiac, which includes the year 1933. Sisamouth&#x27;s father was a soldier during the Colonial Cambodia period and also served as prison warden in Battambang Province. His father died when he was a child and his mother then remarried.

Sisamouth learned to play stringed instruments at the age of six or seven, and showed a natural singing talent. He was often invited to perform music at school functions. At about age 16 he graduated from primary school and moved to Phnom Penh to study medicine; this plan was apparently meant to please his parents when his true goal was to become a musician. He began composing his own songs around this time.

Sisamouth graduated from medical school around the time that Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953. He initially worked in a Phnom Penh hospital as a nurse, but was soon hired by the Cambodian national radio station as a singer with its band. Around this time, Sisamouth married his cousin Keo Thorng Gnu in an arranged marriage, and they eventually had four children.

===Music career===
While performing with the Cambodian national radio station, Sisamouth became a protege of Queen Sisowath Kossamak, mother of Head of State Norodom Sihanouk. The Queen invited Sisamouth to join the Vong Phleng Preah Reach Troap (the classical ensemble of the Royal Treasury) with which he performed at royal receptions and state functions. He also achieved hit songs on national radio around this time, first writing and performing songs based on traditional Khmer music. In the mid-1950s, the romantic ballad &quot;Violon Sneha&quot;, composed by violinist Hass Salan, catapulted Sisamouth into stardom across Cambodia.
Sisamouth became known for his crooning voice, which has been likened to that of Nat King Cole, while his stage presence has been compared to that of Frank Sinatra. By the late 1950s, Sisamouth had established himself as the leading figure in an expanding Cambodian pop music scene. Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into the country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing music scene based in Phnom Penh.

The music produced by Sisamouth and his contemporaries had become popular throughout the country; in 1965, Sisamouth&#x27;s song &quot;Champa Battambang&quot; was the first content played on Khmer Republic Television. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Cambodian music scene was further influenced by Western rock and roll and soul music via U.S. armed forces radio that had been broadcast into nearby South Vietnam. This resulted in a unique sound in which Western pop and rock were combined with Khmer vocal techniques. Sisamouth was a leader of these trends, moving from traditional Khmer music and romantic ballads to Latin jazz, cha cha cha, agogo, and eventually psychedelic rock in which he employed younger rock musicians. Sisamouth also made use of bossa nova and doo-wop influences.

Sisamouth had become established as Cambodia&#x27;s most popular singer and songwriter. Nevertheless, his popularity did not eclipse that of other recording artists such as Eum Song Seurm and Huoy Meas. He collaborated directly with Mao Sareth and Chounn Malay, among others. He also wrote songs for, and duetted with, other popular Cambodian singers to nurture their careers. For example, starting in the mid-1960s he recorded many popular duets with Pen Ran.

Sisamouth is credited with launching the career of Ros Serey Sothea, who had been singing at weddings and later became the leading female singer in the Cambodian rock scene. Sisamouth and Sothea recorded many very popular duets from the mid-1960s into the early 1970s. In later years, Sisamouth contributed songs to the soundtracks for a number of popular Cambodian films, such as &quot;Orn Euy Srey Orn&quot;, &quot;Tep Sodachan&quot;, and &quot;Thavory Meas Bong&quot;.

Sisamouth&#x27;s highly prolific songwriting became well known during this period; he is confirmed to have written more than one thousand songs for himself and others (see Sinn Sisamouth discography), and the true total may be considerably higher. His son Sinn Chanchhaya believed that Sisamouth wrote roughly one song for every day that he was a professional musician, a period of nearly 20 years. In 1973 the music publisher Kruorch Bunlyhe issued &quot;A Collection of Sentimental Songs&quot;, which contained 500 of Sinn Sisamouth&#x27;s songs.

He was also known to adapt popular Western pop and rock songs with new Khmer lyrics, such as a song based on Santana&#x27;s &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; called &quot;Srolanh Srey Touch&quot; (translated as &quot;I Love Petite Girls&quot; in English-language compilations); plus covers of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; by The Beatles (titled &quot;Always Will Hope&quot;), &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; by Procol Harum (titled &quot;Apart from Love&quot;), and &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; by The Searchers (titled &quot;Other Than You&quot;). By the 1970s he was working regularly with lyricist Voy Ho, and had adapted some traditional and popular Thai songs into his repertoire (for example, &quot;Promden Jet&quot; with Ros Serey Sothea).

During the Cambodian Civil War in the early 1970s, Sisamouth was a supporter of the Khmer Republic military and recorded patriotic songs supporting the Republic&#x27;s stance against the Khmer Rouge insurgents. His career would continue until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in April 1975.

===Disappearance and death===
Sinn Sisamouth disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide and his exact fate has never been confirmed, with multiple sources making contradictory claims. Due to his ongoing popularity with the Cambodian people, there has been a great amount of speculation about his whereabouts after the Khmer Rouge forced the evacuation of all residents from Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and his apparent death at the hands of the new regime. In the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot;, an interview subject speculates that Sisamouth was originally evacuated to a small village but was then ordered to return to the city to work for the Khmer Rouge in some capacity, but it is unknown if he in fact followed this plan.

Also in &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot;, Sisamouth&#x27;s son states that many different people have given him contradictory stories of his father&#x27;s death. Like many of his contemporaries, as a popular musician with Western influences, qualities widely known to be disdained by the Khmer Rouge, Sisamouth was likely to have been targeted for imprisonment or execution immediately.

A popular but apocryphal story claims that Sisamouth was about to be executed by a Khmer Rouge firing squad but requested the opportunity to sing one last song in an attempt to appeal to the soldiers&#x27; emotions, but they executed him anyhow. In 2006, &quot;Khmer Apsara&quot; magazine granted a long interview to a man named Keo Chamnab who claims to have seen Sisamouth&#x27;s execution at a jail in Prek Ta Duong village in 1976.
In 2009, Sisamouth&#x27;s son claimed to know the name of his father&#x27;s executioner and that the person was still alive. Whatever the cause, Sisamouth almost certainly died during the Khmer Rouge regime but his remains have never been discovered.

==Legacy==
Many of Sinn Sisamouth&#x27;s master recordings were either destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime in its efforts to eliminate foreign influences from Cambodian society, or were lost due to decay. However, collectors and entrepreneurs located and reproduced copies of some of his recordings after the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Some of his songs have been covered by modern Cambodian singers, such as &quot;Srey Sros Khmeng&quot; by Suong Chantha in 2002. Western listeners were introduced to his work starting in the late 1990s with the release of the &quot;Cambodian Rocks&quot; bootleg album, followed by the soundtrack to the film &quot;City of Ghosts&quot;.

Because his influence on Cambodian music was so great, Sisamouth is still a household name in Cambodia and remains popular to this day. He is extensively profiled in the 2015 documentary film on the history of Cambodian popular music, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot;, in which several interview subjects describe Sisamouth as the most important Cambodian musician of all time. The film takes its title from a Sisamouth song. Often called the &quot;King of Khmer music,&quot; &quot;the Cambodian Elvis,&quot; or the &quot;golden voice,&quot; his lasting cultural impact is difficult to overstate.

While Sisamouth is believed to have written well over one thousand songs, most have been lost while others that survived were copied and sold without any benefits going to his family. Cambodia passed its first copyright law in 2003, allowing families to claim the artists&#x27; intellectual property for the first time. In 2014, Sisamouth&#x27;s family provided proof of composition and was awarded copyright ownership for over 180 songs. The event was commemorated with a celebration and tribute concert. However, the nation of Cambodia has also claimed Sisamouth&#x27;s songs as state property, in another indication of his popularity and influence.

Sisamouth&#x27;s son Sinn Chanchhaya became a singer for the Cambodian Radio, though he admitted he could not be compared to his father. Chanchhaya died in 2015. A tribute concert titled &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Give Back: A Tribute to the Golden Voice of Cambodia,&quot; promoting Sisamouth&#x27;s music and the need for intellectual property benefits for his family and the families of his contemporaries, was held in Phnom Penh in November 2015. In 2023, former Kun Khmer boxer Bout Samrech claimed he is Sisamouth&#x27;s son. According to Samrech, Sisamouth had taken his mother as a secret mistress, and he learned that Sisamouth was his &quot;father&quot; at the age of 14 when informed about it by his foster mother.

Documentary filmmakers Chris G. Parkhurst and Stephanie Vincenti have produced a documentary about Sinn Sisamouth called &quot;Elvis of Cambodia&quot;. The film is 74 minutes long and is available in Khmer and English.

<doc id="698212" wikidata="Q635103" url="?curid=698212" title="Architectural design competition">
<text>An architectural design competition is a type of design competition in which an organization that intends on constructing a new building invites architects to submit design proposals. The winning design is usually chosen by an independent panel of design professionals and stakeholders (such as government and local representatives). This procedure is often used to generate new ideas for building design, to stimulate public debate, generate publicity for the project, and allow emerging designers the opportunity to gain exposure. Architecture competitions are often used to award commissions for public buildings: in some countries rules for tendering public building contracts stipulate some form of mandatory open architectural competition.

Winning first prize in a competition is not a guarantee that the project will be constructed. The commissioning body often has the right to veto the winning design, and both requirements and finances may change, thwarting the original intention. The 2002 World Trade Center site design competition is an example of a highly publicized competition where only the basic elements of the winning design by Daniel Libeskind appeared in the finished project.

==History==
Architecture competitions have a more than 2,500-year-old history. The Acropolis in Athens was a result of an architectural competition in 448 B.C., as were several cathedrals in the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, many projects initiated by the Church have been decided through design competition. Examples are the Spanish Steps in Rome or in 1419, a competition was held to design the dome of the Florence Cathedral, which was won by Filippo Brunelleschi. Open competitions were held in the late 18th century in several countries including the United States, Great Britain, Ireland, France and Sweden.

In 19th century England and Ireland there have been over 2,500 competitions in five decades, with 362 in London alone. The Royal Institute of British Architects drafted a first set of rules in 1839 and a set of formal regulations in 1872. The German Regulations were introduced in 1867. In the same period in the Netherlands, an association for the advancement of architecture (&quot;Maatschappij tot Bevordering van de Bouwkunst&quot;), started organising conceptual competitions with the aim of stimulating architects&#x27; creativity.

==Competition types==
There are a variety of competition types resulting from the combination of following options:
* Open competitions (international, national or regional) or &quot;limited&quot;, &quot;selected&quot;, &quot;non-open&quot; competitions, depending on who is allowed to participate.
* Project competitions or &quot;ideas&quot; competitions: depending on the intention of building the project or generating new ideas.
* Single-stage or two-stage competitions: depending on the scale and complexity of the competition.
* Anonymous or cooperative procedures: anonymity supports greater objectivity during the evaluation and award-granting deliberations. In cooperative procedures, the authors are invited to make in-person presentations to the jury in order to explain their design strategies and allow individual discussion.
* Seasonal competitions, with periodical calls, such as Europan.
* Student design competitions.

==Rules and guidelines==
The rules of each competition are defined by the organiser; however, these often follow the guidelines provided by the International Union of Architects, respectively the relevant national or regional architecture organisation. Competition guidelines define roles, responsibilities, processes, and procedures within a competition and provide guidance on possible competition types, eligibility criteria, jury composition, participation conditions, payments, prizes, publication of results and other aspects.

In France and Germany design competitions are compulsory for all public buildings exceeding a certain cost.

==Major international architectural design competitions==

Most significant among architectural competitions are the ones which are internationally open, attract a large number of design submissions, and the winning design is built.

<text>The Varginha UFO incident involves a series of events in 1996 when residents of Varginha, Brazil, claimed seeing one or more strange creatures and at least one unidentified flying object (UFO). The reports garnered extensive media coverage. Other associated claims include the capture of one or more extraterrestrial beings by the Brazilian authorities, animal fatalities at a zoo, and a woman impregnated by an extraterrestrial. An investigation by the Brazilian Army concluded that a city resident was mistaken for an alien creature and the movement of military personnel in the region was routine.

==Overview==
According to media reports, a creature was sighted on the afternoon of 20 January 1996, by three women ranging from 14 to 22 years old. The women described the creature as a large headed biped with &quot;spots like veins on the skin and some bumps on the head [...] eyes were two red balls.&quot; The creature (later termed the &quot;ET de Varginha&quot;) seemed to be wobbly or unsteady, and the girls assumed it was injured or sick. They said that they fled and told their mother that they had seen the &quot;devil&quot;.

Rumors afterward began to spread through the area, with some people claiming to have observed UFOs in the days prior. Later, claims were made of additional unidentified creatures/extraterrestrials being collected and observed at a hospital, military/police/government trucks and personnel being active in the area, an unidentified animal &quot;prowling&quot; a local forest, the death of a police officer, and unexplained animal deaths occurring in the local zoo. Ufologists would later allege links between these and other claims, including the claim that one of the initial creature witnesses was impregnated by the creature.

==Inquiry==
An official inquiry led by the Brazilian military concluded in 2010 that the young women had encountered a homeless, mentally unstable man nicknamed &quot;Mudinho&quot;. The Commander of 24th Police Battalion Military &quot;presented photographs (...) a citizen known as Mudinho, who probably has some mental disability and whose physical characteristics matched the description (...) make it likely that the hypothesis that this citizen, probably being dirty, due to the heavy rains and seen crouching by a wall, was mistaken by the three terrified girls as a space creature.&quot; The head of the official inquiry also reported that the military trucks and personnel were performing routine duties on the night they were observed, stating, &quot;the presence of the Firefighters in Jardim Andere, the parking of Army trucks in the vicinity of the concessionaire where their periodic maintenance would be carried out ... and the departure of EsSA vehicles ... were real facts ... incorrectly interpreted as Firefighters and the Military participating in the capture and later the transport of the alleged creature to Campinas.&quot;

Skeptic Brian Dunning criticized sensational media accounts and ufologists&#x27; claims. According to Dunning, &quot;It is the most compelling example of a case where literally nothing at all happened that was remotely unusual, and was magnified into a case considered unassailable proof of alien visitation by many. To those believers, I would suggest recalibrating where you set the bar for quality of evidence.&quot;

==Notoriety==
These claims have markedly affected tourism to the city of Varginha. Grey alien dolls with football uniforms are sold at the location of the incident. Grey alien designs were used in advertising campaigns for the municipality. Bus stops were built in the form of spaceships and a 20 metres tall water tower with a disc-shaped water reservoir was erected in the town center called the Nave Espacial de Varginha.

==Media==
* &quot;1996&quot;, a 2020 short film by director Rodrigo Brandão, revisits the event in a horror story made along the lines of a documentary (in the style of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;). The story involves two teenagers going to the city of Varginha on 20 January 1996, who get lost in the woods at night and are found by an extraterrestrial.

<text>Nick Zedd ( James Franklyn Harding III; January 25, 1956 – February 27, 2022) was an American filmmaker, author, and painter based in Mexico City. He coined the term Cinema of Transgression in 1985 to describe a loose-knit group of like-minded filmmakers and artists using shock value and black humor in their work. These filmmakers and artistic collaborators included Richard Kern, Tessa Hughes Freeland, Lung Leg, Kembra Pfahler, Jack Smith and Lydia Lunch. Under numerous pen names, Zedd edited and wrote the &quot;Underground Film Bulletin&quot; (1984–1990) which publicized the work of these filmmakers. The Cinema of Transgression was explored in Jack Sargeant&#x27;s book &quot;Deathtripping&quot;.

==Early life==
Zedd was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, on January 25, 1956. Zedd moved to New York in 1976 to study at Brooklyn&#x27;s Pratt Institute and the School of Visual Arts.

== Career ==
Zedd directed several super-low-budget feature-length movies, including &quot;They Eat Scum&quot;, &quot;Geek Maggot Bingo&quot;, &quot;War Is Menstrual Envy&quot; and numerous short films. With Jen Miller, he was a co-creator of the public access series &quot;Electra Elf&quot; (2004–08), featuring New York artists and performers including Miller, Faceboy and Andrew J. Lederer. He served as director of photography on another TV series called &quot;Chop Chop&quot; (2007), produced by Nate Hill.

Additionally, Zedd acted in such low-budget movies as the Super 8 film &quot;Manhattan Love Suicides&quot; (1985), &quot;What About Me&quot; (1993), &quot;Bubblegum&quot; (1995), &quot;Jonas in the Desert&quot; (1997), &quot;Terror Firmer&quot; (1999), and &quot;Thus Spake Zarathustra&quot; (2001). He also appeared in the documentaries &quot;Llik Your Idols&quot; (2007) and &quot;Blank City&quot; (2010).

Zedd is the author of two autobiographical books, &quot;Bleed: Part One&quot; (1992) and &quot;Totem of the Depraved&quot; (1997), as well as the self-published novel &quot;From Entropy to Ecstasy&quot; (1996). He also contributed to the anthologies &quot;Up Is Up But So Is Down&quot;, &quot;Captured&quot; and &quot;Low Rent&quot;. In the 1980s Zedd published ten issues of the &quot;Underground Film Bulletin,&quot; a zine intended to promote the Cinema of Transgression. Issue 4 contained the &quot;Cinema of Transgression Manifesto,&quot; which was also published in &quot;The Theory of Xenomorphosis&quot; (1998).

In the early 1990s, Zedd toured with Lisa Crystal Carver&#x27;s Suckdog Circus, exhibiting his films. Performing with experimental noise music band Zyklon Beatles, Zedd released the &quot;Consume and Die&quot; 7-inch single on Rubric Records in 2000.

After exhibiting oil paintings in 2010 at the ADA and Pendu galleries, Zedd presented a major retrospective of films, videos, and paintings at the Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn.

In 2012, he attended a retrospective of his films at the eighth Berlin International Directors Lounge and exhibited work at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art in the same city.

In 2013, Zedd published &quot;The Extremist Manifesto&quot;, an essay denouncing contemporary art and the class structure that promotes it while announcing the emergence of the Extremist Art movement in Mexico City, which sought to subvert the edicts of established art institutions and curatorial ideologues. This manifesto, first released online, then in a self-published &quot;Hatred of Capitalism&quot; magazine issued in Mexico City (in English and Spanish) was reprinted a year later by the Museo Universitario del Chopo, along with two more issues as part of the &quot;Fanzinoteka&quot; exhibition. At a screening at the New Museum in New York, Zedd was presented with the Acker Award for Lifetime Achievement, a tribute given to &quot;members of the avant garde arts community who have made outstanding contributions in their discipline in defiance of convention, or else served their fellow writers and artists in outstanding ways&quot;.

In 2014, Zedd exhibited three motion pictures at the Museum of Modern Art in New York as part of a posthumous retrospective of films by Christoph Schlingensief, who had cited Zedd as a major influence on his work. Later in 2014, Zedd presented his first public exhibition of paintings in Mexico City, in a group show curated by Aldo Flores at Salon des Aztecas Gallery in Coyoacán. In 2015, Zedd presented his first one-man show of paintings at the V&amp;S Gallery in Mexico City. Zedd also shot an 8mm short entitled &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which was featured in the anthology film &quot;Impression X&quot; (2023).

== Personal life and death ==
An outsider artist throughout his life, Zedd never enjoyed commercial success with his films. By the mid-1980s, he regularly resorted to side hustles (such as being a taxi driver), to make ends meet. Peter LeVasseur, Zedd&#x27;s acquaintance at the time and a former East Village squatter, suggests that he contracted hepatitis C, during that period, from intravenous drug use. &quot;It had to be from intravenous drug use,&quot; LeVasseur says. &quot;He seemed to be on heroin and coke — both were fashionable at the time, the combo. This was when he was at his deepest, worst part. The pallor, his eyes and sunken cheeks. If you got in his car you’d be afraid&quot;.

Zedd died from complications from cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, and hepatitis C, in Mexico City, on February 27, 2022, at the age of 63. He was survived by his partner of 15 years, Monica Casanova, as well as a son and a step-daughter.

== Legacy ==
Founder of the Cinema of Transgression movement and part of the late 1970s and early 1980s No Wave group of underground filmmakers in New York City’s Lower East Side, Zedd exerted a significant influence over a number of directors, from Christoph Schlingensief to Quentin Tarantino. The latter paid tribute to him in his Palme d&#x27;Or-winning film, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), naming the main antagonist of the &quot;Gold Watch&quot; chapter Zed [&quot;sic&quot;].

The Canadian electronic music duo Zeds Dead took their name from the famous dialogue between Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) and Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) in Tarantino&#x27;s film, where he reveals to her that &quot;Zed&#x27;s dead&quot;.

Legendary cult filmmaker John Waters, who was as much a fan of Zedd&#x27;s lurid and provocative style, as Zedd was of his camp classics, like &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, wrote: &quot;Nick Zedd makes violent, perverted art films from Hell—he’s my kind of director!&quot;, and he considered the title of his debut film, &quot;They Eat Scum&quot;, as his favorite in cinema history. Similarly, fellow-East Village independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch said that &quot;Nick Zedd’s films are legendary — he is a truly seminal figure in the New York underground&quot;.

<doc id="698219" wikidata="Q550179" url="?curid=698219" title="Alan Bond">
<text>Alan Bond (22 April 1938 – 5 June 2015) was an Australian businessman noted for his high-profile and often corrupt business dealings. These included his central role in the WA Inc scandals of the 1980s; the biggest corporate collapse in Australian history; and also his criminal conviction that saw him serve four years in prison. He is also remembered for bankrolling the successful challenge for the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup, the first time the New York Yacht Club had lost it in its 132-year history. He is also the founder of Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia.

==Early life==
Alan Bond was born on 22 April 1938, the son of Frank and Kathleen Bond in the Hammersmith district of London, England. In 1950, aged 12, he emigrated to Australia with his parents and his elder sister Geraldine, living in Fremantle, near Perth. At the age of 14, he was charged with stealing and being unlawfully on premises. Aged 18, he was arrested for being unlawfully on premises, and reportedly admitted planning a robbery.

==Career==
Bond began his career as a signwriter under the name &#x27;Nu-Signs&#x27; after terminating his apprenticeship 18 months before it was due to end. In 1956 he was charged with attempted burglary, having been found by police roaming the streets of Fremantle dressed in State Electricity Commission overalls and carrying tools. Nu-Signs changed its name to Lesmurdie Heights – after the name of Bond&#x27;s biggest estate – and changed the name again to Bond Corporation in 1959. In the 1960s, as a property developer in an expanding market, he was one of WA&#x27;s largest borrowers from finance companies eager to lend to developers and uncritical of the valuations Bond put on his estates. Some of his developments included apartments along the Swan River and Lesmurdie Heights.


In his heyday the Perth-based Bond was one of Australia&#x27;s most prominent businesspeople. He extended his business interests into fields outside property development including brewing (he controlled Castlemaine Tooheys in Australia, leading the business to legal success in the landmark constitutional law case of &quot;Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia&quot;, and G. Heileman Brewing Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, US), gold mining, television, and airships. Australia&#x27;s first private university, Bond University, was founded by the Bond Corporation in 1987. He purchased QTQ-9 Brisbane and settled an outstanding defamation dispute the station had with the Queensland premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen by paying out A$400,000. He said in a television interview several years later that he paid because &quot;Sir Joh left no doubt that if we were going to continue to do business successfully in Queensland then he expected the matter to be resolved&quot;.

In 1987, Bond purchased Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s renowned painting &quot;Irises&quot; for $54 million—the highest price ever paid for a single painting at the time. However, the purchase was funded by a substantial loan from the auctioneer Sotheby&#x27;s, which Bond failed to repay. The transaction was criticised by art dealers as possibly a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate values generally (which it seems to have done). The painting was subsequently re-sold in 1990 to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

That same year, Bond also organised the establishment of the Bond Centre in Hong Kong, which was located in a twin tower skyscraper complex. The property was later bought by the Lippo Group of Indonesia, and is now known as the Lippo Centre.

===The America&#x27;s Cup===
Bond became a public hero in his adopted country when he bankrolled challenges for the America&#x27;s Cup, which resulted in his selection in 1978 as Australian of the Year (awarded jointly with Galarrwuy Yunupingu). His &quot;Australia II&quot; syndicate won the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup, which had been held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851, thus breaking the longest winning streak in the history of sport. That victory, widely regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s greatest international sporting achievements, resulted in Bond&#x27;s receipt of the Order of Australia, in the grade of Officer.

===Purchasing the Nine Network===
In 1987, Bond paid $1 billion to purchase the Australia-wide Channel Nine television network from Kerry Packer&#x27;s PBL. In a 2003 interview with Andrew Denton, Bond described the negotiations as follows:

...when we first sat down, we said, &#x27;We&#x27;re either going to sell our stations to you for $400 million, or you&#x27;re going to sell your stations to us.&#x27; And [Kerry Packer] said, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t really want to sell my stations.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Oh, is that right?&#x27; So, anyway, after much discussion, Kerry thumped the table and said, &#x27;Listen, if you can pay me $1 billion, I&#x27;ll sell them to you, otherwise bugger off&#x27;. ... [T]hen I rang the National Australia Bank. I said, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;m in discussions here to buy these television stations. Kerry will sell to me, and what I want to do is put our stations together and then, with Sky Channel, I&#x27;m going to float it off as a separate entity and raise the capital to pay for it... [Packer] said $1 billion [was his asking price], but I think I&#x27;ll get it for $800 million.&#x27; ... [The bank manager] duly rang back and said yes. I said, &#x27;Thank God. I&#x27;ll go and have some further negotiations with Kerry,&#x27; which I did. And true to his word, he never budged one penny off it. So I settled the deal with $800 million and a $200 million note. So he put his own $200 million in. So I had $1 billion. And we put our other two stations up as collateral, which were worth probably $400 million.

In fact, the agreed price was $1.05 billion. Packer took $800 million in cash and $250 million in subordinated debt in Bond Media.
When Bond went bankrupt, Packer was able to turn the debt into a 37% equity in Bond Media, which now included Channel 9 in Brisbane, and was worth about $500 million. It was valued at $1 billion, but had $500 million in debt on the books. Packer was quoted as saying &quot;You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I&#x27;ve had mine&quot;.

==Bankruptcy and conviction for fraud==
In 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt after failing to repay a $194 million personal guarantee on a loan for a nickel-mining project. His debts reportedly totalled $1.8 billion at the time. He feigned brain damage to avoid answering questions during bankruptcy trials, a charade he saw no need to keep up afterwards. He was forced to sell Glympton Park in England, which he purchased in 1988.

In 1995, his family bought him out of bankruptcy, with creditors accepting a payment of A$12 million, a little over half a cent per dollar.

In 1997, Bond was sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of the Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious and uncertain position. He was stripped of his 1984 honour as an Officer of the Order of Australia.

Bond was released from Karnet Prison Farm in 2000, having served four years in various Western Australian prisons.

==Return to investment activities==
Following release, he became active in various mining investments, predominately in Africa, including Madagascar Oil PLC and Global Diamond Resources, of Lesotho and was included in &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rich 200 List&quot; in 2008.

In 2003, Bond was inducted into the America&#x27;s Cup Hall of Fame. Since 2003, Bond had worked closely with his son Craig and longtime business partner Robert Quinn through Strategic Investments Ltd.

Interests related to the Bond family also control Global Diamond Resources plc (formerly Lesotho Diamond Corporation) which is developing the Kao diamond pipe in the Kingdom of Lesotho. In 2007, the Federal Court rejected an attempt by Bond to sue freelance journalist Paul Barry over an article Barry wrote about his dealings in Africa with the Lesotho Diamond Company. Bond had claimed that the article had several false statements. In 2008 Bond appealed but this, too, was rejected by the same court which found Bond&#x27;s claims had no reasonable prospects of success.

Bond was involved in a long-running defamation case against &quot;The West Australian&quot; newspaper and journalists Mark Drummond and Sean Cowan over a series of articles published in December 2005, in which it was alleged that Bond&#x27;s friend and business partner Robert Leslie Nelson was moving to hide Bond&#x27;s involvement in Lesotho Diamond Corporation, Madagascar Oil and a gold company. During that case, Bond tried to have the journalists convicted of contempt of court after some electronic documents disappeared.

In 2008, Bond made a return to the &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot;″s &quot;Rich 200 List&quot;, in 157th spot, with an estimated wealth of $265 million—thanks primarily to his stakes in Madagascar Oil and Global Diamond Resources.

==Family==
In 1955, Bond married Eileen Hughes, a member of a prominent Catholic family in Fremantle (she is a cousin of car dealer John Hughes). She and Bond were both 17, and she was pregnant at the time. Bond, who had been raised Protestant, converted to Catholicism for the marriage. The couple had four children: John, Craig, Susanne and Jody. Bond and Eileen divorced in 1992. Susanne, an equestrian showjumper who had been a member of the Australian showjumping team for seven years, died in 2000 from a suspected accidental overdose of prescription medication.

Bond married Diana Bliss, a public relations consultant and theatre producer, in 1995. On 28 January 2012, Bliss was found dead in the couple&#x27;s swimming pool. Police said the circumstances of her death were not suspicious and concluded that Bliss, a long-time sufferer of depression, had committed suicide.

==Illness and death==
On 2 June 2015, Bond underwent open-heart surgery at a private hospital in Perth to replace and repair his heart valves. Following complications, he was transferred to Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth and placed on life support in an induced coma. He died on the morning of 5 June 2015.

== In popular culture ==
John Wood portrayed Bond in the miniseries &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1986), which depicted Australia&#x27;s famous victory of the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup.

In the Australian TV miniseries &quot;Killing Time&quot; (2011), he was again played by John Wood.

The Australian TV miniseries &quot;House of Bond&quot; (2017) is a heavily fictionalised account of Bond&#x27;s life. Bond was portrayed by Ben Mingay. It was aired on the Nine Network on 24–25 April 2017.

In 2021, Perth-based psychedelic rock/pop band Pond released a song titled &quot;America&#x27;s Cup&quot; that would go on to appear on their ninth studio album, &quot;9&quot;; the song, which is about the drastic changes brought upon Perth in the aftermath of the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup, repeatedly mentions Bond with the line, &quot;Alan was a rolling stone&quot;.

In real life, Bond was represented by criminal lawyer Andrew Fraser, notable for representing Australian underworld figures and other unsavoury elements. Fraser himself would later become imprisoned.

<doc id="698220" wikidata="Q2260306" url="?curid=698220" title="Scintillometer">
<text>A scintillometer is a scientific device used to measure turbulent fluctuations of the refractive index of air caused by variations in temperature, humidity, and pressure. It consists of an optical or radio wave transmitter and a receiver at opposite ends of an atmospheric propagation path. The receiver detects and evaluates the intensity fluctuations of the transmitted signal, called scintillation.

The magnitude of the refractive index fluctuations is usually measured in terms of formula_1, the structure constant of refractive index fluctuations, which is the spectral amplitude of refractive index fluctuations in the inertial subrange of turbulence. Some types of scintillometers, such as displaced-beam scintillometers, can also measure the inner scale of refractive index fluctuations, which is the smallest size of eddies in the inertial subrange.

Scintillometers also allow measurements of the transfer of heat between the Earth&#x27;s surface and the air above, called the sensible heat flux. Inner-scale scintillometers can also measure the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy and the momentum flux.

<doc id="698223" wikidata="Q420950" url="?curid=698223" title="Phycoerythrin">
<text>Phycoerythrin (PE) is a red protein-pigment complex from the light-harvesting phycobiliprotein family, present in cyanobacteria, red algae and cryptophytes, accessory to the main chlorophyll pigments responsible for photosynthesis.The red pigment is due to the prosthetic group, phycoerythrobilin, which gives phycoerythrin its red color.

Like all phycobiliproteins, it is composed of a protein part covalently binding chromophores called phycobilins. In the phycoerythrin family, the most known phycobilins are: phycoerythrobilin, the typical phycoerythrin acceptor chromophore. Phycoerythrobilin is a linear tetrapyrrole molecule found in cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads. Together with other bilins such as phycocyanobilin it serves as a light-harvesting pigment in the photosynthetic light-harvesting structures of cyanobacteria called phycobilisomes. Phycoerythrins are composed of (αβ) monomers, usually organised in a disk-shaped trimer (αβ)3 or hexamer (αβ)6 (second one is the functional unit of the antenna rods). These typical complexes also contain a third type of subunit, the γ chain.

==Phycobilisomes==
Phycobiliproteins are part of huge light harvesting antennae protein complexes called phycobilisomes. In red algae they are anchored to the stromal side of thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, whereas in cryptophytes phycobilisomes are reduced and (phycobiliprotein 545 PE545 molecules here) are densely packed inside the lumen of thylakoides. 

Phycobiliproteins have many practical application to them including imperative properties like hepato-protective, anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging activity of PBPs enable their use in food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. PBPs have been also noted to show beneficial effect in therapeutics of some disease like Alzheimer and cancer.

Phycoerythrin is an accessory pigment to the main chlorophyll pigments responsible for photosynthesis. The light energy is captured by phycoerythrin and is then passed on to the reaction centre chlorophyll pair, most of the time via the phycobiliproteins phycocyanin and allophycocyanin.

==Structural characteristics==
Phycoerythrins except phycoerythrin 545 (PE545) are composed of (αβ) monomers assembled into disc-shaped (αβ)6 hexamers or (αβ)3 trimers with 32 or 3 symmetry and enclosing central channel. In phycobilisomes (PBS) each trimer or hexamer contains at least one linker protein located in central channel. B-phycoerythrin (B-PE) and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) from red algae in addition to α and β chains have a third, γ subunit contributing both linker and light-harvesting functions, because it bears chromophores. 

R-phycoerythrin is predominantly produced by red algae. The protein is made up of at least three different subunits and varies according to the species of algae that produces it. The subunit structure of the most common R-PE is (αβ)6γ. The α subunit has two phycoerythrobilins (PEB), the β subunit has 2 or 3 PEBs and one phycourobilin (PUB), while the different gamma subunits are reported to have 3 PEB and 2 PUB (γ1) or 1 or 2 PEB and 1 PUB (γ2). The molecular weight of R-PE is 250,000 daltons.

Crystal structures available in the Protein Data Bank contain in one (αβ)2 or (αβγ)2 asymmetric unit of different phycoerythrins:



The assumed biological molecule of phycoerythrin 545 (PE545) is (αβ)2 or rather . The numbers 2 and 3 after the α letters in second formula are part of chain names here, not their counts. The synonym cryptophytan name of α3 chain is α1 chain.

The largest assembly of B-phycoerythrin (B-PE) is (αβ)3 trimer . However, preparations from red algae yield also (αβ)6 hexamer . In case of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) the largest assumed biological molecule here is (αβγ)6, or (αβ)6 dependently on publication, for other phycoerythrin types (αβ)6. These γ chains from the Protein Data Bank are very small and consist only of three or six recognizable amino acids , whereas described at the beginning of this section linker γ chain is large (for example 277 amino acid long 33 kDa in case of γ33 from red algae &quot;Aglaothamnion neglectum&quot;) . This is because the electron density of the gamma-polypeptide is mostly averaged out by its threefold crystallographic symmetry and only a few amino acids can be modeled .

For (αβγ)6, (αβ)6 or the values from the table should be simply multiplied by 3, (αβ)3 contain intermediate numbers of non-protein molecules. (this non sequitur needs to be corrected)

In phycoerythrin PE545 above, one α chain (-2 or -3) binds one molecule of billin, in other examples it binds two molecules. The β chain always binds to three molecules. The small γ chain binds to none.

Two molecules of &quot;N&quot;-methyl asparagine are bound to the β chain, one 5-hydroxylysine to α (-3 or -2), one Mg2+ to α-3 and β, one Cl− to β, 1–2 molecules of to α or β.

Below is sample crystal structure of R-phycoerythrin from Protein Data Bank:

==Spectral characteristics==

Absorption peaks in the visible light spectrum are measured at 495 and 545/566 nm, depending on the chromophores bound and the considered organism. A strong emission peak exists at 575 ± 10 nm. (Phycoerythrin absorbs slightly blue-green/yellowish light and emits slightly orange-yellow light.)
PEB and DBV bilins in PE545 absorb in the green spectral region too, with maxima at 545 and 569 nm respectively. The fluorescence emission maximum is at 580 nm. 

==R-Phycoerythrin variations==

As mentioned above, phycoerythrin can be found in a variety of algal species. As such, there can be variation in the efficiency of absorbance and emission of light required for facilitation of photosynthesis. This could be a result of the depth in the water column that a specific alga typically resides and a consequent need for greater or less efficiency of the accessory pigments.

With advances in imaging and detection technology which can avoid rapid photobleaching, protein fluorophores have become a viable and powerful tool for researchers in fields such as microscopy, microarray analysis and Western blotting. In light of this, it may be beneficial for researchers to screen these variable R-phycoerythrins to determine which one is most appropriate for their particular application. Even a small increase in fluorescent efficiency could reduce background noise and lower the rate of false-negative results.

==Practical applications==
R-Phycoerythrin (also known as PE or R-PE) is useful in the laboratory as a fluorescence-based indicator for the presence of cyanobacteria and for labeling antibodies, most often for flow cytometry. Its also used in microarray assays, ELISAs, and other applications that require high sensitivity but not photostability. Its use is limited in immunofluorescence microscopy due to its rapid photobleaching characteristics. There are also other types of phycoerythrins, such as B-phycoerythrin, which have slightly different spectral properties. B-Phycoerythrin absorbs strongly at about 545 nm (slightly yellowish green) and emits strongly at 572 nm (yellow) instead and could be better suited for some instruments. B-Phycoerythrin may also be less &quot;sticky&quot; than R-phycoerythrin and contributes less to background signal due to nonspecific binding in certain applications. However, R-PE is much more commonly available as an antibody conjugate. Phycoerythrin (PE, λA max = 540–570 nm; λF max = 575–590 nm)

R-Phycoerythrin and B-phycoerythrin are among the brightest fluorescent dyes ever identified.

<doc id="698225" wikidata="Q919928" url="?curid=698225" title="Virgil Exner">
<text>Virgil Max &quot;Ex&quot; Exner Sr. (September 24, 1909 – December 22, 1973) was an automobile designer for several American automobile companies, most notably Chrysler and Studebaker.

Exner is widely known for the &quot;Forward Look&quot; he created for the 1955–1963 Chrysler products and his fondness of tailfins on cars for both aesthetics and aerodynamics.

Prior to the 1955 model year, Chrysler products were considered solid and well-engineered, but with dull styling. But for 1955 and 1956, Chrysler introduced the first set of cars with Exner&#x27;s stylish and popular Forward Look. These models were very popular and greatly improved Chrysler&#x27;s image.
For 1957, Chrysler launched all-new models again, introducing cars that were long, low, wide, and featured sweeping tailfins—designs that caused a sensation within the North American auto industry.

When GM designer Chuck Jordan peered through a fence—thanks to a tip he received—and spied Chrysler&#x27;s soon-to-be-launched 1957 Chrysler lineup, it prompted Bill Mitchell, Jordan&#x27;s boss at General Motors styling, to convince GM top executives and styling chief Harley Earl to re-open the already-completed designs for the 1959 models and create &quot;an alternate design for each car line, Chevrolet through Cadillac.&quot; Exner&#x27;s work effectively &quot;change[d] the course of automotive design&quot; during that period.

==Early life==
Born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Virgil Exner was adopted by George W. and Iva Exner as a baby. Virgil showed a strong interest in art and automobiles. He went to Buchanan High School in Buchanan, Michigan then studied art at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana but, in 1928, dropped out after two years due to lack of funds. He then took a job as a helper at an art studio specializing in advertising. In 1931 he married Mildred Marie Eshleman, who also worked for the studio and, on April 17, 1933, they had their first child, Virgil Exner Jr. By that time, Exner Sr. had been promoted to drawing advertisements for Studebaker trucks. They had a second son in 1940, Brian, who died of injuries after falling from a window. They had their first daughter June 28, 1943, Bronwen Marie Exner. Exner also adopted and raised his niece, Marie Exner, born in 1947, who had become an orphan after her mother Lenor (Milred&#x27;s sister) passed away when Marie was a young child.

==Design work==

===General Motors===
His first work in design was for General Motors, where he was hired by GM styling czar Harley Earl. Before age 30, he was in charge of Pontiac styling.

===Loewy and Associates===
In 1938, he joined Raymond Loewy&#x27;s industrial design firm Loewy and Associates, where he worked on World War II military vehicles and cars, notably Studebaker&#x27;s 1939–40 models, and advance plans for their revolutionary post-war cars. &quot;But working on Studebaker designs… Exner struggled to get the attention of his boss, who had to sign off on every facet of the designs. Exner was encouraged by Roy Cole, Studebaker&#x27;s engineering vice president, to work on his own at home on backup designs in case the company&#x27;s touchy relationship with Loewy blew up&quot;.

===Studebaker Corporation===

In 1944, he was fired by Loewy and was hired directly by Studebaker in South Bend, Indiana. There he was involved in the design of some of the first cars with all new styling to be produced after World War II (Studebaker&#x27;s slogan during this period was &quot;First by far with a post war car&quot;). As acknowledged by Robert Bourke, Virgil was the final designer of the acclaimed 1947 Studebaker Starlight coupe, though Raymond Loewy received the public acknowledgment because his legendary name was a major advertising attraction. Exner is actually listed as the sole inventor on the design patent. Rivalry and bad feeling between the two resulted in Exner having to leave Studebaker, whose engineering chief Roy Cole provided personal introductions for him to Ford and Chrysler.

===Chrysler Corporation===
In 1949, Exner started working in Chrysler&#x27;s Advanced Styling Group, where he partnered with Cliff Voss and Maury Baldwin. He also worked with Luigi &quot;Gigi&quot; Segre, of Italian coach builder Carrozzeria Ghia S.p.A. The men forged a strong personal bond, which helped link the companies closely throughout the 1950s. The alliance produced the Chrysler Ghia designs, such as the 1952 Chrysler K-310, the mid-1950s Dodge Firearrow series show cars, as well as the Chrysler d&#x27;Elegance and DeSoto Adventurer.

==== Forward Look design program ====
When Exner joined Chrysler, the company&#x27;s vehicles were being fashioned by engineers instead of designers, and so were considered outmoded, unstylish designs. 

After seeing the Lockheed P-38 Lightning-inspired tailfins on the 1948 Cadillac, Exner adopted fins as a central element of his vehicle designs. He believed in the aerodynamic benefits of the fins, and even used wind tunnel testing at the University of Michigan—but he also liked their visual effects on the car. Exner lowered the roofline and made the cars sleeker, smoother, and more aggressive looking. In 1955, Chrysler introduced &quot;The New 100-Million Dollar Look&quot;. With a long hood and short deck, the wedgelike designs of the Chrysler 300 letter series and revised 1957 models suddenly brought the company to the forefront of design, with Ford and General Motors quickly working to catch up. The 1957 Imperial also featured compound curved glass, the first to be used in a production car. The 1957 Plymouths were advertised with the slogan, &quot;Suddenly, it&#x27;s 1960!&quot; In June of that year, Exner and his team were awarded a Gold Medal Award by the Industrial Designers Institute (IDI). In 1958, Chrysler&#x27;s Forward Look was the sponsor of the groundbreaking &quot;An Evening with Fred Astaire&quot; TV special.


In 1956, during the design of the 1961 models, Exner suffered a heart attack. He resumed work in 1957, working on the designs for the 1962 cars. On July 25, 1957, Exner was elected the first vice president of styling at Chrysler. Unfortunately, a rumor that GM was reducing the size of their cars caused the president of Chrysler, Lester Lum (&quot;Tex&quot;) Colbert, to order Exner to do the same to his 1962 design–a change Exner disagreed with, thinking it would make his cars &quot;ugly&quot;. Exner with his associates had completed work on the second full-sized finless Plymouth since 1955, this one for 1962, described as a strikingly attractive automobile. While he was still recovering from the heart attack, the 1962 models Exner took credit for were downsized by associates. This downsizing drastically changed the cars&#x27; appearance. This reduced the cars&#x27; appeal and caused a significant drop in sales. It turned out that the Chevrolet rumor was false and consumers disliked the smaller Plymouth and Dodge cars introduced for 1962, the styling of which was bizarre compared to more sedate Ford and GM products. Needing a scapegoat, Chrysler fired Exner. He was allowed to retain a position as a consultant so he could retire with a pension at age 55. He was replaced by Elwood Engel, who had been lured from Ford. Engel was highly regarded for his design of the classic 1961 Lincoln Continental.

Tailfins soon lost popularity. By the late 1950s, Cadillac and Chrysler–driven by the respective competing visions of GM&#x27;s Earl and Chrysler&#x27;s Exner–had escalated the size of fins till some thought they were stylistically questionable and they became a symbol of American excess in the early 1960s. The 1961 models are considered the last of the &quot;Forward Look&quot; designs; Exner later referred to the finless 1962 downsized Plymouth and Dodge models as &quot;plucked chickens&quot;. He believed Chrysler executives had &quot;picked&quot; away at the cars to make them lower in cost.

Although fins were out of favor by the early 1960s, fins could still give aerodynamic advantages. In the early 1970s, Porsche 917 racing automobiles sported fins reminiscent of Exner&#x27;s designs.

===Volkswagen Karmann Ghia===
Three entities came together in the history of the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia—a design that ultimately reflected strong influence from Virgil Exner. In the early 1950s, Volkswagen was producing its Type 1 (Beetle). As post-war standards of living increased, executives at Volkswagen were at least receptive to adding a halo model to its range, if not proactive. Luigi Segre was committed to expanding the international reputation of Carrozzeria Ghia. And Wilhelm Karmann had taken over his family coachbuilding firm Karmann and was eager to augment his contracts building Volkswagen&#x27;s convertible models.

As the head of Ghia, Segre singularly directed and incubated the project through conception and prototyping, delivering a feasible project that Willhelm Karmann both wanted to and could practically build—the project Willhelm Karmann would in turn present to Volkswagen. The styling itself, however, integrated work by Segre as well as Mario Boano, Sergio Coggiola, and designer/engineer Giovanni Savonuzzi—and at various times they each took credit for the design. Furthermore, the design bore striking styling similarities to Virgil Exner&#x27;s Chrysler &quot;D&#x27;Elegance&quot; and K-310 concepts, which Ghia had been tasked with prototyping, and which in turn reflected numerous cues and themes developed previously by Mario Boano. The precise styling responsibilities were never documented before the passing of the designers, further complicated by the overlapping work of the key players. A definitive individual attribution on Karmann Ghia&#x27;s was never made.

Segre and Virgil Exner had become close professionally and personally, eventually traveling Europe together. Peter Grist wrote in a 2007 Exner biography that when Exner in 1955 eventually saw the Karmann Ghia, which cribbed heavily from his Chrysler D&#x27;Elegance, &quot;he was pleased with the outcome and glad that one of his designs had made it into large-scale production.&quot; Chris Voss, a stylist in Exner&#x27;s office, reported in 1993, that Exner considered the Karmann Ghia the ultimate form of flattery. Segre in turn sent Exner the first production Karmann Ghia imported into the state of Michigan, in gratitude.

After Volkswagen approved the design in November 1953, the Karmann Ghia debuted at the 1955 Paris Auto show and went into production, first at Ghia and then in Osnabrück — ultimately to reach a production over 445,000, running 19 years virtually unchanged.

==Retirement==
Exner continued consulting for many car companies from his office in Birmingham, Michigan. He also teamed up with his son, Virgil Exner Jr., designing watercraft for Buehler Corporation. In 1963, he designed a series of &quot;Revival Cars&quot; with production plans. His revival of Duesenberg failed, but he was instrumental in the revival of Stutz in the 1970s.

Seeking to reenter the automotive field, Exner drafted a resume, describing himself as having &quot;extensive, responsible and successful experience in all areas.&quot; Exner died of heart failure on December 22, 1973, at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan.

<doc id="698226" wikidata="Q830115" url="?curid=698226" title="Concept map">
<text>A concept map or conceptual diagram is a diagram that depicts suggested relationships between concepts. Concept maps may be used by instructional designers, engineers, technical writers, and others to organize and structure knowledge.

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows, often in a downward-branching hierarchical structure but also in maps. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in &quot;linking phrases&quot; such as &quot;causes&quot;, &quot;requires&quot;, &quot;such as&quot; or &quot;contributes to&quot;.

The technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called &quot;concept mapping&quot;. Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism.

== Differences from other visualizations ==

* &quot;Topic maps&quot;: Both concept maps and topic maps are kinds of knowledge graph, but topic maps were developed by information management professionals for semantic interoperability of data (originally for book indices), whereas concept maps were developed by education professionals to support people&#x27;s learning. In the words of concept-map researchers Joseph D. Novak and Bob Gowin, their approach to concept mapping is based on a &quot;learning theory that focuses on concept and propositional learning as the basis on which individuals construct their own idiosyncratic meanings&quot;.
* &quot;Mind maps&quot;: Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with mind mapping, which is restricted to a tree structure. Concept maps can be more free-form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which emerge from a single center.

== History ==
Concept mapping was developed by the professor of education Joseph D. Novak and his research team at Cornell University in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students. It has subsequently been used as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin in the learning movement called constructivism. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge.

Novak&#x27;s work is based on the cognitive theories of David Ausubel, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or &quot;assimilate&quot;) new concepts: &quot;The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.&quot; Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as &quot;What is water?&quot; &quot;What causes the seasons?&quot; In his book &quot;Learning How to Learn&quot;, Novak stated that a &quot;meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures.&quot;

Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. McAleese suggested that the process of making knowledge explicit, using &quot;nodes&quot; and &quot;relationships&quot;, allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know. Maria Birbili applied the same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know. McAleese&#x27;s concept of the knowledge arena suggests a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know.

==Use==
Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid creativity. Concept mapping is also sometimes used for brain-storming. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas.

Formalized concept maps are used in software design, where a common usage is Unified Modeling Language diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies.

Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in ontology-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument — similar to argument maps.

Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include:
*Note taking and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials
*New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming tacit knowledge into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge
*Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement
*Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge
*Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization
*Instructional design: concept maps used as Ausubelian &quot;advance organizers&quot; that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning.
*Training: concept maps used as Ausubelian &quot;advanced organizers&quot; to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization&#x27;s strategic objectives, to training goals.
*Communicating complex ideas and arguments
*Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology
*Detailing the entire structure of an idea, train of thought, or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one&#x27;s own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others.
*Enhancing metacognition (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge)
*Improving language ability
*Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts
*Lexicon development

<doc id="698233" wikidata="Q268644" url="?curid=698233" title="Midori (violinist)">
<text>, who performs under the mononym Midori, is a Japanese-born American violinist. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic at age 11 as a surprise guest soloist at the New Year&#x27;s Eve Gala in 1982. In 1986 her performance at the Tanglewood Music Festival with Leonard Bernstein conducting his own composition made the front-page headlines in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Midori became a celebrated child prodigy, and one of the world&#x27;s preeminent violinists as an adult.

Midori has been honored as an educator and for her community engagement endeavors. When she was 21, she established her foundation Midori and Friends to bring music education to young people in underserved communities in New York City and Japan, which has evolved into four distinct organizations with worldwide impact. In 2007, Midori was appointed as a UN Messenger of Peace. In 2018, she joined the violin faculty at the Curtis Institute of Music. She is also on the faculty of the University of Southern California&#x27;s Thornton School of Music serving as Distinguished Professor and Judge Widney Professor of Music. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012.

==Early life==
Midori was born Midori Goto in Osaka, Japan, on October 25, 1971. She dropped her father&#x27;s surname from her stage name after her parents’ divorce in 1983, initially performing under the name Mi Dori, then deciding on the single word Midori. Her father was a successful engineer and her mother, Setsu Gotō, was a professional violinist. Setsu regularly took young Midori to her orchestra rehearsals where the toddler slept in the front row of the auditorium while her mother rehearsed. One day Setsu heard a two-year-old Midori humming a Bach concerto that had been rehearsed two days earlier. Subsequently, Midori often tried to touch her mother&#x27;s violin, even climbing onto the bench of the family piano to try to reach the violin on top of the piano. On Midori&#x27;s third birthday, Setsu gave her a 1/16 size violin and began giving her lessons.

==Career==
Midori gave her first public performance at the age of six, playing one of the 24 Caprices of Paganini in her native Osaka. In 1982 she and her mother moved to New York City, where Midori started violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at Pre-College Division of Juilliard School and the Aspen Music Festival and School. As her audition piece, Midori performed Bach&#x27;s thirteen-minute-long Chaconne, generally considered one of the most difficult solo violin pieces. In the same year, she made her concert debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, a conductor with whom she would later record on the Sony Classical label. In 1986 came her legendary performance of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Serenade&quot; at Tanglewood, conducted by Bernstein. During the performance, she broke the E string on her violin, then again on the concertmaster&#x27;s Stradivarius after she borrowed it. She finished the performance with the associate concertmaster&#x27;s Guadagnini and received a standing ovation. The next day&#x27;s &quot;The New York Times&quot; front page carried the headline, &quot;Girl, 14, Conquers Tanglewood with 3 Violins&quot;.

When Midori was 15, she left Juilliard Pre-College in 1987 after four years and became a full-time professional violinist. In October 1989, she celebrated her 18th birthday with her Carnegie Hall orchestral debut, playing Bartok&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2. She made her Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1990 four days before her 19th birthday. Both performances were critically acclaimed. In 1990, she also graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School which she attended for academic subjects.

In 1992, she formed Midori and Friends, a non-profit organization that aims to bring music education to children in New York City and in Japan after learning of severe cutbacks to music education in U.S. schools. Her organization Music Sharing began as the Tokyo branch-office of Midori and Friends and was certified as an independent organization in 2002. Music Sharing focuses on education about Western classical music and traditional Japanese music for young people, including instrument instruction for the disabled. Its International Community Engagement Program is a training program for internationally chosen aspiring musicians that promotes cultural exchange and community engagement.

In 2000, Midori graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from the Gallatin School at New York University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Psychology and Gender Studies, completing the degree in five years while also continuing to perform in concerts. She later earned a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from NYU in 2005. Her master&#x27;s thesis was about pain research. In 2001, Midori had returned to the stage and took a teaching position at the Manhattan School of Music. In 2001, with the money Midori received from winning the Avery Fisher Prize, she established the Partners in Performance program focusing on classical music organizations in smaller communities. In 2004, Midori launched the Orchestra Residencies program in the U.S. for youth orchestras, which was expanded to include collaborations with orchestras outside the U.S. in 2010.

In 2004, Midori was named a professor at University of Southern California&#x27;s Thornton School of Music where she is holder of the Jascha Heifetz Chair. She became a full-time resident of Los Angeles in 2006 after a period of bicoastal commuting and was promoted to the chair of the Strings Department in 2007. In 2012 she was named distinguished professor at USC, elected to the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by Yale University. Midori was Humanitas Visiting Professor in Classical Music and Music Education at Oxford University 2013–2014. Midori joined the violin faculty of Philadelphia&#x27;s Curtis Institute in the 2018–2019 academic year and remains on the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music&#x27;s violin faculty as a Judge Widney Professor of Music.

==Accolades==
In addition to being named Artist of the Year by the Japanese government (1988) and the recipient of the 25th Suntory Music Award (1993), Midori has won the Avery Fisher Prize (2001), Musical America’s Instrumentalist of the Year award (2002), the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis (2002, 2003), the Kennedy Center Gold Medal in the Arts (2010), the Mellon Mentoring Award (2012). In 2007 Midori was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 2012, she received the prestigious Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum in Davos for &quot;20-year devotion to community engagement work worldwide&quot;. In May 2021 she was an honoree of the 43rd Kennedy Center Honors. In May 2022, Midori was awarded the John D. Rockefeller III Award by the Asian Cultural Council alongside artist Cai Guo-Qiang. The John D. Rockefeller 3rd Award is given to individuals from Asia or the U.S. who have made significant contributions to the international understanding, practice, or study of the visual or performing arts of Asia.

==Personal life==
In September 1994, Midori suddenly canceled her concerts and withdrew from public view. She was hospitalised and given an official diagnosis of anorexia for the first time. In her twenties, Midori struggled with anorexia and depression, resulting in a number of hospital stays. She later wrote about these personal difficulties in her 2004 memoir &quot;Einfach Midori&quot; (&quot;Simply Midori&quot;), which has been published in German but not English. (It was updated and reissued in German-speaking countries in 2012.) After recovering, she continued to perform and also studied psychology and gender studies at New York University. For a while, she considered psychology as an alternative career, with a focus on working with children.

Midori&#x27;s half-brother Ryu and her stepfather Makoto Kaneshiro (Ryu&#x27;s father, a former violin assistant of Dorothy DeLay) are both violinists.

Midori is a 2019 Honoree of the Great Immigrants Award by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

==Instrument==
Midori plays on the 1731 Guarneri &quot;ex-Huberman&quot; violin. Her bows are made by Dominique Peccatte (two) and François Peccatte (one).

<doc id="698238" wikidata="Q1052837" url="?curid=698238" title="Power Macintosh 7100">
<text>The Power Macintosh 7100 is a personal computer that was designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from March 1994 to January 1996. It is the mid-range machine of the first generation of Power Macintosh line, between the Power Macintosh 6100 and the 8100. The 7100 re-used the Macintosh IIvx case with few changes. The initial version of the 7100 was powered by a PowerPC 601, and an version replaced it in January 1995. 
The 7100 was succeeded in August 1995 by two new models, the Power Macintosh 7200 and the Power Macintosh 7500, though sales of the 7100 continued into early 1996.

==Models==
The 7100AV variants include a 2 MB VRAM card with S-Video in/out. The non-AV 7100s have a video card containing 1 MB VRAM which was expandable to 2 MB, and no S-Video in/out capability.

Apple did not release a &quot;DOS Compatible&quot; card for the 7100 as they had for some contemporary Macintosh Quadra models, opting instead to offer the 7100 bundled with the SoftWindows emulator at a price of $385. With an optional 256KB L2 cache card installed, MacWorld Magazine determined that the performance is comparable to 25 MHz Intel 80486SX.

Introduced March 14, 1994:
* Power Macintosh 7100/66: No L2 cache. US$2,650.
* Power Macintosh 7100/66AV: $3,450.

Introduced January 3, 1995:
* Power Macintosh 7100/80: 256KB L2 cache.
* Power Macintosh 7100/80AV

==Codename lawsuits==
The Power Macintosh 7100&#x27;s internal code name was &quot;&quot;Carl Sagan&quot;, one of the three &quot;fraud&quot; code names (Pilt Down Man, Cold Fusion, and Carl Sagan) referring to the PowerPC processor pretending to be a 68000. Though the project name was internal, it was revealed to the public in a 1993 issue of &quot;MacWeek&quot;. Sagan, worried that the public might interpret this as an endorsement which sullied his name, reportedly contacted Apple and threatened to sue unless they could prove the codename did not officially link to his intellectual property and identity. After they reportedly refused, he wrote a letter to the editor that appeared in a 1994 issue of &quot;MacWeek&quot;, seeking to inform their readers of the situation.

Following the letter, a rogue programmer at Apple renamed the project to &quot;&quot;BHA&quot; (for Butt-Head Astronomer). Sagan then sued Apple for libel over the new name, but since the new codename was a expression of opinion, not fact, he lost his case. Sagan continued pursuing lawsuits. When he sued Apple again, this time for the original use of his name, he lost this suit as well. Sagan and Apple, apparently not wishing to engage in a series of lawsuits over the issue, came to an out-of-court agreement in November 1995, leading to Apple making a statement of apology. The engineers on the project made a third and final name change from &quot;BHA&quot; to &quot;LAW&quot;, short for &quot;Lawyers are Wimps&quot;.

<text>Red Dragon is a 2002 psychological thriller film based on the 1981 novel by Thomas Harris. It was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Tally. A prequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), it is the third film of the &quot;Hannibal Lecter&quot; franchise. It is the last film of the series distributed by Universal Pictures and the last film to star Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. It is followed by a prequel, &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot; (2007) which depicts Lecter&#x27;s youth. The film sees FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) enlisting the help of serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to catch another killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes). Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Philip Seymour Hoffman also star.

It is considered the fourth of the five released films regarding Hannibal Lecter. The novel was previously adapted into the film &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986). Both films feature the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti. After turning down the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; sequel, &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2001), &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; screenwriter Ted Tally returned to write &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. It was released on October 4, 2002 to generally positive reviews from critics, who deemed it to be an improvement over &quot;Hannibal&quot;, but inferior to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;. It was a box office success, earning $209 million worldwide against a $78 million budget.

An origin story, titled &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot;, was released in 2007.

== Plot ==
In 1980, FBI agent Will Graham visits forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter to discuss a case. Graham has been working with Lecter on a psychological profile of a serial killer; Graham is certain the killer is a cannibal, based on the fact that organs taken from the victims are often used in cooking. He then discovers a bookmarked sweetbreads recipe in Lecter&#x27;s study that includes those organs, revealing Lecter as the killer. Lecter stabs him, but Graham stabs him back with arrowheads and shoots him before falling unconscious. Lecter is tried, found not guilty by reason of insanity, and imprisoned in an institution for the criminally insane. Graham, traumatized, retires to Florida with his family.

Several years later, another serial killer nicknamed the &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; has murdered two families in different cities,the Jacobis and the Leedsesduring full moons. With another full moon approaching, special agent Jack Crawford persuades Graham to review evidence and provide leads. Graham decides to consult Lecter for further insight after telling Crawford that the Tooth Fairy has &quot;no face&quot; to him, and he cannot determine how he was choosing the victim families.
The Tooth Fairy is Francis Dolarhyde, who kills as directed by his alternate personality, which he calls the Great Red Dragon, after the William Blake painting &quot;The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun&quot;, which is tattooed on his back. He believes that each victim brings him closer to becoming the Dragon. His psychopathology originates from childhood abuse by his grandmother.

A letter from the Tooth Fairy, written on toilet paper, is discovered in Lecter&#x27;s cell, expressing admiration for Lecter and suggesting that Lecter reply through the personals section of the &quot;National Tattler&quot;. Lloyd Bowman deciphers Lecter&#x27;s reply, which is Will Graham&#x27;s home address, sending his family into hiding. To lure out the Tooth Fairy, Graham gives an interview to Freddy Lounds, a &quot;National Tattler&quot; reporter, disparaging the killer as an impotent homosexual and that Lecter was only feigning interest in him. Enraged, Dolarhyde kidnaps Lounds, glues him to a wheelchair, forces him to recant his allegations on tape, and sets him on fire, killing him.

At his job at Chromalux, a St. Louis based home video conversion business, Dolarhyde reluctantly begins a relationship with blind co-worker Reba McClane. He struggles with genuine affection for her and his alter ego&#x27;s demands that he kill her. Desperate to stop the Dragon&#x27;s control over him, Dolarhyde goes to the Brooklyn Museum, tears apart the Blake painting, and eats it. Graham realizes that the Tooth Fairy knew the layout of his victims&#x27; houses from their home videos and concludes that the killer must be a Chromalux employee. He immediately goes there and is spotted by Dolarhyde. Panicked, Dolarhyde goes to Reba&#x27;s house, suspecting that she may have betrayed him. He kills co-worker Ralph Mandy, takes a drugged Reba to his house, and sets it ablaze. Unable to kill her, he apparently shoots himself and Reba escapes. Graham is able to read Dolarhyde&#x27;s journal and realizes he was made into a monster by systematic abuse.

After an autopsy, it is revealed that Dolarhyde used Ralph&#x27;s body to stage his own death. Dolarhyde infiltrates the Graham home in Florida and takes Will&#x27;s son Josh hostage. To save Josh, Graham provokes Dolarhyde with his grandmother&#x27;s abusive words and he attacks him. Both are wounded in a shootout, which ends when Will&#x27;s wife Molly finally kills Dolarhyde.

Graham, now on a sailboat with Molly and Josh, receives a letter from Lecter praising his work and bidding him well. Lecter&#x27;s jailer, Dr. Frederick Chilton, tells him that he has a visitor, a young woman from the FBI.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
The 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, was a critical and commercial success, winning five Academy Awards. Hopkins was the only major member of the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; team to return for the 2001 sequel, &quot;Hannibal&quot;; it was also a commercial success, but received less positive reviews. Both films were adapted from novels by Thomas Harris.

Husband-and-wife producers Dino and Martha De Laurentiis decided to produce a film based on the 1981 novel &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; the first Hannibal Lecter novel, as a prequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; Dino said that people thought he was &quot;crazy&quot; for adapting the book, as it had been previously adapted as &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), with Brian Cox as Lecter. Both &quot;Manhunter&quot; and &quot;Red Dragon&quot; had the same cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, and both featured Frankie Faison.

Hopkins hesitated to sign on, worried that three Lecter films might be too much. Screenwriter Ted Tally, who wrote &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; but not &quot;Hannibal&quot;, had turned down many offers to write more serial killer stories. He said he liked the idea of Hopkins&#x27; Lecter films forming a trilogy: &quot;If it ends here, it will end gracefully. I would hate to see this become &quot;Hannibal Lecter XIII&quot;.&quot; To satisfy expectations, Tally added Lecter scenes not in the novel, describing it as a &quot;commercial reality&quot;. He had the support of Harris, who sent Tally dialogue and ideas for scenes. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes admired &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; but had not enjoyed &quot;Hannibal.&quot; The cast were persuaded to join by Tally&#x27;s screenplay; Fiennes felt it worked &quot;only on suspense&quot;, without overt violence.

Norton and Brett Ratner disagreed on the scene in which Graham approaches the incarcerated Lecter for the first time. Ratner wanted Norton to incorporate a gesture or look to indicate Graham&#x27;s fear, but Norton felt the audience would not need this if it were filmed correctly. They compromised by showing Graham&#x27;s sweat stains when he removes his jacket in the next scene. Whereas Fiennes wanted to avoid overplaying his serial killer character, Hopkins aimed to play Lecter with more &quot;danger and rage&quot; than before. Fiennes spent 90 minutes of each day for months building his physique, and wore a prosthetic to give him a cleft palate. The tattoo on his back took around eight hours to apply.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Red Dragon&quot; has an approval rating of 69% based on 191 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus said the film is &quot;competently made, but everything is a bit too familiar&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; gave the film a positive review, stating: &quot;This darkly seductive, flawlessly acted piece is worlds removed from most horror films. Here monsters have their grandeur, heroes their gravity. And when they collide, a dance of death ensues between two souls doomed to understand each other.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a positive review, saying that the &quot;audiences will be excused for any feelings of déjà vu the new film might inspire. That won&#x27;t prevent them from watching it in rapt, anxious silence, however, as the gruesome crimes, twisted psychology and deterministic dread that lie at the heart of Harris&#x27; work are laid out with care and skill.&quot;

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 out of four, praising Brett Ratner&#x27;s directing and the film&#x27;s atmosphere. He stated: &quot;To my surprise, Ratner does a sure, stylish job, appreciating the droll humor of Lecter&#x27;s predicament, creating a depraved new villain in the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), and using the quiet, intense skills of Norton to create a character whose old fears feed into his new ones. There is also humor, of the uneasy he-can&#x27;t-get-away-with-this variety, in the character of a nosy scandal-sheet reporter (Philip Seymour Hoffman).&quot; David Sterritt of the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave the film a positive review, stated that &quot;the most refreshing aspect of &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is its reliance on old-fashioned acting instead of computer-aided gizmos. Hopkins overdoes his role at times—his vocal tones are almost campy—but his piercing eyes are as menacing as ever, and Ralph Fiennes is scarily good as his fellow lunatic.&quot;

David Grove of &quot;Film Threat&quot;, who gave the film four stars out of five, said: &quot;Is &quot;Red Dragon&quot; a better film than &quot;Manhunter&quot;? I don&#x27;t know. I think it stands on its own, but I wonder how much people who are intimately familiar with &quot;Manhunter&quot; will be shocked by it, although the ending is altogether different and much more realized, I think&quot;. Rick Kisonak, who also wrote for &quot;Film Threat&quot;, also gave the film a positive review, but he gave it three stars out of five, saying: &quot;The only downside to this delectable third course? The regrettable likelihood that Lecter fans will have to make do without dessert.&quot;

Edward Guthmann of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, gave the film a mixed review, saying that &quot;in Hollywood, where integrity is rapidly consumed and careers defined by market value, there&#x27;s trash and there&#x27;s trash with a pedigree.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek, for &quot;Salon&quot;, also gave the film a mixed review, stating: &quot;If you buy the overprocessed headcheese of the serial killer as refined genius, you&#x27;ll love &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. Or maybe not. Even Hannibal Lecter devotees may lose patience with this picture&#x27;s grandiose, self-serious ponderousness—that&#x27;s Lecterese for, &#x27;It&#x27;s kind of boring in patches, actually.&#x27;&quot; William Arnold of &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer,&quot; who gave the film a mixed review, said that the film &quot;basically lives up to the old adage that the final work in a trilogy is invariably the weakest.&quot; Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the film a negative review; he stated: &quot;&quot;Red Dragon&quot;″s formula is so risible and rote by now that the natural reaction to scenes of peril, torture, and suffering is flippant laughter.&quot;

==Home media==

<text>Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT; ) is an independent worldwide cultural Esperanto association of a general far left-wing orientation. Its headquarters are in Paris. According to Jacques Schram, chairman of the Executive Committee, the membership totalled 881 in 2003. In 2006 SAT had 724 members. In 2015-2016 there were 525.

SAT uses Esperanto as its working language and aims through the use of Esperanto to enable progressive individuals, organizations and workers of all countries to exchange ideas and meet on the basis of equality across national barriers. Members of SAT are involved in socialist, anarchist, peace, trade union, anti-nationalist, feminist and environmental activities, among others.

==History==

SAT was founded in 1921 by Eugène Lanti (pseudonym of Eugène Adam) and others as an organisation of the workers&#x27; Esperanto movement. It was the largest and most active between the two World Wars. At its high point in 1929-1930 it had 6524 members in 1674 communities in 42 countries. It suffered heavy attrition soon after, however, when &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; activities, a category into which Esperanto fell, began to be persecuted in the Soviet Union after the onset of Stalinism, and after the ban on the workers&#x27; Esperanto movement in Germany that took effect immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933. The Soviet Union and Germany had been the countries in which SAT had the greatest number of members. Ideologically motivated internal schisms, involving at various times anarchists, communists and social democrats, also took a toll.

==Aims==

The following declaration of aims became part of the Statute at the foundation of SAT in 1921, and remains valid to this day:

&quot;a) to utilise the international language Esperanto for the class aims of the worldwide working class; b) to promote mutual relations among members in the best and most worthy way possible, in order to instill in them a strong sense of human solidarity; c) to instruct, educate and enlighten the members in such a way as to make them the most capable and best of the so-called internationalists; d) to serve as an intermediary in relations among organisations using other languages but having aims analogous to those of SAT; e) to be an intermediary and supporter in the creation of an Esperanto literature consisting both of translations and original texts, and which reflects the ideal of our association.&quot;

In 1928 it was further clarified in the following addendum:

&quot;SAT, an educational and cultural organisation rather than an overtly political one, tries to induce its members to be understanding and tolerant of the political and philosophical schools or systems that lie at the base of the various workers&#x27; parties that are oriented toward class struggle and of trade-union movements; it seeks, by means of comparison of facts and ideas and by means of free discussion, to enable its members to avoid the dogmatisation of the teachings they encounter in their particular milieus. In short, SAT constantly applies a rationally elaborated language on a worldwide scale in order to aid in the creation of intellects that think rationally and are able to compare accurately, understand correctly and assess ideas, theses and tendencies in such a way as to render them capable of electing independently the path they believe most direct or most expedient to the end of liberating their class and guiding the human race towards a level of civilisation and culture that is as advanced as possible.&quot;

SAT does not exist primarily to promote Esperanto – although it has a department that engages in such activity – but rather puts Esperanto to use for its political and educational purposes. Esperanto is promoted by separate regional organisations that are linked to SAT by contract. Most of these organisations are not national in scope, but encompass the territory of a particular language. The largest such organisation is SAT-Amikaro, which encompasses all French-speaking territories.

==Structure==

SAT has a non-national structure that deliberately avoids taking national differences into account. Its members join individually, not through the intermediary of a national section. The Universal Esperanto Association was structured in the same way when it was founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Hector Hodler. As for SAT, it was laid out by Eugène Lanti in a series of articles that appeared prior to the foundation of the Association in 1921.

The decision-making structure of SAT is, in theory, close to the organisational base, to the extent that all congress decisions should become valid only after a referendum. This statutory provision is intended to foment grass-roots democracy. In practice, many congress decisions are never submitted to a referendum. The association is governed by an eight-member Executive Committee, currently headed by Vinko Markov.

== Affiliated organizations ==

=== SATEB ===
&quot;SATEB&quot; (Workers’ Esperanto Movement) is the British affiliate of the SAT. It organizes an annual residential weekend at the Wedgwood Memorial College, Barlaston, Stoke-on-Trent. The main feature of these meetings is the visit of Esperanto-speaking lecturers from abroad (e.g. from Cuba, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries).

Members of SATEB receive the bilingual quarterly magazine &quot;La Verda Proleto&quot;.

==== Proposed suspension ====
At the 2007 annual meeting of SATEB—which seven people attended, including the guest speaker—the committee proposed a motion to suspend activity of SATEB until there emerged sufficient people to perform its essential roles. However, after debate it was decided to continue at a minimal level of activity.

==Activity==

SAT publishes the monthly magazine &quot;Sennaciulo&quot; [&quot;The Non-National&quot;] and the annual cultural review &quot;Sennacieca Revuo&quot;. SAT&#x27;s publishing cooperative also produces a variety of books, some of them of an educational nature, such as the &quot;Plena Ilustrita Vortaro&quot;, the most comprehensive Esperanto dictionary, as well as socially engaged literary works. It has recently begun to publish educational and political matter on the Internet.

It organises an annual international congress, which deals with both the affairs of the association and matters of general political concern.

<doc id="698259" wikidata="Q78509" url="?curid=698259" title="Joseph Roth">
<text>Moses Joseph Roth (2 September 1894 – 27 May 1939) was an Austrian-Jewish journalist and novelist, best known for his family saga &quot;Radetzky March&quot; (1932), about the decline and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, his novel of Jewish life &quot;Job&quot; (1930) and his seminal essay &quot;Juden auf Wanderschaft&quot; (1927; translated into English as &quot;The Wandering Jews&quot;), a fragmented account of the Jewish migrations from eastern to western Europe in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution. In the 21st century, publications in English of &quot;Radetzky March&quot; and of collections of his journalism from Berlin and Paris created a revival of interest in Roth.

==Biography==

Joseph Roth was born into a Jewish family and grew up in Brody (currently in Ukraine), a small town near Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine) in East Galicia, in the easternmost reaches of what was then the Austro-Hungarian empire. Jewish culture played an important role in the life of the town, which had a large Jewish population. Roth grew up with his mother and her relatives; he never saw his father, who had disappeared before he was born.

After secondary school, Joseph Roth moved to Lemberg to begin his university studies in 1913, before transferring to the University of Vienna in 1914 to study philosophy and German literature. In 1916, Roth broke off his university studies and volunteered to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front, &quot;though possibly only as an army journalist or censor&quot;. This experience had a major and long-lasting influence on his life. So, too, did the collapse in 1918 of the Habsburg Empire, which marked the beginning of a pronounced sense of &quot;homelessness&quot; that was to feature regularly in his work. As he wrote: &quot;My strongest experience was the War and the destruction of my fatherland, the only one I ever had, the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.&quot;

Roth married Friederike (Friedl) Reichler in 1922. In the late 1920s, his wife became schizophrenic, which threw Roth into a deep crisis, both emotionally and financially. She lived for years in a sanatorium and was later murdered in the Nazis&#x27; Aktion T4 programme.

In 1929 he met Andrea Manga Bell, born in Hamburg and unhappily married to Alexandre Douala Manga Bell, Prince of Douala in Cameroon. Her husband had returned to Cameroon while she and their children stayed in Europe. When Roth met her, she was editor of the Ullstein magazine &quot;Gebrauchsgraphik&quot;.
Being a prominent liberal Jewish journalist, Roth left Germany when Adolf Hitler became Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Andrea Manga Bell accompanied him with her children. He spent most of the next six years in Paris, a city he loved. His essays written in France display a delight in the city and its culture.

Shortly after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, in February 1933, Roth wrote in a prophetic letter to his friend, the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig:

The relationship with Andrea Manga Bell failed due to financial problems and Roth&#x27;s jealousy. From 1936 to 1938, Roth had a romantic relationship with Irmgard Keun. They worked together, traveling to Paris, Wilna, Lemberg, Warsaw, Vienna, Salzburg, Brussels and Amsterdam.

Without denying his Jewish origins, Roth considered his relationship to Catholicism very important. In the final years of his life, he may have converted: Michael Hofmann states in the preface to the collection of essays &quot; The White Cities&quot; (also published as &quot;Report from a Parisian Paradise&quot;) that Roth &quot;was said to have had two funerals, one Jewish, one Catholic&quot;.

In his last years, he moved from hotel to hotel, drinking heavily and becoming increasingly anxious about money and the future. Despite suffering from chronic alcoholism, he remained prolific until his death in Paris in 1939. His novella &quot;The Legend of the Holy Drinker&quot; (1939) chronicles the attempts made by an alcoholic vagrant to regain his dignity and honor a debt.

Roth&#x27;s final collapse apparently was precipitated by learning that playwright Ernst Toller had hanged himself in New York on May 22. Roth died on May 27 from double pneumonia, aggravated by abrupt withdrawal of alcohol that produced &quot;delirium tremens&quot;, and was buried on May 30 at the Cimetière de Thiais south of Paris.

==Journalism and literary career==
In 1918, Roth returned to Vienna and began writing for left-wing newspapers, signing articles published by &quot;Vorwärts&quot; as &quot;Der rote Joseph&quot; (&quot;The red Joseph&quot;, a play on his surname, which is homophonous with German &quot;rot&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, which is also the signalling color of communist parties in Europe). In 1920 he moved to Berlin, where he worked as a successful journalist for the &quot;&quot; and, from 1921, for the &quot;Berliner Börsen-Courier&quot;. In 1923 he began his association with the liberal &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, traveling widely throughout Europe, and reporting from the South of France, the USSR, Albania, Poland, Italy, and Germany. According to his main English translator, Michael Hofmann, &quot;He was one of the most distinguished and best-paid journalists of the period, being paid at the dream rate of one Deutschmark per line.&quot; In 1925 he spent a period working in France. He never again resided permanently in Berlin.
Roth has been referred to as one of the novelists who helped the emergence of what is nowadays called the Habsburg myth.

In 1923, Roth&#x27;s first (unfinished) novel, &quot;The Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, was serialized in an Austrian newspaper. He went on to achieve moderate success as a novelist with a series of books exploring life in post-war Europe, but only upon publication of &quot;Job&quot; and &quot;Radetzky March&quot; did he achieve acclaim for his fiction rather than his journalism.

From 1930, Roth&#x27;s fiction became less concerned with contemporary society, with which he had become increasingly disillusioned, and began to evoke a melancholic nostalgia for life in imperial Central Europe before 1914. He often portrayed the fate of homeless wanderers looking for a place to live, in particular Jews and former citizens of the old Austria-Hungary, who, with the downfall of the monarchy, had lost their only possible &quot;Heimat&quot; (&quot;true home&quot;). In his later works, Roth appeared to wish that the monarchy could be restored. His longing for a more tolerant past may be partly explained as a reaction against the political extremism of the time, which culminated in Germany with National Socialism. The novel &quot;Radetzky March&quot; (1932) and the story &quot;The Bust of the Emperor&quot; (1935) are typical of this late phase. In another novel, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1938), Roth describes the fate of a cousin of the hero of &quot;Radetzky March&quot; up to Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in 1938.

<doc id="698273" wikidata="Q52580" url="?curid=698273" title="Eugène Lanti">
<text>Eugène Lanti was a pseudonym of Eugène Aristide Alfred Adam (19 July 1879 in Normandy, France – 17 January 1947 in Mexico), an Esperantist, socialist and writer. He was a founder of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda, and a longtime editor of the internationalist socialist magazine &quot;Sennaciulo&quot;. Lanti was a critic of Stalinism and the theoretician of a new doctrine, anationalism, which aimed to eliminate the very concept of the nation as a guiding idea of social organisation.

== Biography ==
Lanti&#x27;s parents were peasant farmers. In his early life he worked as an agricultural labourer, carpenter, furniture maker and designer. He was self-educated, and studied in the evening. In 1914 he was mobilised in the First World War and served as an ambulance driver. He learnt Esperanto in 1914–15 at the Western Front, but in 1919 was almost persuaded to abandon Esperanto in favour of Ido. Following the war, he returned to Paris, became acquainted with Lucian Banmer and Ludoviko Glodeau, and he reaffirmed his support for Esperanto with his editorship of &quot;Liberiga Stelo&quot;.

In the 1920s Lanti lived in Paris with Ellen Kate Limouzin, the aunt of George Orwell. Orwell visited the couple and suffered as a non-speaker of Esperanto, and developed a strong dislike for the language. It has been suggested that Orwell included elements of Esperanto in the &quot;Newspeak&quot; language he created in his anti-totalitarian novel, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

== Lanti&#x27;s political career ==
In his youth Lanti had been attracted to anarchism, but in 1920 he abandoned anarchism and became a founding member of the French Communist Party. In 1921 in Prague he was the initiator and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT), a broad-based Esperanto-speaking organisation (containing Communists, Social Democrats and anarchists) which does not organise along national lines.

In 1933 Lanti, wounded by personal attacks and criticisms of his leadership, left his position of president of the Central Committee of SAT, a position he had occupied since the foundation of the organization. He continued, however, to play a role in the organisation chiefly as a writer. In 1935 Lanti founded the independent magazine &quot;Herezulo&quot; in which he criticised the Soviet regime more forcefully than in Sennaciulo.

== Lanti as lexicographer ==
Lanti was self-taught both in his use of literary French and Esperanto. He worked with &quot;Petit Larousse&quot;, and sought to create an Esperanto dictionary of the same type. He was centrally involved in the project run by SAT for the writing and design of the &quot;Plena Vortaro&quot; which later became today&#x27;s &quot;Plena Ilustrita Vortaro&quot;.

==Later years==

After his retirement in 1937, to meet Esperantists, Lanti left France for good and travelled to Spain, Portugal, North Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South America. Suffering from an incurable illness, he hanged himself in his flat in Mexico on 17 January 1947.

<text>An underground film is a film that is out of the mainstream either in its style, genre or financing.

Notable examples include
John Waters&#x27; &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;,
David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, 
Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Blue Movie&quot;,
Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s &quot;Tally Brown, New York&quot;,
Frank Henenlotter&#x27;s &quot;Basket Case&quot;,
Nikos Nikolaidis&#x27; &quot;Singapore Sling&quot;, 
Rinse Dreams&#x27; &quot;Café Flesh&quot;, and
Jörg Buttgereit&#x27;s &quot;Nekromantik&quot;.

==Definition and history==
The first printed use of the term &quot;underground film&quot; occurs in a 1957 essay by American film critic Manny Farber, &quot;Underground Films.&quot; Farber uses it to refer to the work of directors who &quot;played an anti-art role in Hollywood.&quot; He contrasts &quot;such soldier-cowboy-gangster directors as Raoul Walsh, Howard Hawks, William Wellman,&quot; and others with the &quot;less talented De Sicas and Zinnemanns [who] continue to fascinate the critics.&quot; However, as in &quot;Underground Press&quot;, the term developed as a metaphorical reference to a clandestine and subversive culture beneath the legitimate and official media.

In the late 1950s, &quot;underground film&quot; began to be used to describe early independent film makers operating first in San Francisco, California and New York City, New York, and soon in other cities around the world as well, including the London Film-Makers&#x27; Co-op in Britain and Ubu Films in Sydney, Australia. The movement was typified by more experimental filmmakers working at the time like Shirley Clarke, Stan Brakhage, Harry Everett Smith, Maya Deren, Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, Ron Rice, Jack Smith, George and Mike Kuchar, and Bruce Conner.

By the late 1960s, the movement represented by these filmmakers had matured, and some began to distance themselves from the countercultural, psychedelic connotations of the word, preferring terms like &quot;avant-garde&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; to describe their work.

Having been embraced most emphatically by Nick Zedd and the other filmmakers associated with the New York–based Cinema of Transgression and No Wave Cinema of the late 1970s to early 1990s, the term would still be used to refer to the more countercultural fringe of independent cinema.

==Latter-day cinema==
In the early 1990s, the legacy of the Cinema of Transgression carried over into a new generation, who would equate &quot;underground cinema&quot; with transgressive art, ultra-low-budget filmmaking created in defiance of both the commercialized versions of independent film offered by newly wealthy distributors like Miramax and New Line, as well as the institutionalized experimental film canonized at major museums. This spirit defined the early years of underground film festivals (like the New York Underground Film Festival, Chicago Underground Film Festival, Boston Underground Film Festival, Sydney Underground Film Festival, Hamilton Underground Film Festival, Toronto&#x27;s Images Festival, and others), zines like Film Threat, as well as the works of filmmakers like Craig Baldwin, Jon Moritsugu, Carlos Atanes, Sarah Jacobson, and Bruce La Bruce. In London, the Underground resurgence emerged as a movement of Underground cinema clubs which included the radical open access group the Exploding Cinema.

By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term had become blurred again, as the work at underground festivals began to blend with more formal experimentation, and the divisions that had been stark ones less than a decade earlier now seemed much less so. If the term is used at all, it connotes a form of very low-budget independent filmmaking, with perhaps transgressive content, or a lo-fi analog to post-punk music and cultures.

A recent development in underground filmmaking can be observed through the Lower East Side–based film production company ASS Studios. Founded in 2011 by writer Reverend Jen and filmmaker Courtney Fathom Sell, the group avoided most modern methods of production, choosing to shoot all of their work on an outdated Hi8 format and usually with no budget. Utilizing many New York based performers, their work generally contained camp elements and taboo themes. These films were commonly screened at venues and bars in and around New York City.

==Underground versus cult==
The term &quot;underground film&quot; is occasionally used as a synonym for cult film (as in the case of films like &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;). Though there are important distinctions between the two, a significant overlap between these categories is undeniable. The films of Kenneth Anger, for example, could arguably be described as underground while a studio film like &quot;Heathers&quot; (New World Pictures) may have a cult following but could not be accurately described as an underground film.

==Criticism==
Film critic Pauline Kael called most underground cinema &quot;a creature of publicity and mutual congratulations on artistry&quot;.

<text>Ros Serey Sothea (/ ; ) was a Cambodian singer. She was the first prominent female artist in the Cambodian rock scene during the final years of the First Kingdom of Cambodia and into the Khmer Republic period. She sang in a variety of genres; romantic ballads emerged as her most popular works. Despite a relatively brief career she is credited with singing hundreds of songs. She also ventured into acting, starring in a few films. Details of her life are relatively scarce. She disappeared during the Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s but the circumstances of her fate remain a mystery. Norodom Sihanouk granted Sothea the honorary title &quot;Queen with the Golden Voice.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ros Sothea was born in circa 1948 to Ros Bun () and Nath Samien () in Battambang province, French protectorate of Cambodia. Growing up relatively poor on a farm, Ros Sothea was the second youngest of five children; her older sister Ros Saboeut later became known as an activist. She displayed vocal talent as a toddler and grew up listening to early Cambodian pop singers like Mao Sareth and Chhoun Malay. Sothea&#x27;s talent would remain relatively hidden until friends persuaded her to join a regional singing contest in 1963. After winning the contest she became widely known in her home province and was invited to join a musical troupe that regularly performed at Stung Khiev restaurant in Battambang; she also performed in a family band with her brother Serey. It is believed that Im Song Seurm, a singer from the National Radio service, heard of Sothea&#x27;s talents and invited her to Phnom Penh in 1967.

===Music career===

In Phnom Penh, she adopted the alias Ros Serey Sothea and became a singer for the National Radio service, first performing duets with Im Song Soeum. Her first hit, &quot;Stung Khieu (Blue River)&quot; appeared in 1967 and she quickly became popular across Cambodia, particularly for her high and clear voice. Eventually she became a regular partner with Sinn Sisamouth, the era&#x27;s leading singer, resulting in many popular duet recordings. She also collaborated with other prominent singers of the era like Pen Ran, Huoy Meas, and Sos Mat, while maintaining an active solo career as well.

Sothea&#x27;s early recordings were largely traditional Cambodian ballads. She would eventually adopt a more contemporary style incorporating French and American influences, adding western pop/rock instrumentation, as was common in Cambodian music starting in the late 1960s. Eventually Sothea and her contemporaries were strongly influenced by American radio that had been transmitted to U.S. troops in nearby South Vietnam, inspiring experimentation with American and British rock and soul sounds. Sothea combined her high and clear voice with backing provided by young rock musicians, characterized by prominent electric guitars, drums, and Farfisa organs. This resulted in a sound that is often described as psychedelic or garage rock, and Sothea became the leading female singer in the thriving Cambodian rock scene. Sothea was also one of many singers in that scene to create new versions of popular western rock songs with Khmer lyrics, such as &quot;Cry Loving Me&quot; (based on &quot;Proud Mary&quot; by Creedence Clearwater Revival) and &quot;Wolly Polly&quot; (based on &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; by Sam the Sham).

Romantic ballads would remain her most endearing work amongst the more conservative populace. She was often sought out by film directors to perform songs in their movies. Sothea&#x27;s collaboration with the Cambodian film industry is invaluable in identifying over 250 films lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Sothea never sang under any one record label and made a modest living as a musician. She was recognized as a national treasure and was honored by Head of State Norodom Sihanouk with the royal title of &quot;Preah Reich Theany Somlang Meas&quot;, the &quot;Queen with the Golden Voice&quot; (sometimes translated as &quot;Golden Voice of the Royal Capital&quot;). During the Cambodian Civil War in the early 1970s, Sothea became involved in the Khmer Republic military and recorded patriotic songs supporting the Republic&#x27;s stance against the Khmer Rouge insurgents. Her career would continue until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in April 1975.

===Personal life===

Little information about Ros Serey Sothea&#x27;s personal life has survived, though her personality has been described as modest and reserved. She is known to have been involved in a few high-profile relationships. As documented in the film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot;, when she arrived in Phnom Penh she was courted by fellow singer Sos Mat and they eventually married. As Sothea&#x27;s career moved forward, Sos Mat became jealous of her success and of the men who came to watch her perform, culminating in physical abuse. Sothea fled the marriage within six months and obtained a divorce. Believing that her career would be ruined by the stigma of divorce, Sothea went back to her family in Battambang but was convinced by Sinn Sisamouth to return to Phnom Penh and resume her career.

Sothea&#x27;s popularity rebounded and she met a prominent member of a film-making family while recording film songs. This relationship led to marriage and the birth of a son, but for undocumented reasons the marriage was short-lived. The film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot; also reports that Sothea had a relationship with an officer in the Khmer Republic army and learned to be a paratrooper during the Cambodian Civil War, though her boyfriend is believed to have been killed in combat. This relationship increased her participation with the military; a film of Sothea parachuting out of a plane during a paratrooper exercise is the only known video footage of her to have survived. Fans believe that Sothea&#x27;s unhappy relationships were a primary influence on her singing style and lyrics, indicated by song titles (in translation) like &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Mad,&quot; &quot;Brokenhearted Woman,&quot; and &quot;Wicked Husband.&quot;

===Disappearance and death===
Ros Serey Sothea disappeared and perished during the Khmer Rouge genocide, although her exact fate has never been confirmed. 

Her sisters have alleged that Sothea is likely to have died immediately after the Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia in April 1975; as a famous entertainer with &quot;western&quot; influences, qualities widely known to be disdained by the Khmer Rouge, she would have been targeted for imprisonment or execution immediately. Her whereabouts at the time are also uncertain, with some sources claiming that she had traveled to Pailin Province for the 1975 Buddhist New Year, as the lyrics of her final recordings are on that topic, although others are skeptical of this claim because of the dangers of traveling in Cambodia during that period. She may have also been in Phnom Penh at the time and was forced to evacuate like all other residents, and some sources also claim that the outgoing government made efforts to get her out of the country.

Other theories suggest Sothea, like most city dwellers, was likely relocated to the Cambodian countryside and was worked to death in forced labour in agricultural fields in Kampong Speu province. Having grown up on a farm, she was able to adjust to the work and conceal her identity for a time. According to testimonies from survivors who claimed to have known her at the time, she was eventually discovered, after which her husband was murdered and she was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge officer and perform communist songs regularly for the party leadership. This story contends that her marriage to the officer was abusive and the party leadership determined that her presence was too controversial, so she was allegedly led away and executed in 1977.

Yet more sources claim that Sothea died from overwork in a Khmer Rouge agricultural camp, or that she survived until the Vietnamese invasion of late 1978 or early 1979 but soon died in a hospital from malnutrition.

==Legacy==

Many of Ros Serey Sothea&#x27;s master recordings were either destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime in its efforts to eliminate foreign influences from Cambodian society, or deteriorated rapidly in the tropical environment. However, many vinyl records have survived and have been reissued on cassette or compact disc. Many of the reissued recordings contained overdubs of drum machines and keyboards, and were sometimes sped up. Thus, the original recordings by Sothea and her contemporaries are highly sought by collectors and preservationists.

Sothea&#x27;s older sister Ros Saboeut is widely credited with reuniting Cambodia&#x27;s surviving musicians and bands in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge era. Surviving musicians had initially contacted Ros Saboeut to inquire about Sothea&#x27;s fate; Saboeut used the opportunity to reunite the survivors. According to Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, Ros Saboeut sought to restore Cambodian music as a tribute to her sister, saying &quot;I think she was bound by the legacy of her sister to help.&quot; Her efforts were widely credited with rebuilding the country&#x27;s rock genre.

Ros Serey Sothea has remained extremely popular posthumously in Cambodia and Cambodian communities scattered throughout the United States, France, Australia, and Canada. Western listeners were introduced to her work starting in the late 1990s with the release of the &quot;Cambodian Rocks&quot; bootleg album, followed by the soundtrack to the film &quot;City of Ghosts&quot;. The Los Angeles band Dengue Fever, featuring Cambodian lead singer Chhom Nimol, covers a number of songs by Sothea and her contemporaries in the Cambodian rock scene, as does the band Cambodian Space Project. Sothea was the subject of the 2006 short film &quot;The Golden Voice&quot;, in which she is played by actress Sophea Pel. The film was written and directed by American filmmaker Gregory Cahill. 

Ros Serey Sothea is also profiled extensively in the 2015 documentary film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot;, in which several interview subjects describe her as one of the most important singers in the history of Cambodian popular music. Sothea&#x27;s life was chronicled in the 2023 non-fiction graphic novel &quot;The Golden Voice&quot;, written by Cahill with art by Kat Baumann.

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Judeo-Arabic (; ; ) is Arabic, in its formal and vernacular varieties, as it has been used by Jews, and refers to both written forms and spoken dialects. Although Jewish use of Arabic, which predates Islam, has been in some ways distinct from its use by other religious communities, it is not a uniform linguistic entity. 

Varieties of Arabic formerly spoken by Jews throughout the Arab world have been, in modern times, classified as distinct ethnolects. Under the ISO 639 international standard for language codes, Judeo-Arabic is classified as a macrolanguage under the code jrb, encompassing four languages: Judeo-Moroccan Arabic (aju), Judeo-Yemeni Arabic (jye), Judeo-Egyptian Arabic (yhd), and Judeo-Tripolitanian Arabic (yud).

Judeo-Arabic, particularly in its later forms, contains distinctive features and elements of Hebrew and Aramaic.

Many significant Jewish works, including a number of religious writings by Saadia Gaon, Maimonides and Judah Halevi, were originally written in Judeo-Arabic, as this was the primary vernacular language of their authors.

== History ==

Jewish use of Arabic in Arabia predates Islam. There is evidence of a Jewish Arabic dialect, similar to general Arabic but including some Hebrew and Aramaic lexemes, called &quot;al-Yahūdiyya&quot;, predating Islam. Some of these Hebrew and Aramaic words may have passed into general usage, particularly in religion and culture, though this pre-Islamic Judeo-Arabic was not the basis of a literature.

There were Jewish Pre-Islamic Arabic poets, such as al-Samawʾal ibn ʿĀdiyā, though surviving written records of such Jewish poets do not indicate anything that distinguishes their use of Arabic from non-Jewish use of it, and their work according to Geoffrey Khan is generally not referred to as Judeo-Arabic. This work is similar to and tends to follow Classical Arabic, and Benjamin Hary, who calls it Classical Judeo-Arabic, notes it still includes some dialectal features, such as in Saadia Gaon&#x27;s translation of the Pentateuch. This period includes a wide array of literary works. Scholars assume that Jewish communities in Arabia spoke Arabic as their vernacular language, and some write that there is evidence of the presence of Hebrew and Aramaic words in their speech, as such words appear in the Quran and might have come from contact with these Arabic-speaking Jewish communities.

Before the spread of Islam, Jewish communities in Mesopotamia and Syria spoke Aramaic, while those to the West spoke Romance and Berber. With the Early Muslim conquests, areas including Mesopotamia and the eastern and southern Mediterranean underwent Arabization, most rapidly in urban centers. Some isolated Jewish communities continued to speak Aramaic until the 10th century, and some communities never adopted Arabic as a vernacular language at all. Although urban Jewish communities were using Arabic as their spoken language, Jews kept Hebrew and Aramaic, traditional rabbinic languages, as their languages of writing during the first three centuries of Muslim rule, perhaps due to the presence of the Sura and Pumbedita yeshivas in rural areas where people spoke Aramaic.

Jews in Arabic, Muslim majority countries wrote—sometimes in their dialects, sometimes in a more classical style—in a mildly adapted Hebrew alphabet rather than using the Arabic script, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet.

By around 800 CE, most Jews within the Islamic Empire (90% of the world&#x27;s Jews at the time) were native speakers of Arabic like the populations around them. This led to the development of early Judeo-Arabic. The language quickly became the central language of Jewish scholarship and communication, enabling Jews to participate in the greater epicenter of learning at the time, which meant that they could be active participants in secular scholarship and civilization. The widespread usage of Arabic not only unified the Jewish community located throughout the Islamic Empire but also facilitated greater communication with other ethnic and religious groups, which led to manuscripts like the Toledot Yeshu, being written or published in Arabic or Judeo-Arabic. By the 10th century Judeo-Arabic would transition from Early to Classical Judeo-Arabic.
In al-Andalus, Jewish poets associated with the golden age of Jewish culture in Spain such as Judah Halevi, composed poetry with Arabic. The &quot;muwaššaḥ&quot;, an Andalusi genre of strophic poetry, typically included &quot;kharjas&quot;, or closing lines often in a different language. About half of the corpus of the more than 250 known &quot;muwaššaḥāt&quot; in Hebrew have &quot;kharjas&quot; in Arabic, compared to roughly 50 with Hebrew &quot;kharjas&quot;, and about 25 with Romance. There are also a few &quot;kharjas&quot; with a combination of Hebrew and Arabic.

During the 15th century, as Jews, especially in North Africa, gradually began to identify less with Arabs, Judeo-Arabic would undergo significant changes and become Later Judeo-Arabic. This coincided with increased isolation of Jewish communities and involved greater influence of Hebrew and Aramaic features.

Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish thought were originally written in medieval Judeo-Arabic, as were certain halakhic works and biblical commentaries. Later they were translated into medieval Hebrew so that they could be read by contemporaries elsewhere in the Jewish world, and by others who were literate in Hebrew. These include:

* Saadia Gaon&#x27;s translations of the Pentateuch,&quot;Emunoth ve-Deoth&quot; (originally ), his tafsir (biblical commentary and translation) and &quot;siddur&quot; (explanatory content, not the prayers themselves)
* David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas
* Solomon ibn Gabirol&#x27;s &quot;Tikkun Middot ha-Nefesh&quot;

&quot;Sharch&quot; (&quot;šarḥ&quot;, pl. &quot;šurūḥ&quot;, &quot;šarḥanim&quot;) is a literary genre consisting of the translation of sacred texts, such as Bible translations into Arabic, the Talmud or siddurim, which were composed in Hebrew and Aramaic, into Judeo-Arabic, prevalent starting in the 15th century, and exhibiting a number of mixed elements. The term &quot;sharḥ&quot; sometimes came to mean &quot;Judeo-Arabic&quot; in the same way that &quot;Targum&quot; was sometimes used to mean the Aramaic language. The texts of the &quot;sharh&quot; are based on and dependent on Hebrew.

=== Present day ===
The significant emigration of Judeo-Arabic speakers in the 1940s and 1950s to Israel, France, and North America has led to endangerment or near-extinction of the ethnolects. Judeo-Arabic was viewed negatively in Israel as all Arabic was viewed as an &quot;enemy language&quot;. Their distinct Arabic dialects in turn did not thrive, and most of their descendants now speak French or Modern Hebrew almost exclusively; thus resulting in the entire group of Judeo-Arabic dialects being considered endangered languages. There remain small populations of speakers in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, Yemen, the United States, and Israel.

== Historiography ==
Cultural critic Ella Shohat notes that Jewish speakers of Arabic did not refer to their language as &#x27;Judeo-Arabic&#x27; but simply as &#x27;Arabic&#x27;. In the period of &#x27;massive dislocation&#x27; from the late 1940s through the 1960s, Jewish speakers of Arabic in diaspora and their descendants gradually adopted the term &#x27;Judeo-Arabic&#x27; and its equivalents in French and Hebrew.

The 19th century rediscovery of the Cairo Geniza gave the study of Judeo-Arabic prominence within Judaic Studies, leading to publications such as Shelomo Dov Goitein&#x27;s series &quot;A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza&quot;.

Shohat identifies linguist Yehoshua Blau as a key figure in the development of the notion of Judeo-Arabic, within what she describes as a Zionist linguistic project invested in prioritizing the uniqueness and separateness of isolatable &#x27;Jewish languages&#x27;. Shohat cites the first issue of the Israeli journal &quot;Pe&#x27;amim&quot;, which featured a &quot;Scholars&#x27; Forum&quot; () on &quot;The Jewish Languages – the Common, the Unique and the Problematic&quot; () with articles from Chaim Menachem Rabin &quot; (&#x27;What Distinguishes the Jewish Languages&#x27;) and Yehoshua Blau &quot; (&#x27;Classical Judeo-Arabic&#x27;). This project explicitly sought to describe the Arabic of Jews as a distinct, Jewish language, equating it with Yiddish. According to Esther-Miriam Wagner, the case of Judeo-Arabic reified a Zionist &#x27;Arab vs. Jew&#x27; dichotomy.

== Characteristics ==

The Arabic spoken by Jewish communities in the Arab world differed from the Arabic of their non-Jewish neighbors. Particularly in its later forms, Judeo-Arabic contains distinctive features and elements of Hebrew and Aramaic, such as grammar, vocabulary, orthography, and style.

For example, most Jews in Egypt lived in Cairo and Alexandria and they shared a common dialect. Baghdad Jewish Arabic is reminiscent of the dialect of Mosul. For example, &quot;I said&quot; is &#x27; in the speech of Baghdadi Jews and Christians, as well as in Mosul and Syria, as against Muslim Baghdadi &#x27;.

Some Judeo-Arabic writers, such as Maimonides, were able to switch between varieties of Judeo-Arabic and the Standard Arabic dialect.

Like other Jewish languages and dialects, Judeo-Arabic languages contain borrowings from Hebrew and Aramaic. This feature is less marked in translations of the Bible, as the authors clearly took the view that the business of a translator is to translate.

== Dialects ==
* Judeo-Algerian
* Judeo-Egyptian
* Judeo-Moroccan
* Judeo-Tripolitanian
* Judeo-Tunisian
* Judeo-Yemeni
* Judeo-Syrian
* Judeo-Lebanese
* Modern Palestinian Judeo-Arabic
* Judeo-Iraqi
**Judeo-Baghdadi

== Media ==

Most literature in Judeo-Arabic is of a Jewish nature and is intended for readership by Jewish audiences. There was also widespread translation of Jewish texts from languages like Yiddish and Ladino into Judeo-Arabic, and translation of liturgical texts from Aramaic and Hebrew into Judeo-Arabic. There is also Judeo-Arabic videos on YouTube.

A collection of over 400,000 of Judeo-Arabic documents from the 6th-19th centuries was found in the Cairo Geniza.

The movie &quot;Farewell Baghdad&quot; would be released in 2013 entirely in Judeo-Iraqi Arabic

== Orthography ==
Judeo-Arabic orthography uses a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet called the Judeo-Arabic script. It is written from right to left horizontally like the Hebrew script and also like the Hebrew script some letters contain final versions, used only when that letter is at the end of a word. It also uses the letters &quot;alef&quot; and &quot;waw&quot; or &quot;yodh&quot; to mark long or short vowels respectively. The order of the letters varies between alphabets.

<text>Skyfire is a Swedish melodic death metal band from Höör, Skåne County. Formed in 1995, its initial lineup comprised Andreas Edlund (guitar), Martin Hanner (bass guitar), Jonas Sjögren (guitar) and Tobias Björk (drums). The band&#x27;s lineup has significantly changed since its inception.

The band released their first album, &quot;Timeless Departure&quot;, in March 2001, and have released several albums and extended plays since.

== Biography ==
Skyfire was formed in the town of Höör, Sweden in 1995 by Andreas Edlund (guitar), Martin Hanner (bass guitar), Jonas Sjögren (guitar) and Tobias Björk (drums). The four were friends since high school and had similar tastes in music. The band recorded two demos: &quot;Within Reach&quot; and &quot;The Final Story&quot;. On the second demo, the vocals were performed by Henrik Wenngren. Skyfire got in touch with band members of Thyrfing who helped them find a record label with Dutch label Hammerheart Records. During two weeks in August 2000, Skyfire recorded their debut album &quot;Timeless Departure&quot; in the Abyss Studio.

In September 2002, the band recorded their second album &quot;Mind Revolution&quot;, again in the Abyss Studio with new drummer Joakim Jonsson. &quot;Mind Revolution&quot; was released in 2003 and showed the band&#x27;s style evolving and branching off into different musical genres. The third album &quot;Spectral&quot; was recorded at Los Angered and Studio Underground and released on 10 May 2004 by Arise Records.

The vocalist Henrik Wenngren left the band and was replaced by Joakim Karlsson.

On 7 January 2008, Skyfire announced on their official MySpace page that they had signed with a Florida-based label Pivotal Rockordings, for a three-album deal, and the band entered the recording studio to begin recording their fourth untitled album. Mixing was done by Scar Symmetry&#x27;s Jonas Kjellgren at Black Lounge Studios.

On 15 May 2009, Skyfire announced a digital only EP entitled &quot;Fractal&quot; for a July 2009 release. The EP is a collection of B-sides recorded between 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spectral&quot; and &quot;Esoteric&quot;. &quot;Fractal&quot; was released on 6 July for digital download.

Skyfire&#x27;s fourth album is titled &quot;Esoteric&quot; and was released on 14 September 2009 in the United Kingdom via Pivotal Rockordings. The album was released on 18 September 2009 in the rest of Europe and in North America on 13 October 2009 due to a scheduling issue. The cover art was created by Pär Olofsson, who also made covers for Brain Drill, Psycroptic, Spawn of Possession, Persuader and others.

On 4 July 2017, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund their newest EP &quot;Liberation in Death&quot;. The campaign was successful, raising the full amount needed in under eight hours. However, the band has been put on hold since then.

<text>The Vascones were a pre-Roman tribe who, on the arrival of the Romans in the 1st century, inhabited a territory that spanned between the upper course of the Ebro river and the southern basin of the western Pyrenees, a region that coincides with present-day Navarre, western Aragon and northeastern La Rioja, in the Iberian Peninsula. The Vascones are often considered ancestors of the present-day Basques to whom they left their name.

== Territory ==

=== Roman period ===
The description of the territory which the Vascones inhabited during ancient times appears in texts of classical authors, between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD, such as Livy, Strabo, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy. Although these texts have been studied as sources of reference, some authors have pointed out the apparent lack of uniformity and also the existence of contradictions within the texts, in particular with Strabo.

The oldest document corresponds to Livy (59 BC – AD 17), who in a brief passage of his work about the 76 BC Sertorian War relates how after crossing the Ebro and the city of &quot;Calagurris Nasica&quot;, they crossed the flatlands of the Vascones, or Vasconum agrum until reaching the border of their immediate neighbors, the Berones. Comparing other sections of this same document, it is deduced that this border was located to the west, while the southern neighbors of the Vascones were the Celtiberians, with their city, &quot;Contrebia Leucade&quot;.

Pliny the Elder, on his work &quot;Natural History&quot;, mentioned a text prior to 50 BC that located the Vascones at the western end of the Pyrenees, neighbors of the Varduli and extended to the mountains of &quot;Oiarso&quot; and into the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, in an area he called Vasconum saltus. The Greek geographer Strabo, in the times of Augustus (63 BC – AD 14) refers to the Vascones (in Ancient Greek: &quot;Ούασκώνων&quot;) placing their main city, or &quot;polis&quot;, in &quot;Pompaelo&quot; and as well &quot;Callagurris&quot;.

This information is found again in the works of Ptolemy, who lived during the 1st and 2nd Century AD. In his book, &quot;Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis&quot;, chapter 6, he relates the names of 15 cities inside the territory of the Vascones, besides Oiarso: &quot;Iturissa&quot;, &quot;Pompaelo&quot;, &quot;Bituris&quot;, &quot;Andelos&quot;, &quot;Nemanturissa&quot;, &quot;Curnonium&quot;, &quot;Iacca&quot;, &quot;Graccurris&quot;, &quot;Calagurris&quot;, &quot;Cascantum&quot;, &quot;Ercavica&quot;, &quot;Tarraga&quot;, &quot;Muscaria&quot;, &quot;Seguia&quot; and &quot;Alavona&quot;.

The territory of the Vascones during the Roman republic and Roman empire corresponded with present-day Navarre, the northeast extreme of Gipuzkoa, and parts of La Rioja, Zaragoza and Huesca, including the city of &quot;Calagurris&quot;.

=== 3rd and 4th centuries ===
==== Late Basquisation ====
During this period, after the time of Ptolemy and contemporary to the times of instability caused by the Germanic invasions, the documents about the Vascones and other tribes of the northern Iberian Peninsula are scarce, and as a result there is little information about the Vascones during this time.

The chronicler John of Biclaro (c. 540 – after 621) mentions the Vascones in a story about the foundation of the city of &quot;Victoriacum&quot; by the Visigoth king Liuvigild and Gregory of Tours (538–594) mentions the incursions of &quot;Wascones&quot; in Aquitaine during the year 587. From these extracts and being the neighboring tribes absent in the historiography, Adolf Schulten (1870–1960) proposed the theory according to which, at some point between the mid-2nd century and late 4th century, an enlargement of the territory of the Vascones took place, first in the west, occupying the lands of the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones, and later in the north in Aquitaine. Schulten considers this to be the reason for the adoption of the name &quot;Gascony&quot;, which derives from &quot;Gascon&quot;, which comes from &quot;Vascon&quot;, and used to denominate a region that includes the present-day Northern Basque Country.

Claudio Sánchez Albornoz, Spanish historian (1893–1984), on his work &quot;Los vascones vasconizan la depresión vasca&quot; (&quot;The Vascones &quot;basquize&quot; the Basque depression&quot;) published in 1972 expanded upon this hypothesis, relying on linguistic analysis: when invading the territories of what today is Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Álava displaced to Castile part of the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones, who took refuge in the mountains; the ones who had not been displaced were &quot;Basquized&quot;, while perhaps the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones already spoke languages similar or related to the Basque language.

However, research during last decades has called into question the possibility of an expansion northwards (J. J. Larrea). The inroad of the Vascones onto the plains of Aquitaine in 587 seems to be short-lived—they make their way back to the mountains—and archaeological findings in Eauze or Auch do not reveal instability or destruction during the alleged expanding period up to the mid-7th century. Another theory suggests a contemporary identification made by the Goths and the Franks of the Vascones (the most dynamic tribe) with all Basque speaking, Basque-related, or non-Romanized tribes.

==== 7th century ====

Starting in the 7th century, historians differentiate between &quot;Spagnovasconia&quot;, located southwestern of the Pyrenees, inside the Iberian Peninsula and &quot;Guasconia&quot;, northwestern of the Pyrenees, in Aquitaine. Schulten interprets that by this time the Vascones had already retreated from their territories in Roman times and started occupying lands in the north, what in the future would make the Southern Basque Country and northern Navarre. Schulten also quotes the chronicle from Einhard, &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;, dated in 810, where for the first time is used the term &quot;navarrese&quot; to define the people living in the former territories of the Vascones near the Ebro.

== History ==

===Roman period===

Unlike the Aquitanians or Cantabrians, the Vascones seemed to have negotiated their status in the Roman Empire. In the Sertorian War, Pompey established his headquarters in their territory, founding Pompaelo. Romanization was rather intense in the area known as &quot;Ager Vasconum&quot; (the Ebro valley) but limited in the mountainous &quot;Saltus&quot;, where evidence of Roman civilization appears only in mining places, harbours, roads, and milestones, e.g. Oiasso. The territory was also important for Romans as a communication knot between northern Hispania and southwestern Gallia, who took good care to station detachments in different spots of the main communication lines.

The Vasconian area presents indications of upheaval (burnt villas, an abundance of mints to pay the garrisons) during the 4th and 5th centuries that have been linked by many historians to the Bagaudae rebellions against feudalization, but also to the depredations of migrating Germanic and Asian tribes—Vandals, Alans, Sueves, Visigoths, possibly Heruls—into Hispania.

===Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages===

In AD 407 Vascon troops fought on the orders of Roman commanders Didimus and Verinianus, repelling an attack by Vandals, Alans and Suebi. In 409, the passage of the Germanic peoples and Sarmatians toward Hispania went unhindered. The Roman reaction to this invasion and unrest related to the Bagaudae was to give Gallia Aquitania and Hispania Tarraconensis to the Visigoths in return for their services as allies by treaty (&quot;foederati&quot;). The Visigoths soon managed to expel the Vandals to Africa.

After chronicler Hydatius´s death in 469, no contemporary source exists reporting on the social and political situation in &quot;the Vasconias&quot;, as put by himself. At the beginning of the fourth century, Calagurris is still cited as a Vascon town. During the fifth and sixth centuries, the gap between town and the rural milieu widened, with the former falling much in decay. Between 581-7, chronicles start to mention the Vascones again, this time hailing from the wilderness, as opposed to the towns, which remained attached to Roman culture or were under Germanic influence. By the seventh to eighth centuries, Vascones were not confined to their ancient boundaries, but covered a much larger territory, from Álava in the west to the Loire in the north. The island of Oléron, along with the Île de Ré, formed the &quot;Vacetae Insulae&quot; &quot;Vacetian Islands&quot; according to the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, where Vaceti are Vascones by another name. The concept underlying the medieval name points to a much wider reality than Strabo&#x27;s former tribal definition, this time encompassing all Basque-speaking tribes.

The independent Vascones stabilised their first polity under the Merovingian Franks: the Duchy of Vasconia, whose borders to the south remained unclear. This duchy would eventually become Gascony. During the reincorporation of Vasconia into Francia after 769, Charlemagne destroyed the walls of Pamplona after a failed attempt to conquer Zaragoza, the Vascones annihilated his rearguard in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778—referred as &quot;wasconicam perfidiam&quot; by Frankish chroniclers. Pamplona was later captured by the Cordovan emir &#x27;Abd al-Rahman I (781), but taken over by the Franks in 806, who assigned its government to a pro-Frankish local Belasko (&quot;al-Galashki&quot;), probably a Basque hailing from present-day Gascony. Some decades later, in 824, a second battle of Roncevaux took place that led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Pamplona, founded with Eneko Arista as head of the new polity, presented by Arab sources as leader of the Vascones (&quot;al-Baskunisi&quot;). However, the 824 Carolingian expedition itself included two different columns made up of Frankish and Vascones (Gascons).

After the 9th century, the Vascones (&quot;Wascones&quot;, &quot;Guascones&quot;) come to be more closely identified in the records with the current territory of Gascony, at the time still a Basque-speaking territory but progressively being replaced by the new rising Romance language, Gascon.

== Culture ==

=== Language and writing ===

Several authors point out that prior to the Roman arrival and alike other peoples that inhabited the near region, the Vascones spoke a language that linguists identify as the precursor of the modern Basque language, sometimes referred to as Proto-Basque language or Aquitanian language.

However, as pointed out by Henrike Knörr (1947-2008) the origin and kinship of the Basque language is still a mystery and an object of research. There are several theories about its origin; the Basque linguistic Koldo Mitxelena argues that an &quot;in-situ&quot; origin is the most likely, and thus explains the current dialectical classification while other theories advocate for a proposed kinship between the Basque language and other language families, like the languages of the Caucasus or a relation between Basque and the extinct Iberian language. So far, possible connections between Basque and other languages have remained unproven.

Another problem that arises in the study of the language of the Vascones is the lack of direct classic records regarding the language spoken by this people, with the exception of a vague description by Strabo and Pomponius Mela, or the description made by Julius Caesar on the language of the Aquitanians in his work &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;.

The study of epigraphic documents has been of greater interest, as some of them date the introduction of writing among the Vascones in the 2nd century. Among them, the oldest are the numismatic evidence coming from both Vasconic mints and others located nearby. A great importance is given to a funerary stele found in the Hermitage of Santa Bárbara in Lerga, which was considered to be the oldest known written testimony of the Proto-Basque language until an inscription from the 1st century BC was found in 2022. It is also believed that the Iberian language has left some traces on the Basque language, as with the Iberian term &quot;ili&quot;, adopted in Basque as &quot;hiri&quot; with the meaning of town or city, and present in the Vasconic name for the city of &quot;Pompaelo&quot;: &quot;Iruña&quot;, as well as in other names of cities and towns.

=== Religion ===

The epigraphic and archaeological testimonies have allowed experts to determine some of the religious practices that were present among the Vascones since the Roman arrival and the introduction of writing. According to research done on this topic, religious syncretism lasted until the 1st Century; from that moment onwards and until the adoption of Christianity between the 4th and 5th centuries, Roman mythology was predominant.

Vasconic theonyms have been found on tombstones and altars, which further proves the syncretism between the pre-Christian Roman systems of beliefs and the Vasconic religions. Two altars have been found in Ujué, one dedicated to &quot;Lacubegi&quot;, identified as the &quot;God of the lower world&quot; and another one dedicated to Jupiter, although it has not been possible to date them. In Lerate and Barbarin two tombstones have been found, both dedicated to &quot;Stelaitse&quot; and dated in the 1st century.

<text>Christopher Allen Darden (born April 7, 1956) is an American lawyer, author, and lecturer. He worked for 15 years in the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office, where he gained national attention as a co-prosecutor in the murder trial of O. J. Simpson.

==Early life and education==
Darden was born in Richmond, California, the fourth of eight siblings. After graduating from John F. Kennedy High School in 1974, Darden enrolled at San Jose State University, where he participated in track and field and joined Alpha Phi Alpha, an African-American fraternity. He received his B.S. in criminal justice administration in 1977. Darden received his Juris Doctor from the University of California, Hastings, in 1980.

==Career==
Darden took and passed the California Bar Exam in the summer of 1980. Four months afterward, he was hired at the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles. Looking for a career change, he applied for and was hired for a position with the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s Office. Darden was initially assigned to the Huntington Park office before moving on to Beverly Hills, and finally moved to the Criminal Courts Building (CCB) in downtown Los Angeles in late 1983.

During his tenure as a prosecutor at the CCB, Darden served in the central trials and hard-core gang units before transferring to the Special Investigation Division (SID), which investigates criminal activity by public and law enforcement officials, in February 1988. It was in this position that Darden first met Johnnie Cochran, who represented some victims of alleged police violence. Darden and Cochran became close friends, with Darden seeing Cochran as a mentor figure.

Darden initially became involved in the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson after being asked by Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman to lead the prosecution of Al Cowlings, Simpson&#x27;s friend and the driver of the white Ford Bronco during the infamous car chase. After Darden&#x27;s work on the Cowlings case ended, Clark requested Darden join the Simpson team as case manager since she and Hodgman were bogged down by various motions and filings from the defense. Darden was also tasked by Clark to prepare the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses for testimony, including preparing testimony for key witness Detective Mark Fuhrman. After Hodgman was incapacited by stress-related illness in the courtroom shortly before opening statements, Darden was named co-prosecutor. Darden&#x27;s friendship with Cochran, who was a prominent figure on Simpson&#x27;s defense team, became heavily strained due to their clashing positions regarding the inclusion of racism in the case. Simpson was ultimately acquitted. Darden incidentally normalized the term &quot;N-word&quot;, a euphemistic alternative reference to the word &quot;nigger&quot;, as the first public figure to use that term, while cross-examining Fuhrman.

Darden left the District Attorney&#x27;s office after the Simpson case and joined the faculty of the Southwestern University School of Law. Darden taught and specialized in criminal procedure and trial advocacy.

Darden is a former legal commentator for CNBC, CNN, Court TV, and NBC, and a frequent guest and commentator on CNN, Court TV, and Fox News Network. He has made guest appearances on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, The Howard Stern Show, &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot;, the movie &quot;Liar Liar&quot; (uncredited), and the TV movie &quot;One Hot Summer Night&quot; (in which he plays a disgruntled policeman). He is the former principal attorney in the syndicated legal show &quot;Power of Attorney&quot;.

Darden is also a writer. In addition to &quot;In Contempt&quot;, which chronicles his experiences with the Simpson trial, he co-authored (with Dick Lochte) a number of crime novels, including &quot;The Trials of Nikki Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;LA Justice&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Last Defense&quot; (2002).

He appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1996 with an article &quot;My Case Against O.J.&quot;, which addressed his involvement and prosecution of Simpson.

Darden left the law school in 1999 and started his own firm, Darden &amp; Associates, Inc., specializing in criminal defense and civil litigation. In December 2007, he was considered for a judgeship by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In an interview by Oprah Winfrey that aired February 9, 2006, Darden stated that he still believed Simpson was guilty. He added that he was nearly as disgusted with the perjury of Mark Fuhrman as by the murders of Goldman and Simpson.

On September 6, 2012, Darden accused deceased Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran of manipulating&#x27; one of the infamous gloves&quot;, a claim Alan Dershowitz has called &quot;a total fabrication&quot;, saying, &quot;the defense doesn&#x27;t get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.&quot;

Darden represented Eric Ronald Holder, Jr. in his arraignment on April 4, 2019. Darden entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Holder, who is accused of murdering Nipsey Hussle. Darden dropped out of the case May 10, the same day as the court date. Darden received multiple death threats for representing Holder.

, Darden is representing a man accused of pulling a knife on a television crew at a COVID-19 anti-lockdown protest rally in Huntington Beach and forcing them to delete footage.

It was reported in August 2020 that Darden would briefly represent Corey Walker for arraignment, the alleged killer of rapper Pop Smoke.

Darden ran for judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court in 2024, but lost to Leslie Gutierrez.
