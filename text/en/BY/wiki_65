<text>The urbanization of most of Africa is moving fast forward, especially south of the Sahara. It is estimated that in 1900, about 89% of inhabitants lived from the primary occupations of farming, hunting and gathering, cattle nomadism, and fishing (Aase, 2003:1) meaning that 11% or less were urban. At the start of the independence period in 1957, 14.7% of Africa&#x27;s inhabitants were urban, in 2000 had it risen to 37.2% and it is expected to rise to 49.3% in 2015, in effect 3.76% to 3.35% per year (UN, 2002). In sub-Saharan Africa in 1960 &quot;only one city, Johannesburg, had a population of one million;...in 2009, there were fifty-two cities with such large populations.&quot; The Nigerian city of Lagos that in 1963 had 665,000 inhabitants (Rakodi, 1997) and 8.7 million in 2000 is expected to become the world&#x27;s 11th biggest city by 2015 with 16 million inhabitants (UN, 2002).

==Pre-colonial times==

The process of urbanization required some initial conditions to be met before the process could begin. The purpose of towns was to support the labor of those who were not in agriculture, whether that be craftsmen, priests, traders, landlords, etc. According to Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, there are three conditions needed for urbanization to begin. First, there must be a food surplus to feed those who are not employed in agriculture. Second, there must be a ruling class that facilitates the movement of this food surplus from those who create it to those living within the city. Finally, there must be merchants and traders to supply this new working class with the materials necessary to accomplish their work. The structure of many African cities is quite different from the normal western city, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa but also in the Nile Valley The structure of the city did not include stone structures, and if they did, it was sparsely in the city center. This kind of city was called a &quot;Giant Village,&quot; and it allowed the city to move when resources became depleted. Most of the structures built were made of wattle and daub, often even the chiefs quarters. These &quot;Giant Village&#x27;s&quot; were characterized by very low population density and very large cities in area; at most, they had up to 50,000 people living in these cities.

In pre-colonial Africa, young men would often challenge the authority of their elders. This could often times create tension between the ethnic groups and a constant struggle for who has authority over one another. Constant struggle in this manner doesn&#x27;t allow for growth and innovation.

===Nile Valley===

The earliest known cities of Africa emerged around the Nile Valley. Alexandria was founded in Egypt in 331 BC and is famous for the lighthouse Pharos, for a legendary library, and for the martyrdom of Hypatia of Alexandria. While more Ancient Greek papyri were preserved in the sands of Egypt than anywhere else in the ancient world, relatively few from Alexandria still remain. There were also many early cities in Sub-Saharan Africa. Meroe (present-day Sudan) was one of the major cities in the Kush kingdom. For several centuries after the sacking of Napata in 590 BC, the Meroitic kingdom developed independently of Egypt, reaching its height in the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. Meroe advanced in iron technology, and building construction dates back to at least 900 BC. Meroe was a great center of agriculture at its height.

Africa north of the Sahara has long had political and cultural contact with people outside of Africa. It is physically separated from the rest of the continent as well, making for quite a difference between the people in North Africa and the rest of the continent. North Africa and the Nile Valley urbanized rapidly compared to the rest of Africa, and this exposure to other cultures had a large impact on growth.

===West Africa===

Between AD 700 to 1600, cities in the West African savanna emerged from the trans-Saharan trade. Some of the more prominent were Kumbi Saleh, Timbuktu, Djenné and Gao. Arabic scholars like Ibn Khaldun have been a very important source of historical accounts from this area and period. Gold mining, iron technology, pottery making and textile production were the important technologies. In the commercial and capital center of Ghana Empire (not present Ghana) Kumbi Saleh an elaborate economic system including taxation was developed. The growth and strength of the 3 kingdoms of Mali, Ghana, and Songhai can be attributed to their fertile and easily farmable environment. This allowed them to create a surplus of rice, as well as their long-distance trade of salt and gold.

In the West African forest region, cities developed among the Yoruba, Fulani, Hausa people as well as in the Ashanti Empire and Benin kingdom. As well as being commercial and political centers they worked as spiritual centers. One of the largest cities in the region was Old Oyo, a &quot;Great Village&quot; with an area of 5252.5 ha, and an estimated population of 100,000.

===Central Africa===

In the central African equatorial region cities could be found in what is today Congo, DR Congo, Angola, Zambia, Rwanda and Burundi. In what is now DR Congo, Musumba was the capital city of Lunda. In the Mangbetu Kingdom districts changed their structure to fit the need of the kingdom. There is evidence of equal dispersion of villages of equal sizes transforming into larger clumped villages in times of war or when trade route were diverted through the village and then reverted back when those times have passed back to equally dispersed villages of equal sizes. 

Important cities:

*M&#x27;banza-Kongo, capital of the Kongo Empire
*Ryamurari, capital of the Ndorwa kingdom (Rwanda)
*Kiguba, capital of the Buganda kingdom (Uganda)

=== East Africa ===
The Ethiopian Empire amassed a large number of trade networks and acquired western goods as a result. Although Ethiopia had these successful trade networks, limits to urbanization were closely connected to societal limits on surplus accumulation. Cities were forced to remain small, with an average population typically not exceeding 2000 to 4000 inhabitants. 

Axum, capital of the Ethiopian kingdom lasted from the first century AD until about the 10th century AD. It had an extensive trade network with the Roman Mediterranean, south Arabia and India, trading ivory, precious metals, clothing and spices. Axumian stone artwork (monoliths has been preserved, and bear proof of their advances in quarrying, stone carving, terracing, building construction and irrigation.

===Coastal East Africa===
The lack of fertile ground in East Africa is made up for with its vast access to the sea and its resources, with limited available land cities had to be compact and with the creation of two storied houses it shows evidence of a more scarce land market than other regions.

In this region a Swahili Angli Moslemic culture emerged.

Important cities:
*Barawa
*Gedi (present Kenya)
*Kilwa (present Tanzania)
*Mafia
*Malindi (present Kenya)
*Mogadishu
*Mombasa (present Kenya)
*Mozambique
*Pate
*Pemba
*Quelimane
*Sofala
*Zanzibar (present Tanzania)
Many of these cities were likely closely interrelated with one another, especially when looking at historical Swahili culture villages and settlements.

Technological developments included coin minting, copper works, building craftsmanship, boat building, cotton textile. External trade was very active and important with Asia and Arabia.

===Southern Africa===

Stone-built ruins are numerous and widely spread in southern Africa. Zimbabwe testifies to an urban Shona civilization that left many ruins, even showing evidence for complex agriculture. Many of these structures were cattle enclosures carbon dated all the way back to 1000 AD, the number of these structures suggested a very dense population. Great Zimbabwe is one of the more famous pre-colonial cities of Africa. Its Great Enclosure is considered the largest single prehistoric structure in Africa. The earliest inhabitants of the Angola area are believed to have been Khoisan hunter-gatherers whose remains date back to the Old Stone Age.

==Colonial times==

With the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 as a foundation, Africa was apportioned among the European powers. In 1914 only Ethiopia and Liberia were left as independent states, the remainder of the continent was under British, French, Portuguese, German, Belgian, Italian or Spanish control. It was the interest of these powers that governed the borders. The continent had almost no urban population and the colonial powers had not started to invest much in its «pieces» (Hernæs, 2003a). A good example is Northern Nigeria Protectorate that in 1900 had a budget of £100,000, a military force of 2000 Hausa-soldiers and 120 British Army officers. With this they were to govern an enormous area with a population of about 10 million people.

The economic and administrative politics had the greatest effect on urbanization. The important export products cash crops (including cotton, maize, tobacco, sugar, coffee, tea, palm oil, and groundnuts) and minerals had to be transported to the harbour towns for export. For this railway transport was needed, and to run the colony administration and personnel was needed. The central administration was often placed in harbour town, but there was not developed any network of small and middle-sized cities (Aase, 2003:3).

New cities were placed in an existing settlement or at a completely new site. Completely new cities were especially developed in the copper zone to house the mine workers. Examples include Johannesburg and Kimberley in South Africa, Ndola and Kitwe in Zambia and Lubumbashi in DR Congo.

A strong centralised political system was also important in the development of early urban centres for example in the Ndebele Kingdom under Mzilikazi and later on Lobengula

Some cities were used and some were ignored. Close to the main lines of transportation the cities grew, while towns that were ignored by transportation and administration in effect disappeared, as for example Kukawa and Dahomey.

It was in the cities of transportation and administration that contact with government and commerce was possible. As a consequence it was invested in these cities leading to the need of workforce. The commercial politics of raw inputs exporting to finance the colony and develop Africa governed the way what cities that should grow.

At the same time the colonial powers became aware of the problems that urbanization brought with it. The rural-urban migration pulled labour away from the countryside where the important export products were made. The Africans usually lived in small spaces and under poor sanitary conditions. They were therefore prone to illnesses like malaria. One of the colonial governments&#x27; response was to separate Europeans, Asians and Africans from each other and establish influx control laws. In South Africa this resulted in the official policy of apartheid from 1950. This was also a policy that was especially common in settler cities like Harare, Lusaka and Nairobi.

With the Great Depression in the 1930s, prices of African export products dropped. This in turn led to an economic downturn and unemployment. The mining workforce before the depression had been mostly temporary or seasonal, often also forced labour. The workers therefore lived in mining cities away from home and their families in the countryside.

From the 1920s in Belgian Congo and from the 1940s in South Africa and South and North Rhodesia the mining companies started to prefer more permanent workers. The authorities changed their policies to facilitate the change, and after a while also moved the working men&#x27;s families into the cities. The new policies tried to strengthen the authorities&#x27; control over land and city growth, and make life easier for the European administration.

The effect of the apartheid and similar policies can be illustrated by comparing urban growth rate in Southern Africa, with that of the rest of Africa in the 1950s. This also illustrates that the policy was not working or not effective in the other colonies: The urban growth rate of Southern Africa was about 3.3%, compared to about 4.6% for the whole of Africa.

As the economy grew, the cities also grew. The colonial authorities started to strengthen the development policies that had suffered because of the 1930s depression. Social services, especially primary schools, but also secondary schools, and in the end of the colonial period also a few universities were built. Important infrastructure such as harbours, electricity grid and roads was further developed. All this caused growing administration, growing exports and growing cities, that grew even more in the post colonial period.

World War II caused considerable urbanization and industrialization in the Union of South Africa and led to large numbers of non-whites migrating to cities to seek work in factories. This trend led to increasing dissent against the white minority&#x27;s racial segregation policies and housing shortages, with many blacks barred from entering cities because of pass laws living in squatter camps such as Soweto. The ruling United Party under Jan Smuts issued the Fagan Report recommending easing of segregation as a solution to the tensions, while the opposition Herenigde Nasionale Party under J. B. M. Hertzog and D. F. Malan issued the Sauer Report recommending the opposite solution of intensified segregation. The HNP won the 1948 South African general election and subsequently implemented these policies as apartheid.

==Postcolonial period==
Most of today&#x27;s African countries gained their formal independence in the 1960s. The new countries seemed to have a great faith in planned economy regardless of how they gained their independence. The government should actively develop the country, not only by building infrastructure and developing social services; but also by developing industry and employment. Many parastatal companies are today left as &#x27;white elephants&#x27; and demonstrate the great investments that were made in the cities at the beginning of the post-colonial period (Rakodi, 1997).

For many reasons it was thought that centralisation equalled a strong (powerful) state (government). The reasons could be
*the wish to induce a feeling of nationhood, which also led to the establishment of brand new capitals (to be mentioned later);
*a lack of qualified government officers; someone had to do the work that the colonial officers had done, but in some places these people simply did not exist;
*the fear that local authorities would turn against central authorities. (Rakodi, 1997).

Centralization meant that companies had even more reason to establish themselves in the already large capitals because this was closest to power. In effect this led to a huge concentration of investment in urban areas. For example, in Nigeria where 80% of investments not related to agriculture was spent in urban areas (Rakodi, 1997).

New cities were also established in the post-colonial period, but not for the same reasons as in the colonial period. The seaport Tema in Ghana was built awaiting great industrial growth. Later, new capitals were built, inspired by the planned city of Brasília in Brazil. This happened in Malawi (Lilongwe), Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (Yamoussoukro) and Nigeria (Abuja) (Stock, 1995). The new capitals were meant to give the nation a &#x27;fresh start&#x27;, they were supposed to be the beginning of a new golden future promised by the liberation politicians.

As none of the new capitals have grown to more than about half a million inhabitants, they have probably not had much influence on the growth of the already established cities. Tema could be said to be a success as it is the most important port today, and together with Accra represent the biggest metropolitan area in Ghana (The World Bank Group, 2001; UN, 2003b; Obeng-Odoom, 2013).

At the same time as influx-control regulations were intensified in South Africa, this kind of regulation was weakened in the newly liberated countries. This led to more rural-urban migration in the newly liberated countries (Rakodi, 1997), and a stable decline in urbanization growth from 1950 to 1990 in South Africa.
From figure 1 one can see that after the end of apartheid in 1990, the urbanization rate grow from 2.29% to 3.41%, while it continues to sink in the rest of Africa. The abandonment of the influx-control regulations in 1986 is a part of this picture. The city of Bloemfontein grew 51% between 1988 and 1996. (The Ministry of the Flemish Government, 2001).
Influx control regulation was active in South Africa until 1986–90, while in the rest of Africa they were more or less abandoned or without effect. However, even the remnants of these regulations could have an effect on how the cities grew, since they made it difficult to get hold of legally owned land. This again led to the illegitimate occupation of land.

One reason for people wanting to move from rural to urban areas is that they think living will be better there. A comparison between HDI rank and urbanization level in Africa could show that there might be some sense in this belief. The five African countries that in 2001 ranked highest on the United Nations Human Development Index was also some of the most urbanised, see figure 2.
In some countries rural inhabitants have been given even more reasons to migrate to the city by lower food prices in the cities, often because of pressure from trade unions. This in turn has led to lowered income in rural areas and therefore higher migration to urban areas. (Rakodi, 1997; Aase, 2003).

Finally it should be mentioned that war and economic misconduct have led to the dilution of rural resources and periodically very high rural-urban migration. At the end of the 1980s, there were only 18 African countries that had not experienced a military coup against their government (Rakodi, 1997).(Written by Josiah Naidoo).

==Summary==
The urbanization rate in Africa is slowing, but so is the population growth rate, much because of HIV/AIDS (UN, 2003a). The big cities of Africa will probably continue to grow, but the future is as always uncertain. In 1994 it was expected that Lagos would become the world&#x27;s third biggest city with 24.4 million inhabitants by 2015 (Todaro, 1997), but in 2001 this was adjusted to the world&#x27;s eleventh biggest city with &#x27;only&#x27; 16 million inhabitants (UN, 2002). This shows how uncertain the numbers are, and how unpredictable the African population development is.

It is evident that like in the rest of the world, the African urbanization process has mainly been influenced by economy. The colonial powers placed ports, railways and mines to economically strategic places. The cities have both in colonial and post-colonial times been economically prioritized. People came to these places for nationalistic pride, work, administration, education and social services. The exception is South Africa who, with its strict influx control regime and apartheid policy, to a certain degree managed to control urban growth. It is nonetheless one of the most urbanized countries of Africa and now has a low urbanization growth.

<text>Lost luggage is luggage conveyed by a public carrier such as an airline, seafaring cruise ship, shipping company, or railway which fails to arrive at the correct destination with the passenger. In the United States, an average of 1 in 150 people have their checked baggage misdirected or left behind each year.

==Issues==

Luggage is more likely to be lost or misdirected if the journey has several legs, as each transfer between different vehicles increases the chance that bags will be mishandled. There are many causes of lost luggage. If a passenger arrives late for a flight, there may not be time for their luggage to be loaded onto the plane. If tags are accidentally torn off, the airport may not know where to send the luggage. Human error is also common: tags may be misread or luggage may be sent to the wrong place. Occasionally, a plane may lack sufficient space or have reached its maximum takeoff weight. Security delays can also cause bags to arrive on a later flight than their owner. Luggage is taken through customs after its owner claims it.

In case of lost luggage, travelers are advised to carry all essentials in a carry-on bag, including a change of clothes and anything they would be greatly troubled to lose because of its monetary or emotional value (this excludes security restricted items, that can not be carried inside the passenger cabin). Occasionally luggage is completely lost and cannot be recovered. The airline will then normally compensate the owner. The passenger must then list the contents of their baggage and file a claim.

Bags can also be damaged during travel, but most damage (such as broken wheels and handles) is not covered under the airlines&#x27; contract of carriage. Some airlines, however, will still repair such damage as a good faith gesture, or offer a discount voucher for a future flight. In general airlines regard the purpose of luggage to be the protection of its contents during transit. If the luggage is damaged, even severely, but the contents are unharmed, then airlines regard the luggage as having fulfilled its purpose and will not compensate owners.

===Recovery===
When a traveler reports his luggage is lost at airport or airline, a case is opened with WorldTracer, a global network for tracing lost luggage.

Most lost luggage is quickly sent by the airline to the correct destination. Airlines will often reimburse passengers for toiletries, clothing, and other essentials if the arrival airport is away from the passenger&#x27;s home area. In most cases, when delayed luggage arrives, a courier service will deliver it to the passenger&#x27;s home or hotel. The airline usually pays for this.

==Compensation==
Compensation for lost luggage is governed by the Montreal Convention and its predecessor the Warsaw Convention. Per the Montreal Convention, the maximum liability of an airline per lost checked item is 1131 special drawing rights (SDR), while under the Warsaw Convention the maximum liability is 17 SDR per kilogram.

==Unclaimed baggage center==
Most airlines maintain stores where they sell the contents of lost or abandoned luggage. If a baggage is never recovered, it is usually because it has been mistaken by another passenger as his or her own baggage. Alternatively it could have been stolen either by another passenger or an airport employee (perhaps with an accomplice).

In 2004, a baggage handler at Baltimore-Washington International Airport was arrested for the theft of mail sent by airplane, including credit cards.

The majority of unclaimed baggage in the United States, whether by being lost or misdirected, or simply forgotten by travelers, is handled by the Unclaimed Baggage Center in Scottsboro, Alabama, which has contracts with most major airlines. Eventually, the luggage sent to UBC is resold for a profit.

==Statistics==
The U.S. Department of Transportation maintains air travel consumer reports, which include statistics on mishandled baggage. For the first quarter of 2017, Virgin America was ranked first for reports of lost luggage with 1.45 reports per 1,000 passengers.

Rates for lost luggage decreases year after year, due to the constant efforts made by the airlines. The handling market is $2.74 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow by 2.1% until 2023. After a significant decrease in the first decade of 2000, number of lost luggage cannot drop much more again, or at the margin only. There is now under 3‰ luggage lost per 1,000 passengers carried on US domestic flights.

MTH&#x27;s founder, Mike Wolf, started assembling and selling trains at the age of 12 in 1973 for Williams Electric Trains, which had begun producing reproductions of vintage trains manufactured by Lionel Corporation, in the early 1970s. By 1980, Wolf was operating a mail order business selling Williams trains and parts out of his bedroom in his parents&#x27; home.

When Williams decided to end its line of Lionel Standard gauge and O gauge reproductions, Wolf bought the tooling and continued building the replicas. Although many published reports have stated that Williams had acquired original Lionel tooling, both Wolf and Jerry Williams deny this claim.

From 1983 to 1987, MTH marketed the reproduction trains on its own. In 1987, Lionel approached Samhongsa, MTH&#x27;s subcontractor in South Korea, about manufacturing Standard Gauge trains that bore the Lionel name. Samhongsa directed Lionel to Wolf. Before the end of 1987, MTH became a Lionel subcontractor, allowing MTH&#x27;s Lionel reproductions to bear the Lionel name and be marketed by Lionel itself. As part of the agreement, MTH sold Lionel trains product as part of its mail order business. By the early 1990s, MTH was the second-largest mail-order Lionel dealer in the country.

MTH had a troubled relationship with Lionel that ended in April 1993 when MTH decided to re-enter the market with an O scale model of the General Electric Dash 8 diesel locomotive, which Wolf had first offered to produce for Lionel. Turned down, Wolf decided to market the locomotive himself, citing reduced orders from Lionel for MTH&#x27;s replicas as the reason. Then-Lionel CEO Richard Kughn, who learned of the decision from a flyer at a train show, responded by canceling MTH&#x27;s Lionel dealership. MTH, in turn, filed an anti-trust suit against Lionel, which was settled out of court in 1995. MTH then expanded its product line, adding the former Lionel vintage reproductions, reproductions of equipment from other manufacturers, and new original designs. By 1998, MTH was the largest manufacturer of O gauge trains, eclipsing Lionel&#x27;s market share by approximately $60 million to $50 million. At its peak, MTH employed about 135 people.

MTH also produced many sets of New York City Subway cars, licensed by the MTA, and two sets of Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; cars. Lionel currently holds the MTA license for the NYC Subway cars in O scale while Walthers holds the license in HO scale after acquiring Life-Like. The license transfer is in part due to MTH producing sets covered in graffiti.

MTH and Lionel developed a rivalry similar to that between Lionel and Ives in the 1930s and Lionel and American Flyer in the 1940s and 1950s. Although their train cars are the same size and can operate as part of the same train, the two companies&#x27; locomotives use their own proprietary electronic control systems. MTH uses a system called Digital Command System (DCS), which is capable of operating MTH engines as well as engines using Lionel&#x27;s Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC), used by many other O gauge manufacturers, and Digital Command Control (DCC), which is an open industry standard used by most two-rail scales.

In December 1999, three former employees of Samhongsa rival Korea Brass were convicted of industrial espionage for stealing and using proprietary MTH designs to produce models for Lionel. In April 2000, MTH again sued Lionel, this time for industrial espionage, citing as evidence original electronic drawing files and the precedent set in the South Korean criminal courts. On June 7, 2004, a jury in Detroit, Michigan found Lionel guilty and awarded MTH $40.8 million. The following day, Lionel announced it would appeal the verdict. On December 14, 2006, the judgement was overturned on appeal, citing legal mistakes in the jury trial, and a new trial was ordered.

==Later career==
MTH has also traded lawsuits with Quantum Sound Industries, whose technology is used to add electronic sound to model locomotives from various manufacturers. MTH&#x27;s critics also say the company patented some elements of DCC, which was supposed to be an unencumbered open standard.

As of June 2004, MTH has 57 employees and annual sales of about US$ 40 million. News reports from the fall of 2004 estimated MTH&#x27;s annual sales at closer to $30 million. As a privately held company, MTH does not officially release sales figures. In its 2007 reorganization plan, Lionel estimated MTH&#x27;s annual revenue at about $30 million and stated that MTH is the second-largest manufacturer of O gauge trains in terms of market share.

Although MTH is disliked by Lionel collectors because its reproductions have lowered the market value of all but the most pristine vintage Lionel equipment and disliked by some other hobbyists because of its aggressive marketing and legal tactics, MTH is widely credited with bringing innovations into a hobby that had changed very little since the 1950s as well as lowering prices.

On December 30, 2005, the Union Pacific Railroad sued MTH for using its logos, along with logos of various fallen flag railroads it had acquired, without a license. UP had previously sued other manufacturers, most notably Lionel and Athearn, for the same reason. At the time of the suit, UP had 104 licensees. The suit requested that MTH stop using the trademarks, pay damages, and send UP-branded inventory to the railroad for destruction.

On November 8, 2006 MTH Electric Trains and Union Pacific Railroad announced that they had amicably settled the trademark infringement case that U.P. filed against MTH in the Omaha, Nebraska federal court. The settlement benefits both parties as well the entire model railroad industry, allows Union Pacific to continue to protect its intellectual property, and authorizes MTH’s use of Union Pacific’s trademarks and paint designs on model train products and accessories. Union Pacific has also decided to change its trademark-licensing program so that model railroad manufacturers will no longer have to pay a royalty and will enjoy a perpetual license to use Union Pacific trademarks and paint designs on model railroad products.

In late 2007, Lionel and MTH settled their long-term fight over trade secrets and patent infringements. In March 2008, the court approved a settlement, which has its details under court seal, that includes a one time cash payment to MTH that will take place soon after Lionel exits bankruptcy.

In 2009, Lionel Electric Trains (Lionel, LLC) and MTH Electric Trains began working together under the Lionel Corporation banner. For three decades, MTH Trains had been making Tinplate Reproductions of trains, but did not have the authentic Lionel and American Flyer graphics on the models and boxes. In 2009, the two joined forces, allowing MTH Trains to produce the Lionel tinplate electric trains with the official graphics. The interior electronics are from MTH Electric Trains, but the exterior bears the Lionel Corporation graphics.

In June 2020, it was announced that the CEO, Mike Wolf, will be retiring. Initially, the company was planning to shutdown at the end of May 2021, but since then, the company relocated to 6660 Santa Barbara Road in Elkridge, MD 21075 and continues to produce and market RailKing O Gauge and Premier Line O Scale models with the remaining tooling in its portfolio.

On January 31, 2021, ScaleTrains.com has announced they have acquired MTH&#x27;s HO and S scale tooling.

The licensing agreement between M.T.H. and Lionel LLC to manufacture tinplate trains with the Lionel logo were terminated in 2019. While an option to continue the relationship was proffered, the renewal terms offered by Lionel for an extension beyond 2019 were not conducive for any future M.T.H. tinplate plans.

<text>The term music editor may refer to one of several occupations. In publishing, a music editor is a person who prepares music manuscripts for publication. The use of music editors began at the onset of music publishing in Europe in the late 15th century. In film-making, a music editor is an occupation in which a person assists the music composer in the music recording process, and makes edits to the recorded music track to fit the film&#x27;s cinematography. In journalism, a music editor refers to a news-editor who oversees the news content in relation to the subject of music.

==Music editors in publication==
In publishing, a music editor is an occupation in which a person prepares music manuscripts for publication. This includes proofreading and correcting errors in submitted scores, and may include additional work in adjusting music arrangements, orchestrations, and even sometimes re-composing passages. Music editors may also have input in determining what music is published by a publishing company, and sometimes are members of acquisition committees within a publishing company in which they make value judgments of a work&#x27;s suitability for publication in relation to music quality, music style, and marketability.

Music publishing firms utilize a variety of types of music editors which may be internal to the publishing company itself, or attached to a larger publishing house which contracts with smaller music publishing firms. Many working music editors also work professionally as music arrangers or composers. Most music editors specialize within a particular area of music, such as piano music,choral music, orchestral music, or jazz. Working music editors typically have a university degree in music with a strong background in music theory, music history, and performance practices.

Music editors who work in classical music may have specialized skills. This includes working with documents which are sometimes centuries old, including both handwritten manuscripts and scores which were made by European engravers or early printing presses which do not conform to contemporary music notation and score formatting practices. In these cases, music editors must analyze the scores and transcribe them into modern music notation and formats.

===Early history of the profession===
The use of music editors dates to the very beginning of published music in Europe in the late 15th century; although individuals working in that capacity were usually not named. One of the earliest known music editors was the Venetian Dominican friar Petrus Castellanus (1440–1552) who worked in that capacity for the publisher Ottaviano Petrucci in the first half of the 16th century. The Italian composer Francesco de Layolle was another early known music editor; working in that capacity for the Lyon, France based publisher Jacques Moderne.

==Music editors in film==
In film, a music editor is responsible for assisting the film score composer and making editing decisions in relation to the music track of the film. Their job often involves hiring musicians, taking notes in recording sessions, making suggested cuts, and ultimately editing recorded material to fit the music to the film.

<doc id="712105" wikidata="Q1334499" url="?curid=712105" title="The Great Southern Trendkill">
<text>The Great Southern Trendkill is the eighth studio album by American heavy metal band Pantera, released on May 7, 1996, through Elektra Records and East West Records. It reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and stayed on the chart for 16 weeks. During the album&#x27;s production, Phil Anselmo recorded the vocals alone at Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Studios in New Orleans, while Dimebag Darrell, Rex Brown, and Vinnie Paul recorded the music at Chasin Jason Studios in Dalworthington Gardens. This would be Pantera&#x27;s last studio album to be produced by Terry Date, who had worked with the band since &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; (1990).

==Content==
&quot;Floods&quot;, the album&#x27;s longest song, contains a guitar solo considered by many to be Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s finest. &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine voted it as the 32nd greatest guitar solo of all-time, Darrell&#x27;s highest ranking of three solos to make the list (the other two being his solos from &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, ranked 35th, and &quot;Walk&quot;, ranked 57th).

&quot;10&#x27;s&quot; appears in the English dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Broly – The Legendary Super Saiyan&quot;.

The album is available as downloadable content for the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, with the exception of &quot;Suicide Note Pt. I&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Considered Pantera&#x27;s most aggressive album, the album features elements of thrash metal and death metal, but is mostly considered a groove metal album overall. &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; is known for featuring much screaming, most notably on &quot;Suicide Note Pt. II&quot; and &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; while also featuring some of the fastest tempos and most down-tuned guitars: &quot;The Underground in America&quot; and &quot;(Reprise) Sandblasted Skin&quot;, in particular, were played in A=425 Hz standard D tuning, with the 6th string tuned to a low G. It also has a more experimental nature, such as the acoustic guitars and ballads.

Unlike Pantera&#x27;s first three major label albums, the vocals are often double-tracked and layered to create a more &quot;demonic&quot; effect. An example of this can be heard in the chorus of &quot;13 Steps to Nowhere&quot;, when Phil Anselmo&#x27;s singing voice is backed up by high-pitched screaming, done by Seth Putnam of the band Anal Cunt. Screams done by Anselmo on the song &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; were compared to Putnam.

The lyrical themes on &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; include drugs, a flood that ends mankind, finding deeper meaning, anger, and the media.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from music critics upon release and was more polarizing than Pantera&#x27;s previous albums. Steve Huey of AllMusic gave it a score of 3 out of 5 stars and stated, &quot;Longtime Pantera fans will find plenty to enjoy here, and the band&#x27;s expanding range bodes well, but overall, &quot;Trendkill&quot; is an inconsistent outing.&quot;

In retrospective analysis, the album has often been looked on more favorably, being noted as their heaviest and most aggressive work. In a retrospective review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Saby Reyes-Kulkarni awarded it a score of 7.7/10 and summarized their review by saying &quot;Intended as a rallying cry against shifting trends, Pantera&#x27;s most abrasive album comes off more like a cry for help that reveals the turmoil eating the band from within. It&#x27;s also thrilling.&quot; In 2024, Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Loudwire&quot; stated &quot;&quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; writhes and rails with desperation and self-loathing and roars with a new reservoir of aggression and intensity, making it the heaviest album Pantera ever released.&quot; In 2019, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as the best Pantera album.

==Reissue==
On August 12, 2016, Pantera announced the release of a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; for October 21. The reissue features two discs, including a remastered version of the original album as well as 12 unreleased tracks (these include instrumentals, as well as alternative mixes and live recordings from the Dynamo Festival in 1998). In addition, a separate LP named &quot;The Great Southern Outtakes&quot; was released. It consists of songs also released on disc 2 of &quot;Trendkill&#x27;s&quot; reissue except for the intro and early mix of &quot;Suicide Note Part l&quot;.

<text>Colombey les Deux Églises (, ; before 2017 Colombey-les-Deux-Églises) is a commune in the Haute-Marne department in north-eastern France. It is best known as the home of Charles de Gaulle.

The commune of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises was created administratively in 1793, and it became part of the district of Chaumont and the canton of Blaise. In 1801, under the name Colombey, it passed to the canton Juzennecourt. In January 1973, it absorbed the communes Argentolles, Biernes, Blaise, Champcourt, Harricourt, Pratz and Lavilleneuve-aux-Fresnes. On 1 January 2017, the former commune of Lamothe-en-Blaisy was merged into Colombey-les-Deux-Églises.

Colombey&#x27;s name means &quot;cemetery&quot;, from the Latin &quot;colombarium&quot;. The &quot;two churches&quot; referenced in the name are the parish church, Notre-Dame-en-son-Assomption, and the pre-revolutionary Cluniac priory of Saint-Jean-Baptiste.

==Charles de Gaulle==
Colombey achieved fame as the home and burial site of the 20th-century soldier and statesman Charles de Gaulle, who acquired a substantial property on the southwestern edge of the village in 1934. De Gaulle withdrew repeatedly to Colombey when his political fortunes waned, first on the establishment of the Fourth Republic in 1946, and then between 1953 and 1958, before he became president again at the height of the Algerian Crisis. His final withdrawal to Colombey came in 1969 and he died there the following year. &quot;Colombey&quot; became widely used as a political metaphor for a statesman&#x27;s temporary withdrawal from political life until his country came calling for him again.

De Gaulle is buried in the cemetery in Colombey, in a humble grave with the inscription &quot;Charles de Gaulle 1890-1970&quot;. In addition, a 145 ft (44.3 m) high Cross of Lorraine was built at the western exit of the village, commemorating his distinguished wartime role as commander of the Free French Forces. A memorial museum was inaugurated in October 2008 by Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel. This joint Franco-German act marked the fiftieth anniversary of talks in Colombey on 14 September 1958 between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, as part of the process of post-war reconciliation.

==Geography==
The River Blaise flows through the commune.

== History ==
On September 14, 1958, Charles de Gaulle received Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer on a private visit to La Boisserie.

<doc id="712117" wikidata="Q2607563" url="?curid=712117" title="Namesake">
<text>A namesake is a person, place, or thing bearing the name of another. Most commonly, it refers to an individual who is purposely named after another (e.g. John F. Kennedy Jr would be the namesake of John F. Kennedy). In common , it may mean vice-versa (i.e. referring to the entity for which the second entity is named); in such a case, however, the proper term would be &quot;eponym.&quot;

==History==
The word is first attested around 1635, and probably comes from the phrase &quot;for one&#x27;s name&#x27;s sake&quot;,
which originates in English Bible translations as a rendering of a Hebrew idiom meaning &quot;to protect one&#x27;s reputation&quot; or possibly &quot;vouched for by one&#x27;s reputation.&quot; Examples are in Psalm 23:3, &quot;He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name&#x27;s sake&quot; (King James Bible, 1604), or in the metrical version &quot;e&#x27;en for His own name&#x27;s sake&quot; (Rous 1641, Scottish Psalter 1650, see The Lord&#x27;s My Shepherd).

==Proper usage==
When &quot;namesake&quot; refers to something or someone who is named after something or someone else, the second recipient of a name is usually said to be the &quot;namesake&quot; of the first. This usage usually refers to humans named after other humans, but current usage also allows things to be or have namesakes. Sometimes the first recipient can also be called the &quot;namesake&quot;; however, the correct and unambiguous term would be the &quot;eponym&quot;.

==Family==
Naming a child after a relative, friend, or well-known person is a common practice in the English-speaking world. Continued practise of naming a child after the parent or grandparent may result in several relatives (e.g. cousins) being namesakes of each other despite not having been named after each other.

Among Ashkenazi Jews, it is customary to name a child after a dead relative, such as the child&#x27;s grandparent, but never after a living person. Sephardic Jews traditionally are encouraged to name their children after relatives, living or dead. Greek families traditionally name a child after its paternal grandparents and the second child of the same sex is named after its maternal grandparents.

===Suffixes===

When a son is named after his father, &quot;Jr.&quot;/&quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&#x27;&quot;, or another name suffix may be added to the name of the son (and sometimes &quot;Sr.&quot; or a prior number to the father&#x27;s name), in order to distinguish between individuals, especially if both father and son become famous, as in the case of poet Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and his son, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Sometimes the &quot;Jr.&quot; or &quot;Sr.&quot; suffix is applied even when the child&#x27;s legal name differs from that of the parent. One example is that of the singer Hiram King Williams, known professionally as Hank Williams, and his son Randall Hank Williams, known professionally as Hank Williams Jr. Daughters being named after their mothers using similar suffixes is less common. One example is thoroughbred jockey Rosemary Homeister Jr. whose mother was also a jockey before turning to train. A more archaic method of distinguishing father from son was to follow the name with &quot;the Elder&quot; or &quot;the Younger&quot;, respectively, for example William Pitt the Elder and William Pitt the Younger. For an extensive list, see List of people known as the Elder or the Younger.

==Other uses==
Buildings, such as the Fisher Building, and companies, like the Ford Motor Company, are often named after their founders or owners. Biological species and celestial bodies are frequently named after their discoverers. Alternatively, their discoverers may name them in honor of others. Occasionally, material goods, such as toys or garments, may be named after people closely associated with them in the public mind. The teddy bear, for example, was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, because of a popular story in which the then-President objected to cruel treatment of a bear by hunters.

The fedora hat may be considered the &quot;namesake&quot; of a fictional character, Princess Fédora Romanoff, from an 1887 play, &quot;Fédora&quot;, by Victorien Sardou. In her portrayal of that character, Sarah Bernhardt wore a soft felt hat with a center crease, which became known popularly as a &quot;fedora&quot;.

Several United States military aircraft have served as the namesake of previous aircraft. The Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft was named after the WWII-era Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is the namesake of the McDonnell FH Phantom. Uniquely, the LTV A-7 Corsair II serves as the namesake of both the Vought F4U Corsair and the earlier Vought O2U Corsair, the former also being the namesake of the latter. The newest fighter of the United States, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is the namesake of the United States Army Air Forces twin-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

<doc id="712125" wikidata="Q943879" url="?curid=712125" title="New Helvetia">
<text>New Helvetia (Spanish: Nueva Helvetia), meaning &quot;New Switzerland&quot;, was a 19th-century Alta California settlement and rancho, centered in present-day Sacramento, California.

==Colony of Nueva Helvetia==
The Swiss pioneer John Sutter (1803–1880) arrived in Alta California with other Euro-American settlers in August 1839. He established an agricultural and trading colony, with the stockade Sutter&#x27;s Fort, and named it &quot;Nueva Helvetia&quot;. It was located near the confluence of the Sacramento River and American River. In English the name means &quot;New Switzerland&quot;, after Sutter&#x27;s home country. The design was influenced by Bents Fort operated by the William Bent, which Sutter visited before entering Alta California, Richard.

The site of &quot;Nueva Helvetia&quot; is just a few miles east of where his son, John Sutter, Jr., established Sacramento, and is on the eastern edge of present-day downtown Sacramento.

==Rancho New Helvetia==
Rancho New Helvetia, in Spanish &quot;Rancho Nueva Helvetia&quot;, was a Mexican land grant issued in 1841 by Governor Juan Alvarado to John Sutter. It encompassed lands in present-day Sacramento County, Sutter County, and Yuba County, California.

The grant extended roughly from near present-day Marysville, southwards along the Feather River, to the confluence of the Sacramento River and American River near present-day Sacramento. It was significantly larger than Sutter&#x27;s 1839 Nueva Helvetia colony.

By 1840, the &quot;pueblo&quot; (town) and rancho settlements in Mexican Alta California were primarily located on coastal plains and the inland valleys near them. The Californios were worried about encroachments by foreigners, especially by American immigrants. To serve as a buffer &quot;against their invasion, and &#x27;marauding&#x27; bands of Indians, hunters, and trappers&quot;, Governor Alvarado granted eleven square leagues of land, the maximum under Mexican law, in the lower Sacramento Valley, then in the interior of the territory. Part of Sutter&#x27;s mandate with the grant was to encourage settlers, and he made numerous grants of parcels of land. However, these grants far exceeded the quantity of land ultimately awarded to him.

===Operations===

As many as six hundred Indians worked at New Helvetia during the wheat harvest. Other industries included &quot;a distillery, hat factory, blanket works, and a tannery.&quot; These workers were recruited through local leaders such as Maximo, a Miwok who had sent many workers to Mission San José and Anashe. Housing and working conditions at the fort were very poor, and have been described as &quot;enslavement&quot;, with uncooperative Indians being &quot;whipped, jailed, and executed.&quot; Housing for workers living in nearby villages and rancherías was described as somewhat better.

The settlement was defended by an army of Miwok, Nisenan, and Mission Indians, all consisting of 150 infantry, 50 cavalry, and German-speaking white officers. This group, wearing Russian uniforms purchased from Fort Ross, marched to the Pueblo of Los Angeles area and briefly defended Governor Manuel Micheltorena from the revolt of the Californios.

===Gold Rush===
In January 1848 James W. Marshall found gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill on the rancho, starting the California Gold Rush. Sutter was forced to abandon his business ventures at the settlement after that, when the area was overrun by large numbers of gold-seekers. Sutter&#x27;s Fort is preserved as a California State Historic Park. With the gold rush, Sutter&#x27;s workers abandoned him to seek their fortune in the gold fields. Later, squatters occupied his land. By 1852, Sutter was bankrupt.

===Post-statehood===
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, in 1852 Sutter filed a claim with the Public Land Commission for the eleven square leagues granted by Alvarado in 1841. In 1853 Sutter amended his petition, and claimed an additional 22-square-league &quot;Rancho New Helvetia Sobrante&quot;, granted to him and his son, John A. Sutter Jr., by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1845.

Both grants (New Helvetia and Sobrante) were confirmed by the US District Court in 1857, but the US Attorney General filed an appeal and took the case to the US Supreme Court. Although Sutter could not produce the original records of his grant, the Supreme Court accepted the 1841 Alvarado grant (Rancho New Helvetia) and sent the 1845 Micheltorena grant (Rancho New Helvetia Sobrante) back to the district court. In 1864, the US Supreme Court rejected the 1845 Micheltorena grant (Rancho New Helvetia Sobrante). The eleven square league Alvarado grant was patented to John A. Sutter in 1866.

A claim for part of Rancho New Helvetia was filed by Charles Covillaud, J. M. Ramírez, W. H. Sampson, R. B. Buchanan, and G. N. Sweazy with the Land Commission in 1852. Known as Covillaud &amp; Co., the partners bought Cordua&#x27;s Rancho Honcut, and also bought Cordua&#x27;s leased land on Rancho New Helvetia from Sutter. A claim for Rancho New Helvetia was filed by Roland Gelston with the Land Commission in 1852. Roland Gelston, a San Francisco merchant owned considerable property there and in Sacramento. A claim for part of Rancho New Helvetia as filed by Hiram Grimes, who owned Rancho Del Paso, with the Land Commission in 1853.

For fifteen years following the 1864 US Supreme Court rejection of the Sobrante grant, Sutter tried to obtain reimbursement from Congress for his help in colonizing California. However, little was done.

John Sutter died in 1880, in a hotel in Washington, D.C.

<text>An Advent calendar, from the German word &quot;Adventskalender&quot;, is used to count the days of Advent in anticipation of Christmas. Since the date of the First Sunday of Advent varies, falling between November 27 and December 3 inclusive, many reusable Advent calendars made of paper or wood begin on December 1. Others start from the First Sunday of Advent. 

The Advent calendar was first used by German Lutherans in the 19th and 20th centuries, and has since then spread to other Christian denominations.

==Design and use==

Traditional Advent calendars feature the manger scene, Saint Nicholas and winter weather, while others range in theme, from sports to technology. They come in a multitude of forms, from a simple paper calendar with flaps covering each of the days to fabric pockets on a background scene to painted wooden boxes with cubby holes for small items.

Many Advent calendars take the form of a large rectangular card with flaps (variously referred to as doors or windows), one for each day of December leading up to and including Christmas Eve (December 24) or Christmas Day (December 25). Consecutive doors are opened every day leading up to Christmas, beginning on the start of the Advent season for that year, or simply on December 1, as is the case of reusable Advent calendars. 

Often the doors are distributed across the calendar in no particular order. The calendar doors open to reveal an image, a poem, a portion of a story (such as the story of the Nativity of Jesus), or a small gift, such as a toy or a chocolate item. Often, each door has a Bible verse and Christian prayer printed on it, which Christians incorporate as part of their daily Advent devotions. 

There are many variations of Advent calendars; some European villages create advent calendars on buildings or even so-called &quot;living&quot; Advent calendars, where different windows are decorated for each day of Advent.

== History ==

===Germany - Postwar Period to the present day===

Soon after World War II, the longing for an &quot;ideal world&quot; set in, including the Christmas season. By 1945, Advent calendars were once again being produced in all occupation zones. These calendars were primarily based on sweet designs from around 1930. Some publishers, like Erika in Heidenau, reprinted their older works. Today, these calendars can often only be distinguished from the older copies by the poorer quality of the paper and printing after the war. Returning to old originals was ultimately a matter of costs. In addition, some of the designers who had been active before the war continued to work in this field afterwards. Initially, especially tear-off calendars were popular.

The Richard Sellmer publishing house received the license to print advent calendars in December 1945 in Stuttgart, from their American occupiers. The permission to print 50,000 calendars could be covered via paper from the French occupation zone. Richard Sellmer manufactured the stand-up calendar The little town &quot;Die kleine Stadt&quot; designed by Elisabeth Lörcher. He presented it at the Messe Frankfurt and was looking for US-customers. Even the first calendar was already designed in English and Swedish. The marketing focus on international sales was obvious from the start. Manuals in English and French were already added to the calendars &quot;Alt-Stuttgart&quot; since 1948. US soldiers coming home helped in spreading the calendars which led to Sellmer getting the Major order of 50,000 calendars by an aid organisation for epileptics. After the magazine Newsweek showed a picture of Eisenhower&#x27;s grandson on an Advent calendar in December 1953, demand rose massively. For 1954 the calendar White House was produced, showing the White House as the central design, surrounded by cowboys, prairie schooners and land yachts. This calendar was also specifically commissioned for the US market, just like the Fairy Tales calendar from the same year. Other producers started following the successful trend as well, and so the calendar &quot;Bastelhaus&quot;, or Children Workshop respectively, of Ulla Wittkuhn started showing two different designs for the 24th of December: a Christmas tree and Mary with child for the German children, a burning fireplace for the children of the US.

Between 1946 and 1998 more than 230 various Advent calendars were produced by the Sellmer publishing company. The company is now run as a family business in its third generation. Around 2010, it offered approximately 100 different motifs each year. Many of the calendars reflect the varying traditions of the countries for which they are produced. For instance, calendars for Switzerland leave out St. Nicholas, angels in the U.S. have no wings and religious themes are preferred in the United Kingdom.

Other publishers also resumed production in 1946. For a few years, tear-off calendars were widespread, but by around 1950, they had largely been replaced by calendars with fold-out doors. The Ars Sacra publishing house in Munich produced carefully designed calendars full of small details, always focusing on religious themes. Between 1954 and 1976, Gudrun Keussen was primarily responsible for designing the approximately 30 calendars produced by the publishing house. After the company was renamed arsEdition in 1980, the content shifted from religious themes to family-oriented ones. Calendars designed by East Germans, such as Kurt Brandes and Fritz Baumgarten, were among those printed by the Korsch publishing house in Munich, which was founded in 1951. The Korsch publishing house bought many of its designs from other publishers and still offers many of the older designs today. Korsch also put marketing strategies into practice just like the imprint of firm names. Korsch is one of the most important and most successful publishing houses of its kind.

Supposedly the most popular figure of the conventional Advent calendars was born of a Protestant priest. He adapted the idea of Lang and hid pictures of figures from biblical stories behind 24 little doors. The calendar starting from December 1st with 24 little doors was finally accepted after 1945. Some calendars had more than one little door per date, with the 24 December often among them. The Advent Sundays could also have additional windows, in particular when they were out of the 24 days. &quot;The Secret of Christimas&quot;, a calendar designed by Paula Jordan, is a so-called &quot;Three Kings&#x27; calendar&quot; and even extended to the Epiphany (6th of January). These calendars were offered by religious publishers in particular and were sold up until the 1960s. Since 1995, &quot;Der Andere Advent&quot; was published by the ecumenical organization &quot;Andere Zeiten&quot; and is again an Advent calendar which follows the ecclesiastical year and therefore extends to the 6th of January. Since 2017, &quot;Der Andere Advent&quot; has an edition for children between the age of 7 and 11 which includes stories, experiments, comics and games.

This Advent calendar gained nationwide popularity in the 1950s, when it was a mass-produced article that was offered at an affordable price. The designs were mainly scenes from romantic, snow-covered little towns. The big window of the 24th of December usually hid a crib scene. There were also hand-painted advent calendars by various artists, one example being the Advent calendars of Leipzig.

==The Nordic Julekalender/Julkalender==

In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, there is a tradition of having a &quot;Julekalender&quot; (Swedish: &quot;Julkalender&quot;, Finnish: &quot;Joulukalenteri&quot;, Icelandic: &quot;Jóladagatal&quot;; the local word for a Yule—or Christmas—calendar) in the form of a television or radio show, starting on December 1 and ending on Christmas Eve (December 24).

The first such show aired on radio in 1957 in the form of the Swedish radio series &quot;Barnens adventskalender&quot;. The first televised show of the genre aired in 1960 in the form of the Swedish program &quot;Titteliture&quot;. The first &quot;julekalender&quot; aired in Denmark was &quot;Historier fra hele verden&quot; in 1962. The televised &quot;julkalender&quot; or &quot;julekalendar&quot; has now extended into the other Nordic countries. In Finland, for example, the show is called &quot;Joulukalenteri&quot;.

Over the years, there have been several kinds of &quot;julekalender&quot;. Some are directed at children, some at both children and adults, and some directed at adults alone. There is a &quot;Julkalender&quot; radio show in Sweden, which airs in the days leading up to Christmas. A classic example of a &quot;julekalender&quot; enjoyed by children, as well as adults, if purely for nostalgic reasons, is the 1979 Norwegian television show &quot;Jul i Skomakergata&quot;. Another is the 1990 Icelandic television show &quot;Á baðkari til Betlehem&quot;.

<text>The water polo competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia saw Hungary’s return to the gold medal platform and the introduction of the women’s tournament. The Australian women had lobbied the IOC hard for the inclusion of women’s water polo in the Olympics, including showing up at the airport dressed only in their swimsuits during one pre-Olympic visit by members of the IOC.

Six nations competed in the women’s tournament with home team Australia winning the gold medal over the United States. Twelve nations competed in the men’s tournament and played a total of 48 matches. Spain was unable to follow up their 1996 gold medal performance with a medal. Hungary defeated Russia for the gold medal. The matches were held at Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre and the Sydney Olympic Aquatic Centre.

<text>Funnel cake (Pennsylvania German: &quot;Drechderkuche&quot;) is a regional sweet food popular in North America, found mainly at carnivals and amusement parks. It is made by deep-frying batter.

==History==
The concept of the funnel cake dates back to the early medieval Persian and Arab world as &quot;zalabiyeh&quot;, where similar yeast-risen dishes were first prepared, and later spread to Europe. Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants brought the yeast dish, known as &quot;drechderkuche&quot;, to America, and around 1879, they developed the baking powder version along with its new name, funnel cake.

== Preparation ==
Funnel cakes are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil in a circular pattern and deep frying the overlapping mass until golden-brown. The batter is commonly poured through a funnel, creating its texture and giving it its name. When made at concession stands, a pitcher with an integral funnel spout is employed. Alton Brown recommends they be made with choux pastry, which expands from steam produced by its high water content.

Funnel cakes are typically served plain with powdered sugar but can also be served with jam/jelly, cinnamon, chocolate, fresh fruit, or other toppings.

==Cultural variations==
===Europe===
In south German cuisine, the equivalent is called &quot;Strauben&quot; or &quot;Strieble&quot; and is made and served similarly. In Finnish cuisine, the analogous &quot;tippaleipä&quot; (literally droplet bread) is traditionally served at May Day (Vappu) celebrations, alongside sima. In Lithuania, it is called &quot;skruzdėlynas&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;ant nest&quot;. It is normally made in early spring to empty last year&#x27;s honey stock and make more space for the new one, and it is also made at the first harvest of honey. The Armenian equivalent &quot;mrjnabujn&quot; (:hy:Մրջնաբույն (տորթ)) also translates to &quot;ant nest&quot;.

===Asia===
In the Indian subcontinent, a similar dessert, with a crystallized sugary exterior coating, is called jalebi. In Iran, this is known as &quot;zulbia&quot; and is a popular dessert. These differ from funnel cake in using no baking powder, which results in a somewhat chewy texture.

Kumukunsi is another similar native doughnut from the Maguindanao people in the Philippines. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. They have the taste and consistency of creamy pancakes.

===United States===
In the U.S., funnel cakes were originally associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch Country. It is one of the first North American fried foods, which is associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch, German immigrants who came to Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, it is a staple dish that can be found at amusement parks and fairs all over the country. The name &quot;funnel&quot; later came from the technique used to make the cakes, in which the pancake-like batter is poured into hot oil through a funnel.

<doc id="712164" wikidata="Q2885861" url="?curid=712164" title="Bart King">
<text>John Barton &quot;Bart&quot; King (October 19, 1873 – October 17, 1965) was an American cricketer, active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King was part of the Philadelphia team that played from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I. This period of cricket in the United States was dominated by &quot;gentlemen cricketers&quot;—men of independent wealth who did not need to work. King, an amateur from a middle-class family, was able to devote time to cricket thanks to a job set up by his teammates.

A skilled batsman who proved his worth as a bowler, King set numerous records in the continent of North America during his career and led the first-class bowling averages in England in 1908. He successfully competed against the best cricketers from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called the &quot;angler&quot;, and helped develop the art of swing bowling in the sport. Sir Pelham Warner described Bart King as &quot;one of the finest bowlers of all time&quot;, and Donald Bradman called him &quot;America&#x27;s greatest cricketing son.&quot;

==Early and personal life==
King was born in Philadelphia on October 19, 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the insurance industry. King was not a member of the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era&#x27;s top cricketers. King&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Cricket Quarterly&quot; suggests that his career in insurance was set up for him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted for fifty years. King&#x27;s wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday.

Bart King was regarded by many of his contemporaries as an affable person. Ralph Barker called him the Bob Hope of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was also noted for making jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing at themselves. The same held true when he would question umpires that turned down his appeals. He is said to have spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner during his last tour to England, punctuated every few seconds with laughs. The dinner guests were kept laughing even while King spoke with a dead-pan expression. One man who attended the dinner noted that King &quot;told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction ... that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction.&quot;

Arthur Mailey described him as a &quot;tall, beautifully built, American Adonis.&quot;

==Cricketing career==

Like most young American men of this era, Bart King came to cricket only after first playing baseball. He began to play club cricket at Tioga Cricket Club in 1888, aged 15, starting out as a batsman. Tioga was one of the lesser Philadelphian cricket clubs. King played his first recorded match for the club in 1889, when he was tried as a bowler due to his physique. He took 37 wickets for 99 runs for the club in the 1889 cricket season.

King played for Tioga until 1896, when he joined Belmont Cricket Club. King joined the Philadelphian cricket team for three tours of England while playing at Belmont. King&#x27;s most dominating matches came during these tours, playing with the premier American team of the era.

===Australia in Philadelphia===
In 1893, the Australian team stopped by Philadelphia on its way home from a tour of England. Australia fielded a strong side, but the team was tired after a long tour and trip. In spite of this fatigue, the Australians chose to face the full strength of the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in a three-day match starting September 29.

On a small ground at Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled so that the ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, allowing the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King&#x27;s developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.

The cricket world was stunned that a single American city could turn out a side capable of beating the full strength of Australia. The Australians won the return match on October 6 by six wickets, but the Australian captain, Jack Blackham, said to the Americans, &quot;You have better players here than we have been led to believe. They class with England&#x27;s best.&quot;

===Tour of England in 1897===
King won the Child&#x27;s Bowling Cup, the premier award for bowling in American cricket, for the first time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team&#x27;s tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was arranged mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field.

While the tour initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. King demonstrated his batting ability in the first innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 107 with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs, and Philadelphia dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. King took 6 for 102 in Sussex&#x27;s second innings, helping the Philadelphians to victory by 8 wickets.

Despite the excitement surrounding King&#x27;s performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, and the results may have been worse than hoped for by the tour&#x27;s promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more than anyone else in the team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.

Following the 1897 tour, many English counties were interested in securing King&#x27;s services. It was thought that he would not play as a professional, so alternative means of remuneration had to be found: one county reportedly offered to arrange a marriage with a widow who had an income of £7000 per year. In the end, King returned to the United States, where he continued to perform very well in club cricket.

===Tour of England in 1903===
The Philadelphian team returned to England in 1903. This proved to be King&#x27;s most successful tour, particularly his performances in the matches against Lancashire and Surrey. King played in 13 of the 15 matches on the tour, missing two with a strained side. In his first match, against Cambridge University, he took 5 for 136 and 4 for 28. He followed that with 8 for 39 in the first innings against Oxford University, though the match was eventually abandoned as a draw due to rain. In his next match, against Gloucestershire, he took 2 for 26 in the first innings but did not bowl in the second. He also took 7 for 51 and 2 for 28 against a strong MCC side at Lord&#x27;s. Then came the Lancashire match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

In Lancashire&#x27;s first innings, King bowled 27 overs and took 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire&#x27;s first innings score, but their lead was quickly overtaken in Lancashire&#x27;s second innings. With the wind strong over King&#x27;s left shoulder, the scene was set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire&#x27;s opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a stump out of the ground in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets.

Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It was in this match that King gave what Barker called his finest first-class performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian&#x27;s first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey&#x27;s reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.

===Tour of England in 1908===
King toured England with the Philadelphians a third time in 1908. This tour included both first-class matches and more minor ones. The first match that was played was against South Wales in Cardiff. The Philadelphians won by 36 behind the bowling of King and Ranji Hordern. The pair took all 20 wickets of the Welsh side. After this, the first-class matches began with Worcestershire on July 9. Again the Philadelphians won and again Hordern and King took most of the wickets. This trend continued throughout the tour. In the first-class matches that King played, the Philadelphians recorded four wins and six losses. Although he was already 35 years old, King had posted extraordinary numbers in his bowling. He topped the bowling averages for the entire 1908 English cricket season at 11.01. This mark was not bettered until 1958, when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99.

===Later career===
King&#x27;s cricketing career did not end with his last first-class match. He continued to play club matches in Philadelphia and participated in non-first-class fixtures around the continent. King is noted for holding the bowling record against Canada. On a rainy afternoon at Philadelphia in 1906, King bowled into a slight breeze to capture 8 wickets for 17 runs. This record came in a four-year period during which King focused on club cricket in Philadelphia, when he won the city&#x27;s batting award three times and the bowling award four times.

King played in his last two international matches in 1912, against Australia. His performances were of the highest quality, given that he was nearing his fortieth year. In the first match, he took 9 wickets for 78 runs to help Philadelphia win by 2 runs; in the second, Australia won by 45 runs despite him taking 8 for 74.

King joined the Philadelphia Cricket Club after the 1912 season. Despite being well past his 40th year, he continued to play competitive cricket for another 4 years. His 27-year career ended with his last game for the Philadelphia Cricket Club against Frankford, on July 20, 1916. On this occasion, his bowling and batting skills had declined, but he maintained a batting average of 43.33 for that final season.

==Death==
King died at a nursing home in his native Philadelphia in 1965, two days short of his 92nd birthday. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in the UK ran an obituary for him, which quoted Plum Warner as saying that: &quot;Had he been an Englishman or an Australian, he would have been even more famous than he was.&quot;

==Achievements and legacy==

Though King focused on bowling throughout his career, he was also a very fine batsman. In 1905, he established a North American record batting record by scoring 315 at the Germantown Cricket Club. The following year, he scored 344 not out for Belmont against the Merion Cricket Club, setting a North American batting record which still stands. He scored 39 centuries in his North American career, and he topped 1,000 runs in six seasons. He took over 100 wickets in eight seasons, including a double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in four seasons. In his whole career, he scored 19,808 runs at an average of 36.47, and took 2,088 wickets at an average of 10.47. He took all 10 wickets in an innings on three occasions, and took 9 wickets in an innings five times. One of these occasions, in the Gentlemen of Ireland&#x27;s first innings in 1909, was followed by a hat-trick in the second innings.

There is an apocryphal story of King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders back into the pavilion and finishing off the opponent&#x27;s innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling one of them to a position back and to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark &quot;angler&quot;. This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he &quot;went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over.&quot; He claimed to have &quot;hit the first delivery to cover point but of course there was no one there. The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six.&quot; The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.

Thanks to his dominant performance over his career and his renown in the world of cricket, King was elected an honorary member of the Incogniti Cricket Club in 1908 and an honorary life member of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1962. When Plum Warner was asked to name the greatest bowler who ever lived, he said that John Barton King, &quot;at the top of his power and speed, was at least the equal of the greatest of them all.&quot;

King is credited as one of the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could sometimes get the ball to swing, but King was one of the first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the &quot;angler&quot;, a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would come in with the ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing—in and out—and would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said &quot;the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but it was the fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen.&quot;

<text>The Wallowa Mountains () are a mountain range located in the Columbia Plateau of northeastern Oregon in the United States. The range runs approximately northwest to southeast in southwestern Wallowa County and eastern Union County between the Blue Mountains to the west and the Snake River to the east. The range is sometimes considered to be an eastern spur of the Blue Mountains, and it is known as the &quot;Alps of Oregon&quot;. Much of the range is designated as the Eagle Cap Wilderness, part of the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest.

==Geography==
The range is drained by the Wallowa River, which flows from the north side of the mountains, and its tributary the Minam River, which flows through the west side of the range. The Imnaha River flows from the east side of the range.

The highest point in the range is Sacajawea Peak, which is above sea level. Sacajawea is the sixth highest mountain in Oregon and the state&#x27;s highest peak outside of the Cascade Range.

==Geology==
Many geologists believe that the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon are a displaced fragment of the Insular Belt. The core of the Wallowas is composed of the Wallowa Batholith surrounded by Columbia River basalt. In addition there are many older terranes between the batholith and basalt flows.

The Wallowa Batholith is formed of granite from a magma upwelling in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time (between 160 million and 120 million years ago). The placement of this rock caused uplift of the surface, which at the time was tropical sea. This is evident from the slate, quartzite, and marble present in the mountains, which come from metamorphism of the sedimentary deposits of oceans during the Triassic. At the center of the Batholith are granodioritic rocks, while the outer limits of the range are tonalitic. The granite batholith is cut by dikes; however, these are uncommon.

Glaciers carved out the valleys during the late Pleistocene, which left a number of moraines. The series of moraines is formed by a series of glacial advances and retreats. Glacial till is also a common feature of the valleys. The melting of the glaciers produced a large quantity of water, which carried sediment to the valley bottoms, leaving delta deposits on top of the former deposits.

==Climate==
In the mountains, much precipitation falls as snow. Total snowfall peaks around March. Most precipitation in the area is orographic precipitation. Near the tops of the mountains, total annual precipitation can exceed per year, while in the valleys it can be as low as .

===Avalanches===
The Wallowa Mountains are a popular destination for backcountry skiers and snowmobilers. However, avalanches are a consistent threat to backcountry skiers and snowmobilers.

In February 2014, two backcountry skiers were killed and two others were serious injured in the southern Wallowas on Cornucopia Peak when an avalanche swept into a mountainside gully. On 8 March 2016, the local avalanche center director, Kip Rand, was killed backcountry skiing near the Hurwal Divide and Chief Joseph Mountain in an avalanche following the collapse of a large cornice.

==Ecology==
The higher precipitation of the mountains compared with the surrounding country has created a mesic habitat in the Wallowas. Vegetation in the region contains combinations of plants found in both the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades. At low elevations, Douglas fir is the most common tree for slopes, whereas Engelmann spruce and lodgepole pine occur in valley bottoms, with grand fir common below . In meadows and around springs and seeps, willows and sedge grow. Above , subalpine fir is dominant, and whitebark pine is often found on ridges and south-facing slopes.

==Human history==

The area was home to the Wallowa band of the Lower Nez Perce. The Nez Perce lived in the canyons and burned trees to create meadows for the horses that they obtained around 1730. In 1834, Captain Bonneville crossed through the mountains and met with the lower Nez Perce on his way to Fort Walla Walla. In the 1840s, people began to move west, bringing settlers through the land. The Nez Perce began to trade with these settlers. A settlement in the mountains was built in 1861. In 1863, a new treaty was signed that relinquished lands that granted by an 1855 treaty, turning them over to the American government. This same year, the settlers in the mountains moved to present-day La Grande. These lands included the Wallowa Valley, home of Chief Joseph. The government first opened the Wallowa Valley to settlement in 1867. Surveyors began to come through and would continue until 1869. The Wallowa Valley was partitioned in 1873, with one half for the Nez Perce and the other for settlers. Two years later, in 1875, the government banned the Nez Perce from the valley. The first road into the valley, a toll road, was constructed the same year. The U.S. Government attempted to force the removal of the Nez Perce in 1877; however, this angered the natives, who chose instead to raid the settlers, leading to the Nez Perce War.

Logging came in the late 1880s, using streams and rivers to transport the wood. A dam was constructed on Wallowa Lake in 1884 to help irrigate the valley. In 1908, the first railroad into the valley was completed. Rail lines were built to the upper valley by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1919, allowing for safer transportation of logs. The dam beneath Wallowa Lake was replaced by a concrete dam in 1916, and a new dam was completed in 1929.

<text>In number theory, a Wagstaff prime is a prime number of the form
:formula_1

where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime. Wagstaff primes are named after the mathematician Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr.; the prime pages credit François Morain for naming them in a lecture at the Eurocrypt 1990 conference. Wagstaff primes appear in the New Mersenne conjecture and have applications in cryptography.

== Examples ==

The first three Wagstaff primes are 3, 11, and 43 because
:formula_2

== Known Wagstaff primes ==

The first few Wagstaff primes are:
:3, 11, 43, 683, 2731, 43691, 174763, 2796203, 715827883, 2932031007403, 768614336404564651, ... {{OEIS|id=A000979}}

Exponents which produce Wagstaff primes or probable primes are:
:3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31, 43, 61, 79, 101, 127, 167, 191, 199, 313, 347, 701, 1709, 2617, 3539, 5807, ... {{OEIS|A000978}}

== Generalizations ==
It is natural to consider more generally numbers of the form
:formula_3
where the base formula_4. Since for formula_5 odd we have
:formula_6
these numbers are called &quot;Wagstaff numbers base formula_7&quot;, and sometimes considered a case of the repunit numbers with negative base formula_8.

For some specific values of formula_7, all formula_10 (with a possible exception for very small formula_5) are composite because of an &quot;algebraic&quot; factorization. Specifically, if formula_7 has the form of a perfect power with odd exponent (like 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, 343, 512, 729, 1000, etc. {{OEIS|id=A070265}}), then the fact that formula_13, with formula_14 odd, is divisible by formula_15 shows that formula_16 is divisible by formula_17 in these special cases. Another case is formula_18, with &quot;k&quot; a positive integer (like 4, 64, 324, 1024, 2500, 5184, etc. {{OEIS|id=A141046}}), where we have the aurifeuillean factorization.

However, when formula_7 does not admit an algebraic factorization, it is conjectured that an infinite number of formula_5 values make formula_10 prime, notice all formula_5 are odd primes.

For formula_23, the primes themselves have the following appearance: 9091, 909091, 909090909090909091, 909090909090909090909090909091, … {{OEIS|id=A097209}}, and these &quot;n&quot;s are: 5, 7, 19, 31, 53, 67, 293, 641, 2137, 3011, 268207, ... {{OEIS|id=A001562}}.

See Repunit#Repunit primes for the list of the generalized Wagstaff primes base formula_7. (Generalized Wagstaff primes base formula_7 are generalized repunit primes base formula_8 with odd formula_5)

The least primes &quot;p&quot; such that formula_28 is prime are (starts with &quot;n&quot; = 2, 0 if no such &quot;p&quot; exists)
:3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3, 7, 3, 3, 7, 3, 17, 5, 3, 3, 11, 7, 3, 11, 0, 3, 7, 139, 109, 0, 5, 3, 11, 31, 5, 5, 3, 53, 17, 3, 5, 7, 103, 7, 5, 5, 7, 1153, 3, 7, 21943, 7, 3, 37, 53, 3, 17, 3, 7, 11, 3, 0, 19, 7, 3, 757, 11, 3, 5, 3, ... {{OEIS|id=A084742}}

The least bases &quot;b&quot; such that formula_29 is prime are (starts with &quot;n&quot; = 2)
:2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 16, 61, 2, 6, 10, 6, 2, 5, 46, 18, 2, 49, 16, 70, 2, 5, 6, 12, 92, 2, 48, 89, 30, 16, 147, 19, 19, 2, 16, 11, 289, 2, 12, 52, 2, 66, 9, 22, 5, 489, 69, 137, 16, 36, 96, 76, 117, 26, 3, ... {{OEIS|id=A103795}}

<text>Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics was the third time an Olympic baseball tournament had been held as a full medal sport, and the ninth time it had been part of the Summer Olympic Games in any capacity. It was held in Sydney, Australia from 17 September through to the bronze and gold medal games on 27 September. Two venues were used for the Games: the Sydney Baseball Stadium and Blacktown Olympic Park. For the first time in Olympic competition, professional baseball players were eligible to participate, though no active players from Major League Baseball were available.

In the gold medal game known as the &quot;Miracle on Grass&quot;, the United States became Olympic Champions for the first time in its baseball history by defeating Cuba 4–0. Since becoming a medal sport, it was the first time Cuba had not won the gold medal. The gold medal game was also only the second game Cuba had lost in Olympic baseball, having lost to the Netherlands earlier in the tournament. South Korea won their first Olympic baseball medal, beating Japan in the bronze medal match 3–1.

== Format ==
The main tournament featured eight teams. These teams were selected from a series of continental qualifying tournaments, with the exception of Australia who qualified automatically as hosts. As had been the case at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two teams each qualified from the Americas via the 1999 Pan American Games, Asia via the 1999 Asian Baseball Championship, and Europe via the 1999 European Baseball Championship. The final spot went to the winner of a deciding series between the African and Oceania champions, as determined by the 1999 All-Africa Games and the 1999 Oceania Baseball Championship respectively. This playoff was won by South Africa, who swept Guam in a best-of-five series in Johannesburg in December 1999.

The eight teams met in a round-robin series, facing each other once. The top four teams from this then met in the finals, with the first and fourth placed teams playing against each other in one semi final, and the second and third placed teams in the other. The losers of these semi finals competed in the bronze medal game, while the winners met in the gold medal game.

<text>Charles François de Broglie, [[Marquis]] of Ruffec (19 August 1719 – 16 August 1781), was a French soldier and diplomat from the House of Broglie.

He served in the French Army and was one of the foremost diplomats in the service of Louis XV. He is chiefly remembered in connection with the &quot;Secret du Roi&quot;.

==Biography==
As second son of François-Marie, duc de Broglie, he was accorded the courtesy title of &quot;marquis de Ruffec&quot;.

After serving as a French military officer, he was seconded to the diplomatic service of King Louis XV. He served as Ambassador Extraordinary to Poland (1752–56), was recalled at the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, was appointed &quot;Chevalier des Ordres du Roi&quot; (1757), Lieutenant-General (1760), Commandant of Franche-Comté (1761–62), then after the Peace, Governor of Saumurois (1770). He is best remembered in connection with the &quot;Secret du Roi&quot;, the private—as distinct from the official—diplomatic service of Louis XV, of which he was the ablest and most important member. He held the post of &quot;Premier Colonel&quot; of Grenadiers.

The Marquis organized the famous &quot;Diner de Metz&quot; (8 August 1775), when the young Marquis de La Fayette was convinced by the guest of honour, the visiting Duke of Gloucester, brother of King George III, that the insurgents&#x27; revolt in America was in some measure justified. Broglie-Ruffec was involved with Beaumarchais in devising a scheme to offer secret support to the American Revolution in its early stages.

His funeral monument is in the Angouleme Cathedral and a portrait of him, painted by Norman-Michel-Hubert Descours in 1762, is at the Château de Bourdeilles.

==Marriage==
He married, 21 March 1759, Louise Augustine de Montmorency (1735–1817); they had three daughters. 
==Children==

# Louise (1760–1827)
#Philippine de Broglie (1762–1843) 
#Adelaide Charlotte de Broglie 1763–1847.

<doc id="712171" wikidata="Q1167700" url="?curid=712171" title="Takeo Doi">
<text>was a Japanese academic, psychoanalyst and author.

==Early life==
Doi was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1920. He was a graduate of the University of Tokyo.

==Career==
Doi was Professor Emeritus in the Department of Neuropsychiatry at the University of Tokyo and a medical adviser to St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital in Tokyo. He was also Director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Japan. He taught at the University of Tokyo (1971-1980) and at International Christian University (1980-1982). He wrote numerous books and articles both in Japanese and in English.

Doi was best known for his influential explanation of contemporary Japanese society in the work &quot;The Anatomy of Dependence&quot;, published in 1971, which focused extensively on —inner feelings and behaviors that show individual&#x27;s innate desires to be understood and taken care of—as a psychoanalytical concept and theory. &quot;The Anatomy of Dependence&quot; was described by Harvard professor emeritus Ezra Vogel as &quot;the first book by a Japanese trained in psychiatry to have an impact on Western psychiatric thinking.&quot; His work has been categorized as &quot;nihonjinron&quot;.

In 1986, Doi published a further book, &quot;The Anatomy of Self&quot;, that expanded on his previous analysis of the concept of by a deeper examination of the distinctions between and (inner feelings and public display); (home) and (outside); and (front) and (rear) and suggests that these constructs are important for understanding the Japanese psyche as well as Japanese society.

Doi died aged 89 in 2009.

<text>Galina Pavlovna Vishnevskaya (, Ivanova, Иванова; 25 October 1926 – 11 December 2012) was a Russian soprano opera singer and recitalist who was named a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1966. She was the wife of cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and mother to their two daughters, Olga and Elena Rostropovich.

==Biography==
Vishnevskaya was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). She made her professional stage debut in 1944 singing operetta. After a year studying with Vera Nikolayevna Garina, she won a competition held by the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow (with Rachmaninoff&#x27;s song &quot;O, Do Not Grieve&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s aria &quot;O patria mia&quot; from &quot;Aida&quot;) in 1952. The next year, she became a member of the Bolshoi Theatre.

On 24 March 1957, she made her debut in Finnish National Opera as Tatyana in Eugene Onegin. On 9 May 1960, she made her first appearance in Sarajevo at the National Theatre, as Aida. In 1961, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Aida; the following year she made her debut at the Royal Opera House with the same role. For her La Scala debut in 1964, she sang Liù in &quot;Turandot&quot;, opposite Birgit Nilsson and Franco Corelli.

In addition to the roles in the Russian operatic repertoire, Vishnevskaya also sang roles such as Violetta, Tosca, Cio-cio-san, Leonore, and Cherubino.

Benjamin Britten wrote the soprano role in his War Requiem (completed 1962) specially for her, though the USSR prevented her from traveling to Coventry Cathedral for the premiere performance. The USSR eventually allowed her to leave in order to make the first recording of the Requiem.

Vishnevskaya was married to the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich from 1955 until his death in 2007; they performed together regularly (he on piano or on the podium). Both she and Rostropovich were friends of Dmitri Shostakovich, and they made an electrifying recording of his opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; for EMI. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a friend and an ally in various causes, lived at their dacha for about three years from 1968, at a time when he was closely watched by the KGB and had become an official non-person; the home of the two acclaimed musicians offered safety and freedom from the risk of being spied on at home. 
In 1974, the couple asked the Soviet government for an extended leave and left the Soviet Union. Eventually they settled in the United States and Paris. In 1982, the soprano bade farewell to the opera stage, in Paris, as Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. In 1987, she stage directed Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot; in Washington, D.C. In 1984, Vishnevskaya published a memoir, &quot;Galina: A Russian Story&quot; (). With her husband, Mstislav Rostropovich, she founded the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation, a publicly supported nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C., in 1991 to improve the health and future of children in the former Soviet Union. In 2002, she opened her own opera theatre in Moscow, the &quot;Galina Vishnevskaya Opera Centre&quot;.

In 2006, she was featured in Alexander Sokurov&#x27;s documentary &quot;Elegy of a life: Rostropovich, Vishnevskaya&quot;. In 2007, she starred in his film &quot;Alexandra&quot;, playing the role of a grandmother coming to see her grandson in the Second Chechen War. The film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>Jerry Gustave Hasford (November 28, 1947 – January 29, 1993), also known under his pen name Gustav Hasford, was an American novelist, journalist and poet. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Short-Timers&quot; (1979) was the basis for the film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987). He was a United States Marine Corps veteran, who served as a war correspondent during the Vietnam War.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Russellville, Alabama, Hasford joined the United States Marine Corps in 1966 and served as a combat correspondent during the Vietnam War. As a military journalist, he wrote stories for &quot;Leatherneck Magazine&quot;, &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot;, and &quot;Sea Tiger&quot;. During his tour in Vietnam, Hasford was awarded the Navy &amp; Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Valor Device, during the Battle of Huế in 1968.

===Early literary career===
Hasford attended the Clarion Workshop and associated with various science fiction writers of the 1970s, including Arthur Byron Cover and David J. Skal. He had works published in magazines and anthologies such as &quot;Space and Time&quot; and Damon Knight&#x27;s &quot;Orbit&quot; series. He also published the poem &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; in a 1972 edition of &quot;Winning Hearts and Minds&quot;, the first anthology of writing about the war by veterans. The poem was reprinted in &quot;Carrying the Darkness&quot; in 1985.

===&quot;The Short-Timers&quot;===
In 1978, Hasford attended the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop and met veteran science fiction author Frederik Pohl, who was then an editor at Bantam Books. At Pohl&#x27;s suggestion, Hasford submitted &quot;The Short-Timers&quot;, and Pohl promptly bought it for Bantam.

&quot;The Short-Timers&quot; was published in 1979 and became a best-seller, described in &quot;Newsweek&quot; as &quot;[t]he best work of fiction about the Vietnam War&quot;. It was adapted into the feature film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), directed by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Hasford, Kubrick, and screenwriter Michael Herr was nominated for an Academy Award. Hasford&#x27;s actual contributions were a subject of dispute among the three, and ultimately Hasford chose not to attend the Oscar ceremonies.

===Library books theft charges===
In 1985, Hasford had borrowed 98 books from the Sacramento, California, public library but never returned them. An arrest warrant for misdemeanor grand theft was issued, but local authorities were unable to find him. In March 1988, shortly before the Academy Awards ceremony, campus police from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, found nearly 10,000 library books in his rented storage locker. At that time, he had 87 overdue books and five years of &quot;Civil War Times&quot; magazine issues checked out from the Cal Poly-SLO library; the materials were initially valued at $3,000 (they were later revalued at $20,000). 

Hasford&#x27;s book collection included books borrowed (and never returned) from dozens of libraries across the United States, from libraries in Australia and the United Kingdom, and, allegedly, books taken from the homes of acquaintances. Among them were 19th-century books on Edgar Allan Poe and the American Civil War. Hasford had obtained borrowing privileges at Cal Poly-SLO as a California resident, using the residential address of a motel near campus and a false Social Security number.

In June 1988, he was charged with two counts of grand theft and ten counts of possession of stolen property. Judge Harry Woolpert of the San Luis Obispo County Superior Court scheduled the trial hearings to begin on December 5. During the trial, Hasford rearranged to plead guilty to possession of stolen property. On January 4, 1989, Hasford was sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment (of which he served three months) and promised to pay $1,100 in restitution from the royalties of his future works. He was also ordered to pay the shipping costs for the return of 748 books to nine libraries throughout the United States.

In a form letter addressed to friends and family, Hasford claimed that he wanted the books to research a never-published book on the Civil War. He described his difficulties as &quot;a vicious attack launched against me by Moral Majority fanatics backed up by the full power of the Fascist State.&quot;

===Second and third novels===
In 1990, he published a second novel, &quot;The Phantom Blooper&quot;, which was a sequel to &quot;The Short-Timers&quot;. The sequel was intended to be the second installment of a &quot;Vietnam Trilogy&quot;, but Hasford died before writing the third installment. Hasford&#x27;s final novel titled &quot;A Gypsy Good Time&quot;, a hardboiled, noir detective story set in Los Angeles, was published in 1992.

===Later life and death===
Hasford, impoverished and suffering from untreated diabetes, moved to the Greek island of Aegina and died there of heart failure on 29 January 1993, aged 45. He is interred at Winston Memorial Cemetery in Haleyville, Alabama.

<text>The Red Mercury&quot;Zinnoberrote Merkur&quot;, lit. &quot;vermilion Mercury&quot;is the rarest of Austrian newspaper stamps. It was issued for the mailing of newspapers in Austria and Lombardy-Venetia.

==History==
Austria&#x27;s newspaper stamps first appeared in 1851. They depicted a profile of Mercury, the Roman messenger god, and were not denominated, the color of the stamp indicating the value. Blue indicated the 6/10 kreuzer rate for one newspaper, yellow for ten newspapers (6 kr), and rose for 50 newspapers (30 kr). The higher denominations franked wrappers of bundles of newspapers and were frequently discarded.

In 1856 a red, or scarlet, stamp with the Mercury design, sold for six kreuzer - 30 centesimi to frank a bundle of 10 newspapers, was issued. However, it was soon superseded by a new design depicting Franz Joseph which came out in 1858, and only a few copies have survived.

==Valuations==
An unused copy, without gum and short at the left side, was auctioned for 23,000 DM by Grobe &amp; Lange in 1996. Recent auctions have valued it at about US$40,000. The 2005 Yvert catalog values it at €60,000 (75,000 if used).

On 7 February 2008 an unused copy was auctioned in Vienna for 26,000 euros.

An unused Red Mercury with original gum was auctioned for a hammer price of €40,000 plus commission, by Auktionhaus Felzmann in Düsseldorf on 5 November 2015.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Iceland on Saturday, 26 June 2004.

Traditionally, Icelandic presidential elections in which the incumbent president indicates a wish to obtain a new mandate are uncontested. The incumbent president, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, was first elected in 1996 with 41.4% of the vote, in an election with an 85.9% turnout contested by four candidates. In 2000 he was re-elected without opposition. When Ólafur Ragnar announced his intention to seek another mandate in 2004, two other candidates emerged:
:Ástþór Magnússon, a businessman and peace activist, who won 2.6% of the vote in the 1996 election and failed to obtain the necessary 1,500 supporters when he attempted to stand in the 2000 election, and
:Baldur Ágústsson, a businessman who was essentially unknown to the general public.

Unlike parliamentary elections in Iceland, presidential elections are not fought on the basis of party politics; instead, candidates attempt to use their personalities to attract supporters and appear as a living symbol of national unity.

By tradition, the presidency is an almost entirely powerless office, as the presidents almost never use the powers granted to them by the constitution, instead just exercising &quot;moral authority&quot;. Ólafur Ragnar, however, has expressed a wish to have a public discussion on the role of the head of state. Unprecedentedly in the history of the Icelandic Republic, on 2 June 2004 Ólafur Ragnar vetoed a media ownership law passed by the Althing. Davíð Oddsson, who was Prime Minister at the time, claimed that the veto was tainted because the president&#x27;s daughter worked for Baugur Group, which had recently acquired roughly half of the country&#x27;s media. There was little doubt that Ólafur Ragnar would be re-elected, but the veto controversy had an effect on the voting – the unprecedentedly high number of empty ballots (20.6% of the total) was thought to be largely a protest of the veto.

==Electoral system==
The President of Iceland is elected in one round by first-past-the-post voting.

<text>Victor de Broglie, Prince of Broglie (22 September 1756 – 27 June 1794) was a French Army officer and politician who was executed by guillotine during the French Revolution. 

==Biography==
Victor de Broglie was born in Paris, the eldest son of Victor François de Broglie, 2nd Duke of Broglie, who had attained the rank of &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in the French Royal Army. Victor adopted radical opinions and served with the Marquis de La Fayette and the Comte de Rochambeau in the American War of Independence.

The prince was a member of the Jacobin Club, and sat in the National Constituent Assembly after the French Revolution, constantly voting on the Liberal side. He served as chief of the staff to the First Republic&#x27;s Army on the Rhine, but, during the Reign of Terror, he was denounced, arrested, and guillotined in Paris.

Since the old duc de Broglie survived him, the prince de Broglie&#x27;s eldest son, Victor, eventually became the third duc de Broglie. The prince&#x27;s dying admonition to his little son was to remain faithful to the principles of the Revolution, however unjust and ungrateful it seemed then to be.

==Family==
The prince&#x27;s wife shared her husband&#x27;s imprisonment, but managed to escape to Switzerland, where she remained till the fall of Robespierre. She then returned to Paris with her children and lived there quietly until 1796, when she married Marc-René de Voyer de Paulmy d&#x27;Argenson, grandson of the Comte d&#x27;Argenson (minister of war during the reign of Louis XV). Under the care of his step-father, Victor de Broglie received a careful and liberal education and made his entrée into the aristocratic and literary society of Paris under the First French Empire.

<text>The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage is a 1989 book written by Clifford Stoll. It is his first-person account of the hunt for a computer hacker who broke into a computer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

Stoll&#x27;s use of the term extended the metaphor &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s egg&quot; from brood parasitism in birds to malware.

== Summary ==
Author Clifford Stoll, an astronomer by training, managed computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California. One day in 1986 his supervisor asked him to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an unauthorized user who had apparently used nine seconds of computer time and not paid for it. Stoll eventually realized that the unauthorized user was a hacker who had acquired superuser access to the LBNL system by exploiting a vulnerability in the movemail function of the original GNU Emacs.

Early on, and over the course of a long weekend, Stoll rounded up fifty terminals, as well as teleprinters, mostly by &quot;borrowing&quot; them from the desks of co-workers away for the weekend. He physically attached them to the fifty incoming phone lines at LBNL. When the hacker dialed in that weekend, Stoll located the phone line used, which was coming from the Tymnet routing service. With the help of Tymnet, he eventually tracked the intrusion to a call center at MITRE, a defense contractor in McLean, Virginia. Over the next ten months, Stoll spent enormous amounts of time and effort tracing the hacker&#x27;s origin. He saw that the hacker was using a 1200 baud connection and realized that the intrusion was coming through a telephone modem connection. Stoll&#x27;s colleagues, Paul Murray and Lloyd Bellknap, assisted with the phone lines.

After returning his &quot;borrowed&quot; terminals, Stoll left a teleprinter attached to the intrusion line in order to see and record everything the hacker did. He watched as the hacker sought — and sometimes gained — unauthorized access to military bases around the United States, looking for files that contained words such as &quot;nuclear&quot; or &quot;SDI&quot; (Strategic Defense Initiative). The hacker also copied password files (in order to make dictionary attacks) and set up Trojan horses to find passwords. Stoll was amazed that on many of these high-security sites the hacker could easily guess passwords, since many system administrators had never bothered to change the passwords from their factory defaults. Even on military bases, the hacker was sometimes able to log in as &quot;guest&quot; with no password.

This was one of the first⁠—⁠if not &quot;the&quot; first⁠—documented cases of a computer break-in, and Stoll seems to have been the first to keep a daily logbook of the hacker&#x27;s activities. Over the course of his investigation, Stoll contacted various agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI). At the very beginning there was confusion as to jurisdiction and a general reluctance to share information; the FBI in particular was uninterested as no large sum of money was involved and no classified information host was accessed.

Studying his log book, Stoll saw that the hacker was familiar with VAX/VMS, as well as AT&amp;T Unix. He also noted that the hacker tended to be active around the middle of the day, Pacific time. Eventually Stoll hypothesized that, since modem bills are cheaper at night and most people have school or a day job and would only have a lot of free time for hacking at night, the hacker was in a time zone some distance to the east, likely beyond the US East Coast.

With the help of Tymnet and agents from various agencies, Stoll found that the intrusion was coming from West Germany via satellite. The West German post office, the &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot;, had authority over the phone system there, and traced the calls to a university in Bremen. In order to entice the hacker to reveal himself, Stoll set up an elaborate hoax—known today as a honeypot—by inventing a fictitious department at LBNL that had supposedly been newly formed by an &quot;SDI&quot; contract, also fictitious. When he realized the hacker was particularly interested in the faux SDI entity, he filled the &quot;SDInet&quot; account (operated by an imaginary secretary named &quot;Barbara Sherwin&quot;) with large files full of impressive-sounding bureaucratese. The ploy worked, and the &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot; finally located the hacker at his home in Hanover.

The hacker&#x27;s name was Markus Hess, and he had been engaged for some years in selling the results of his hacking to the Soviet Union&#x27;s civilian intelligence agency, the KGB. There was ancillary proof of this when a Hungarian agent contacted the fictitious SDInet at LBNL by mail, based on information he could only have obtained through Hess. Apparently this was the KGB&#x27;s method of double-checking to see if Hess was just making up the information he was selling. Stoll later flew to West Germany to testify at the trial of Hess.

<doc id="712215" wikidata="Q3110674" url="?curid=712215" title="LGBTQ themes in speculative fiction">
<text>LGBTQ themes in speculative fiction include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) themes in science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres. Such elements may include an LGBTQ character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the heteronormative.

Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBTQ readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.

==History==
Before the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.

From the 1980s onwards, homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the LGBT community. This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction.

There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.

==Critical analysis==

As genres of popular literature, science fiction (SF) and fantasy often seem more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.

In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called &quot;cognitive estrangement&quot;: the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider&#x27;s perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.

In spite of the freedom offered by the genres, gay characters often remain contrived and stereotypical, and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters in such a way as to not contradict mainstream society&#x27;s assumptions about gender roles. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.

Speculative fiction has traditionally been &quot;straight&quot;; Samuel R. Delany has written that the science fiction community is predominantly made up of white male heterosexuals, but that the proportion of minorities, including gay people, is generally higher than found in a &quot;literary&quot; group. The inclusion of homosexuality in SF has been described in &quot;Science Fiction Culture&quot; as &quot;sometimes lagging behind the general population, sometimes surging ahead&quot;. Nicola Griffith has written that LGBT readers tend to identify strongly with the outsider status of mutants, aliens, and characters who lead hidden or double lives in science fiction. In comparison, Geoff Ryman has claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible, with his books being marketed as one or the other, but never both, and David Seed said that SF purists have denied that SF that focuses on soft science fiction themes and marginalised groups (including &quot;gay SF&quot;) is &quot;real&quot; science fiction. Gay and lesbian science fiction have at times been grouped as distinct subgenres of SF, and have some tradition of separate publishers and awards.

==Literature==
===Early speculative fiction===

&quot;A True History&quot; by the Greek writer Lucian (A.D. 120–185) is noted for both its fantastical setting and its depiction of sexuality, being termed by some as the earliest surviving example of science fiction or the first ever &quot;gay science fiction story&quot;. The narrator is suddenly enveloped by a typhoon and swept up to the moon, which is inhabited by a society of men that are at war with the sun. After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son the prince in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the moon&#x27;s soil.

In other fantastical works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or &quot;beastliness&quot;, as in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms. The frank treatment of sexual topics of pre-nineteenth century literature was abandoned in most speculative fiction, although Wendy Pearson has written that issues of gender and sexuality have been central to SF since its inception but were ignored by readers and critics until the late twentieth century. Early works that contained LGBT themes and showed the gay characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; (1890) by Oscar Wilde, which shocked contemporary readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters.

&quot;An Anglo-American Alliance&quot;, a 1906 novel by Gregory Casparian, was the first speculative novel to openly portray a lesbian romantic relationship.

===Pulp era (1920–30s)===
During the pulp era, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines&#x27; contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; this was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time.

As the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a &#x27;decadent slaveholding lordling&#x27; whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.

One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel &quot;Odd John&quot; (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.

===Golden Age (1940–50s)===
In the Golden Age of Science Fiction, the genre &quot;resolutely ignored the whole subject&quot; of homosexuality, according to Joanna Russ. As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like Philip Jose Farmer and Theodore Sturgeon were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions. The majority of LGBT characters were depicted as caricatures, such as &quot;man-hating amazons&quot;, and attempts at portraying homosexuals sympathetically or non-stereotypically were met with hostility.

Sturgeon wrote many stories during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story &quot;The World Well Lost&quot; (1953), first published in &quot;Universe&quot; magazine, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the &quot;Universe&quot; cover was &quot;[His] most daring story&quot;; its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, and it is now regarded as a milestone in science fiction&#x27;s portrayal of homosexuality. According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, the editor (Haywood Braun) not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well. Sturgeon would later write &quot;Affair with a Green Monkey&quot;, which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published &quot;Venus Plus X&quot;, in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist&#x27;s homophobia portrayed unfavourably.

Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in Charles Beaumont&#x27;s short story &quot;The Crooked Man&quot; (1955), first published in &quot;Playboy&quot;, inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress the heterosexual minority. In Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;The Wanting Seed&quot; (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment; Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world.

Although not usually identified as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, the first of many works such as &quot;The Nova Trilogy&quot; and &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.

===New Wave era (1960–70s)===

By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called &quot;the New Wave,&quot; a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in &quot;inner space&quot; instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential &quot;New Worlds&quot;), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch and Samuel R. Delany.

Feminist SF authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm. Joanna Russ&#x27;s &quot;The Female Man&quot; (1975) and the award-winning story &quot;When It Changed&quot;, showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, were enormously influential. Russ is largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction; she has stated that being openly lesbian was bad for her career and sales. Similar themes are explored in James Tiptree Jr.&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot;, which presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically &quot;male&quot; problems such as war, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical. Tiptree was a closeted bisexual woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym, and explored the sexual impulse as her main theme.

Other feminist utopias do not include lesbianism: Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; (1969) depicts trans-species sexuality, in which individuals are neither &quot;male&quot; nor &quot;female&quot; but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities, making them in some senses bisexual. In &quot;The Language of the Night&quot;, a collection of Le Guin&#x27;s criticism, she admits to having &quot;quite unnecessarily locked the Gethenians into heterosexuality ... the omission [of the homosexual option] implies that sexuality is heterosexuality. I regret this very much.&quot; Le Guin often explores alternative sexuality in her works, and has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality, such as the bisexual bonding between clones in &quot;Nine Lives&quot;. Sexual themes and fluid genders also figure in the works of John Varley, who came to prominence in the 1970s. Many of his stories contain mentions of same-sex love and gay and lesbian characters. In his &quot;Eight Worlds&quot; suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex on a whim. Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology, as in his story &quot;Options&quot;, as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality eventually becoming the norm for society. His &quot;Gaea trilogy&quot; features lesbian protagonists, and almost all the characters are to some degree bisexual.

Samuel R. Delany was one of the first openly gay science fiction authors; in his earliest stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a &quot;sensibility&quot;, rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as &quot;Babel-17&quot; (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three-person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In &quot;Dhalgren&quot; (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities. Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.

Delany&#x27;s Nebula-winning short story &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah&quot; posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award-winning stories featuring gay characters, such as &quot;Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones&quot;, were to follow, all collected in Delany&#x27;s short story retrospective &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories&quot;. Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics. In later works, gay themes become increasingly central to Delany&#x27;s works, attracting controversy, and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography.
Delany&#x27;s SF series Return to Neveryon was the first novel from a major US publisher to deal with the impact of AIDS, and he later won the William Whitehead Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in gay and lesbian writing. His most recent gay-themed novel is &quot;Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders&quot;.

Other big name SF authors approached LGBT themes in individual works: In &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex for the purpose of procreation remains held as the ideal. The female bisexuality in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a &quot;wrongness&quot; deserving pity. Heinlein&#x27;s use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled &quot;The Embarrassments of Science Fiction&quot; by SF writer Thomas Disch. Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel &quot;On Wings of Song&quot; (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel &quot;334&quot;, gay people are referred to as &quot;republicans&quot; in contrast to the straight &quot;democrats&quot;. However, he did not try to write to a particular community: &quot;I&#x27;m gay myself, but I don&#x27;t write &#x27;gay&#x27; literature.&quot;

Michael Moorcock was one of the first scifi authors to depict positive portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, &quot;The Final Programme&quot;, most of the leading characters, including the central &#x27;hero&#x27; Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock&#x27;s fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.

Elizabeth Lynn is an openly lesbian science fiction and fantasy writer who has written numerous works featuring positive gay protagonists. Her &quot;Chronicles of Tornor&quot; novels (1979–80), the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first fantasy novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background, and included explicit and sympathetic depictions of same-sex love; the third novel is of particular lesbian interest. Her SF novel &quot;A Different Light&quot; (1978) featured a same-sex relationship between two men, and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore and chain &quot;A Different Light&quot;. The &quot;magical lesbian tale&quot; &quot;The Woman Who Loved the Moon&quot; also won a World Fantasy Award and is the title story in the Lynn&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Who Loved the Moon&quot;, a collection also containing other gay speculative fiction stories.

===Modern science fiction===

After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider tolerance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors, such as David Gerrold, Geoff Ryman, Nicola Griffith and Melissa Scott, and transgender writers such as Jessica Amanda Salmonson, an author who chronicled the progress of her gender change in the pages of &quot;The Literary Magazine of Fantasy and Terror.&quot; In the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers. However, depictions of unrealistic lesbians continue to propagate for the titillation of straight men in genre works. In the 1990s, stories depicting alternative sexualities experienced a resurgence.

&quot;Uranian Worlds&quot;, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.

In Lois McMaster Bujold&#x27;s &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot; (1986), the titular &quot;unlikely hero&quot; is gay obstetrician Dr. Ethan Urquhart of the single-gender world Athos, whose dangerous adventure alongside the first woman he has ever met presents both a future society where homosexuality is the norm and the lingering sexism and homophobia of our own world.

Cyberpunk, a genre arising in the mid-1980s, has been seen as heteronormative and masculine to a large extent, although feminist and &quot;queer&quot; interpretations are mooted by some critics. Melissa Scott, a lesbian writer, has written several cyberpunk works that prominently feature LGBT characters, including Lambda-award-winning &quot;Trouble and Her Friends&quot; (1994) and &quot;Shadow Man&quot; (1995), the latter having also been inducted into the Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame. Scott has reported that reviewers called some of these works &quot;too gay&quot; for mixing cyberpunk clichés with political themes. Many of Scott&#x27;s other SF works also contain LGBT themes; she said that she chooses to write about gay themes using SF because these genres allow her to explore situations in which LGBT people are treated better or worse than in reality, and that it also gives an estranging distance for readers averse to such themes, who might otherwise feel accused of similar discriminatory practices as those in the books.

A number of LGBT-themed anthologies of speculative short fiction have been published since the 1980s, the first being the science fiction-themed &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; (1984), edited by Jeffrey M. Elliot. These anthologies often focus on particular sexual identities, such as the &quot;New Exploits of Lesbians&quot; series with titles in the fantasy (&quot;Magical lesbians&quot;, &quot;Fairy-tale lesbians&quot;) and horror (&quot;Twilight lesbians&quot;) areas. Others are grouped around particular genres, such as the award-winning &quot;Bending the Landscape&quot; series edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel, in which each of the three volumes focus upon science fiction, fantasy or horror; or the horror-oriented &quot;Queer Fear&quot; anthologies, edited by Michael Rowe.

Gay characters became common enough that Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; &quot;The Tough Guide to Fantasyland&quot; contains an entry on &quot;gay mages&quot; as a fantasy cliché. Such characters are found in Mercedes Lackey&#x27;s works, such as the Lambda award-winning &quot;The Last Herald Mage&quot; trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their relationships are an integral part of the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar. Much of the extended series provides non-heterosexual role-models for younger readers.

David Gerrold is an openly gay science fiction writer with a number of LGBT-themed works. &quot;The Man Who Folded Himself&quot; (1973) examines the narcissistic love of a time traveler who has gay orgies with alternate versions of himself, including female and lesbian versions. Gerrold&#x27;s multi-award-winning &quot;Jumping Off the Planet&quot; (2000) is the first book in a young adult series, in which a father kidnaps his three sons and goes to the moon; one son is gay, and rejected from college as he is ineligible for a scholarship available to straight people who agree to have their sexual orientation changed to prevent overpopulation. Gerrold received a Nebula Award for a semi-autobiographical short story &quot;The Martian Child&quot; (1994), in which a gay man adopts a child. The story was later expanded to book length, and a feature film was produced in which the protagonist was straight, causing criticism.

Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning novels and short stories that prominently feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of &quot;The Child Garden&quot; (1989), an outsider because of her resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into a relationship with a similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. &quot;Lust&quot; (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. &quot;Was&quot; (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally challenged abused child, linked by their connection to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; books and film. In a &quot;Locus&quot; magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible:In 1990, if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I&#x27;d have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then &quot;Was&quot; came out... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn&#x27;t say SF — at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay.

===21st century===
The beginning of the 21st century saw a continual growth of speculative LGBT fiction. Some examples are given below:

Larissa Lai&#x27;s novel &quot;Salt Fish Girl&quot; (2002) depicts lesbian relationships in the context of a dystopian corporate future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. &quot;Salt Fish Girl&quot; engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Award in 2002.

Elizabeth Bear&#x27;s &quot;Carnival&quot; (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. Sarah Hall&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;The Carhullan Army&quot; (2007), published in the US under the title &quot;Daughters of the North&quot;, matter-of-factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same-sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.

Rafael Grugman&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nontraditional Love&quot; (2008) describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden and conception occurs in test tubes. In lesbian families, one of the women carries the child while gay male couples turn to surrogate mothers to bring their children to term. The Netherlands is the only country where mixed-sex marriages are permitted. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world. The author paints a grotesque situation, but underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves.

Reviewing the field of lesbian romance speculative fiction in 2012, Liz Bourke concluded that it remained a niche subgenre of uneven quality, but mentioned Jane Fletcher, Chris Anne Wolfe, Barbara Ann Wright, Sandra Barret and Ruth Diaz as contributors of note. More recently in Rick Riordan&#x27;s 2013 teen fantasy novel &quot;The House of Hades&quot;, character Nico di Angelo professes romantic feelings for protagonist Percy Jackson. In terms of gender identity, Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;2312&quot; depicts a world of fluid gender, where &quot;self-images for gender&quot; include feminine, masculine, androgynous, gyandromorphous, hermaphrodite, ambisexual, bisexual, intersex, neuter, eunuch, nonsexual, undifferentiated, gay, lesbian, queer, invert, homosexual, polymorphous, poly, labile, berdache, hijra, and two-spirit. In 2013, Natasja Hellenthal&#x27;s lesbian fantasy debut novel &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Curse&quot; became an Amazon bestseller, and in her The Comyenti Series the main female character is bisexual and falls in love with a lesbian character. The comyentis are a supernatural/paranormal bisexual species.

Ellen Kushner&#x27;s mannerpunk &quot;Swordspoint&quot; series of novels feature homosexual and bisexual protagonists in the 18th century fantasy world of Riverside. It spawned &quot;Swordspoint: Tremontaine&quot;, a thirteen-part &quot;Fantasy of Manners&quot; written by a variety of authors. The audiobooks of &quot;Swordspoint&quot; won the 2013 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, the Earphones Award from AudioFile Magazine, and the 2013 Communicator Award: Gold Award of Excellence (Audio). The &quot;Swordspoint&quot; sequel &quot;The Fall of the Kings&quot;, written with Kushner&#x27;s wife Delia Sherman, won the 2014 Wilbur Award.

Within the realm of tie-in speculative fiction, there was also an increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot; literature. In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch, the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two &#x27;male&#x27; and two &#x27;female&#x27; species. Andrew J. Robinson&#x27;s Garak novel, &quot;A Stitch in Time&quot;, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack&#x27;s 2014 novel, &quot;The Crimson Shadow&quot;. In the original series &quot;Star Trek: Vanguard&quot;, created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.

Sarah Waters is a Welsh author popular for lesbian romances in historical times, most often the Victorian Era. Popular works of hers include &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; (1998) and &quot;Fingersmith&quot; (2002).

==Comics and manga==

For much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed &quot;de facto&quot; censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character&#x27;s orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA&#x27;s seal of approval.

The CCA came into being in response to Fredric Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality, including subliminal homosexuality. Wertham claimed Wonder Woman&#x27;s strength and independence made her a lesbian, and stated that &quot;The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies.&quot;

In recent years the number of LGBT characters has increased greatly in mainstream superhero comics; however, LGBT characters continue to be relegated to supporting roles, and generate criticism for the treatment gay characters receive.

===Marvel===
Alpha Flight&#x27;s Northstar was the first major gay character in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar&#x27;s sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; issue 106 and his outing made national headlines.

In 2002, Marvel Comics revived &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; in their Marvel MAX imprint, introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine. The first edition of the Rawhide Kid&#x27;s gay saga was called &quot;Slap Leather&quot;. According to a CNN.com article, the character&#x27;s sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic&#x27;s style is . Conservative groups quickly protested the gay take on the character and claimed that children would be corrupted by it, and the covers carried an &quot;Adults only&quot; label.

Marvel&#x27;s policy had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an &quot;Adults only&quot; label, in response to conservative protests. But in 2006, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada claimed that this policy was no longer in force, and Marvel received GLAAD&#x27;s 2005 Best Comic Book Award for its superhero comic book &quot;Young Avengers&quot;, which included gay characters but was published as a mainstream book with no warning label. In 2012, despite protests, Marvel published an issue of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; in which Northstar married his partner, Kyle.

===DC===
DC often still draws criticism for its use of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought by some to be an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter – Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise.
In addition to true LGBT characters, there has been controversy over various homosexual interpretations of the most famous superhero comic book characters. Batman&#x27;s relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny, in spite of the majority of creators associated with the creator denying that the character is gay. Psychologist Fredric Wertham, who in &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; asserted that &quot;Batman stories are psychologically homosexual&quot;, claimed to find a &quot;subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature &#x27;Batman&#x27; and his young friend &#x27;Robin&#x27;&quot;. It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because &quot;he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,&quot; and &quot;the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp.&quot; Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a &quot;homophobic nightmare&quot;; he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting.

Some continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from &quot;Batman&quot; #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York&#x27;s paper &quot;All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s&quot;. Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.

Many of DC&#x27;s gay characters, such as Obsidian and Renee Montoya, were changed or essentially erased in The New 52 reboot of 2011. Meanwhile, others, such as Kate Kane, were given far less attention than before the reboot. In 2012 DC announced that an &quot;iconic&quot; character would now be gay in the new DC universe. It was then revealed that Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern, was that character. This led to fan outcry because his status as &quot;iconic&quot; is debatable, and he does not actually exist in the mainstream DC universe. This also effectively meant that the already gay character, Obsidian, could not exist as he was Alan Scott&#x27;s child.

===Manga===
Yaoi and yuri (also known as &quot;Boys&#x27; Love&quot; and &quot;Girls&#x27; Love,&quot; respectively) are Japanese genres which have homosexual romance themes, across a variety of media. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri is now available in many countries and languages. The characters of yaoi and yuri do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. As with much manga and anime, SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common: For example, &quot;Ai no Kusabi&quot;, a 1980s yaoi light novel series described as a &quot;magnum opus&quot; of the Boys Love genre, involves a science fictional caste system. &quot;Simoun&quot; has been described as being &quot;a wonderful sci fi series&quot; which does not have to rely on its yuri content to appeal to the audience.

Yaoi has been criticised for stereotypical and homophobic portrayals of its characters, and failing to address gay issues. Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is used as a plot device to &quot;heighten the drama&quot;, or to show the purity of the leads&#x27; love. Rachel Thorn has suggested that as BL is a romance narrative, having strong political themes may be a &quot;turn off&quot; to the readers. Critics state that the genre challenges heteronormativity via the &quot;queer&quot; &quot;bishōnen&quot;.

There is also a style of manga called Bara, which is typically written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and is more likely to acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres.

==Film and television==
In general, speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.

===Film===
LGBT characters in films began to appear more regularly only in the 1980s. Films in the late 1920s and early 1930s reflected the liberal attitudes of the day and could include sexual innuendos and references to homosexuality, but from the 1930s until 1968 the film industry in the US followed the Production Code. The code spelled out what was morally acceptable for a public audience; references to sexual &quot;perversions&quot; such as homosexuality were forbidden. Virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code, and similar censorship was common in other countries, for example an early version of the first lesbian vampire film &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a film described by Vito Russo in &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot; as presenting &quot;homosexuality as a predatory weakness&quot;, was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1935, who said in part &quot;...&quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.&quot;. Horror author Anne Rice has named &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction, naming a bar in her novel &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in honor of the film.
Films produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, such as in the cult horror film &quot;White Zombie&quot;.

The less stringent rules of the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex as one of their major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story &quot;Carmilla&quot;. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film &quot;Does Dracula Suck?&quot; in 1969.

Gay genre films remain rare, and science fiction films&#x27; inclusion of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, such as the &quot;stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual&quot; minor character played by Harvey Fierstein in the 1996 blockbuster &quot;Independence Day&quot;, a film whose main theme has been described as being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also interesting to note that the film&#x27;s director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like &quot;Cthulhu&quot; (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but his homosexuality is not the main aspect of the character, although it is important in the development of the character&#x27;s psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; there are two secondary characters – one gay, one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters.

===Television===
LGBT characters began appearing on television with increasing frequency only in the 1990s. The 1994 television science fiction show &quot;Babylon 5&quot; introduced a bisexual character, Susan Ivanova, whose relationship with a fellow female telepath was revealed in season 2 (1995). &quot;The Advocate&quot; called this relationship out as the closest that the Star Trek franchise or any &quot;Star Trek clone&quot;, as he called the show, had come to a &quot;gay creature—much less a gay human being.&quot; &quot;Babylon 5&quot; continued to explore the state of same-sex relationships in the future with the introduction of a male-male marriage and subsequent honeymoon as cover for two of the main characters who were on a covert mission to a Mars colony in season 4.

The &quot;&quot; fantasy television series introduced its main characters, Xena and Gabrielle, as close companions; fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons, although the lesbian content remained at the subtext level. The series has been cited as &quot;trail-blazing&quot; and breaking down barriers, allowing the production of subsequent programming such as &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which introduced a number of LGBT characters. The most famous is the major character, Willow and her partners Tara and Kennedy. Although praised for their &quot;healthy relationship&quot; and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime-time television, others criticised the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex. Tara&#x27;s death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry among the LGBT community, who saw it as a &quot;homophobic cliché&quot;. Andrew Wells, a recurring villain and eventual ally, was strongly implied to be gay, although closeted. The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction, including &quot;Torchwood&quot;. The series won a number of LGBT themed awards, and was regarded as groundbreaking in its portrayal of gay youth.

&quot;Torchwood&quot; is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running &quot;Doctor Who&quot; franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBTQ themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, Series creator Russell T Davies said that he hoped to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters: &quot;Without making it political or dull, this is going to be a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can&#x27;t define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, &#x27;This is a gay character and he&#x27;ll only ever go off with men.&#x27;&quot; Davies has also described Jack Harkness as omnisexual: &quot;He&#x27;ll shag anything with a hole. Jack doesn&#x27;t categorise people: if he fancies you, he&#x27;ll do it with you.&quot;

The inclusion of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal. For example, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise&#x27;s lack of same-sex relationships has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but that the franchise&#x27;s coverage has remained meagre.

Within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, there had been little LGBT representation until &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; in 2017. &quot;The International Review of Science Fiction&quot; ran a feature entitled &quot;Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9&quot;. However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an &quot;issue&quot; within the new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Rejoined&quot;, which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil &quot;mirror universe&quot; (&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot;) or body possession (&quot;Warlord&quot; and others). In a 2000 &quot;Fandom &quot;interview, &quot;Star Trek&quot; screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference. In recent years, a few of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay.

In 2005 the television series &quot;Dante&#x27;s Cove&quot; premiered on the here! cable station. The series included both gay and lesbian couples dealing with supernatural situations in the coastal town of the same name. The following year, Syfy premiered the series &quot;Eureka&quot;. The series spotlighted a fictional town in Oregon that consisted almost entirely of geniuses. This included the town&#x27;s café owner Vincent, who also happened to be gay.

HBO brought then new series &quot;True Blood&quot; to the forefront of gay genre television, introducing a variety of omnisexual characters to the small screen in 2008 including: Lafayette Reynolds (played by Nelsan Ellis), Jesus Velasquez (played by Kevin Alejandro), Tara Thornton (played by Rutina Wesley), Pam Swynford De Beaufort (played by Kristin Bauer van Straten), Eddie Gauthier (played by Stephen Root), Russell Edgington (played by Denis O&#x27;Hare), and Rev. Steve Newlin (played by Michael McMillian).

&quot;Stargate Universe&quot; in 2009 became the first space-based science fiction show to feature an openly gay character in its primary cast, which was &quot;Camille Wray&quot; played by Ming-Na. Wray was also the first gay character in the franchise and the first primary lesbian Asian-American character on primetime television. Wray&#x27;s storyline featured a committed long-term relationship with her Earth-bound partner Sharon (played by Reiko Aylesworth), the lifelike portrayal of which was very positively received by the lesbian community and press. &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; was cancelled after a two-season run.

In 2009 the series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; premiered on the Syfy cable network. The series later introduced a character named Steve Jinks, played by actor Aaron Ashmore, a gay government agent assigned to assist in the containment of bizarre artifacts.

In 2010 a cable series prequel to &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; was introduced titled &quot;Caprica&quot;. The series highlighted a world in which same-sex marriage was common. One of the central characters named Sam Adama, played by Sasha Roiz, had a husband named Larry, played by Julius Chapple.

In 2011 the cable station Syfy premiered the series &quot;Being Human&quot;, an Americanized version of the previously released British series of the same name. A lesbian character named Emily Levison, played by actress Alison Louder, was introduced as the sister to one of the main characters. That same year the FX cable series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; highlighted gay ghost couple Chad Warwick and Patrick, played by Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears. The HBO cable station premiered &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, based on the book series of the same name. The series included gay couple Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell, played by actors Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones. MTV also premiered the cable series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; that same year. One of the characters depicted is an out gay high school lacrosse player named Danny Mahealani, played by Keahu Kahuanui.

===Slash fiction===

The platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as slash fiction – Kirk/Spock being the earliest example. Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright, and until the 1990s was either undistributed or published in zines. With the advent of the internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers began to cluster at sites such as FanFiction.Net, and websites and fanzines dedicated to popular speculative fiction franchises such as &quot;X-files&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; have become common. The use of characters from major SF franchises in &quot;gay readings&quot; has caused legal action: LucasFilm has sent cease and desist orders to prevent gay reinterpretations of &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters, and Anne Rice is notorious for attempts to stop production of slash fiction based on her &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; characters, although many of the characters are bisexual in canon. Slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBT community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality, but has also been noted as being unrepresentative of the gay community, being more a medium to express feminist dissatisfactions with SF. According to polls, most of slash fandom is made up of heterosexual women with a college degree. These demographics are older than the yaoi fans and they tend to be more easily disturbed about slash depicting underage sexuality, but this is becoming less true due to the popularity of Harry Potter-inspired slash fiction.

Femslash is a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters, Typically, characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canon universe; however, similar fan fiction about lesbian characters are commonly labeled as femslash for convenience. There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples – it has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash, and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters. Janeway/Seven is the main Star Trek femslash pairing, as only they have &quot;an on-screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict&quot;. There is debate about whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; counts as &quot;slash&quot;, their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline. It is &quot;relatively recently&quot; that male writers have begun writing femslash.

==Reaction of the speculative fiction community==
There has been a long history of tolerance of LGBT people in SF fandom. The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions, but generally not discussed — the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was &quot;unthinkable,&quot; and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine editor that the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was &quot;full of gay members&quot; caused a scandal in fan circles. Prominent SF fan Forrest Ackerman is regarded as one of the first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements. He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of &quot;The Ladder&quot;, the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the Daughters of Bilitis. He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support, and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of &quot;lesbian SF&quot; in 1947 in &quot;Vice Versa&quot;, the lesbian fanzine edited by Lisa Ben.

As the number of works featuring LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least as early as the 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott. However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.

Networking between gay fans continued, finally coalescing at the 1986 Worldcon into a plan of action. This led to the first Gaylaxicon science fiction convention being held in 1988 and subsequently to the creation of the Gaylactic Network and the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards by the science fiction community. Gay-themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as WisCon; for example, WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing &quot;Why Women Write About Gay Men&quot;, and the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston had a discussion panel entitled &quot;The Closed Open Mind – Homophobia in Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories&quot;.

Other SF authors, such as Orson Scott Card, have been criticised by the LGBT community for their works or opinions, which have been described as homophobic.

Some lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience, rather than science fiction fans, and published by small feminist or lesbian fiction presses such as Bella Books, Bold Strokes Books, Ylva Publishing, Regal Crest Enterprises, Bedazzled Ink, Intaglio Publications, and Spinsters Ink. A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is Katherine V. Forrest.

==LGBT speculative fiction awards==
A number of awards exist that recognise works at the intersection of LGBT and speculative fiction:
* The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards honour works in science fiction, fantasy and horror which include positive explorations of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters, themes, or issues. The awards were instituted in 1999 and are given for best novel, short fiction and other works of the previous year. Works produced before the awards&#x27; inception are eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame.
* The Lambda Literary Awards include awards for science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first presented in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians and gay men. In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given based on the quality of the writing and the LGBT themes, the author&#x27;s sexual orientation is also a factor.
* The Otherwise Award (formerly the James Tiptree, Jr. Award) honours works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one&#x27;s understanding of gender. Thus, it often goes to works which deal directly or tangentially with gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues.
* Golden Crown Literary Society Awards (or &quot;Goldies&quot;) are given to works containing lesbian themes or depictions of lesbian characters. Awards are given in numerous categories, including speculative fiction (or &quot;SciFi/Fantasy/Horror&quot;) and paranormal romance.

<text>Genesis&#x27;88 was a party promotion crew who threw some of the first acid house parties also known as raves in the United Kingdom from 1988 to 1992.

It was founded during 1988 during the UK&#x27;s discovery of acid house. They were an organisation that staged acid house parties in empty industrial warehouses in London and within the M25 motorway area. &quot;Over the course of 1989, promoters such as World Dance, Genesis, Helter Skelter and Energy succeeded in setting acid house nights free of the urban core&#x27;s constructions, staging ever more elaborate Orbital parties in borrowed and rented fields, the odd warehouse, or some other similarly vacant structure&quot;. At that point in time acid house parties were deemed illegal by authorities because most promoters of the period gained entrance into buildings by breaking and entering.

==Overview and history==
Fuelled by the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), nightclub goers in London were desperate for events that catered to their needs and went on until the early hours of the morning. Genesis’88 found empty warehouses in London and transformed them into state-of-the-art dance arenas that consisted of professional lighting rigs, sound systems and colourful decorations. Unbeknownst to the buildings&#x27; owners the Genesis promoters would wear their best business suits and convince police riot squads that the warehouses were acquired through legitimate channels.

Matthew Collin writes in &quot;Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House&quot;: &quot;From their first party in October 1988 onwards, Genesis developed a prodigious reputation for cracking open huge warehouses and holding illegal raves, week after week, from Aldgate to Hackney, Tottenham to Walthamstow&quot;. 
To give themselves more credit they would assume official titles such as George Michael’s personal manager or project manager for a major record company. Genesis enjoyed a succession of events that saw attendances rise from 300 to 15,000 people. Victims of their own success, Genesis were targeted by the UK government and the criminal underworld attracted by media articles of huge profits (£500,000) being made by such promoters. The Genesis organisers were kidnapped and threatened with death if they didn’t comply with the gangsters. They demanded 25% of all profits in return for 24-hour protection. This plight was shared by other promoters who had also encountered the same terror tactics.

This, coupled with the government&#x27;s label of &quot;Public Enemy No.1&quot;, brought about the end of illegal acid house parties. Genesis continued arranging parties until 1992 before deciding to quit staging these events. One of the promoters Wayne Anthony, penned a book called &quot;Class of 88 - The True Acid House Experience&quot; ().

<doc id="712222" wikidata="Q1325584" url="?curid=712222" title="Transit of Earth from Mars">
<text>A transit of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars takes place when the planet Earth passes directly between the Sun and Mars, obscuring a small part of the Sun&#x27;s disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every ~1,000 years, there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its ascending node take place in May, those at descending node happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 synodic periods, and is analogous to the cycle of transits of Venus from Earth, which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084. The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.

During the event, the Moon can almost always also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at opposition from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any defect of illumination. During the 1879 event, this permitted Charles Augustus Young to attempt a careful measurement of the oblateness (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars&#x27;s polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using radar from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including &quot;Mariner 9&quot;, &quot;Viking 1&quot;, &quot;Viking 2&quot;, and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A science fiction short story published in 1971 by Arthur C. Clarke, called &quot;Transit of Earth&quot;, depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

==Dates of transits==
==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November 4356. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 5934.

The simultaneous occurrence of a transit of Venus and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year 571,741.

<text>Clifford Paul &quot;Cliff&quot; Stoll (born June 4, 1950) is an American astronomer, author and teacher.

He is best known for his investigation in 1986, while working as a system administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, that led to the capture of hacker Markus Hess, and for Stoll&#x27;s subsequent book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot;, in which he details the investigation.

Stoll has written three books as well as articles in the non-specialist press (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in &quot;Scientific American&quot;) on the Curta mechanical calculator and the slide rule, and is a frequent contributor to the mathematics YouTube channel &quot;Numberphile&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Cliff Stoll attended Hutchinson Central Technical High School in Buffalo, New York. He earned a B.S. in Astronomy in 1973 from the University at Buffalo (SUNY). While studying for his undergraduate degree at SUNY Buffalo, Stoll worked in the university&#x27;s electronic music laboratory and was mentored by Robert Moog.

He received his PhD from the University of Arizona in 1980.

==Career==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Stoll was assistant chief engineer at WBFO, a public radio station in his hometown of Buffalo, New York.

In 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker—later identified as KGB recruit Markus Hess—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. After identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess by using a non-existent department at the National Laboratory, allegedly cooperating with the US Department of Defense, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. Stoll spent 10 months trying to track the hacker&#x27;s whereabouts and eventually managed to do so when a hacker tried to gain access to the computer of a DoD contractor in Virginia. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. At the time, gaining cooperation from law enforcement was a challenge due to the relatively new nature of the crime. He described the events of his investigation in &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage&quot; and the paper &quot;Stalking the Wily Hacker&quot;. Stoll&#x27;s book was later chronicled in an episode of WGBH&#x27;s &quot;NOVA&quot; titled &quot;The KGB, the Computer, and Me&quot;, which aired on PBS stations in 1990.

In his 1995 book &quot;Silicon Snake Oil&quot; and an accompanying article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Stoll raised questions about the influence of the Internet on future society, and whether it would be beneficial. He made various predictions in the article, such as calling e-commerce nonviable (due to a lack of personal contact and secure online funds transfers) and the future of printed news publications (&quot;no online database will replace your daily newspaper&quot;). When the article resurfaced on &quot;Boing Boing&quot; in 2010, Stoll left a self-deprecating comment: &quot;Of my many mistakes, flubs, and howlers, few have been as public as my 1995 howler ... Now, whenever I think I know what&#x27;s happening, I temper my thoughts: Might be wrong, Cliff ...&quot;

Stoll was an eighth-grade physics teacher at Tehiyah Day School, in El Cerrito, California, and later taught physics to home-schooled teenagers. Stoll was a regular contributor to MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;The Site&quot;. Stoll is an FCC licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign K7TA. He appears frequently on Brady Haran&#x27;s YouTube channel &quot;Numberphile&quot;.

Stoll sells blown glass Klein bottles on the internet through his company Acme Klein Bottles. He stores his inventory in the crawlspace underneath his home in Oakland, California, and accesses it when needed with a homemade miniature robotic forklift.

<text>The Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música is the national music conservatory for Argentina and it is located in Buenos Aires.

==History==
Ernesto de la Guardia, a member of the Wagnerian Society of Buenos Aires, first proposed the creation of a national conservatory. He gained support from the president Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear and his wife Regina Pacini a noted soprano, the &quot;Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Declamación&quot; (National Conservatory of Music and Recitation) was founded by Argentine musician Carlos López Buchardo, among others, on July 7, 1924. Based upon the School of Lyric and Scenic Art held at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, the conservatory focused on both lyric and theatrical studies, providing instruction in composition, vocal and instrument music, recitation and speech. Carlos López Buchardo became the first director and the first assistant director was . The conservatory began its operations at the Teatro Colón. Within a few years, in 1930 the Conservatory relocated to the upper floors of the Teatro Nacional Cervantes. In 1928, renowned Russian prima ballerina, Elena Smirnova was hired as the first professor of dance of the Conservatory.

In 1939, the name was changed to the Conservatorio Nacional de Música y Arte Escénico (National Conservatory of Music and Performing Arts) and it was renamed again upon the death of Buchardo at the end of 1948. The conservatory was renamed to honor its first director, and has since been known as the Conservatorio Nacional de &quot;Carlos López Buchardo&quot;. In 1950, the Dance Department was split from the organization with the founding of the National School of Dance () and then between 1957 and 1958, the Theater Arts Department was separated from the Conservatory to create the National School of Theater (). Moving several times in the 1940s, by 1982, the Conservatory established its current location (2017) in the Palacio Rocca Avenida Córdoba 2445.

==Modern organization==
The National Conservatoire was divided in 1989 into the present and independent &quot;Escuela Nacional de Música&quot; (basic and first levels) and the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de Música (middle and high levels).

In 1995, the middle level of the National Conservatorium was assigned to the government of the city of Buenos Aires, which was in 1998 named &quot;Conservatorio de Música de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires&quot;.

<text>Susana Natividad Rinaldi was born on December 25, 1935, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She is an Argentine tango singer better known as &quot;La Tana.&quot; Her recognition is notable in various films, television appearances, theatrical performances, and in the music industry.

==Biography==
Susana Natividad Rinaldi was born to a wealthy father and a poor mother in Buenos Aires in 1935. Dubbed &quot;La Tana&quot; (in reference to her Italian origins), she spent her childhood moving throughout different provinces of Argentina. She began studying chamber singing at the National Conservatory of Music at age 14, and in 1955 she entered the School of Dramatic Art. Two years later, she made her television debut and in 1959 debuted in a major theater production. When she was asked to record a poetry concert in 1966 she offered them a tango album, and by the end of that year her first album, with music arranged by bandoneón virtuoso Roberto Pansera, was released.

As her success as a singer grew, she had to let go of the actress world, although she did appear in a couple films and theatrical performances during her singing career. After touring Argentine tango bars and milongas, Rinaldi gained fame as a singer during the late 1960s. She called the attention of her audience by singing tangos which up to then had only been sung by men, including standards by José María Contursi, Enrique Santos Discépolo, Homero Manzi, and Cátulo Castillo. This gave her a deserved reputation among a new audience made up mostly of young university students. She achieved fame when she incorporated into her repertoire songs by new authors, such as Eladia Blázquez, Osvaldo Avena, Héctor Negro, and Chico Novarro.

She and her husband, bandoneón virtuoso Osvaldo Piro, established Magoya, a café concert in seaside Mar del Plata, in 1971. Following the March 1976 coup, however, Rinaldi was forced to leave the country. After a long stay in Paris, she returned to Argentina in 1989 with an innovative idea of a tango-show. Due to this, she was again rejected by traditional tango listeners, although she did become one of the main figures in the tango renewal movement of the time. Since then, she has lived in Paris to establish her career as a singer, making her an icon of international tango.

An artist with a political conscience, she supported her ideals through music in international concert tours and as UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador since 1992. Her tireless defense of human rights and her passionate promotion of a more just and peaceful world earned her the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires in 1990. Other distinctions earned during her lengthy career include the SADAIC Grand Prize in 1969 and 1999; and the Konex Award in 1985, 2001, and 2005.

<doc id="712233" wikidata="Q4091846" url="?curid=712233" title="Canada 2c Large Queen on laid paper">
<text>The 2¢ Large Queen on laid paper is the rarest postage stamp of Canada. Printed in 1868, it was not discovered until 1925, and so far only three have been found, all used. Many more could exist as at least one sheet must have been printed, and possibly many sheets; however, they may all have been destroyed, or lie unrecognised in stamp collections or on cover.

==Background==
The Large Queens were the first issue by Canada; they are so-called to distinguish them from the 1870 issues (the &quot;Small Queens&quot;) which are similar in appearance but physically smaller. The Large Queens were normally printed on wove paper, but the 1¢, 2¢, and 3¢ values were also printed on the less-desirable laid paper. The 1¢ and 3¢ on laid paper were long-known although uncommon.

The &quot;Unitrade Specialized Catalogue of Canadian Stamps&quot; lists Scott number 32, the 2c Laid Paper Large Queen, at $250,000. The last auction price recorded is $247,500.

==First copy==
The stamp was first reported in 1925, although many authorities were dubious, and the Scott catalog did not list it until the 1930s. According to a 2014 BNA Topics First Quarter article by Glenn Archer, the second known example bears a two-ring 5 numeral cancel and was discovered in 1935 in the estate of English stamp dealer JW Westhorpe. According to an 18 November 1971 Globe and Mail article by Douglas Patrick, this example sold for $25,000 to New York dealer Robert Lyman, in the J.N. Sissons&#x27; Firth collection auction. In 1986, Vancouver stamp dealer Daniel Eaton acquired this 2c Laid Paper from Stanley Gibbons in London and sold it to Los Angeles stamp dealer George Holschauer for $90,000. The 1971 Globe and Mail article says A.L. Michael of Stanley Gibbons was the underbidder in the 1971 auction. According to Eaton, Gibbons sold the stamp in 1986 on behalf of John Dupont, who collected Canadian stamps using the alias John Foxbridge.

==Second copy==

Kasimir Bileski purchased the second copy of the stamp in the Lewis Reford sale of October 1950 for $3,800. This copy had also been in the Ferrary collection. Daniel Eaton acquired the stamp from Kasimir Bileski then sold/traded this example to John Jamieson for $150,000. Jamieson sold it to Robert Darling Jr. In 1998 it eventually wound up in the award-winning Ron Brigham collection.

A certificate from The Royal Philatelic Society, London Expert Committee states the following:

&quot;No. 18,955 12 Dec 1935 
We have examined the enclosed Canada: 1868-72, 2c. pale emerald-green, on laid paper, perf. 12,(SG 57A), used stamp, sent by Dr. Lewis L. Reford. of which a photograph is attached hereto, and are of opinion that it is genuine.&quot;

Image reference: Confederation, The Newsletter of the Large and Small Queens Study Group, Number 7, March 1998, pg.4. (This is a study group of the British North American Philatelic Society and .pdf copies of the news letter are available on their website)

This example was offered at auction by Ron Brigham in February 2014. It was estimated at $900,000. and sold for $475,000.

==Third copy discovered==
It was announced on 16 July 2013 that the Greene Foundation had issued a certificate of genuineness to a Canada Two Cent Large Queen stamp on laid paper, Scott number 32. This is only the third known copy of this stamp and the first copy seen since the two existing copies were expertized in 1935 by the Royal Philatelic Society London. According to a cover story in &quot;Canadian Stamp News&quot;, the third 2c Laid Paper was found in an American Philatelic Society salesbook and purchased for less than $5.

Vincent Graves Greene Philatelic Research Foundation Certificate No. G 20118 states the following:
&quot;Date June 24, 2013
Comments: Canada Scott No. 32, used, on horizontal laid paper, .0036 in.
thick, genuine, two diagonal creases, internal tear on right side, dated
Hamilton MR 16, 1870.&quot;
A 2014 First Quarter &quot;BNA Topics&quot; article, however, states that the price was $60 and the purchaser was American collector Michael D. Smith. The stamp is creased and torn and bears an 1870 &quot;Hamilton C W&quot; (Canada West) cancel. This example realized $215,000. plus 15% buyers premium, ($247,250) in the 18 October 2014 Eastern Auction held by Gary Lyon.

<doc id="712234" wikidata="Q2113023" url="?curid=712234" title="Wales, South Yorkshire">
<text>Wales is a village and a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it borders to the south Derbyshire and is astride the M1 motorway. The civil parish of Wales, which has a population of 6,455, increasing to 7,069 at the 2011 Census, encompasses the village and neighbouring settlement Kiveton Park.

==Etymology==

The village shares its name with the country of Wales, and it is likely that the two placenames share a derivation (see: Etymology of Wales). As such, the village name derives from the Germanic word *Walhaz, a term used by Germanic people across Europe to refer to the Romanised inhabitants of the former Empire. It is suggested therefore, that the name records the continuation of a &quot;British&quot; population in this area, which survived the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, and remained distinctively Romano-British in language and culture. An alternative explanation suggests that the settlement&#x27;s name may be derived from the word &quot;Waelas&quot;, meaning &quot;field of battle&quot;.

==History==
The first written reference to the village is as &quot;Walesho&quot; when the Saxon thegn, Wulfric Spot is recorded as possessing it in 1002, by the time of the Doomsday Book, the village is recorded as &quot;Walise&quot;. Sir William Hewet, Lord Mayor of London in 1559, was born in Wales, and his descendants, the Dukes of Leeds, would come to dominate the area. The collieries at Waleswood and Kiveton Park historically provided employment in the area, including to migrants from Wales&#x27; namesake country, until Kiveton Park Colliery was closed in September 1994.

=== Waleswood ===
Waleswood is a small hamlet located to the north-west of Wales. Historically the hamlet was known for Waleswood Hall, and later Waleswood Colliery, which also featured a railway station. Much of the former colliery site is now occupied by the Gulliver&#x27;s Valley theme park.

=== Wales Bar ===
Wales Bar is another hamlet, located to the west of Wales. The village contains typical 20th Century miners housing, with many of the former occupants working in the surrounding collieries at Waleswood and Brookhouse.

==Geography==
The village of Wales itself is located at approximately , at an elevation of around 300 feet (100 m) above sea level. It lies on the A618 and B6059 roads. The M1 motorway bisects the parish, while the southern boundary is partly marked by the Chesterfield Canal whose Norwood Tunnel runs under meadowland to the south. To the west of the village is Rother Valley Country Park.

==Education and employment==
Education in Wales is provided by Wales Primary School and Wales High School.
The industrial estate at &quot;Wales Common&quot; continues to be a large source of employment (not least the food manufacturer Greencore Prepared Foods) &amp; LuK, part of the multi-national manufacturing group producing clutch &amp; automotive parts.

<text>Cheadle Hulme () is a large village in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. It lies in the historic county of Cheshire, south-west of Stockport and south-east of Manchester. In 2011, it had a population of 26,479.

Evidence of Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity, including coins, jewellery and axes, have been discovered locally. The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was a large estate which included neighbouring Cheadle. In the early 14th century, it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle respectively. The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Unlike many English villages, it did not grow around a church; instead it formed from several hamlets, many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme. In the late 19th century, Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle, Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.

Cheadle Hulme has good transport links, with its own railway station and is in close proximity to Manchester Airport, the M60 motorway and the A34 road.

==History==
===Early history===
The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; provides the earliest mention of the area, where it is recorded as &quot;Cedde&quot;, Celtic for &quot;wood&quot;. Local archaeological finds include Bronze Age axes discovered in Cheadle. Evidence of Roman occupation includes coins and jewellery, which were found in 1972, and the modern-day Cheadle Road, originally known as Street Lane, may be of Roman origin. A stone cross dedicated to the Anglo-Saxon St Chad, uncovered in 1873, indicates Anglo-Saxon activity. The cross was found in an area called &quot;Chad Hill&quot;, on the banks of Micker Brook near its confluence with the River Mersey; this area became &quot;Chedle&quot;. Suggestions for the origin of the name include the words , and &quot;leigh&quot; or &quot;leah&quot;, in Old English meaning &quot;clearing&quot;, forming the modern day &quot;Cheadle&quot;. &quot;Hulme&quot; may have been derived from the Old Norse word for &quot;water meadow&quot; or &quot;island in the fen&quot;.

According to the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in 1086, the modern-day Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme were a single large estate. Valued at £20, it was described as &quot;large and important&quot; and &quot;a wood three leagues (about ) long and half as broad&quot;. One of the earliest owners of the property was the Earl of Chester. It was held by a Gamel, a free Saxon, under Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, and later became the property of the de Chedle family, who took their name from the land they owned. By June 1294 Geoffrey de Chedle was Lord of the Manor. Geoffrey&#x27;s descendant Robert (or Roger) died in the early 1320s, leaving the estate to his wife Matilda who held it until her death in 1326. As there were no male heirs the manor, which was now worth £30 per annum, was divided between her daughters, Clemence and Agnes. Clemence inherited the southern half (which would later become the modern-day Cheadle Hulme), and Agnes inherited the northern half (latterly Cheadle). The two areas became known as &quot;Chedle Holme&quot; and &quot;Chedle Bulkeley&quot; respectively. Shortly afterwards the Chedle Holme estate was divided and the part where Hulme Hall is now situated became known as &quot;Holme&quot;, and held by the Vernons. The estates were reunified on the death of the last of the Vernons in 1476.
The only daughter of Clemence and William de Bagulegh, Isabel de Bagulegh, succeeded her parents as owner of the manor, and married Sir Thomas Danyers. Danyers was rewarded for his efforts in the crusades through an annual payment from the King of 40 marks, as well as the gift of Lyme Hall. His daughter Margaret continued to receive payments after his death.

The first John Savage succeeded Margaret, and nine more followed him. The tenth died young, so the estate passed to his brother, Thomas Savage. In 1626 Charles I created the title of Viscount Savage for him. On his death the estate passed to his daughter Joan, who later married John Paulet, 5th Marquess of Winchester. Joan died during childbirth at the age of 23, and the estate passed to the Marquess. The Marquess practised Catholicism, and in 1643 the estate was confiscated due to persecution of Catholics in the English Civil War.

Following this, the estate was acquired by the Moseley family of Manchester and became known as Cheadle Moseley. Anne Moseley was the last of this family to hold the manor, as her husband could not afford to keep it following her death. It was purchased by John Davenport, who bequeathed it to the Bamford family when he died childless in 1760. After the last Bamford died without male issue in 1806, the estate passed to Robert Hesketh who took the name Bamford-Hesketh; it is from this family that the Hesketh Tavern public house in Cheadle Hulme got its name. The last person to hold the manor was Winifred, Countess of Dundonald, one of Bamford-Hesketh&#x27;s descendants.

===Modern history===
Prior to 1868, Cheadle Moseley was a township within the ancient parish of Cheadle. Its population more than doubled during the first half of the 19th century, rising from 971 in 1801 to 2,319 in 1851. Cheadle Moseley became a civil parish in 1868. In 1879, it was merged with neighbouring Cheadle Bulkeley to form the civil parish of Cheadle. Cheadle parish went on to become part of the newly formed Cheadle and Gatley district in 1894. The name &quot;Cheadle Moseley&quot; continued to be used for the area, and appeared on tithes and deeds until the 20th century. In 1974, the Cheadle and Gatley district was abolished and Cheadle Hulme became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.

RAF Handforth was a large and important storage facility that contributed directly to the war effort. The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew the extent of the war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.

Cheadle Hulme did not grow around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets that existed in the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, including Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill Bent, and Grove Lane. Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.

The area was struck by an F1/T2 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.

==Governance==
Cheadle Hulme was historically part of the ancient parish of Cheadle within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire. It formed the township of Cheadle Moseley. Following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, part of Cheadle Moseley was amalgamated into the Municipal Borough of Stockport. Cheadle Moseley became a separate civil parish in 1866, but in 1879 it was united with the neighbouring civil parish of Cheadle Bulkeley to form the civil parish of Cheadle.

Established in 1886, Cheadle Hulme&#x27;s first local authority was the Cheadle and Gatley local board of health, a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of Stockport Etchells township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The board of health was also part of Stockport poor law union. In 1888 the board was divided into four wards: Adswood, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme and Gatley. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area of the local board became Cheadle and Gatley Urban District. There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring urban districts of Wilmslow and Handforth in 1901, and the wards were restructured again, splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south, and merging in Adswood. Due to the fast-paced growth of the district, the wards were again restructured in 1930, with the addition of Heald Green. In 1940 the current wards of Adswood, Cheadle East, Cheadle West, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, Gatley and Heald Green were established. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the Cheadle and Gatley Urban District was abolished, and Cheadle Hulme has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

Since 1950 Cheadle Hulme has been part of the Cheadle parliamentary constituency. It has been represented by Liberal Democrat Tom Morrison since 2024.

==Geography==

At , Cheadle Hulme is in the south of Greater Manchester. Stockport Metropolitan Borough straddles the Cheshire Plain and the Pennines, and Cheadle Hulme is in the west of the borough on the Cheshire Plain. The area lies in the Ladybrook Valley next to the Micker Brook, a tributary of the River Mersey which flows north–west from Poynton through Bramhall and Cheadle Hulme, joining the Mersey in Stockport.

The majority of buildings in the area are houses from the 20th century, but there are a few buildings, landmarks, and objects that date from the 16th century, in addition to Bramall Hall which dates from the 14th century. In particular, there are many Victorian buildings in several places across the area. The local drift geology is mostly glacial boulder clay, as well as glacial sands and gravel. For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles.

Cheadle Hulme&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures of and are slightly above the average for England, while the annual rainfall of and average hours (1,394.5 hours) of sunshine are respectively above and below the national averages.

==Demography==
:&quot;Note: Cheadle Hulme is split into two areas for censuses, Cheadle Hulme North and Cheadle Hulme South. The figures below before 2011 account for both areas. From 2011 the numbers are based on the data for the Cheadle Hulme Built-up area sub division as published by the Office for National Statistics. The data for this area do not match the combined total for the Cheadle North and South wards as the boundaries for this sub-division are slightly different.&quot;
According to the Office for National Statistics, Cheadle Hulme had a population of 24,362 at the 2011 census. The population density was , with a 100–95.3 female-to-male ratio. Of those aged over 16, 25.0% were single (never married or registered a same-sex civil partnership), 58.1% married and 0.1% in a registered same-sex civil partnership Cheadle Hulme&#x27;s 9,962 households included 26.1% one-person, 42.9% Married or same-sex civil partnership couples living together, 6.2% were co-habiting couples, and 8.3% single parents with children. Of those aged 16–74, 13.1% had no academic qualifications.

About 66.6% of Cheadle Hulme&#x27;s residents reported themselves as being Christian, 3.4% Muslim, 1.2% Hindu, 0.6% Jewish, 0.3% Buddhist and 0.1% Sikh. The census recorded 21.1% as having no religion, 0.4% had an alternative religion and 6.3% did not state their religion.



==Economy==

For many years Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, made up of woods, open land, and farms. The local population was made up of farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor. Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.

Local silk weaving became a large part of everyday life. The work took place in domestic cottages in a room known as a &quot;loomshop&quot;, and the woven silk was transported to firms in Macclesfield away. Silk-weaving remained commonplace in the area until the early 20th century, when the process became industrialised. Other industries in the area included a corn mill, which collapsed some time during the First World War, located next to the Micker Brook; cotton weaving; and brickworks, one located where the fire station is and one near the railway station. A coal wharf was situated opposite the railway station and supplied the area with coal.
The building of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people in places such as Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area. In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather&#x27;s Farm on Ladybridge Road.

Cheadle Hulme is served by a fire station on Turves Road which opened in October 1960. Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle. An ambulance station is near the fire station, and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove. Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area. The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.
Cheadle Hulme has a large variety of businesses serving the area. Station Road is home to the shopping precinct (built in 1962) and contains among other businesses an Oxfam shop, an Asda supermarket, a hairdressing salon, an optician, a pharmacy, some clothing retailers and several restaurants. There are more restaurants and cafés along Station Road as well as solicitors and building societies, and long-running family businesses such as Pimlott&#x27;s butchers are also prominent. In 2002, a Tesco Express opened on the site of an old petrol station, and in July 2007 Cheadle Hulme became the home of Waitrose&#x27;s first purpose-built retail outlet in northern England.

According to the 2001 census, the biggest industry of employment for Cheadle Hulme residents is that of wholesale and retail trade and repairs with approximately 16% of people employed in that industry. This is followed closely by real estate, renting and business activities with 15% of people employed in this area. Other big areas of employment include manufacturing (13%), health and social work (11%), and education (10%). Approximately 30% of people were classed as &quot;economically inactive&quot; in the 2001 census. This included retired people, people who had to look after their family, and disabled or sick people.

==Landmarks==
The Swann Lane, Hulme Hall Road, and Hill Top Avenue conservation area contains 16th and 17th century timber-framed buildings, Victorian villas, churches, and some former farmsteads. There are two Grade II listed buildings in this area: Hulme Hall, a timber-framed manor house which dates from either the 16th or 17th century, and 1 Higham Street, formerly Hill Cottage, which is of a similar period and style to Hulme Hall. The Church Inn public house, which dates from either the late 18th or early 19th century, is situated on the edge of this area.
Oak Meadow Park is a small park on Station Road, with a large grass area and woodland. In the early 2000s it was renovated and refurbished, with new fences, benches and footpaths. The project to maintain and improve the park is a continuous process overseen by a local volunteer group. The park is used for special community events throughout the year.

Bruntwood Park has a variety of facilities, including orienteering, an 18-hole, par 3 pitch and putt golf course, children&#x27;s play areas, football pitches, and a BMX track. Bruntwood Park is also home to The Bowmen of Bruntwood, an archery club. Bruntwood Park is a Grade B Site of Biological Interest, and in 1999 was given a Green Flag Award for its high standards. The land it occupies was once a large estate, which at one time included a stud farm. Bruntwood Hall, a Victorian Gothic building constructed in 1861, has been used for various purposes, including serving as Cheadle and Gatley Town Hall from 1944 until 1959. It is now a hotel and since the 1940s the park has been open to the public.

Around 300 men from Cheadle Hulme served in the First World War, and it was decided that those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, including a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. It was designed by British architect Arthur Beresford Pite and created by sculptor Benjamin Clemens. Additions for later wars have been made.

==Transport==
===Road===
Although most of the roads in the area date from the 20th century, there are many older roads formed from ancient routes. Cheadle Road possibly originated in Roman times and Ack Lane (formerly Hack Lane) is named after Hacon, a local Saxon landowner. Hulme Hall Road is named for the landmark it runs through and has existed since at least the 18th century. Until the 20th century, the roads were little more than country lanes and most traffic consisted of horsedrawn carriages, carts and milk floats. The roads were about half as wide as they are currently and have all since been widened to accommodate the increasing amount of traffic. The first cars appeared in Cheadle Hulme in the early 1900s, but horse-drawn vehicles were the main form of transport until the 1920s. A bus, known as the &quot;Rattler&quot;, was introduced around this time and ran a service through the area. It was, however, very slow and noisy, as its name suggests.

The A34 Cheadle by-pass passes nearby; the A5419 and B5095 roads traverse Cheadle Hulme.

===Railway===

The Crewe to Manchester railway was completed in May 1842 and a railway station known as &quot;Cheadle&quot; was built opposite the modern-day Hesketh Tavern. When the Stafford to Manchester railway opened in 1845, the original station closed and the present Cheadle Hulme railway station was built to accommodate the junction between the two railways. The road was renamed to Station Road in the same year and the station was renamed &quot;Cheadle Hulme&quot; in 1866. 

The station has four platforms: two that serve the Crewe to Manchester line and the other two for the Stafford to Manchester line; there are three trains per hour northbound to Manchester Piccadilly, with one train per hour southbound to each of Stoke-on-Trent, Alderley Edge and Crewe.

===Buses===

Cheadle Hulme is well served by bus routes, which are operated predominantly by Stagecoach Manchester. There are frequent services to and from Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly Gardens, as well as to places such as Bramhall, Cheadle, Grove Lane, Wythenshawe Hospital and Manchester Airport.

===Air===

Cheadle Hulme is situated near to Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the United Kingdom outside the London area.

==Education==
Cheadle Hulme&#x27;s first school, established in 1785, was named after local grocer Jonathan Robinson, who donated of land on what is now Woods Lane. The school was built on what is now the corner of Woods Lane and Church Road, and was originally for the teaching of four boys and four girls. With the increasing population and the Education Act 1870 All Saints&#x27; National School was built across the road in 1873, next to All Saints&#x27; Church from which it took its name. Other schools established in the 19th century include the Grove Lane Baptist Day School, built in 1846; Cheadle Hulme School in 1855; the Congregational Church School in the same year; and Ramillies Hall School in 1884. Hulme Hall Grammar School was established in 1928 (has since relocated), Queens Road Primary School opened in 1932, and the school that became Cheadle Hulme High School was built near to the site of the Jonathan Robinson School in the 1930s. 

Most of the other schools in the area were established in the 1950s and 1960s, including Cheadle County Grammar School for Girls (built in 1956) which later became Margaret Danyers Sixth Form College, named after the same Danyers who was lady of the manor in the 14th century. The site is now the Cheadle campus of Cheadle and Marple Sixth Form College. In addition to the college, there are nine primary schools, two secondary schools, Cheadle Hulme High School and St. James&#x27; Catholic High School, which opened in 1980, three private schools and one special school, Seashell Trust.

The East Cheshire Chess Club is located on Church Road and there are two amateur theatre societies: Players&#x27; Dramatic Society on Anfield Road, and Chads Theatre on Mellor Road. Cheadle Hulme Library, which opened on 28 March 1936, is also located on Mellor Road. Cheadle Hulme once had its own cinema named the &quot;Elysian Cinema&quot;, which was located on Station Road, but this closed in March 1974. As of 2009, the closest cinemas to Cheadle Hulme are approximately away in Stockport (Red Rock) and the Parrs Wood entertainment centre, both leisure complexes which include restaurants, bars, bowling and fitness facilities.

Cheadle Hulme is also home to many public houses and restaurants that serve a variety of cuisine, including Indian, Chinese and Italian. The John Millington, a Grade II listed building, was formerly Millington Hall, built for Stockport alderman John Millington. A row of cottages near to the hall served as a meeting place for local Methodists from 1814, before a purpose-built chapel was established. A Sunday school was also established in the same place. The King&#x27;s Hall was built in 1937 and was originally a dance hall before its conversion into a restaurant and public house.

===Fitness and leisure facilities===
Club Cheadle Hulme, which is attached to Cheadle Hulme High School, contains a large sports hall, a dance studio, an astro-turf pitch and gym equipment. Manchester Rugby Club is located on Grove Lane in Cheadle Hulme, as is Cheadle Hulme Cricket Club, which was established in 1881, and a squash club. There is also a lacrosse club &quot;Cheadle Hulme Lacrosse Club&quot; which was established in 1893, a badminton club, and a sports club off Turves Road called the Ryecroft Sports Club, which has tennis courts and a bowling green. The Bowmen of Bruntwood (Stockport&#x27;s only archery club) is situated in Bruntwood Park. The local 11-a-side football team &#x27;Cheadle Hulme Athletic&#x27; was established in 2009 and is currently playing in Division 2 of the Stockport District Sunday Football League. &#x27;Cheadle Hulme Galaxy FC&#x27; was established in 2013 and are currently playing in Division 2 of the Stockport District Sunday Football League.

===Religion===

The oldest reference to Methodist meetings in the area dates to 1786 and regular services took place from the early 19th century when they established their own meeting places with a Methodist church and Sunday school built in 1824. Grove Lane Baptist Church was built in 1840. Anglican worshippers used the Jonathan Robinson School from 1861 for services and in 1863 All Saints Church was built on Church Road. Seven years later the Congregational Church opened on Swann Lane, after services were held in the school room which was built a year earlier. In 1932 a second Anglican church was built: St Andrew&#x27;s Church was founded as a daughter church of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Cheadle. During the Second World War, Roman Catholic services were held in the King&#x27;s Hall on Station Road, and in 1952 St Ann&#x27;s Church was opened on Vicarage Avenue. Grove Lane Baptist Church was rebuilt in the late 1990s and Emmanuel Church, opened in 1966 near Bruntwood Park, moved to a new building in 2001.

<doc id="712245" wikidata="Q3375211" url="?curid=712245" title="Orchestrated objective reduction">
<text>Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR) is a theory postulating that consciousness originates at the quantum level inside neurons (rather than being a product of neural connections). The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. It is proposed that the theory may answer the hard problem of consciousness and provide a mechanism for free will. The hypothesis was first put forward in the early 1990s by Nobel laureate for physics Roger Penrose, and anaesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff. The hypothesis combines approaches from molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, philosophy, quantum information theory, and quantum gravity.

While some other theories assert that consciousness emerges as the complexity of the computations performed by cerebral neurons increases, Orch OR posits that consciousness is based on non-computable quantum processing performed by qubits formed collectively on cellular microtubules, a process significantly amplified in the neurons. The qubits are based on oscillating dipoles forming superposed resonance rings in helical pathways throughout lattices of microtubules. The oscillations are either electric, due to charge separation from London forces, or magnetic, due to electron spin—and possibly also due to nuclear spins (that can remain isolated for longer periods) that occur in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz frequency ranges. Orchestration refers to the hypothetical process by which connective proteins, such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), influence or orchestrate qubit state reduction by modifying the spacetime-separation of their superimposed states. The latter is based on Penrose&#x27;s objective-collapse theory for interpreting quantum mechanics, which postulates the existence of an objective threshold governing the collapse of quantum states, related to the difference of the spacetime curvature of these states in the universe&#x27;s fine-scale structure.

Orchestrated objective reduction has been criticized from its inception by mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists. The criticism concentrated on three issues: Penrose&#x27;s interpretation of Gödel&#x27;s theorem; Penrose&#x27;s abductive reasoning linking non-computability to quantum events; and the brain&#x27;s unsuitability to host the quantum phenomena required by the theory, since it is considered too &quot;warm, wet and noisy&quot; to avoid decoherence.

==Background==

In 1931, mathematician and logician Kurt Gödel proved that any effectively generated theory capable of proving basic arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In other words, a mathematically sound theory lacks the means to prove itself. In his first book concerning consciousness, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot; (1989), Roger Penrose argued that equivalent statements to &quot;Gödel-type propositions&quot; had recently been put forward.

Partially in response to Gödel&#x27;s argument, the Penrose–Lucas argument leaves the question of the physical basis of non-computable behaviour open. Most physical laws are computable, and thus algorithmic. However, Penrose determined that wave function collapse was a prime candidate for a non-computable process. In quantum mechanics, particles are treated differently from the objects of classical mechanics. Particles are described by wave functions that evolve according to the Schrödinger equation. Non-stationary wave functions are linear combinations of the eigenstates of the system, a phenomenon described by the superposition principle. When a quantum system interacts with a classical system—i.e. when an observable is measured—the system appears to collapse to a random eigenstate of that observable from a classical vantage point.

If collapse is truly random, then no process or algorithm can deterministically predict its outcome. This provided Penrose with a candidate for the physical basis of the non-computable process that he hypothesized to exist in the brain. However, he disliked the random nature of environmentally induced collapse, as randomness was not a promising basis for mathematical understanding. Penrose proposed that isolated systems may still undergo a new form of wave function collapse, which he called objective reduction (OR).

Penrose sought to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory using his own ideas about the possible structure of spacetime. He suggested that at the Planck scale curved spacetime is not continuous, but discrete. He further postulated that each separated quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature, a blister in spacetime. Penrose suggests that gravity exerts a force on these spacetime blisters, which become unstable above the Planck scale of formula_1 and collapse to just one of the possible states. The rough threshold for OR is given by Penrose&#x27;s indeterminacy principle:
::formula_2
:where:
::* formula_3 is the time until OR occurs, 
::* formula_4 is the gravitational self-energy or the degree of spacetime separation given by the superpositioned mass, and
::* formula_5 is the reduced Planck constant. 
Thus, the greater the mass–energy of the object, the faster it will undergo OR and vice versa. Mesoscopic objects could collapse on a timescale relevant to neural processing.

An essential feature of Penrose&#x27;s theory is that the choice of states when objective reduction occurs is selected neither randomly (as are choices following wave function collapse) nor algorithmically. Rather, states are selected by a &quot;non-computable&quot; influence embedded in the Planck scale of spacetime geometry. Penrose claimed that such information is Platonic, representing pure mathematical truths, which relates to Penrose&#x27;s ideas concerning the three worlds: the physical, the mental, and the Platonic mathematical world. In &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot; (1994), Penrose briefly indicates that this Platonic world could also include aesthetic and ethical values, but he does not commit to this further hypothesis.

The Penrose–Lucas argument was criticized by mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields is that the argument fails, with different authors attacking different aspects of the argument. Minsky argued that because humans can believe false ideas to be true, human mathematical understanding need not be consistent and consciousness may easily have a deterministic basis. Feferman argued that mathematicians do not progress by mechanistic search through proofs, but by trial-and-error reasoning, insight and inspiration, and that machines do not share this approach with humans.

==Orch OR==
Penrose outlined a predecessor to Orch OR in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot;, coming to the problem from a mathematical viewpoint and in particular Gödel&#x27;s theorem, but lacked a detailed proposal for how quantum processes could be implemented in the brain. Stuart Hameroff separately worked in cancer research and anesthesia, which gave him an interest in brain processes. Hameroff read Penrose&#x27;s book and suggested to him that microtubules within neurons were suitable candidate sites for quantum processing, and ultimately for consciousness. Throughout the 1990s, the two collaborated on the Orch OR theory, which Penrose published in &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot; (1994).

Hameroff&#x27;s contribution to the theory derived from his study of the neural cytoskeleton, and particularly on microtubules. As neuroscience has progressed, the role of the cytoskeleton and microtubules has assumed greater importance. In addition to providing structural support, microtubule functions include axoplasmic transport and control of the cell&#x27;s movement, growth and shape.

Orch OR combines the Penrose–Lucas argument with Hameroff&#x27;s hypothesis on quantum processing in microtubules. It proposes that when condensates in the brain undergo an objective wave function reduction, their collapse connects noncomputational decision-making to experiences embedded in spacetime&#x27;s fundamental geometry. The theory further proposes that the microtubules both influence and are influenced by the conventional activity at the synapses between neurons.

===Microtubule computation===

Hameroff proposed that microtubules were suitable candidates for quantum processing. Microtubules are made up of tubulin protein subunits. The tubulin protein dimers of the microtubules have hydrophobic pockets that may contain delocalized π electrons. Tubulin has other, smaller non-polar regions, for example 8 tryptophans per tubulin, which contain π electron-rich indole rings distributed throughout tubulin with separations of roughly 2 nm. Hameroff claims that this is close enough for the tubulin π electrons to become quantum entangled. During entanglement, particle states become inseparably correlated.

Hameroff originally suggested in the fringe &quot;Journal of Cosmology&quot; that the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a Bose–Einstein condensate. He then proposed a Frohlich condensate, a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was rejected by Reimers&#x27;s group. Hameroff and Penrose contested the conclusion, considering that Reimers&#x27;s microtubule model was oversimplified.

Hameroff then proposed that condensates in microtubules in one neuron can link with microtubule condensates in other neurons and glial cells via the gap junctions of electrical synapses. Hameroff proposed that the gap between the cells is sufficiently small that quantum objects can tunnel across it, allowing them to extend across a large area of the brain. He further postulated that the action of this large-scale quantum activity is the source of 40 Hz gamma waves, building upon the much less controversial theory that gap junctions are related to the gamma oscillation.

In a study Hameroff was part of, Jack Tuszyński of the University of Alberta demonstrated that anesthetics hasten the duration of a process called delayed luminescence, in which microtubules and tubulins trapped light. Tuszyński suspects that the phenomenon has a quantum origin, with superradiance being investigated as one possibility (in a 2024 study, superradiance was confirmed to occur in networks of tryptophans, which are found in microtubules). Tuszyński told &quot;New Scientist&quot; that &quot;We&#x27;re not at the level of interpreting this physiologically, saying &#x27;Yeah, this is where consciousness begins,&#x27; but it may.&quot;

The 2024 study, called Ultraviolet Superradiance from Mega-Networks of Tryptophan in Biological Architectures and published in &quot;The Journal of Physical Chemistry&quot;, confirmed superradiance in networks of tryptophans. Large networks of tryptophans are a warm and noisy environment, in which quantum effects typically are not expected to take place. The results of the study were theoretically predicted and then experimentally confirmed by the researchers. Majed Chergui, who led the experimental team, stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful result. It took very precise and careful application of standard protein spectroscopy methods, but guided by the theoretical predictions of our collaborators, we were able to confirm a stunning signature of superradiance in a micron-scale biological system.&quot; Marlan Scully, a physicist well-known for his work in the field of theoretical quantum optics, said &quot;We will certainly be examining closely the implications for quantum effects in living systems for years to come.&quot; The study states that &quot;by analyzing the coupling with the electromagnetic field of mega-networks of tryptophans present in these biologically relevant architectures, we find the emergence of collective quantum optical effects, namely, superradiant and subradiant eigenmodes. ... our work demonstrates that collective and cooperative UV excitations in mega-networks of tryptophans support robust quantum states in protein aggregates, with observed consequences even under thermal equilibrium conditions.&quot;

==== Microtubule quantum vibration theory of anesthetic action ====
In an experiment, Gregory D. Scholes and Aarat Kalra of Princeton University used lasers to excite molecules within tubulins, causing a prolonged excitation to diffuse through microtubules farther than expected, which did not occur when repeated under anesthesia. However, diffusion results have to be interpreted carefully, since even classical diffusion can be very complex due to the wide range of length scales in the fluid filled extracellular space.

At high concentrations (~5 MAC) the anesthetic gas halothane causes reversible depolymerization of microtubules. This cannot be the mechanism of anesthetic action, however, because human anesthesia is performed at 1 MAC. (Neither Penrose or Hameroff claim that depolymerization is the mechanism of action for Orch OR.) At ~1 MAC halothane, reported minor changes in tubulin protein expression (~1.3-fold) in primary cortical neurons after exposure to halothane and isoflurane are not evidence that tubulin directly interacts with general anesthetics, but rather shows that the proteins controlling tubulin production are possible anesthetic targets. Further proteomic study reports 0.5 mM [14C]halothane binding to tubulin monomers alongside three dozens of other proteins. In addition, modulation of microtubule stability has been reported during anthracene general anesthesia of tadpoles. The study called Direct Modulation of Microtubule Stability Contributes to Anthracene General Anesthesia claims to provide &quot;strong evidence that destabilization of neuronal microtubules provides a path to achieving general anesthesia&quot;.

A highly disputed theory put forth in the mid-1990s by Hameroff and Penrose posits that consciousness is based on quantum vibrations in tubulin/microtubules inside brain neurons. Computer modeling of tubulin&#x27;s atomic structure found that anesthetic gas molecules bind adjacent to amino acid aromatic rings of non-polar π-electrons and that collective quantum dipole oscillations among all π-electron resonance rings in each tubulin showed a spectrum with a common mode peak at 613 THz. Simulated presence of 8 different anesthetic gases abolished the 613 THz peak, whereas the presence of 2 different nonanesthetic gases did not affect the 613 THz peak, from which it was speculated that this 613 THz peak in microtubules could be related to consciousness and anesthetic action.

Another study that Hameroff was a part of claims to show &quot;anesthetic molecules can impair π-resonance energy transfer and exciton hopping in &#x27;quantum channels&#x27; of tryptophan rings in tubulin, and thus account for selective action of anesthetics on consciousness and memory&quot;.

In a study published in August 2024, an undergraduate group led by a Wellesley College professor found that rats given epothilone B, a drug that binds to microtubules, took over a minute longer to fall unconscious when exposed to an anesthetic gas.

==Criticism==
Orch OR has been criticized both by physicists and neuroscientists who consider it to be a poor model of brain physiology. Orch OR has also been criticized for lacking explanatory power; the philosopher Patricia Churchland wrote, &quot;Pixie dust in the synapses is about as explanatorily powerful as quantum coherence in the microtubules.&quot;

David Chalmers argues against quantum consciousness. He instead discusses how quantum mechanics may relate to dualistic consciousness. Chalmers is skeptical that any new physics can resolve the hard problem of consciousness. He argues that quantum theories of consciousness suffer from the same weakness as more conventional theories. Just as he argues that there is no particular reason why particular macroscopic physical features in the brain should give rise to consciousness, he also thinks that there is no particular reason why a particular quantum feature, such as the EM field in the brain, should give rise to consciousness either.

===Decoherence in living organisms===
In 2000 Max Tegmark claimed that any quantum coherent system in the brain would undergo effective wave function collapse due to environmental interaction long before it could influence neural processes (the &quot;warm, wet and noisy&quot; argument, as it later came to be known). He determined the decoherence timescale of microtubule entanglement at brain temperatures to be on the order of femtoseconds, far too brief for neural processing. Christof Koch and Klaus Hepp also agreed that quantum coherence does not play, or does not need to play any major role in neurophysiology. Koch and Hepp concluded that &quot;The empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the &#x27;far-out&#x27; to the mere &#x27;very unlikely&#x27;.&quot;

In response to Tegmark&#x27;s claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch OR. As a result, Hameroff&#x27;s group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark&#x27;s, although still far below 25 ms. Hameroff&#x27;s group also suggested that the Debye layer of counterions could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin gel might enhance the ordering of water, further screening noise. They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of resisting quantum decoherence.

In 2009, Reimers &quot;et al.&quot; and McKemmish &quot;et al.,&quot; published critical assessments. Earlier versions of the theory had required tubulin-electrons to form either Bose–Einsteins or Frohlich condensates, and the Reimers group noted the lack of empirical evidence that such could occur. Additionally they calculated that microtubules could only support weak 8 MHz coherence. McKemmish &quot;et al.&quot; argued that aromatic molecules cannot switch states because they are delocalised; and that changes in tubulin protein-conformation driven by GTP conversion would result in a prohibitive energy requirement.

In 2022, a group of Italian physicists conducted several experiments that failed to provide evidence in support of a gravity-related quantum collapse model of consciousness, weakening the possibility of a quantum explanation for consciousness.

===Neuroscience===

Biology-based criticisms have been offered, including a lack of explanation for the probabilistic release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic axon terminals and an error in the calculated number of the tubulin dimers per cortical neuron.

In 2014, Penrose and Hameroff published responses to some criticisms and revisions to many of the theory&#x27;s peripheral assumptions, while retaining the core hypothesis.

<text>Volatility risk is the risk of an adverse change of price, due to changes in the volatility of a factor affecting that price. It usually applies to derivative instruments, and their portfolios, where the volatility of the underlying asset is a major influencer of option prices.
It is also relevant to portfolios of basic assets, and to foreign currency trading.

Volatility risk can be managed by hedging 
with appropriate financial instruments. 
These are volatility swaps, variance swaps, conditional variance swaps, variance options, VIX futures for equities, and (with some construction) caps, floors and swaptions for interest rates.

Here, the hedge-instrument is sensitive to the same source of volatility as the asset being protected (i.e. the same stock, commodity, or interest rate etc.).
The position is then established such that a change in the value of the protected-asset, is offset by a change in value of the hedge-instrument.
The number of hedge-instruments purchased, will be a function of the relative sensitivity to volatility of the two: 
the measure of sensitivity is &quot;vega&quot;, 
the rate of change of the value of the option, or option-portfolio, with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset.

Option traders often seek to create &quot;vega neutral&quot; positions, typically as part of an options trading strategy.

(The value of an at-the-money straddle, for example, is extremely dependent on changes to volatility.)
Here the total vega of the position is (near) zero — i.e. the impact of implied volatility is negated — allowing the trader to gain exposure to the specific opportunity, without concern for changing volatility.

<doc id="712259" wikidata="Q3926067" url="?curid=712259" title="Pyramid (magazine)">
<text>Pyramid was a US gaming magazine, publishing articles primarily on role-playing games, but including board games, card games, and other sorts of games. It began life in 1993 as a print publication of Steve Jackson Games for its first 30 issues, and was published on the Internet from March 1998. Print issues were bimonthly; the first online version published new articles each week; the second online version was monthly, published until December 2018. &quot;Pyramid&quot; was headquartered in Austin, Texas. It replaced Steve Jackson Games&#x27; previous magazine &quot;Roleplayer&quot;.

&quot;Pyramid&quot; published general gaming articles by freelance authors, as well as Designer&#x27;s Notes by Steve Jackson Games product developers, industry news, cartoons, and gaming product reviews. Although articles tended to concentrate on Steve Jackson Games products such as &quot;GURPS&quot;, it published articles on other games such as &quot;d20 System&quot;, &quot;Talisman&quot;, &quot;Nobilis&quot;, &quot;Hero System&quot;, and published various comic strips and single-panel cartoons. Steve Jackson Games also briefly published another online magazine, &quot;d20 Weekly&quot; for several months using a very similar model to that of &quot;Pyramid&quot;. However, the venture was not a success, and was eventually folded into a slightly expanded &quot;Pyramid&quot;.

The online subscription system used for &quot;Pyramid&quot; also granted access to subscriber forums, a dedicated chat server, and occasional pre-publication playtest material for Steve Jackson Games and other companies&#x27; products. In 2008 this was changed: Pyramid became available as a PDF download from e23 (online service), and the subscriber forums were discontinued.

In late 2018, it was announced on the &quot;Pyramid&quot; page of the Steven Jackson Games website that &quot;we are closing down &quot;Pyramid&quot; magazine later this year. The December 2018 issue will be the final issue of the magazine, and effective immediately, we are no longer accepting subscriptions.&quot;

==Publication history==
Shannon Appelcline noted that Steve Jackson Games stopped publishing &quot;Roleplayer&quot; magazine with issue #30 in 1993, &quot;but only so that Steve Jackson Games could start a new magazine. &quot;Pyramid&quot; debuted in May 1993. It was an ironic return to the generalist magazine industry—though it also promised to incorporate the SJG material that had once been printed in &quot;Autoduel Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Roleplayer&quot;.&quot; Appelcline noted that the magazine covered SJG games including &quot;Car Wars&quot;, but covered &quot;GURPS&quot; so strongly that &quot;SJG always had problems selling &quot;Pyramid&quot; as a non-house organ. Contrariwise &quot;Car Wars&quot; quickly faded away. The new magazine also looked quite nice, with glossy pages and some full color pages—luxuries that &quot;Space Gamer&quot; had enjoyed only briefly. It soon became entirely color, as SJG&#x27;s star continued to rise over the next few years.&quot; Appelcline concluded that Steve Jackson Games began &quot;having concerns over the profitability of publishing a generalist magazine. They finished up &quot;Pyramid&quot; print run with #30 (March/April 1998), and began publishing &#x27;volume two&#x27; of &quot;Pyramid&quot; as an online, weekly, subscription-based magazine and were able to successfully do so for 10 years.&quot; Appelcline also noted that as the company was moving to PDF publications, Steve Jackson Games ended the HTML second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; and reinvented it in 2008 as a PDF-only third volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot;.

<text>Akella () was a Russian software company specialising in the development, publishing and distribution of video games and multimedia products. The founders met in 1993 and decided to start a company together and in 1995 formed Akella. The company comprised five in-house development teams, a publishing house, a distribution center, a localisation team and a quality assurance department; in total, 250 people were employed by Akella. There were several sub-brands owned by Akella, i.e. Macho Studios that developed erotic games and published Japanese hentai dating sims.

The company is named after a Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Jungle Book character, Akela the wolf, and its logo is a wolf.

== Defunct status ==
During 2012, the company was amid multiple lawsuits totalling ₽200,000,000 (roughly $6,000,000) which, combined with the significant developmental difficulties and commercial failings of &quot;Postal III&quot;, pushed Akella to the verge of bankruptcy. As a result, the company, while technically still existing, has effectively ceased operations since 2012.

<text>Uxbridge Vine Street station opened on 8 September 1856 as &quot;Uxbridge Station&quot; and was the earliest of three railway stations in Uxbridge, London.

== History ==
When opened, it was the northern terminus of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Uxbridge branch from the main line at West Drayton. South from Uxbridge town centre, the line ran near Whitehall Road and Cleveland Road.

In 1863, a plan was approved to construct an extension of the Uxbridge Branch to create a link northwards to in Hertfordshire via , connecting it to the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&amp;RR). The scheme never went ahead as the GWR withdrew its funding.

In November 1885, the Staines West branch opened sharing a short section of the Vine Street branch to connect to the main line. An intermediate station at Cowley opened in 1904.

The Uxbridge Branch continued to be operated under British Rail until 10 September 1962, when the service from West Drayton was withdrawn and Uxbridge Vine Street station was closed to passengers. Goods traffic ceased two years later with the exception of the line south of the Grand Union Canal on which freight services were operated to the Middlesex Oil and Chemical Works in Yiewsley until 8 January 1979. Demolition of Uxbridge Vine Street station occurred in 1969. Hillingdon Road now covers its site.

<text>Uxbridge High Street railway station in Uxbridge, England, was on what is now Oxford Road near its junction with Sanderson Road. It was the southern terminus and only station on the Great Western Railway (GWR) branch line from the GWR/GCR joint line, which is now the Chiltern Main Line.

==History==

The station opened on 1 May 1907, with the intention that the branch was to be extended across the town to a point just south of Uxbridge Vine Street railway station, the terminus of the GWR branch from West Drayton. Some land was purchased and the lines extended over High Street on a bridge, but the proposal was abandoned in 1914.

Services were suspended between January 1917 and May 1920.
The branch ran along the west side of Shire Ditch and Frays River and through the centre of the present Denham Country Park. A triangular junction with the main line at the north end connected west towards Denham and east towards West Ruislip. The three junctions were named Denham South, Denham West and Denham East. The curve between the South and East Junctions was little used, and closed during World War I.

The locations of the curves joining the main line can be seen in the landscape today, forming the northern perimeters of the park&#x27;s northern lake and woodland adjacent to Uxbridge Golf Course.

The station closed to passengers on 25 September 1939, goods services continued until the station closed completely on 24 February 1964.


Most services from Uxbridge High Street ran to Denham via Denham West Junction, with some extended two stations further west to Gerrards Cross.

<text>Royal Albert DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in Beckton in east London. The station serves the western end of the north quay of the Royal Albert Dock, from which it takes its name. A view of the London City Airport is available.

The station is located on an elevated section of the DLR&#x27;s Beckton branch, between Prince Regent and Beckton Park stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==
The station was opened on 28 March 1994. There was previously a station called Connaught Road on the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway in the same area but this closed in 1940.

It was originally planned that in 2010 work would start on extending the platforms at Royal Albert to handle three-car trains, which are being introduced across the DLR. The extension would have been at the east end of the station, bringing the platforms closer to Royal Docks Road, although no new access steps were planned. The platforms have not however been extended, and although metal catwalks have been installed, these are too narrow for non-emergency use and Selective Door Operation is used instead.

2010 should have also seen Royal Albert served by a second DLR service. The existing route between Beckton and Tower Gateway would have been supplemented by a second service between Beckton and Stratford International via Canning Town using the new DLR tracks from Canning Town to Stratford International. However this extension was severely delayed and didn&#x27;t open until 31 August 2011.

== Services ==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Royal Albert is:
* 12 tph to of which 6 continue to Tower Gateway
* 12 tph to Beckton

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 16 tph in each direction.


==Design==
During disruption, Royal Albert acts as a terminus with a shuttle between Royal Albert and Beckton. This is possible because there is a crossover to the west of the station.

==Location==
The station is further from the nearest houses than any other on the DLR, despite which it has a steady patronage from those living in the area of Beckton to the north. In fact the station signage is subtitled &quot;For West Beckton&quot;. However, the access route from these houses to the station, crossing the busy Royal Albert Way on the level, is notably substandard, the only footbridge being some distance away.

Following the relocation of many London Borough of Newham council staff to the Building 1000 offices adjoining the station, usage has increased substantially during office hours.

The station serves the London Regatta Centre and Royal Docks Business Park which houses Newham Council.

London Buses routes 300 and 376 serves the station.

<text>Going Postal is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 33rd book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series, released in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2004. Unlike most of Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld novels, &quot;Going Postal&quot; is divided into chapters, a feature previously seen only in Pratchett&#x27;s children&#x27;s books and the Science of Discworld series. These chapters begin with a synopsis of philosophical themes, in a similar manner to some Victorian novels and, notably, to Jules Verne stories. The title refers to both the contents of the novel, as well as to the term &#x27;going postal&#x27;.

The book was on the shortlist for both the Nebula and Locus Awards for Best (Fantasy) Novel. It would also have been shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, except that Pratchett withdrew it, as he felt stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of the Worldcon. This was the first time Pratchett had been shortlisted for either award.

==Plot==
The story takes place in Ankh-Morpork, a powerful city-state on Discworld. The protagonist of the story is Moist von Lipwig, a skilled con artist who was to be hanged for his crimes, but saved at the last moment by the cunning and manipulative Patrician Havelock Vetinari, who has Moist&#x27;s death on the scaffold faked.

In his office, Vetinari presents Moist with two options: he may accept a job offer to become Postmaster of the city&#x27;s rundown Postal Service or he may choose to walk out of the door and never hear from Vetinari again. As exiting through the door in question would lead to a fatal drop, Moist decides to accept the job.

After a thwarted attempt at escape, Moist is brought to the Post Office by his parole officer Mr Pump, a golem. Moist learns that the Post Office has not functioned for decades, and the building is full of undelivered mail, concealed under a layer of pigeon dung. Only two employees remain: the aged Junior Postman Tolliver Groat and his assistant Stanley Howler.

Meanwhile, Vetinari is holding a meeting with the board executives of the Grand Trunk Company, a company that owns and operates a system of visual telegraph towers known as &quot;clacks&quot;. He notes that since they have taken full control, the quality of service had gone down considerably. Despite unnerving most of the board, Vetinari fails to make headway, especially with its chairman, Reacher Gilt. It is rumored that Reacher Gilt plans to usurp Vetinari as Patrician.

As Moist attempts to revitalise the postal service, he discovers that over the few months before taking the job, a number of his predecessors have predeceased in the building within weeks of each other in unusual circumstances. He also discovers that the mail inside the building has taken on a life of its own, and is nearly suffocated in a &quot;letterslide&quot;.

Moist introduces postage stamps to Ankh-Morpork, hires golems to deliver the mail, and finds himself competing against the Grand Trunk Clacks line. He meets and falls in love with the chain-smoking golem-rights activist Adora Belle Dearheart, and the two begin a relationship by the end of the book. Dearheart is the daughter of the Clacks founder Robert Dearheart, though the company was taken away from her father and the other founders by tricky financial manoeuvring. She still has useful contacts amongst the clacks operators.

Gilt sets a banshee assassin (Mr Gryle) on the Postmaster, but only manages to burn down much of the Post Office building. The banshee dies when he is flipped onto the space-warping sorting machine. Lipwig makes an outrageous wager with Gilt that he can deliver a message to Genua, 2000 miles from Ankh-Morpork, faster than the Grand Trunk can. &quot;The Smoking Gnu&quot;, a group of clacks-crackers, sets up a plan to send &#x27;...the woodpecker&#x27; (a Discworld equivalent to a killer poke) into the clacks system that will destroy the machinery, halting the message that Lipwig will race against. Lipwig talks the Gnu out of it, doubting its effectiveness in the face of professional clacks operators and wanting to leave the semaphore towers standing. Instead, Lipwig and the Gnu, using Trunk documents in Adora Belle&#x27;s possession, intercept the message and replace it with a fake message from the dead which reveals the crimes of Gilt and the Grand Trunk board of directors. This plan succeeds.

Gilt is eventually arrested and finds himself in front of the Patrician, who offers a similar choice to the one Moist faced in the beginning of the book: run the mint or exit the room. Gilt, however, chooses to walk through the door to his death.

==TV adaptation==
Sky One produced a two-part television film, &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Going Postal&quot;, which aired on 30–31 May 2010.

== Legacy ==
Based on a plot idea in this novel, after Terry Pratchett&#x27;s death some websites remember him via a special HTML header line.

<text>László Rajk (8 March 1909 – 15 October 1949) was a Hungarian Communist politician, who served as Minister of Interior and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was an important organizer of the Hungarian Communists&#x27; power (for example, organizing the State Protection Authority (ÁVH)), but he eventually fell victim to Mátyás Rákosi&#x27;s show trials.

==Background==

Born in Székelyudvarhely, the ninth of eleven children in a family of Transylvanian Saxons, his ties to Communism began at an early age when he became a member of the Communist Party of Hungary (KMP).

Later he was expelled from his university for his political ideas and would become a building worker, until 1936 when he joined the Popular Front in the Spanish Civil War. He became commissar of the Rakosi Battalion of XIII International Brigade. After the collapse of Republican Spain, he was interned in France until 1941, when he was finally able to return to Hungary, where he became Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, an underground Communist movement.

In December 1944 he was arrested by a detachment of the Arrow Cross Party. He was to be executed, and was transported to the prison of Sopronkőhida, then into Germany; but the intercession of his elder brother, Endre, a fascist under-secretary, saved his life. László Rajk was released on 13 May 1945.

He went home to Hungary and took part in party politics. He became a member of all the leader corporations of the party (MKP) and the Extemporal Parliament. Rajk was a member of the High National Council from 7 December 1945 to 2 February 1946. On 20 March 1946 he was appointed minister of the Interior. In this post he organized the Hungarian Communist Party&#x27;s private army and secret police (an organization analogous to the KGB, Securitate, Stasi and so on), the ÁVH (originally ÁVO), and he became directly responsible for this. Under the cover of &quot;struggle against fascism and reaction&quot; and &quot;defence of the power of proletariat&quot;, he prohibited and liquidated several religious, nationalist, and maverick establishments and groups (the number of these was about 1,500), and set up the first show trials.

He was reassigned from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 5 August 1948 to 30 May 1949. Rákosi, who saw Rajk as a threat to his power, decided to accuse him on false charges and had him arrested on 30 May 1949 on trumped-up charges. Rajk, who was popular among the Communists before, soon became the &quot;chained dog&quot; of Tito, Horthy and &quot;the imperialist&quot;.

==Trial==
László Rajk was accused of being a &quot;Titoist Spy&quot;, an agent for western imperialism and one who planned on restoring capitalism and jeopardizing Hungary&#x27;s independence. During his time in prison, Rajk was tortured and was promised acquittal if he took responsibility for the charges brought against him. Stalin&#x27;s NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary Mátyás Rákosi and his ÁVH to orchestrate Rajk&#x27;s show trial.

At his trial, held between 16 and 24 September 1949, in the large assembly hall of the headquarters of the Metal and Engineering Workers&#x27; Trade Union in Budapest, he confessed to all the charges brought against him. After his confession the prosecution decided, against the promise made, to call for the heaviest sentences to be brought down upon him and the other seven men who stood trial with him. Rajk was to be made an example for the beginning of Stalin&#x27;s anti-Titoist purges. Rajk, along with Drs Tibor Szönyi and András Szalai, was sentenced to death. Rajk was executed on 15 October 1949.

==Post-trial/reburial==
The Rajk trial marked the beginning of the anti-Titoist drive movement of Stalin. His trial also marked the beginning of the removal of all political parties in Hungary. The purges, however, left the economy in a truly disastrous state whereby a lack of capital inflow doomed the building projects that were underway. A vast number of the intelligentsia were then employed on the sort of manual labouring duties usually reserved for skilled professionals. The result left the country with an inadequate infrastructure and unsatisfactorily manufactured goods. The government was also using too many men to search for spies within the country and not enough to perform the productive work to sustain the economy.

Dissatisfaction with Rákosi&#x27;s rule began to surface. On 28 March 1956, following numerous demonstrations, Rajk was rehabilitated in spite of his responsibility for the excesses of the secret police ÁVH which he had founded in 1946, including initial large purges and executions under his direction. The rehabilitation speech, even though it was not publicized, had vast consequences for Rákosi, who had used the Rajk guilt as an explanation for the other purges that followed. Now that he had to admit that he was, indeed, wrong, it would end up ruining Rákosi&#x27;s rightful authority. Lászlo Rajk was then reburied, before 100,000 mourners, on 6 October 1956, along with two other men who lost their lives during the purges. (This was a precursor to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which began on 23 October.) Júlia Rajk&#x27;s commitment to rehabilitating her late husband&#x27;s reputation was instrumental to the large turnout for the funeral.

==List of defendants in the Rajk trial==
*László Rajk (born in 1909), Minister of Foreign Affairs (executed)
*György Pálffy (1909), Lieutenant General (sentence deferred to military court, executed)
*Lazar Brankov (1912), Counsellor, Yugoslav Legation (life imprisonment)

*Milan Ognjenovich (1916), government official (9 years)
*Béla Korondy (1914), Police Colonel (sentence deferred to military court, executed)
*Pál Justus (1905), member of the National Assembly (life imprisonment)

15 people were executed and 78 others were sentenced to prison in relation to the Rajk case.

== Play ==
László Rajk: the events of his political and family life, beginning circa 1945, his trial, execution, reburial, atonement, and ending with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the USSR&#x27;s armed invasion of Hungary, are all portrayed in Robert Ardrey&#x27;s 1958 play, &quot;Shadow of Heroes&quot;.

<text>Alone in the Dark is a survival horror video game series originally developed by Infogrames. In most of the games, the player controls private investigator Edward Carnby, who goes to investigate a haunted house or town that is full of undead creatures.

The series, particularly for its debut game, is widely acknowledged as an early instance of survival horror video games and (along with &quot;Sweet Home&quot;) is often credited with the creation of the genre. The original story was based on the writings of H. P. Lovecraft; later games in the series drew inspiration from other sources including voodoo, the Wild West, and the works of H. R. Giger. Seven installments of the series have been created, with various themes and locations. Two comic books and two films were created based upon the games.

In September 2018, Atari SA sold the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; franchise to THQ Nordic.

==Games==

=== Main series ===
===&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (1992)===

The first game in the series was developed by Infogrames and released for PC in 1992. It was one of the first two games to use polygonal characters over pre-rendered backgrounds. Guinness World Records awarded it the record of &quot;First Ever 3D Survival Horror Game&quot; in the Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008 edition. Krisalis Software made a port for the 3DO in 1994 that was released by Interplay Entertainment. A Mac version was released in 1994. In 2014, Atari published a port to iOS developed by Kung Fu Factory but was pulled out of the App Store after the latest iOS updates.

===&quot;Jack in the Dark&quot; (1993)===
A small game made during the second game&#x27;s production, &quot;Jack in the Dark&quot;, was used as a promotional game distributed during Christmas of 1993, just before the second installment&#x27;s release. The game was on a single floppy disk in a golden wrapping featuring a Jack-in-the-box illustration on the top. It is a short adventure featuring the young child Grace Saunders. During Halloween, she enters a small toy store after dark and gets locked inside. There, the toys are alive, and Grace must save Santa Claus from an evil Jack-in-the-box. &quot;Jack in the Dark&quot; is an adventure game that focuses purely on puzzles and has no combat. Later CD versions of both &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; came packaged with this game.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; (1993)===

Developed by Infogrames and released for PC in 1993, &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; was a drastic departure from the original game, being more action-oriented than its predecessor, with a much greater emphasis on firearms and shootouts, and resulting in more difficult combat. Like the original, it was ported to the 3DO by Krisalis and released by Interplay. An enhanced port under the name of &quot;Alone in the Dark: Jack is Back&quot; (&quot;Alone in the Dark: One-Eyed Jack&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in the United States) was released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Both versions were also released in Japan under the original name.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark 3&quot; (1995)===

&quot;Alone in the Dark 3&quot; was the last game to utilize the same engine and characters as the original game. Released for PC in 1995, the game returned to the gameplay style of the original game. A version of the game for Windows 95 was released as &quot;Alone in the Dark: Ghosts in Town&quot; in 1996.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot; (2001)===

The next generation game of the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; series was created by Darkworks as a console survival horror title, and shows significant influence from the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. The control scheme and gameplay are much closer to that of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; than the original &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; games. Internally known as &quot;Alone in the Dark 4&quot;, the game was released in 2001, developed by Darkworks for the PlayStation and Dreamcast, and by Spiral Studios for PC and PlayStation 2, also with an alternative portable Game Boy Color version developed by Pocket Studios. The game unlike its predecessors is set in modern settings, features new main character design and no longer features Savate as unarmed combat method.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2008)===

Developed by Eden Games for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and by Hydravision Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; changed the focus of the series back to survival horror. Initially known as &quot;Alone in the Dark: Near Death Investigation&quot;, the game was re-branded as &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; despite having few connections with the original game. The game introduced 3D generated scenarios and interchangeable first and third-person view to the series. The environment plays a large role in core gameplay; any object, even decorative, can be used as a melee weapon or combined to make different styles of weapons. The PlayStation 3 version was released several months after the other versions as &quot;Alone in the Dark: Inferno&quot;. It had a few gameplay changes and fewer glitches.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark: Illumination&quot; (2015)===

&quot;Alone in the Dark: Illumination&quot; was released on June 11, 2015. Unlike the previous installments, the game is only played online. The game was heavily panned by critics.

===&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2024)===

Developed by Pieces Interactive, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; is a reimagining of the original 1992 video game in a similar style to the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; remakes. The game features a single-player narrative set in the 1920s, where players can choose to play as Edward Carnby (David Harbour) or Emily Hartwood (Jodie Comer), as they make their way through Derceto Mansion to uncover the mysteries within. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 20, 2024.

==Storyline==


Edward Carnby is the main protagonist of the series, and is a private detective. In the first three games, he is depicted as a middle-aged private investigator during the 1920s. &quot;The New Nightmare&quot; depicts him as a younger adult in 2001. In the 2008 installment of the series, Carnby&#x27;s appearance was drastically changed. He has been the main protagonist in every game to date, with the exception of the mini game, &quot;Jack in the Dark&quot;, which instead features Grace Saunders, a character who appears in &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot;. He is also the main character in two movies loosely based upon the games.

The three original games take place in the 1920s and depict the paranormal cases of private eye Edward Carnby. In 1924 (&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;) he is commissioned by an antique dealer to investigate a piano in the loft of the Louisiana mansion Derceto, which was abandoned after its owner Jeremy Hartwood committed suicide. On Christmas Eve 1924 (&quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot;) Carnby goes on to solve a case involving the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders after the investigating procedures of his deceased partner Ted Stryker, with all the clues leading to an old California mansion named &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and an infamous gangster who inhabited it. In July 1925 (&quot;Alone in the Dark 3&quot;) he is called to investigate the disappearance of a film crew at a two-bit ghost town known by the name of Slaughter Gulch located in the Mojave Desert in California. The first game shares the protagonist role with Jeremy Hartwood&#x27;s niece, Emily Hartwood, who also takes a role of damsel-in-distress in &quot;Alone in the Dark 3&quot;.

In &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot; Carnby is investigating the death of his best friend, Charles Fiske. He teams up with Aline Cedrac, a young University professor specializing in ancient Indian languages, on a mission to Shadow Island. When &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot; was made, the setting was moved from the 1920s to 2001, and a background legend was made up in order to explain that Edward Carnby belonged to a lineage of Shadow Hunters who were born the 29th of February of every 40 years and raised as orphan children in St George&#x27;s Orphanage, all of them going by the name of Edward Carnby. The name is depicted as a literal anglicized form of &quot;El War Qarn&#x27;bi&quot;, which means &quot;the one who battles evil incarnate and hunts out the shadows&quot;. According to this legend, the original Edward Carnby was born in 1888 and went out of record after engaging several strange affairs in the years 1920 to 1939. The Edward Carnby that plays the main role in &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot; was born in 1968.

The 2008 &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; reinterpreted once again the series storyline. It follows the canon of the first three games, and ignores the events of &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot;. The story takes place in Central Park, New York, both inside the park and in its surroundings. Taking place in 2008, the game claims that there has only ever been one Edward Carnby, who has been possessed since the late 1920s, and is now over 100 years old, though he retains a youthful appearance.

&quot;Alone in the Dark: Illumination&quot; takes place in the mining town of Lorwich, Virginia and harkens back to the series&#x27; Lovecraftian background. Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Carnby, one of &quot;Illumination&quot;&#x27;s four protagonists, is a direct descendent of Edward Carnby. Ted is actually implied to be Edward Carnby himself living under an assumed identity, still alive in the modern era due to the events of the 2008 &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; game.

==Development==
The original game engine was created by Frédérick Raynal as a pet project while working at Infogrames. With the help of Didier Chanfray, who made the 3D models, a working prototype of the attic (the game&#x27;s first room) was designed. An internal contest was held to create the art to complete the 3D prototype. Yaël Barroz&#x27;s art was selected and she was introduced into the game&#x27;s core team. Frédérick Raynal directed the project.

Shortly after &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;&#x27;s initial release, a major disagreement between the team and Infogrames&#x27; director (Bruno Bonnell) took place regarding the direction of the sequel. As a result, most of the original team left Infogrames to create a new studio named Adeline Software International.

According to an interview made just after the release of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, portions of the sequels were designed by the original team before leaving. The interview presented a sketch of the house that was used in the sequel and mentioned the fact that Carnby could be dressed as Santa Claus.

The original game&#x27;s engine is the first known to use interpolated animation, relying on the computer to render the frames between key frames. This approach has the advantages of reducing the game&#x27;s memory footprint (requiring less memory to store) and adapting to each computer&#x27;s power.

The game engine developed for &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was reused in its first two sequels (&quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot; and &quot;Alone in the Dark 3&quot;) without substantial changes. Infogrames updated it for use in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Time Gate: Knight&#x27;s Chase&quot;.

==Adaptations==

=== Films ===
In 2005, an &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; film was released starring Christian Slater as Edward Carnby. The film has little-to-no relation to the games from the 1990s or the 2008 continuation. The film is known as one of the worst ever made. Guinness World Records named the film the &quot;Lowest-Grossing Game Based Movie&quot; in Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008.
In 2009, a low-budget sequel titled &quot;Alone in the Dark II&quot; was released, starring Rick Yune as Edward Carnby and featuring an entirely new cast and a story centered on witch hunting.

=== Comic ===
An &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; one-shot comic book entitled &quot;Life is a Hideous Thing&quot; was published by Semic Comics in 2001 in France and translated by Image Comics in the U.S. in September 2002. It was also translated and published in Italy and Spain. Written by Jean-Marc Lofficier and drawn by Matt Haley and Aleksi Briclot, it takes place just before &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot;. It stars Edward Carnby and introduces Aline Cedrac, both on the trail of a mysterious lost city of Aggartha in Tibet. The comic also features Frank Stone, a young scientist who accompanies Aline, Ganesha, a fortune hunter, and Dr. Leng, a wise man who lives in his private flying ship along with his beautiful assistant Monplaisir (the two characters also appear in a French comic book based on &quot;Motor Mayhem&quot;).

The characters travel to Aggartha in order to destroy the Crown of Genghis Khan, a powerful artifact able to summon a powerful creature known as the Creeping Chaos. Frank Stone is revealed to be possessed by a demon, and unleashes the Creeping Chaos. Its up to Carnby and Cedrac to defeat him and cast the creature back. The Creeping Chaos&#x27;s appearance is based on a deity from Lovecraft&#x27;s lore, Shub-Niggurath.

<text>Joseph Brown (26 September 1930 – 15 April 2020) was an English mountaineer who was regarded as an outstanding pioneer of rock climbing during the 1950s and early 1960s. Together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, he was one of a new breed of British post-war climbers who came from working class backgrounds in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the Second World War. He became the first person to climb the third-highest mountain in the world when he was on the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. Some of his climbs were televised and he assisted with mountaineering scenes in several films; Brown died on 15 April 2020 at the age of 89.

==Early life==
Brown was born the seventh and last child of a family in Ardwick, Manchester, England. His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown&#x27;s mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his autobiography, &quot;The Hard Years&quot;, Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside: camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around the age of 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus&#x27; &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Climbing&quot;, he decided to begin climbing. He reputedly borrowed his mother&#x27;s old washing line to use as a rope, but Brown himself explained that, in fact, he stole rope that had been placed around roadworks.

After leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a plumber and general builder called Archie. In 1949–50, he was conscripted for 18 months in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later.

==Climbing career==
Brown, who was known as &quot;The Master&quot; and &quot;The Human Fly&quot;, became famous for climbing during the 1950s. He was a member of the Valkyrie Climbing Club and founding member of the Rock and Ice Club. In &quot;Hard Rock&quot;, Ken Wilson said of Brown: &quot;The reader may gain some idea of his ability by studying those of his climbs featured in this book. He has brought to climbing a rare combination of attributes: keenness, patience, strength, technical ability, eye for a line, competitiveness and, above all, a subtle and mysterious charisma. Few would deny that his place in British rock climbing remains pre-eminent.&quot; Reviewing Brown&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Hard Years&quot; in 1967, the climber A. B. Hargreaves said: &quot;This is a remarkable book by a remarkable man. As for the man, the hard man, the climber, his achievements both in rock climbing and mountaineering have been very great. In twenty years he has become a legend&quot;.

An early climbing partner was Don Whillans, from the neighbouring city of Salford. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from working class backgrounds, in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the Second World War. So famous was he that the Post Office delivered a letter to him simply addressed &quot;The Human Fly, UK&quot;.

Brown established a number of new routes in Snowdonia and the Peak District that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. Examples on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass include &quot;Cenotaph Corner&quot; (1952, graded E1, with Doug Belshaw) and &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; (1951, E1, with Don Whillans).

Brown&#x27;s mountaineering achievements in the Alps and Himalayas included many ascents in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world&#x27;s third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga in the Nepalese Himalayas, with George Band. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the Muztagh Tower in the Karakoram with Ian McNaught-Davis. The other members of the team, John Hartog and Tom Patey, reached the main summit the next day.

As well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of &quot;protection&quot; to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first &quot;nuts&quot; by drilling the thread out of engineering nuts and threading the centre with a sling. He started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened a shop, since expanded to three shops in Snowdonia and an online store.

==Personal life==
On 17 February 1957, Brown married Valerie Melville Gray. They had two daughters.

On 15 April 2020, Brown died at his home in Llanberis, aged 89.

== Honours ==
Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and in 2011 was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the New Year&#x27;s Honours List for services to rock climbing and mountaineering. Upon receiving the CBE, the BBC reported him as saying: &quot;Receiving the CBE is so strange, because it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m being awarded for enjoying myself&quot;.

== In the media ==
Throughout his climbing career Brown was involved in films such as &quot;Hazard&quot;, &quot;Upside Down Wales&quot;, &quot;Five Days One Summer&quot;, in which he and other British climbers assisted with the mountaineering scenes. In 1986 he was the stunt double for Robert De Niro during the climbing scenes in &quot;The Mission&quot;.

Brown is remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s, three in Snowdonia, and in 1967, a spectacular new route on the Old Man of Hoy, a Scottish sea stack, with Ian McNaught-Davis and Chris Bonington, which was broadcast live by the BBC. In 1984 Brown repeated the climb of the Old Man in a television documentary.

In his 2010 book &quot;Unjustifiable Risk?: The Story of British Climbing&quot;, Simon Thompson, says of Brown: &quot;Joe Brown is regarded by many as the finest British climber of the twentieth century&quot;.

<text>Nadia is a female name. Variations include Nadja, Nadya, Nadine, Nadiya, and Nadiia. Most variations of the name are derived from Arabic, Slavic languages, or both.

In many Slavic languages, names similar to &quot;Nadia&quot; mean &quot;hope&quot;: Ukrainian &quot;Nadiya&quot; (Надія, accent on the &quot;i&quot;), Czech &quot;Naďa&quot;, Belarusian &quot;Nadzieja&quot; (Надзея, accent on the &quot;e&quot;), and Old Polish &quot;Nadzieja&quot;, all of which are derived from Proto-Slavic &quot;*naděja&quot;, the first three from Old East Slavic. In Bulgarian and Russian, on the other hand, Nadia or Nadya (Надя, accent on first syllable) is the diminutive form of the full name Nadezhda (Надежда), meaning &quot;hope&quot; and derived from Old Church Slavonic, which it entered as a translation of the Greek word &quot;ἐλπίς&quot; (Elpis), with the same meaning; in those languages, Nadia often is used as a full name in its own right.

In Arabic, the name is &quot;Nadiyyah&quot;, meaning &quot;tender&quot; and &quot;delicate.&quot; In the Dan language, the word &quot;Nãdienã&quot; simply means &quot;girl&quot;.

<text>Microsoft Visual InterDev, is a discontinued Integrated development environment used to create web applications using Microsoft Active Server Pages. It was distributed as part of Microsoft Visual Studio 97 &amp; 6.0 and was, to some extent, replaced by Microsoft Visual Studio .NET and ASP.NET.

Visual Interdev could be used to create simple HTML-based Web pages, with code completion and syntax highlighting, to complete data-driven web applications using Interdev&#x27;s proprietary components alongside Microsoft&#x27;s web server software.It featured database integration &amp; server management and the VBScript and JScript scripting languages with an integrated debugger.

The extensive InterDev IDE is shared with Microsoft Visual J++, and is the precursor to Visual Studio .NET. The InterDev IDE is also used as the script editor in Microsoft Office 2000 (see Microsoft Script Editor.

Visual Interdev was replaced by the web development toolset that is integrated into the main Visual Studio product.

<doc id="712306" wikidata="Q930343" url="?curid=712306" title="Catafalque">
<text>A catafalque is a raised bier, box, or similar platform, often movable, that is used to support the casket, coffin, or body of a dead person during a Christian funeral or memorial service. Following a Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, a catafalque may be used to stand in place of the body at the absolution of the dead or used during Masses of the Dead and All Souls&#x27; Day.

== Etymology ==
According to Peter Stanford, the term originates from the Italian &#x27;, which means scaffolding. However, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says the word is &quot;[o]f unknown derivation; even the original form is uncertain; French pointing to or , Italian to , Spanish to .&quot; The most notable Italian catafalque was the one designed for Michelangelo by his fellow artists in 1564. An elaborate and highly decorated roofed surround for a catafalque, common for grand funerals of the Baroque era, may be called a &#x27;.

== Papal catafalques ==
Large processions have followed the catafalques of popes. The households of the cardinals carried the catafalque of Pope Sixtus V in 1590. The bier, decorated with gold cloth, was followed by &quot;confraternities, religious orders, students of seminaries and colleges, orphans and mendicants&quot;. In 1963, a million people filed past the catafalque of Pope John XXIII, which had been carried in procession to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.
In Catholic Liturgy, the catafalque is either an empty casket or a wooden form made to look like a casket that is covered by the black pall and surrounded by six unbleached (orange) candles (when they are available); it is a symbolic representation of the deceased or a monument erected to represent the faithful departed. When it is present, the priest sings the absolution for the deceased as if the body was present.

== Notable catafalques ==

Other than religious leaders such as popes, famous people have lain in state or been carried in procession to their burial place on a catafalque.

=== Voltaire ===
Thirteen years after his death, the remains of Voltaire were transferred on a catafalque to the Panthéon in Paris, a building dedicated to the great men of the French nation. It bore the inscription: &quot;Poet, philosopher, historian, he made a great step forward in the human spirit. He prepared us to become free.&quot;

=== Abraham Lincoln ===

The Lincoln catafalque, first used for United States President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral in 1865, has been used for all those who have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda since Lincoln&#x27;s death, the most recent of which were Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans on April 13, 2021, and U.S. Senator Bob Dole on December 9, 2021. It has recently been used at the state funeral for Jimmy Carter in the Capitol rotunda in January 2025. It was later moved to the portico of the Court for public viewing. When not in use, the catafalque is kept on display in the Exhibition Hall at the United States Capitol Visitor Center. Commentators noted that the structure of the original pine timbers and boards has been reinforced, albeit being left &quot;original&quot;.

<doc id="712313" wikidata="Q411325" url="?curid=712313" title="Atenolol">
<text>Atenolol is a beta blocker medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart-associated chest pain. Although used to treat high blood pressure, it does not seem to improve mortality in those with the condition. Other uses include the prevention of migraines and treatment of certain irregular heart beats. It is taken orally (by mouth) or by intravenous injection (injection into a vein). It can also be used with other blood pressure medications.
Common side effects include feeling tired, heart failure, dizziness, depression, and shortness of breath. Other serious side effects include bronchial spasm. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and alternative drugs are preferred when breastfeeding. It works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, thus decreasing heart rate, force of heart beats, and blood pressure.
Atenolol was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1975. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 63rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including hyperthyroidism, hypertension, angina, long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, essential tremor (ET), and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

The role for β-blockers in general in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, as they are less appropriate than other agents such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers, particularly in the elderly.

===Available forms===
Atenolol is available in the form of 25, 50, and 100mg oral tablets. It is also available in the form of oral tablets containing a combination of 50 or 100mg atenolol and 50mg chlortalidone. Atenolol was previously available in a 0.5mg/mL solution for injection as well, but this formulation was discontinued.

==Side effects==
Hypertension treated with a β-blocker such as atenolol, alone or in conjunction with a thiazide diuretic, is associated with a higher incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those treated with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.

β-blockers, of which atenolol is mainly studied, provides weaker protection against stroke and mortality in patients over 60 years old compared to other antihypertensive medications. Diuretics may be associated with better cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes than β-blockers in the elderly.

Rarely, atenolol has been associated with induction of acute delirium.

==Overdose==
Symptoms of overdose are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on β1 and also β2-receptors. These include bradycardia (slow heartbeat), severe hypotension with shock, acute heart failure, hypoglycemia and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. Activated charcoal is useful to absorb the drug. Atropine will counteract bradycardia, glucagon helps with hypoglycemia, dobutamine can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a β2-mimetic such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3–30 mg/L in overdose victims.

==Interactions==
Interactions with atenolol include catecholamine-depleting drugs like reserpine, calcium channel blockers, disopyramide, amiodarone, clonidine, prostaglandin synthase inhibitors like indomethacin, and digitalis glycosides. Most of these interactions involve either additive cardiovascular effects or reduction of atenolol&#x27;s effects.

Atenolol is mainly eliminated renally without being metabolized by the liver or by cytochrome P450 enzymes. As a result, it has little or no potential for cytochrome P450-related drug interactions, for instance with inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. Accordingly, the broad/non-selective cytochrome P450 inhibitor cimetidine had no effect on atenolol levels, whereas cimetidine has been found to significantly increase metoprolol and propranolol levels.

Beta blockers like atenolol can reduce or block the cardiovascular effects of sympathomimetics and amphetamines, such as hypertension and tachycardia.

Atenolol has been found to be safe in combination with the non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine and actually improved orthostatic hypotension and hypertensive reactions with phenelzine. However, more research is still needed to assess whether addition of a beta blocker like atenolol to MAOI therapy is safe and effective for improving orthostatic hypotension with MAOIs.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Atenolol is a beta blocker; that is, an antagonist of the β-adrenergic receptors. It is specifically a selective antagonist of the β1-adrenergic receptor with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (i.e., partial agonist activity) or membrane-stabilizing activity. However, the preferential action of atenolol is not absolute, and at high doses, it can also block β2-adrenergic receptors.

Beta-blocking effects of atenolol include reduction in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and with exercise, inhibition of tachycardia induced by isoproterenol (a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor agonist), and reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.

The beta-blocking effects of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise-related tachycardia, are apparent within 1hour and are maximal within 2 to 4hours following a single oral dose. The general effects of atenolol, including beta-blocking and antihypertensive effects, last for at least 24hours following oral doses of 50 or 100mg. With intravenous administration, maximal reduction in exercise-related tachycardia occurs within 5minutes and following a single 10mg dose has dissipated within 12hours. The duration of action of atenolol is dose-related and is correlated with circulating levels of atenolol.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
The oral bioavailability of atenolol is approximately 50 to 60%. The absorption of atenolol with oral administration is rapid and consistent but is incomplete. About 50% of an oral dose of atenolol is absorbed from the intestines, with the rest excreted in feces. Maximal concentrations of atenolol occur 2 to 4hours following an oral dose, whereas peak concentrations occur within 5minutes with intravenous administration. The pharmacokinetic profile of atenolol results in it having relatively consistent plasma drug levels with about 4-fold variation between individuals.

====Distribution====
The plasma protein binding of atenolol is 6 to 16%.

Atenolol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier and entering the brain. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Only small amounts of atenolol are said to enter the brain. The brain-to-blood ratio of atenolol was 0.2 : 1 in one study, whereas the ratio for propranolol was 33 : 1 in the same study.

====Metabolism====
Atenolol undergoes minimal or negligible metabolism by the liver. It has been estimated that about 5% of atenolol is metabolized. This is in contrast to other beta blockers like propranolol and metoprolol, but is similar to nadolol. In accordance with its lack of hepatic metabolism, the pharmacokinetics of atenolol are not altered in hepatic impairment, unlike the case of propranolol. Two metabolites of atenolol have been identified: hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide. It has been said that it is unknown if these metabolites are active. However, another source stated that hydroxyatenolol has one-tenth the beta-blocking activity of atenolol.

====Elimination====
Instead of by hepatic metabolism, atenolol is eliminated from the blood mainly via renal excretion. Atenolol is excreted about 40 to 50% in urine and 50% in feces with oral administration. Conversely, it is excreted 85 to 100% in urine unchanged and 10% in feces with intravenous administration. Only very small amounts of hydroxyatenolol and atenolol glucuronide are found in urine with atenolol.

The elimination half-life of atenolol is about 6 to 7hours. The half-life of atenolol does not change with continuous administration. With intravenous administration, atenolol levels rapidly decline (5- to 10-fold) during the first 7hours and thereafter decline at a rate similar to that with oral administration.

The elimination of atenolol is slowed in renal impairment, with the elimination rate being closely related to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with significant accumulation occurring when the creatinine clearance rate is under 35mL/min/1.73m2. At a GFR of less than 10mL/min, the half-life of atenolol increases up to 36hours.

==Chemistry==
Atenolol is a substituted phenethylamine derivative. It is specifically β-phenylethylamine with an α-keto substitution and a 4- substitution on the phenyl ring.

The experimental log P of atenolol is 0.16 and its predicted log P ranges from −0.03 to 0.57.

Atenolol is closely structurally related to metoprolol and certain other beta blockers. It is also structurally related to the catecholamine neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).

==Society and culture==
===Changing medical practices===
Atenolol has been given as an example of how slow healthcare providers are to change their prescribing practices in the face of medical evidence that indicates that a drug is not as effective as others in treating some conditions. In 2012, 33.8 million prescriptions were written to American patients for this drug. In 2014, it was in the top (most common) 1% of drugs prescribed to Medicare patients. Although the number of prescriptions has been declining steadily since limited evidence articles contesting its efficacy was published, it has been estimated that it would take 20 years for doctors to stop prescribing it for hypertension. Despite its diminished efficacy when compared to newer antihypertensive drugs, atenolol and other beta blockers are still a relevant clinical choice for treating some conditions, since beta blockers are a diverse group of medicines with different properties that still requires further research. As consequence, reasons for the popularity of beta blockers cannot be fully attributed to a slow healthcare system – patient compliance factor, such as treatment cost and duration, also affect adherence and popularity of therapy.

<text>Finnish hip hop or rap () or (&quot;suomirap, rap&quot;) is a variant of hip hop music from Finland. The rapping (räppääminen) is mainly done in Finnish. Many rappers use Helsinki slang words; general slang and Finnish dialects are used too by some artists. Many early rappers () used English. Some Finnish rap was already recorded in the early 1980s and some popular artists 1990s but it was not until the 2000s that it finally reached mainstream popularity.

The first recorded Finnish rap song was &quot;I&#x27;m Young, Beautiful and Natural&quot; in English, which was made by an artist called General Njassa in 1983. Rap music in Finnish made its first breakthrough in 1990 when groups Raptori and Pääkköset and artist Nikke T got their records to Finnish charts. Raptori in particular became a nationwide phenomenon. These artists had a style greatly different when compared to American rap music. Their music was highly influenced by the dance-pop of the 1980s and their approach to music was largely humoristic. Later Finnish rappers tend to despise this wave of the early 1990s. Niko Toiskallio (Nikke T) himself has later stated that he regrets his humoristic dance-influenced rap recordings and he claims that so-called humour-rap deprived the credibility of Finnish rap scene which did not recover until many years later in the late 1990s.

<doc id="712319" wikidata="Q194520" url="?curid=712319" title="Atrophy">
<text>Atrophy is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body. Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor circulation, loss of hormonal support, loss of nerve supply to the target organ, excessive amount of apoptosis of cells, and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have &quot;trophic&quot; effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as &quot;atrophy&quot;. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell, organ or tissue, after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast, hypoplasia is the reduction in the cellular numbers of an organ, or tissue that has not attained normal maturity.

Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues, involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support because of other diseases, it is termed &quot;pathological atrophy&quot;, although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well.

==Normal development==

Examples of atrophy as part of normal development include shrinking and the involution of the thymus in early childhood, and the tonsils in adolescence. In old age, effects include, but are not limited to, loss of teeth, hair, thinning of skin that creates wrinkles, weakening of muscles, loss of weight in organs and sluggish mental activity.

==Muscle atrophies==
&quot;Disuse atrophy&quot; of muscles and bones, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after prolonged immobility, such as extended bedrest, or having a body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.). This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe.

There are many diseases and conditions which cause atrophy of muscle mass. For example, diseases such as cancer and AIDS induce a body wasting syndrome called &quot;cachexia&quot;, which is notable for the severe muscle atrophy seen. Other syndromes or conditions which can induce skeletal muscle atrophy are congestive heart failure and liver disease.

During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass. This condition is called &quot;sarcopenia&quot;, and may be distinct from atrophy in its pathophysiology. While the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, it may be induced by a combination of a gradual failure in the satellite cells which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.

== Dystrophies, myositis, and motor neuron conditions ==

Pathologic atrophy of muscles can occur with diseases of the motor nerves or diseases of the muscle tissue itself. Examples of atrophying nerve diseases include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease), and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Examples of atrophying muscle diseases include muscular dystrophy, myotonia congenita, and myotonic dystrophy.

Changes in Na+ channel isoform expression and spontaneous activity in muscle called fibrillation can also result in muscle atrophy.

A flail limb is a medical term which refers to an extremity in which the primary nerve has been severed, resulting in complete lack of mobility and sensation. The muscles soon wither away from atrophy.

==Gland atrophy==

The adrenal glands atrophy during prolonged use of exogenous glucocorticoids like prednisone. Atrophy of the breasts can occur with prolonged estrogen reduction, as with anorexia nervosa or menopause. Testicular atrophy can occur with prolonged use of enough exogenous sex steroids (either androgen or estrogen) to reduce gonadotropin secretion.

==Vaginal atrophy==

In post-menopausal women, the walls of the vagina become thinner (atrophic vaginitis). The mechanism for the age-related condition is not yet clear, though there are theories that the effect is caused by decreases in estrogen levels. This atrophy, occurring concurrently with breast atrophy, is consistent with the homeostatic (normal development) role of atrophy in general, as after menopause the body has no further functional biological need to maintain the reproductive system which it has permanently shut down.

==Research==
One drug in test seemed to prevent the type of muscle loss that occurs in immobile, bedridden patients.
Testing on mice showed that it blocked the activity of a protein present in the muscle that is involved in muscle atrophy. However, the drug&#x27;s long-term effect on the heart precludes its routine use in humans, and other drugs are being sought.

<text>Nikita Sergeyevich Mikhalkov (; born 21 October 1945) is a Soviet and Russian filmmaker, actor, and head of the Russian Cinematographers&#x27; Union. Mikhalkov is a three-time laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1993, 1995, 1999) and is a Full Cavalier of the Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot;.

Nikita Mikhalkov won the Golden Lion of the Venice Film Festival (1991) and was nominated for the Academy Award (1993) in the category Best International Feature Film for the film &quot;Close to Eden&quot;. He won an Academy Award (1995) for Best Foreign Language Film and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival (1994) for the film &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot;. Mikhalkov received the &quot;Special Lion&quot; of the Venice Film Festival (2007) for his contribution to the cinematography and nominated for an Academy Award for the film &quot;12&quot; (2007).

==Ancestry==

Mikhalkov was born in Moscow into the noble and distinguished Mikhalkov family. His great-grandfather was the imperial governor of Yaroslavl, whose mother was a princess of the House of Golitsyn. Nikita&#x27;s father, Sergey Mikhalkov, was best known as writer of children&#x27;s literature, although he also wrote lyrics to his country&#x27;s national anthem on three occasions spanning nearly 60 years – two sets of lyrics used for the Soviet national anthem, and the current lyrics of the Russian national anthem. Mikhalkov&#x27;s mother, poet Natalia Konchalovskaya, was the daughter of the avant-garde artist Pyotr Konchalovsky and granddaughter of another outstanding painter, Vasily Surikov. Nikita&#x27;s older brother is the filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky, primarily known for his collaboration with Andrei Tarkovsky and his own Hollywood action films, such as &quot;Runaway Train&quot; and &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;.

==Career==

===Early acting career===
Mikhalkov studied acting at the children&#x27;s studio of the Moscow Art Theatre and later at the Shchukin School of the Vakhtangov Theatre. While still a student, he appeared in Georgiy Daneliya&#x27;s film &quot;Walking the Streets of Moscow&quot; (1964) and his brother Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s film &quot;Home of the Gentry&quot; (1969). He was soon on his way to becoming a star of the Soviet stage and cinema.

===Directing===
While continuing to pursue his acting career, he entered VGIK, the state film school in Moscow, where he studied directing under filmmaker Mikhail Romm, teacher to his brother and Andrei Tarkovsky. He directed his first short film in 1968, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Home,&quot; and another for his graduation, &quot;A Quiet Day at the End of the War&quot; in 1970. Mikhalkov had appeared in more than 20 films, including his brother&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1972), before he co-wrote, directed and starred in his first feature, &quot;At Home Among Strangers&quot; in 1974, an Ostern set just after the 1920s civil war in Russia.

Mikhalkov established an international reputation with his second feature, &quot;A Slave of Love&quot; (1976). Set in 1917, it followed the efforts of a film crew to make a silent melodrama in a resort town while the Revolution rages around them. The film, based upon the last days of Vera Kholodnaya, was highly acclaimed upon its release in the U.S.

Mikhalkov&#x27;s next film, &quot;An Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano&quot; (1977) was adapted by Mikhalkov from Chekhov&#x27;s early play, &quot;Platonov,&quot; and won the first prize at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. In 1978, while starring in his brother&#x27;s epic film &quot;Siberiade&quot;, Mikhalkov made &quot;Five Evenings,&quot; a love story about a couple separated by World War II, who meet again after eighteen years. Mikhalkov&#x27;s next film, &quot;A Few Days from the Life of I. I. Oblomov&quot; (1980), with Oleg Tabakov in the title role, is based on Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s classic novel about a lazy young nobleman who refuses to leave his bed. &quot;Family Relations&quot; (1981) is a comedy about a provincial woman in Moscow dealing with the tangled relationships of her relatives. &quot;Without Witness&quot; (1983) tracks a long night&#x27;s conversation between a woman (Irina Kupchenko) and her ex-husband (Mikhail Ulyanov) when they are accidentally locked in a room. The film won the Prix FIPRESCI at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival.

In the early 1980s, Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, appearing in Eldar Ryazanov&#x27;s immensely popular &quot;Station for Two&quot; (1982) and &quot;A Cruel Romance&quot; (1984). At that period, he also played Henry Baskerville in the Soviet screen version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. He also starred in many of his own films, including &quot;At Home Among Strangers,&quot; &quot;A Slave of Love,&quot; and &quot;An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano&quot;.

===International success===

Incorporating several short stories by Chekhov, &quot;Dark Eyes&quot; (1987) stars Marcello Mastroianni as an old man who tells a story of a romance he had when he was younger, a woman he has never been able to forget. The film was highly praised, and Mastroianni received the Best Actor Prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination for his performance.

Mikhalkov&#x27;s next film, &quot;Urga&quot; (1992, a.k.a. &quot;Close to Eden&quot;), set in the little-known world of the Mongols, received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Mikhalkov&#x27;s &quot;Anna: 6–18&quot; (1993) documents his daughter Anna as she grows from childhood to maturity.

Mikhalkov&#x27;s most famous production to date, &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot; (1994), was steeped in the paranoid atmosphere of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror. The film received the Grand Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film, among many other honors. To date, &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot; remains the highest-grossing film to come out of the former Soviet Union.

In 1996, he was the head of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.

===Recent career===
Mikhalkov used the critical and financial triumph of &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot; to raise $25 million for his most epic venture to date, &quot;The Barber of Siberia&quot; (1998). The film, which was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, was designed as a patriotic extravaganza for domestic consumption. It featured Julia Ormond and Oleg Menshikov, who regularly appears in Mikhalkov&#x27;s films, in the leading roles. The director himself appeared as Tsar Alexander III of Russia.

The film received the Russian State Prize and spawned rumours about Mikhalkov&#x27;s presidential ambitions. The director, however, chose to administer the Russian cinema industry. Despite much opposition from rival directors, he was elected the President of the Russian Society of Cinematographers and has managed the Moscow Film Festival since 2000. He also set the Russian Academy Golden Eagle Award in opposition to the traditional Nika Award.

In 2005, Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, starring in three brand-new movies – &quot;The Councillor of State&quot;, a Fandorin mystery film which broke the Russian box-office records, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, a noir-drenched comedy about the Russian Mafia, and Krzysztof Zanussi&#x27;s &quot;Persona non grata&quot;.

In 2007, Mikhalkov directed and starred in &quot;12&quot;, a Russian adaptation of Sidney Lumet&#x27;s court drama &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. In September 2007, &quot;12&quot; received a special Golden Lion for the “consistent brilliance” of its work and was praised by many critics at the Venice Film Festival. In 2008, &quot;12&quot; was named as a nominee for Best Foreign Language Film for the 80th Academy Awards. Commenting on the nomination, Mikhalkov said, &quot;I am overjoyed that the movie has been noticed in the United States and, what&#x27;s more, was included in the shortlist of five nominees. This is a significant event for me.&quot;

He also served as the executive producer of an epic film &quot;1612&quot;.

Mikhalkov presented his &quot;epic drama&quot; &quot;Burnt by the Sun 2&quot; at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, but did not receive any awards. The film was selected in 2011 as the Russian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 84th Academy Awards.

==Personal life==
Mikhalkov&#x27;s first wife was renowned Russian actress Anastasiya Vertinskaya, whom he married on 6 March 1967. They had a son, Stepan (born September 1966).

With his second wife, former model Tatyana, he had a son Artyom (born 8 December 1975), and daughters Anna (born 1974) and Nadya (born 27 September 1986).

===Political activity===

Mikhalkov is actively involved in Russian politics. He is known for his at times Russian nationalist and Slavophile views. Mikhalkov was instrumental in propagating Ivan Ilyin&#x27;s ideas in post-Soviet Russia. He authored several articles about Ilyin and came up with the idea of transferring his remains from Switzerland to the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow, where the philosopher had dreamed to find his last retreat. The ceremony of reburial, also of Anton Denikin, a general whose slogan was ‘Russia, one and indivisible’ was held on 3 October 2005.

In October 2006, Mikhalkov visited Serbia, giving moral support to Serbia&#x27;s sovereignty over Kosovo. In 2008, he visited Serbia to support Tomislav Nikolić who was running as the ultra-nationalist candidate for the Serb presidency at the time. Mikhalkov took part in a meeting of &quot;Nomocanon&quot;, a Serb youth organization which denies war crimes committed by Serbs in the 1992–99 Yugoslav Wars. In a speech given to the organization, Mikhalkov spoke about a &quot;war against Orthodoxy&quot; wherein he cited Orthodox Christianity as &quot;the main force which opposes cultural and intellectual McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. In response to his statement, a journalist asked Mikhalkov: &quot;Which is better, McDonald&#x27;s or Stalinism?&quot; Mikhalkov answered: &quot;That depends on the person&quot;. Mikhalkov has described himself as a monarchist.

Mikhalkov has been a strong supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin. In October 2007, Mikhalkov, who produced a television program for Putin&#x27;s 55th birthday, co-signed an open letter asking Putin not to step down after the expiry of his term in office.

Mikhalkov&#x27;s vertical of power-style leadership of the Cinematographers&#x27; Union has been criticized by many prominent Russian filmmakers and critics as autocratic, and encouraged many members to leave and form a rival union in April 2010.

In 2015, Mikhalkov was banned from entering Ukraine for 5 years because of his support for the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Despite his support for the annexation of Crimea he also called for the release of imprisoned Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov.

On 24 February 2022, he advocated the international recognition of the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic by Russia and supported 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing betrayal by Ukraine and the killings of Donbas residents. He also criticized those Russian cultural figures who oppose Russia&#x27;s invasion, arguing that they were silent about the crimes against Donbas, and now, in his opinion, they are only saving their property abroad from sanctions and teaching their children there.

In December 2022 the EU sanctioned Mikhalkov in relation to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In January 2023, Ukraine imposed sanctions on Mikhalkov for his support of 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>A military funeral is a memorial or burial rite given by a country&#x27;s military for a soldier, sailor, marine or airman who died in battle, a veteran, or other prominent military figures or heads of state. A military funeral may feature guards of honor, the firing of volley shots as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a flag draping over the coffin.

==Canada==
Canadian military funerals involve many rituals seen in other parts of the world. The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery use a 25-pounder gun and limber as the funeral vehicle. Muffled drums accompany the graveside processional. The deceased&#x27;s headdress, insignia and medals are borne on a velvet cushion into the funeral service. Volleys are fired over the grave when the body is interred. Countries in the Commonwealth duplicate the British military drill and ceremony. The Canadian funeral described above typifies the funerary service. The bugle tunes &quot;Last Post&quot; and &quot;The Rouse&quot; are played as the body is interred.

Despite being a police force and not a branch of the military, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was given battle honours as if were a dragoon regiment by King George V in 1921 in recognition of its members who served in the Boer and Great Wars. The RCMP therefore performs military-style &quot;regimental funerals&quot; for members and officers killed in the line of duty and retired members and officers with exceptional records of service.

An RCMP regimental funeral will typically include a procession, a church service or public service, and either an interment or graveside ceremony for burials or chapel ceremony for cremations. The procession includes a charger (a riderless horse), a bearer party commander, eight casket bearers, an insignia bearer if there are insignia to be borne, two headdress bearer, honorary pallbearers, a gun carriage or hearse. Dress is &quot;review order&quot; (Red Serge and Stetson). The RCMP&#x27;s guidon may be present and if so is draped on a military drum for the procession. The casket may be draped with the national flag of Canada, the Union Jack, or the RCMP ensign. Other police forces in Canada also refer to funerals for their officers in this way, as &quot;regimental funerals&quot;, despite not, in fact, being military regiments even ceremonially.

==Chile==

In Chilean military funerals, the German song &quot;Ich hatt&#x27; einen Kameraden&quot; is sung in its Spanish version (&quot;Yo tenía un camarada&quot;). The casket may or may not be horse-drawn on a caisson. A bugler sounds the final honors during interment.

When the coffin enters the tomb, a fireteam executes a salvo. If for a general or flag officer, the 1st Artillery Regiment &quot;Tacna&quot; fires a three-volley gun salute.

==Germany==
In Germany, the coffin is covered by a &quot;Bundesdienstflage&quot; (Federal service flag) the eagle facing to the right, looking to the head of the deceased.
At the level of the head of the deceased, a headdress (helmet, cap, mountain cap, beret), opening downwards, shield/edge pointing to the head of the coat of arms eagle is attached to the coffin.
Since, according to German ceremonial, the coffin is lowered into the grave enveloped in the flag, a second flag is carried separately for the purpose of handing it over to the family. 
Ludwig Uhland&#x27;s song &quot;Ich hatt&#x27; einen Kameraden&quot; is an integral part of a military funeral. It is played when the coffin is lowered into the grave,
military personnel will perform a salute.

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, military funerals are generally given only either towards retired personnel of the Indonesian National Armed Forces who served in domestic operations or in international peacekeeping operations or retired guerrillas and/or soldiers of the Indonesian National Revolution, especially those holding the &quot;Bintang Gerilya (Star of the Guerrilla)&quot; order, or to active personnel killed while on active duty service. Exceptional politicians and Ministers have the option for such a funeral, but most opt for a more intimate religious one. During the occasion of a state funeral, it is obligatory for a military funeral to be conducted, preceded by a final religious service before the funeral march begins. A Three-volley salute is the norm done by a squad seven soldiers occasionally a mixture of Armed Forces or Police personnel dependent on their career. The Honour drill team surrounding the burial site is a platoon-size or company formation and the larger the platoon or company, the more illustrious the departed. Prayers are led by representatives of the person&#x27;s religious faith. Similar traditions also exist in the Indonesian National Police.

See here: Indonesian Military Funeral Video Sample

During the funeral ceremony, the presiding officer of the ceremony reads a message of remembrance in the name of the government and people of Indonesia, as well as his/her chosen uniformed organization in which he/she served, preceded by a reading of the person&#x27;s life and achievements, as well as of his/her military/police service record (if any). The text is as follows:


==Italy==

In Italy the members of the Armed Forces who died in the line of duty are granted a state funeral by decree of the prime minister. So the funeral follows the protocol of a state funeral, and in particular the six officers in high uniform who carry the coffin are members of the same Armed Force of the departed.

==Poland==
In Poland, the last fragment of Władysław Tarnowski&#x27;s song &quot;Śpij, kolego&quot; (&quot;Sleep, friend&quot;), a portion of the larger composition &quot;Jak to na wojence ładnie&quot; (the title has no precise English translation, but it is roughly &quot;how nice it is in war&quot;, with a diminutive form conveying a sense of ironic solidarity) is an integral part of a military funeral, played by a trumpeter. It is also played during state ceremonies. Also part of it is a three volley salute (&quot;salwa honorowa&quot;) with the firing party consisting of an armed platoon or company.

==Russia==

In Russia, the people eligible for the military funerals are the distinguished veterans honorably discharged from service, servicemen killed in action or otherwise perished during their active service, state dignitaries and some other categories of people who distinguished themselves in state service. The ritual includes the honor guard, size of which depends on the deceased rank and status and may vary from merely a squad to a full company, which escorts the departed to the hearse and from the hearse to the grave, with a special detachment to carry the deceased&#x27;s awards. A military marching band accompanies the funeral procession as well, traditionally playing the &quot;How glorious is our Lord&quot; (an old Royal anthem from XVIII century) as the body is put on the hearse and the National Anthem of Russia during the salute after the actual burial. On special occasions the garrison commander may authorise the use of a gun carriage (horse or motor drawn at his discretion) instead of a traditional motor hearse (a gun carriage in a Continental style is traditionally used in Russia instead of a caisson preferred in the Anglosphere). A deceased&#x27;s portrait is carried before the procession, followed by the funerary wreaths and the awards, with the pallbearers following them. All military personnel presented are required to stand at attention as a flag-wrapped casket passes them. Aside from a flag, a land or air forces veteran is buried with his or her regulation cap on the casket, while naval officers are also entitled to their ceremonial dirk and its sheath to be crossed on a casket cover. Russian Orthodox clergy say a memorial player for the deceased serviceman or woman. At the burial ground, the eulogy is first read, the flag is lowered and the band plays the funerary march as the casket is lowered into the grave, after which a three-volley salute is fired with blank rounds, followed by the performance of the national anthem by the band. An artillery gun salute may be authorised for a particularly important funeral for a general or flag officer.

==Spain==

In Spain, the formed troops sing &quot;La muerte no es el final&quot;: &quot;Death is not the End&quot; during funeral ceremonies and in all military ceremonies, when the fallen are being honored. The Spanish Legion has an exception: the regimental hymn &quot;Novio de la Muerte&quot; (&quot;Bridegroom of Death&quot;) is played in full instead during occasions that the Legion attends.

==United Kingdom==

The British Army carries reversed arms at military funerals. The Last Post and Rouse or Reveille are sounded at the appropriate moment during the rite.

==United States==

In the United States, the United States Army Military District of Washington (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. &quot;Honoring Those Who Served&quot; is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation&#x27;s veterans.

As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the United States Armed Forces shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an honor guard detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the flag of the United States to the next of kin and the playing of &quot;Taps&quot;, which will be played by a lone bugler, if available, or by audio recording. Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one. However, federal law allows Reserve and National Guard units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary. On the day of the burial or interment, the U.S. Flag is lowered to half-staff.

* Irish Republican Army members have been awarded military funerals.
* On occasion, deceased soldiers have been accorded military funerals by their enemies (for example, see Manfred von Richthofen).

<doc id="712326" wikidata="Q645363" url="?curid=712326" title="Bursitis">
<text>Bursitis is the inflammation of one or more bursae (synovial sacs) of synovial fluid in the body. They are lined with a synovial membrane that secretes a lubricating synovial fluid. There are more than 150 bursae in the human body. The bursae rest at the points where internal functionaries, such as muscles and tendons, slide across bone. Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying on the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem. Muscle can also be stiffened.

==Signs and symptoms==

Bursitis commonly affects superficial bursae. These include the subacromial, prepatellar, retrocalcaneal, and &quot;pes anserinus&quot; bursae of the shoulder, knee, heel and shin, etc. (see below). Symptoms vary from localized warmth and erythema (redness) to joint pain and stiffness, to stinging pain that surrounds the joint around the inflamed bursa.

Bursitis could possibly also cause a snapping, grinding or popping sound – known as snapping scapula syndrome – when it occurs in the shoulder joint. This is not necessarily painful.

==Cause==
There can be several concurrent causes. Trauma, auto-immune disorders, infection and iatrogenic (medicine-related) factors can all cause bursitis. Bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive movement and excessive pressure. Shoulders, elbows and knees are the most commonly affected. Inflammation of the bursae may also be caused by other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and gout. Immune deficiencies, including HIV and diabetes, can also cause bursitis.

Traumatic injury is another cause of bursitis. The inflammation irritates because the bursa no longer fits in the original small area between the bone and the functionary muscle or tendon. When the bone increases pressure upon the bursa, bursitis results. Sometimes the cause is unknown. It can also be associated with various other chronic systemic diseases.

==Diagnosis==
History of injury &amp; Physical examination.
U/S or MRI

==Treatment==
It is important to differentiate between infected and non-infected bursitis. People may have surrounding cellulitis and systemic symptoms include a fever. The bursa should be aspirated to rule out an infectious process.

Bursae that are not infected can be treated symptomatically with rest, ice, elevation, physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory drugs and pain medication. Since bursitis is caused by increased friction from the adjacent structures, a compression bandage is not suggested because compression would create more friction around the joint. Chronic bursitis can be amenable to bursectomy and aspiration. Bursae that are infected require further investigation and antibiotic therapy. Steroid therapy may also be considered.

<doc id="712333" wikidata="Q959922" url="?curid=712333" title="Carbuncle">
<text>A carbuncle is a cluster of boils caused by bacterial infection, most commonly with &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. The presence of a carbuncle is a sign that the immune system is active and fighting the infection. The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body, or other people; those living in the same residence may develop carbuncles at the same time. In the early 21st century, infection involving methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) has become more common.

==Signs and symptoms==
A carbuncle is a cluster of several boils, which is typically filled with purulent exudate (dead neutrophils, phagocytized bacteria, and other cellular components). Fluid may drain freely from the carbuncle, or intervention involving an incision and drainage procedure may be needed. Carbuncles may develop anywhere, but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck.

A carbuncle is palpable and can range in size from as small as a pea to as large as a golf ball. The surrounding area is indurated. Later, skin on the centre of the carbuncle softens and peripheral satellite vesicles appear; these rupture, discharging pus, and give rise to appearance. As the impending infection develops, itching may occur. There may be localized erythema or skin irritation, and the area may be painful when touched. Sometimes more severe symptoms may occur, such as fatigue, fever, chills, and general malaise as the body fights the infection.

==Cause==
Infections by bacteria, commonly strep and staph.
==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The word is believed to have originated from the Latin: &quot;carbunculus&quot;, originally a small coal; diminutive of &quot;carbon-&quot;, &quot;carbo&quot;: charcoal or ember, but also a carbuncle stone, &quot;precious stones of a red or fiery colour&quot;, usually garnets.

===Metaphor: the &quot;monstrous carbuncle&quot;===
In 1984, Charles III, then Prince of Wales, described the proposed Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London as a &quot;monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend&quot;, a term he has used since to describe other pieces of architecture.

<doc id="712345" wikidata="Q1270448" url="?curid=712345" title="Debridement">
<text>Debridement is the medical removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. Removal may be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (self-digestion), or by maggot therapy.

In podiatry, practitioners such as chiropodists, podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove conditions such as calluses and verrucas.

Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites.

Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For example, when excising a tumor, there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected, but if not removed, could cause a relapse. In such circumstances, a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumor is completely removed.

== Types ==
There is a lack of high-quality evidence to compare the effectiveness of various debridement methods on time taken for debridement or time taken for complete healing of wounds.

=== Surgical debridement ===
Surgical or &quot;sharp&quot; debridement and laser debridement under anesthesia are the fastest methods of debridement. They are very selective, meaning that the person performing the debridement has nearly complete control over which tissue is removed and which is left behind.
Surgical debridement can be performed in the operating room or bedside, depending on the extent of the necrotic material and a patient&#x27;s ability to tolerate the procedure.
The surgeon will typically debride tissue back to viability, as determined by tissue appearance and the presence of blood flow in healthy tissue.

=== Autolytic debridement ===
Autolysis uses the body&#x27;s own enzymes and moisture to re-hydrate, soften and finally liquefy hard eschar and slough. Autolytic debridement is selective; only necrotic tissue is liquefied. It is also virtually painless for the patient. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with the use of occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings which maintain wound fluid in contact with the necrotic tissue. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with hydrocolloids, hydrogels and transparent films. It is suitable for wounds where the amount of dead tissue is not extensive and where there is no infection.

=== Enzymatic debridement ===
Chemical enzymes are fast-acting products that slough off necrotic tissue. These enzymes are derived from micro-organisms including &quot;Clostridium histolyticum&quot;; or from plants, examples include collagenase, varidase, papain, and bromelain. Some of these enzymatic debriders are selective, while some are not. This method works well on wounds (especially burns) with a large amount of necrotic debris or with eschar formation. However, the results are mixed and the effectiveness is variable. Therefore, this type of debridement is used sparingly and is not considered a standard of care for burn treatments.

=== Mechanical debridement ===
When removal of tissue is necessary for the treatment of wounds, hydrotherapy which performs selective mechanical debridement can be used. Examples of this include directed wound irrigation and therapeutic irrigation with suction. Baths with whirlpool water flow should not be used to manage wounds because a whirlpool will not selectively target the tissue to be removed and can damage all tissue. Whirlpools also create an unwanted risk of bacterial infection, can damage fragile body tissue, and in the case of treating arms and legs, bring risk of complications from edema.

Hydrosurgery uses a high‐pressure, water‐based jet system to remove burnt skin. This should leave behind the unburned, healthy skin. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review aimed to find out if burns treated with hydrosurgery heal more quickly and with fewer infections than burns treated with a knife. The review authors only found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) with very low certainty evidence that investigated this. Based on this trial, they concluded that it is uncertain whether or not hydrosurgery is better than conventional surgery for early treatment of mid‐depth burns. More RCTs are needed to fully answer this question.

Allowing a dressing to proceed from moist to dry, then manually removing the dressing causes a form of non-selective debridement. This method works best on wounds with moderate amounts of necrotic debris (e.g. &quot;dead tissue&quot;).
=== Maggot therapy ===
In maggot therapy, a number of small maggots are introduced to a wound in order to consume necrotic tissue, and do so far more precisely than is possible in a normal surgical operation. Larvae of the green bottle fly (&quot;Lucilia sericata&quot;) are used, which primarily feed on the necrotic (dead) tissue of the living host without attacking living tissue. Maggots can debride a wound in one or two days. The maggots derive nutrients through a process known as &quot;extracorporeal digestion&quot; by secreting a broad spectrum of proteolytic enzymes that liquefy necrotic tissue, and absorb the semi-liquid result within a few days. In an optimum wound environment maggots molt twice, increasing in length from 1–2 mm to 8–10 mm, and in girth, within a period of 3–4 days by ingesting necrotic tissue, leaving a clean wound free of necrotic tissue when they are removed.

<doc id="712352" wikidata="Q2353181" url="?curid=712352" title="M-52 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-52 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus is on the Ohio border, where it continues as State Route 109 (SR 109). The highway passes through communities like Adrian, where it intersects US Highway 223 (US 223), Chelsea and Webberville along its course. It crosses some major rivers, including the River Raisin and the Shiawassee. The section of the highway between M-50 and Manchester was built as a limited-access highway. M-52&#x27;s northern terminus is at M-46, west of Saginaw.

Adrian previously converted their downtown streets to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings of the two state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US 223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.

M-52 is an original state trunkline highway, dating to the 1919 formation of the system. Other segments of the modern routing were designated M-92 and M-47 at the time. Extensions to M-52 supplanted M-92 completely and M-47 partially along their routings. These extensions completed the modern M-52 routing in the late 1960s.

==Route description==
M-52 starts at the Ohio state line as Adrian Highway in Fairfield Township, Lenawee County, where it is the continuation of SR 109 into Michigan. The highway runs north to Adrian where it intersects US Highway 223 (US 223) at the city border with Madison Township. As the highway crosses the city line, it is concurrently designated Business US 223 (Bus. US 223) along Main Street into downtown Adrian. Bus. US 223/M-52 intersects Beecher Street, which carries M-34 to the latter&#x27;s eastern terminus in Adrian. After Beecher, Main Street turns north-northeast into the downtown area.

In downtown Adrian, M-52 runs north along Main Street to Church Street. Since November 2009, the one-way streets were converted back to two-way functionality. Both directions of M-52 now turn east along Church, then north along Broad Street. At Front Street, traffic is diverted west back to Main Street. Continuing north out of downtown Adrian, M-52 follows Main Street over the South Branch of the River Raisin and out of the city limits, where it once again becomes Adrian Highway. The highway curves from running north-northeast back to due north. West of the city of Tecumseh, the trunkline intersects M-50. M-52 continues north as a limited-access highway. Access to and from the highway is limited to select cross roads only. Just south of the county line, the highway intersects with US 12 before crossing into Washtenaw County.
The limited-access section of M-52 continues north through western Washtenaw County, where it ends in Manchester. M-52 turns west along Austin and City roads into the village. The trunkline continues along the banks of the north branch of the River Raisin on Riverside Drive before turning north out of town. Just south of Chelsea, M-52 crosses Interstate 94 (I-94). The highway continues through downtown Chelsea and turns northwesterly through the Waterloo State Recreation Area in the northwesternmost part of the county. The highway clips the corner of Jackson County, running for almost through Waterloo Township before crossing into Ingham County south of Stockbridge.

M-52 joins M-106 south of Stockbridge, and the two highways run together into the village. In downtown, M-106 turns east and M-52 turns west before heading north out of town. At the Stockbridge–White Oak township line, M-52 joins M-36 which follows the townships&#x27; common border. The two highways run concurrently north into White Oak Township before M-36 turns west, ending the concurrency. In western Webberville, M-52 passes under I-96 and merges with M-43 at the latter&#x27;s eastern terminus. The two highways run north to, and turn west along, Grand River Avenue. At Perry Road, M-52 turns back north out of the village. The trunkline continues north into Shiawassee County and runs through Perry before crossing I-69. Continuing north, M-52 curves northeasterly into downtown Owosso intersecting M-21 west of M-71&#x27;s western terminus. M-52 continues northward parallel to the Shiawassee River into Saginaw County.
The trunkline runs through the community of Oakley before intersecting M-57 west of Chesaning. North of Chesaning, M-52 angles to the northeast into and through St. Charles, crossing the Shiawassee River west of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge. The northern terminus of M-52 is an intersection with M-46 west of Saginaw in Thomas Township.

==History==

M-52 was first designated by July 1, 1919. The original routing started at the Ohio state line and ran north through Adrian to M-50 much as it does today. It turned east along M-50 into Tecumseh and then turned north to Clinton where it terminated. The remainder of the modern highway routing is either not part of the state trunkline system, or it is parts of other highways at this time, M-92 or M-47. In 1954, M-92 was extended southward to end in Clinton at the same intersection with US 112 where M-52 terminated. By July 1, 1960, M-92&#x27;s southern end was shifted westward, terminating west of Clinton at US 112 on a new roadway south of Manchester. M-52 was extended around 1962 north between M-50 and US 12 (the former US 112) west of Tecumseh and Clinton. This extension ended at M-92&#x27;s terminus with US 12. M-52 was then extended north supplanting the M-92 designation in its entirety. M-52 at this time runs north from the Ohio state line to Millville in southwestern Ingham County. In the late 1960s, Stockbridge Road between Webberville and Stockbridge was upgraded to state highway standards and uploaded from the county to the state. This construction was shown on the 1969 state map. When it was completed later that year, M-52 was extended northward a second time, to I-96 outside of Webberville. Where Stockbridge Road crossed I-96, M-52 was continued north, supplanting M-47 through Webberville and north to the junction with M-46 west of Saginaw. This designation change shortened M-47 to its current southern terminus in Saginaw Township.
In downtown Adrian, the highways previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement was similar to a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US 223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing to the east of the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US 223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US 223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US 223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.

<text>Tennis was one of the 28 sports that was held at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The competition which was held from 19-28 September at the NSW Tennis Centre, saw four gold medals being contested with them being in the singles and doubles of both sexes.

The format at the 2000 Olympics was a single-elimination tournament with the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles being 64 players. They competed in six rounds of competition in the singles and five rounds in the doubles (sizes of 32). The format consisted of three set matches with five set matches being only played in the men&#x27;s singles and doubles final. 

The United States finished on top of the medal table with two gold medals as Venus Williams won both the women&#x27;s singles and doubles with Serena Williams. In the men&#x27;s events, Yevgeny Kafelnikov from Russia secured the men&#x27;s singles title while Canadian pair, Sébastien Lareau and Daniel Nestor took the men&#x27;s doubles.

<doc id="712365" wikidata="Q7390275" url="?curid=712365" title="SIBOR">
<text>SIBOR stands for Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend &quot;unsecured&quot; funds to other banks in the Singapore wholesale money market (or interbank market). It is similar to the widely used LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), and Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate). Using SIBOR is more common in the Asian region and set by the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS).

SIBOR comes in 1-, 3-, 6-, or 12-month tenure. At the end of the tenure, the borrowing bank returns the borrowed fund to the lending bank. The 3-month SIBOR is the most popular rate that loans are pegged to and has been hovering below around 1% in the past few years.

Many floating rate mortgages in the country are pegged to SIBOR due to its transparency. Alternatives to SIBOR include SOR, Fixed-rate mortgages, Combos (Combination of SIBOR and SOR). Although they may be higher or lower than SIBOR at any point of time, they usually move in tandem with the direction of SIBOR and are used by banks to help price loans.

SIBOR is being discontinued, with the 6-month SIBOR rate being discontinued with effect from 31 March 2022, and the rest of SIBOR to be discontinued with effect from 31 December 2024. SIBOR will be functionally replaced by SORA (Singapore Overnight Rate Average).

<doc id="712369" wikidata="Q316013" url="?curid=712369" title="Satoru Iwata">
<text>was a Japanese businessman, video game programmer, video game designer, and producer. He was the fourth president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Nintendo from 2002 until his death in 2015. Iwata was a major contributor in broadening the appeal of video games by focusing on novel and entertaining games rather than top-of-the-line hardware.

Born in Sapporo, Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school. He majored in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 1980, he joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while attending the university. At HAL, he worked as a programmer and closely collaborated with Nintendo, producing his first commercial game in 1983. Games to which he contributed include &quot;EarthBound&quot; and many games in the &quot;Kirby&quot; series. Following a downturn and near-bankruptcy, Iwata became the president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability. In the following years, he worked in the development of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division in 2000.

Nintendo saw growth under Iwata and, when Yamauchi retired, he became the company&#x27;s president in May 2002. Under Iwata&#x27;s direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS and Wii game consoles, helping the company achieve financial success. As a self-declared gamer, he focused on expanding the appeal of video games across demographics through a &quot;blue ocean&quot; business strategy. Nintendo attained record profits by 2009, and &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; placed Iwata among the top 30 CEOs worldwide. Iwata expanded his strategy by defining a quality-of-life product line for the Wii that evolved into a ten-year strategy to create standalone products. Later hardware such as the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii, and Nintendo&#x27;s net sales fell by two thirds from 2009 to 2012; the company saw its first operating losses in 30 years during this time. Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and again in 2014. In 2015, after several years of refusal, Iwata put a portion of Nintendo&#x27;s focus into the rapidly growing mobile game market; a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA was established that March. Throughout his career, Iwata built a relationship with Nintendo fans through social media and his regular appearances in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, becoming the public face of the company.

In June 2014, a tumor in Iwata&#x27;s bile duct was discovered during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The problem resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and gamers worldwide alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 D.I.C.E. Awards.

==Early life==
Satoru Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata displayed leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game, called &quot;Game 31&quot;, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April 1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as &quot;Volleyball&quot; and &quot;Missile Attack&quot;, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates.

He obtained his first computer, a Commodore PET, in 1978. He dismantled and studied the machine out of his desire to understand it. The computer coincidentally had a central processing unit (MOS 6502) similar to the one used by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a gaming console for which he would later develop games. Following high school, Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in April 1978, where he majored in computer science. Tomohiko Uematsu, an engineering professor, noted Iwata&#x27;s proficiency with software programming and remarked that Iwata could write programs faster and more accurately than any of his other students.

While attending the school, he was one of several unpaid interns at Commodore Japan, assisting the subsidiary&#x27;s head engineer—Yash Terakura—with technical and software-development tasks. One of his main reasons for taking the job was to spend more time around computers and learn of details not openly available to the public. Terakura would later serve as a mentor to Iwata, teaching him about hardware engineering to supplement Iwata&#x27;s already extensive software knowledge. Iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games. Classmates living in nearby apartments referred to Iwata&#x27;s room as He would frequently show off his games to the Seibu department store&#x27;s computer department, and by 1980 a group of employees there invited him to join their company, HAL Laboratory, Inc.

==HAL Laboratory==
While attending university, Iwata worked for HAL Laboratory as a part-time programmer in 1980. Among their first creations was a peripheral device that enabled older computers to display graphics for video games. With this device, Iwata and members of HAL created multiple games that were &quot;straight rip-offs of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Rally-X&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, and others&quot;. HAL became the first company to establish a license with Namco for developing games. He joined the company in a full-time capacity after graduating in 1982, becoming its fifth employee and only programmer. Around the same time, Iwata&#x27;s father was elected mayor of Muroran. Despite his passion, Iwata&#x27;s family did not approve of his career choice, and his father did not talk with him for six months after Iwata joined HAL.

Iwata became the company&#x27;s coordinator of software production in 1983, the time during which he helped HAL create a relationship with Nintendo so they would be able to produce games for its newly released Nintendo Entertainment System. He traveled to Kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for the NES, to which Nintendo obliged. His first commercially published game was &quot;Joust&quot; for the NES—a port of the 1982 arcade game. Other video games he worked on were &quot;Balloon Fight&quot;, &quot;NES Open Tournament Golf&quot;, &quot;EarthBound&quot;, and the &quot;Kirby&quot; games. Nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce &quot;Open Tournament Golf&quot;; however, all of them declined as they did not believe the large amount of data could be stored within an NES cartridge. Iwata seized this opportunity and &quot;recklessly&quot; stepped up to develop the game. It proved particularly taxing as Iwata had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all 18 courses into the game. Similarly, HAL had to program parallax scrolling for &quot;F-1 Race&quot; as the NES hardware did not initially support it.

Iwata&#x27;s proficiency with programming quickly placed him in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He would often continue to work on weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo&#x27;s then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¥1.5 billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself, often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others.

Although he was not part of Nintendo at the time, Iwata assisted in the development of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November 1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; for the Nintendo 64 by reading the original coding in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokémon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing &quot;Pokémon&quot; to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; for the Nintendo 64.

==Nintendo==

===Early years (2000–2002)===
In 2000, Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increases of 20 and 41 percent, values which are at least partially attributable to his work. When Yamauchi, the company&#x27;s president since 1949, retired on May 24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo&#x27;s fourth president with Yamauchi&#x27;s blessing. He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889. Yamauchi left the company in Iwata&#x27;s hands with a final request: &quot;that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres to that same standard.&quot; Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism, with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed. However, this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments.

At the time of Iwata&#x27;s promotion, Nintendo, though still a profitable company, was not performing as well as other console makers. The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors, with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox outselling it. His presidency also came at the onset of the popularization of online gaming, and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market. He took a cautious approach to the issue, stating: &quot;We&#x27;re not negative toward the idea of going online. We&#x27;re just practical.&quot; He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube&#x27;s appeal. During an interview in 2002, Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive, and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of the line graphics.

One of his first actions as president was to meet directly with the company&#x27;s 40 department heads and 150 other employees. This contrasted starkly with Yamauchi&#x27;s practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single, annual speech. Shigeru Miyamoto described the previous business atmosphere as &quot;stuffy&quot; and stated Iwata &quot;improved the ventilation&quot;. Iwata was acutely aware that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level. If employees disagreed with his view, Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own, stating &quot;creators only improve themselves by taking risks&quot;. Alongside the increased level of interaction, Iwata also brought more data and science into the business aspect of the company. Whereas Yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience, Iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position. Iwata also promoted Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, Yoshihiro Mori, and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company&#x27;s board of directors, equaling his own position.

===Revitalization of the company (2003–2009)===
Following up on his 2002interview, Iwata highlighted an urgency in the gaming market in his keynote speech at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show. During this speech, he reflected on the history of the industry and concluded with the declining interest in video games. A slump in sales in the Japanese market had begun at the end of the 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. Competition between Nintendo and Sony resulted in increasingly hardware-heavy consoles; however, the Nintendo 64 proved to be too cumbersome for developers and software suffered severely. After a year-long analysis conducted at Iwata&#x27;s behest, Nintendo concluded that pushing hardware was not the most effective way to promote video games and decided to focus on software. A major internal reorganization of Nintendo took place in 2004, with Iwata consolidating various departments established under Yamauchi. He sought to promote collaborative work throughout the company. He later established a &quot;User Expansion Project&quot; in 2005 whereby employees normally not associated with game development would submit ideas for new games.

In a March 2004 interview, Iwata stated: &quot;Games have come to a dead end.&quot; He stressed that developers wasted far too much time focusing on core gamers and would be unable to turn a profit if they did not tend to the average game player. Furthermore, he wished to prove that Nintendo, considered a &quot;conservative&quot; company at the time, would become a forefront innovator of entertainment. Iwata articulated a &quot;blue ocean&quot; strategy to help Nintendo successfully compete against the other console manufacturers. Instead of competing on technical specifications, Iwata drew on his previous experience as a game developer to produce novel and entertaining hardware and games.

====Nintendo DS====
Iwata helped lead a revitalization of Nintendo&#x27;s handheld business by transitioning the company from the Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS, which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games. The idea for using two screens on a single device originated with Yamauchi before his retirement, while Miyamoto suggested the use of a touchscreen. Miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of the device and its prototypes. The Nintendo DS proved to be a highly profitable system and went on to become the second-best selling video game console of all time with more than 154 million units, inclusive of subsequent iterations, sold by September 2014. In June 2004, Iwata sought a conference with Dr. Ryuta Kawashima about a game that could appeal to non-gamers. This project would later become &quot;Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!&quot;, released in May 2005. Iwata personally oversaw development of the &quot;Brain Age&quot; series, even foregoing a public appearance on the day of the Nintendo DS&#x27;s release in Japan on December 2. Miyamoto supported Iwata&#x27;s work with the series and sent one of his protégés, Kouichi Kawamoto, to help develop the game. The &quot;Brain Age&quot; series is partially credited with launching the popularity of the Nintendo DS, and the series as a whole sold over 30 million copies by December 2008.

Subsequent iterations of the Nintendo DS, the DS Lite and DSi, also saw positive sales. The DS Lite improved upon the original DS, featuring brighter screens and a slimmer design in accordance with consumer demand. Released in March 2006 in Japan and three months later worldwide, the DS Lite ultimately sold nearly 94 million units. Statistics showed that households often shared a single DS, and Iwata sought to expand this from one per household to one per person. The console&#x27;s third iteration, the DSi, embodies this idea with the &quot;i&quot; representing a single person. Despite concerns that the video game market was already over saturated by the DS and DS Lite, Iwata was confident that the DSi would sell, especially in European markets. The DSi built upon the success of the DS Lite by similarly meeting consumer demand. In addition to being slimmed further, the DSi featured two cameras, SD card support, an audio reader, and the &quot;Nintendo DSi Shop&quot;. The relatively quick succession of the DS Lite and DSi broke the conventional pattern for release of game systems, each being released roughly 18 months apart instead of 5 years. Iwata saw the gradual price drop in the five-year cycle as a way of indirectly telling consumers to wait to purchase products and a punishment for those who bought it at launch. He sought to alleviate this issue with the quick releases.

====Wii====
Discussions between Iwata, Miyamoto, and Takeda about a new home console began in the first half of 2003. With encouragement from Yamauchi, Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii. Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project, &quot;telling [Takeda] to go off the tech roadmap&quot;. The overall premise was that &quot;a Mom has to like it&quot;. During the console&#x27;s development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together, a feat they ultimately accomplished. Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with the GameCube. Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo&#x27;s engineers, Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone. Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda&#x27;s team provided the internal components. After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes, Takeda procured a CMOS sensor that later became the core aspect of the remote. With the addition of accelerometers, they were able to effectively produce motion controls.

Initially codenamed &quot;Revolution&quot; during a teaser at E3 2004, following Iwata&#x27;s goal of creating a gaming revolution, Iwata publicly revealed the Wii at E3 2005, holding it above his head to emphasize its small size and light weight design. Reveal of the Wii&#x27;s signature Wii Remote controller was withheld until the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005. During his speech at the conference, Iwata reiterated his stance on growing the gaming market but expanded upon it by emphasizing the need to make controls less complicated. The controller&#x27;s remote control design partially stemmed from Iwata&#x27;s desire to have a device that was &quot;immediately accessible&quot; to all. He also insisted that the Wii Remote be referred to as simply a &quot;remote&quot; rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to anyone.

The Wii ultimately popularized the use of motion control-based video games and proved highly successful for Nintendo, helping to nearly double the company&#x27;s stock price. Tapping into the market of casual players, the Wii marked &quot;a breakthrough moment in the history of video games&quot;: a new genre of gaming was established for the family market. Iwata&#x27;s former experience as a programmer, a rarity for technology CEOs, was said to help contribute towards his leadership of the company. By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, Nintendo saw record net sales and profit of ¥1.8 trillion (US$18.7 billion) and ¥279 billion (US$2.8 billion), respectively. Due to his success, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; included Iwata on their list of the 30 top CEOs worldwide from 2007 to 2009, stating that for Nintendo, &quot;Wii (was) a winner; stock soars&quot; under him.

====Quality-of-life products====
Starting with the introduction of the Wii in 2006, Iwata placed focus on development of products that improved quality of life. The &quot;Wii Fit&quot; series, conceptualized by Miyamoto, epitomized this movement. At E3 2009, Iwata revealed development of an add-on product to the Wii: the Wii Vitality Sensor. The device measured autonomic nerve functions, namely pulse, and incorporate acquired data into relaxation products. Iwata saw the device as a continuation of the &quot;blue ocean&quot; strategy previously articulated. He indicated that the market of motion controls was turning into a &quot;red ocean&quot;, whereby too many companies would saturate the market and restrict profits. The Vitality Sensor was developed in hopes of providing a novel way to interact with video games and continue Nintendo&#x27;s history of innovation. However, testing of a prototype device yielded less than desirable results and Nintendo had postponed the release of the product indefinitely by 2013.

In January 2014, Iwata unveiled a ten-year strategy for the company based on quality-of-life products. The target was a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October 2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, the sleep sensor was to be a stand-alone product that would not need to be worn. Following Iwata&#x27;s death in July 2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality-of-life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March 2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February 2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue. Nintendo-based products like the Nintendo Switch designed to encourage use on the go and social interactions, the mobile augmented reality game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; that requires travelling outside the house, and its addition &quot;Pokémon Sleep&quot; that works based on a player&#x27;s sleep patterns, all represent continuations of Iwata&#x27;s quality-of-life initiative. The Switch game &quot;Ring Fit Adventure&quot;, which includes accessories that let players manipulate the game through physical exercise, is seen as a successor to &quot;Wii Fit&quot; and continuing the quality-of-life program.

===Financial downturn (2010–2014)===
Subsequent hardware units under Iwata&#x27;s tenure, including the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, were not as successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo&#x27;s finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo&#x27;s engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon the release of the Nintendo 3DS caused the company&#x27;s stock to fall by 12 percent on July 29, 2011. The console&#x27;s poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he had misread the market and had not appropriately accounted for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.

The Wii U, released in November 2012, was sold below its production cost as Nintendo hoped for stronger software sales to alleviate ongoing losses. The addition of HD graphics, a feature not present in the original Wii, placed unexpected strain on development teams and led to software delays. Compounding the frustration of consumers was Iwata&#x27;s disinterest in competitors such as Microsoft and Sony, both of which experienced similar issues during the releases of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 respectively. Paul Tassi of &quot;Forbes&quot; claimed that Nintendo could have handled the change more efficiently by drawing lessons from Microsoft and Sony&#x27;s transition to HD graphics. The console ultimately failed to meet sales expectations and became the slowest-selling Nintendo platform, with 9.5 million units sold by June 2015. Miyamoto attributed the lackluster sales to public misunderstandings of the console&#x27;s concept and functionality. Iwata later admitted the console to be a failure as a successor to the Wii, with games being unable to showcase notable originality in the Wii U. The back-to-back failures of the 3DS and Wii U prompted Mitsushige Akino of Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. to suggest that Iwata should resign from his position.

Nintendo&#x27;s overall net sales declined from its peak of ¥1.8 trillion (US$18.7 billion) in 2009 to ¥549 billion (US$4.6 billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11 million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned a salary of ¥100 million (US$1.13 million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while other members of the Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20–30 percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo&#x27;s employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30 years earlier. Losses continued for the next two years before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015 fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as &quot;Pokémon Omega Ruby&quot; and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;.

In June 2013, Iwata took on the additional role of Nintendo of America&#x27;s CEO. As one of his first changes as CEO, Iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at E3, and instead have several smaller events, each aimed at a certain demographic. While traveling to Tokyo in late 2013, Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo&#x27;s games. This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later. Amiibo proved to be a huge success, with more than 6 million figurines sold by the end of 2014, roughly a month after launch. By March 2016, combined sales of figures and cards—a product released in 2015—exceeded 64 million units, proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms.

===Mobile market and Switch (2015)===

In early 2010, the success of Apple Inc.&#x27;s mobile App Store prompted concern among game developers that the medium was shifting to smart devices. That July, Iwata acknowledged competition from Apple and considered them the &quot;enemy of the future&quot;. However, during an interview the following year, Iwata appeared entirely against the idea of Nintendo moving into the mobile market, claiming the company would &quot;cease to be Nintendo&quot; if they did so. He reasoned that mobile gaming would lack integrity over the quality of games in an effort to turn a profit. A slow shift in this view ensued over the following years as the mobile gaming market continued to grow. In 2012 he acknowledged that mobile devices provided significant competition but remained confident in his company&#x27;s abilities. In a message to shareholders in March 2014 fiscal year, Iwata stated, &quot;... I believe that the era has ended when people play all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems.&quot; He cited the convenience of mobile devices for quick entertainment and expansive capabilities over a handheld console&#x27;s dedicated software. Criticism arose over his continued stubbornness in moving to the mobile market, with analysts and investors continually requesting a change in outlook. Yoshihisa Toyosaki, president of Architect Grand Design Inc., claimed that &quot;Nintendo is out of touch&quot;, referring to the company&#x27;s history of ignoring outside input. This ultimately negatively influenced Nintendo&#x27;s finances and popularity to a degree.

In March 2015, Iwata put part of Nintendo&#x27;s focus on the growing mobile game market, creating a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA to publish games, as traditional hardware console sales began to falter. This came in contrast to Nintendo&#x27;s previous business model which put focus on console exclusives to prompt people to buy their platforms. Iwata emphasized that although Nintendo IPs would be utilized in mobile games, the company would not compromise their integrity. He also stressed that the main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn the most money, similar to the idea behind the Wii. After the partnership with DeNA was established, Iwata reiterated his stance that the common free-to-play type mobile games, which he referred to as &quot;free-to-start&quot;, threatened the future quality of games. He also emphasized that the business model for these games did not match with the core values of Nintendo and could not serve as the basis of &quot;long-lasting relationship with [Nintendo&#x27;s] customers&quot;.

Iwata oversaw development of the Nintendo Switch through the final months of his life, serving as the console&#x27;s head developer. In a February 2017 interview with the magazine &quot;Time&quot;, Miyamoto believed Iwata&#x27;s goal for the system was to make it portable and allow communication between people. Iwata focused on the technical aspects of the device during this stage.

===Public relations===

During the earlier years of his presidency at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order to spend more time programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo&#x27;s public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo&#x27;s employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September 2006, stemmed from Iwata&#x27;s background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of the inner workings of the company.

In 2011, Iwata helped to institute Nintendo Direct, a series of online press conferences open to all that revealed upcoming Nintendo games and products outside of typical industry channels. These videos were often quirky and humorous, reflecting the personality of Iwata himself. This stood completely against the generally serious tones displayed by Sony and Microsoft. One such video displayed a mock battle between him and Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé to showcase the inclusion of Mii characters, Nintendo digital avatars, in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;. These frequently spurred the creation of Internet memes; such memes include the phrase &quot;please understand&quot; which was often used by Iwata for delays or other negative news, adding &quot;[Iwata laughs]&quot; to forum posts as a reference to his frequent laughter in segments of Iwata Asks, and images of Iwata staring silently at a bunch of bananas as part of a pre-recorded E3 2012 video to promote the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; franchise.

As a byproduct of his presence in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, Iwata became the public face of Nintendo. Iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them. Even when time did not allow, he would mingle with interviewers and chat casually.

===Other projects===
Iwata assisted in the founding of Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company which were established in 1995 and 1998, respectively, by Tsunekazu Ishihara. Iwata later coordinated licensing changes domestically and internationally with The Pokémon Company when it became its own entity. In 1998, Iwata helped his colleague and personal friend Shigesato Itoi establish Hobonichi by working as the company&#x27;s IT Manager. He acquired this position after being asked by Itoi one month prior to the June 6 launch date to arrange a website and the company&#x27;s technical systems, to which Iwata complied. Iwata personally enjoyed the role and even still held the position in 2007, despite running Nintendo full-time by this point. Soon after his promotion to president of Nintendo, Iwata assigned himself to a development team at HAL Laboratory working on &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, for the GameCube, to continue his programming passion. Stemming from his work with the &quot;Brain Age&quot; series, Iwata assisted in producing educational games such as &quot;Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten DS&quot;, &quot;English Training: Have Fun Improving Your Skills!&quot;, and &quot;Imasara Hito ni Kikenai Otona no Joushikiryoku Training DS&quot;. He also worked on &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series of games, among others. He also had a cameo in &quot;&quot;. Iwata partook in the development of &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, an augmented reality mobile game, starting in 2013. The game was publicly revealed in September 2015, two months after his death.

==Illness and death==
On June 5, 2014, Nintendo announced that Iwata would not attend E3 2014 due to medical problems. Iwata issued a public message to shareholders on June 24 that he had undergone surgery the previous week to remove a tumor in his bile duct discovered during a routine physical examination. After roughly four months of recovery from a successful surgery, he returned to work in October. During this time he lost a notable amount of weight, but stated he was feeling healthier as a result. Iwata made his first public appearance on a Nintendo Direct announcement on November 5, but looked &quot;gaunt and pale&quot;. He appeared to take this in stride and updated his own Mii, avatars used in Nintendo hardware, in June 2015 to reflect his slimmer self. On January 28, 2015, Iwata came down with a high fever and was suspected to have influenza; a meeting with shareholders was postponed accordingly. Some time after attending a different shareholder meeting on June 26, Iwata became ill again and was hospitalized. Despite his hospitalization, Iwata continued to work via his laptop in his bed and provided feedback on &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; to Tsunekazu Ishihara. He died due to complications from the tumor on July 11 at the age of 55 at . He was survived by his wife Kayoko (佳代子). Nintendo announced his death the following day.

Flags at Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters were lowered to half-staff on July 13. Nintendo&#x27;s regional offices took a day of silence on July 13 across all of its social media accounts in remembrance of Iwata. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their sadness on social media over Iwata&#x27;s death and gratitude for his accomplishments. Fans established memorials across the world, including at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, Russia, and the Nintendo World Store in Manhattan, New York. Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, stated: &quot;I pray that Mr. Iwata, who contributed so much to the development of the gaming industry, rests in peace.&quot; Composer and director Junichi Masuda, most known for his work with the &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, tweeted: &quot;He was a man who understood &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and a great leader. When I visited the other day, he was well. I will pray for his soul from the bottom of my heart.&quot; The Tokyo Institute of Technology issued a memorial statement on August 4, with Iwata&#x27;s former classmates and professors contributing their memories. At The Game Awards 2015, Reggie Fils-Aimé delivered a tribute to Iwata, describing him as &quot;fearless&quot; and &quot;unique, in the fullest meaning of the word&quot;.

Several hours after the announcement of Iwata&#x27;s death, a photograph of a rainbow over Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto was posted to Twitter and widely shared; it was dubbed &quot;the Rainbow Road to heaven&quot;, in reference to a stage in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series. Buddhist funeral services for Iwata were held in Kyoto on July 16 and 17. Despite stormy weather produced by Typhoon Nangka, an estimated 4,100 people attended to pay their respects. Among the attendees were Reggie Fils-Aimé, Shigeru Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, and Iwata&#x27;s close friend Masahiro Sakurai. Following the wake, Iwata&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes were buried at an undisclosed place in Kyoto.

Following Iwata&#x27;s death, general directors Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda temporarily managed the company together. On September 14, Nintendo announced that Tatsumi Kimishima, head of its Human Resources Division and former CEO of Nintendo of America, would succeed Iwata as the fifth president of Nintendo.

==Influence and legacy==
Throughout his life, Iwata was known for unconventional ideas and changing the medium of gaming. He was seen as the embodiment of Nintendo: playful, quirky, humorous, and fun. Iwata&#x27;s proficiency in programming led many to refer to him as a &quot;genius&quot; in the subject, with some likening him to a Japanese Bill Gates. His hands-on approach to business earned him admiration and respect from both developers and gamers. The opening to Iwata&#x27;s &quot;Heart of a Gamer&quot; speech at GDC 2005 is regarded as the &quot;essence&quot; of who he was: a humble businessman dedicated to video games. He, alongside others at Nintendo such as Miyamoto, are credited with vastly expanding the gaming market and creating a new genre. By targeting a new audience instead of competing against Microsoft and Sony, Iwata avoided a &quot;straight fight&quot; with Nintendo&#x27;s competitors and successfully achieved his goals. Accordingly, Iwata was referred to as a &quot;gentle revolutionary&quot;. The simplistic appeal of the Nintendo DS and Wii served to expand the market. Chris Kohler of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine stated that &quot;thanks to Nintendo&#x27;s Satoru Iwata, we&#x27;re all gamers now,&quot; referring to the surge in video game popularity following the releases of the Nintendo DS and Wii. Although widely respected, he received criticism over his stubbornness in moving Nintendo to the mobile market. Following Iwata&#x27;s death, Reggie Fils-Aimé remarked, &quot;... it will be years before his impact on both Nintendo and the full video game industry will be fully appreciated.&quot;

In October 2015, a fan-made Amiibo featuring Iwata&#x27;s Mii avatar was crafted and auctioned for US$1,900 on eBay; all proceeds were to be donated to the Child&#x27;s Play charity in his memory. Iwata was posthumously and unanimously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards for his influence across the gaming industry. Iwata was also posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 DICE Awards. At the 2016 Game Developers Choice Awards, Iwata was honored with a short animated film by David Hellman, the artist who worked on &quot;Braid&quot;. In July 2019, Hobonichi published a book, , by Yasuda Nagata in Japan. The book includes excerpts from many Iwata Asks interviews and interviews with Iwata&#x27;s closest friends, including Shigeru Miyamoto and Shigesato Itoi, after his death. In response to public demand, the agency is planning to localize the book in multiple languages with the Tuttle-Mori Agency. Viz Media published the title as &quot;Ask Iwata&quot; in North America on April 13, 2021.

===Video game tributes===
A tribute in honor of Iwata, reading &quot;This game is dedicated to our wingman who fell in battle&quot;, was placed at the end of the credits for &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;. Another speculated tribute appears in the Nintendo Switch 2017 launch game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot;, a game in development at the time of his death. A non-playable character, who bears a striking resemblance to Satoru Iwata, asks for the player to go atop Satori Mountain in search of the mystical Lord of the Mountain, who is also known by the name &quot;Satori&quot;. Given the similarity between &quot;Satori&quot; and &quot;Satoru&quot; and the fact that the Lord of the Mountain is seen as a guiding spirit, the quest is thought to be an elaborate tribute to Iwata. Both the non-playable character and the Lord of the Mountain return in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&quot;.

In September 2017, modders discovered that an emulated version of the NES game &quot;Golf&quot;, which Iwata programmed, is included in the Nintendo Switch firmware, accessed by moving the Joy-Con controllers similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in Nintendo Direct presentations when the system clock is set to July 11, the day of his death. This appeared to have been removed by Nintendo with a system update issued later that year. Within &quot;Pokémon Ultra Sun&quot; and &quot;Ultra Moon&quot;, visiting the Game Freak building with Pokémon introduced in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; has a non-player character relate how they were having trouble getting data onto the Game Boy Color game cards until they were helped by an &quot;amazing guy&quot;; this acknowledges Iwata&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; that allowed them to include the whole of the world from &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; without compromising the size of the &quot;Gold&quot;/&quot;Silver&quot; world.

<text>Ilha Tupinambarana is a former fluvial island bordered by rivers of the Amazon system (Amazon, Madeira, Sucunduri, and Abacaxis) in eastern Amazonas, Brazil. It has been split into four completely separate parts by natural channels, just like those isolating it from the mainland. The original island stretched from the municipalities of Parintins, in the northeast, to Nova Olinda do Norte, in the southwest. The combined area of the islands is to 11,850 km2, making Ilha Tupinambarana the second largest fluvial group of islands in the world after Bananal Island. The largest of the four parts is the 93rd largest island in the world and the 3rd largest island in Brazil.</text><links>

<text>Diathermy is electrically induced heat or the use of high-frequency electromagnetic currents as a form of physical therapy and in surgical procedures. The earliest observations on the reactions of the human organism to high-frequency electromagnetic currents were made by Jacques Arsene d&#x27;Arsonval. The field was pioneered in 1907 by German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt, who coined the term &quot;diathermy&quot; from the Greek words διά &quot;dia&quot; and θέρμη &quot;thermē&quot;, literally meaning &quot;heating through&quot; (adjs., diathermal, diathermic).

Diathermy is commonly used for muscle relaxation, and to induce deep heating in tissue for therapeutic purposes in medicine. It is used in physical therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body.

Diathermy is produced by two techniques: short-wave radio frequencies in the range 1–100 MHz (&quot;shortwave diathermy&quot;) or microwaves typically in the 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz bands (&quot;microwave diathermy&quot;), the methods differing mainly in their penetration capability. It exerts physical effects and elicits a spectrum of physiological responses.

The same techniques are also used to create higher tissue temperatures to destroy neoplasms (cancer and tumors), warts, and infected tissues; this is called hyperthermia treatment. In surgery diathermy is used to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye.

==History==
The idea that high-frequency electromagnetic currents could have therapeutic effects was explored independently around the same time (1890–1891) by French physician and biophysicist Jacques Arsene d&#x27;Arsonval and Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla. d&#x27;Arsonval had been studying medical applications for electricity in the 1880s and performed the first systematic studies in 1890 of the effect of alternating current on the body, and discovered that frequencies above 10 kHz did not cause the physiological reaction of electric shock, but warming. He also developed the three methods that have been used to apply high-frequency current to the body: contact electrodes, capacitive plates, and inductive coils. Nikola Tesla first noted around 1891 the ability of high-frequency currents to produce heat in the body and suggested its use in medicine.

By 1900 application of high-frequency current to the body was used experimentally to treat a wide variety of medical conditions in the new medical field of &quot;electrotherapy&quot;. In 1899 Austrian chemist von Zaynek determined the rate of heat production in tissue as a function of frequency and current density, and first proposed using high-frequency currents for deep heating therapy. In 1908 German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt coined the term &quot;diathermy&quot;, and performed the first extensive experiments on patients. Nagelschmidt is considered the founder of the field. He wrote the first textbook on diathermy in 1913, which revolutionized the field.

Until the 1920s noisy spark-discharge Tesla coil and Oudin coil machines were used. These were limited to frequencies of 0.1–2 MHz, called &quot;longwave&quot; diathermy. The current was applied directly to the body with contact electrodes, which could cause skin burns. In the 1920s the development of vacuum tube machines allowed frequencies to be increased to 10–300 MHz, called &quot;shortwave&quot; diathermy. The energy was applied to the body with inductive coils of wire or capacitive plates insulated from the body, which reduced the risk of burns. By the 1940s microwaves were being used experimentally.

==Uses==
===Physical medicine and rehabilitation===
The two forms of diathermy employed in physical medicine and rehabilitation are short wave and microwave. The application of moderate heat by diathermy increases blood flow and speeds up metabolism and the rate of ion diffusion across cellular membranes. The fibrous tissues in tendons, joint capsules, and scars are more easily stretched when subjected to heat, thus facilitating the relief of stiffness of joints and promoting relaxation of the muscles and decrease of muscle spasms.

====Short wave====

Shortwave diathermy machines initially used two condenser plates positioned on either side of the body part being treated. Another mode of application was through induction coils that were flexible and could be shaped to fit the body part to be treated (Nikola Tesla coils). As the high-frequency waves travel through the body&#x27;s tissues between the capacitors or coils, the energy is also converted into heat. The degree of heat and depth of penetration depend in part on the absorption of power as well as the electrical impedance of the current path between the electrodes, measured in ohms whose symbol is the Greek letter omega (Ω).

Shortwave diathermy operations use ISM band frequencies of 4.00, 8.00, 13.56, 27.12, and 40.68 MHz. Most professional electromedical devices deliver frequencies of 4.00, 8 .00 and 27.12 MHz.

SWD (shortwave diathermy) differs substantially from medium frequency diathermy which uses much lower frequencies (between 0.5 MHz and 1.00 MHz); the latter encountering particular resistance to penetrate deep tissues to the point of forcing the use of conductive creams or gels during sessions as known in treatments with Tecar therapy, for example. In summary, the energy induced with medium frequencies passes through the cellular interstices, with high frequencies it totally irradiates the cell. This notable difference can be seen in electrosurgical units.

As highlighted by various studies, in summary, short waves, thanks to their thermal and non-thermal effects, are able to strengthen the microcirculation of the anatomical area treated (angiogenesis), therefore inducing an anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory, muscle-relaxing, pain-relieving and proregenerative. In particular, 8 MHz (eight million Hertz) is used to soothe colon, rectal and lung cancer. Published studies have demonstrated not only their effectiveness, but also the increase in life expectancy of treated patients

The devices that have proven to be effective use filters, suitable for the purpose, to be able to deliver a wave with a practically perfect sinusoidal curve or in any case to drastically reduce any harmonics, with an impedance range, calculated on the Interposed, therefore on known impedance values, in reference to the frequencies involved and the materials used. All this means that the energy irradiates the treated part in an open cone, going well beyond the belly of the muscle.

High frequencies (8 MHz in particular) represent a very efficient means with which to transport the energy of the electromagnetic impulse directly to the anatomical site of interest: as the frequency increases, the resistance offered by the tissues is reduced, the impulse is therefore to go beyond the cell membrane and reach the deep tissues without significant energy dissipation. The impulse is distributed according to the architecture of the tissues, preferring and concentrating in the pathways that have a higher liquid content.
From a technical point of view, the skin is not subject to a direct increase in temperature (there is no risk of scalds or burns) and the treatment can be focused quite precisely on the deep tissues of interest. In an easy way. For this reason, no conductive gels or creams are needed and the user, a healthcare professional, can focus (hold the handpiece still) in a static manner on the part to be treated, for example for rhizarthrosis or in a post-operative situation on top of TNT

Shortwave diathermy is usually prescribed to treat deep muscles and joints covered by a heavy mass of soft tissue, such as the hip. In some cases, short wave diathermy can be applied to localize deep inflammatory processes, such as in pelvic inflammatory disease, in the thoracic-pulmonary part, in osteodegenerative diseases, in post-prosthetic surgery. Shortwave diathermy can also be used for hyperthermia therapy and electrolysis therapy, as an adjuvant to radiation in cancer treatment, especially 8.00 MHz. Typically, hyperthermia would be added twice a week before radiation therapy, as shown in the photograph from a 2010 clinical trial at the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan in Patna, India.

====Microwave====

Microwave diathermy uses microwaves, radio waves which are higher in frequency and shorter in wavelength than the short waves above. Microwaves, which are also used in radar, have a frequency above 300 MHz and a wavelength less than one meter. Most, if not all, of the therapeutic effects of microwave therapy are related to the conversion of energy into heat and its distribution throughout the body tissues. This mode of diathermy is considered to be the easiest to use, but the microwaves have a relatively poor depth of penetration.

Microwaves cannot be used in high dosage on edematous tissue, over wet dressings, or near metallic implants in the body because of the danger of local burns. Microwaves and short waves cannot be used on or near persons with implanted electronic cardiac pacemakers.

Hyperthermia induced by microwave diathermy raises the temperature of deep tissues from 41 °C to 45 °C using electromagnetic power. The biological mechanism that regulates the relationship between the thermal dose and the healing process of soft tissues with low or high water content or with low or high blood perfusion is still under study. Microwave diathermy treatment at 434 and 915 MHz can be effective in the short-term management of musculo-skeletal injuries.

Hyperthermia is safe if the temperature is kept under 45 °C or 113 °F. The absolute temperature is, however, not sufficient to predict the damage that it may produce.

Microwave diathermy-induced hyperthermia produced short-term pain relief in established supraspinatus tendinopathy.

The physical characteristics of most of the devices used clinically to heat tissues have been proved to be inefficient to reach the necessary therapeutic heating patterns in the range of depth of the damage tissue. The preliminary studies performed with new microwave devices working at 434 MHz have demonstrated encouraging results. Nevertheless, adequately designed prospective-controlled clinical studies need to be completed to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of hyperthermia with large number of patients, longer-term follow-up and mixed populations.

Microwave diathermy is used in the management of superficial tumours with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Hyperthermia has been used in oncology for more than 35 years, in addition to radiotherapy, in the management of different tumours. In 1994, hyperthermia was introduced in several countries of the European Union as a modality for use in physical medicine and sports traumatology. Its use has been successfully extended to physical medicine and sports traumatology in Central and Southern Europe.

===Surgery===

&quot;Surgical diathermy&quot; is usually better known as &quot;electrosurgery&quot;. (It is also referred to occasionally as &quot;electrocautery&quot;, but see disambiguation below.) Electrosurgery and surgical diathermy involve the use of high-frequency A.C. electric current in surgery as either a cutting modality, or else to cauterize small blood vessels to stop bleeding. This technique induces localized tissue burning and damage, the zone of which is controlled by the frequency and power of the device.

Some sources insist that electrosurgery be applied to surgery accomplished by high-frequency alternating current (AC) cutting, and that &quot;electrocautery&quot; be used only for the practice of cauterization with heated nichrome wires powered by direct current (DC), as in the handheld battery-operated portable cautery tools.

====Types====
Diathermy used in surgery is of typically two types. 
*Monopolar, where electric current passes from one electrode near the tissue to be treated to other fixed electrode (indifferent electrode) elsewhere in the body. Usually this type of electrode is placed in contact with buttocks or around the leg. 
*Bipolar, where both electrodes are mounted on same pen-like device and electric current passes only through the tissue being treated. Advantage of bipolar electrosurgery is that it prevents the flow of current through other tissues of the body and focuses only on the tissue in contact. This is useful in microsurgery and in patients with a cardiac pacemaker.

==Risks==

Burns from electrocautery generally arise from a faulty grounding pad or from an outbreak of a fire. Monopolar electrocautery works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument&#x27;s small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient&#x27;s body to a conductive pad that is connected to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad&#x27;s surface area is large relative to the instrument&#x27;s tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad&#x27;s electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.

As with all forms of heat applications, care must be taken to avoid burns during diathermy treatments, especially in patients with decreased sensitivity to heat and cold. With electrocautery there have been reported cases of flash fires in the operating theatre related to heat generation meeting chemical flash points, especially in the presence of increased oxygen concentrations associated with anaesthetic.

Concerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of surgical smoke produced by electrocautery. This has been shown to contain chemicals which may cause harm to patients, surgeons and operating theatre staff.

For patients that have a surgically implanted spinal cord stimulator (SCS) system, diathermy can cause tissue damage through energy that is transferred into the implanted SCS components resulting in severe injury or death.

==Military==
Medical diathermy devices were used to cause interference to German radio beams used for targeting nighttime bombing raids in World War II during the Battle of the Beams.

<text>In the visual arts, a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a painting, drawing, print or photograph, of the physical aspects of a city or urban area. It is the urban equivalent of a landscape. &quot;Townscape&quot; is roughly synonymous with &quot;cityscape,&quot; though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot;. In urban design the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space.

==History of cityscapes in art==
From the first century A.D. dates a fresco at the Baths of Trajan in Rome depicting a bird&#x27;s eye view of an ancient city. In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for portraits and biblical themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous copperplate prints and etchings were made showing cities in bird&#x27;s eye view. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.

In Ancient China, scroll paintings such as &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; (&quot;Qingming Shanghe Tu&quot;) offer a panoramic view of the cities depicted.

Halfway through the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the Netherlands. In his famous &quot;View of Delft&quot; in 1660–1661 Jan Vermeer painted a quite accurate portrait of the city Delft. Cities like Amsterdam, Haarlem and The Hague also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e., Great Britain, France, Germany) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in Venice (Canaletto, Guardi).

At the end of the 19th century the impressionists focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of everyday life in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and railway yards also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on abstract and conceptual art, and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter Edward Hopper, who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are Rackstraw Downes, Antonio López García, and Richard Estes. American artist Yvonne Jacquette has made a specialty of aerial cityscapes.

<text>Pyotr Kozmich Frolov (; – ) was a Russian mining engineer and inventor who built the first horse-railway in the Russian Empire in 1809. He elaborated on various canal projects and other artificial water constructions. Frolov also contributed to the development of scientific research and to the culture of the Altay region. His activities as a head of the Kolyvano-Voskresensk factories promoted a great advance of Russian technology in the beginning of the 20th century. He was appointed a senator in 1831.

<doc id="712387" wikidata="Q1371035" url="?curid=712387" title="Cephalaspidea">
<text>The order Cephalaspidea, also known as the headshield slugs and bubble snails, is a major taxon of sea slugs and bubble snails, marine gastropod mollusks within the larger clade Euopisthobranchia. Bubble shells is another common name for these families of marine gastropods, some of which have thin bubble-like shells. This clade contains more than 600 species.

Members of this worldwide clade used to be considered the most ancestral of the opisthobranchs, but now they are considered as derived and specialized members of the Euthyneura 

Headshield slugs are the most morphologically diverse group of all the opisthobranchs.

==Anatomy==
The vast majority possess a shell, although it may be reduced or internal. They have a well-developed headshield, a characteristic broadening at the head, which is used to plow beneath the surface of the sand. This headshield prevents the sand entering the mantle cavity. There is a muscular foot with or without parapodia (fleshy wing-like flaps).

===Life habits and related anatomical structures===
Headshield slugs often live just beneath the surface of the sand and can also be seen crawling on rocks. They have well-developed sensory structures to detect prey, which may be other opisthobranchs, polychaetes or bristleworms and foraminiferans. Several species are voracious carnivores.

Members of the brightly colored genus &quot;Chelidonura&quot; also have well-developed eyes on the anterior end of the head and bundles of sensory cilia around the mouth. With these cilia they are able to track their prey by following the victim&#x27;s mucous trail.

The Hancock&#x27;s organ is a chemosensory organ situated between the foot and the headshield. It plays a role in olfactory and sensory detection. It is visible as a dark brown pit at the base of the right rhinophore.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the shelled cephalaspideans, the bubble snails, like that of many shelled mollusks, used to be based very simply on shell characteristics. But because there are some similarities in shell morphology throughout this group, more recently taxonomists have taken other anatomical characteristics into consideration, such as the radula, gizzard, penis, and Hancock&#x27;s organ.

In 2015 a new study based on molecular phylogenetics has changed significantly the taxonomy of the Cephalaspidea. The monophyly of the Cephalaspidea was confirmed, but the families Cylichnidae, Diaphanidae, Haminoeidae, Philinidae, and Retusidae were found non-monophyletic. This had led to the creation of new families ((Alacuppidae, Colinatydidae, Colpodaspididae, Mnestiidae, Philinorbidae) ) and one new genus (&quot;Alacuppa&quot;). Two family names (Acteocinidae, Laonidae) and two genera (&quot;Laona&quot;, &quot;Philinorbis&quot;) are reinstated as valid

=== Linnaean taxonomy ===
* Suborder Cephalaspidea P. Fischer, 1883
** Superfamily Acteonoidea D&#x27;Orbigny, 1835
** Superfamily Bulloidea Lamarck, 1801
** Superfamily Cylindrobulloidea Thiele, 1931 – These are now included in the suborder Sacoglossa
** Superfamily Diaphanoidea Odhner, 1914
** Superfamily Haminoeoidea Pilsbry, 1895
** Superfamily Philinoidea J.E. Gray, 1850
** Superfamily Ringiculoidea Philippi, 1853

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
In the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005), the clade Cephalaspidea is arranged as follows:
* Superfamily Bulloidea: family Bullidae
* Superfamily Diaphanoidea: families Diaphanidae and Notodiaphanidae,
* Superfamily Haminoeoidea: families Haminoeidae, Bullactidae and Smaragdinellidae
* Superfamily Philinoidea: families Philinidae, Aglajidae, Cylichnidae, Gastropteridae, Philinoglossidae, Plusculidae and Retusidae
* Superfamily Runcinoidea: families Runcinidae and Ilbiidae

The superfamily Acteonoidea has been included into the new Informal Group &quot;Lower Heterobranchia&quot; and the superfamily Cylindrobulloidea becomes part of the Group Cylindrobullida.

=== 2009 taxonomy ===
Malaquias et al. (2009) have rearranged taxonomy of Cephalaspidea &quot;sensu lato&quot;:
* reinstated Architectibranchia
* reinstated Runcinacea as a valid name outside Cephalaspidea.
* reinstated Scaphandridae as a valid family.
* they did not use superfamilies in the classification scheme.

The taxonomy of Cephalaspidea &quot;sensu lato&quot; by Malaquias et al. (2009) is arranged as follows (there are listed genera under molecular analysis; not analyzed families are under &quot;incertae sedis&quot;):

Architectibranchia Haszprunar, 1985
* Family Acteonidae d&#x27;Orbigny, 1843 – &quot;Acteon&quot;, &quot;Mexacteon&quot;, &quot;Pupa&quot;
* Family Aplustridae Gray, 1847 – &quot;Hydatina&quot;, &quot;Micromelo&quot;
* Family Bullinidae Gray, 1850 incertae sedis
* Family Ringiculidae Philippi, 1853 incertae sedis
* Family Notodiaphanidae Thiele, 1931 incertae sedis

Runcinacea Burn, 1963
* Family Runcinidae H. Adams &amp; A. Adams, 1854 – &quot;Runcina&quot;
* Family Ilbiidae Burn, 1963 incertae sedis

Cephalaspidea Fischer, 1887 – This means Cephalaspidea &quot;sensu stricto&quot;
* Family Diaphanidae Odhner, 1914 – &quot;Diaphana&quot;, genus &quot;Colpodaspis&quot; is incertae sedis
* Family Cylichnidae H. Adams &amp; A. Adams, 1854 – &quot;Cylichna&quot;
* Family Scaphandridae G. O Sars, 1878 – &quot;Scaphander&quot;
* Family Retusidae Thiele, 1925 – &quot;Retusa&quot;, &quot;Pyrunculus&quot;
* Family Rhizoridae Dell, 1952 – &quot;Volvulella&quot;
* Family Bullidae Gray, 1827 – &quot;Bulla&quot;
* Family Philinidae Gray, 1850 – &quot;Philine&quot;
* Family Aglajidae Pilsbry, 1895–96 – &quot;Aglaja&quot;, &quot;Chelidonura&quot;, &quot;Navanax&quot;, &quot;Odontoglaja&quot;, &quot;Philinopsis&quot;
* Family Philinoglossidae Hertling, 1932 – &quot;Philinoglossa&quot;
* Family Gastropteridae Swainson, 1840 – &quot;Gastropteron&quot;, &quot;Sagaminopteron&quot;, &quot;Siphopteron&quot;
* Family Plusculidae Odhner, 1968 incertae sedis
* Family Haminoeidae Pilsbry, 1893 – &quot;Atys&quot;, &quot;Haminoea&quot;, &quot;Phanerophthalmus&quot;, &quot;Smaragdinella&quot;, &quot;Ventomnestia&quot; incertae sedis
* Family Bullactidae Thiele, 1826 incertae sedis

=== 2010 taxonomy ===
Subsequently, Malaquias (2010) moved &quot;Bullacta exarata&quot; (formerly the only member of Bullactidae) into the family Haminoeidae.

Jörger et al. (2010) moved Cephalaspidea &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and Runcinacea into the Euopisthobranchia and they confirmed the placement of Acteonoidea within the Lower Heterobranchia. All families of Architectibranchia were already within the Lower Heterobranchia in the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, except for the Notodiaphanidae, which has been placed in the Lower Heterobranchia since 2010, in order that the Architectibranchia can be considered to be monophyletic.

===2015 taxonomy===
The publication by Oskars T.R., Bouchet P. &amp; Malaquias M.A. (2015)&quot;. A new phylogeny of the Cephalaspidea (Gastropoda: Heterobranchia) based on expanded taxon sampling and gene markers.&quot; in the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 89 came to the following conclusion, with the creation of new families
* Acteocinidae Dall, 1913 – type genus: &quot;Acteocina&quot; Gray, 1847
* Alacuppidae Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015 – type genus: &quot;Alacuppa&quot; Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015
* Mnestiidae Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015 – type genus: &quot;Mnestia&quot; H. Adams and A. Adams, 1854
* Colpodaspididae Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015 – type genus: &quot;Colpodaspis&quot; M. Sars, 1870
* Colinatydidae Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015 – type genus: &quot;Colinatys&quot; Ortea, Moro and Espinosa, 2013
* Philinorbidae Oskars, Bouchet, and Malaquias, 2015 – type genus: &quot;Philinorbis&quot; Habe, 1950
* Laonidae Pruvot-Fol, 1954 (formerly Laoninae) – type genus: Laona A. Adams, 1865
* [unassigned] Cephalaspidea (temporary name) with the genera &quot;Cylichnium&quot; , &quot;Micratys&quot; and &quot;Noalda&quot; .

The superfamily Bulloidea was not supported in the Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis and Diaphanoidea was found polyphyletic. The superfamilies Haminoeoidea and Philinoidea were accepted. The composition of each of the superfamilies was drastically rearranged.

<text>Banana Republicans: How the Right Wing Is Turning America Into a One-Party State is a book by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber of the Center for Media and Democracy. It was published in 2004.

In the book, Rampton and Stauber argue that a right-wing political machine, in the form of the Republican Party and its functionaries in the media, lobbying establishment and electoral system, is undermining dissent and squelching pluralistic politics in the United States.

In writing &quot;Banana Republicans&quot;, Rampton and Stauber experimented with collaborative research, inviting Disinfopedia users to contribute their own research and analysis while the book was being written.
