<text>Icebreaker: Who Started the Second World War? (Russian title: &quot;Ледокол&quot;) is a military history book by the Russian non-fiction author Viktor Suvorov, published in 1989. Suvorov argued that Joseph Stalin planned a conquest of Europe for many years, and was preparing to launch a surprise attack on Nazi Germany at the end of summer of 1941 to begin that plan. He says that Operation Barbarossa was a pre-emptive strike by Adolf Hitler, a claim which the Nazi leader himself had made at the time. Since the 1990s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this theory has received some support among historians in some post-Soviet and Central European states, but some Western scholars have criticized his conclusions for lack of evidence and documentation.

==Content==
Suvorov first wrote about the theory in a short 1985 article. He expanded on it in his book &quot;Icebreaker&quot; and in subsequent books, ending with the 2007 monograph, &quot;The Chief Culprit: Stalin&#x27;s Grand Design to Start World War II.&quot; He says that in 1930s, Stalin was planning a conquest of Europe, had been working toward this objective for many years, and directed his military to plan for it.

Suvorov argues that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was engineered by Stalin to provoke Hitler to start a conflict with Western powers, which would have led to mutual exhaustion of &quot;capitalist powers&quot;. Then, Stalin planned to seize an opportune moment to attack Germany from the east, overrun Europe, and establish Soviet control. Suvorov considers Operation Barbarossa to have been a pre-emptive strike by Hitler, an act of self-defence in an attempt to prevent imminent Red Army assault.

He argued that Soviet ground forces were well-organized and mobilized &quot;en masse&quot; along the German–Soviet frontier for a Soviet invasion of Europe slated for Sunday, July 6, 1941, but they were unprepared to defend their own territory.

He claimed that maps and phrasebooks issued to Soviet troops supported that theory. Military topographic maps, unlike other military supplies, are strictly local and cannot be used elsewhere than in the intended operational area. Suvorov claims that Soviet units were issued with maps of Germany and German-occupied territory and phrasebooks including questions about SA offices, which were found only in German territory proper. In contrast, maps of Soviet territory were scarce. Notably, after the German attack, the officer responsible for maps, Lieutenant General MK Kudryavtsev, was not punished by Stalin, who was known for extreme punishments after failures to obey his orders. According to Suvorov, that demonstrates that Kudryavtsev was obeying the orders of Stalin, who simply did not expect a German attack.

Suvorov offers as another piece of evidence the extensive effort Stalin took to conceal general mobilization by manipulating the laws setting the conscription age. That allowed Stalin to provide the expansive buildup of the Red Army. Since there was no universal military draft in the Soviet Union until 1939, by enacting the universal military draft on 1 September 1939 (the date that World War II had begun) and by changing the minimum age for joining the Red Army from 21 to 18, Stalin triggered a mechanism to achieve a dramatic increase in the military strength of the Red Army.

This specific law on mobilization allowed the Red Army to increase its army of 1,871,600 men in 1939 to 5,081,000 in the spring of 1941 under secrecy to avoid alarming the rest of the world. Also, 18,000,000 reservists were drafted for a duration of service of 2 years. Thus, according to supporters of that theory, the Red Army had to enter a war by 1 September 1941, or the drafted soldiers would have to be released from service.

=== Points ===
Suvorov&#x27;s main points include the following:

* The Soviet Union was intrinsically unstable. It had to expand to survive. According to Suvorov&#x27;s interpretation of the permanent revolution theory, the communist system had to expand and occupy the entire world to survive. Otherwise, the system would fail in a peaceful and/or military struggle with surrounding &quot;capitalist&quot; countries. Stalin and other Soviet leaders opposed that and high-ranking officials who supported &quot;permanent revolution&quot; were purged from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stalin publicly declared that &quot;the ultimate victory of socialism... can only be achieved on an international scale&quot;. Under that theory, Soviet leaders therefore started preparations for a large-scale war of aggression. They officially declared an adherence to the theory of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; according to which socialism can win in a single country, without being immediately overthrown by hostile capitalist neighbors. The leading country would then help revolutionary movements in other countries. Either way, the Soviet prewar doctrine was based on the Marxism-Leninism theory that capitalism will be overthrown through communist revolution.
* The Soviet Union made extensive preparations for a future war of aggression in the 1920s and the 1930s. Suvorov provides an extensive analysis of Stalin&#x27;s preparations for war. According to Suvorov, there were supposed to be three Five-Year Plan phases to prepare the Soviet Union for war. The first focused on collectivization, the second on industrialisation, and the third on the militarization of the country.
* Stalin escalated tensions in Europe by providing a combination of economic and military support to Weimar Germany and later to Nazi Germany (see Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941). After World War I, the Entente attempted to impose severe restrictions on Weimar Germany to prevent it from rearming and again becoming a significant military threat. During &quot;the early 1920s until 1933, the Soviet Union was engaged in secret collaboration with the German military to enable it to circumvent the provisions of the Versailles Treaty&quot;, which limited Germany&#x27;s military production. Moscow allowed the Germans to produce and test their weapons on Soviet territory, and some Red Army officers attended general-staff courses in Germany. The basis for that collaboration was the Treaty of Rapallo, signed between the two nations in 1922 and subsequent diplomatic interactions. The collaboration ended when the anticommunist Nazis took power in 1933. However, in 1932 and 1933, &quot;Stalin helped Hitler come to power by forbidding German Communists to make common cause with the Social Democrats against the Nazis in parliamentary elections&quot;. Suvorov claims that Stalin&#x27;s plan and vision was that Hitler&#x27;s predictability and his violent reactionary ideas made him a candidate for the role of &quot;icebreaker&quot; for the communist revolution. By starting wars with European countries, Hitler would validate the Soviet entry into World War II by attacking Nazi Germany and &quot;liberating&quot; and Sovietizing all of Europe. When he concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, Stalin &quot;clearly counted on the repetition of the 1914–1918 war of attrition, which would leave the &quot;capitalist&quot; countries so exhausted that the USSR could sweep into Europe virtually unopposed&quot; (see also Stalin&#x27;s speech on August 19, 1939).
* According to Suvorov and others, Stalin always planned to exploit military conflict between the capitalist countries to his advantage. He said as early as 1925, &quot;Struggles, conflicts and wars among our enemies are... our great ally... and the greatest supporter of our government and our revolution&quot; and &quot;If a war does break out, we will not sit with folded arms – we will have to take the field, but we will be &quot;last&quot; to do so. And we shall do so in order to throw the decisive load on the scale&quot;.
* World War II was initiated by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which became co-belligerents after signing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The essence of the pact was in the secret protocols, which divided Europe into spheres of influence and removed the Polish buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. Some countries that fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, Estonia and Latvia, were occupied. The difference between the smaller nations, occupied and annexed by the Soviets, and Poland, which was initially attacked by Germany, was that Poland had military assistance guarantees from the United Kingdom and France.
* Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany from the rear in July 1941, only a few weeks after the date on which the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union took place. According to Suvorov, the Red Army had already redeployed from a defensive to an offensive stance. Suvorov also states that Stalin had made no major defensive preparations.
* Hitler&#x27;s intelligence identified the Soviet preparations to attack Germany. Therefore, the Wehrmacht had drafted a pre-emptive war plan based on Hitler&#x27;s orders as early as mid-1940, soon after the Soviet annexations of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. On June 22, 1941, the Axis began an assault on the Soviet Union.

The book is based on an analysis of Soviet military investments, diplomatic maneuvers, Politburo speeches and other circumstantial evidences.

==Reception==
&quot;Icebreaker&quot; and subsequent books by Suvorov had sparkled what is currently known as &quot;Suvorov&#x27;s debates&quot;. Only a few authors now agree with Suvorov&#x27;s main thesis about prewar Soviet plans for Europe conquest (another extreme view, expressed by Carley, is that the Soviets had no aggressive plans at all). It is currently believed that whereas the war against &quot;capitalist powers&quot; was seen as potentially inevitable by Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was making some preparations for war, the Soviet pursuit for collective security system in Europe, or &quot;Litvinov&#x27;s line&quot;, was sincere in late 1930s, and the event that marked active Soviet war preparations was the rapid collapse of the Anglo-French alliance in 1940.

===&quot;Suvorov debates&quot;===

The Suvorov thesis about the preemptive strike by Hitler has been strongly criticised by many scholars, and the book was called &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; Most historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces. Many historians have written in response to Suvorov&#x27;s views; Gabriel Gorodetsky and David Glantz authored books debunking his claims. Suvorov received some support from Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov and Vladimir Nevezhin.

Glantz argues that the Soviet Union simply was not ready for the war in the summer of 1941 Robin Edmonds said that &quot;the Red Army planning staff would not have been doing its job if it had not devoted some time between 1939 and 1941 to the possibility, at some future date, of a pre-emptive strike against Wehrmacht&quot;. David Brandenberger said that recently-published pre-1941 German analysis of Soviet military readiness came to conclusion that Soviet preparations were assessed to be &quot;defensive&quot; by German intelligence.

===Public reception===
The book was enthusiastically accepted by a fraction of a German society that hoped to reintroduce Hitler as a legitimate part of the patriotic historical discourse. In post-Soviet Russia, whose collapse of communist ideology coincided with the wave of criticism of Stalin&#x27;s rule, the &quot;Icebreaker&quot; thesis about Stalin&#x27;s responsibility for World War II outbreak and about Soviet plans for world conquest found a considerable support in many of society who wanted to disassociate themselves with the uncomfortable past.

<doc id="698374" wikidata="Q794159" url="?curid=698374" title="Phone-in">
<text>In broadcasting, a phone-in or call-in is a programme format in which viewers or listeners are invited to air their live comments by telephone, usually in respect of a specific topic selected for discussion on the day of the broadcast. On radio (especially talk radio), it is common for an entire programme to be dedicated to a phone-in session. On television, phone-in&#x27;s are often part of a wider discussion programme: a current example in the UK is the &quot;Jeremy Vine&quot; TV show.

The concept dates to the early radio era: a December 1924 BBC 5NG Nottingham phone-in programme is described in a 1925 Radio Times article: &quot;listeners ... enjoyed the novelty of hearing their own voices taking part&quot;. A prior attempted phone-in to a BBC 2LO London programme &quot;led to such a rush on the telephones that the Post Office had to intervene&quot;.

Speech based Talk Radio UK was launched in 1995, with much of its programming featuring phone-ins. It also introduced the notion of the shock jock to the UK, with presenters like Caesar the Geezer and Tommy Boyd constructing heated discussions.

Ian Hutchby has researched power relations in phone ins, looking at arguments and confrontations. Using conversation analysis, he describes how the host retains power through devices such as &quot;The Second Position&quot; – the concept of going second in a discussion, giving the host time to formulate a response.

Similarly, the last word is always the broadcast word. The public can choose to end the conversation, but they are doing so by withdrawing from the interactional arena (Hutchby, 1996: 94-5; Talbot et al.).

In 2007, the BBC suspended all phone-in competitions (but not voting) due to an internal inquiry into corruption in the production of these games in shows such as charity telethons after a nationwide inquiry into the whole process leading to the cancellation of &quot;ITV Play&quot;.

In Ireland Liveline is a popular afternoon phone in show broadcast by RTÉ Radio 1 that is hosted by Joe Duffy. The phone in program usually focuses on consumer issues, current affairs and complaints from members of the public regarding various issues. The program and its presenter are frequently lampooned by numerous Irish comedians, one being David McSavage, who play on the popular perception that the program is merely an outlet for the angst of serial complainers and housewives while providing entertainment for those who revel in listening to despair and tales of misery delivered the callers. A quality of the show that is frequently satirized is Duffy&#x27;s seemingly exasperated expressions of despair upon hearing of the plight of a caller.

==Technology==
The caller is connected via a telephone hybrid, which connects the telephone line to the audio console through impedance matching, or more modernly through digital signal processing, which can improve the perceived audio quality of the call. Telephone calls are often organised through a system which also provides broadcast automation, with an administrative assistant answering calls and entering caller information on a personal computer, which also displays on the radio presenter&#x27;s screen. A profanity delay is often used to keep profanity and other inappropriate material off the air. For contests, the conversation can be recorded and edited &quot;on the fly&quot;, before playback on the air just a few minutes later.

<text>Black Diamond Equipment is a manufacturer of equipment for climbing, skiing, and mountain sports, based in Utah, United States. The company also has a global office in Innsbruck, Austria. The company is owned by Clarus Corporation, which also owns Pieps and ClimbOn! Skincare.

== History ==
Black Diamond Equipment&#x27;s history dates from the late 1950s, when climber Yvon Chouinard began hand-forging pitons and selling them from the trunk of his car in Yosemite Valley. Chouinard&#x27;s pitons quickly gained a reputation for quality, and Chouinard Equipment Ltd. was born soon after in Ventura, California.

In early 1989, after several product-liability lawsuits and a continued lack of profitability, Yvon Chouinard placed the company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Black Diamond was founded on December 1, 1989, when the assets of Chouinard Equipment Ltd. were purchased by a group of former company employees led by (now former CEO) Peter Metcalf, and a few outside investors. Metcalf moved the company and its 45 employees from Ventura, California to the Salt Lake City, Utah area in September 1991 to be closer to the climbing and skiing opportunities provided by the Wasatch Mountains.

In 1996, Black Diamond Equipment Europe was established in Reinach, Switzerland, making Black Diamond products more widely available throughout Europe. In 2006, Black Diamond Equipment Asia was established in Zhuhai, China to serve as both a secondary manufacturing facility, as well as a global distribution hub. In May 2010, Black Diamond Equipment was acquired for $90 million by Clarus Corporation. The resulting corporation was renamed and is now publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the name CLAR.

In 2015, Black Diamond announced they would be expanding their Utah manufacturing facility. In 2016, they announced they would be moving their European headquarters from Reinach to Innsbruck in Austria.

== Products ==
Black Diamond Equipment design and manufacture products for climbing, skiing, and mountain sports. Climbing products include carabiners, quickdraws, harnesses, active and passive climbing protection, belay devices, helmets, ice tools and piolets, crampons, ice screws, bouldering pads, and big wall equipment. They also produce skiing and avalanche safety equipment. The company&#x27;s mountain products include tents and shelters, lighting, trekking poles, and backpacks.

Over the years, Black Diamond has acquired and integrated several gear companies into its line, including Bibler tents (1997), Ascension climbing skins (1999), and Franklin climbing products (1998). In 2010, they acquired Gregory Mountain Products, a manufacturer of backpacks, but later sold it to luggage maker Samsonite in 2014.

Notable Black Diamond products include spring-loaded camming devices called Camalot and Magnetron carabiners, auto-locking carabiners that use magnets in the gate, and a steel insert in the carabiner&#x27;s nose for added security.

As is common in safety-equipment industries, Black Diamond have issued many product recalls following safety concerns.

==Social justice and environmentalism==

When the Instagram page of Black Diamond posted a black page in solidarity with anti–police violence protesters on June 5, 2020, in which Black Diamond pledged $250,000 to support access to the outdoors by athletes of color, the company acknowledged it was aware of &quot;widespread concerns&quot; about its &quot;association&quot; with Clarus Corporation chief executive Warren Kanders, who also leads Safariland, the company which manufactured the tear gas widely used against protesters. Activists have 
called for a boycott of
Black Diamond over these ties, which has been embraced by various climbing-related organizations. Safariland announced the divestiture of its crowd control products divisions, including tear gas, on June 9, 2020. 
The Clarus Corporation also faced criticism for a lack of diversity from pension fund giant CalPERS, who recommended in June 2020 that Clarus shareholders vote against re-electing executive chairman and largest shareholder Warren Kanders and two other board members. CalPERS owns 52,000 shares out of approximately 29,759,000 outstanding shares, or 0.175 percent. On June 9, 2020, Warren Kanders and other board members were re-elected to the board of directors. 

Black Diamond&#x27;s parent the Clarus Corporation also owned ammunition company Sierra Bullets until its sale in 2024. In 2018, the company monitored discussions regarding the role of guns in the outdoor industry for boycotts.

Former Black Diamond CEO Peter Metcalf had a history of political advocacy for both the outdoor industry and the public lands of Utah, and united with other outdoor companies against policies that threaten public lands and outdoor recreation. 

Black Diamond says that they recycle as much waste as possible, make substantial use of wind and solar power, and support environmental non-profit bodies.

<doc id="698382" wikidata="Q1457061" url="?curid=698382" title="Tvangeste">
<text>Tvangeste is a Russian/Canadian symphonic black metal duo composed of husband and wife Mikhail &quot;Miron&quot; Chirva and Naturelle Chirva.

The band&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Twangste&quot; (also spelled as &quot;Tuwangste&quot;, &quot;Tvankste&quot; or &quot;Twankste&quot;), an Old Prussian word meaning &quot;Dam&quot;. Twangste was also the name of a small Old Prussian village roughly located at what is now the city of Kaliningrad (known as Königsberg until 1946) that was seized in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights. In the site of the settlement, the now-demolished Königsberg Castle was built. (The House of Soviets now stands on the former site of the castle.)

==Biography==
Tvangeste was formed in 1996 in Kaliningrad, Russia, and its line-up at the time consisted of Miron Chirva, Edgar, Nikolay &quot;Kok&quot; Kazmin and Klaus. However, in the following year, Edgar and Klaus left the band and were replaced by Asmodey and Julia. In 1998 they released two demo singles, &quot;Thinking...&quot; (that would be later re-recorded and included in their debut album) and &quot;Blood Dreams&quot;. Asmodey and Julia would leave shortly after, being replaced by Viktoria Kulbachnaya (from Romowe Rikoito) and Vano Mayarov (also known as Vanoe Mayoroff or Mayorov). With this line-up, Tvangeste released their debut full-length in 2000, &quot;Damnation of Regiomontum&quot;, via now-defunct Norwegian record label Valgarder.

In 2001, Miron&#x27;s then-girlfriend Naturelle joined the band, and in 2003 their second studio album, &quot;Firestorm&quot;, was released, via also now-defunct Japanese label Worldchaos Production. Polish musician Cezary Mielko worked as a session drummer on it. Also in 2003, Max Naumov joined the band, and Tvangeste became a quintet.

In 2005, Miron and Naturelle married and moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, while the three remaining members decided to stay in Russia. Around the same time Miron also provided vocals for Israeli black metal band Arafel&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Second Strike: Through the Flame of the Ages&quot;.

Since 2006 Miron and Naturelle are working on Tvangeste&#x27;s third studio album. Tentatively titled &quot;Satori&quot; (Japanese for &quot;Illumination&quot;), it was scheduled to be released via their own independent record label, Regiomontum Productions. Norwegian musician Jørn Øyhus served as a session drummer, and the orchestral instrumentation was provided by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, according to Miron. Having a long and convoluted production history, it currently has no set release date.

On 7 September 2016 the band announced on their official Facebook page the death of their former bassist/guitarist, Vano Mayarov.

<doc id="698391" wikidata="Q181512" url="?curid=698391" title="Vivian Woodward">
<text>Vivian John Woodward (3 June 1879 – 31 January 1954) was an English footballer who enjoyed the peak of his career from the turn of the 20th century to the outbreak of the First World War. He played for Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.

Internationally, Woodward captained Great Britain to gold medals at the 1908 Olympics in London and in Stockholm in 1912, and made a combined 59 international appearances for a combination of England, England Amateurs, and Great Britain. His combined record for England of 75 goals in 53 matches (1.42 goals a game) is still the highest international record of any player to have scored more than 50 goals for their country, whilst his record of 75 goals is still the highest combined total of international goals scored by any English footballer. Woodward took part in ten British Home Championships, lifting the trophy eight times. In the 1903-04 Home Championship, Woodward was the top scorer with 4 goals, whilst in the 1908-09 tournament he was the joint top goalscorer with 3 goals. Woodward is the 5th highest all-time record goalscorer of the Home Championship with 14 goals in total.

He served in the British Army during the First World War, and as a result missed out on Chelsea&#x27;s run to their first-ever FA Cup final in 1915. Woodward&#x27;s injuries during the war caused his retirement from football. He then served on Cheleas&#x27;s Board between 1922 and 1930 as a director of the club.

== Club career ==
An architect by profession, Woodward began his career at Clacton Town. Following spells at Harwich &amp; Parkeston and Chelmsford, he joined Tottenham Hotspur in March 1901, who in the same year would win the FA Cup. Woodward&#x27;s debut for Tottenham occurred in the Southern League on 6 April 1901 in a home match against Bristol City which Spurs won 1–0. Due to work and cricket commitments, he did not begin to appear regularly for the team until the 1902–03 season. In nine seasons at White Hart Lane, he made 169 appearances and scored 73 goals. Tottenham was elected to the Second Division of the Football League for the 1908–09 season, and Woodward scored Spurs&#x27; first-ever goal in the Football League in September 1908 against Wolverhampton Wanderers that finished 3–0. He helped the team win promotion to the First Division that season.

Before the start of the 1909 season, Woodward decided to retire to concentrate on his architectural practice and cricket. He had a short spell back with Chelmsford, but was persuaded to join David Calderhead&#x27;s Chelsea on 20 November 1909. He went on to play in a total of 116 games for them, scoring 34 goals. He was their leading scorer in the 1912–13 season with ten goals.

At the start of the First World War Woodward enlisted in the British Army and as a result did not play many matches during the 1914–15 season. He was given special leave to join Chelsea at Old Trafford for the FA Cup Final as Bob Thomson was injured, however Thomson recovered and Woodward refused to play, believing it was immoral to deny Thomson his chance to play in an FA Cup final as Woodward himself had not played in any of Chelsea&#x27;s matches in their run to the final.

In January 1916, Woodward was injured in the right thigh by a German Grenade whilst fighting for Britain in the Great War. Following this injury he was unable to return to top-tier football, returning to his first club, Clacton Town before retiring.

== International career ==
He made his England debut in 1903, scoring twice in a 4–0 win against Ireland. Between 1903 and 1911, he won 23 full caps and scored 29 goals, setting an English record that would last until the 1950s. He also played in three unofficial international matches against South Africa in 1910, scoring a further four goals. At the time, England only usually played three matches a season, for the British Home Championship, but two tours to central Europe in 1908 and 1909 netted Woodward 15 goals (over half his total). He held the overall England goalscoring record, either jointly or alone, for 47 years – longer than any other player until surpassed by Tom Finney in 1958. With his 28th and 29th goals, the last of his career, he overhauled Steve Bloomer against Wales in March 1911, and was not himself overtaken until Tom Finney scored his 30th (and last) goal in October 1958.

He also turned out 44 times for England Amateurs and scored 57 goals. England Amateurs played most of its internationals against the full representative sides of Europe, whose football was much less developed than that of the British at the time, and this huge gap between them often resulted in the Europeans getting trashed by the English, and Woodward would thus often score several goals per match. For instance, in one match against France in 1906, the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sporting Life&quot; credit Woodward with eight goals in a 15–0 win, although FIFA&#x27;s official record of the match credits him with only four goals. However, he did score six against Netherlands in 1909.

The Home Nations did not recognise its matches against England Amateurs, and thus, 12 goals in 14 of his appearances are considered unofficial, four against Ireland, six against Wales, and 2 goals in an unofficial match against Sweden on 12 June 1914 as this game was not regarded as a full international by the Swedish Football Association. However, the remaining 30 appearances for England amateurs and 46 goals (including 6 matches and 5 goals for Great Britain at the Olympics) were made in matches recognised as full internationals by FIFA and the opposition&#x27;s Football Associations, though not by the FA, which means that Woodward scored a total of 75 goals in 53 matches that were considered official internationals by the opposing sides, which would make him the first footballer to score 50 international goals, ahead of Imre Schlosser, who achieved it on 3 June 1917. Woodward scored a combined total of 10 international hat-tricks for the England teams, 4 for the main side and 6 for the Amateurs, all of which in friendlies sept for the one he netted against Wales at the 1907–08 British Home Championship on 16 March 1908, which is also the only one he netted against a Home Nation. His hat-trick tally also includes a 6-goal haul in a 9–1 win over the Netherlands on 11 December 1909, and four 4-goal hauls, two for each of the England teams.

Woodward also represented the Football League XI and the Southern League XI. He also toured the United States with The Pilgrims in 1905.

== Olympic career ==
Woodward captained Great Britain to gold medals at the 1908 Olympics in London and then in Stockholm in 1912, scoring three goals in 1908, including one in the final, and other two in 1912.

== Military career ==
He joined the 17th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. This was one of the Pals battalions formed during the early stages of World War I. It was known as a &quot;Footballers Battalion&quot; and it included many members of Woodward&#x27;s former team Tottenham Hotspur. He served on the Western Front and was wounded in 1916. He attained the rank of Captain.

<text>The Canadian Masters was a professional snooker tournament.

==History==
The tournament was first held in 1974 and was named Canadian Open in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was part of Canadian National Exhibition Week. It was however discontinued after it clashed with the early start of the Main Tour. The event was revived in 1985, and was retitled as Canadian Masters. It was an eight-man invitation event held at the CBC Television Studios. The tournament was sponsored by BCE in 1985 and 1986.

In 1987 the tournament became part of the World Series and Labatt&#x27;s overtook sponsorship of the event. In 1989 it became the first ranking event held overseas, although only the stages from the last 32 were held in Canada. BCE sponsored the tournament, which was won by Jimmy White, who defeated Steve Davis 9–4 to win £40,000.

It was held in the Minkler Auditorium, with the crowd filling the 1000 seats (Seneca Village, 1750 Finch Ave E, Toronto M2H)

<text>Giovanni &quot;John&quot; Zatara, simply called Zatara, is a fictional magician and superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 in 1938 during the Golden Age of Comic Books, making him one of DC Comics&#x27; oldest characters.

The character is often depicted as a stage magician who possesses genuine magical abilities and is recognized as the father of the mystic character Zatanna, and is the uncle of Zachary Zatara, who uses the &quot;Zatara&quot; name. Within the fictional DC Universe, he has made intermittent appearances, primarily serving as a supporting character to Zatanna and is typically deceased in modern settings. The character&#x27;s proficiency as a sorcerer earned him a notable reputation among his contemporaries as a powerful sorcerer of his generation rivalling other such as the original incarnation of Doctor Fate and has made him a mentor figure to others such as Batman (in escapology) and John Constantine. In the character&#x27;s original conception, he was portrayed as Zatanna&#x27;s human parent, while her mother Sindella served as the homo magi parent. However, following the New 52 reboot, the character&#x27;s origin underwent a change, revealing that his family lineage also included a descent from homo magi.

Zatara has made various appearances in media, such as &quot;&quot;, in which he is voiced by Vincent Schiavelli, and &quot;Young Justice&quot;, voiced by Nolan North.

==Publication history==

He first appeared starring in his own story &quot;Zatara Master Magician&quot; by writer and artist Fred Guardineer in the anthology American comic book series &quot;Action Comics&quot;, starting with the first issue (June 1938). According to writer Al Sulman, &quot;the time came when [Fred Guardineer] didn&#x27;t want to draw [the Zatara series] anymore, so the editor turned it over to my brother [Joe Sulman], and he began to draw the strip; but he had to imitate Fred Guardineer&#x27;s drawing style, because the character had to look [the same], and it worked out fine&quot;.

John Zatara is introduced as a magician in various publications of DC Comics, beginning with 1938&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, best known for also containing the first appearance of Superman. Like the very similar Mandrake the Magician, Zatara had a large East Indian as a friend/bodyguard, called Tong, to share his early adventures.

As well as being an illusionist, Zatara also had genuine magical powers (decades later ascribed to being a descendant of the &quot;Homo magi&quot;), which he focused through speaking backwards: he could do anything so long as he could describe it in (&quot;backwards speech&quot;). This helped distinguish Zatara from the numerous Mandrake the Magician knockoffs that cluttered the comics and pulp magazines of the day, although Merlin the Magician (Quality Comics) also had this attribute, and it was also given to him by Zatara&#x27;s creator, Fred Guardineer. According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;he fights Egyptian wizards, an evil Druid, Zulus, a Mad Lama, Mongol warriors, the Gorilla King, a Saturnian terror, and Moon Men&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

=== Origin ===
Giovanni Zatara originates from an Italian family with strong magical lineage. His grandfather, Luigi Zatara, is a renowned stage magician who served as a significant inspiration. At a young age, Giovanni receives a magic kit that triggers his passion for illusion and prompts him to pursue a career as a professional magician. However, his early attempts at performing are met with disappointment until he recognizes the importance of honing his showmanship skills. While attempting to translate Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s journals, Giovanni learns that he can use magic by speaking words backward. Combining his natural gifts with his stage magic expertise, Giovanni becomes an esteemed stage magician and crime-fighter.

The character&#x27;s origin was later updated, making him a descendant of the &quot;Homo magi&quot;, an off-shoot race of human beings with natural inclination to magic. Additionally, he is visited by the Phantom Stranger, who grants him access to his ancestor&#x27;s books, helping him to control his magic.

=== Earlier adventures and life ===
During his earlier years as both a stage magician and sorcerer, Giovanni had a close and casual relationship with Madame Xanadu. He had previously proposed to her for marriage, but she rejected his proposal upon discovering knowledge of his future. However, their relationship became strained when Giovanni recounted his past life and revealed his profound connection with the Phantom Stranger. The Phantom Stranger had served as Giovanni&#x27;s mentor, guiding him through the realm of magical teachings during his earlier years. Xanadu, perceiving the Phantom Stranger as a person of questionable character and moral integrity, became angered by Giovanni&#x27;s revelation. She believed that the Stranger&#x27;s actions would give rise to a greater threat than the Stranger himself. Xanadu, considering the Stranger to be morally inferior, insulted Giovanni&#x27;s fondness for him, nearly escalating the situation into a confrontation between the two. However, the Phantom Stranger intervened and attempted to reconcile with Xanadu, acknowledging the unintended suffering he had caused her. Despite not intending to do so, the Stranger sought to make amends. Ultimately, the Phantom Stranger managed to escape Xanadu&#x27;s capture. Unaware of the conversation that had taken place due to being within a time-freezing spell, Xanadu departed from Giovanni. As Xanadu had premonitions, her foresight came to pass with the birth of the bond between the Spectre and Jim Corrigan, confirming the validity of her earlier visions.

Zatara became good friends with Thomas Wayne. His excursions with Wayne led to Wayne meeting his wife, Martha. After the two were killed, Zatara left Gotham City, blaming himself for being unable to stop the orphaning of young Bruce. Eventually, in Europe, Zatara would meet and wed Sindella, who gave birth to their daughter, Zatanna. Sindella seemingly died after giving birth to Zatanna, prompting Zatara to become a depressed drunk. Things changed for the better in Zatara&#x27;s life when a young Bruce Wayne arrived, requesting Zatara to teach him to become an escape artist and illusionist. Bruce&#x27;s appearance prompted Zatara to address his alcoholism.

===Zatanna&#x27;s search===
Zatanna, Zatara&#x27;s daughter by Sindella, a fellow &quot;Homo magi&quot;, is introduced in a multipart crossover in which she attempts to find her father, and he attempts to stop her due to a curse that will kill them both if they see one another. This adventure includes Zatara confronting an evil warlock in a world where nothing changes or grows older. Zatara steals his adversary&#x27;s teleportation crystal in an attempt to stop the man from invading Earth. The sorceress Allura traps Zatara in the land of Kharma before her identically-named twin forces her to remove the spell.

===Death and afterlife===
In Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;American Gothic&quot; storyline, Zatara sacrifices himself to save Zatanna from the Great Evil Beast. He has largely remained dead since, appearing as a spirit in several stories and as a Black Lantern in &quot;Blackest Night&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
The character&#x27;s ancestral heritage is primarily traced back to French and Italian descent, with notable connections to historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Nostradamus, Alessandro Cagliostro, Nicolas Flamel, and Evan Fulcanelli. Initially, the character was presented as an ordinary human possessing the ability to manipulate magic. However, his origin underwent an update, revealing him to be a &quot;Homo magi&quot; with innate magical abilities. In addition to having a daughter (Zatanna) and a nephew (Zachary), the character was once mentioned to have a son.

== Powers and abilities ==
Giovanni is considered a master magician, being considered among the best of his generation. Due to his abilities in magic, he possess profound knowledge of the supernatural and is notable a magical practitioner who invokes magical effects and casts spells by speaking a spell or phrase backwards for a desired effect (known as &quot;Logomancy&quot;). He is often depicted as being peers to other notable sorcerers and magicians of his generation, including Sargon the Sorcerer, Mister E, and Baron Winters. His distinction as being the most powerful sorcerer of his time is also shared alongside the first Doctor Fate, Kent Nelson. In addition to his magical abilities, he is considered a skilled and proficient stage magician and a master of predestigination. Giovanni also possess masterful manipulation skills, enabling him to manipulate even fellow master manipulator magicians such as John Constantine, who found his abilities in doing so considerable and was unable to reveal to Zatanna the full extent of their relationship for reasons unknown.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
Another Zatara was featured in a supporting role in the miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; and its follow-up, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;. This Zatara is the son of Zatanna and magician John Constantine, which makes him the grandson of the original. He is described as &quot;a youthful Harry Houdini-like successor to the magician super-hero lineage&quot;. Rather than speak backwards just for his spells, however, he does it all the time, which annoys his colleagues no end.

===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; crossover event, Zatara was transformed into a motorcycle; his daughter, Zatanna is his owner.

<text>Pen Ran (, ), (c. 1944 – c. 1979) also commonly known as Pan Ron in some Romanized sources intended for English-speaking audiences, was a Cambodian singer and songwriter who was at the height of her popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s. Known particularly for her western rock and soul influences, flirtatious dancing, and risque lyrics, Pen Ran has been described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as a &quot;worldly, wise-cracking foil&quot; to the more restrained Cambodian pop singers of her era. She disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide and her fate is unknown.

==Life and career==
Very little is known of Pen Ran&#x27;s personal history. It has been established that she was from Battambang in northwestern Cambodia and attended the same school as the younger Ros Serey Sothea, another popular singer of the same era. Pen Ran had a sister named Pen Ram (sometimes Romanized as Pan Rom) who was also a singer in the later years of the Cambodian psychedelic rock scene.

In the 1960s, Cambodian Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into the country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing pop music scene based in Phnom Penh and led by singers like Sinn Sisamouth. Pen Ran was an early entrant in this music scene, with the hit song &quot;Pka Kabas&quot; in 1963, but she became a national star when she began recording with Sinn Sisamouth in 1966. Starting in the late 1960s Ran recorded many collaborations with Sisamouth and other notable Cambodian singers of the period, while continuing her solo career. The debut of the popular Ros Serey Sothea in 1967 had little effect on Pen Ran&#x27;s career and perhaps even broadened her popularity as the second leading lady of Cambodian popular music.

==Style and legacy==
Pen Ran was known for her unrestrained personality and western-oriented hairstyles and fashions, rejecting traditional demands on Khmer women and representing new and modern gender roles. Her onstage dancing and flirtatious lyrics were considered scandalous in Cambodia at the time. Translated titles of her songs indicate her risque focus on romance and sexuality (for example, &quot;I&#x27;m Unsatisfied&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Your Lover&quot;) and a rejection of traditional courtship (for example, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late Old Man&quot;). Near the end of her music career Pen Ran was still an unmarried career woman in her early thirties, which was also unusual for Cambodia at the time. She addressed this topic in the song &quot;I&#x27;m 31&quot; which was an answer to Ros Serey Sothea&#x27;s hit song &quot;I&#x27;m 16.&quot;

Pen Ran was known to be a very versatile singer, having a repertoire consisting of traditional Cambodian music, rock, twist, cha cha cha, agogo, mambo, madizon, jazz, and folk. When discussing her vocal abilities, one researcher has said &quot;Pan Ron hits notes that shatter glass.&quot; Decades later, Nick Hanover described the unique combination of Cambodian and Western influences in the track &quot;Rom Jongvak Twist&quot; as &quot;a Cambodian spin on American dance crazes that sounds less like Chubby Checker than Lydia Lunch.&quot; Throughout her career, she is believed to have performed on hundreds of songs, many of which she wrote herself.

Pen Ran disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide of the late 1970s and her exact fate is unknown. Her younger sister Pen Ram said that she survived until the Vietnamese invasion of late 1978/early 1979 when the Khmer Rouge launched their final series of mass executions. Given the goal of the Khmer Rouge to remove foreign influences from Cambodian society, Pen Ran&#x27;s individuality probably ensured her death. In a 2015 BBC documentary on the band Cambodian Space Project, who have covered many of Pen Ran&#x27;s songs, it was alleged by an interview subject that she was tricked by the Khmer Rouge into performing one of her songs, after which she was led away and executed. 

Starting in the late 1990s, interest in Pan Ron&#x27;s music was revived by the album &quot;Cambodian Rocks&quot; and similar CD compilations, while the documentary film &quot;Don&#x27;t Think I&#x27;ve Forgotten&quot; described her as one of the most influential artists of her era, as well as one of the most popular artists amongst younger Cambodians.

<text>Volker Grassmuck (born 1961 in Hannover) is a German sociologist and media researcher.

Volker Grassmuck visited Herschelschool in Hannover, spent a year at Ridgewood High in New Jersey and finished his Abitur back at Herschelschool in 1980.

He started studying sociology in 1981 in Groningen, Netherlands at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen but changed to Berlin in 1982. There he studied sociology, journalism, information science and psychology at the Freie Universität Berlin.

In the mid-1980s he worked alongside his studies publicist and founded the &quot;JetSet Verlags GmbH&quot; in 1984, which published the magazine &quot;V max - Zeitschrift auf der Überholspur&quot;. He also worked at the local radio station &quot;Radio 100&quot; as editor for the radio show &quot;Nachtflug&quot;.

Grassmuck started his academic career in 1987 with contributions to a research project and also graduated his study and started studying Japanese at the FU Berlin as well.

From 1989 he did research at the Socio-technological Research Department of Tokyo University. From 1991 he published a column in the &quot;konpyûta kagaku&quot; (Shujunsha) and worked as a video-editor for ABC News. 1992 found him as a newscaster at Radio Japan, NHK and worked as a freelancer for InterCommunication Magazine, NTT Shuppansha. At the university he researched networks with Dr. Kubota Akihiro.

Grassmuck returned to Berlin in 1995, starting, together with others, &quot;mikro e. V.&quot; in 1998, a project for connecting Berlin&#x27;s media cultures. He worked together with Prof. Dr. Wolfang Coy on a DFG research project on &quot;Von der Ordnung des Wissens zur Wissensordnung digitaler Medien&quot; (&quot;From the system of knowledge to the knowledge system of digital media&quot;) at the Humboldt Universität.

He earned a doctorate at the FU Berlin on Japanese media history with the topic &quot;Closed Society. Media and discursive aspects of Japan&#x27;s &#x27;three openings&#x27;&quot;. In 2000/2001 he became a replacement professor for media art at the Universität Graphik und Buchkunst in Leipzig.

<text>You Am I are an Australian power pop band, fronted by its lead singer-songwriter and guitarist, Tim Rogers. They formed in December 1989 and are the first Australian band to have released three successive albums that have each debuted at the number-one position on the ARIA Albums Chart: &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; (February 1995), &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; (July 1996) and &quot;#4 Record&quot; (April 1998). Nine of their tracks appeared on the related ARIA Singles Chart top 50 with &quot;What I Don&#x27;t Know &#x27;bout You&quot; (February 1998), their highest charting, at No. 28. You Am I have received ten ARIA Music Awards from thirty-one nominations. The band have supported international artists such as the Who, the Rolling Stones, Sonic Youth and Oasis.

You Am I&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot;, appeared in the eighth position in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010). Their third album, &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; was listed at number fifty five. The same two releases were also voted into the &quot;Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time&quot; list compiled by Australian youth radio station, Triple J, in 2011. Fourteen of their songs have been placed on the related annual Hottest 100 lists with &quot;Heavy Heart&quot; (July 1998), the highest at No. 9.

==History==
=== 1989–1992: Formation and early years ===
You Am I were formed in Sydney in December 1989 by Tim Rogers (ex- Pleasureheads, Glazed Expression) on vocals, guitar, mellotron and Hammond organ; his older brother Jaimme Rogers on drums; and Nick Tischler on bass guitar. Tim Rogers and Tischler were old school mates. After forming, the band members began by trying to cover songs by the Hard-Ons, X, and Aerosmith.

At an early gig, a fan provided &quot;a big spiritual spiel about &#x27;... I am you... you am i...&#x27;. The band took that as the inspiration for the working title&quot; for the group&#x27;s name. This initial line-up was short-lived, Jaimme left before the end of the following year after a &quot;fight&quot; with Tim, and he was replaced by Mark Tunaley on drums. In the band&#x27;s 1993 song, &quot;Jaimme&#x27;s Got a Gal&quot;, Tim explained why his brother left.

You Am I signed with an independent label, Timberyard Records, and in May 1991 issued a six-track extended play, &quot;Snake Tide&quot;. It was recorded in February at Electric Avenue Studios with Phil Punch as engineer, mixer and co-producer with the group. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the EP as &quot;rough hewn&quot;. You Am I appeared at the inaugural Big Day Out concert, held in Sydney in January 1992.

By April 1992, Tischler had left the band &quot;because he didn&#x27;t think he could fulfill Tim&#x27;s vision&quot;. He was replaced by their previous live sound mixer, Andy Kent (ex-Pupils of Love), on bass guitar. In May they released a five-track EP, &quot;Goddamn&quot;, which was produced by Tom Kazas. An alternative nine-track version of &quot;Goddamn&quot;, which was expanded by adding four tracks from &quot;Snake Tide&quot;, was also issued. McFarlane declared that &quot;By that stage, Rogers had established his credentials as a fine songwriter and the band a reputation as an exciting, dynamic live act.&quot;

By mid-1992, they had signed with another independent label, rooArt Records, on their subsidiary rA Records, which was distributed by WEA. The group released their third EP, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot;, as a five-track set in October 1992, which was co-produced by the band with David Price. Before the end of the year You Am I supported Hoodoo Gurus on a national tour.

=== 1993–1994: Debut album: &quot;Sound as Ever&quot; ===
Late in 1992, Tim Rogers sent samples of You Am I&#x27;s releases to Lee Ranaldo of American rock group, Sonic Youth. In January 1993 both groups appeared at the second Big Day Out festival in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. While in Sydney, Ranaldo co-produced You Am I&#x27;s five-track EP, &quot;Coprolalia&quot;, which was issued in April. McFarlane opined that it was &quot;bursting with kinetic energy and first-rate songs.&quot; You Am I co-headlined a national tour from May to June, with stoner metallers, Tumbleweed.

You Am I travelled to Cannon Falls, Minnesota, United States, using Sonic Youth&#x27;s Pachyderm Recording Studios. For eight days Ranaldo produced their debut album, &quot;Sound as Ever&quot; (November 1993), with Wayne Connolly as audio engineer. It appeared on the ARIA Albums Chart top 100. Mark Morgenstein of AllMusic felt the work &quot;shows this power trio in top form, with enthusiastic backing to well-written songs... [if it] was a little more consistent, this would be a classic.&quot;

In May 2013, Rogers reminisced, &quot;I lost an incredibly important person to cancer who I still think about every day and that experience pretty much coloured the whole record.&quot; He referred to his mentor, Stephen &quot;Goose&quot; Gray of Sydney-based rock group, Box the Jesuit, who had died of lymphoma in August 1993. &quot;[Goose] would have wanted me to stay in America to finish the album so that&#x27;s what I did. But there&#x27;s no nostalgia or good feelings about that time.&quot;

In October 1993, ahead of the album&#x27;s release, Tunaley was &quot;fired from the band with a simple phone call.&quot; He had &quot;wanted to play heavier music&quot;, however Kent and Rogers &quot;wanted to play a more pop based rock&quot;. Rogers initially considered disbanding the group but continued with Russell Hopkinson (ex-Nursery Crimes) on drums, percussion and backing vocals. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 in March they won the newly created category, Best Alternative Release for &quot;Sound as Ever&quot;.

&quot;Sound as Ever&quot; provided three singles, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ribs&quot; (October 1993), &quot;Berlin Chair&quot; (February 1994) and &quot;Jaimme&#x27;s Got a Gal&quot; (May). All three received high rotation on national youth radio station, Triple J; each was listed on the station&#x27;s annual listeners&#x27; poll, Hottest 100: &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ribs&quot; at No. 50 in January 1994, &quot;Berlin Chair &quot; at No. 23 and &quot;Jaimme&#x27;s Got a Gal&quot; at No. 77 in January 1995.

===1994–1995: &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot;===
For seven days during mid-September 1994 You Am I decamped to Greene Street Studios, New York. Again they worked with Ranaldo, as producer, to record their second album, &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; which was released on 20 February 1995. Ahead of the album, in November 1994, they issued a limited pressing (449 units) of &quot;When You Got Dry&quot;/&quot;How Much Is Enough&quot; as a double-A sided vinyl single. &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; was released as a single in early February, which peaked at No. 36 on the ARIA Singles Chart. &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; reached the number-one position on the related albums chart. A limited edition version included a bonus disc, &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Crowd&quot;, which had seven live tracks recorded at their gig at Memorial Stadium, Seattle, United States on 13 August 1994.

McFarlane described the album, which &quot;remains one of the finest Australian albums of the 1990s. Full of audacious, incisive and tuneful rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll it made its debut at #1 on the mainstream national chart and went on to sell over 35000 copies.&quot; Ed Nimmervoll of HowlSpace website felt it was &quot;reflective, lyrically nostalgic&quot;; while AllMusic&#x27;s Steven McDonald wrote it was &quot;[a] cute outing that throws in thumpy drums, crunchy guitars and delightfully whiny Mellotron string noises along the way.&quot; By April 1995 the group had added Greg Hitchcock (ex-The Verys) as an auxiliary member on guitar and keyboards.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 You Am I received their second trophy for Best Alternative Album, for &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot;. They were also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Video (&quot;Jewels and Bullets&quot;, directed by Robbie Douglas-Turner) and Best Cover Art (by Simon Anderson). &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; is listed at No. 8 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010). The authors described it as &quot;a textured, immediate pop record that delves through layers of memories, looking back to consider the past even as it makes sober judgements for the future.&quot; In July 2013 it re-entered the top 50 for a week.

===1996–1997: &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot;===
You Am I&#x27;s third album, &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; was released in July 1996, was produced by the group and recorded at Q Sound Studios, Sydney in December 1995. They were assisted by engineers, Connolly and Paul McKercher, which appeared on Ra/rooArt and was distributed by Shock Records. According to Rogers &quot;[it] was my first attempt at a song cycle.&quot; McFarlane wrote that it is &quot;another album of urgent, adventurous, unabashed pure pop.&quot; Nimmervoll felt it was &quot;a nostalgic journey musically, reflecting Tim Rogers&#x27; love of The Sixties. Instead of reflecting his own life, Tim&#x27;s lyrics looked at the suburban lives of others.&quot; &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; also debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Charts, and is the first on the Shock Records label to do so upon launch. A limited edition was issued with a bonus disc of seven live tracks, &quot;Beat Party&quot;.

For their US and United Kingdom versions of &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; on WEA/Warner Bros and rooArt/BMG, in March 1997, two tracks were replaced by newly recorded material, &quot;Trike&quot; and &quot;Opportunities&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Anderson opined that &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; &quot;did little to ingratiate the group to an America fascinated with the packaging of youth culture... [it is] a conceptual piece that is obsessed with the past but without retro trappings... [Rogers&#x27; lyrics] laces together complex ideas with a narrative that transforms the pain of growing up artistic and male in Australia into a weird rock &amp; roll existentialism.&quot; The album provided five singles, with the first four reaching the top 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart: &quot;Mr. Milk&quot; (November 1995), &quot;Soldiers&quot; (July 1996), &quot;Good Mornin&#x27;&quot; (September), &quot;Tuesday&quot; (February 1997) and &quot;Trike&quot; (July). &quot;Tuesday&quot; peaked at No. 29.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996 &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot;, and the related singles, provided nine nominations, with the group winning six trophies: Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Independent Release, Producer of the Year, Best Video (&quot;Soldiers&quot;, directed by Andrew Lancaster) and Engineer of the Year (Paul McKercher and Wayne Connolly). The album was certified platinum by ARIA by the end of 1997 to acknowledge the shipment of 70000 units. It was listed at No. 55 in &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; where the authors felt the group were &quot;heavily under the spell of late &#x27;60s English music... in particular the Pretty Things&#x27; &quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot;... [which] follows the journey of the character... from birth through love, war, tragedy, madness and old age.&quot;

===1998–1999: &quot;#4 Record&quot;===
Subtle country influences were apparent on You Am I&#x27;s &quot;#4 Record&quot;, released in April 1998, such as the track, &quot;Heavy Heart&quot;. It was produced by George Drakoulias in Los Angeles, which was their third number-one album in a row – they are the first Australian band to do so. McFarlane believes it is &quot;lean, nifty rock’n’roll&quot;; Nimmervoll wrote it was a &quot;back-to-basics&quot; album. The limited edition version included a bonus disc of nine tracks, &quot;Radio Settee&quot;. By that time the rooArt label had been acquired by BMG.

The album provided three singles, &quot;What I Don&#x27;t Know &#x27;bout You&quot; (February 1998), &quot;Rumble&quot; (April) and &quot;Heavy Heart&quot; (July). &quot;What I Don&#x27;t Know &#x27;bout You&quot; is their highest-charting single, which peaked at No. 28; whereas &quot;Heavy Heart&quot; is their highest placed track on any annual Triple J Hottest 100, which was listed at No. 9, in January 1999.

By July 1999, the line-up of the group was augmented by Davey Lane of The Pictures on second guitar. Lane came to the band&#x27;s attention via his work with The Pictures and by accurately transcribing You Am I&#x27;s guitar tabs from &quot;#4 Record&quot; on an early fan site. Lane said – on &quot;The Cream &amp; the Crock&quot; (November 2003) video documentary – that he almost decided not to be a part of the band, as he was &quot;fucking up his favourite band by playing in it&quot; after he had played his first show with them and stuffed up his solos.

Jack Rabid of AllMusic described &quot;#4 Record&quot;, which &quot;beguiles, teases, sweetens, and often throbs in popcraft. It also blasts in fits and starts of harsh edge, chops, infectious attitude, and, when it suits them, abandon.&quot; Sarah Zupko of PopMatters website felt it &quot;keeps the power in power pop&quot; and compared their sound with &quot;early Who, early Jam, Sloan and a touch of the Rolling Stones, but with horns.&quot;

You Am I recorded their first live album, &quot;...Saturday Night, &#x27;Round Ten&quot;, over a three-night series of gigs at Casa del Resaca, a warehouse in Richmond, in July 1999. It was released in September and includes Lane on guitar. McFarlane noticed that they provided &quot;a strong, swaggering live outing that confirmed the band&#x27;s standing as one of the country&#x27;s premier rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll acts.&quot; It peaked at No. 7 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The limited edition version included a five-track CD-ROM.

===2000–2001: &quot;Dress Me Slowly&quot;===
After three years between studio albums, due to touring and record label interference, You Am I released &quot;Dress Me Slowly&quot; in April 2001 on BMG. It was Lane&#x27;s first appearance on a studio album, which was produced by Clif Norrell. According to Nimmervoll the group were &quot;under a lot of pressure to &#x27;write hits&#x27; and &#x27;play the game&#x27; for the sake of their US breakthrough.&quot; The album debuted at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart.
Anderson felt it was &quot;[s]ubtly toned down, yet still spunky with its clever lyrics and pure guitar pop ... [with] slightly more serious material with all the verve and personality fans should expect.&quot; Bill Partsch of Trouser Press opined that &quot;the sound is more muscular... the album is tasty and satisfying, but not especially divine.&quot; Nimmervoll declared that &quot;[r]ather than compromising You Am I went straight to the heart of what [they] should sound like as far as the band is concerned.&quot;

The limited edition version of &quot;Dress Me Slowly&quot; included an eight-track disc, &quot;The Temperance Union&quot;, which were solo recordings by Rogers and studio musicians. Three singles were released from the standard album, &quot;Damage&quot; (October 2000), &quot;Get Up&quot; (March 2001) and &quot;Kick a Hole in the Sky&quot; (July).

===2002–2004: &quot;Deliverance&quot;===
You Am I&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, was recorded in January 2002 and released in September 2002. It did not receive the kind of critical and commercial success that the band&#x27;s earlier work had enjoyed. It was produced by McKercher and peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Nimmervoll explained that the group&#x27;s problems with BMG were reflected in the album, which &quot;was the aftermath of that painful episode, relaxed, eclectic, self-produced, and stubbornly without anything resembling a &#x27;hit&#x27; single.&quot; The band released &quot;Who Put the Devil in You&quot; as a download-only internet single in the same month.

In September 2003, You Am I were dropped by record label BMG after &quot;the company refused to support a tour of the US.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Hal Horowitz noticed it was &quot;a slight departure from their existing catalog, &quot;Deliverance&quot; nonetheless delivers the pop-rock goods... The acoustic guitars that propel much of the last half of the disc don&#x27;t soften the band&#x27;s sound as much as muss it up, adding a rootsy, more organic texture.&quot;

At the Falls Festival held at Marion Bay over New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2004–05, You Am I were scheduled to play a set. Rogers appeared on stage heavily intoxicated and, when a fight broke out between Rogers and Lane, the group were forced off stage much to the disappointment of festival goers. Rogers also accidentally knocked fellow artist, Missy Higgins, over. Missy Higgins and The Beautiful Girls were re-called onto stage to do a quick impromptu performance to fill the hour set-time.

===2005–2007: &quot;Convicts&quot;===
In late 2005, You Am I recorded their seventh studio album entitled &quot;Convicts&quot; with producer Greg Wales. The title is believed to be a tongue in cheek dig of English people referring to Australians as convicts because of their First Fleet origins. It may also refer to the alternative name used by the band to perform secret gigs during the &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot;–&quot;#4 Record&quot; era. The album was released on 13 May 2006 on the band&#x27;s new record label, Virgin. The &quot;Convicts&quot; album was also released in the USA on Yep Roc Records. The band toured America in the autumn and summer of 2007 to promote the record.

===2008–2009: &quot;Dilettantes&quot;===

The band&#x27;s 8th studio album, &quot;Dilettantes&quot;, was released on 13 September 2008, alongside the radio-only single Erasmus. The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Australian Music charts, and number twelve on the overall chart.

In August 2010, it was announced that they had left EMI to sign with new Sydney label Other Tongues.

===2010–2014 :&quot;You Am I&quot;===

The band&#x27;s ninth self-titled album was released on 8 October 2010. In an interview with music journalist Nick Milligan on 24 September 2010, Rogers said of the ninth You Am I album:
I&#x27;m still bewildered by this record. I haven&#x27;t gotten my head around it. It was extraordinary making it and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve finished the creation of it. I&#x27;m still yet to understand it. I like that. I think with previous records I felt I understood what went on and what we were supposed to do. What [each album’s] references were. With this [record] I just let myself freefall into it and get lost in the creation of it. I haven&#x27;t got a grasp on it and I&#x27;m enjoying the exhilaration of that. I&#x27;m still listening to this record wondering who the person was that wrote that ... and whether I&#x27;d like to meet him.

To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album, reissues of &quot;Sound As Ever&quot;, &quot;Hi Fi Way&quot; and &quot;Hourly Daily&quot; were released on 7 June 2013. A limited-edition beer brewed by the Sydney brewery Young Henrys was sold in conjunction under the name &#x27;Brew Am I&#x27;.
===2015–2019: &quot;Porridge &amp; Hotsauce&quot;===
You Am I&#x27;s tenth studio album was released on 6 November 2015. Recorded in Daptone Studios in New York, the album has been described as having &#x27;lashings of Big Star-esque power pop&#x27;.

===2020–present: &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;===
In December 2020, You Am I were listed at number 41 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &#x27;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&#x27; issue.

On 24 February 2021, You am I released &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, the lead single from their 11th studio album, &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;. The album entered the Australian charts at No. 2, marking their first Top 3 album since &quot;Dress Me Slowly&quot; in 2001.

==Live performances==
After recording &quot;Sound as Ever&quot; in August 1993, You Am I had performed &quot;a handful of American showcase gigs.&quot; At the Big Day Out festival in January 1994 they performed at the Gold Coast and Auckland shows, alongside Soundgarden. They undertook another Australian tour supporting Hoodoo Gurus and then US visitors, Redd Kross during April. In July and August You Am I supported Soundgarden on a six-week tour of North America. In 1996 You Am I played at the Lollapalooza festival and then supported Lemonheads on a tour of UK and other parts of Western Europe. In March 1997 they toured the US, again supporting Lemonheads. They headlined the Homebake festival&#x27;s Melbourne concert in January 1998. In the following month they supported Oasis, during the UK group&#x27;s first-ever Australian tour. Subsequently, they toured Hong Kong and Japan supporting Oasis.

The Strokes supported You Am I during their first tour of Australia, in July 2001. The opening show took place at The Arena in Brisbane, and they also played four shows at the Newtown Theatre in Sydney. On 29 January 2005 the group performed at WaveAid, which was to raise money for the relief effort after hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tidal wave disaster. In July and August 2007 they opened for Smoking Popes on a US tour.

You Am I performed at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief, a benefit concert for victims of the Black Saturday Victorian bushfires and the Queensland Floods. They performed at the 2010 NRL Grand Final in October.

The band was the pre-match entertainment for the 2015 SANFL Grand Final played at the Adelaide Oval. For frontman Tim Rogers who grew up in Adelaide and is a supporter of SANFL club Sturt (who did not play in the game) and attended over 600 games as a youngster (including getting his first kiss at one game), it will be his first time performing at the leagues showcase event.

==Side projects==
In 1999, front man Tim Rogers released his first solo album &quot;What Rhymes With Cars And Girls&quot;.

In the four years between &quot;Deliverance&quot; and You Am I&#x27;s next album, &quot;Convicts&quot;, both Lane and Rogers kept busy with their own solo projects. Lane performed at the 2004 ARIA Music Awards as part of the supergroup The Wrights, featuring members of many other Australian rock bands, and in 2005 released an LP with The Pictures, &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;. Rogers released two albums with The Temperance Union in this period — &quot;Spit Polish&quot; in 2004 and the &quot;Dirty Ron/Ghost Songs&quot; double album in 2005.

===Former members===
Jaimme Rogers and Nick Tischler were in an early incarnation of the band, lasting December 1989 to the end of 1990. This line-up is not known to have recorded any music.

Mark Tunaley was the band&#x27;s first &quot;official&quot; drummer, and is You Am I&#x27;s only drummer to date to employ heavy metal style of drumming, which included double bass drum parts. He left the group shortly after the recording of &quot;Sound As Ever&quot;, due to differing perceptions of the band&#x27;s direction. His sole songwriting contribution to the band (&#x27;Off The Field&#x27;) was left off the US release of the album.

Greg Hitchcock, formerly of The Verys, was a touring member of the band for the &quot;Hourly, Daily&quot; era. He played guitar and electric piano with the band for some time up until &quot;#4 Record&quot;. He was never formally a member of the band, but appeared in the video clips for &#x27;Soldiers&#x27;, &#x27;Good Mornin&#x27; and &#x27;Tuesday&#x27; (though ironically not in the &#x27;Trike&#x27; clip, on which he actually played the organ solo). Rogers later said that he was never quite comfortable with the electric piano on stage because he felt the band lost its spontaneous feel.

<text>Wizards of OS (Wizards of Operating Systems, or &quot;WOS&quot;) was a semi-annual Berlin-based conference that was held four times between 1999 and 2006. Its topics were the cultural and political potentials of free software, software technology, digital networks and media, and more generally information freedom and open cooperation in the creation and proliferation of knowledge. The conference was interdisciplinary, and included among its attendees scientists, engineers, social researchers, scholars from the humanities, artists and activists.

The name was a word play on The Wizard of Oz. The acronym &quot;OS&quot; stands for operating system (not open source).

==Individual conferences==
The first Wizards of OS conference took place in 1999.

The third conference took place in 2004, with the subtitle &quot;The Future of the Digital Commons&quot;. It featured, among others, the launch of the German translation of the Creative Commons licenses.

Wizards of OS 4 took place from September 14 to September 16, 2006, with the subtitle &quot;Information Freedom Rules&quot;. Some of the topics were the future of Creative Commons, open music and the compensation of artists and European copyright legislation. Larry Sanger announced an initial proposal of his project Citizendium.

<text>Dame Quentin Alice Louise Bryce, (née Strachan, 23 December 1942) is an Australian academic who served as the 25th Governor-General of Australia from 2008 to 2014. She is the first woman to have held the position, and was previously the 24th Governor of Queensland from 2003 to 2008.

Born in Brisbane, Queensland, Bryce was raised in Ilfracombe, with her family subsequently living in a number of country towns around Australia. She attended the University of Queensland, where she completed a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws, becoming one of the first women accepted to the Queensland Bar.

In 1968, Bryce became the first woman appointed as a faculty member of the law school where she had studied, and in 1978 she joined the new National Women&#x27;s Advisory Council (later National Women&#x27;s Consultative Council and then Australian Council for Women). This was followed by appointment to a number of positions, including the first director of the Queensland Women&#x27;s Information Service, the Queensland Director of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner in 1988. Her services to the community saw her appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1988, and a Companion of the Order of Australia and Dame of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in 2003. In 2011, Elizabeth II invested Bryce as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order at Government House.

Bryce was appointed Governor of Queensland in 2003. Although concerns were raised by some over her time in the office, her five-year term was going to be extended until 2009. However, on 13 April 2008, it was announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that Bryce was to become the next Governor-General of Australia. The decision was generally well-received and on 5 September 2008 Bryce was sworn in, succeeding Major General Michael Jeffery and becoming the first woman to hold the office. Bryce&#x27;s tenure was not without criticism. In an unprecedented move for an incumbent governor-general, Bryce made public comments in November 2013 widely interpreted as supporting an Australian republic and same-sex marriage. She was succeeded by General Sir Peter Cosgrove as governor-general on 28 March 2014.

==Early life and education==

Quentin Alice Louise Strachan was born in 1942 in Brisbane, the second of four daughters. Her parents, Norman Walter Strachan and Edwina Naida Wetzel, had taken up residence at Ilfracombe in 1940. Bryce—along with all of the children in her family—received home-schooling rather than attending the local State school. Her family left the area in 1949, initially relocating to Launceston, Tasmania, where they remained for approximately a year. Returning to Queensland, her family moved to Belmont. While living in Belmont she attended the Camp Hill State School, and there first met her future husband, Michael Bryce. She was a member of Girl Guides Australia as a Brownie.

During the period that they were residing in Belmont, her father moved to Tenterfield, New South Wales. In 1956, Quentin Strachan started attending boarding school at Moreton Bay College, Wynnum, Brisbane.

Upon graduating from high school, Quentin Strachan undertook studies at the University of Queensland, initially enrolling in a social work and arts degree, but transferring to law in her third year at the institution. She graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Arts in 1962 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1965. That year she became one of the first women to be admitted to the Queensland Bar, although she never practised professionally.

Quentin Strachan married Michael Bryce on 12 December 1964; the couple have two daughters and three sons. Michael Bryce died on 15 January 2021, aged 82 years.

==Career==

After spending some time in London, Bryce returned to Australia and accepted a part-time tutoring position at the T. C. Beirne School of Law at the University of Queensland in 1968, thus becoming the first woman to be appointed to the faculty. In 1969 she took up a lecturing position at the law school, and she continued to teach at the university until 1983.

In 1978 the Fraser government formed the National Women&#x27;s Advisory Council and Bryce was &quot;vaulted to prominence&quot; with her appointment to the council, taking on the role of convener in 1982. In 1984 she became the first director of the Queensland Women&#x27;s Information Service under the umbrella of the Office of the Status of Women and was appointed as the &quot;women&#x27;s representative on the National Committee on Discrimination in Employment and Occupation&quot;. In 1987 she became the Queensland director of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC).

Over a five-year period (1988–1993) Bryce served as Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner during the time of the Hawke Labor government. Her time in the role was a busy one, with around 2,000 complaints being handled by the commission each year and the work difficult and complex. The period was also noted as being one of &quot;galloping legal reform&quot; for the rights of women, yet, as Sandra McLean described it, Bryce kept a firm grip on the &quot;reins of change&quot; during this time. Nevertheless, concerns were raised when, in 1990, Alexander Proudfoot formally complained that the women&#x27;s health centres in the Australian Capital Territory were operating in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. This culminated in 1994 when Bryce faced an HREOC hearing after being accused of discriminating against Proudfoot – and ended when the commission found in Bryce&#x27;s favour and dismissed the complaint, stating that the behaviour in question &quot;did not reflect on the way Ms Bryce discharged her duties&quot;.

After finishing her time as the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Bryce became the founding chair and chief executive officer of the National Childcare Accreditation Council, where she remained for three years before changing direction between 1997 and 2003 when she became the principal and chief executive officer of The Women&#x27;s College within the University of Sydney, New South Wales. The move was said to have &quot;stunned her political and legal acquaintances&quot;, but Bryce saw it as bringing &quot;together all the life skills and attributes&quot; that she had acquired, as well as providing an opportunity to have an influence on the students&#x27; futures.

In other roles, Bryce has been the chair of the National Breast Cancer Advisory Council and sat on the Australian Women&#x27;s Cricket Board, and has been a member of organisations such as the YWCA, the Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation and the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital. Bryce was also a US State Department Visitor in 1978 and a Member of the Australian Delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland from 1989 to 1991.

==Governor of Queensland==

In 2003, on the recommendation of the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, appointed Bryce as Governor of Queensland, the second woman to occupy the position. Once Bryce&#x27;s nomination had been accepted by the Queen, Beattie opened it up for debate in the Legislative Assembly—an &quot;unprecedented&quot; move performed by the Premier as the first step in changing the manner by which the nominations are managed. Nevertheless, the outcome was never in doubt, as Beattie had a majority in the Legislative Assembly and had &quot;cleared the vote with the National and Liberal leaders&quot; prior to the debate.

Bryce&#x27;s time at Government House, Brisbane, was not always peaceful, but she was considered by some as a &quot;highly respected figure&quot; during her time as governor. Concerns raised in the media included the &quot;substantial&quot; exit of staff at Government House not long after Bryce became governor, as at least eight staff, including the executive office, head chef, house manager and gardener resigned or were fired during her term, and the use of Government House for private parties. In response to the latter, Beattie argued that there was nothing wrong with holding private functions at Government House, especially as Bryce had paid for the events out of her own pocket, while the Queensland Public Sector Union stated in 2008 that the staff disputes were &quot;with the management as a whole, but there wasn&#x27;t anything specific against the Governor&quot;. Staff at Queensland Government House had &quot;not [been] enthusiastic&quot; about Bryce as Queensland governor. A former staff member described Bryce as a &quot;control freak&quot;. During this time, Bryce was the Patron of Girl Guides Queensland and is the current Patron of Australian Age of Dinosaurs.

In January 2008, it was announced her initial five-year term, due to end in late July, was to be extended to cover the period of Queensland&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebrations in 2009. In making the announcement, Labor Premier Anna Bligh described how Bryce had been an &quot;inspiring leader&quot; while serving as governor, and acknowledged Bryce&#x27;s willingness to spend a &quot;great deal of time&quot; in regional and remote areas, serving as a &quot;Governor for all of Queensland&quot;. The extension did not eventuate, however, as she was appointed governor-general, and she was succeeded as Queensland governor on 29 July 2008 by Penelope Wensley.

==Governor-General of Australia==

On 13 April 2008 it was announced that, on the recommendation of the Labor Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, Queen Elizabeth II had approved Bryce&#x27;s appointment as the next Governor-General of Australia. The decision was generally well received: current and previous Labor state premiers supported her selection and both the then Leader of the Opposition, Brendan Nelson, and the leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown, spoke in favour of the decision. Patricia Edgar described Bryce&#x27;s selection as an &quot;inspired choice&quot;, while Jill Singer in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; said that the decision signalled &quot;an important about face for Australia&quot;.

There was some opposition to the appointment, in particular from columnist Des Houghton, who argued that she would bring a &quot;fair bit of baggage&quot; to the role (in reference to the controversies surrounding her time as the Governor of Queensland) and that she had failed to live up to her promise to be outspoken during her time at Government House. Concerns were also raised in August 2008, when it was revealed that Bryce intended to replace Malcolm Hazell, who had been the Official Secretary for both Major General Michael Jeffery and Peter Hollingworth, with Stephen Brady. Rudd defended Bryce&#x27;s decision, arguing that she had the right to appoint a new Official Secretary.

Bryce was sworn in on 5 September 2008. An extension of her term was announced on 24 October 2012, to expire in March 2014. During this time, she served as the Patron of Girl Guides Australia.

On the election of Bill Shorten as Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition in October 2013, Bryce offered her resignation to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, in order to forestall any perception of bias, given that Bryce&#x27;s daughter Chloe is married to Shorten. While acknowledging her magnanimity, Abbott declined to accept her resignation and asked her to serve the rest of her term. According to him Bryce provided continuity at a time of political turbulence and she should be commended for her dedication to public service.

===Controversy===
Greg Sheridan, in the national newspaper &quot;The Australian&quot;, suggested that the governor-general risked &quot;politicising and misusing the office&quot;. Sheridan was commenting on Bryce&#x27;s planned trip to Africa on behalf of the prime minister to lobby for a seat for Australia in the United Nations Security Council. He further stated that Bryce&#x27;s &quot;feigned interest in Africa will be seen cynically by Africans&quot;. Sheridan added that governors-general should travel overseas &quot;only rarely and for ceremonial purposes&quot;, and &quot;they have no right to engage in foreign policy debate, at home or abroad&quot;.

Similarly to her time as governor in Queensland, Government House in Canberra witnessed significant staff turnover, with claims that she was very difficult to work for.

In November 2013, Bryce delivered the annual ABC Boyer Lecture. Bryce stated she would like to see an Australia where &quot;people are free to love and marry whom they choose [...] And where perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation&#x27;s first head of state&quot;. Her comments drew severe criticism, not merely for their support of a republic while still serving as the Queen&#x27;s representative, but because the role is meant to be strictly non-partisan. Senator Dean Smith called them &quot;a slap in the face to many, many Australians, and a significant breach of trust&quot;. Amanda Vanstone accused her of possible grandstanding, and wrote: &quot;In publicly declaring these views, she has brought that high office into a political realm in which it does not belong ... Someone might explain to her that the job is not about her ... it&#x27;s about us.&quot; Then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported Bryce&#x27;s right to comment, saying &quot;It&#x27;s more than appropriate for the Governor-General, approaching the end of her term, to express a personal view on a number of subjects, and that&#x27;s what she was doing.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Bryce is the main patron of Girls from Oz, a charity partner of the Australian School of Performing Arts (ASPA). Girls from Oz delivers performing arts education to girls living in remote Australian communities who lack access to these opportunities.

Bryce has been a patron of Girls from Oz since its formation in 2007. Since then, Bryce has supported Girls from Oz not only through donations, but by visiting Halls Creek and Bidyadanga, two locations where the charity works, attending numerous Girls from Oz and ASPA events, and by hosting a sleep-over for girls from Halls Creek at Admiralty House on two occasions.

Bryce has also previously been a patron of both Girl Guides Queensland and Girl Guides Australia.

<text>Azerbaijanis (; , ), Azeris (, ), or Azerbaijani Turks (, ) are a Turkic ethnic group living mainly in the Azerbaijan region of northwestern Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan. They are predominantly Shia Muslims. They comprise the largest ethnic group in the Republic of Azerbaijan and the second-largest ethnic group in neighboring Iran and Georgia. They speak the Azerbaijani language, belonging to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages.

Following the Russo-Persian Wars of 1813 and 1828, the territories of Qajar Iran in the Caucasus were ceded to the Russian Empire and the treaties of Gulistan in 1813 and Turkmenchay in 1828 finalized the borders between Russia and Iran. After more than 80 years of being under the Russian Empire in the Caucasus, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was established in 1918 which defined the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

==Etymology==
Azerbaijan is believed to be named after &quot;Atropates&quot;, a Persian satrap (governor) who ruled in &quot;Atropatene&quot; (modern Iranian Azerbaijan) circa 321 BC. The name &quot;Atropates&quot; is the Hellenistic form of Old Persian &quot;Aturpat&quot; which means &#x27;guardian of fire&#x27; itself a compound of &quot;ātūr&quot; () &#x27;fire&#x27; (later &quot;ādur&quot; (آذر) in (early) New Persian, and is pronounced &quot;āzar&quot; today) + &quot;-pat&quot; () suffix for -guardian, -lord, -master (&quot;-pat&quot; in early Middle Persian, &quot;-bod&quot; (بُد) in New Persian).

Present-day name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; is the Arabicized form of &quot;Āzarpāyegān&quot; (Persian: آذرپایگان) meaning &#x27;the guardians of fire&#x27; later becoming &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; (Persian: آذربایجان) due to the phonemic shift from /p/ to /b/ and /g/ to /dʒ/ which is a result of the medieval Arabic influences that followed the Arab invasion of Iran, and is due to the lack of the phoneme /p/ and /g/ in the Arabic language. The word &quot;Azarpāyegān&quot; itself is ultimately from Old Persian &quot;Āturpātakān&quot; (Persian: آتورپاتکان) meaning &#x27;the land associated with (satrap) Aturpat&#x27; or &#x27;the land of fire guardians&#x27; (&quot;-an&quot;, here garbled into &quot;-kān&quot;, is a suffix for association or forming adverbs and plurals; e.g.: Gilan &#x27;land associated with Gil people&#x27;).

===Ethnonym===

The modern ethnonym &quot;Azerbaijani&quot; or &quot;Azeri&quot; refers to the Turkic peoples of Iran&#x27;s northwestern historic region of Azerbaijan (also known as Iranian Azerbaijan) and the Republic of Azerbaijan. They historically called themselves or were referred to by others as Muslims and/or Turks. They were also referred to as Ajam (meaning from Iran), using the term incorrectly to denote their Shia belief rather than ethnic identity. When the Southern Caucasus became part of the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century, the Russian authorities, who traditionally referred to all Turkic people as Tatars, defined Tatars living in the Transcaucasus region as Caucasian Tatars or more rarely Aderbeijanskie (Адербейджанские) Tatars or even Persian Tatars in order to distinguish them from other Turkic groups and the Persian speakers of Iran. The Russian &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot;, written in the 1890s, also referred to Tatars in Azerbaijan as Aderbeijans (адербейджаны), but noted that the term had not been widely adopted. This ethnonym was also used by Joseph Deniker in 1900.
In Azerbaijani language publications, the expression &quot;Azerbaijani nation&quot; referring to those who were known as Tatars of the Caucasus first appeared in the newspaper &quot;Kashkul&quot; in 1880.

During the early Soviet period, the term &quot;Transcaucasian Tatars&quot; was supplanted by &quot;Azerbaijani Turks&quot; and ultimately &quot;Azerbaijanis.&quot; For some time afterwards, the term &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; was then applied to all Turkic-speaking Muslims in Transcaucasia, from the Meskhetian Turks in southwestern Georgia, to the Terekemes of southern Dagestan, as well as assimilated Tats and Talysh. The temporary designation of Meskhetian Turks as &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; was most likely related to the existing administrative framework of the Transcaucasian SFSR, as the Azerbaijan SSR was one of its founding members. After the establishment of the Azerbaijan SSR, on the order of Soviet leader Stalin, the &quot;name of the formal language&quot; of the Azerbaijan SSR was also &quot;changed from Turkic to Azerbaijani&quot;.

=== Exonym ===
The Chechen and Ingush names for Azerbaijanis are &quot;Ghezloy&quot;/&quot;Ghoazloy&quot; (/) and &quot;Ghazaroy&quot;/&quot;Ghazharey&quot; (/). The former goes back to the name of Qizilbash while the latter goes back to the name of Qajars, having presumably emerged in Chechen and Ingush languages during the reign of Qajars in Iran in the 18th-19th centuries.

==History==
Ancient residents of the area, known as Azaris, spoke Old Azeri from the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. In the 11th century AD with Seljuq conquests, Oghuz Turkic tribes started moving across the Iranian Plateau into the Caucasus and Anatolia. The influx of the Oghuz and other Turkmen tribes was further accentuated by the Mongol invasion. These Turkmen tribes spread as smaller groups, a number of which settled down in the Caucasus and Iran, resulting in the Turkification of the local population. Over time they converted to Shia Islam and gradually absorbed Azerbaijan and Shirvan.

===Ancient period===
Caucasian-speaking Albanian tribes are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the region in the north of Aras river, where the Republic of Azerbaijan is located. The region also saw Scythian settlement in the ninth century BC, following which the Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras River.

Alexander the Great defeated the Achaemenids in 330 BC, but allowed the Median satrap Atropates to remain in power. Following the decline of the Seleucids in Persia in 247 BC, an Armenian Kingdom exercised control over parts of Caucasian Albania.
Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the first century BC and largely remained independent until the Persian Sassanids made their kingdom a vassal state in 252 AD.
Caucasian Albania&#x27;s ruler, King Urnayr, went to Armenia and then officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the fourth century AD, and Albania remained a Christian state until the 8th century.

===Medieval period===
Sassanid control ended with their defeat by the Rashidun Caliphate in 642 AD through the Muslim conquest of Persia. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the ninth and tenth centuries, Arab authors began to refer to the region between the Kura and Aras rivers as &quot;Arran&quot;. During this time, Arabs from Basra and Kufa came to Azerbaijan and seized lands that indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite. Conversion to Islam was slow as local resistance persisted for centuries and resentment grew as small groups of Arabs began migrating to cities such as Tabriz and Maraghah. This influx sparked a major rebellion in Iranian Azerbaijan from 816 to 837, led an Iranian Zoroastrian commoner named Babak Khorramdin. However, despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later, in the 10th and 11th centuries, parts of Azerbaijan were ruled by the Kurdish dynasty of Shaddadid and Arab Radawids.

In the middle of the eleventh century, the Seljuq dynasty overthrew Arab rule and established an empire that encompassed most of Southwest Asia. The Seljuk period marked the influx of Oghuz nomads into the region. The emerging dominance of the Turkic language was chronicled in epic poems or &quot;dastans&quot;, the oldest being the &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, which relate allegorical tales about the early Turks in the Caucasus and Asia Minor. Turkic dominion was interrupted by the Mongols in 1227, but it returned with the Timurids and then Sunni Qara Qoyunlū (Black Sheep Turkmen) and Aq Qoyunlū (White Sheep Turkmen), who dominated Azerbaijan, large parts of Iran, eastern Anatolia, and other minor parts of West Asia, until the Shi&#x27;a Safavids took power in 1501.

===Early modern period===

The Safavids, who rose from around Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and lasted until 1722, established the foundations of the modern Iranian state. The Safavids, alongside their Ottoman archrivals, dominated the entire West Asian region and beyond for centuries. At its peak under Shah Abbas the Great, it rivaled its political and ideological archrival the Ottoman empire in military strength. Noted for achievements in state-building, architecture, and the sciences, the Safavid state crumbled due to internal decay (mostly royal intrigues), ethnic minority uprisings and external pressures from the Russians, and the eventually opportunistic Afghans, who would mark the end of the dynasty. The Safavids encouraged and spread Shi&#x27;a Islam, as well as the arts and culture, and Shah Abbas the Great created an intellectual atmosphere that according to some scholars was a new &quot;golden age&quot;. He reformed the government and the military and responded to the needs of the common people.

After the Safavid state disintegrated, it was followed by the conquest by Nader Shah Afshar, a Shia chieftain from Khorasan who reduced the power of the ghulat Shi&#x27;a and empowered a moderate form of Shi&#x27;ism, and, exceptionally noted for his military genius, making Iran reach its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire. The brief reign of Karim Khan came next, followed by the Qajars, who ruled what is the present-day Azerbaijan Republic and Iran from 1779. Russia loomed as a threat to Persian and Turkish holdings in the Caucasus in this period. The Russo-Persian Wars, despite already having had minor military conflicts in the 17th century, officially began in the eighteenth century and ended in the early nineteenth century with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 and the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828, which ceded the Caucasian portion of Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire. While Azerbaijanis in Iran integrated into Iranian society, Azerbaijanis who used to live in Aran, were incorporated into the Russian Empire.

Despite the Russian conquest, throughout the entire 19th century, preoccupation with Iranian culture, literature, and language remained widespread amongst Shia and Sunni intellectuals in the Russian-held cities of Baku, Ganja and Tiflis (Tbilisi, now Georgia). Within the same century, in post-Iranian Russian-held East Caucasia, an Azerbaijani national identity emerged at the end of the 19th century. In 1891, the idea of recognizing oneself as an &quot;Azerbaijani Turk&quot; was first popularized amongst the Caucasus Tatars in the periodical &quot;Kashkül&quot;. The articles printed in &quot;Kaspiy&quot; and &quot;Kashkül&quot; in 1891 are typically credited as being the earliest expressions of a cultural Azerbaijani identity.

Modernisation—compared to the neighboring Armenians and Georgians—was slow to develop amongst the Tatars of the Russian Caucasus. According to the 1897 Russian Empire census, less than five percent of the Tatars were able to read or write. The intellectual and newspaper editor Ali bey Huseynzade (1864-1940) led a campaign to ‘Turkify, Islamise, modernise’ the Caucasian Tatars, whereas Mammed Said Ordubadi (1872-1950), another journalist and activist, criticized superstition amongst Muslims.

===Modern period in Republic of Azerbaijan===

After the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was declared, constituting what are the present-day republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. This was followed by March Days massacres that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading Musavat party adopted the name &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was proclaimed on 27 May 1918, for political reasons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sochineniya, vol II/1b&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; even though the name of &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; had been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Turkic world and Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Muslim East.

By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku. Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku&#x27;s oil. Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it, establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.

The brief independence gained by the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918–1920 was followed by over 70 years of Soviet rule. Neverthelesss, it was in the early Soviet period that the Azerbaijani national identity was forged. After the restoration of independence in October 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan became embroiled in a war with neighboring Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

The First Nagorno-Karabakh War resulted in the displacement of approximately 725,000 Azerbaijanis and 300,000–500,000 Armenians from both Azerbaijan and Armenia. As a result of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Azerbaijan took back 5 cities, 4 towns, 286 villages in the region. According to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement, internally displaced persons and refugees shall return to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent areas under the supervision of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

===Modern period in Iran===

In Iran, Azerbaijanis such as Sattar Khan sought constitutional reform. The Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906–11 shook the Qajar dynasty. A parliament (&quot;Majlis&quot;) was founded on the efforts of the constitutionalists, and pro-democracy newspapers appeared. The last Shah of the Qajar dynasty was soon removed in a military coup led by Reza Khan. In the quest to impose national homogeneity on a country where half of the population were ethnic minorities, Reza Shah banned in quick succession the use of the Azerbaijani language in schools, theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and books.

Upon the dethronement of Reza Shah in September 1941, Soviet forces took control of Iranian Azerbaijan and helped to set up the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government, a client state under the leadership of Sayyid Jafar Pishevari backed by Soviet Azerbaijan. The Soviet military presence in Iranian Azerbaijan was mainly aimed at securing the Allied supply route during World War II. Concerned with the continued Soviet presence after World War II, the United States and Britain pressured the Soviets to withdraw by late 1946. Immediately thereafter, the Iranian government regained control of Iranian Azerbaijan. According to Professor Gary R. Hess, local Azerbaijanis favored the Iranian rule, while the Soviets forewent the Iranian Azerbaijan due to the exaggerated sentiment for autonomy and oil being their top priority.

==Origins==

In many references, Azerbaijanis are designated as a Turkic people, while some sources describe the origin of Azerbaijanis as &quot;unclear&quot;, mainly Caucasian, mainly Iranian, mixed Caucasian Albanian and Turkish, and mixed with Caucasian, Iranian, and Turkic elements. Russian historian and orientalist Vladimir Minorsky writes that largely Iranian and Caucasian populations became Turkic-speaking following the Oghuz occupation of the region, though the characteristic features of the local Turkic language, such as Persian intonations and disregard of the vocalic harmony, were a remnant of the non-Turkic population.

Historical research suggests that the Old Azeri language, belonging to the Northwestern branch of the Iranian languages and believed to have descended from the language of the Medes, gradually gained currency and was widely spoken in said region for many centuries.

Some Azerbaijanis of the Republic of Azerbaijan are believed to be descended from the inhabitants of Caucasian Albania, an ancient country located in the eastern Caucasus region, and various Iranian peoples which settled the region. They claim there is evidence that, due to repeated invasions and migrations, the aboriginal Caucasian population may have gradually been culturally and linguistically assimilated, first by Iranian peoples, such as the Persians, and later by the Oghuz Turks. Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians, including their language, history, early conversion to Christianity, and relations with the Armenians and Georgians, under whose strong religious and cultural influence the Caucasian Albanians came in the coming centuries.

===Turkic origin and Turkification===
Turkification of the non-Turkic population derives from the Turkic settlements in the area now known as Azerbaijan, which began and accelerated during the Seljuk period. The migration of Oghuz Turks from present-day Turkmenistan, which is attested by linguistic similarity, remained high through the Mongol period, as many troops under the Ilkhanids were Turkic. By the Safavid period, the Turkic nature of Azerbaijan increased with the influence of the Qizilbash, an association of the Turkoman nomadic tribes that was the backbone of the Safavid Empire.

According to Soviet scholars, the Turkicization of Azerbaijan was largely completed during the Ilkhanid period. Faruk Sümer posits three periods in which Turkicization took place: Seljuk, Mongol and Post-Mongol (Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu and Safavid). In the first two, Oghuz Turkic tribes advanced or were driven to Anatolia and Arran. In the last period, the Turkic elements in Iran (Oghuz, with lesser admixtures of Uyghur, Qipchaq, Qarluq as well as Turkicized Mongols) were joined now by Anatolian Turks migrating back to Iran. This marked the final stage of Turkicization.

===Iranian origin===
10th-century Arab historian Al-Masudi attested the Old Azeri language and described that the region of Azerbaijan was inhabited by Persians. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism was prominent throughout the Caucasus before Christianity and Islam. According to Encyclopaedia Iranica, Azerbaijanis mainly originate from the earlier Iranian speakers, who still exist to this day in smaller numbers, and a massive migration of Oghuz Turks in the 11th and 12th centuries gradually Turkified Azerbaijan as well as Anatolia.

===Caucasian origin===

According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Azerbaijanis are of mixed descent, originating in the indigenous population of eastern Transcaucasia and possibly the Medians from northern Iran. There is evidence that, due to repeated invasions and migrations, aboriginal Caucasians may have been culturally assimilated, first by Ancient Iranian peoples and later by the Oghuz. Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians including their language, history, early conversion to Christianity. The Udi language, still spoken in Azerbaijan, may be a remnant of the Albanians&#x27; language.

===Genetics===

Contemporary Western Asian genomes, a region that includes Azerbaijan, have been greatly influenced by early agricultural populations in the area; later population movements, such as those of Turkic speakers, also contributed. However, as of 2017, there is no whole genome sequencing study for Azerbaijan; sampling limitations such as these prevent forming a &quot;finer-scale picture of the genetic history of the region&quot;.

A 2014 study comparing the genetics of the populations from Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, (which were grouped as &quot;Western Silk Road&quot;) Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan (grouped as &quot;Eastern Silk Road&quot;) found that the samples from Azerbaijan were the only group from the Western Silk Road to show significant contribution from the Eastern Silk Road, despite the overall clustering with the other samples from the Western Silk Road. The eastern input into the Azerbaijani genetics was estimated to be roughly 25 generations ago, corresponding to the time of the Mongolian expansion.

A 2002 study focusing on eleven Y-chromosome markers suggested that Azerbaijanis are genetically more related to their Caucasian geographic neighbors than to their linguistic neighbors. Iranian Azerbaijanis are genetically more similar to northern Azerbaijanis and the neighboring Turkic population than they are to geographically distant Turkmen populations. Iranian-speaking populations from Azerbaijan (the Talysh and Tats) are genetically closer to Azerbaijanis of the Republic than to other Iranian-speaking populations (Persian people and Kurds from Iran, Ossetians, and Tajiks). Several genetic studies suggested that the Azerbaijanis originate from a native population long resident in the area who adopted a Turkic language through language replacement, including possibility of elite dominance scenario. However, the language replacement in Azerbaijan (and in Turkey) might not have been in accordance with the elite dominance model, with estimated Central Asian contribution to Azerbaijan being 18% for females and 32% for males. A subsequent study also suggested 33% Central Asian contribution to Azerbaijan.

A 2001 study which looked into the first hypervariable segment of the MtDNA suggested that &quot;genetic relationships among Caucasus populations reflect geographical rather than linguistic relationships&quot;, with Armenians and Azerbaijanians being &quot;most closely related to their nearest geographical neighbours&quot;. Another 2004 study that looked into 910 MtDNAs from 23 populations in the Iranian plateau, the Indus Valley, and Central Asia suggested that populations &quot;west of the Indus basin, including those from Iran, Anatolia [Turkey] and the Caucasus, exhibit a common mtDNA lineage composition, consisting mainly of western Eurasian lineages, with a very limited contribution from South Asia and eastern Eurasia&quot;. While genetic analysis of mtDNA indicates that Caucasian populations are genetically closer to Europeans than to Near Easterners, Y-chromosome results indicate closer affinity to Near Eastern groups.

The range of haplogroups across the region may reflect historical genetic admixture, perhaps as a result of invasive male migrations.

In a comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azeris are more related to the people of Georgia, than they are to other Iranians, as well as to Armenians. However the same multidimensional scaling plot shows that Azeris from the Caucasus, despite their supposed common origin with Iranian Azeris, &quot;occupy an intermediate position between the Azeris/Georgians and Turks/Iranians grouping&quot;.

A 2007 study which looked into class two Human leukocyte antigen suggested that there were &quot;no close genetic relationship was observed between Azeris of Iran and the people of Turkey or Central Asians&quot;. A 2017 study which looked into HLA alleles put the samples from Azeris in Northwest Iran &quot;in the Mediterranean cluster close to Kurds, Gorgan, Chuvash (South Russia, towards North Caucasus), Iranians and Caucasus populations (Svan and Georgians)&quot;. This Mediterranean stock includes &quot;Turkish and Caucasian populations&quot;. Azeri samples were also in a &quot;position between Mediterranean and Central Asian&quot; samples, suggesting Turkification &quot;process caused by Oghuz Turkic tribes could also contribute to the genetic background of Azeri people&quot;. In a 2019 study examining genome-wide data from selected populations in North Africa and West Eurasia, Azeris were grouped with Balkars, Circassians, Georgians, Lezgins, and Turkish people.

==Demographics and society==

The vast majority of Azerbaijanis live in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan. Between 12 and 23 million Azerbaijanis live in Iran, mainly in the northwestern provinces. Approximately 9.1 million Azerbaijanis are found in the Republic of Azerbaijan. A diaspora of over a million is spread throughout the rest of the world. According to Ethnologue, there are over 1 million speakers of the northern Azerbaijani dialect in southern Dagestan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian proper, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. No Azerbaijanis were recorded in the 2001 census in Armenia, where the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resulted in population shifts. Other sources, such as national censuses, confirm the presence of Azerbaijanis throughout the other states of the former Soviet Union.

===In the Republic of Azerbaijan===

Azerbaijanis are by far the largest ethnic group in The Republic of Azerbaijan (over 90%), holding the second-largest community of ethnic Azerbaijanis after neighboring Iran. The literacy rate is very high, and is estimated at 99.5%. Azerbaijan began the twentieth century with institutions based upon those of Russia and the Soviet Union, with an official policy of atheism and strict state control over most aspects of society. Since independence, there is a secular system.

Azerbaijan has benefited from the oil industry, but high levels of corruption have prevented greater prosperity for the population. Despite these problems, there is a financial rebirth in Azerbaijan as positive economic predictions and an active political opposition appear determined to improve the lives of average Azerbaijanis.

===In Iran===

The exact number of Azerbaijanis in Iran is heavily disputed. Since the early twentieth century, successive Iranian governments have avoided publishing statistics on ethnic groups. Unofficial population estimates of Azerbaijanis in Iran are around the 16% area put forth by the CIA and Library of Congress. An independent poll in 2009 placed the figure at around 20–22%. According to the Iranologist Victoria Arakelova in peer-reviewed journal &quot;Iran and the Caucasus&quot;, estimating the number of Azeris in Iran has been hampered for years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the &quot;once invented theory of the so called separated nation (i.e. the citizens of the Azerbaijan Republic, the so-called Azerbaijanis, and the Azaris in Iran), was actualised again (see in detail Reza 1993)&quot;. Arakelova adds that the number of Azeris in Iran, featuring in the politically biased publications as &quot;Azerbaijani minority of Iran&quot;, is considered to be the &quot;highly speculative part of this theory&quot;. Even though all Iranian censuses of population distinguish exclusively religious minorities, numerous sources have presented different figures regarding Iran&#x27;s Turkic-speaking communities, without &quot;any justification or concrete references&quot;.

In the early 1990s, right after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the most popular figure depicting the number of &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; in Iran was thirty-three million, at a time when the entire population of Iran was barely sixty million. Therefore, at the time, half of Iran&#x27;s citizens were considered &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot;. Shortly after, this figure was replaced by thirty million, which became &quot;almost a normative account on the demographic situation in Iran, widely circulating not only among academics and political analysts, but also in the official circles of Russia and the West&quot;. Then, in the 2000s, the figure decreased to 20 million; this time, at least within the Russian political establishment, the figure became &quot;firmly fixed&quot;. This figure, Arakelova adds, has been widely used and kept up to date, only with a few minor adjustments. A cursory look at Iran&#x27;s demographic situation however, shows that all these figures have been manipulated and were &quot;definitely invented on political purpose&quot;. Arakelova estimates the number of Azeris i.e. &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; in Iran based on Iran&#x27;s population demographics at 6 to 6.5 million.

Azerbaijanis in Iran are mainly found in the northwest provinces: West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, parts of Hamadan, Qazvin, and Markazi. Azerbaijani minorities live in the Qorveh and Bijar counties of Kurdistan, in Gilan, as ethnic enclaves in Galugah in Mazandaran, around Lotfabad and Dargaz in Razavi Khorasan, and in the town of Gonbad-e Qabus in Golestan. Large Azerbaijani populations can also be found in central Iran (Tehran and Alborz) due to internal migration. Azerbaijanis make up 25% of Tehran&#x27;s population and 30.3% – 33% of the population of the Tehran Province, where Azerbaijanis are found in every city. They are the largest ethnic groups after Persians in Tehran and the Tehran Province. Arakelova notes that the widespread &quot;cliché&quot; among residents of Tehran on the number of Azerbaijanis in the city (&quot;half of Tehran consists of Azerbaijanis&quot;), cannot be taken &quot;seriously into consideration&quot;. Arakelova adds that the number of Tehran&#x27;s inhabitants who have migrated from northwestern areas of Iran, who are currently Persian-speakers &quot;for the most part&quot;, is not more than &quot;several hundred thousands&quot;, with the maximum being one million. Azerbaijanis have also emigrated and resettled in large numbers in Khorasan, especially in Mashhad.

Generally, Azerbaijanis in Iran were regarded as &quot;a well integrated linguistic minority&quot; by academics prior to Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolution. Despite friction, Azerbaijanis in Iran came to be well represented at all levels of &quot;political, military, and intellectual hierarchies, as well as the religious hierarchy&quot;.

Resentment came with Pahlavi policies that suppressed the use of the Azerbaijani language in local government, schools, and the press. However, with the advent of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, emphasis shifted away from nationalism as the new government highlighted religion as the main unifying factor. Islamic theocratic institutions dominate nearly all aspects of society. The Azerbaijani language and its literature are banned in Iranian schools. There are signs of civil unrest due to the policies of the Iranian government in Iranian Azerbaijan and increased interaction with fellow Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan and satellite broadcasts from Turkey and other Turkic countries have revived Azerbaijani nationalism. In May 2006, Iranian Azerbaijan witnessed riots over publication of a cartoon depicting a cockroach speaking Azerbaijani that many Azerbaijanis found offensive. The cartoon was drawn by Mana Neyestani, an Azeri, who was fired along with his editor as a result of the controversy. One of the major incidents that happened recently was Azeris protests in Iran (2015) started in November 2015, after children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Fitileha a&quot;ired on 6 November on state TV that ridiculed and mocked the accent and language of Azeris and included offensive jokes. As a result, ethnic Azeris protested a program on state TV that contained what they consider an ethnic slur. The head of the country&#x27;s state broadcaster Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) Mohammad Sarafraz has apologized for airing the program, whose broadcast was later discontinued.

Azerbaijanis are an intrinsic community of Iran, and their style of living closely resemble those of Persians:


There is significant cross-border trade between Azerbaijan and Iran, and Azerbaijanis from Azerbaijan go into Iran to buy goods that are cheaper, but the relationship was tense until recently. However, relations have significantly improved since the Rouhani administration took office.

===Subgroups===
There are at least ten Azerbaijani ethnic groups, each of which has particularities in the economy, culture, and everyday life. Some Azerbaijani ethnic groups continued in the last quarter of the 19th century.
Major Azerbaijani ethnic groups:
===Diaspora===
===Women===
In Azerbaijan, women were granted the right to vote in 1917. Women have attained Western-style equality in major cities such as Baku, although in rural areas more reactionary views remain. Violence against women, including rape, is rarely reported, especially in rural areas, not unlike other parts of the former Soviet Union. In Azerbaijan, the veil was abandoned during the Soviet period. Women are under-represented in elective office but have attained high positions in parliament. An Azerbaijani woman is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Azerbaijan, and two others are Justices of the Constitutional Court. In the 2010 election, women constituted 16% of all MPs (twenty seats in total) in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Abortion is available on demand in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The human rights ombudsman since 2002, Elmira Süleymanova, is a woman.

In Iran, a groundswell of grassroots movements have sought gender equality since the 1980s. Protests in defiance of government bans are dispersed through violence, as on 12 June 2006 when female demonstrators in Haft Tir Square in Tehran were beaten. Past Iranian leaders, such as the reformer ex-president Mohammad Khatami promised women greater rights, but the Guardian Council of Iran opposes changes that they interpret as contrary to Islamic doctrine. In the 2004 legislative elections, nine women were elected to parliament (Majlis), eight of whom were conservatives. The social fate of Azerbaijani women largely mirrors that of other women in Iran.

== Culture ==
===Language and literature===
The Azerbaijanis speak the Azerbaijani language, a Turkic language descended from the branches of Oghuz Turkic language that became established in Azerbaijan in the 11th and 12th centuries CE. The Azerbaijani language is closely related to Qashqai, Gagauz, Turkish, Turkmen and Crimean Tatar, sharing varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with each of those languages. Certain lexical and grammatical differences formed within the Azerbaijani language as spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran, after nearly two centuries of separation between the communities speaking the language; mutual intelligibility, however, has been preserved. Additionally, the Turkish and Azerbaijani languages are mutually intelligible to a high enough degree that their speakers can have simple conversations without prior knowledge of the other.

Early literature was mainly based on oral tradition, and the later compiled epics and heroic stories of Dede Korkut probably derive from it. The first written, classical Azerbaijani literature arose after the Mongol invasion, while the first accepted Oghuz Turkic text goes back to the 15th century. Some of the earliest Azerbaijani writings trace back to the poet Nasimi (died 1417) and then decades later Fuzûlî (1483–1556). Ismail I, Shah of Safavid Iran wrote Azerbaijani poetry under the pen name &quot;Khatâ&#x27;i&quot;.

Modern Azerbaijani literature continued with a traditional emphasis upon humanism, as conveyed in the writings of Samad Vurgun, Shahriar, and many others.

Azerbaijanis are generally bilingual, often fluent in either Russian (in Azerbaijan) or Persian (in Iran) in addition to their native Azerbaijani. As of 1996, around 38% of Azerbaijan&#x27;s roughly 8,000,000 population spoke Russian fluently. An independent telephone survey in Iran in 2009 reported that 20% of respondents could understand Azerbaijani, the most spoken minority language in Iran, and all respondents could understand Persian.

===Religion===
The majority of Azerbaijanis are Twelver Shi&#x27;a Muslims. Religious minorities include Sunni Muslims (mainly Shafi&#x27;i just like other Muslims in the surrounding North Caucasus), and Baháʼís. An unknown number of Azerbaijanis in the Republic of Azerbaijan have no religious affiliation. Many describe themselves as Shia Muslims. There is a small number of Naqshbandi Sufis among Muslim Azerbaijanis. Christian Azerbaijanis number around 5,000 people in the Republic of Azerbaijan and consist mostly of recent converts. Some Azerbaijanis from rural regions retain pre-Islamic animist or Zoroastrian-influenced beliefs, such as the sanctity of certain sites and the veneration of fire, certain trees and rocks. In Azerbaijan, traditions from other religions are often celebrated in addition to Islamic holidays, including Nowruz and Christmas.

===Performing arts===

In the group dance the performers come together in a semi-circular or circular formation as, &quot;The leader of these dances often executes special figures as well as signaling and changes in the foot patterns, movements, or direction in which the group is moving, often by gesturing with his or her hand, in which a kerchief is held.&quot;
Azerbaijani musical tradition can be traced back to singing bards called &quot;Ashiqs&quot;, a vocation that survives. Modern Ashiqs play the saz (lute) and sing &quot;dastans&quot; (historical ballads). Other musical instruments include the &quot;tar&quot; (another type of lute), &quot;balaban&quot; (a wind instrument), &quot;kamancha&quot; (fiddle), and the &quot;dhol&quot; (drums). Azerbaijani classical music, called &quot;mugham&quot;, is often an emotional singing performance. Composers Uzeyir Hajibeyov, Gara Garayev and Fikret Amirov created a hybrid style that combines Western classical music with &quot;mugham&quot;. Other Azerbaijanis, notably Vagif and Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, mixed jazz with &quot;mugham&quot;. Some Azerbaijani musicians have received international acclaim, including Rashid Behbudov (who could sing in over eight languages), Muslim Magomayev (a pop star from the Soviet era), Googoosh, and more recently Sami Yusuf.

After the 1979 revolution in Iran due to the clerical opposition to music in general, Azerbaijani music took a different course. According to Iranian singer Hossein Alizadeh, &quot;Historically in Iran, music faced strong opposition from the religious establishment, forcing it to go underground.&quot;

Some Azerbaijanis have been film-makers, such as Rustam Ibragimbekov, who wrote &quot;Burnt by the Sun&quot;, winner of the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1994.

===Sports===

Other ancient sports include wrestling, javelin throwing and fencing. The Soviet legacy has in modern times propelled some Azerbaijanis to become accomplished athletes at the Olympic level. The Azerbaijani government supports the country&#x27;s athletic legacy and encourages youth participation. Iranian athletes of Azerbaijani origin have particularly excelled in weight lifting, gymnastics, shooting, javelin throwing, karate, boxing, and wrestling. Weight lifters, such as Iran&#x27;s Hossein Reza Zadeh, world super heavyweight-lifting record holder and two-time Olympic champion in 2000 and 2004, or Hadi Saei, a former Iranian. Ramil Guliyev, an ethnic Azerbaijani who plays for Turkey, became the first world champion in athletics in the history of Turkey. Athletes such as Nizami Pashayev, who won the European heavyweight title in 2006, have excelled at the international level.

Taekwondo is also a sport in which Azerbaijani athletes showcase great results. It is one of the most popular sports in Azerbaijan, which attracts many Azerbaijani viewers every year. National Taekwondo Federation was founded in 1992, and every since produced many notable medal winners. Gashim Magomedov is among many Azerbaijani taekwondo practitioners. He won the silver medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris despite a reported injury in the finals match. Vice President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Mehriban Aliyeva congratulated the athlete on his win.

Chess is another popular pastime in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The country has produced many notable players, such as Teimour Radjabov, Vugar Gashimov and Shahriyar Mammadyarov, all three highly ranked internationally. Karate is also popular, where Rafael Aghayev achieved particular success, becoming a five-time world champion and eleven-time European champion.

<doc id="698457" wikidata="Q207738" url="?curid=698457" title="Aleksei Brusilov">
<text>Aleksei Alekseyevich Brusilov (, ; ; – 17 March 1926) was a Russian and later Soviet general most noted for the development of new offensive tactics used in the 1916 Brusilov offensive, which was his greatest achievement. 

Born into an aristocratic military family, Brusilov trained as a cavalry officer, but by 1914 had realized that cavalry was obsolete in an offensive capacity against modern weapons of warfare such as mass adoption of rifled guns, machine guns, and artillery. He is considered a very outstanding general who won many battles against the Austro-Hungarian army. His offensive in 1916 was the final major success of the Tsarist army. In the government, this offensive meant the transfer of the strategic initiative to the Russians and the beginning of preparations for the general offensive of 1917, which, however, was disrupted by the revolution.

Despite his noble status and prominent role in the Imperial Russian Army, he sided with the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and aided in the early organization of the Red Army until retiring in 1924.

Brusilov is one of the prominent Russian commanders in history, although not regarded as especially brilliant, he was pragmatic and open to change based on experience; his eponymous offensive succeeded in part from his willingness to properly train and prepare his troops, including in modern artillery and air reconnaissance.

==Early life==
Brusilov was born in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Georgia). His father Aleksi Nikolaevich Brusilov was Russian and his mother, Anna Luiza Niestojemska, was Polish. Three generations of Brusilovs had served as officers in the Imperial Russian Army, his grandfather fighting in the defense against Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1812. His father rose to the rank of Lieutenant General before dying of tuberculosis in 1856. Brusilov&#x27;s mother died shortly afterwards, and the young orphan was raised by relatives in Kutaisi.

He was educated at home until the age of 14. He joined the Imperial Corps of Pages in Saint Petersburg in 1867. At the end of his first year, a tutor remarked of Brusilov, &quot;his nature is brisk and even playful, but he is good, straightforward and clean-living. Of high ability, but inclined to be lazy.&quot;

In 1872, on completion of the Corps&#x27; programme, he sought admission to the advanced class for top ranking students, but was unsuccessful, and instead was posted as an ensign (Praporshchik) to the 15th (Tver) Dragoon Regiment. Usually, graduates from the Corps of Pages sought admission to one of the Guards regiments, but the Tver Dragoons were at that time stationed near Kutaisi, so the posting suited Brusilov on the basis of being near his family and being less financially draining than service in the Guards.

===Russo-Turkish War===
Brusilov joined the Tver Dragoons in August 1872 and was given command of a troop, but it was not long before his aptitude resulted in the appointment as regimental adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1874.

He served with distinction in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78, being mentioned in despatches on three occasions. His unit operated on the Southern Front in the Caucasus, and took part in the assault of the fortress of Ardagan (now Ardahan, Turkey), for which Brusilov was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislav, 3rd Class. Later in the war, he also received the Order of Saint Anne, 3rd Class, and was promoted to the rank of Stabskapitän. Towards the end of the war, he led successful attacks on Ottoman Army positions around Kars, and his membership of the Order of Saint Stanislav was elevated to 2nd Class.

===The Cavalry Officer School===
In 1881, Brusilov became a student at the Cavalry Officer School in Saint Petersburg and two years later was appointed as a riding instructor there. He spent the next thirteen years in a succession of posts at the school – Adjutant, Senior Teacher of Riding and Breaking Horses, Section Commander, Troop Commander, Squadron Commander and Assistant Chief of the School. On promotion to Major General in 1900, Brusilov was added to the list of Household Troops (officers who might be retained on official business by the tsar). During this time, Brusilov married (1884), and the union produced a son in 1887.

In 1902, as a Lieutenant General, he took command of the school, and under his leadership, the &quot;Horse Academy&quot; became an acknowledged centre of excellence in preparing staff officers for the cavalry. Brusilov published papers on the use of cavalry and visited France, Austria-Hungary and Germany to study riding tuition and stud management.

Brusilov was appointed to command the 2nd Guards Cavalry Division in 1906, but this was not a happy posting for him. The 1905 Russian Revolution had left St Petersburg in turmoil, and after his wife&#x27;s death, he sought a posting away from the Guards and the capital.

In 1908, he was appointed to command the 14th Army Corps in the Warsaw Military District, where his tenure was notable for the improvements in combat training he implemented. He also remarried at this time, to Nadejda (&quot;Hope&quot;) Jelihovski. Promoted to General of Cavalry in 1912, he became Deputy Commander-in-Chief of forces in the Warsaw Military District. The failures of the Russo-Japanese War had led to allegations that generals from immigrant families, who made a significant fraction of the Russian Army&#x27;s senior ranks, were less patriotic than those who traced their origins to within Russia&#x27;s borders, and Brusilov would come into conflict with the Governor-General in Warsaw, Georgi Skalon, and other &quot;Russian-German&quot; generals in that District. Brusilov was soon seeking another post.

In 1913, Brusilov was posted to command the 12th Army Corps in the Kiev Military District, remarking on his departure, &quot;I do not doubt, that my departure will produce a sensation in the troops of Warsaw region... Well! What&#x27;s done is done, and I am glad, that I have escaped cesspool of Skalon&#x27;s court atmosphere.&quot;

==First World War==

===1914–1915===
In July 1914, with the Russian army expanding during mobilisation, Brusilov was promoted to command the 8th Army, part of the Southwest Front operating in Galicia. The 8th Army crushed the Austro-Hungarian Third Army before it, and rapidly advanced nearly . Reverses elsewhere along the Front, including the great defeat at Tannenberg, forced the 8th Army to retreat in conformity with the general Russian withdrawal. For his victories, Brusilov was awarded the Order of Saint George 4th, and then 3rd Class. By a quirk of fate, several future White Army commanders held senior posts in 8th Army at this time—Brusilov&#x27;s Quartermaster general was Anton Denikin, while Alexey Kaledin commanded the 12th Cavalry Division and Lavr Kornilov was in command of 48th Infantry Division.
At the beginning of the siege of Przemysl, he left alone with a superior enemy on the left bank of the San River, repelled the offensive. The twice-strong enemy was killed by Brusilov&#x27;s army, but the Austro-Hungarians managed to break the right sector of the front. Brusilov&#x27;s skill helped him get out and he eliminated the breakthrough, blocked enemy troops in the forests, where they were thrown back, and the breakthrough was localized. His troops in such a situation withstood the fighting to the end and saved the Russian army from disaster.
After Brusilov&#x27;s troops drove the Austrians back from the San River, securing Przemysl, he began to drive the enemy straight to the Carpathian valley, where he faced fierce resistance from an enemy stronger in numbers than he was. In November, his troops were poorly supplied with winter clothing, but continued to maintain the initiative. Brusilov asked several times to speed up the dispatch of things to him, but this was delayed because the government considered it necessary to supply the northwestern front faster. Brusilov then used his personal funds to buy things and shoes in order to help his troops. High Command also asked Brusilov to finish off the enemy as soon as possible in order to help the 3rd army take Krakow, however, due to the smaller number and fewer artillery, Brusilov rejected this adventure. To this was added the absence of a clear plan for the campaign after the Battle of Galicia and the siege of Przemysl. Tasks of the front changed based on the situation.&lt;br&gt;In mid-November, taking well-fortified positions of the Germans and Austrians one after another with heavy fighting, Brusilov was still able to drive them to the southern Carpathians, finally consolidating his positions, while taking many prisoners and equipment. The most stubborn battles were fought near the town of Mezo-Labotsa, where the main burden fell on General Orlov.

However, the Germans did not stop, in the middle of 1915 they made a general attempt to break through Brusilov&#x27;s front and liberate Przemysl, Brusilov knew about this and skillfully parried the attacks of the enemy three times superior, the Germans realized that this adventure would not be crowned with success, and abandoned attempts to liberate Przemysl. A few days later, the Russians finally took the fortress.

===Great Retreat===
Once again, fortunes on other fronts would determine his actions, and the Central Powers breakthrough at Gorlice-Tarnów forced Brusilov to withdraw as part of the general retreat. By September, the 8th Army had withdrawn to the Tarnopol region. However, Brusilov&#x27;s victories cast doubt on Austria-Hungary&#x27;s ability to defend itself against Russian offensives and forced its senior military ally the German Empire to divert forces from the Western Front to assist it.
On the Southern Bug, Brusilov stopped for about a month, preventing the central powers from advancing. This allowed the defeated 3rd Army to recover from the defeat and replenish its supply. After that, he continued his planned retreat without leaving any trophies to the enemy. Brusilov constantly organized successful local counterattacks against the enemies, slowing down the offensive. At the end of the great retreat, in order to raise the morale of the army, he attempted to defeat the 14th German division, which was crowned with success. He took part in the Lutsk operation. 

In October 1915, Brusilov wanted to deport 20,000 German civilians from Volhynia. With Stavka Chief of Staff General Mikhail Alekseyev&#x27;s permission, Brusilov carried out the operation.

===Brusilov offensive===

On 29 March 1916, Brusilov was given command of the Southwest Front and managed to secure a certain degree of freedom of action. Previous Russian offensives demonstrated a tendency to assault smaller and smaller sections of the front with increasing density of artillery and manpower to achieve a breakthrough. The narrow frontage of these attacks made counterattacks straightforward for German forces, and this approach met with repeated failure for the Russians.

Brusilov decided to distribute his attack over the entirety of Southwest Front. He hoped to disorganise the enemy over such a large area that some point would fatally give way. He decided not to waste resources by saturation bombardment of worthless areas, but to use interdiction fire against command posts, road networks, and other critically important targets to degrade German command and control over the whole front. The noted German artillery commander, Georg Bruchmüller, having served opposite Brusilov&#x27;s Front at this time, would learn from and adapt these tactics when planning the preparatory bombardment for Operation Michael on the Western Front in 1918. Brusilov was not even concerned with securing a tremendous local advantage in manpower, permitting divisions under his command to be transferred to other Fronts (so long as they attacked in support of his offensive).
Brusilov&#x27;s new techniques were, by First World War standards, highly successful and over the next 3 months, Southwest Front advanced an average of more than 30 kilometres along a front of more than , taking 450,000 Austro-Hungarian prisoners in the process. However, the planned supporting attack from West Front (the Army group to Brusilov&#x27;s north) was not delivered, and Germany was able to transfer 17 divisions from France and Belgium to halt the Russian advance.

Brusilov was awarded the Sword of Saint George with Diamonds for his greatest victory, one of only 8 Russian commanders to receive this award during the First World War.

From 27 June to 3 July 1916, Brusilov carried out, on his own initiative, the deportation of 13,000 German civilians from the Volhynian areas that had been conquered during the offensive.

===1917 and Revolution===

Brusilov was sure that after the failure of 1905 the revolutionaries will try to take revenge, Brusilov thought that in peacetime he would support the people, but during the greatest war in history he considered it unnecessary to weaken the situation and the army. Alekseev telegraphed Brusilov that if he did not send a telegram to the tsar asking him to abdicate, then all supplies of equipment would be closed to him, which is equivalent to killing his troops. Brusilov reluctantly agreed, later regretting his action.

On 4 June [O.S. 22 May] 1917, Brusilov was appointed Commander in Chief of the Russian Army.

Throughout this period, Brusilov proved sympathetic to revolutionary aspirations, though his primary concern was that the war needed to be won first. In particular, he asserted that until peace was achieved, the full authority of the central government must be respected and that the army should maintain the full rigour of its disciplinary code. In a telegram to the Minister of War, Alexander Kerensky, he wrote, &quot;... only the application of capital punishment will stop the decomposition of army and will save freedom and our homeland&quot;.

Brusilov tried to do everything to stop the disintegration of the army, he ordered the killing of Bolsheviks at the front and in the rear in order to stop the propaganda of peace. He actively supported the shock troops who fulfilled the purpose of the overseers destroying all revolutionary contagion.

This unpopular stand, together with the failure of the Kerensky Offensive in July 1917, led to Brusilov&#x27;s replacement as Commander in Chief by his former deputy, Lavr Kornilov. Brusilov moved to Moscow and remained there at the disposal of the Russian Provisional Government. He gave an excellent praising to Tomáš Masaryk for Czechoslovak Legion soldiers after Battle of Zborov in July 1917. When fighting broke out in Moscow following the October Revolution, he was severely wounded in the foot by a fragment of a shell that hit his bathroom.

== Soviet Russia ==
Because some of his former soldiers were serving in the newly formed Red Army, Brusilov concurred that radical change was necessary. Brusilov saw cooperation with the Soviet state as a way to hold the territory of the former Russian Empire together in the interests of the Russian nation. Privately, he expressed the hope that the communist system would pass and be replaced by a Russian nation-state. He accused exiled White emigrants and the White movement overall of putting their class interests above the interests of the Russian nation.

On 30 May 1920, during the Polish Eastern offensive of the Polish-Soviet War, he published in Pravda an appeal entitled &quot;To All Former Officers, Wherever They Might Be,&quot; encouraging anti-Bolshevik Russians to forgive past grievances and join the Red Army. Brusilov considered it a patriotic duty for all Russian officers to join hands with the Bolshevik government, which in his opinion was defending Russia against foreign invaders. On 12 September 1920, Mikhail Kalinin, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Sergey Kamenev and Brusilov signed an appeal, &quot;To all officers of the army of Baron Wrangel,&quot; in which they called on White Army officers to go over to the side of the Russian Soviet Republic. In the document, they accused Wrangel of acting in the interests of the Polish nobility and the Anglo-French capitalists, who they believed had used the Wrangel army to enslave the Russian people (as had happened with the Czechoslovak corps and the &quot;black-skinned divisions&quot;). 

Initially, Brusilov served on a special commission to determine the size and structure of the Red Army. Later, he led cavalry recruit training and became Inspector of Cavalry. He retired in 1924 but continued to carry out commissions for the Revolutionary Military Council.

Aged seventy upon his retirement, he lived in his shared apartment with his sickly wife and another couple. He died in Moscow from congestive heart failure, and was given an honourable state funeral, buried in the Novodevichy Convent, by representatives from the &#x27;new Russia&#x27; (the Bolsheviks), and the &#x27;old Russia&#x27; (the clergy, the middle and upper class). His second wife Nadezhda Brusilova-Zhelikhova (1864–1938) is buried in the Orthodox section of the Olšany Cemetery in Prague, along with a number of other members of the Russian emigration.

== Legacy ==

His war memoirs were translated into English and published in 1930 as &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Notebook, 1914–1918.&quot; Following the October Revolution, he served the Bolsheviks and joined the Red Army. Many pro-tsarist historians avoided praising or even mentioning his historical role, because of his role in the Red Army. Denikin, for example, a participant in the 1916 offensive and later a leading White commander, portrayed Brusilov as a ditherer who, at a critical moment in the 1916 offensive, &quot;suffered a curious psychological breakdown&quot; and ordered a needless retreat spurred by &quot;imaginary dangers of the enemy breaking through.&quot;

The Soviet government also notes Brusilov&#x27;s extreme counterrevolutionary views:
Brusilov can also be described as an ardent Germanophobe, which is confirmed by the entries in his memoirs and actions in Galicia:

==Assessment==
According to the assessment of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Brusilov was one of the seven outstanding fighting commanders of World War I, the others being Erich von Falkenhayn (later replaced by Paul von Hindenburg), Erich Ludendorff, Mustafa Kemal, Herbert Plumer, John Monash and Edmund Allenby.

<text>Fudbalski klub Smederevo 1924 (), commonly known as Smederevo, is a Serbian professional football club based in Smederevo.

At the beginning of the 2000s, the club (then known as Sartid Smederevo) became one of the most successful clubs in the country and took part in European competitions in five consecutive seasons, with some memorable matches against the likes of TSV 1860 Munich and Ipswich Town. The club achieved its greatest success by defeating Red Star Belgrade 1–0 in the 2002–03 Serbia and Montenegro Cup final.

==History==
Acting on suggestion from chief engineer Ernest Radlinski, the club was first founded on 6 May 1924 by SARTID (&quot;Srpsko akcionarsko rudarsko topioničarsko industrijsko društvo&quot;) as FK Sartid. At the beginning, FK Sartid&#x27;s roster was mostly filled with professional players from Hungary, Austria and Germany and the club failed to make much noise in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s football scene. Then in 1944, it was essentially disbanded by Yugoslavia&#x27;s new communist authorities following the end of World War II, along with the entire Sartid factory whose property was nationalized.

Though it is not certain if what followed can be viewed in continuity with FK Sartid, many fans consider it to be a part of club&#x27;s history, so depending on one&#x27;s opinion, either a new club appeared or the name was simply changed to FK Metalac in 1944.

The following period was marked by numerous name changes. Two years later in 1946 the name was switched to FK Jedinstvo, and it lasted only three years until 1949 when it was changed to FK Smederevo.

In 1958, FK Smederevo merged with FK Metalac to form OFK Budućnost, the name that stuck around until 1962 when it was switched back to FK Smederevo. That setup lasted until 1967, when the club became FK Metalurg.

In 1976, the name was switched to FK Smederevo for the third time, lasting until the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1992.

All throughout this 48-year period, the club toiled in lower leagues (Serbian regional league, etc.).

FK Sartid was reborn in 1992 when Sartid metallurgical concern took over the club&#x27;s ownership and sponsorship, and promptly switched to its original name. The renaissance commenced immediately as the club went from Smederevo Zone League to Yugoslav First League in six seasons. The 1998–99 campaign will go down in history as the club&#x27;s first in top flight. The club&#x27;s success in this period was tied to their main board president Dušan Matković. In addition to his position at FK Sartid, Matković was also a high-ranking official of Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s party SPS as well as Minister of Industry in the government of Mirko Marjanović. The allegations that the club was involved in various illegal and irregular activities, and also protected from persecution because of their powerful benefactor, during this period are numerous.

After losing the national cup final to Crvena Zvezda in 2002, the club won the competition against the same opponent in 2003. In the summer of 2004, the club changed its name back to FK Smederevo.

The most noted player is former team captain Goran Bogdanović. He retired after the 2003–04 season.

In summer 2014, FK Smederevo merged with FK Seljak from Mihajlovac to form FK Semendrija 1924. In January 2015, the club changed its name to FK Smederevo 1924. They finished 7th in the 2014–15 Serbian League West.

In the 2018–19 season FK Smederevo 1924 finished first in the Serbian League West and were promoted to the Serbian First League.

In the 2022–23 season FK Smederevo 1924 won the Serbian League West and were promoted to the Serbian First League again.

=== Names of the club through history ===
==European seasons==

===2001–02===
The trio of Nenad Mirosavljević (15 league goals), Vladimir Mudrinić (earned a mid-season move to Zenit Saint Petersburg) and Goran Bogdanović led the way on pitch during 2001–02 campaign that, among other things, will be remembered for the absence of now customary mid-season Sartid coaching changes. Head coach Jovica Škoro confidently guided his team to a 3rd place league finish and a Yugoslav Cup final where they were unlucky to lose to the more experienced Red Star side.

On the European front, Sartid competed in UEFA Intertoto Cup where they recorded a memorable first round win versus Dundee (0–0 away, 5–2 at home before 16,000 fans). Unfortunately, the journey ended in second round versus an experienced TSV 1860 München side featuring veterans Thomas Häßler and Vidar Riseth (1–3 away, 2–3 at home).

===2002–03===
The year that started off in high style almost turned sour towards the end with a string of poor results that sent the team spiraling down the table. Management reacted quickly, sacking coach Škoro in April, and bringing in Milenko Kiković for his second stint with the club. The move paid immediate dividends and relegation was avoided comfortably. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough cause for celebration, Sartid managed to beat Crvena Zvezda 1–0 in Serbia and Montenegro Cup final at Partizan Stadium, achieving the club&#x27;s greatest success in history.

Similarly to Sartid&#x27;s domestic campaign, the year in Europe started off glowingly. They quickly disposed of Welsh side Bangor City to reach the UEFA Cup first round where Ipswich Town was waiting. The hopes were further raised following a favourable away result 1–1, meaning they just needed to keep a clean sheet at home to progress. However, the combination of Marcus Bent converting an early 9th-minute penalty and Sartid failing to score for the remainder of the match spelled painful elimination.

===2003–04===
The 2003–04 campaign was another fairly stable season in top league result wise. Though as usual not on the coaching front. New head coach Ratko Dostanić, brought in before the season, started off tremendously. In UEFA Cup, he led the squad to a memorable win in a tie against Sarajevo. With Dostanić firmly in charge, Sartid&#x27;s form continued in the domestic league, too. At the midway point of the season Sartid was sitting in third place, just behind Belgrade powerhouses Crvena Zvezda and Partizan. During the winter break, Dostanić wanted the team captain Goran Bogdanović promoted to the role of technical director, but new club president Thomas Kelly would have none of it so Dostanić decided to leave. In January 2004, Zvonko Varga was appointed as a new coach, but he left the club after only few matches. Afterwards, old face Milenko Kiković was brought back to coach and he managed to complete a successful season for the club.

===2004–05===
The following 2004–05 season was not nearly as happy. It started off alright with demolition of lowly Andorran side Sant Julià in Intertoto Cup first round, but the painful next round exit at the hands of Dinamo Minsk turned out to be ominous. All throughout the domestic campaign Smederevo battled relegation threat. During the winter break coach Kiković resigned leaving the team in 10th place with 17 points. New head coach Tomislav Sivić managed to narrowly keep the club in top flight.

===2005–06===
The 2005–06 season has been another difficult one for the club. The embarrassing Intertoto Cup first round exit to Prilep&#x27;s Pobeda was a sign of things to come. After managing only 13 points from 11 league matches, head coach Tomislav Sivić resigned on 1 November 2005 in the wake of the team&#x27;s third straight league loss. Following a period under a caretaker, club appointed Spaniard Jaume Bauzà on 28 November 2005. Though the team&#x27;s overall play somewhat improved, it was enough to avoid relegation at the end of the season.

<doc id="698467" wikidata="Q524369" url="?curid=698467" title="Steve Wynn">
<text>Stephen Alan Wynn ( Weinberg; born January 27, 1942) is an American real estate developer and art collector. He was known for his involvement in the luxury casino and hotel industry, prior to being forced to step down. Early in his career he oversaw the construction and operation of several notable Las Vegas and Atlantic City hotels, including the Golden Nugget, the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, The Mirage, Treasure Island, the Bellagio, and Beau Rivage in Mississippi, and he played a pivotal role in the resurgence and expansion of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1990s. In 2000, Wynn sold his company, Mirage Resorts, to MGM Grand Inc., resulting in the formation of MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International). Wynn later took his company Wynn Resorts public in an initial public offering and was Wynn Resorts&#x27; CEO and Chairman of the Board until February 6, 2018, when he announced his resignation. He is a prominent donor to the Republican Party and was the finance chair of the Republican National Committee from January 2017 to January 2018, when he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations.

Through Wynn Resorts, he has overseen the construction and development of several luxury resorts, opening Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, Wynn Macau in 2006, Encore Las Vegas in 2008, Encore at Wynn Macau in 2010 and Wynn Palace in Macau in 2016, and Wynn Everett near Boston which opened in June 2019 under the name Encore Boston Harbor. In 2006, Wynn was inducted into the American Gaming Association Hall of Fame. As of September 2015, Wynn&#x27;s net worth was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $2.4 billion, making him the 279th wealthiest American. Steve Wynn collects fine art, including pieces by artists such as Picasso and Claude Monet.

On February 6, 2018, Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts amid accusations of sexual misconduct including harassment, assault, and coercion. Wynn has denied the allegations.

==Early life and education==
Steve Wynn was born Stephen Alan Weinberg on January 27, 1942 in New Haven, Connecticut to a Jewish family. His father, Michael, owned a chain of bingo parlors in the eastern United States. His mother Zelma (née Kutner), was from Maine. Wynn’s father changed the family&#x27;s last name in 1946 from &quot;Weinberg&quot; to &quot;Wynn&quot; when Steve was 4 years old &quot;to avoid anti-Jewish discrimination&quot;. Wynn was raised in Utica, New York, and graduated from The Manlius School, a private boys&#x27; school east of Syracuse, New York, in 1959.

After high school, Wynn studied English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. Wynn graduated in 1963 with a Bachelor of Arts. Shortly before graduation, his father died during heart surgery, leaving $350,000 in gambling debts. Wynn, who had been accepted into Yale Law School, relinquished his admission and instead took over his family&#x27;s bingo parlor in Waysons Corner, Maryland.

==Career==
===Frontier and the Golden Nugget (1967–1989)===

In 1967, Wynn and his family moved to Las Vegas where he purchased a small stake in the Frontier Hotel and Casino. That year he met E. Parry Thomas, the president of the Bank of Las Vegas, which was the only bank at the time willing to extend loans to Las Vegas casinos, and Thomas helped finance several of Wynn&#x27;s early land deals. Starting in 1968, Wynn also spent four years operating a wine and liquor importing company he had purchased.

In 1971, Wynn bought a controlling interest in the Golden Nugget Las Vegas, one of the oldest casinos in the city. His company stake increased so that, in 1973, he became the majority shareholder, and the youngest casino owner in Las Vegas. In 1977 he opened the Golden Nugget&#x27;s first hotel tower, followed by several others. Frank Sinatra was a periodic headliner at the Golden Nugget, and Wynn has since maintained a relationship with the Sinatra family, even naming a restaurant at Encore &quot;Sinatra&quot;.

In 1980, Wynn began construction on the Golden Nugget Atlantic City in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It was Atlantic City&#x27;s first and only &quot;locals casino&quot; and the city&#x27;s sixth casino after the city legalized gambling in 1976. Joel Bergman, who designed Wynn&#x27;s other resorts, designed the Golden Nugget. Though at its opening it was the second smallest casino in the city, by 1983 it was the city&#x27;s top earning casino. Wynn sold the Atlantic City Golden Nugget in 1987 for $440 million.

===The Mirage and Treasure Island (1989–1997)===
Wynn&#x27;s first major casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, which opened on November 22, 1989. It was the first time Wynn was involved with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games. The hotel became the main venue for the &quot;Siegfried &amp; Roy&quot; show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show &quot;Nouvelle Expérience&quot;.

Wynn&#x27;s next project, Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, opened in the Mirage&#x27;s old parking lot on October 27, 1993, at an overall cost of $450 million. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.

In 1995, Wynn&#x27;s company proposed to build the Le Jardin hotel-casino in the marina area if the state of New Jersey built a road that connected to the hotel-casino. The company had also agreed to allow Circus Circus Enterprises and Boyd Gaming to build casinos on the site, but later reneged on the agreement. While the road, called the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, was eventually built, Le Jardin was cancelled after the company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which later built the Borgata, in a joint venture with Boyd Gaming, on the site.

===Bellagio and Beau Rivage debuts (1998–1999)===
On October 15, 1998, Wynn opened the even more opulent Bellagio, a $1.6 billion resort considered among the world&#x27;s most spectacular hotels. The architect was Jon Jerde of The Jerde Partnerships, and construction was undertaken by Wynn&#x27;s company Mirage Resorts, Inc. When built, the Bellagio was the most expensive hotel in the world. In front of the hotel are the Fountains of Bellagio—shooting fountains choreographed to music that &quot;dance&quot; on the hotel&#x27;s 8.5-acre man-made lake—which are now considered Las Vegas landmarks. The Bellagio is credited with starting a new spree of luxurious developments in Las Vegas. Among these developments include The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and Paris Las Vegas.

Wynn brought Mirage Resorts&#x27; style to Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1999, where he oversaw development of the 1,835-room Beau Rivage. Themed to blend Mediterranean beauty with Southern hospitality, the resort was part of a building boom that established Biloxi as a regional tourism center along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. &quot;Beau Rivage&quot; was originally the name Wynn wanted to give the Bellagio, though he had decided on &quot;Bellagio&quot; after vacationing in the Italian region of the same name. Beau Rivage opened as the largest hotel-casino to be built outside Nevada. The casino was initially located on a series of floating barges, as local law confined all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time. The hotel, restaurants, and associated facilities were constructed on land.

===Wynn Las Vegas and Macau (2000–2007)===
Mirage Resorts was sold to MGM Grand Inc. for $6.6 billion ($21 per share) in June 2000 to form MGM Mirage. Five weeks before the deal was closed (April 27, 2000) Wynn purchased the Desert Inn for $270 million. He closed the Inn later that year.

Wynn took Wynn Resorts Limited public in 2002. Wynn became a billionaire in 2004, when his net worth doubled to $1.3 billion. On April 28, 2005, he opened his most expensive resort at the time, the Wynn Las Vegas, on the site of the former Desert Inn. Built at a cost of $2.7 billion, it was the largest privately funded construction project in the nation as of 2005.

Wynn successfully bid for one of three gaming concessions opened for tender in Macau. This property, known as Wynn Macau, opened on September 5, 2006.

===Encore hotels and other projects (2008–2018)===

In the summer of 2008, hiring began for Encore Las Vegas, the newest in Wynn&#x27;s collection of resorts. The tower of Encore is modeled after the Wynn Las Vegas tower, and they share the same &quot;property&quot; though they are separate hotels. After having started construction in 2006, the overall cost of the project equaled $2.3 billion. Encore opened on December 22, 2008. As of December 31, 2012, Wynn and Encore Las Vegas employed approximately 9,000 full-time employees. Encore at Wynn Macau, an expansion of Wynn Macau similar to the expansion of the Las Vegas property, opened on April 21, 2010.

In 2016, Wynn opened the Wynn Palace in Cotai, Macao, PRC. It was previously approved by the Macau government in 2012.

In September 2014, Wynn was awarded the license to build the Wynn Boston Harbor casino in the eastern Massachusetts city of Everett, near downtown Boston.

In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that dozens of people recounted a pattern of sexual misconduct by Wynn, including several former employees. On February 6, 2018, Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts, though he denied all allegations.

==Political activities==
In the past, Wynn has financially supported both the Democratic and the Republican Party, for example contributing $200,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2013. In 2011 he spoke in support of Nevada Senator Harry Reid. Though he supported Barack Obama in the 2008 election, in 2011 he expressed disappointment with Obama&#x27;s policies relating to economic issues.

In December 2010, Prince Albert II of Monaco bestowed Monegasque citizenship to Wynn, an unusual act since Wynn did not meet the prerequisites. According to the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, Wynn was given citizenship when he agreed to be an outside director in Monaco QD International Hotels and Resorts Management, which is a joint venture between the governments of Monaco and Qatar. The organization buys and manages hotels in Europe, the Middle East and North America.

Between 2012 and 2018, Wynn contributed more than $2.5 million to the Republican Governors Association and also donated $411,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, $248,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $100,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee. In 2016, Wynn donated $833,000 to Republican Party joint fundraising committees. After Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Wynn was named a vice-chairman of Trump&#x27;s inauguration committee.

After the January 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump, Wynn was named finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. In October 2017 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Wynn, who has financial interests in China, lobbied President Trump on behalf of the Chinese government to return a Chinese dissident, Guo Wengui, to China. On January 28, 2018, Wynn resigned from the finance chairman position amid sexual misconduct allegations. In May 2021, the Department of Justice ordered Wynn to register as a foreign agent of China, and filed a civil lawsuit. He denied acting as a foreign agent and lobbying on China&#x27;s behalf. The case was dismissed in October 2022. The court did not determine whether Wynn actually acted as a foreign agent but ruled that he could not be retroactively compelled to register after his alleged relationship with the Chinese government had ended.

Together with his spouse, Wynn contributed $1.5million to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

==Art collection==

Wynn is known for amassing a large collection of fine art, often placing the pieces in his various casinos and hotels. In 2004, Wynn purchased Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals&quot; at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $30 million. With the purchase, he became the first art collector to purchase a Vermeer painting in over 80 years. Wynn later sold the painting to the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan for the same price.

In 2006, Wynn acquired J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s &quot;Giudecca, La Donna Della Salute and San Giorgio&quot; for $35.8 million via an anonymous telephone auction. Although Wynn did not officially identify himself as the buyer, his identity was confirmed by two people acquainted with the transaction. Wynn purchased the painting from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a White Plains-based nonprofit organization that supports Capuchin priests on their missionary trips.

Steve Wynn&#x27;s private art collection with specific commentary about his paintings by Claude Monet are highlighted in the 2008 film &quot;Monet&#x27;s Palate&quot; with Meryl Streep and distributed by American Public Television. Many of the collection&#x27;s pieces were on display at the Bellagio. The collection was on display at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno while the Wynn Las Vegas was being constructed and was installed in the resort shortly before it was opened. The Wynn Las Vegas gallery, which had charged an entrance fee, closed shortly after the start of 2006. The artwork from the former gallery was then scattered around the resort.

In 2009, he spent $33.2 million on Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Man with His Arms Akimbo&quot;, the auction record for the artist.

Under the direction of Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts acquired Jeff Koons&#x27;s &quot;Tulips&quot; at auction in November 2012 for approximately $33.6 million. In May 2014, Wynn acquired &quot;Popeye&quot; from the same artist for over $28.165 million, putting the work on display at Wynn Las Vegas.

In February 2020, Wynn bought two Picasso paintings from Donald Marron&#x27;s collection for $105 million: &quot;Woman with Beret and Collar&quot; and &quot;Jacqueline&quot;.

===&quot;Le Rêve&quot;===
&quot;Le Rêve&quot; is the Picasso portrait that was the working name of Wynn&#x27;s resort project. Wynn purchased the painting from an anonymous collector in a private sale in 2001. In 2006, he reportedly was to sell it to Steven A. Cohen for $139 million, which would at that time have been the highest price paid for any piece of art. However, Wynn put his elbow through the canvas while showing it to a group of guests.

This canceled the sale, and after a $90,000 repair, the painting was estimated to be worth $85 million. Wynn sued his insurance company over the $54 million difference with the virtual selling price. The case was settled out of court in April 2007.

In 2013, Wynn sold &quot;Le Rêve&quot; to Steven A. Cohen for $155 million.
==Personal life==
Wynn married Elaine Farrell Pascal in 1963. They divorced in 1986, remarried in 1991, and divorced again in 2010. Elaine Wynn was a director of the company&#x27;s board for 13 years, ending in 2015. They have two daughters, Kevyn and Gillian. Kevyn was kidnapped in 1993 and Wynn paid $1.45 million in ransom for her safe return. The kidnappers were apprehended when one attempted to buy a Ferrari in Newport Beach, California, with cash. Kevyn was found unharmed several hours later.

On April 30, 2011, Wynn married Andrea Danenza Hissom in a ceremony at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Wynn suffers from the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa, which he was diagnosed with in 1971. In 2010, Wynn switched to a vegan diet after watching the documentary &quot;Eating&quot; by Mike Anderson.

==Accolades==
In May 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Wynn as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People&quot;. Wynn was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by President George W. Bush on October 30, 2006. In November 2006, Wynn was inducted into the American Gaming Association Hall of Fame. He has also received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Sierra Nevada College; The Culinary Institute of America; and Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named him a &quot;Captain of Capitalism&quot; in 2007. Wynn was named to &quot;Institutional Investor&#x27;s&quot; Best CEOs list in the All-America Executive Team Survey from 2008 through 2011.

In March 2011, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; named Steve Wynn one of the 30 &quot;World&#x27;s Best CEOs.&quot;

In November 2014, Wynn ranked 17th on &quot;Harvard Business Review&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 best-performing CEOs in the world.

He also received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006, which was rescinded following Wynn&#x27;s sexual misconduct allegations in 2018.

==Legal issues==

In 1991, Dennis Gomes, president of Wynn&#x27;s Golden Nugget, left his position to join Donald Trump&#x27;s Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, receiving a $1 million bonus in lieu of equity. Wynn filed suit against Trump and Gomes for breach of contract, as Gomes was contracted to work at the Nugget until 1992. Gomes settled in 1994. Also in 1991, Gomes alleged in a countersuit that Wynn used harsh language against Gomes, but Wynn&#x27;s representatives denied the allegations.

In 1997, Wynn sued Barricade Books for defamation over the catalog description of an unauthorized biography &quot;Running Scared&quot; by John L. Smith. Wynn was initially awarded $3.2 million, forcing Barricade into bankruptcy. In 2001 the ruling was thrown out by the Supreme Court of Nevada. A retrial was scheduled for 2004. The issue was settled between Wynn and New York publisher Lyle Stuart in a confidential agreement, and the case dismissed.

In a legal battle over an attempt by Wynn-controlled Mirage to build a casino in Atlantic City, Donald Trump claimed in a lawsuit that Wynn used a private investigator as a double agent to secretly record conversations with Trump. The investigator, Louis Rodriguez, a former Los Angeles police officer and investigator for the IRS, claimed he had a change of heart because he felt that Trump used his efforts &quot;in an immoral and unethical manner to cause financial harm&quot; to Wynn and Mirage and thus turned &quot;whistleblower.&quot; Wynn settled the lawsuit in 2000 and befriended Trump, who attended Wynn&#x27;s wedding in 2011.

Beginning in 2008, Wynn engaged in a dispute with &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; producer Joe Francis. In 2011, a Nevada district attorney prosecuted Francis for writing a bad check to cover a $2 million gambling debt owed to Wynn, but the judge dismissed the case for falling outside the six-month statute of limitations. Wynn collected the debt in a separate civil case. In response to the collection, Francis stated that Wynn threatened to kill him, prompting Wynn to file suit for defamation against Francis. In February 2012, Clark County, Nevada, judge Mark Denton ruled that Francis damaged the reputation of Wynn and awarded Wynn $7.5 million in damages. In September 2012, after Francis repeated the alleged threat on television and Wynn added a second defamation claim, a jury awarded Wynn $40 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The judgment was amended to $19 million, after Wynn failed to prove that Francis could pay the original amount.

In January 2012, Wynn&#x27;s former business partner Kazuo Okada filed suit to gain access to company documents related to Wynn&#x27;s pledge to donate $135 million to the University of Macau Development Foundation. Wynn later accused Okada&#x27;s company, Aruze, of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, leading to a Department of Justice probe into Aruze&#x27;s gifts of hotel rooms and other expenses to Philippine, South Korean, and Japanese gaming officials. In a March 2013 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Wynn noted that while the Okada dispute could cut into Wynn&#x27;s profits, beyond an &quot;informal&quot; SEC inquiry into the Macau donation, there was no formal investigation underway. In July 2013, the SEC announced that its investigation into the Macau donations was concluded and it would not pursue any enforcement action against Wynn or Wynn Resorts.

In 2014, Wynn sued hedge fund manager James Chanos for slander after Chanos, at a Berkeley event, allegedly said Wynn violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Wynn&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed, with U.S. District Judge William Orrick III ruling that Chanos&#x27;s remark was constitutionally protected speech. Wynn was also ordered to pay Chanos&#x27; legal fees. Wynn&#x27;s subsequent appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Wynn has sought to weaken Nevada&#x27;s anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) legislation. He has publicly clashed with Yelp over the issue.

In March 2024, Wynn filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to overturn New York Times v. Sullivan, which protects the media&#x27;s ability to aggressively cover public officials.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===
Wynn has dealt with several legal issues related to sexual misconduct allegations that were covered by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2018. One accusation came from a manicurist whom Wynn later paid a $7.5 million settlement. In February 2018, Nevada regulators fined Wynn&#x27;s company $20 million for failing to respond to sexual misconduct claims. In April 2019, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission fined Wynn Resorts $35 million due to the gaming authority&#x27;s findings that former company executives covered up sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn.

Angelica Limcaco, a former salon manager at Wynn Las Vegas, filed a federal lawsuit in 2018 against Wynn Resorts and Steve Wynn claiming that she was fired, blacklisted and intimidated into silence after she elevated her concerns in 2006 to then-president of Wynn Las Vegas, Andrew Pascal. The case was appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after Judge Miranda Du ruled in favor of Wynn Las Vegas, holding that the claim was not made within the statute of limitations and Angelica Limcaco&#x27;s attorney, Jordan Matthews, argued that the time limits should not apply because Limcaco feared for her personal safety. Jordan Matthews filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit in March 2020 questioning the Nevada District Court&#x27;s selection of Elayna Youchah as a magistrate judge. Elayna Youchah was Wynn Las Vegas&#x27; lead counsel in the Limcaco case and Youchah was apparently selected just before Judge Du dismissed Limcaco&#x27;s case. Matthews argued there was no disclosure about this apparent conflict of interest. In May 2020, Judges William A. Fletcher, Jay S. Bybee and Paul J. Watford, heard oral argument on the Limcaco case in San Francisco, California. Jordan Matthews argued that the lower court&#x27;s decision should be reversed. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission Report confirmed that Wynn Las Vegas and Steve Wynn took steps to remove a rape victim immediately after Limcaco reported the rape and Limcaco was then threatened by her superior, Doreen Whennen, to remain silent.

In March 2018, lawyer Lisa Bloom announced that she would represent a former dancer in a sexual misconduct suit against Wynn. In response, Wynn filed a defamation lawsuit against Bloom, pointing out that he is legally blind and could not &quot;leer&quot; at dancers. In April 2018, Wynn filed a defamation lawsuit against his former employee Jorgen Nielsen after he made negative comments about Wynn&#x27;s alleged sexual misconduct to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and ABC news. In October 2019, Neilsen filed a lawsuit against Wynn Resorts, its CEO, Matthew Maddox, its former general counsel, Kim Sinatra, and Wynn Resorts former head of security, James Stern, for allegedly spying on him. In April 2019, James Stern, a former FBI agent and the former executive vice president of corporate security for Wynn Resorts, resigned after testifying before the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to spying on Elaine Wynn and other employees. According to court documents filed by Wynn&#x27;s lawyers in 2018, Wynn had reached a settlement in 2006 with another former Wynn employee who had accused him of sexual misconduct. The settlement included a non-disclosure agreement. After the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article came out, the woman announced to Wynn&#x27;s lawyer that she intended to speak publicly about the settlement, and the lawyer reported her to the FBI for extortion; no charges were filed.

In 2020, a Nevada judge ruled that a woman defamed Wynn when she reported in 2018 that he had raped her in the 1970s, noting that her testimony lacked veracity.

In July 2020, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit without prejudice against Wynn Resorts, Ltd., which was filed by nine anonymous employees. The federal judge said the women could not justify why it was necessary to file the lawsuit anonymously. Since Judge James C. Mahan dismissed the case without prejudice, the lawsuit can be refiled.

<text>Guard tone is a feature of wireline modems.

The guard tone is sent by the answering modem after it has sent the answer tone. It is a single continuous tone with a frequency of either 1800 Hz or 550 Hz, sent at a level of -6dB or -3dB, respectively, below the level of the transmitted data signal power.

It is used with V.22 and V.22bis modulation modes to prevent the high-band data signal from interfering with the operation of billing apparatus in certain countries where in-band signalling was commonplace in the 20th century.

1800 Hz is used in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, while 550 Hz is used in some Scandinavian countries. Guard tones are not used in North America.

The guard tone is controlled by the AT command of the Hayes command set.

North American Bell 103-style modems (300 bit/s) were incompatible with UK in-band signalling (the modem tones would disconnect the call) unless a guard tone is provided. Most of these (now-obsolete) modems did not support any command set and were unusable for international calls.

<text>ChildFund, also known an ChildFund International, and formerly known as Christian Children&#x27;s Fund, is a child-focused international development organization that provides assistance to children facing poverty and other challenges in 24 countries, including the United States. ChildFund&#x27;s headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia, United States.

==Mission==
ChildFund provides services to children, mostly funded by individual contributors in the form of monthly child sponsorships. In addition, ChildFund receives grants and donations that support vocational training, literacy training, food distribution, educational programs, early childhood development, health and immunization programs, nutritional programs, water and sanitation development, and emergency relief in both man-made and natural disasters.

The organization was formerly known for its TV commercials on major networks in the United States. A previous long-running series of advertisements had featured actress Sally Struthers as spokeswoman, who around the same time also did commercials for International Correspondence Schools. It was also known for its Christmas commercials that featured the song &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;.

==History==
ChildFund was founded on October 6, 1938, as China&#x27;s Children Fund by Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke to aid Chinese children displaced by the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the mission expanded to other countries, the name was changed on February 6, 1951 to Christian Children&#x27;s Fund.

In June 2002, the Christian Children&#x27;s Fund and 11 other international child sponsorship organizations founded a worldwide network, the ChildFund Alliance. The ChildFund Alliance comprises 12 organizations that partner to improve the lives of children and their families in more than 60 countries. On July 1, 2009, Christian Children&#x27;s Fund changed its name to ChildFund International. The name change took into consideration donor confusion and to clarify that the organization was not functioning as a Christian organization. Some criticized the organization for appearing to be a Christian organization long after it had ended its religious affiliation.

==Child sponsorship model==
Individual sponsors contribute funds on a monthly basis. Sponsor funds are combined to benefit entire communities. Each country&#x27;s office develops its own programs based on the needs of local communities, but common programs include early childhood development programs, health care, clean water, and nutrition support. Sponsored children or their family members send letters to sponsors. ChildFund encourages sponsors to correspond with children through letters and photographs as well. The organization also features an electronic correspondence program. The letters are translated by representatives of the organization. Sponsors also receive annual progress reports and updated photographs of their sponsored children. Sponsors can travel to meet their sponsored children but must undergo a background check.

==Efficiency and financials==
Charity Navigator gives ChildFund a rating of four out of four stars. For 2019, ChildFund allocated its $215.1 million in public support &amp; revenue as follows:
*Program expenses: 77.8%
*Administrative expenses: 9.4%
*Fundraising expenses: 12.8%

==Publications==
ChildFund releases a number of publications every quarter to six months, including but not limited to annual reports;

==Global COVID-19 response==
In April 2020, ChildFund launched a $56 million global response plan to reach 6.3 million children and family members in 61 countries affected by the COVID-19 crisis. It was the largest emergency response in the organization’s history and had four priorities: fighting child hunger, equipping children and families with health and hygiene information and supplies, protecting children from violence and exploitation, and helping children continue their education. To date, the organization has assisted hundreds of thousands of families through direct cash transfers and other aid.

<doc id="698477" wikidata="Q152285" url="?curid=698477" title="Urinal">
<text>A urinal (, ) is a sanitary plumbing fixture similar to a toilet, but for urination only. Urinals are often provided in men&#x27;s public restrooms in Western countries (less so in Muslim countries). They are usually used in a standing position. Urinals can be equipped with manual flushing, automatic flushing, or without flushing, as is the case for waterless urinals. They can be arranged as single sanitary fixtures (with or without privacy walls), or in a trough design without privacy walls.

Urinals designed for females (&quot;female urinals&quot;) also exist but are rare. It is possible for females to use stand-up urinals using a female urination device. The term &quot;urinal&quot; may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a small container in which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden.

==Description==

A stand-up urinal can be used conveniently and appropriately by someone who has a penis or other adaptive means with which to urinate from a standing position. There is no age restriction, and urinals are commonly used by men and boys of all ages. Female urinals also exist but are not common. 

In busy public toilets, urinals are installed for efficiency. Compared with urination in a general-purpose toilet, usage is faster and more sanitary because at the urinal there are no additional doors or locks to touch, and no seat to turn up. Consistent use of urinals also keeps the toilet stalls cleaner and more available for persons who need to defecate. A urinal takes less space, is simpler, and consumes less water per flush (or even no water at all) than a flush toilet. Large numbers of them are usually installed along a common supply pipe and drain. Urinals may also come in different heights, to accommodate tall and short users.

Public urinals usually have a plastic mesh guard, which may optionally contain a deodorizing urinal deodorizer block or &quot;urinal cake&quot;. The mesh is intended to prevent solid objects (such as cigarette butts, feces, chewing gum, or paper) from being flushed and possibly causing a plumbing stoppage. In some restaurants, bars, and clubs, ice may be put in the urinals, serving some of the same purposes as the deodorizing block without dispensing odorous chemicals.

=== Arrangement ===

For purposes of space and economic practicality, urinals are not typically placed inside stalls. Unlike in female public toilets that do not have urinals, optimal resource efficiency in male restrooms therefore requires urinating in full visibility of other users. In recent years, it has become more common in some countries for dividers or partitions to be installed between urinals to eliminate any chance of incidental exposure during the process of urination.

Urinals in high-capacity public toilets are usually arranged in one or more rows directly opposite the door, so that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Often, one or two of the urinals, typically at one end of a long row, will be mounted lower than the others; they are meant for the disabled and other users who cannot reach the regular urinals. In facilities where people of various heights are present, such as schools, urinals that extend down to floor level may be used to allow anyone of any height to use any urinal.

Instead of individual fixtures, trough urinals may be installed. These designs can be used by a number of people simultaneously, but they do not allow for much privacy. They are often installed where there is a high peak demand, such as in schools, music festivals, theatrical events, sports stadiums, discos, dance clubs, and convention halls.

Urinals were once installed exclusively in commercial or institutional settings, but are also now available for private homes. They offer the advantages of substantial water savings in residences with many occupants, and reduction of &quot;splash back&quot;, making cleaning easier.

==Urinals with flushing==

Most public urinals incorporate a water flushing system to rinse urine from the bowl of the device, to prevent foul odors. The flush can be triggered by one of several methods:

===Manual handles===
This type of flush might be regarded as standard in the United States. Each urinal is equipped with a button or short lever to activate the flush, with users expected to operate it as they leave. Such a directly controlled system is the most efficient, provided that patrons remember to use it. This is far from certain, however, often because of fear of touching the handle, which is located too high to kick. Urinals with foot-activated flushing systems are sometimes found in high-traffic areas; these systems have a button set into the floor or a pedal on the wall at ankle height. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that flush valves be mounted no higher than AFF (above the finished floor). Additionally, the urinal is to be mounted no higher than AFF, and to have a rim that is tapered and elongated and protrudes at least from the wall. This enables users in wheelchairs to straddle the lip of the urinal and urinate without having to &quot;arc&quot; the flow of urine upwards.

===Timed flush===
In Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong and some parts of Sweden and Finland, manual flush handles are unusual. Instead, the traditional system is a timed flush that operates automatically at regular intervals. Groups of up to ten or more urinals will be connected to a single overhead cistern, which contains the timing mechanism. A constant drip-feed of water slowly fills the cistern until a tipping point is reached, when the valve opens (or a siphon begins to drain the cistern), and all the urinals in the group are flushed. Electronic controllers performing the same function are also used.

This system does not require any action from its users, but it is wasteful of water when toilets are used irregularly. However, in these countries users are so used to the automatic system, that attempts to install manual flushes to save water are generally unsuccessful. Users ignore them not through deliberate laziness or fear of infection, but because activating the flush is not habitual.

To help reduce water usage when public toilets are closed, some public toilets with timed flushing use an electric water valve connected to the room&#x27;s light switch. When the building is in active use during the day and the lights are on, the timed flush operates normally. At night when the building is closed, the lights are turned off and the flushing action stops.

===Door-regulated flush===
This is an older method of water-saving automatic flushing, which only operates when the public toilet has been used. A push-button switch is mounted in the door frame, and triggers the flush valve for all urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the urinals are not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the door opens.

Alternatively, a flushing system connected to the door can count the number of users, and operate when the number of door opening events reaches a certain value. At night, the door never opens, so flushing never occurs.

===Automatic flush===

Electronic automatic flushes solve the problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the urinal has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved away, and then activates the flush. There usually is also a small override button, to allow optional manual flushing.

Automatic flush facilities can be retrofitted to existing systems. The handle-operated valves of a manual system can be replaced with a suitably designed self-contained electronic valve, often battery-powered to avoid the need to add cables. Older timed-flush installations may add a device that regulates the water flow to the cistern according to the overall activity detected in the room. This does not provide true per-fixture automatic flushing, but is simple and cheap to add because only one device is required for the whole system.

To prevent false-triggering of the automatic flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected for at least five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the whole time that a presence is detected.

== Waterless urinals ==
Since about the 1990s urinals have been available on the market that use no water at all. These are called waterless urinals or flushless urinals.

The first waterless urinal was developed at the end of the 19th century by the German-Austrian Wilhelm Beetz using an oil-based syphon with a liquid that he called Urinol.

Waterless urinals can save between of water per urinal per year, depending on the amount of water used in the water-flushed urinal for comparison purposes, and the number of uses per day. For example, these numbers assume that the urinal would be used between 40 and 120 times per business day.

Waterless urinals allow the collection of undiluted pure urine which can be used as a fertilizer.

=== Odor control ===
Models of waterless urinals introduced by the Waterless Company in 1991 and others in 2001 by Falcon Waterfree Technologies and Sloan Valve Company, as well as Duravit, use a trap insert filled with a sealant liquid instead of water. The lighter-than-water sealant floats on top of the urine collected in the U-bend, preventing odors from being released into the air. The cartridge and sealant must be periodically replaced.

Waterless urinals may also use an outlet system that traps the odor, preventing the smell often present in toilet blocks. Another method to eliminate odor was introduced by Caroma, which installed a deodorizing block in their waterless urinal that was activated during use.

Odor control in waterless urinals is also achieved with simple one-way valves which are manufactured as a flat rubber tube (the tube opens when urine flows through) or with two silicone &quot;curtain&quot; pieces. The former is used in the waterless urinals by the company Keramag in Germany (model Centaurus) and the latter is marketed by the company Addicom in South Africa who called it the EcoSmellStop device.

=== Applications ===
Waterless urinals can be installed in high-traffic facilities, and in situations where providing a water supply may be difficult or where water conservation is desired.

Waterless urinals have become rather common in Germany since about 2009 and can be found at restaurants, cinemas, highway rest stops, train stations and so forth. It was estimated in 2009 that there are about 6 million urinals in Germany, and about 100,000 of those were of the waterless type in that year.

Due to high-level water restrictions during about 2005-2008 the city council of Brisbane, Australia mandated conversion to waterless urinals. Flush urinals are nowadays rarely seen in Brisbane.

=== Installation and maintenance ===
The drain pipes from waterless urinals need to be installed correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials in order to prevent buildup of struvite (&quot;urine stone&quot;) and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the undiluted urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine drain pipes.

Most waterless urinals do not prevent odorous staining on the surface of the urinals, and periodic cleaning of the fixture and its surrounds is still required. When maintained according to manufacturers&#x27; recommendations, well-designed waterless urinals do not emit any more odors than flushed urinals do. However, some odor-trapping devices work better than others in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types of waterless urinals, as per the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation.

=== Situation in the United States ===
US federal law has mandated no more than one gallon per flush since 1994, and the EPA estimates that the average urinal is flushed 20 times per day, which gives an average water use of per year. Mechanical traps are not allowed by US building codes but are allowed in many other countries.

Plumbers&#x27; unions initially opposed waterless urinals, citing concerns about health and safety, which have been debunked by scientists who have studied the devices. Facing opposition to their attempts to have the devices allowed in plumbing codes, manufacturers devised a compromise. The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow waterless urinals to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run to the back of the urinals. This allows conventional water-flushing urinals to be retrofitted later, if waterless models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time.

In March 2006, the Associated Press reported that the plumbers&#x27; union in Philadelphia had become upset because developer Liberty Property Trust had decided to use waterless urinals in the Comcast Center. Many in the union believed that this would lead to less work for them. The developer cited saving the city of water per year as its deciding factor.

In February 2010, the headquarters of the California EPA removed waterless urinals that were installed in 2003 due to &quot;hundreds of complaints&quot;, including odors and splashed urine on the floors. Officials blamed the failure of the project on incompatibility with the building&#x27;s existing plumbing systems.

== Street urinals ==

In some localities, urinals may be located on public sidewalks or in public areas such as parks. These urinals are often equipped with partitions for the sake of privacy, and some are fully enclosed structures. They may or may not be equipped with water flushing mechanisms.

The first &#x27;pissoirs&#x27; were installed in Paris in the 1830s, and the idea gradually gained popularity in other European cities. From a peak in the 1930s when there were over 1,000 in Paris alone, historic urinals have gradually disappeared, in favour of facilities for both sexes. In the 21st century, public urination by men in some locations was again seen as a nuisance, and modern versions of street urinals have been installed.

The Netherlands has a number of strategically placed street urinals in various cities, intended to reduce public urination by drunken men. Amsterdam has the largest collection of historic urinals, with about 30 &#x27;Plaskrul&#x27; (&#x27;pisscurl&#x27;), a flushless urinal with a curved privacy screen, in the central city. In recent years, urinals that can be retracted into the ground during the day or between special events have been installed, in order to save space when they are not expected to be needed. When closed they look like a large manhole in a sidewalk. Similar retractable models, such as the model by the Dutch company Urilift, are also seen in the UK and other countries. At night when bars are open they rise out of the sidewalk; some time after the bars close, the urinals return to their manhole configuration so that they are unseen by people during the day.

In the Philippines, Marikina was the first city to install street urinals in the late 1990s. When Marikina Mayor Bayani Fernando was appointed chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, he installed street urinals in the rest of Metro Manila as well.

==Special urinals==

=== Urinals designed for females ===

In the Western world, females are generally taught to sit or squat while urinating. Many therefore do not know how – or even that it is possible – for a female to aim her urine stream as would be required to use a stand-up urinal. Thus, several different types of urinals have been designed for females that do not require the user to aim their urine stream. A typical user could thus theoretically approach such a urinal squatting backwards over it without necessarily trying to aim their stream.

=== Arts and interactive urinals ===
&quot;Kisses!&quot; is a controversial urinal designed by the female Dutch designer Meike van Schijndel. It is shaped like an open pair of red lips. In early March 2004, the National Organization for Women (NOW) took offense to the new urinals that Virgin Atlantic decided to install in the Virgin Atlantic clubhouse at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York City. After receiving many angry phone calls from female customers, Virgin Atlantic Vice President John Riordan called NOW to apologize. Protestors surmised a connection to oral sex or urolagnia, and based their complaints on the urinals being sexist. A McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in the Netherlands removed them after a customer complained to the head office in the United States.

Interactive urinals have been developed in a number of countries, allowing users to entertain themselves during urination. One example is the Toylet, a video game system produced by the Japanese company Sega that allows users to play video games using their urine to control the on-screen action.

===Makeshift urinals===
During military operations, such as the Korean War, Vietnam War, or Operation Desert Storm, &quot;piss tubes&quot; were used as makeshift urinals. To make one, soldiers would affix an inverted disposable water bottle on one end of a rigid tube, burying the other end. Removing the base of the bottle made a funnel which would be left at the proper height. Deposited urine simply soaked into the ground; when the area became saturated, the device was relocated.

=== In vehicles ===
, the aircraft manufacturer Airbus offered its customers the option of installing urinals in its A380 aircraft.

==History==

In the spring of 1830, the city government of Paris decided to install the first public urinals on the major boulevards. They were put in place by the summer, but in July of the same year, many were destroyed through their use as materials for street barricades during the French Revolution of 1830.

The urinals were re-introduced in Paris after 1834, when over 400 were installed by Claude-Philibert Barthelot, comte de Rambuteau, the Préfet of the Department of the Seine. Having a simple cylindrical shape, built of masonry, open on the street side, and ornately decorated on the other side as well as the cap, they were popularly known as (&#x27;Rambuteau columns&#x27;). In response, Rambuteau suggested the name , in reference to the 1st century Roman emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus, who placed a tax on urine collected from public toilets for use in tanning. This is the usual term by which street urinals are known in the French speaking world, although and are also in common use.

In Paris, the next version was a masonry column that allowed for the pasting of posters on the side facing the footpath, creating a tradition that continues to this day (as a Morris column, a column with an elaborate roof and without the urinal).

Cast iron urinals were developed in the United Kingdom, with the Scottish firm of Walter McFarlane and Company casting urinals at their Saracen Foundry and erecting the first at Paisley Road, Glasgow in October 1850. By the end of 1852, nearly 50 cast iron urinals had been installed in Glasgow, including designs with more than one stall. Unlike Rambuteau&#x27;s columns, which were entirely open at the front, McFarlane&#x27;s one-man urinals were designed with spiral cast iron screens that allowed the user to be hidden from sight, and his multi-stall urinals were completely hidden within ornate, modular cast iron panels. Three manufacturers in Glasgow, Walter Macfarlane &amp; Co., George Smith (Sun Foundry) and James Allan Snr &amp; Son (Elmbank Foundry), supplied the majority of cast iron urinals across Britain and exported them around the world, including Australia and Argentina.

Back in Paris, cast iron urinals were introduced as part of Baron Haussmann&#x27;s remodelling of the city. A large variety of designs were produced in subsequent decades, housing two to 8 stalls, typically only screening the central portion of the user from public view, with the head and feet still visible. Screens were also added to Rambuteau columns. At the peak of their spread in the 1930s there were 1,230 in Paris, but by 1966 their number had decreased to 329. From 1980 they were replaced systematically with new technology, a unisex, enclosed, automatically self-cleaning unit called the .

In Berlin, the first , in wood, were erected in 1863. In order to provide a design as distinguished as in other cities, several architectural design competitions were organised in 1847, 1865 and 1877. The last design, proposed by a city councillor, was the one adopted in 1878, a cast-iron octagonal structure with seven stalls and a peaked roof, known locally as a Café Achteck (&#x27;Octagon Cafe&#x27;). In common with British designs, they provided complete enclosure, and were provided with interior lighting. Their number increased to 142 by 1920, but there are now only about a dozen remaining in use.

A similar design was adopted in Vienna, though simpler, smaller and hexagonal. They were equipped with a novel &quot;oil system&quot;, patented by Wilhelm Beetz in 1882, where a type of oil was used to neutralise odours, dispensing with the necessity for plumbing. About 15 are still in use, and one has been restored and set up as a display in the Vienna Technical Museum.

In central Amsterdam, there are about 35 pee curls, which consist of a raised metal screen that curls in a spiral enclosing a single urinal stall, including some two-person examples with the same details but a simpler shape. Though the design first emerged in the 1870s, an updated design by Joan van der Mey dates from 1916. All the remaining examples were restored in 2008.

 of various sizes and designs, but mostly in patterned cast-iron, can still be found dotted across the UK, with a few in London, but especially in Birmingham and Bristol. A solitary example of Walter McFarlane&#x27;s one-man spiral urinal remains in Thorn Park, Plymouth. A number have been restored and relocated to the grounds of various open-air museums and heritage railway lines.

Rectangular , with elaborate patterned cast-iron panels, similar in design to some of the UK ones, were installed in the city of Sydney, Australia, in 1880 and Melbourne, Australia, in the period 1903–1918. Of at least 40 that were made, nine remain in place and in use on the streets in and around central Melbourne, and have been classified by the National Trust since 1998.

In recent years, temporary with multiple unscreened urinals around a central column have been introduced in the UK. A temporary for women called the &#x27;Peeasy&#x27; is used in Switzerland.

Until the 1990s, street urinals were a common sight in Paris (France), and in the 1930s more than 1200 were in service. They were famous among foreign tourists. Parisians referred to them as &quot;vespasiennes&quot;, the name being derived from that of the Roman Emperor Vespasian, who, according to an anecdote, imposed a tax on urine. Beginning in the 1990s, the &quot;vespasiennes&quot; (renowned for their smell and lack of hygiene) were gradually replaced by Sanisettes. Today only one &quot;vespasienne&quot; remains in the city (on Boulevard Arago), and it is still regularly used. They still exist in other French cities and in other countries.

==Society and culture==
Examples of urinals in popular culture include:
* Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917), which some have called the most influential modern artwork, is a urinal which Duchamp signed &quot;R. Mutt&quot;.
* Police in Nassau County, New York adopted talking urinals in an anti-drunk driving initiative. Using Wizmark, a talking urinal display screen, police can provide bars with free pre-programmed urinal messages urging patrons not to drink and drive.
* Ernest Hemingway converted a urinal from Sloppy Joe&#x27;s bar into a water fountain for his cats. The fountain remains a prominent feature at his former home in Key West, Florida, a popular tourist destination in the town.
* &quot;Pissoir&quot;, retitled &quot;Urinal&quot; in some countries, was the first feature film directed by John Greyson. It was released in 1980 and takes place in a toilet.
* Gabriel Chevallier&#x27;s 1934 satirical novel &quot;Clochemerle&quot; deals with the ramifications of plans to install a new urinal in a French village.
* &quot;Indiana Urinalysis&quot; (1988) is a documentary on the subject of urinals. Topics include &quot;types of urinals, urinal etiquette, usage of urinal cakes, why urinals are always white, preference of urinal vs. toilet, and urinals for women, as well as a collection of urinal anecdotes.&quot; It received a Citation Award from the Indiana Film Society in 1990.
* &quot;Mystery of the Urinal Deuce&quot; is an episode of the American adult animated sitcom &quot;South Park&quot;, in which the plot revolves around the elementary school&#x27;s efforts to establish the identity of a person who defecated in a urinal.

<text>Robert Norman Davis (born 14 March 1945), best known by his stage name, Jasper Carrott, is an English comedian, actor, singer and television presenter. He starred in the sitcoms &quot;The Detectives&quot; and &quot;All About Me&quot;, and presented the game show &quot;Golden Balls&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Shaftmoor Lane, Acocks Green, in Birmingham, Carrott was educated at Acocks Green Primary School and Moseley Grammar School. He worked as a trainee buyer at a city centre department store, the Beehive, with schoolmate Bev Bevan.

He acquired the nickname Jasper aged nine, and added the surname Carrott when he was 17.

==Career==

In February 1969, he started his own folk club, &quot;The Boggery&quot;, in nearby Solihull with his friend Les Ward. Carrott performed folk songs and as an MC. His banter overtook the songs and he became more a comedian than a singer. He also worked as a musical agent (with John Starkey, who was his manager from 1974 to 1992), as Fingimigig, managing among others Harvey Andrews. He toured UK rugby clubs. He recorded an album in 1973 called &quot;Jasper Carrott – In the Club&quot;, which he sold from his van. The album contained the original &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot;, although mainly material used in his next three LPs (such as &quot;Hare Krishna&quot;, &quot;Car Insurance&quot;, &quot;Bastity Chelt&quot;, and &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;) plus the Fred Wedlock song &quot;The Folker&quot;.

He had a UK Top 5 chart hit in August 1975 with the novelty double A-side record, &quot;Funky Moped&quot; / &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot;, written by Chris Rohmann and produced by Jeff Lynne, with Bev Bevan on drums and backing vocals on the former track, recorded at Grosvenor Road Studios for DJM Records.

By the late 1970s, Carrott had developed anecdotal sketches which he still performs. Often they purport to be autobiographical; many celebrate the Birmingham accent and culture, including his support of Birmingham City.

His live performances were recorded as &quot;Jasper Carrott Rabbitts on and on and on...&quot; and &quot;Carrott in Notts&quot;. Notable tracks were &quot;Bastity Chelt&quot;, a song in Spoonerism, &quot;The Football Match&quot; describing a visit to Old Trafford, &quot;The Nutter on the Bus&quot; (including the cry &quot;Has anybody seen my camel?&quot;), &quot;The Mole&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s only one way to get rid of a mole – blow its bloody head off!&quot;) and &quot;Zits&quot; – an explanation of American slang for spots that brought the word into use in Britain.
In 1979, he published &quot;A Little Zit on the Side&quot;, a humorous autobiography. The follow-up, &quot;Sweet and Sour Labrador&quot;, mixed sections of stand-up routines with similar autobiographical material, much of it related to his world travels. Carrott was once a compère for the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986, which featured local bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and the Moody Blues, with a finale that included George Harrison from the Beatles. On 15 September 2007, he was inducted into the Birmingham Walk of Stars at the Arts Fest 2007 celebrations. The award was presented by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Carrott is the second inductee, following Ozzy Osbourne. Carrott was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the British Comedy Awards on 6 December 2008.

His first appearance on television was a half-hour show for BBC Midlands on 11 August 1975, in a programme about local football called &quot;The Golden Game&quot;. In 1976, he appeared in &quot;A Half Hour Mislaid with Jasper Carrott&quot;, recorded at Pebble Mill. His big break came two years later, when Michael Grade asked for a pilot programme for LWT. Grade liked it, and five further shows were recorded, which became his first TV series, &quot;An Audience with Jasper Carrott&quot;, in 1978. This partnership with LWT lasted until 1981; &quot;The Unrecorded Jasper Carrott&quot; (1979) and &quot;Beat the Carrott&quot; (1981) are the best-known live stand-up performances from his time with LWT.

Carrott moved to the BBC for &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Lib&quot;, a Saturday night comedy broadcast live, and then a string of BBC shows. These included &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Commercial Breakdown&quot;, which broadcast weird adverts from around the world, and the sketch and stand-up shows &quot;Carrott Confidential&quot;, &quot;24 Carrott Gold&quot;, &quot;The Trial of Jasper Carrott,&quot; and &quot;Canned Carrott&quot;, some of which also featured Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. One popular sketch involved Carrott reading out genuine, but bizarre motor insurance claim statements, such as &quot;I drove out of my drive at 7am and drove straight into a bus. The bus was ten minutes early.&quot;

Carrott played Heinrich in the 1987 British comedy film &quot;Jane and the Lost City&quot;.

&quot;Canned Carrott&quot; also featured a spoof police drama called &quot;The Detectives&quot;, co-starring Robert Powell, which later was made into a series. From 2002 to 2004, he starred in the sitcom &quot;All About Me&quot;. In a twelve-week run in the summer of 2002 he played the part of Ko-Ko in comic opera &quot;The Mikado&quot;, written by Gilbert and Sullivan at the Savoy Theatre in London.

He performed in several of the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; charity concerts for Amnesty International, and returned to the stage in 2004 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham featuring classic routines from his career. He returned to singing for the musical &quot;Go Play Up Your Own End&quot; (written by Malcolm Stent, songs by Harvey Andrews) in 2005.

In 2005, he staged and appeared in the first &quot;Jasper Carrott&#x27;s Rock With Laughter&quot; concert. This became a regular at the NEC in Birmingham, usually in December and sometimes alternating with his &quot;Jasper Carrott&#x27;s Christmas Crackers&quot; events.

In summer 2007, Carrott hosted the Endemol-produced game show &quot;Golden Balls&quot; for ITV1.

He hosted the Sunday night national pub quiz, &quot;Cash Inn&quot;. He was 20th in Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Stand-Up Comedians show.

In August 2017, Carrott underwent an operation to clear a blocked artery, followed by a quadruple heart bypass. A 30-date tour was cancelled. He has since said the surgery gave him a new lease of life and he has no plans to retire, citing Ken Dodd&#x27;s longevity as an example.

In 2023 Carrott played the character Sykesy in the BBC Radio 4 radio serial drama &quot;The Archers&quot;.

==Literary work==
Carrott has written the humorous paperbacks &quot;A Little Zit on the Side&quot; (1979), and &quot;Sweet and Sour Labrador&quot; (1982). He also wrote a novel called &quot;Shop! or a Store is Born&quot;.

Carrott&#x27;s former manager, John Starkey, has written a book entitled &quot;Jasper and Me&quot; (1993; Etsiketsi Books), which included the line, &quot;He once said, &#x27;Ringo isn&#x27;t the best drummer in the world. He isn&#x27;t even the best drummer in the Beatles&#x27;&quot;. This quote was credited to John Lennon until Mark Lewisohn discovered, in 1983, that it was Carrott who said it.

==Business interests==
Carrott was part-owner of the production company Celador, makers of &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; In 2006, he and wife Hazel sold their shares for £10m when Dutch interactive television company 2waytraffic bought the group of companies behind &quot;Millionaire&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carrott married journalist Hazel Jackson in 1972. Their daughter is the actress Lucy Davis.

He is a supporter, and was a director, of Birmingham City Football Club; a hospitality suite at their St Andrew&#x27;s ground is named after him. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2003 New Year Honours &quot;for charitable services&quot;. The University of Birmingham awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2004, following a similar award from Aston University in 1995.

<doc id="698505" wikidata="Q2531577" url="?curid=698505" title="Camera control unit">
<text>The camera control unit (CCU) is typically part of a live television broadcast chain. It is responsible for powering the professional video camera, handling signals sent over the camera cable to and from the camera, and can be used to control various camera parameters remotely.

== History ==
Before cameras became self-contained units, broadcast cameras required vast racks of control units just to generate a usable picture. In outside broadcast production, these racks took up an entire section of the OB truck and were operated by a small team of skilled engineers. These vision engineers had two roles. Firstly, they set up the CCUs at the start of a production and ensured that the picture created was of broadcast quality. This process included a lengthy alignment process in which the vision engineer would work with the camera operator, to adjust the settings on both the actual camera and the CCU in tandem. During production, it was the vision engineers&#x27; job to operate the CCUs and control both the exposure and the colour balance. So skilled and labour-intensive was this role that each CCU required its own dedicated vision engineer.

== Benefits ==
Modern cameras are typically more self-contained than their predecessors and many can operate without a CCU. Even when not required, a CCU can be of benefit for the following reasons:

* In a system with a multiple-camera setup, the cameras can be matchedmade to look the same in terms of colour balance and picture intensity without having to ask camera operators to make an adjustment.
* The camera operators are freed from the control of iris, black level and colour balance, leaving them free to concentrate on other aspects of camerawork such as blocking and image composition.
* All signals that operate between the camera and CCU are carried in one multicore cable, triax or fiber optic cable.

== Functions ==
A CCU is often used in conjunction with a remote-control panel (RCP), a waveform monitor and a vectorscope to rack and match many cameras together remotely.

Common adjustable parameters include:
* Iris (see aperture)
* Color temperature filters
* Neutral density filters
* Shutter speed
* Saturation
* Master gain
* Master black (pedestal)
* Black level trim (for red, green and blue components)
* Gain trim (for red, green and blue components)

In addition to these, there are usually options internally generating a test card for testing, return feeds or talkback. For more complex productions, preset scene files can be recalled to quickly change the settings of the camera on the fly.

== Connectivity ==
Broadcast cameras typically carry several signals over the camera cable in addition to the camera output itself.

Typically, RGB signals are transmitted over the camera cable. The CCU will usually convert these to SDI, YUV or composite for interfacing to other video equipment - typically it will be connected to a vision mixer via a video router.

Typical signals can be both digital signal and analog signals: 
* Video out (Serial digital interface (SDI))
* Video out (composite video)
* Video out (component video)
* Audio out (microphone on board)
* Video in (genlock in the form of color burst)
* Return video in (composite)typically for a teleprompter
* Return video incarrying the output from the vision mixer
* Interruptible feedback Intercom
* Tally light trigger

<text>Mizrahi Jews (), also known as Mizrahim () in plural and Mizrahi () in singular, and alternatively referred to as Oriental Jews or Edot HaMizrach (, ), are terms used in Israeli discourse to refer to a grouping of Jewish communities that lived in the Muslim world.
&quot;Mizrahi&quot; is a political sociological term that was coined with the creation of the State of Israel. It translates as &quot;Easterner&quot; in Hebrew. 

The term &quot;Mizrahi&quot; is almost exclusively applied to descendants of Jewish communities from North Africa, Central Asia, West Asia, and parts of the North Caucasus. This includes Yemenite Jews, Kurdish Jews, Turkish Jews, Egyptian Jews, Syrian Jews, Lebanese Jews, Iraqi Jews, Bahraini Jews, Algerian Jews, Libyan Jews, Moroccan Jews, Tunisian Jews, Iranian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Afghan Jews, Mountain Jews, and Georgian Jews.

Indian Jews are sometimes labeled as &quot;Mizrahi,&quot; though members of the community have identified themselves as a separate category, as South Asian. 

These various Jewish communities were first officially grouped into a singular identifiable division during World War II, when they were distinctly outlined in the One Million Plan of the Jewish Agency for Israel, which detailed the methods by which Jews of the diaspora were to be returned to the Land of Israel (then under the British Mandate for Palestine) after the Holocaust.
An earlier cultural community of southern and eastern Jews were the Sephardi Jews. Before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the various current communities of Mizrahi Jews did not identify themselves as a distinctive Jewish subgroup, and many considered themselves Sephardis, as they largely followed the Sephardic customs and traditions of Judaism with local variations in &quot;minhagim&quot;. The original Sephardi Jewish community was formed in Spain and Portugal, and after their expulsion in 1492, many Sephardim settled in areas where Mizrahi communities already existed. This complicated ethnography has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in official Israeli ethnic and religious terminology, with &quot;Sephardi&quot; being used in a broad sense to include Mizrahi Jews, as well as Sephardim proper from Southern Europe around the Mediterranean Basin. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel has placed rabbis of Mizrahi origin in Israel under the jurisdiction of the Sephardi chief rabbis.

Following the First Arab–Israeli War, over 850,000 Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews were expelled or evacuated from Arab and Muslim-majority countries between 1948 and the early 1980s. A 2018 statistic found that 45% of Jewish Israelis identified as either Mizrahi or Sephardic.

==Terminology==
&quot;Mizrahi&quot; is literally translated as &#x27;Oriental&#x27;, &#x27;Eastern&#x27;, , Hebrew for &#x27;east&#x27;. In the past, the word &quot;Mizrahim&quot;, corresponding to the Arabic word (, &#x27;Easterners&#x27;), referred to the natives of Turkey, Iraq and other Asian countries, as distinct from those of North Africa (, &#x27;Westerners&#x27;). In medieval and early modern times, the corresponding Hebrew word () was used for North Africa. In Talmudic and Geonic times, however, this word referred to the land of Israel, as contrasted with Babylonia. For this reason, many object to the use of &quot;Mizrahi&quot; to include Moroccan and other North African Jews.

During the 1940s, before Israel&#x27;s establishment, the demographer Roberto Bachi used the categories of &quot;Mizrahim&quot; and &quot;Ashkenzim&quot; in his ethnic classification of the Yishuv. In the 1950s, the Jews who came from the communities listed above were simply called and known as Jews (, in Arabic) and to distinguish them in the Jewish sub-ethnicities, Israeli officials, who themselves were mostly Eastern European Jews, transferred the name to them, though most of these immigrants arrived from lands located further westward than Central Europe. Mizrahi is subsequently among the surnames most often changed by Israelis, and many scholars, including Avshalom Kor, claim that the transferring of the name &quot;Mizrahim&quot; was a form of Orientalism towards the Oriental Jews, similar to the ways in which had labeled as &quot;second class&quot; and excluded them from possible positions of power.

The usage of the term or (), Oriental communities, grew in Israel under the circumstances of the meeting of waves of Jewish immigrants from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, followers of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani (Yemenite) rites. In modern Israeli usage, it refers to all Jews from Central and West Asian countries, many of them Arabic-speaking Muslim-majority countries. The term came to be widely used more by Mizrahi activists in the early 1990s. Since then in Israel it has become an accepted semi-official and media designation.

Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Mizrahi Jews did not identify themselves as a separate Jewish subgroup. Instead, Mizrahi Jews generally characterized themselves as &quot;Sephardi&quot;, as they follow the customs and traditions of Sephardi Judaism (but with some differences among the &quot;customs&quot; of particular communities). That has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in Israel and in religious usage, with &quot;Sephardi&quot; being used in a broad sense and including Mizrahi Jews, North African Jews as well as Sephardim proper. From the point of view of the official Israeli rabbinate, any rabbis of Mizrahi origin in Israel are under the jurisdiction of the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel.

Sami Michael rejects the terms and , claiming it is a fictitious identity advanced by Mapai to preserve a &quot;rival&quot; to the and help them push the below in the social-economic ladder and behind them, so they won&#x27;t ever be in line with the Israeli elites of European Jewish descent. He also speaks against the Mapai manner of labeling all the Oriental Jews as &quot;one folk&quot; and erasing their unique and individual history as separated communities; he says that he wonders why the real Easterners of his time who were the Eastern European Jewish peasants from the villages weren&#x27;t labeled as &quot;Mizrahi&quot; in Israel, despite fitting it more than the Oriental Jews who were labeled that way. Michael is also against the inclusion of Oriental Jewish communities who do not descend from Sepharadic Jews, as &quot;Sepharadim&quot; by the Israeli politicians, calling it &quot;historically inaccurate&quot;. He also claims that his work as an author is always referred to as &quot;Ethnic&quot;, while European Jews&#x27; work, even if historic in theme, is not, as a result of racism.
Most of the &quot;Mizrahi&quot; activists actually originated from North African Jewish communities, traditionally called &quot;Westerners&quot; (), rather than &quot;Easterners&quot; (). The Jews who emigrated to Palestine from North Africa in the 19th Century and prior started their own political and religious organization in 1860 which operated in Jerusalem was called &quot;The Western Jewish Diaspora Council&quot; (). Many Jews originated from Arab and Muslim countries today reject (or any) umbrella description, and prefer to identify themselves by their particular country of origin, or that of their immediate ancestors, such as &quot;Moroccan Jew&quot;, or prefer to use the old term in its broader meaning.

==Religious rite designations==
Today, many identify non-Ashkenazi rite Jews as Sephardi – in modern Hebrew &quot;Sfaradim&quot; – mixing ancestral origin and religious rite. This broader definition of &quot;Sephardim&quot; as including all, or most, Mizrahi Jews is also common in Jewish religious circles. During the past century, the Sephardi rite absorbed part of the unique rite of the Yemenite Jews, and lately, Beta Israel religious leaders in Israel have also joined Sefardi rite collectivities, especially following rejection of their Jewishness by some Ashkenazi circles.

The reason for this classification of all Mizrahim under Sephardi rite is that most Mizrahi communities use much the same religious rituals as Sephardim proper due to historical reasons. The prevalence of the Sephardi rite among Mizrahim is partially a result of Sephardim proper joining some of Mizrahi communities following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, which expelled Jews from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal). Over the last few centuries, the previously distinctive rites of the Mizrahi communities were influenced, superimposed upon or altogether replaced by the rite of the Sephardim, perceived as more prestigious. Even before this assimilation, the original rite of many Jewish Oriental communities was already closer to the Sephardi rite than to the Ashkenazi one. For this reason, &quot;Sephardim&quot; has come to mean not only &quot;Spanish Jews&quot; proper but &quot;Jews of the Spanish rite&quot;, just as &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; is used for &quot;Jews of the German rite&quot;, whether or not their families originate in Germany.

Many of the Sephardi Jews exiled from Spain resettled in greater or lesser numbers in the Arab world, such as Syria and Morocco. In Syria, most eventually intermarried with, and assimilated into, the larger established communities of Musta&#x27;rabim and Mizrahim. In some North African countries, such as Morocco, Sephardi Jews came in greater numbers, and so largely contributed to the Jewish settlements that the pre-existing Jews were assimilated by the more recently arrived Sephardi Jews. Either way, this assimilation, combined with the use of the Sephardi rite, led to the popular designation and conflation of most non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities from Western Asia and North Africa as &quot;Sephardi rite&quot;, whether or not they were descended from Spanish Jews, which is what the terms &quot;Sephardi Jews&quot; and &quot;Sfaradim&quot; properly implied when used in the ethnic as opposed to the religious sense.

In some Arabic countries, such as Egypt and Syria, Sephardi Jews arrived via the Ottoman Empire would distinguish themselves from the already established Musta&#x27;rabim, while in others, such as Morocco and Algeria, the two communities largely intermarried, with the latter embracing Sephardi customs and thus forming a single community.

==Language==
===Arabic===
In the Arab world (such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan), Mizrahim most often speak Arabic. Most of the many notable philosophical, religious and literary works of the Jews in Spain, North Africa and Asia were written in Arabic using a modified Hebrew alphabet.

===Aramaic===

Aramaic is a Semitic language subfamily. Specific varieties of Aramaic are identified as &quot;Jewish languages&quot; since they are the languages of major Jewish texts such as the Talmud and &quot;Zohar&quot;, and many ritual recitations such as the Kaddish. Traditionally, Aramaic has been a language of Talmudic debate in yeshivot, as many rabbinic texts are written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic. The current Hebrew alphabet, known as &quot;Assyrian lettering&quot; or &quot;the square script&quot;, was in fact borrowed from Aramaic.

In Kurdistan, a region which includes parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, the language of the Mizrahim is a variant of Aramaic. As spoken by the Kurdish Jews, Judeo-Aramaic languages are Neo-Aramaic languages descended from Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. They are related to the Christian Aramaic dialects spoken by Assyrian people, which are Syriac Christians who claim descent from Assyria, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, dating back to 2500 BC in ancient Mesopotamia.

===Persian and other languages and dialects===
Among other languages associated with Mizrahim are Judeo-Iranian languages such as Judeo-Persian, the Bukhori dialect, Judeo-Tat, and Kurdish languages; Georgian; Judeo-Marathi and Judeo-Malayalam. Bukharian Jews from various countries in Central Asia and the Mountain Jews living in Azerbaijan are also widely fluent in Russian due to several of those countries&#x27; former status as republics of the Soviet Union.

== History ==

The Jewish diaspora in the Middle East outside the Land of Israel started in the 6th century BCE, during the Babylonian captivity, which also caused some Jews to flee to Egypt. Other early diaspora areas in the Middle East and North Africa were Persia, Yemen and Cyrene.

As Islam started to spread in the 7th century CE, Jews who were living under Muslim rule became &quot;dhimmis&quot;. Because Jews were seen as &quot;People of the Book&quot;, they were allowed to practice their own religion, but they had an inferior status in an Islamic society. Even though Jews in the Middle East and North Africa formed strong attachments to the areas in which they lived, they were seen as a community which was clearly distinct from other communities. For example, while Musta&#x27;arabi Jews in the Arab world were influenced by the local culture, e.g. they started speaking variants of the Arabic language and ate their own versions of the same food, they did not adopt Arab identity. Instead, Jews in the Arab world saw themselves (including the ones with family background of converts) and were seen as fundamentally a part of the wider collective of the Jewish people, and they maintained their identity as the descendants of the ancient Israelite tribes.

Some Mizrahim migrated to India, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.

===Post-1948 dispersal===
After the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War, most Mizrahim were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel. According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin.

Anti-Jewish actions by Arab governments in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of the founding of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa. The exodus of 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt after the 1956 Suez Crisis led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees. Most went to Israel. Many Moroccan and Algerian Jews went to France. Thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jews emigrated to the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and other countries in the Americas. 

Today, as many as 40,000 Mizrahim still remain in communities scattered throughout the non-Arab Muslim world, primarily in Iran, but also Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. There are few Maghrebim remaining in the Arab world. About 3,000 remain in Morocco and 1,100 in Tunisia. Other countries with remnants of ancient Jewish communities with official recognition, such as Lebanon, have 100 or fewer Jews. A trickle of emigration continues, mainly to Israel and the United States.

==Memorialization in Israel==
9 May 2021, the first physical memorialization in Israel of the Departure and Expulsion of Jews from Arab land and Iran was placed on the Sherover Promenade in Jerusalem. It is titled the Departure and Expulsion Memorial following the Knesset law for the annual recognition of the Jewish experience held annually on 30 November.

The text on the Memorial reads;

&quot;With the birth of the State of Israel, over 850,000
Jews were forced from Arab Lands and Iran.
The desperate refugees were welcomed by Israel.

By Act of the Knesset: 30 Nov, annually, is the
Departure and Expulsion Memorial Day.
Memorial donated by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation,
With support from the World Sephardi Federation, City of Jerusalem and the Jerusalem Foundation&quot;

The sculpture is the interpretive work of Sam Philipe, a fifth generation Jerusalemite.

===Absorption into Israeli society===
Refuge in Israel was not without its tragedies: &quot;In a generation or two, millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity&quot;, had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat. The trauma of rupture from their countries of origin was further complicated by the difficulty of the transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (ma&#x27;abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships.

Mizrahi immigrants arrived speaking many languages:
* many, especially those from North Africa and the Fertile Crescent, spoke Arabic dialects;
* those from Iran spoke Persian and various Judeo-Iranian languages;
* Mountain Jews from Azerbaijan and Dagestan spoke Judeo-Tat;
* Bukharian Jews from various countries in Central Asia (primarily Uzbekistan) spoke the Bukhori dialect.

Mizrahim from elsewhere brought Georgian, Judaeo-Georgian and various other languages with them. Hebrew had historically been a language only of prayer for most Jews not living in Israel, including the Mizrahim. Thus, with their arrival in Israel, the Mizrahim retained culture, customs and language distinct from their Ashkenazi counterparts. The collective estimate for Mizrahim (circa 2018) is at 4,000,000.

====Disparities and integration====

The cultural differences between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews impacted the degree and rate of assimilation into Israeli society, and sometimes the divide between Eastern European and Middle Eastern Jews was quite sharp. Segregation, especially in the area of housing, limited integration possibilities over the years. Intermarriage between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim is increasingly common in Israel and by the late 1990s 28% of all Israeli children had multi-ethnic parents (up from 14% in the 1950s). It has been claimed that intermarriage does not tend to decrease ethnic differences in socio-economic status, however, that does not apply to the children of inter-ethnic marriages.

Although social integration has increased, disparities persist. A study conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), Mizrahi Jews are less likely to pursue academic studies than Ashkenazi Jews. Israeli-born Ashkenazim are up to twice as likely to study in a university as Israeli-born Mizrahim. Furthermore, the percentage of Mizrahim who seek a university education remains low compared to second-generation immigrant groups of Ashkenazi origin, such as Russians. According to a survey by the Adva Center, the average income of Ashkenazim was 36 percent higher than that of Mizrahim in 2004.

In 2023, journalist Shany Littman believes the dynamics of inequality have reversed, with most Israeli cabinet ministers and City mayors being Mizrahi Jews; also she stated that middle-class Mizrahi women earned more than their Ashkenazi counterparts.

== Genetics ==

The Middle Eastern Jewish populations have a connection to the Jewish communities of Europe and North Africa in their paternal gene pool, suggesting a common Middle Eastern origin between them.

In autosomal analyses, the Iraqi Jews, Iranian Jews, Bukharian Jews, Kurdish Jews, Mountain Jews, and Georgian Jews form a cluster. When examined at a more detailed level, the groups can be separated from each other. This cluster plots between Levantine and Northern West Asian populations. Syrian and North African Jews are separate from it and closer to the Sephardi Jews. Yemenite Jews are distinct from other Jewish groups and cluster with the non-Jewish population of the Arabian Peninsula.

<text>John Henry Stracey MBE (born 22 September 1950) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1969 to 1978. He is a former welterweight world champion, having held the WBC and lineal welterweight titles between 1975 and 1976. At regional level, he held the British and European welterweight titles between 1973 and 1975, and is ranked by BoxRec as the eighth best British welterweight of all time.

==Amateur career==
Stracey competed for Great Britain as a lightweight at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He was defeated in the Round of 16 by eventual gold medallist Ronnie Harris. Stracey won the 1969 ABA light-welterweight championship.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Stracey began his professional career on 17 September 1969, knocking out Santos Martins in two rounds. Stracey won his first twelve fights, eleven by knockout, but against obscure opposition. Fight number thirteen was against Teddy Cooper, on 19 January 1971. Cooper was not a big name in boxing either, but this fight ended in controversy when Stracey won by a fifth round disqualification. On 5 October 1971 Stracey drew (tied) in ten rounds against Frankie Lewis.

Stracey produced five more wins before being matched with Marshall Butler, on 25 May 1972, at the Royal Albert Hall, suffering his first defeat after being outpointed by Butler over eight rounds. He then put a string of four more wins together, before facing Bobby Arthur for the British welterweight title, on 31 October, at the Royal Albert Hall. He lost the fight with another controversial ending: This time, Stracey found himself disqualified in round seven. Stracey then won five more bouts in a row. In February 1973, Stracey traveled to the United States, where he fought Danny McAloon on the undercard of the first Ali vs. Bugner fight, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, on 14 February. Stracey won the bout via unanimous decision. He then met Bobby Arthur in a rematch on 5 June, this time winning the British title with a fourth-round knockout.

===Stracey vs. Menetrey===
On 27 May 1974, Stracey got his chance at the European welterweight title, fighting Roger Menetrey at the Stade de Roland Garros, in Paris, France. Stracey won via eighth-round knockout. On 29 April 1975, he defended his European title against Max Hebeisen, at the Royal Albert Hall, winning via RTD in the sixth round.

===Stracey vs. Nápoles===
During the 1970s, it was a common practice to give world title shots to boxers that held continental titles. For example, the OPBF (Oriental Pacific Boxing Federation) champion would be given priority over other challengers for world title fights. Stracey was not the exception, and, after winning five more fights in a row (including a win over Ernie Lopez), he received his first world title shot: challenging WBC welterweight champion José Nápoles, in Nápoles&#x27; home-town of Mexico City, Mexico, on 6 December 1975. Stracey was sent down in round one, but he recuperated to close Nápoles&#x27; eye and have referee Octavio Meyran stop the fight in the sixth round, Stracey winning the world championship by a technical knockout. The new champion declared, &quot;He [Nápoles] could have knocked me down in every round but I&#x27;d have won it anyway&quot;. It was Nápoles&#x27; last fight.

===1976===
On 20 March 1976 he retained the title against perennial world title challenger Hedgemon Lewis by a knockout in round ten, but on 22 June, at Wembley, he lost the world title, being knocked out in twelve rounds by California-based Mexican Carlos Palomino. In his next fight, he lost to future world title challenger Dave Boy Green, with a badly damaged eye in round ten. Stracey retired as a winner when he knocked out George Warusfel in nine rounds in Islington on 23 May 1978.

==Outside the ring==
Stracey bought the Three Horseshoes pub in Briston, Norfolk, in 1975 and renamed it the John H Stracey. In 2011 the pub reverted to its original name. He also had, at one point, a boxing school in London.

John also had a hotel in Bournemouth with a public bar called The Ringside.when he was married to Michele, they also had a daughter called Laura.

<doc id="698552" wikidata="Q4927454" url="?curid=698552" title="Blonde on Blonde (rock group)">
<text>Blonde on Blonde was a guitar-led psychedelic rock group from South Wales.

The band was formed in Newport in 1967 by vocalist/guitarist Ralph Denyer, drummer Les Hicks, bassist/organist Richard Hopkins and guitarist/sitar player Gareth Johnson. The band was named after Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1966 album of the same name. 

In 1968 the quartet left Wales for London, and was joined by guitarist Simon Lawrance, playing clubs such as Middle Earth and appearing on the BBC TV series &quot;How Late It Is&quot;. Signing to Pye Records, they released their first album, &quot;Contrasts&quot;, produced by Barry Murray, in 1969. The album included the Robin Williamson covers &quot;No Sleep Blues&quot; and &quot;I Need My Friend&quot;, and a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. That summer they appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival.

1970&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth&quot; was released on Ember Records after a personnel change that saw Ralph Denyer joining Aquila and replaced by school friend David Thomas. Thomas&#x27; introduction gave the band a tougher, rock-oriented sound. Their second album included Moody Blues–styled ballads (&quot;Castles In The Sky&quot;), progressive rock songs (&quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know Me/Release&quot;) and fuzz-guitar-based rockers (&quot;November&quot;).

In 1971 Richard Hopkins left and was replaced by Graham Davis. Blonde on Blonde&#x27;s final album, &quot;Reflections on a Life&quot;, was released by Ember Records in 1971, but the band achieved only modest commercial success. They disbanded in early 1972.

Ralph Denyer went on to co-write &quot;The Guitar Handbook&quot; with Isaac Guillory. He died in 2011.

Richard Hopkins died in late October 2022.

Les Hicks died 29 October 2022.

<doc id="698559" wikidata="Q1661398" url="?curid=698559" title="John Brown (Rhode Island politician)">
<text>John Brown (January 27, 1736 – September 20, 1803) was an American merchant, politician and slave trader from Providence, Rhode Island. Together with his brothers Nicholas, Joseph and Moses, Brown was instrumental in founding Brown University (then known as the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations) and moving it to their family&#x27;s former estate in Providence.

Brown laid the cornerstone of the university&#x27;s oldest building in 1770, and he served as its treasurer for 21 years, from 1775 to 1796. He was also one of the founders of Providence Bank and served as its first president in 1791. Brown was active in the American Revolution, notably as an instigator of the 1772 &quot;Gaspee&quot; Affair, and he served in both state and national government. At the same time, he was a powerful voice of proslavery thought, clashing aggressively in newspapers, courts and the political system with his brother Moses, who had become an abolitionist.

Brown&#x27;s home in Providence is now a museum and National Historic Landmark. His personal desk and bookcase reside at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. The desk is attributed to Daniel Spencer, who opened his cabinetmaking studio in Providence, Rhode Island in 1772.

==Early life==

John Brown was born in Providence in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, on January 27, 1736, to James Brown II (1698–1739) and Hope Power (1702–1792). His paternal grandparents were Elder James Brown (1666–1716), a pastor at the First Baptist Church, and Mary (Harris) Brown. His father, James Brown II, established himself early in the mercantile business, trading in slaves, rum, molasses, and other goods. His parents, who were married in 1723, had six children, including: Mary (1731–1795), who married Dr. David Vanderlight, James (1724–1750), the eldest son who was a sea captain and who died young, Nicholas (1729–1791), Joseph (1733–1785), John (1736–1803) and Moses (1738–1836).

===Family===

John Brown was a descendant of Chad Brown, a co-founder of Providence and early Baptist minister at the First Baptist Church in America following Roger Williams. His uncle was Obadiah Brown I (1712–1762), who joined Brown&#x27;s father, James Brown II (1698–1739), in the mercantile trade in cocoa, rum, molasses. He also enslaved and sold men, women and children of African descent. Obadiah&#x27;s initial role was as master of his brother&#x27;s shipping vessels in the West Indies trade. After the death of Brown&#x27;s father in 1739, Obadiah retired from the sea himself, but continued the business. He also helped to raise James&#x27; young children, later forming a partnership with James&#x27; four surviving sons as &quot;Obadiah Brown &amp; Co.&quot; Obadiah Brown I, who married his first cousin, Mary Harris (1718–1805), daughter of Toleration and Sarah Harris, had eight children. All four of their sons died in early childhood, and their four daughters, Brown&#x27;s first cousins, were Phebe Brown (born 1738), who married John Fenner (brother of Governor Arthur Fenner), Sarah Brown (1742–1800), who married Lt. Gov. Jabez Bowen (1739–1815), Anna Brown (1744–1773), who married her first cousin, Moses Brown, and Mary Brown (born 1753), who married Thomas Arnold (1751–1826). Another uncle was Rhode Island Deputy Governor Elisha Brown and a nephew was Nicholas Brown Jr., the philanthropist and the namesake of Brown University.

==Career==

Brown went on to own a successful farming and shipping business with his brothers, Nicholas, Joseph, and Moses Brown. He was active in the slave trade and China trade and invested heavily in privateers during the 1760s through 1780s.

Brown was a leader in the Sons of Liberty and was one of the instigators of the burning of the &quot;Gaspee&quot; in 1772. Along with the Boston Tea Party, this was one of the first violent acts of defiance to the authority of the British Crown which eventually led up to the American Revolution.

In 1775, during the American Revolution, John Brown sold the United States Navy its first ship, the USS &quot;Providence&quot; (previously, the &quot;Katy&quot;). Brown was named as a delegate for Rhode Island to the Continental Congress in 1784–1785 but did not attend.

===Slave trading===

John Brown was also a slave trader and personally owned slaves as well. On March 22, 1794, Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited the making, loading, outfitting, equipping, or dispatching of any ship to be used in human trafficking. Subsequently, on August 5, 1797, John Brown was ordered to forfeit his ship . He was tried in federal court as the first American to be tried under the 1794 law. Brown was acquitted, but did not have his ship returned.

Brown&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade and slavery in Rhode Island are addressed in the official &quot;Response of Brown University to the Report of the Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice.&quot;

===Business interests===
Brown&#x27;s business interests were varied. In addition to the slave trade he was involved in shipbuilding and real estate speculation. He was also a partner (along with his brother Moses Brown and Rhode Island Governor Stephen Hopkins) in the Hope Furnace (located in Hope Village on the border of towns of Scituate and Coventry, RI) which made cannons during the American Revolution and through the War of 1812.

In 1791 Brown founded Providence Bank - the first bank in Rhode Island, and organizer of the Providence South Bridge Company. After various acquisitions over the next 160 years Providence Bank evolved into FleetBoston Financial which, in turn, was absorbed by Bank of America in 2004. Providence Bank is one of the oldest &quot;branches&quot; in Bank of America&#x27;s &quot;family tree&quot; and is, at least arguably, still a &quot;living&quot; corporate entity.

The original Providence Bank building (built in 1774) still stands at 50 South Main Street in Providence and is the corporate office of the Brown &amp; Ives Land Company which is another business which can trace its roots to John Brown.

==American Revolution==
Brown played a leading role in the &quot;Gaspée&quot; Affair of 1772 that increased hostilities between the Thirteen Colonies and the Kingdom of Great Britain and helped catalyze events leading up to the American Revolutionary War. He was an active Federalist and pushed against Rhode Island&#x27;s anti-federalist, &quot;Country Party&quot; in getting Rhode Island to become part of federal union.

&quot;Providence&quot;, the first warship to sail for America&#x27;s Continental Navy, was built in 1768 by John Brown. It was purchased by the colony of Rhode Island after the Royal Navy began attacking Rhode Island&#x27;s shipping lanes. The General Assembly ordered its committee of safety to fit out two ships to defend the lanes, one of which became the &quot;Providence&quot;. The ship, at one time under the command of Continental Navy officer John Paul Jones, went on to participate in 60 engagements and capture 40 British ships before it was dismantled in 1779 to prevent it from falling into British hands.

===Political activity===

Brown was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1798 and served one two-year term from March 4, 1799, to March 3, 1801. The carriage he travelled to Washington in is referred to as &quot;John Brown&#x27;s chariot&quot; and is preserved at the John Brown House in Providence.

===Death and burial===

John Brown died in Providence, Rhode Island on September 20, 1803, and interred in the Brown family plot in the North Burial Ground in Providence.

==Personal life==
He was married to Sarah (Smith) Brown (1738–1825). Together, they had:

* James Brown III (1761–1834) from Rhode Island, who never married, was educated at Harvard University where he graduated in 1780. In 1789, James was elected a member of the Board of Fellows of Brown University, and regularly attended meetings until his death.
* Abigail Brown Francis
* Sarah Brown Herreshoff (1773–1846), who married Charles Frederick Herreshoff (1763–1819), an engineer derived from Germany.
* Alice Brown Mason

===Descendants===
Brown&#x27;s grandson John Brown Francis was later a U.S. Senator and Governor of Rhode Island. His grandson, Charles Frederick Herreshoff (1809–1888), and his sons, James Brown Herreshoff (1834–1930), John Brown Herreshoff (1841–1914), and Nathanael Greene Herreshoff (1848–1938) founded the &quot;Herreshoff Manufacturing Company&quot;, a boatbuilding establishment in Bristol, Rhode Island.

<doc id="698578" wikidata="Q272083" url="?curid=698578" title="Glenda Farrell">
<text>Glenda Farrell (June 30, 1904 – May 1, 1971) was an American actress. Farrell personified the smart and sassy, wisecracking blonde of the Classic Hollywood films. Her career spanned more than 50 years, and she appeared in numerous Broadway plays, films and television series. She won an Emmy Award in 1963 for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her performance as Martha Morrison in the medical drama television series &quot;Ben Casey&quot;.

Farrell began acting on stage as a child and continued with various theatre companies and on Broadway before signing with Warner Bros. A signature 1930s Warner Bros. star, Farrell appeared in films such as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931), &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (1932), &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; (1933) and &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933). Starting with &quot;Smart Blonde&quot; (1937), Farrell played Torchy Blane, a daring female reporter, in a series of popular films which later was credited by comic book writer Jerry Siegel as the inspiration for the DC Comics reporter Lois Lane. After leaving Warner Bros. in 1939, Farrell remained active in film, television and theatre throughout the rest of her career.

==Early life==
Farrell was born in Enid, Oklahoma. Her father, Charles Farrell, was a horse trader of Irish and Cherokee descent. Farrell&#x27;s mother, Wilhelmina &quot;Minnie&quot; of German descent, was the driving force behind her daughter&#x27;s theatre career. Farrell had two brothers, Dick and Gene. After her family moved to Wichita, Kansas, Farrell began acting on stage with a theatrical company at age seven, playing the role of Little Eva in the play &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Farrell&#x27;s mother had never achieved her desire of being an actress, encouraged and supported her daughter&#x27;s acting interests. When her family moved to San Diego, California, a teenage Farrell joined the Virginia Brissac Stock Company. Farrell made the third honor roll in &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Fame and Fortune Contest&quot;. Her picture and biography were featured in the magazine&#x27;s April 1919 issue, which also stated that Farrell had some experience in the chorus, vaudeville, and camp entertainments. Farrell received a formal education at the Mount Carmel Catholic Academy.

==Career==

===1928–1939: Stage and films===

In 1928, Farrell was cast as the lead actress in the play &quot;The Spider&quot; and made her film debut in a minor role in &quot;Lucky Boy&quot;. Farrell moved to New York City in 1929, where she replaced Erin O&#x27;Brien-Moore as Marion Hardy in Aurania Rouverol&#x27;s play &quot;Skidding&quot;. The play later served as the basis for the Andy Hardy film series. By April 1929, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that she had played the role 355 times. Farrell appeared in several other plays, including &quot;Divided Honors&quot;, &quot;Recapture&quot;, and &quot;Love, Honor and Betray&quot; with George Brent, Alice Brady, and Clark Gable.

In 1930, she starred in the comedy short film &quot;The Lucky Break&quot; with Harry Fox and in July 1930, &quot;Film Daily&quot; announced that Farrell had been cast as the female lead, Olga Stassoff, in director Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s gangster film &quot;Little Caesar&quot;. The movie was Farrell&#x27;s first major film role, co-starring Edward G. Robinson and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Afterwards, she returned to Broadway and starred in &quot;On the Spot&quot; at the Forrest Theater. At the time, Farrell conceded that motion pictures offered immense salaries but felt the theatre was the foundation of the actor&#x27;s profession. She appeared in several more plays.

In 1932, Farrell starred in the hit Broadway play &quot;Life Begins&quot;, an episodic drama set entirely in the maternity ward in a hospital. Farrell received rave reviews and notices for her performance as Florette Darien, the professionally sullen chorus girl. Farrell was asked to recreate the role in Warner Bros.&#x27; film adaptation of &quot;Life Begins&quot; later that year. She was also given a seven years contract with the Warner Bros. film studio. Farrell did not return to the stage until 1939.
Farrell appeared in over 30 films in her first five years with Warner Bros., sometimes working on three pictures that were shooting at the same time and managed to transition from one role to another. She co-starred in the Academy-Award nominated films &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (1932) with Paul Muni and &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; (1933) by director Frank Capra. She also appeared in films such as &quot;Girl Missing&quot; (1933), &quot;Little Big Shot&quot; (1935), the musical &quot;Go into Your Dance&quot; (1935) and the comedies &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; (1936) and &quot;High Tension&quot; (1936).

Farrell was close friends with fellow Warner Bros. actress and frequent co-star Joan Blondell. They were paired as a comedy duo throughout the early 1930s in a series of five Warner Bros. movies: &quot;Havana Widows&quot; (1933), &quot;Kansas City Princess&quot; (1934), &quot;Traveling Saleslady&quot; (1935), &quot;We&#x27;re in the Money&quot; (1935) and &quot;Miss Pacific Fleet&quot; (1935). Farrell and Blondell appeared together in a total of nine films.
In 1937, Farrell began starring as Torchy Blane, a fast-talking, wisecracking newspaper reporter. Warner Bros. had started to develop a film adaptation of &quot;MacBride and Kennedy&quot; stories by detective novelist Frederick Nebel. For the film version, Kennedy is changed to a woman named &quot;Torchy&quot; Blane and is in love with MacBride&#x27;s character. Director Frank MacDonald immediately knew whom he wanted for the role of Torchy. Farrell had already proved that she could play hard-boiled reporters in &quot;Mystery of the Wax Museum&quot; (1933) and &quot;Hi, Nellie!&quot; (1934) and was quickly cast with Barton MacLane playing detective Steve McBride in the first film &quot;Smart Blonde&quot; (1937).

&quot;Smart Blonde&quot; was a surprise hit and became a popular second feature with moviegoers. Farrell continued to play Torchy in seven films opposite MacLane between 1937 and 1939. The Torchy series took Farrell&#x27;s popularity to a new level. She was beloved by the moviegoing public and received a huge amount of fan mail for the series. Farrell based her portrayal of the Torchy character on real-life female journalists of the time, stating in her 1969 &quot;Time&quot; interview: &quot;So before I undertook to do the first Torchy, I determined to create a real human being—and not an exaggerated comedy type. I met those [newswomen] who visited Hollywood and watched them work on visits to New York City. They were generally young, intelligent, refined, and attractive. By making Torchy true to life, I tried to create a character practically unique in movies.&quot;

Along with starring in the Torchy Blane series, Farrell appeared in several other films, including &quot;Dance Charlie Dance&quot; (1937), &quot;Exposed &quot;(1938) and &quot;Prison Break&quot; (1938). She also performed in the radio series &quot;Vanity&quot; and &quot;Playhouse&quot; in 1937 and &quot;Manhattan Latin&quot; with Humphrey Bogart in 1938.
Farrell was elected to a one-year term as the honorary mayor of North Hollywood in 1937, beating her competition Bing Crosby and Lewis Stone by a three-to-one margin. Even though it began as a Warner Bros. publicity stunt, Farrell took the job seriously, attending functions, presentations, and ceremonies. She was also put in charge when the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced that it wanted to put sewers along Ventura Highway and started the groundwork for that project.

In 1939, Farrell left Warner Bros. when her contract expired. Several factors resulted in her decision, including feeling Warner Bros. was typecasting her as a newspaper reporter, a pay raise reneged on by Jack Warner, and a desire to return to the theatre. Farrell later told syndicated columnist Bob Thomas in 1952: &quot;There&#x27;s something more satisfying about working in a play. You get that immediate response from the audience, and you feel that your performance is your own. In pictures, you get frustrated because you feel you have no power over what you&#x27;re doing.&quot;

===1939–1969: Television, stage, and films===

In July 1939, Farrell starred in the lead role in the play &quot;Anna Christie&quot; at the Westport Country Playhouse and followed that with a summer stock production of S. N. Behrman&#x27;s play &quot;Brief Moment&quot;. She co-starred with Lyle Talbot and Alan Dinehart in the long-running play &quot;Separate Rooms&quot; at Broadway&#x27;s Plymouth Theater for a successful 613-performance run throughout 1940 and 1941. She appeared in the Broadway plays &quot;The Overtons&quot; in 1945 and &quot;Home is the Hero&quot; by Walter Macken in 1954.

Farrell returned to motion pictures in 1941, starring in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s film noir, &quot;Johnny Eager&quot;. Throughout the 40s, 50s, and 60s, Farrell continued to appear in numerous films: including the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; (1942), &quot;A Night for Crime&quot; (1943), the Western &quot;Apache War Smoke&quot; (1952) and the crime drama &quot;Girls in the Night&quot; (1953). She starred in the 1959 film adaptation of the Broadway play &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; with Fredric March and Kim Novak. Farrell co-starred with her son Tommy Farrell in two comedy films in 1964: &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot; and &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot;.

Farrell made her television debut in 1949 in the anthology series &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;. She appeared in over 40 television series between 1950 and 1969, including &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;. In 1963, Farrell guest-starred in the ABC medical drama series &quot;Ben Casey&quot; as Martha Morrison in the two-part episode &quot;A Cardinal Act of Mercy&quot;. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding performance in a supporting role by an actress.

Farrell briefly retired in 1968 but soon decided to return to acting. Farrell&#x27;s final work in her long career was the Broadway play &quot;Forty Carats&quot;. She was appearing in &quot;Forty Carats&quot; at the Morosco Theatre until ill health forced her to leave the play a few months later. Farrell was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer.

==Personal life==

In 1920, Farrell was hired to do a dance routine at a Navy benefit ball in San Diego. There she met her first husband, Thomas Richards. They were married from 1921 to 1929. Their son, actor Tommy Farrell, was born in 1921. Farrell was engaged to Jack Durant of the comedy duo &quot;Mitchell and Durant&quot; in 1931 but never married him. She later dated screenwriter Robert Riskin and actor Jack Randall.

In 1941, Farrell married Dr. Henry Ross, a major and Army Air Force flight surgeon. The couple met during a performance of the play &quot;Separate Rooms&quot; after Farrell sprained her ankle and was treated backstage by Ross. Ross was a staff surgeon at New York&#x27;s Polyclinic Hospital and West Point graduate, who later served as chief of the public health section on General Eisenhower&#x27;s staff. Farrell and Ross remained married until her death 30 years later. Throughout her life, Farrell was a devout Catholic.

==Death==
In 1971, Farrell died from lung cancer, age 66, at her home in New York City and was interred in the West Point Cemetery in West Point, New York. When Ross, who did not remarry, died in 1991, he was buried with her.

==Legacy==
Comic book writer Jerry Siegel credits Farrell&#x27;s portrayal of Torchy Blane as the inspiration for the fictional Daily Planet reporter and Superman&#x27;s love interest, Lois Lane. Siegel also named June Farrell, one of the characters in his &quot;Funnyman&quot; comic book series, after Farrell.

On February 8, 1960, Farrell received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to motion pictures at 6524 Hollywood Boulevard.

Writer and director Garson Kanin said in a 1971 &quot;New York Times&quot; article: &quot;There are players who create characters; some of the great ones, a single character. More rare are those who, like Glenda, created a type. She invented and developed that made‐tough, uncompromising, knowing, wisecracking, undefeatable blonde. Whether she was the Girl Friend of the star, a cynical secretary, a salesgirl, a worldweary wife, a madam, homesteader, or schoolteacher she was always, relentlessly The Type. She was widely imitated, and lived long enough to see her imitators imitated.&quot;

In 1977, Farrell&#x27;s husband, Dr. Henry Ross, donated 38 acres of land to the Putnam County Land Trust, establishing the Glenda Farrell–Henry Ross Preserve.

<text>Scalping is the act of cutting or tearing a part of the human scalp, with hair attached, from the head, and generally occurred in warfare with the scalp being a trophy. Scalp-taking is considered part of the broader cultural practice of the taking and display of human body parts as trophies, and may have developed as an alternative to the taking of human heads, for scalps were easier to take, transport, and preserve for subsequent display. Scalping independently developed in various cultures in both the Old and New Worlds.

==Europe==
One of the earliest examples of scalping dates back to the mesolithic period, found at a hunter-gatherer cemetery in Sweden. Several human remains from the stone-age Ertebølle culture in Denmark show evidence of scalping. A man found in a grave in the Alvastra pile-dwelling in Sweden had been scalped approximately 5,000 years ago.

Georg Friederici noted that “Herodotus provided the only clear and satisfactory portrayal of a scalping people in the old world” in his description of the Scythians, a nomadic people then located to the north and west of the Black Sea. Herodotus related that Scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder. Then, the warrior would skin the head “by making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull; he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox, and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple, and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief. He hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.”

Ammianus Marcellinus noted the taking of scalps by the Alani in terms quite similar to those used by Herodotus. The Abbé Emmanuel H. D. Domenech referred to the &quot;decalvare&quot; of the ancient Germans and the &quot;capillos et cutem detrahere&quot; of the code of the Visigoths as examples of scalping in early medieval Europe, though some more recent interpretations of these terms relate them to shaving off the hair of the head as a legal punishment rather than scalping.

In England in 1036, Earl Godwin, father of Harold Godwinson, was reportedly responsible for scalping his enemies, among whom was Alfred Aetheling. According to the ancient Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, &#x27;some of them were blinded, some maimed, some scalped. No more horrible deed was done in this country since the Danes came and made peace here&#x27;.

In 1845, mercenary John Duncan observed what he estimated to be 700 scalps taken in warfare and displayed as trophies by a contingent of female soldiers—Dahomey Amazons—employed by the King of Dahomey (present-day Republic of Benin). Duncan noted that these would have been taken and kept over a long period of time and would not have come from a single battle. Although Duncan travelled widely in Dahomey, and described customs such as the taking of heads and the retention of skulls as trophies, nowhere else does he mention scalping.

Occasional instances of scalping of dead Axis troops by Allied military personnel are known from World War II. While many of these instances took place in the Pacific Theater, along with more extreme forms of trophy-hunting (see American mutilation of Japanese war dead), occasional instances are reported in the European Theater as well. One particularly widely reported, although disputed, case involves that of German general Friedrich Kussin, the commandant of the town of Arnhem who was ambushed and killed by British paratroopers in the early stages of Operation Market Garden.

==Asia==
There is physical evidence that scalping was practiced during the Longshan and Erlitou periods in China&#x27;s central plain.

A skull from an Iron Age cemetery in South Siberia shows evidence of scalping. It lends physical evidence to the practice of scalp taking by the Scythians living there.

Some evidence is also found in the Indian Subcontinent. Bhai Taru Singh (
– 1 July 1745) was a prominent Sikh martyr known for sacrificing his life, in the name of protecting Sikh values, by having had his head scalped rather than cutting his hair and converting to Islam.

==Americas==

Scalping in the Americas predominantly arose from the practices of Native American tribes, and was later copied by European colonists on the continent. 

===Techniques===
Specific scalping techniques varied somewhat from place to place, depending on the cultural patterns of the scalper regarding the desired shape, size, and intended use of the severed scalp, and on how the victims wore their hair, but the general process of scalping was quite uniform:They seize the head of the disabled or dead enemy, and placing one of their feet on the neck, twist their left hand in the hair; by this means, having extended the skin that covers the top of the head, they draw out their scalping knives, which are always kept in good order for this cruel purpose, and with a few dextrous strokes take off the part that is termed the scalp. They are so expeditious in doing this, that the whole time required scarcely exceeds a minute.The scalp separated from the skull along the plane of the areolar connective tissue, the fourth (and least substantial) of the five layers of the human scalp. Scalping was not in itself fatal, though it was most commonly inflicted on the gravely wounded or the dead. The earliest instruments used in scalping were stone knives crafted of flint, chert, or obsidian, or other materials like reeds or oyster shells that could be worked to carry an edge equal to the task. Collectively, such tools were also used for a variety of everyday tasks like skinning and processing game, but were replaced by metal knives acquired in trade through European contact. The implement, often referred to as a &quot;scalping knife&quot; in popular American and European literature, was not known as such by Native Americans, a knife being for them just a simple and effective multi-purpose utility tool for which scalping was but one of many uses.

===Intertribal conflict===

There is substantial archaeological evidence of scalping in North America in the pre-Columbian era. Carbon dating of skulls show evidence of scalping as early as 600 AD; some skulls show evidence of healing from scalping injuries, suggesting at least some victims occasionally survived at least several months. Among Plains Indians, it seems to have been practiced primarily as part of intertribal warfare, with scalps only taken of enemies killed in battle. However, author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote, &quot;Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of &#x27;total war, in which civilians are targeted, &quot;for conflicts between modern industrial nations,&quot; the term &quot;closely approaches the state of affairs between the Pawnees, the Sioux, and the Cheyennes. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy&#x27;s territory.&quot;
Many tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the end of the 19th century. Of the approximately 500 bodies at the Crow Creek massacre site, 90 percent of the skulls show evidence of scalping. The event took place &quot;circa&quot; 1325 AD. European colonisation of the Americas increased the incidence of intertribal conflict, and consequently an increase in the prevalence of scalping.

===Colonial wars===
Officials in the English colonies of Connecticut and Massachusetts offered bounties for the heads of killed Indians, and later for just their scalps during the Pequot War. Connecticut authorities specifically reimbursed Mohegans for killing Pequot tribespeople in 1637. Four years later, the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam offered bounties for the heads of Raritans. In 1643, the Iroquois attacked a group of Wyandot fur traders and French carpenters near Montreal, killing and scalping three Frenchmen.

Bounties for Indian captives or their scalps appeared in the legislation of several English colonies during the Susquehannock War (1675–77). The New England Colonies offered bounties to white settlers and Narragansett people in 1675 during King Philip&#x27;s War. By 1692, New France also paid their native allies for scalps of their enemies. In 1697, on the northern frontier of Massachusetts colony, white settler Hannah Duston killed ten of her Abenaki captors during her nighttime escape, presented their ten scalps to the Massachusetts General Court and was rewarded with bounties for two men, two women, and six children, even though colonial authorities had rescinded the law authorizing scalp bounties six months earlier. There were six colonial wars with New England and the Iroquois Confederacy fighting New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy over a 75-year period, starting with King William&#x27;s War in 1688. All sides scalped victims, including noncombatants, during this frontier warfare. Bounty policies originally intended only for Native American scalps were extended to enemy colonists.

Massachusetts created a scalp bounty during King William&#x27;s War in July 1689, and continued doing so during Queen Anne&#x27;s War in 1703. During Father Rale&#x27;s War (1722–1725), on August 8, 1722, Massachusetts put a bounty on native families, paying 100 pounds sterling for the scalps of male Indians aged 12 and over, and 50 pounds sterling for women and children. Ranger John Lovewell is known to have conducted scalp-hunting expeditions, the most famous being the Battle of Pequawket in New Hampshire.

In the 1710s and 1720s, New France engaged in frontier warfare with the Natchez people and the Meskwaki people, during which both sides employed the practice. In response to repeated attacks on British settlers by the French and their native allies during King George&#x27;s War, Massachusetts Governor William Shirley issued a bounty in 1746 to be paid to British-allied Indians for the scalps of French-allied Indian men, women, and children. New York passed a scalp act in 1747.

During Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War and the Seven Years&#x27; War in Nova Scotia and Acadia, French colonists offered payments to Indians for British scalps. In 1749, governor of Nova Scotia Edward Cornwallis created an proclamation which included a bounty for male scalps or prisoners, though no scalps were turned in. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, governor of Nova Scotia Charles Lawrence offered a reward for male Mi&#x27;kmaq scalps in 1756. In 2000, Mi&#x27;kmaq activists argued that this proclamation was still legal in Nova Scotia, though government officials pointed out that it was no longer legal because the bounty was superseded by the Halifax Treaties.

During the French and Indian War, as of June 12, 1755, Massachusetts governor William Shirley was offering a bounty of £40 for a male Indian scalp, and £20 for scalps of females or of children under 12 years old. In 1756, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Robert Morris, in his declaration of war against the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) people, offered &quot;130 Pieces of Eight, for the Scalp of Every Male Indian Enemy, above the Age of Twelve Years,&quot; and &quot;50 Pieces of Eight for the Scalp of Every Indian Woman, produced as evidence of their being killed.&quot;

Although much has been made of the existence of scalp bounties, generally because they have been easily accessible as statutes, little research exists on the numbers of bounties actually paid. Early frontier warfare in forested areas in the era of flintlock muzzle-loading rifles favored tomahawks and knives over firearms because of the long loading time after a shot was fired. Advantage was clearly held by bow, knife, and hatchet. Some states had a history of escalating the payout of bounties offered per scalp, presumably because lower bounties were ineffective and were not worth risking one&#x27;s life in exchange for the payoff. Rising bounties were a measure of bounty system failure.

===American Revolutionary War===
During the American Revolutionary War, British Indian Department official Henry Hamilton was nicknamed the &quot;hair-buyer general&quot; by American Patriots as they believed he encouraged and paid British-allied Natives to scalp Americans. As a result, when Hamilton was captured by American troops, he was treated as a war criminal instead of a prisoner of war. However, American historians have noted that there was no proof that he had ever offered rewards for scalps, and no British officer paid for scalps during the conflict.

However, both sides of the war scalped enemy corpses. The September 13, 1779 journal entry of American Lieutenant William Barton recounted how U.S. troops scalped Native dead during the Sullivan Expedition. British-allied Iroquois also practiced scalping. The most famous case was that of Jane McCrea, whose fiancé was a Loyalist officer. She was abducted by two Iroquois warriors and ultimately scalped and shot. Her death inspired many American colonists to resist a British invasion from Canada, which ended in defeat at the battles of Saratoga.

===Mexico===
During the Apache–Mexico Wars in 1835, the government of the Mexican state of Sonora put a bounty on the Apache which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old. In 1837, the Mexican state of Chihuahua also offered a bounty on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child. Harris Worcester wrote: &quot;The new policy attracted a diverse group of men, including Anglos, runaway slaves led by Seminole John Horse, and Indians — Kirker used Delawares and Shawnees; others, such as Terrazas, used Tarahumaras; and Seminole chief Coacoochee led a band of his own people who had fled from Indian Territory.&quot; Mexico&#x27;s scalp bounties were infamously exploited by the Glanton gang: originally charged with fighting the Apache, the gang later began to take scalps from peaceful Natives and non-Native Mexicans.

===American Civil War===
Some scalping incidents occurred during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. For example, Confederate guerrillas led by &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson were well known for decorating their saddles with the scalps of Union soldiers they had killed. Archie Clement had the reputation of being Anderson&#x27;s “chief scalper”.

===Continued Indian Wars===
In 1851, the U.S. Army displayed Indian scalps in Stanislaus County, California. 

In 1851, the Tehama Massacre occurred in Tehama County, California, wherein U.S. military and citizens razed villages and scalped hundreds of men, women, and children. This attack targeted Native communities specifically, in the villages of Yana, Konkow, Nisenan, Wintu, Nomlaki, Patwin, Yuki, and Maidu.

Scalping also occurred during the Sand Creek Massacre on November 29, 1864, during the American Indian Wars, when a 700-man force of U.S. Army volunteers destroyed the village of Cheyenne and Arapaho in southeastern Colorado Territory, killing and mutilating an estimated 70–163 Native American civilians. An 1867 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that &quot;settlers in a small town in Colorado Territory had recently subscribed $5,000 to a fund ‘for the purpose of buying Indian scalps (with $25 each to be paid for scalps with the ears on)’ and that the market for Indian scalps ‘is not affected by age or sex’.&quot; The article noted this behavior was &quot;sanctioned&quot; by the U.S. federal government, and was modeled on patterns the U.S. had begun a century earlier in the &quot;American East&quot;.

From one writer&#x27;s point of view, it was a &quot;uniquely American&quot; innovation that the use of scalp bounties in the wars against indigenous societies &quot;became an indiscriminate killing process that deliberately targeted Indian non-combatants (including women, children, and infants), as well as warriors.&quot; Some American states such as Arizona paid bounty for enemy Native American scalps.

<text>The Alpine states or Alpine countries are eight countries associated with the Alpine region, as defined by the Alpine Convention of 1991: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland.

==Nations==
# 
# 
# 
# 

==Territory==
The territory includes 83 NUTS 3-level local administrative divisions and about 6,200 municipalities.

In a narrow sense, the term &quot;Alpine states&quot; could be applied to Austria (28.7% of the total area), Italy (27.2%), and France (21.4%), which represent more than 77% of the Alpine territory and more than three quarters of the Alpine population. However, for larger countries like Italy and France, the share of their territory within the Alpine region only amounts to 17% and 7%, respectively. From a strictly national point of view, and with the exception of microstates Liechtenstein and Monaco, the Alps are dominant in only two countries: Austria (65.5% of its territory) and Switzerland (65%).

==Diplomacy==
The diplomatic status between these countries varies depending on their individual relationships with each other. Many of these countries are members of the European Union (EU) and have close diplomatic ties with each other through this regional organization. The EU has helped to facilitate greater cooperation and integration among the Alpine states in various areas, such as trade, transportation, and environmental policy.

There are also several bilateral agreements and treaties between these countries, covering issues such as border security, trade, and cultural exchange. In addition, these countries work together through various regional and international organizations, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.

<doc id="698612" wikidata="Q1194795" url="?curid=698612" title="Maghrebi Arabic">
<text>Maghrebi Arabic, often known as ad-Dārija to differentiate it from Literary Arabic, is a vernacular Arabic dialect continuum spoken in the Maghreb. It includes the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, Hassaniya and Saharan Arabic dialects.

Maghrebi Arabic has a predominantly Semitic and Arabic vocabulary, although it contains a significant number of Berber loanwords, which represent 2–3% of the vocabulary of Libyan Arabic, 8–9% of Algerian and Tunisian Arabic, and 10–15% of Moroccan Arabic. Maghrebi Arabic was formerly spoken in Al-Andalus and Sicily until the 17th and 13th centuries, respectively, in the extinct forms of Andalusi Arabic and Siculo-Arabic. The Maltese language is believed to have its source in a language spoken in Muslim Sicily that ultimately originates from Tunisia, as it contains some typical Maghrebi Arabic areal characteristics.

==Proto-Maghrebi Arabic==

===Phonology===
The common ancestor of Maghrebi Arabic had the same phonology as Modern Standard Arabic, with a few key differences.

&quot;*&quot; From Old Hijazi diphthongs /ay/ and /aw/.

&quot;*&quot; Old Hijazi /ɮˤ/ and /ðˤ/ merged with each other in all varieties of Arabic.

===Vocabulary===
Maghrebi regionalisms are mostly reduced forms of Arabic phrases.

&quot;*&quot;ذَرْوَكْت (*ḏarwakt) &lt; ذَا اَلوَقْت (ḏā al-waqt)

&quot;*&quot;أشكون (*ʔaškōn) &lt; أَيُّ شَيْء كَوْن (*ʔēš *kōn &lt; ʔayy šayʔ kawn)

===Grammar===
Proto-Maghrebi had already lost all nunation and most of the i&#x27;rāb, with the exception of the adverbial accusative, which was unproductive.

An n- prefix is added to the first person singular in some verb forms, which distinguishes maghrebi Arabic from all other varieties of Arabic.

==Name==
&quot;Darija&quot;, &quot;Derija&quot; or &quot;Delja&quot; () means &quot;everyday/colloquial dialect&quot;; it is also rendered as &quot;&quot;, &quot;derija&quot; or &quot;darja&quot;. It refers to any of the varieties of colloquial Maghrebi Arabic. Although it is also common in Algeria and Tunisia to refer to the Maghrebi Arabic varieties directly as languages, similarly it is also common in Egypt and Lebanon to refer to the Mashriqi Arabic varieties directly as languages. For instance, Algerian Arabic would be referred as &quot;Dzayri&quot; (Algerian) and Tunisian Arabic as &quot;Tounsi&quot; (Tunisian), and Egyptian Arabic would be referred as &quot;Masri&quot; (Egyptian) and Lebanese Arabic as &quot;Lubnani&quot; (Lebanese).

In contrast, the colloquial dialects of more eastern Arab countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are usually known as &quot;&quot; (), though Egyptians may also refer to their dialects as &quot;el-logha d-darga&quot;.

== History and origin ==

Maghrebi Arabic can be divided into two lineages in North Africa. One originates from the urban Arabs and dates back to the Arab Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th and 8th centuries, referred to as Pre-Hilalian Arabic. The other stems from the Bedouin Arabic varieties brought in by the Bedouin Arab tribes of Banu Hilal, Banu Sulaym and Ma&#x27;qil in the 11th and 12th centuries, termed as Hilalian Arabic. The Pre-Hilalian varieties were largely bedouinized by the Hilalian migrations in the 11th century, producing hybrid varieties that combined both pre-Hilalian and Hilalian features. This led to the choice of Banu Hilal&#x27;s Arabic as the lingua franca of the Maghreb. This variety, with influences from Berber languages and Punic, gave rise to the modern Arabic varieties in the Maghreb spoken by the vast majority of Maghrebis.

The Arabic language was spread across North Africa throughout the Rashidun and Umayyad conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, during which about 150,000 Arabs settled in the Maghreb. As Arab-led forces established settlements in a triangle encompassing Roman towns and cities such as Tangier, Salé and Walili, Moroccan Arabic began to take form. Arabization was widespread in cities where both Arabs and Berbers lived, as well as Arab centers and surrounding rural areas. Nevertheless, the Arabization process in the countryside remained gradual until the Hilalian invasions of the 11th century.

Maghrebi Arabic originates from the Bedouin Arabic varieties that were introduced to the Maghreb in the 11th century by Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym, who effectively accelerated the Arabization of a great part of the Berbers. Sources estimate that around 1 million Arabs migrated to the Maghreb in the 11th century. Their impact was profound and reshaped the demographic situation and living conditions across the Maghreb. They played a major role in spreading Bedouin Arabic to rural areas such as the countryside and steppes, and as far as the southern areas near the Sahara.

==Characteristics==
The varieties of Maghrebi Arabic form a dialect continuum. The degree of mutual intelligibility is high between geographically adjacent dialects (such as local dialects spoken in Eastern Morocco and Western Algeria or Eastern Algeria and North Tunisia or South Tunisia and Western Libya), but lower between dialects that are further apart, e.g. between Moroccan and Tunisian Darija. Conversely, Moroccan Darija and particularly Algerian Derja cannot be easily understood by Eastern Arabic speakers (from Egypt, Sudan, Levant, Iraq, and Arabian peninsula) in general.

Maghrebi Arabic continues to evolve by integrating new French or English words, notably in technical fields, or by replacing old French and Italian/Spanish ones with Modern Standard Arabic words within some circles; more educated and upper-class people who code-switch between Maghrebi Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic have more French and Italian/Spanish loanwords, especially the latter came from the time of al-Andalus. Maghrebi dialects all use &quot;n-&quot; as the first-person singular prefix on verbs, distinguishing them from Levantine dialects and Modern Standard Arabic.

===Relationship with Modern Standard Arabic and Berber languages===
Modern Standard Arabic () is the primary language used in the government, legislation and judiciary of countries in the Maghreb. Maghrebi Arabic is mainly a spoken and vernacular dialect, although it occasionally appears in entertainment and advertising in urban areas of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In Algeria, where Maghrebi Arabic was taught as a separate subject under French colonization, some textbooks in the dialect exist but they are no longer officially endorsed by the Algerian authorities. Maghrebi Arabic has a mostly Semitic Arabic vocabulary. It contains Berber loanwords, which represent 2–3% of the vocabulary of Libyan Arabic, 8–9% of Algerian and Tunisian Arabic, and 10–15% of Moroccan Arabic. The dialect may also possess a substratum of Punic.

===Latin substratum===
Additionally, Maghrebi Arabic has a Latin substratum, which may have been derived from the African Romance that was used as an urban lingua franca during the Byzantine Empire period.
in morphology, this substratum is considered the origin of the plural noun morphemes &quot;-əsh&quot;/&quot;-osh&quot; that are common in northern Moroccan dialects, and probably the loss of gender in the second person singular of personal pronouns verbs, for example in Andalusian Arabic.
The lexicon contains many loanwords from Latin, e.g. Moroccan/Algerian/Tunisian from (this could also be borrowed from Spanish ); from and from through Berber .

===Relationship with other languages===
Maghrebi Arabic speakers frequently borrow words from French (in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), Spanish (in northern Morocco and northwestern Algerian) and Italian (in Libya and Tunisia) and conjugate them according to the rules of their dialects with some exceptions (like passive voice for example). As it is not always written, there is no standard and it is free to change quickly and to pick up new vocabulary from neighboring languages. This is comparable to the evolution of Middle English after the Norman conquest.

<doc id="698614" wikidata="Q1544656" url="?curid=698614" title="Green room">
<text>In show business, the green room is the space in a theatre, or a similar venue, that functions as a waiting room and lounge for performers before, during, and after a performance or show when they are not engaged on stage. Green rooms typically have seating for the performers, such as upholstered chairs and sofas.

The origin of the term is often ascribed to such rooms historically being painted green. Modern green rooms need not necessarily adhere to a specifically green colour scheme, though the theatrical tradition of the name remains.

Some English theatres contained several green rooms, each ranked according to the status, fame, and salary of the actor: one could be fined for using a green room above one&#x27;s station.

==Possible sources of the term==
As often in etymological questions, the precise origins of a term are difficult to establish. This has led to many folk-etymological hypotheses and claims for high-profile terms such as &quot;green room&quot;.

One of the oldest stories is that London&#x27;s Blackfriars Theatre (1599) included a room behind the scenes, where the actors waited to go on stage, which happened to be painted green, and was called &quot;the green room&quot;. A later renovation of London&#x27;s Cockpit-in-Court theatre in 1662 included a green baize dressing room, which has also been suggested as the origin of the term. It has also been theorised that such waiting rooms were originally painted green to &quot;relieve the eyes from the glare of the stage.&quot; On the other hand, early stage lighting was by candlelight and later by gaslight, so the &quot;glare&quot; might well be apocryphal, a modern reference to bright stage lighting.

Richard Southern, in his studies of medieval theatre in the round, states that in this period the acting area was referred to as &#x27;the green&#x27;. This central space, often grass-covered, was used by the actors, while the surrounding space and circular banks were occupied by the spectators; Southern states that &#x27;the green&#x27; has been a traditional actors&#x27; term for the stage ever since. Even in proscenium arch theatres, there was a tradition that a green stage cloth should be used for a tragedy. The green room could thus be considered the transition room on the way to the green/stage. Technical staff at some West End theatres (such as the London Coliseum) still refer to the stage as &#x27;the green&#x27;.

It is sometimes said that the term &#x27;green room&#x27; was a response to limelight, though the name is merely a coincidence – &quot;limelight&quot; refers to calcium oxide, not to the fruit or colour. Furthermore, limelight was invented in 1820 and the term &quot;green room&quot; was used many years prior to that. The term &#x27;green room&#x27; is also attributed to the makeup worn by actors; long before modern makeup was invented, the actors had to apply makeup before a show and allow it to set up or cure before performing. Until the makeup was cured, it was &#x27;green&#x27;, and people were advised to sit quietly in the &#x27;green room&#x27; until such time as the makeup was stable enough for performing.

It is possible that &#x27;green room&#x27; might be a corruption of &#x27;scene room&#x27;, the room where scenery was stored which doubled as the actors&#x27; waiting and warm-up room. Many actors also experience nervous anxiety before a performance, and one of the symptoms of nervousness is nausea. As a person who feels nauseous is often said to look &quot;green&quot;, suggesting that the &#x27;green room&#x27; is the place where the nervous actors wait. Comedian and dancer Max Wall attributes the phrase to Cockney rhyming slang, where &#x27;greengage&#x27; is &#x27;stage&#x27;, therefore &#x27;greengage room&#x27; is &#x27;stage room&#x27;; like most rhyming slang, the term was shortened, hence &#x27;&quot;green&quot; room&#x27;. Rhyming slang can be traced only as early as the 1840s, whereas the phrase &quot;green room&quot; predates this by several centuries, making such an etymology unlikely.

===&quot;Tiring houses&quot;===

In Shakespeare&#x27;s day, the actors waited in a &quot;tiring house&quot; probably because actors were attired (put on or changed costumes) in this space. Here it is mentioned by Peter Quince as he plans for his acting troupe to rehearse in the woods:

Samuel Pepys mentions these locations at the Drury Lane Theatre Royal in 1667:

==Other mentions==
* Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s Restoration comedy, &quot;A True Widow&quot; (1678), mentions in Act Four: Stanmore : &quot;No madam: Selfish, this Evening, in a green Room, behind the Scenes, was before-hand with me...&quot;
* The term &quot;green room&quot; is mentioned in Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love Makes a Man&quot; (1701). &quot;I do know London pretty well, and the Side-box, Sir, and behind the Scenes; ay, and the Green-Room, and all the Girls and Women~Actresses there.&quot;
*In his &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; (1791), James Boswell mentions visits by his subject to the Green Room at the Drury Lane Theatre.
* In 1792, Joseph Haslewood published a collection of memoirs of the actors and actresses of the London theatres entitled &quot;The Secret History of the Green-Room&quot;, while 1796 saw the first edition of John Roach&#x27;s similarly themed &quot;Authentic Memoirs of the Green-Room&quot;.
* In the Jane Austen novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814), when the Bertram children convert the billiard room into a theatre, Tom Bertram notes, &quot;And my father&#x27;s room will be an excellent green-room. It seems to join the billiard room on purpose.&quot;
* In the 1853 Charlotte Brontë novel &quot;Villette&quot; the narrator refers to the green-room when preparing for a performance in an amateur play.
* Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s first book comically describes his stint in English theatre during the late 1870s. &quot;There was no green room. There never had been a green room. I never saw a green room, except in a play, though I was always on the lookout for it.&quot;
* The green room is mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. &quot;When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill.&quot;
* Within the context of international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the &quot;Green Room meeting&quot; refers to a process in which ambassadors seek consensus informally under the chairmanship of the Director-General. &quot;Green Room meetings often run until the early hours of the morning and can stretch out for days. They can also be tense and dramatic settings in which nerves are taut and tempers evident.&quot; The Director-General meeting room at the WTO headquarters Centre William Rappard is called the Green Room since the time the building was occupied by the International Labour Office.

<doc id="698616" wikidata="Q1623463" url="?curid=698616" title="Chinese knotting">
<text>Chinese knotting, also known as  (), is a Chinese folk art with ties to Buddhism and Taoism. A Chinese knot is made from a single length of cord that is woven into different shapes, with each shape having a symbolic meaning. The most common color used in Chinese knotting is red, a color associated with luck in Chinese culture, although any color can be used. Charms, beads, and jade are sometimes incorporated into a Chinese knot. It is believed that Chinese knotting originated for recording information and exchanging messages before writing was commonplace. Traditionally, Chinese knots acted as good-luck charms to ward off evil spirits. Chinese knots are used today to decorate homes during festivities and are also commonly seen in traditional jade jewellery and traditional Chinese clothing.

== Characteristics ==

Chinese knots come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They are made from a single cord and are often double-layered and symmetrical in all directions. Satin cording is the most widely used material, especially when the knotting is done for clothing and jewellery; however, cotton, parachute cord, and other materials are frequently used as well. Knots are often paired with tassels, which are created separately and then incorporated into the main work.
Chinese knots are created in a variety of colors such as gold, green, blue, or black, though the most commonly used color is red, which symbolizes good luck and prosperity.

=== Types and shapes ===
Chinese knot scholar Lydia Chen lists eleven basic types of Chinese decorative knotwork. Complex knots are constructed from repeating or combining basic knots. 
== History ==
Archaeological studies indicate that the art of tying knots dates back to prehistoric times. Discoveries include 100,000-year-old bone needles used for sewing and bodkins used to untie knots. Due to the delicate nature of the medium, little evidence of prehistoric Chinese knotting exists today. Some of the earliest evidence of knotting has been preserved on bronze vessels from the Warring States period (481–221 BCE), Buddhist carvings from the Northern dynasties period (317–581), and on silk paintings from the Western Han period (206 BCE – 9 CE).

===Recordkeeping===

Archaeological and literary evidence indicate that knots were used in China as a method of keeping records, especially to assist in governance. The practice had some similarities to the Incan practice of quipu. Several works of classical Chinese literature make reference to it. The &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; (ca. 400 BCE) alludes to the practice in chapter 80. As translated by Wing-tsit Chan:

The &quot;Yi Jing&quot;, &quot;Xi Ci&quot; II (ca. 168 BCE), describes the practice:

The Eastern Han (25–220 CE) scholar Zheng Xuan, who annotated the , wrote that:

The chapter of Tubo (Tibet) in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; says:

=== Ancient totem ===

In addition to their use in recording, knots became a totem and belief motif. A double coin knot pattern painting on a silk banner was discovered by archaeologists in the Mawangdui tombs (206 BCE – CE 9). The pattern is of intertwined dragons forming a double coin knot in the middle of the fabric painting. The upper part of the fabric painting depicts the ancient deities Fuxi and Nüwa, the initiators of marriage in China, from whom many ancient poems derive &quot;love&quot; as a meaning of the double coin knot. There is evidence from the 3,000-year-old Yinxu oracle bone script that knots were recognized as symbols rather than for functional use.

===Decorative art===

According to Lydia Chen, the earliest tangible evidence of knots as a decorative motif is on a small high-stemmed square pot from the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), which is now displayed in the Shanxi Museum. However, archaeology research has found that the earliest decorative knot artifact in China can be traced back to 4000 years ago, when a three-row rattan knotting of a double coin knot was excavated from Liangzhu ruins.

Knots gradually evolved into a distinct decorative art in China, beginning with the use of ribbon knotting and decorative knots on clothing during the Spring and Autumn period. This is attested in the , where it is written that:

Chinese knotting was thus derived from the culture. The Chinese word &quot;Lào&quot; is an ancient Chinese term for knots, and it was customary to tie a knot at the waist with silk or cotton ribbon.

==== Sui to Ming dynasties ====
The Sui and Tang dynasties (581–906 CE) saw the first peak of the &quot;Lào zi&quot; culture when basic knots, such as the Swastika knot and the round brocade knot, became popular adornments on garments, both among the nobility and the commoners. Knots were cherished not only as symbols and tools, but also as an essential part of everyday life to decorate and express thoughts and feelings.

In the Tang and Song dynasty (960–1279 CE), the love-based knot became an important symbol, as evidenced in many of the poems, novels, and paintings of the era. In the memoir () written by Meng Yuanlao, it is observed that in the traditional wedding custom, a Concentric knot needed to be held by the bride and groom. Other ancient poems used the Concentric knot to portray love, such as Luo Binwang&#x27;s poem:

It was also mentioned in a poem written by Huang Tingjian:

The most famous poem about the Love knot was written by Meng Jiao in ( – ).

The phenomenon of knot-tying continued to steadily evolve over thousands of years with the development of more sophisticated techniques and increasingly intricate woven patterns. During the Song and Yuan dynasties (960–1368), the Pan Chang knot, today&#x27;s most recognizable Chinese knot, became popular. Much artwork evidence has also shown the knots as clothing decoration during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644); for instance, in Tang Yin&#x27;s artwork, a knotting ribbon is clearly shown.

==== Qing dynasty ====
During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Chinese knotting evolved from folklore to an acceptable art form in Chinese society. The &quot;Lào zi&quot; culture again became popular during the Qing dynasty. During that time, basic knots were widely used to embellish everyday objects such as , sachets, purses, fan tassels, spectacle cases, and rosaries, and the single knot technique was extended into complicated knots.

According to the Chinese classical novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, the &quot;Lào zi&quot; was developed and spread between the middle and upper nobility, who used &quot;Lào zi&quot; as a way to express love and luck between family members, lovers, and friends. It was also a form of honorable craftsmanship studied and created by maids in the Imperial Palace. As written in the (), when knotting, the maids of Ci Xi were able to quickly produce many different knots.

==== Republic of China ====
There was little development of knotting during the Republic of China (1912–1949). Simpler knots were popular, for example the &quot;pan kou&quot;, which had been developed before the Qing dynasty, used knot button ornaments designed particularly for the cheongsam in this period.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===

Knowledge and interest in Chinese knotting had declined considerably by the 1970s, when Lydia Chen helped bring about a renewal of interest in the art form through the Chinese Knotting Promotion Center. Chinese knotting has since become a popular symbol and souvenir in festivals and commodity markets.

The use of on clothing and knots as a folk craft remains alive in China.

== Influences and derivatives ==

===Japan===
The knot-tying tradition in Japan is called , a term composed of the words , meaning &quot;flower&quot;, and , meaning &quot;knot&quot;.

The is a legacy of the Tang dynasty of China, when a Japanese Emperor in the 7th century was so impressed by Chinese knots which were used to tie a gift from the Chinese that he started to encourage Japanese people to adopt the practice.

Japanese knots are more austere, formal, simple, and structurally looser than the Chinese knots. In function, Japanese knots are more decorative than functional. With a greater emphasis on the braids that are used to create the knots, Japanese knotting tends to focus on individual knots.

===Korea===
In Korea, decorative knot work is known as (), often referred as Korean knotwork or Korean knots in English.

The Korean knotting techniques is believed to originate from China, from which Korean knots evolved into its own culture in terms of design, color, and incorporation of local characteristics. The origins of date back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea in the first century CE. articles were first used at religious ceremonies.

A wall painting from 357 CE found in Anak, Hwanghae Province, now in North Korea, indicates that silk was the primary medium at the time. Decorative cording was used on silk dresses, to ornament swords, to hang personal items from belts for the aristocracy, and in rituals, where it continues now in contemporary wedding ceremonies. Korean knotwork is differentiated from Korean embroidery. is still a commonly practiced traditional art, especially among the older generations.

The most basic knot in is called the (or the &quot;double connection knot&quot;). The knot is used at the start and end of most knot projects. There are approximately 33 basic Korean knots which vary according to the region they come from. The tassel is noteworthy as the most representative work familiar to Westerners, and often purchased as souvenirs for macramé-style wall-hangings.

<doc id="698618" wikidata="Q954437" url="?curid=698618" title="Tommy Flowers">
<text>Thomas Harold Flowers MBE (22 December 1905 – 28 October 1998) was an English engineer with the British General Post Office. During World War II, Flowers designed and built Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable electronic computer, to help decipher encrypted German messages.

==Early life==
Flowers was born at 160 Abbott Road, Bromley-by-Bow, in what was then the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, on 22 December 1905, the son of a bricklayer. He came from an impoverished working class background and his grandmother had been a charwoman. He later recalled that as children &quot;we were taught to be frugal in everything&quot;.

Whilst undertaking an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, he took evening classes at the University of London to earn a degree in electrical engineering. In 1926, he joined the telecommunications branch of the General Post Office (GPO), moving to the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in Middlesex in 1930.

In 1935, Flowers and Eileen Margaret Green were married. The couple later had two children, John and Kenneth.

From 1934 onward, he explored the use of electronics in telephone exchanges. By 1939, his design of equipment using 3000 to 4000 valves was in limited operation for (say) 1000 lines at an exchange with each line having three or four valves. Note that this was for (amplified) long distance or trunk circuits between exchanges (central offices), using in-band signalling with switching at each end carried out by electromechanical switches or operators. As Flowers remarked, at the outbreak of war “he was possibly the only person in Britain who realised that valves could be used reliably on a large scale for high-speed computing. He was convinced that an all-electronic system was possible. A background in switching electronics would prove crucial for his computer designs.

==World War II==
Flowers&#x27; first contact with wartime codebreaking came in February 1941 when his director, W. Gordon Radley, was asked for help by Alan Turing, who was working at Bletchley Park, the government codebreaking establishment, north west of London in Buckinghamshire. Turing wanted Flowers to build a counter for the relay-based Bombe machine, which Turing had developed to help decrypt German Enigma codes.

The &quot;Counter&quot; project was abandoned but Turing was impressed with Flowers&#x27;s work, and in February 1943 introduced him to Max Newman who was leading the effort to automate part of the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. This was a high-level German code generated by a teletypewriter in-line cipher machine, the Lorenz SZ40/42, one of their (secret writer) systems, called &quot;Tunny&quot; (tuna fish) by the British. It was a much more complex system than Enigma; the decoding procedure involved trying so many possibilities that it was impractical to do by hand. Flowers and Frank Morrell (also at Dollis Hill) designed the Heath Robinson, in an attempt to automate the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz SZ-40/42 cipher machine.

===Colossus computer===
Flowers proposed a more sophisticated alternative, using an electronic system, which his staff called Colossus, using perhaps 1,800 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) instead of 150 and having only one paper tape instead of two (which required synchronisation) by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Because the most complicated previous electronic device had used about 150 valves, some were sceptical that the system would be reliable. Flowers countered that the British telephone system used thousands of valves and was reliable because the electronics were operated in a stable environment with the circuitry on all the time. The Bletchley management were not convinced and merely encouraged Flowers to proceed on his own. He did so at the Post Office Research Labs, using some of his own funds to build it. Flowers had first met (and got on with) Turing in 1939 but was treated with disdain by Gordon Welchman, because of his advocacy of valves rather than relays. Welchman preferred the views of Wynn-Williams and Keene of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) who had designed and constructed the Bombe and wanted Radley and &quot;Mr Flowers of Dollis Hill&quot; removed from work on Colossus for &quot;squandering good valves&quot;.

Despite the success of Colossus, the Heath Robinson approach was still valuable for solving certain problems. The final development of the concept was a machine called Super Robinson that was designed by Tommy Flowers. This one could run four tapes and was used for running depths and &quot;cribs&quot; or known-plaintext attack runs. On 2 June 1943, Flowers was made a member of the Order of the British Empire.

Flowers gained full backing for his project from the director of the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, W. G. Radley. With the highest priority for acquisition of parts, Flowers&#x27;s team at Dollis Hill built the first machine in eleven months. It was immediately dubbed &#x27;Colossus&#x27; by the Bletchley Park staff for its immense proportions. The Mark 1 Colossus operated five times faster and was more flexible than the previous system, named Heath Robinson, which used electro-mechanical switches. The first Mark 1, with 1500 valves, ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943; it was delivered to Bletchley Park in January 1944 where it was assembled and began operation in early February. The algorithms used by Colossus were developed by W. T. Tutte and his team of mathematicians. Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz cipher SZ42 machine.
In anticipation of a need for additional computers, Flowers was already working on Colossus Mark 2 which would employ 2,400 valves. The first Mark 2 went into service at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944 and immediately produced vital information for the imminent D-Day landings planned for Monday 5 June (postponed 24 hours by bad weather). Flowers later described a crucial meeting between Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff on 5 June, during which a courier entered and handed Eisenhower a note summarising a Colossus decrypt. This confirmed that Adolf Hitler wanted no additional troops moved to Normandy, as he was still convinced that the preparations for the Normandy landings were a feint. Handing back the decrypt, Eisenhower announced to his staff, &quot;We go tomorrow&quot;. Earlier, a report from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel on the western defences was decoded by Colossus and revealed that one of the sites chosen as the drop site for a US parachute division was the base for a German tank division, so the site was changed.

Ten Colossi were completed and used during the Second World War in British decoding efforts and an eleventh was ready for commissioning at the end of the war. All but two were dismantled at the end of the war, &quot;The remaining two were moved to a British Intelligence department, GCHQ in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where they may have played a significant part in the codebreaking operations of the Cold War&quot;. They were finally decommissioned in 1959 and 1960.

==Post-war work and retirement==
After the war, Flowers received little recognition for his contribution to cryptanalysis. Flowers was left in debt after the war after using his own personal funds to build Colossus. The government granted him £1,000 payment which did not cover Flowers&#x27; personal investment in the equipment; he shared much of the money amongst the staff who had helped him build and test Colossus. Flowers applied for a loan from the Bank of England to build another machine like Colossus but was denied the loan because the bank did not believe that such a machine could work. He could not argue that he had already designed and built many of these machines because his work on Colossus was covered by the Official Secrets Act. He remained at the Post Office Research Station where he was Head of the Switching Division. He and his group pioneered work on all-electronic telephone exchanges, completing a basic design by about 1950, which led on to the Highgate Wood Telephone Exchange. He was also involved in the development of ERNIE. In 1964, he became head of the advanced development at Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd., where he continued to develop electronic telephone switching including a pulse amplitude modulation exchange, retiring in 1969.

It was not until the 1970s that Flowers&#x27; work in computing was fully acknowledged. His family had known only that he had done some &#x27;secret and important&#x27; work.

In 1976, he published &quot;Introduction to Exchange Systems&quot;, a book on the engineering principles of telephone exchanges.

Flowers died in 1998 aged 92, leaving a wife and two sons.

===Honours===
* 1973: Awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by Newcastle University.
* 1983: The first winner of the Martlesham Medal in recognition of his achievements in computing.
* 1993: Received a certificate from Hendon College, having completed a basic course in information processing on a personal computer.

==Legacy==

Flowers is commemorated at the Post Office Research Station site, which became a housing development, with the main building converted into a block of flats and an access road called Flowers Close. He was honoured by London Borough of Tower Hamlets, where he was born. An Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centre for young people, the Tommy Flowers Centre, opened there in November 2010. The centre has closed but the building is now the Tommy Flowers Centre, part of the Tower Hamlets Pupil Referral Unit. In 2023, English Heritage placed a blue plaque here in his honour.

In September 2012, his wartime diary was put on display at Bletchley Park. A road in Kesgrave, near the current BT Research Laboratories, is named Tommy Flowers Drive.

On 12 December 2013, 70 years after he created Colossus, his legacy was honoured with a memorial commissioned by British Telecom (BT), successor to Post Office Telephones. The life-size bronze bust, designed by James Butler, was unveiled by Trevor Baylis at Adastral Park, BT&#x27;s research and development centre in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, Suffolk. BT also began a computer science scholarship and award in his name.

On 29 September 2016, BT opened the Tommy Flowers Institute for ICT training at Adastral Park to support the development of postgraduates transferring into industry. The institute focuses on bringing ICT-sector organisations together with academic researchers to solve some of the challenges facing UK businesses, exploring areas such as cybersecurity, big data, autonomics and converged networks. The launch event was attended by professors from Cambridge, Oxford, East Anglia, Essex, Imperial, UCL, Southampton, Surrey, and Lancaster as well as representatives from the National Physical Laboratory, Huawei, Ericsson, CISCO, ARM and ADVA.

In 2018, a room in the newly refurbished Institution of Engineering and Technology in London was named the Flowers Room.

===Colossus rebuild===
A functioning Colossus Mark II was rebuilt by a team of volunteers led by Tony Sale between 1993 and 2008. It is on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.

Flowers knew that Sale was rebuilding a MKII version, describing the design and construction which was instrumental in its reconstruction.

<text>Barbara Elaine &quot;Bonnie&quot; Wood Graham (née Ford; June 26, 1923 – June 3, 1955) was an American criminal convicted of murder. She was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin Prison on the same day as two convicted accomplices, Jack Santo and Emmett Perkins, all of whom were involved in a robbery that led to the murder of an elderly widow. Nicknamed &quot;Bloody Babs&quot; by the press, Graham was the third woman in California to be executed by gas.

Her story of adult criminal activity is told in the highly fictionalized 1958 film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;, in which she was portrayed by Susan Hayward, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Graham was born Barbara Elaine Ford in Oakland, California to Hortense Wood from Santa Cruz, who earned her living through prostitution. On February 23, 1925, Hortense, still unwed, gave birth to a second daughter, Claire Elizabeth. On October 10, 1929, at the age of 23, Hortense married Joseph Wood Sr. in Alameda. Hortense, Barbara and Claire all changed their surnames to Wood. Hortense and Joseph&#x27;s son, Joseph Robert Wood Jr., was born on March 27, 1930; however Joseph Sr. died on January 19, 1930, at the age of 28, before his son&#x27;s birth. Hortense was of Portuguese (Azorean) descent on her father&#x27;s side, the original family name having been Furtado.

When Graham was two, her mother, who was still in her late teens, was arrested and sent to reform school and Graham was placed in foster care in which she alleged that she was beaten and treated poorly. Upon release at age 21, Hortense refused to allow Graham to live with her. Graham was raised by strangers and extended family and, although she was intelligent, she had a limited education. As a teenager, she was arrested for vagrancy and sentenced to serve time at Ventura State School for Girls, the same reform school where her mother had been.

Released from reform school in 1939, Graham tried to make a new start for herself. She married Harry Kielhamer (1913–1993), a U.S. Coast Guardsman, in 1940, and enrolled in a business college and soon had her first two children. The marriage was not a success and, by 1942, she was divorced. Harry Kielhamer was awarded custody of their two sons. Over the next several years, she was married twice more, but each of these attempts at a more traditional lifestyle failed.

After this string of failures, Graham is said to have become a worker in the sex trade, as her mother had before her: reportedly, during World War II, she plied her trade as what was known in some circles as a &quot;seagull&quot;, or a prostitute who &quot;flocked&quot; in pairs or groups near naval bases. It is supposed that Graham began working near the Oakland Army Base, Oakland Naval Supply Depot, and Alameda Naval Air Station. In 1942, she and other &quot;seagulls&quot; traveled to Long Beach, California and San Diego. She was arrested on vice charges in these naval cities and in San Pedro, California. At 22, with her good looks, red hair, and sex appeal, she worked for a time in San Francisco for a brothel madam named Sally Stanford. She soon became involved in gambling and illegal drug circles, cultivating a number of friends who were ex-convicts and known career criminals. She served a five-year sentence for perjury as a false alibi witness for two petty criminals, serving her sentence at the California Women&#x27;s State Prison at Tehachapi, California. After her stint in state prison, Graham moved to Reno, Nevada and then Tonopah, Nevada. She obtained work in a hospital and as a waitress, but soon got on a bus for Los Angeles. There, she got a room on Hollywood Boulevard and returned to prostitution. In 1953, she married Henry Graham, who worked as a bartender at one of her frequent haunts. With him she had a third child, named Tommy.

==Murder of Mabel Monohan==
Henry Graham was addicted to illegal drugs and known as a hardened but low-level criminal. Through him, Barbara met his friends Jack Santo and Emmett &quot;The Weasel&quot; Perkins, both with criminal records. She started an affair with Perkins, who told her about a 64-year-old widow, Mabel Monohan, who was alleged to keep a large amount of cash and jewelry in her home in Burbank, California.

Monohan was a retired vaudeville performer who had previously worked the Keith-Albee circuit. Her ex-son-in-law was 74-year-old Luther B. Scherer (1879–1957), a multi-millionaire who was well known through his ownership of various gambling clubs in locations such as Palm Springs and casinos in Las Vegas. It is speculated that he had deep ties to various crime syndicates. Monahan&#x27;s daughter Iris had divorced Scherer two years prior and received the Burbank residence in the divorce settlement. Iris shortly thereafter married a different man and moved to New York, leaving her mother, Mabel Monohan, to reside in their former home. Monohan and Scherer had remained close friends after the divorce and their continued friendship piqued public interest, gossip, and rumors that would later prove deadly. One rumor that was widely circulated amongst criminals and in local bars was that Scherer, due to his deep trust of Monohan, had left $100,000 ($1,044,292 value in 2022) cash stashed in a safe within the residence.

The following account is based on Baxter Shorter&#x27;s confession and John True&#x27;s witness testimony:

On March 8, 1953, Graham had dinner in the San Fernando Valley with Perkins, Santo, True, and Shorter, a safe-cracker. Shorter stated that he initially did not want Graham to participate because she was a &quot;dame&quot; but Perkins convinced him that it was the only way Monohan would open the front door.

On the evening of March 9, 1953, Graham reportedly gained entry by knocking on the door and asked to use Monohan&#x27;s phone due to car trouble. Once Monohan opened the door for Graham, Perkins, Santo, and True came in behind her, followed later by Shorter. Shorter claimed that when he entered the home Monohan was already bleeding and her mouth was gagged. The gang tore up Monohan&#x27;s home looking for the safe, money and/or jewels to no avail. True stated that Graham handed a gun to Perkins and told him to &quot;Knock her out!&quot; Shorter claimed that at this point he threw Perkins to the floor and convinced True to remove the gag because he noticed Monohan was having trouble breathing. True did not mention these events and stated that Graham began to viciously beat Monohan. After the gang left, Santo assumed Monohan was dead. However Shorter, once alone, purportedly called for help from a pay phone. The address given to the operator was incorrect and Monohan was discovered two days later by her gardener.

The robbery attempt was a futile effort as nothing of value was found in the house. They would later learn at trial that $15,000 in jewels and valuables ($156,630 value in 2022) was located in a purse in the closet. Monohan&#x27;s daughter Iris offered a $5,000 ($52,210 value in 2022) reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her mother&#x27;s murderer(s).

==Arrest and conviction==

On March 26, 1953, police arrested and questioned five men in connection with murder of Monohan. Three were known associates of L.A. gangster Mickey Cohen, along with another man and Shorter. All of the men knew Monohan through Scherer; however, they were all released due to lack of evidence.

Shorter, who was shaken at the thought of going to the gas chamber should the police figure out his involvement, volunteered to turn state&#x27;s evidence and gave the police details of the Monohan murder and attempted robbery. He stated that he had seen Perkins hit Monohan with the gun and that he was shaken having witnessed the murder. However, Shorter&#x27;s statement was leaked and he was later kidnapped and murdered by Perkins and Santo after his release from police custody shortly after his confession.

Upon hearing of Shorter&#x27;s disappearance and probable death, William Upshaw, a convicted felon, volunteered to testify before the grand jury. Upshaw testified that he had been in the car with Barbara Graham, Perkins, Santo, True, and Shorter the night prior to the murder as the group conducted surveillance on Monohan&#x27;s home and ran through the robbery plans. He stated that he decided not to participate out of fear of retaliation from &quot;Tutor&quot; Scherer. Subsequently, John True agreed to become a state witness in exchange for immunity from prosecution. In court, True testified against Graham, who continually protested her innocence.

The press nicknamed Graham &quot;Bloody Babs&quot;, reflecting the public disgust for her alleged actions. Having no alibi, Graham doomed her own defense when she accepted another inmate&#x27;s offer to pay $25,000 () to the inmate and &quot;a friend&quot; who would provide a false alibi. The inmate, however, was working to reduce her own sentence, and the &quot;friend&quot;, who offered to say he was with Graham the night of the murder, was a police officer. Meeting with Graham to plan the alibi story, he insisted that she admit to him that she had indeed been at the scene of the crime. The officer was recording the conversation. This attempt to suborn perjury, plus the recorded admission that she indeed had been at the scene of the widow Monohan&#x27;s senselessly violent murder, abutted by her previous perjury conviction, completely destroyed Graham&#x27;s credibility in court. When questioned about her actions at the trial, she said, &quot;Oh, have you ever been desperate? Do you know what it means not to know what to do?&quot;

Graham was convicted, while the informant was immediately released from jail, and the informant&#x27;s sentence commuted to time served. The prosecution was led by district attorney J. Miller Leavy.

==Appeals and execution==
Graham, Santo, and Perkins were all sentenced to death for the robbery and murder. Graham appealed her sentence while at the California Institution for Women in Chino, California. Her appeals failed, and on June 2, 1955, she was transferred to San Quentin State Prison. On June 3, 1955, she was scheduled to be executed at 10:00 a.m., but that was stayed by California governor Goodwin J. Knight until 10:45 a.m. At 10:43 a.m., Knight stayed the execution until 11:30 a.m. Graham protested, &quot;Why do they torture me? I was ready to go at ten o&#x27;clock.&quot; At 11:28 a.m. she was led from her cell and strapped in the gas chamber; she requested a blindfold so she would not have to look at the observers. Her last words were &quot;Good people are always so sure they&#x27;re right.&quot; Advised that taking a deep breath after the cyanide pellets were dropped would make her death easier, she replied, &quot;How the hell would you know?&quot;

Barbara Graham was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, San Rafael, California.

==In popular culture==
Actress Susan Hayward won the Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Graham in the 1958 film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;, a fictionalized version of events which suggests that Graham was innocent since it was based on letters Graham wrote to a journalist. The film is from Graham&#x27;s point of view and includes details differing from real life, in particular, the manner in which the police found and arrested Graham.

Reporter Gene Blake, who covered Graham&#x27;s murder trial for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Mirror&quot;, dismissed the movie as &quot;a dramatic and eloquent piece of propaganda for the abolition of the death penalty.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; reporter Bill Walker also exposed the inaccuracies of the film in his article in the April 1959 issue of &quot;Cavalier&quot;, &quot;Exposing Hollywood&#x27;s &#x27;I Want to Live&#x27; Hoax&quot;, and in a 1961 book titled &quot;The Case of Barbara Graham.&quot; However, while the movie may have been fictionalized, there is still some doubt about Graham&#x27;s guilt and the manner in which it was &#x27;proved&#x27;.

Marcia Clark, a former deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County and the lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, has authored &quot;Trial by Ambush&quot;, a true crime book exploring the Barbara Graham case, set for publication on December 1, 2024.

Graham was also portrayed by actress Lindsay Wagner in the 1983 TV movie &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;

The jazz/pop singer Nellie McKay had a touring production titled &quot;I Want To Live!&quot; that tells the story through standards, original tunes, and dramatic interludes.

<text>Upton Court Grammar School is a fully selective academy school in Lascelles Road, Slough, Berkshire.

The school has specialisms in languages and science. It is also a Leading Edge School, an ICT-Focus School, a Training School, an International School under the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and a participant in the Primary Language Initiative. From September 2004 it offered some International Baccalaureate courses alongside its conventional secondary and sixth form courses, but these are now discontinued.

==History==

=== Slough Secondary School (1912–36) ===
Slough Secondary School was the name of the first major selective secondary school in Slough (originally Buckinghamshire but now Berkshire). It was founded in 1912 just to the west of William Street, in the town centre. By 1936, the School had outgrown its premises and was split into Slough Grammar School for boys (1936–82) in Lascelles Road and Slough High School for girls (1936–82) in Twinches Lane, although the girls stayed on in the William Street buildings until 1939 when their new buildings were ready.

The original Slough Secondary School buildings in William Street were re-used during the Second World War and afterwards as temporary school accommodation. They were redeveloped in the 1960s as the tower blocks of Slough College, which became the Slough Campus of Thames Valley University. The area is being redeveloped again, under the Heart of Slough project.

=== Slough High School for Girls (1936–82) ===
Slough High School was a girls selective grammar school in Slough, Buckinghamshire, now Berkshire. It was formed in 1936 from the split of Slough Secondary School (1912–36) into Slough Grammar School for boys (1936–82) and Slough High School for girls.

For the first three years of its existence, it occupied the former Slough Secondary School buildings in William Street, but, in 1939, it moved to new buildings in Twinches Lane, Cippenham.

In 1982, when the Twinches Lane site was sold for redevelopment, Slough Grammar School and Slough High School merged to form Upton Grammar School (1982–93), based on the Lascelles Road site of Slough Grammar School.

In April 2014 a team of registered inspectors conducted a two-day full review of Upton Court Grammar School following the Ofsted framework for inspection of schools. The school was given an overall rating of &quot;Outstanding&quot;, although the Sixth Form was only rated &quot;Good&quot;, with serious concerns raised over the number of students unable to progress from AS level to A2 level studies due to poor grades.
Upton Court Grammar is known as a multicultural school that has achieved a remarkably happy coexistence of students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. The school is committed to its international school status, and to the understanding of other cultures as well as other languages. The 2008 OFSTED inspection report describes Slough Grammar as &quot;outstanding&quot; the 2011 OFSTED interim assessment confirms that the standards are unchanged, The IB courses offered put it into a different category for 6th form league tables. The IB results were strong in 2006 and this has had a slight knock on effect in reducing the overall grade spread at A level.

, the IB courses have been discontinued.

== Old Paludians ==

The term &quot;Paludian&quot; for former students of the school(s) is derived from the Latin word &quot;palus&quot; (genitive &quot;paludis&quot;), meaning a marsh or slough. The term was first coined by the Headmaster, W. Francis Smith, in 1915, when the Old Paludians Association was formed, and has been in continuous use ever since. &quot;Old Paludians&quot; is sometimes informally contracted to &quot;Old Pals&quot;.

In 1936, the Association split into the Boys (or Sports) section and the Girls section. By the 1950s, the Boys section reformed to become the Old Paludians Ltd. They moved to Taplow and nowadays play as Taplow United.

Meanwhile, the Girls section became the current Old Paludians Association and organises annual reunions for former students - both boys and girls.

<text>The 1963–64 [[Bundesliga]] season was the inaugural season for a single division highest tier of football in West Germany. It began on 24 August 1963 and ended on 9 May 1964. The first goal was scored by Friedhelm Konietzka for Borussia Dortmund in their game against Werder Bremen. The championship was won by 1. FC Köln. The first teams to be relegated were Preußen Münster and 1. FC Saarbrücken.

==Competition modus==
Every team played two games against each other team, one at home and one away. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw. If two or more teams were tied on points, places were determined by goal average. The team with the most points were crowned champions while the two teams with the fewest points were relegated to their respective Regionalliga divisions.

==Teams==

Sixteen teams were chosen from all Oberliga teams on both competitive and infrastructural aspects. The West and South divisions supplied five teams each, three clubs came from the North, while the Southwest provided two participants. The final member was chosen from the Oberliga Berlin.

The selection of teams for the inaugural Bundesliga season was controversial. Alemannia Aachen and Kickers Offenbach believed that they should have been chosen, due to their superior record over division rivals over the previous twelve seasons. They were not selected due to their relatively poorer performance in the seasons immediately preceding the start of the Bundesliga.

<doc id="698648" wikidata="Q1050425" url="?curid=698648" title="Polarization density">
<text>In classical electromagnetism, polarization density (or electric polarization, or simply polarization) is the vector field that expresses the volumetric density of permanent or induced electric dipole moments in a dielectric material. When a dielectric is placed in an external electric field, its molecules gain electric dipole moment and the dielectric is said to be polarized.

Electric polarization of a given dielectric material sample is defined as the quotient of electric dipole moment (a vector quantity, expressed as coulombs*meters (C*m) in SI units) to volume (meters cubed).
Polarization density is denoted mathematically by P; in SI units, it is expressed in coulombs per square meter (C/m2).

Polarization density also describes how a material responds to an applied electric field as well as the way the material changes the electric field, and can be used to calculate the forces that result from those interactions. It can be compared to magnetization, which is the measure of the corresponding response of a material to a magnetic field in magnetism.

Similar to ferromagnets, which have a non-zero permanent magnetization even if no external magnetic field is applied, ferroelectric materials have a non-zero polarization in the absence of external electric field.

==Definition==

An external electric field that is applied to a dielectric material, causes a displacement of bound charged elements.

A bound charge is a charge that is associated with an atom or molecule within a material. It is called &quot;bound&quot; because it is not free to move within the material like free charges. Positive charged elements are displaced in the direction of the field, and negative charged elements are displaced opposite to the direction of the field. The molecules may remain neutral in charge, yet an electric dipole moment forms.

For a certain volume element formula_1 in the material, which carries a dipole moment formula_2, we define the polarization density :
formula_3

In general, the dipole moment formula_2 changes from point to point within the dielectric. Hence, the polarization density of a dielectric inside an infinitesimal volume d&quot;V&quot; with an infinitesimal dipole moment is:
The net charge appearing as a result of polarization is called bound charge and denoted formula_5.

This definition of polarization density as a &quot;dipole moment per unit volume&quot; is widely adopted, though in some cases it can lead to ambiguities and paradoxes.

==Other expressions==

Let a volume be isolated inside the dielectric. Due to polarization the positive bound charge formula_6 will be displaced a distance formula_7 relative to the negative bound charge formula_8, giving rise to a dipole moment formula_9. Substitution of this expression in yields
formula_10

Since the charge formula_11 bounded in the volume is equal to formula_12 the equation for becomes:

where formula_13 is the density of the bound charge in the volume under consideration. It is clear from the definition above that the dipoles are overall neutral and thus formula_13 is balanced by an equal density of opposite charges within the volume. Charges that are not balanced are part of the free charge discussed below.

==Gauss&#x27;s law for the field of &quot;P&quot;==

For a given volume enclosed by a surface , the bound charge formula_5 inside it is equal to the flux of through taken with the negative sign, or

===Differential form===

By the divergence theorem, Gauss&#x27;s law for the field P can be stated in &quot;differential form&quot; as:
formula_16
where is the divergence of the field P through a given surface containing the bound charge density formula_17.

==Relationship between the fields of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;E&quot;==

===Homogeneous, isotropic dielectrics===

In a homogeneous, linear, non-dispersive and isotropic dielectric medium, the polarization is aligned with and proportional to the electric field E:
formula_18

where is the electric constant, and is the electric susceptibility of the medium. Note that in this case simplifies to a scalar, although more generally it is a tensor. This is a particular case due to the &quot;isotropy&quot; of the dielectric.

Taking into account this relation between P and E, equation () becomes:

The expression in the integral is Gauss&#x27;s law for the field which yields the total charge, both free formula_19 and bound formula_20, in the volume enclosed by . Therefore,

formula_21

which can be written in terms of free charge and bound charge densities (by considering the relationship between the charges, their volume charge densities and the given volume):
formula_22

Since within a homogeneous dielectric there can be no free charges formula_23, by the last equation it follows that there is no bulk bound charge in the material formula_24. And since free charges can get as close to the dielectric as to its topmost surface, it follows that polarization only gives rise to surface bound charge density (denoted formula_25 to avoid ambiguity with the volume bound charge density formula_17).

formula_25 may be related to by the following equation:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the normal vector to the surface pointing outwards. (see charge density for the rigorous proof)

===Anisotropic dielectrics===

The class of dielectrics where the polarization density and the electric field are not in the same direction are known as &quot;anisotropic&quot; materials.

In such materials, the -th component of the polarization is related to the -th component of the electric field according to:

formula_30

This relation shows, for example, that a material can polarize in the x direction by applying a field in the z direction, and so on. The case of an anisotropic dielectric medium is described by the field of crystal optics.

As in most electromagnetism, this relation deals with macroscopic averages of the fields and dipole density, so that one has a continuum approximation of the dielectric materials that neglects atomic-scale behaviors. The polarizability of individual particles in the medium can be related to the average susceptibility and polarization density by the Clausius–Mossotti relation.

In general, the susceptibility is a function of the frequency of the applied field. When the field is an arbitrary function of time , the polarization is a convolution of the Fourier transform of with the . This reflects the fact that the dipoles in the material cannot respond instantaneously to the applied field, and causality considerations lead to the Kramers–Kronig relations.

If the polarization P is not linearly proportional to the electric field , the medium is termed &quot;nonlinear&quot; and is described by the field of nonlinear optics. To a good approximation (for sufficiently weak fields, assuming no permanent dipole moments are present), P is usually given by a Taylor series in whose coefficients are the nonlinear susceptibilities:

formula_31

where formula_32 is the linear susceptibility, formula_33 is the second-order susceptibility (describing phenomena such as the Pockels effect, optical rectification and second-harmonic generation), and formula_34 is the third-order susceptibility (describing third-order effects such as the Kerr effect and electric field-induced optical rectification).

In ferroelectric materials, there is no one-to-one correspondence between P and E at all because of hysteresis.

==Polarization density in Maxwell&#x27;s equations==

The behavior of electric fields (, ), magnetic fields (, ), charge density () and current density () are described by Maxwell&#x27;s equations in matter.

===Relations between E, D and P===

In terms of volume charge densities, the free charge density formula_35 is given by

formula_36

where formula_37 is the total charge density. By considering the relationship of each of the terms of the above equation to the divergence of their corresponding fields (of the electric displacement field , and in that order), this can be written as:

formula_38

This is known as the constitutive equation for electric fields. Here is the electric permittivity of empty space. In this equation, P is the (negative of the) field induced in the material when the &quot;fixed&quot; charges, the dipoles, shift in response to the total underlying field E, whereas D is the field due to the remaining charges, known as &quot;free&quot; charges.

In general, varies as a function of depending on the medium, as described later in the article. In many problems, it is more convenient to work with and the free charges than with and the total charge.

Therefore, a polarized medium, by way of Green&#x27;s theorem can be split into four components.

* The bound volumetric charge density: formula_39
* The bound surface charge density: formula_40
* The free volumetric charge density: formula_41
* The free surface charge density: formula_42

===Time-varying polarization density===
When the polarization density changes with time, the time-dependent bound-charge density creates a &quot;polarization current density&quot; of

formula_43

so that the total current density that enters Maxwell&#x27;s equations is given by

formula_44

where Jf is the free-charge current density, and the second term is the magnetization current density (also called the &quot;bound current density&quot;), a contribution from atomic-scale magnetic dipoles (when they are present).

==Polarization ambiguity==
=== Crystalline materials ===
In a simple approach the polarization inside a solid is not, in general, uniquely defined. Because a bulk solid is periodic, one must choose a unit cell in which to compute the polarization (see figure). In other words, two people, Alice and Bob, looking at the same solid, may calculate different values of P, and neither of them will be wrong. For example, if Alice chooses a unit cell with positive ions at the top and Bob chooses the unit cell with negative ions at the top, their computed P vectors will have opposite directions. Alice and Bob will agree on the microscopic electric field E in the solid, but disagree on the value of the displacement field formula_45.

Even though the value of P is not uniquely defined in a bulk solid, &quot;variations&quot; in P &quot;are&quot; uniquely defined. If the crystal is gradually changed from one structure to another, there will be a current inside each unit cell, due to the motion of nuclei and electrons. This current results in a macroscopic transfer of charge from one side of the crystal to the other, and therefore it can be measured with an ammeter (like any other current) when wires are attached to the opposite sides of the crystal. The time-integral of the current is proportional to the change in P. The current can be calculated in computer simulations (such as density functional theory); the formula for the integrated current turns out to be a type of Berry&#x27;s phase.

The non-uniqueness of P is not problematic, because every measurable consequence of P is in fact a consequence of a continuous change in P. For example, when a material is put in an electric field E, which ramps up from zero to a finite value, the material&#x27;s electronic and ionic positions slightly shift. This changes P, and the result is electric susceptibility (and hence permittivity). As another example, when some crystals are heated, their electronic and ionic positions slightly shift, changing P. The result is pyroelectricity. In all cases, the properties of interest are associated with a &quot;change&quot; in P.

In what is now called the &quot;modern theory of polarization&quot;, the polarization is defined as a difference. Any structure which has inversion symmetry has zero polarization; there is an identical distribution of positive and negative charges about an inversion center. If the material deforms there can be a polarization due to the charge in the charge distribution.

=== Amorphous materials ===
Another problem in the definition of P is related to the arbitrary choice of the &quot;unit volume&quot;, or more precisely to the system&#x27;s &quot;scale&quot;. For example, at &quot;microscopic&quot; scale a plasma can be regarded as a gas of &quot;free&quot; charges, thus P should be zero. On the contrary, at a &quot;macroscopic&quot; scale the same plasma can be described as a continuous medium, exhibiting a permittivity formula_46 and thus a net polarization .

<text>&quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; (also known as &quot;Theme from M*A*S*H&quot; or &quot;Song from M*A*S*H&quot;) is a song written by Johnny Mandel (music) and Michael Altman (lyrics) for the 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. In addition to being performed by characters in the film, it plays during the title sequence as sung by The Ron Hicklin Singers. An instrumental version was used as the theme music for the TV series based on the film, playing over the opening and closing credits.

== Background ==
The song was written for Ken Prymus, the actor playing Private Seidman, to sing during the faux-suicide of Walter &quot;Painless Pole&quot; Waldowski (John Schuck) in the film&#x27;s &quot;Last Supper&quot; scene. Director Robert Altman had two stipulations about the song for composer Johnny Mandel: it had to be called &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; and it had to be the &quot;stupidest song ever written&quot;. Altman attempted to write the lyrics himself, but, upon finding it too difficult for his &quot;45-year-old brain&quot; to write something &quot;stupid&quot; enough, he gave the task to his 15-year-old-son Michael, who reportedly wrote the lyrics in five minutes.

Altman later decided that the song worked so well he would use it as the film&#x27;s main theme. This more choral version was sung by uncredited session singers John Bahler, Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin, and Ian Freebairn-Smith, and was released as a single attributed to &quot;The Mash&quot;. Altman said that, while he only made $70,000 for directing the movie, his son had earned more than $1 million for co-writing the song.

Several instrumental versions of the song were used as the theme for the TV series, but the lyrics were never used in the show. It became a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart in May 1980. The song was ranked No. 66 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs.

Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers released a cover version of &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; on September 7, 1992, as &quot;Theme from M.A.S.H. (Suicide Is Painless)&quot;. In the UK, it was a double A-side charity single to help The Spastics Society, with the Fatima Mansions&#x27; take on Bryan Adams&#x27; &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; as the other A-side. The 12-inch and CD versions of the UK single included &quot;Sleeping with the NME&quot; – an excerpt from a radio documentary recorded in the offices of the &quot;NME&quot; capturing staff&#x27;s reaction to photographs of guitarist Richey Edwards&#x27; infamous self-mutilation. The single peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart spending three weeks in the top 10.

<text>Périgord ( , ; ; or ) is a natural region and former province of France, which corresponds roughly to the current Dordogne department, now forming the northern part of the administrative region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It is divided into four areas called the Périgord Noir (Black), named so for the truffles that can be found there, the Périgord Blanc (White), for chalk cliffs and quarries, the Périgord Vert (Green), for forests and forestry and the Périgord Pourpre (Purple), for wine and viticulture. The geography and natural resources of Périgord make it a region rich in history and wildlife, and the newly created Parc Naturel Régional Périgord-Limousin aims to conserve it as such.

Périgord is noted for its cuisine, especially its duck and goose products, such as &quot;confit de canard&quot; and &quot;foie gras&quot;. It is known as a centre for truffles in France. Périgourdine wines include Bergerac (red and white) and Monbazillac.

==Geography==
Périgord surrounds and is named after the &quot;préfecture&quot; (capital) of the Dordogne, Périgueux, and also includes Bergerac in the south and Sarlat in the east.

==History==
There are Roman ruins in Périgueux which have been restored and the whole area is known as the &#x27;cradle of mankind&#x27; due to its wealth of prehistoric sites, of which the most famous prehistoric site is the painted cave of Lascaux, whose depictions of aurochs, horses, deer and other animals (but not of humans) date back some 17,000 years. The centre of prehistoric studies is the small town of les Eyzies, home to the newly rebuilt Museum of Pre-History, where 19th century archaeological investigations established the valley of the Vézère as an unusually rich array of pre-historic sites dating back some 40,000 years. One of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage locations, the valley contains 147 prehistoric sites dating from the Palaeolithic era and 25 decorated caves.

During the Roman conquest of Gaul, the area was organized as the territory of the Petrocorii () with its capital near modern Périgueux. This was known as Vesunna, apparently after a local Gaulish fertility goddess of the same name. Under the Roman Empire, it formed part of Gallia Aquitania and then, after the Diocletianic Reforms, Aquitania Secunda. The area was known in the early Middle Ages as the Petragoric lands () and then, after the 8th century, as the county of Périgord. The counts were vassals of the dukes of Aquitaine, making them part of the English Angevin Empire during the 13th century. The area was one of the main battlegrounds of the Hundred Years&#x27; War over the next two centuries. It passed into the hands of the dukes of Orleans in the 15th century, the d&#x27;Albrets in the 16th, and then finally crown land of the Kingdom of France upon the accession of Henri IV.

Owing to its contentious history, Périgord has numerous medieval castles and Renaissance chateaux, including Puymartin, Losse, Hautefort, and Beynac, Jumilhac-le-Grand, Fénelon, Biron, Bourdeilles, Castelnaud, Puyguilhem, and Rouffiac.

==In popular culture==
A visit to the province inspired the English novelist Julia Stuart to write her novel &quot;The Matchmaker of Périgord&quot;. Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Timeline&quot; is partially set in 1357 Périgord. Claude Chabrol filmed his classic thriller &quot;Le Boucher&quot; here in 1970, with references to Bergerac and the cinema at Sarlat. The Martin Walker crime novels featuring Bruno Courreges, chief of police, are set in the fictional town of St. Denis on the Vézère river. In Christian Vincent&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Haute Cuisine&quot; (French title: &quot;Les Saveurs du Palais&quot;), the protagonist Hortense Laborie is a chef from Périgord. The 2013 documentary film &quot;After Winter, Spring&quot; follows the lives of family farmers in Périgord, including their struggles in the face of real estate development, government agriculture policy, and large agribusiness.
In the eighth film in the MI7 Film Series, the main story is set in Perigord in a fictional version of the region where it becomes a country. It is run by the far right Nazi sympathiser Leon Napoli in the film.

<text>The 1964–65 Bundesliga was the second season of the Bundesliga, West Germany&#x27;s premier football league. It began on 22 August 1964 and ended on 15 May 1965. 1. FC Köln were the defending champions.

==Season overview==

The championship was won by Werder Bremen. Schalke 04 and Karlsruher SC were originally going to be demoted to the Regionalliga. However, the German FA became aware of irregularities regarding transfer fees, signing bonuses and player wages paid by Hertha BSC. A cash audit was ordered, and the evidence collected from there was enough to revoke Hertha&#x27;s license. In order to avoid any legal battles over Bundesliga membership, the FA decided to expand the league from sixteen to eighteen teams, meaning Schalke and Karlsruhe were spared relegation. Since Berlin should have a representative in the league as well, Tasmania Berlin were promoted besides the winners of the promotion play-off groups for the 1965–66 season.

The 1964–65 season saw the debut of Brazilian players in the Bundesliga. Zézé became the first Brazilian to play in the league when he fielded for 1. FC Köln against Hertha BSC on 22 August 1964 while Raoul Tagliari scored the first-ever Bundesliga goal by a Brazilian for Meidericher SV against 1. FC Nürnberg on 21 November 1964.

==Teams==
Preußen Münster and 1. FC Saarbrücken were relegated to the Regionalliga after finishing in the last two places. They were replaced by Hannover 96 and Borussia Neunkirchen, who won their respective promotion play-off groups.

<doc id="698656" wikidata="Q33725" url="?curid=698656" title="Karaim language">
<text>The Karaim language (Crimean dialect: , ; Trakai dialect: ), also known by its Hebrew name Lashon Kedar (, “language of the nomads&quot;), is a Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak group, with Hebrew influences, similarly to Yiddish or Judaeo-Spanish. It is presently spoken by only a few dozen Crimean Karaites () in Lithuania, Poland, Crimea, and Galicia in Ukraine. The three main dialects are those of Crimea, Trakai-Vilnius and Lutsk-Halych, all of which are critically endangered. The Lithuanian dialect of Karaim is spoken mainly in the town of Trakai by a small community living there since the 14th century.

There is a chance the language will survive in Trakai as a result of official support and because of its appeal to tourists coming to the Trakai Island Castle, where Crimean Karaites are presented as the castle&#x27;s ancient defenders.

==History==

===Karaims in Crimea and Lithuania===
The origin of the Karaims living in Crimea is subject to much dispute and inconsistency. Difficulty in reconstructing their history stems from the scarcity of documents pertaining to this population. Most of the known history is gathered from correspondence between the populations of Karaims and other populations in the 17th to 19th centuries. Furthermore, a large number of documents pertaining to the Crimean population of Karaims were burned during the 1736 Russian invasion of the Tatar Khanate&#x27;s capital, Bakhchisarai.

Some scholars say that Karaims in Crimea are descendants of Karaite merchants who migrated to Crimea from the Byzantine Empire. In one particular incidence, migration of Karaites from Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) to Crimea is documented following a fire in the Jewish quarter in 1203. After the Turco-Mongol invasions, settlement of merchants in Crimea may have been encouraged in the 13th and 14th centuries by the active trade routes from Crimea to China and Central Asia.

On the other hand, &quot;many scholars consider Karaims as descendants of Khazars and, later, Polovtsi tribes&quot; who converted to Karaite Judaism. Kevin Alan Brook considered the link to the Khazars as historically inaccurate and implausible while claiming Talmudic Jews (especially Ashkenaz) as the true preservers of the Khazar legacy.

The third hypothesis says that Karaims are the descendants of Israelite tribes from the time of the first exile by an Assyrian king (720s BCE). The Karaim scholar Abraham Firkovich collected the documents arguing in favor of this theory before the Russian Tsar. He was of the opinion that Israelites from Assyria had gone into the North Caucasus and from there, with the permission of the Assyrian king into the Crimean peninsula. He also claimed that he has found the tombstone of Yitzhak ha-Sangari and his wife who he claimed were Karaims. Whether Firkovich forged some of the tombstone inscriptions and manuscripts is controversial.

Regarding the origin of the Karaims in Lithuania also there is no complete consensus yet between the scholars. According to Lithuanian Karaim tradition they came from Crimea in 1392 when the Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania allied with Tokhtamysh against the White Horde Tatars and relocated 330 Karait families to Lithuania. Although linguistically sound, and in agreement with the tradition of the Lithuanian Tatars, claiming their origin from the collapsed Golden Horde, some modern historians doubt this assumption. Nevertheless, Karaims settled primarily in Vilnius and Trakai, maintaining their Tatar language; there was also further minor settlement in Biržai, Pasvalys, Naujamiestis and Upytė. Despite a history through the 16th and 17th centuries that included disease, famine, and pogroms, Lithuania was somewhat less affected by such turmoil than the surrounding areas. As a result, the Lithuanian Karaims had a relative sense of stability over those years, and maintained their isolation as a group, keeping their Turkic language rather than abandoning it for the local languages.
===Genetic affiliation of the Karaim language===
Karaim is a member of the &quot;Turkic language&quot; family, a group of languages of Eurasia spoken by historically nomadic peoples. Within the Turkic family, Karaim is identified as a member of the Kipchak languages, in turn a member of the Western branch of the Turkic language family. Within the Western branch, Karaim is a part of the Ponto-Caspian subfamily. This language subfamily also includes the Crimean Tatar of Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and Karachay-Balkar and Kumyk of Russia. The close relation of Karaim to Kypchak and Crimean Tatar makes sense in light of the beginnings of the Lithuanian Karaim people in Crimea.

One hypothesis is that Khazar nobility converted to Karaite Judaism in the late 8th or early 9th century and were followed by a portion of the general population. This may also have occurred later, under Mongol rule, during an influx of people from Byzantium.

As all Turkic languages, Karaim grammar is characterized by agglutination and vowel harmony. Genetic evidence for the inclusion of the Karaim language in the Turkic language family is undisputed, based on common vocabulary and grammar. Karaim has a historically subject–object–verb word order, extensive suffixing agglutination, the presence of vowel harmony, and a lack of gender or noun classes. Lithuanian Karaim has maintained most of these Turkic features despite its history of more than six hundred years in the environment of the Lithuanian, Russian, and Polish languages.

Most of the religious terminology in the Karaim language is Arabic in etymology, showing the origins of the culture in the Middle East. Arabic and Persian had the earliest influences on the lexicon of Karaim, while later on in its history, the Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish languages made significant contributions to the lexicon of Karaims living in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania.

==Language ecology==

===Distribution of Karaim speakers===
Today, there are Karaim speakers living in Crimea, Lithuania, Poland, Israel, and the United States. However, there only remain about 200 Karaims in Lithuania, only one quarter of whom are competent speakers of the Karaim language.

Karaim can be subdivided into three dialects. The now-extinct eastern dialect, known simply as Crimean Karaim, was spoken in Crimea until the early 1900s. The northwestern dialect, also called Trakai, is spoken in Lithuania, mainly in the towns of Trakai and Vilnius. The southwestern dialect, also known as the Lutsk or Halich dialect, spoken in Ukraine, was near-extinct with only six speakers in a single town as of 2001. Crimean Karaim is considered to make up the &quot;Eastern group,&quot; while the Trakai and Lutsk dialects comprise the &quot;Western group.&quot;

===Language contact===
 Throughout its long and complicated history, Karaim has experienced extensive language contact. A past rooted in Mesopotamia and persisting connections to the Arab world resulted in Arabic words which likely carried over via the migration of Karaites from Mesopotamia. The Karaim language was spoken in Crimea during the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so there is also a significant history of contact with Turkish, a distant relative in the Turkic language family. Finally, Karaim coexisted with Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian as a minority language in the other areas to which it dispersed where Karaims lived and had to speak the dominant majority languages.

Karaim speakers show a strong tendency towards code-copying. Code-copying differs from code-switching in that speakers don&#x27;t just switch from one language to another, but actually transfer lexical items and grammatical features from one language to another in processes that may be only for single instances, or that may have much more lasting effects on language typology. Extensive code-copying is indicative both of the ever-shrinking population of Karaim speakers (leading to an insufficient Karaim lexicon and a high frequency of borrowing from Russian, Polish, and Slavonic languages) and of the high level of language contact in the regions where Karaim is spoken.

===Multilingualism===
Due to the very small number of speakers of Karaim and the high level of multilingualism in Lithuania in general, there is also a high level of multilingualism among Karaim speakers. Karaim speakers also communicate with the dominant languages of their respective regions, including Lithuanian, Polish, and Russian. Some also have religious knowledge of Hebrew. Multilingualism is a necessity for Karaim speakers, because without other languages the majority would not even be able to communicate with members of their own family.

===Language health===
Most dialects of Karaim are now extinct. Maintenance of the Karaim language in Lithuania is now endangered due to the dispersal of Karaim speakers under the Soviet regime in the aftermath of World War II and the very small number and old age of fluent speakers remaining. Children and grandchildren of Karaim speakers speak Lithuanian, Polish, or Russian, and only the oldest generation still speaks Karaim.

==Phonology==

===Consonant inventory===
===Vowel inventory===
===Phonotactics===
While most languages of the Turkic family exhibit palatal vowel harmony, Trakai Karaim shows harmony in palatalization of consonants. Thus, in any given word, only palatalized or only non-palatalized consonants can be found. Palatalized consonants occur in the presence of front vowels, and non-palatalized consonants occur in the presence of back vowels. Similarly to most Turkic languages, virtually all of the consonants in Karaim exist in both a palatalized and a non-palatalized form, which may be further evidence of their genetic relationship. However, care must be taken in assuming as much, because Karaim has been in contact with the Lipka Tatar language in Lithuania for hundreds of years.

Karaim also exhibits vowel harmony, whereby suffix vowels harmonize for front or back quality with the vowels in the stem of a word.

==Morphology==
Karaim morphology is suffixing and highly agglutinating. The Karaim language lacks prefixes but uses postpositions. Nouns are inflected for seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, locative, and instrumental, which is rare in other Turkic languages). A notable feature of verb conjugation in Karaim is the possibility of abbreviated forms.

==Syntax==
Historically, Karaim had a typically Turkic SOV word order. However, it appears to have acquired somewhat free word order due to extensive language contact situations, and currently has a preference for SVO constructions. Due to the agglutinative nature of Karaim morphology, pronominal subjects are frequently dropped as the same information is already represented in the inflection of the main verb. Karaim is head-final and uses postpositions.

Karaim syntax exhibits multiple instances of code-copying, whereby Karaim merges with syntactic properties of other languages in its area due to strong language contact situations. The impact of such language contact is also evident in the Karaim lexicon, which has extensive borrowing. In more modern times, the significant borrowing is also representative of insufficiencies in the lexicon.

==Writing system==

The traditional script of the Karaites in the Hebrew alphabet was used until the 20th century. In many Karaite families, they still have Hebrew letter handwritten collection of texts of diverse content, referred to as &quot;miedžuma&quot;. The Karaim language has also been protected through translated religious works, such as bibles. Throughout the 20th century, the Karaite communities also used various modifications of Latin (Yañalif, Lithuanian and Polish alphabets) and Cyrillic alphabets.

=== Modern alphabet ===
In Lithuania and Poland, a modified Latin alphabet is used to write in Karaim, while in Crimea and Ukraine, it was written using Cyrillic script. From the 17th century up until the 19th century, Hebrew letters were used.

* Letters Е, Ю and Я used only after &quot;Л&quot; as an indicator of softness
* Letters Ж and Ц used only in Russian borrowings

== Dialectology ==
Pritsak 1959 treats the Turkic varieties of the Karaim community as a dialect of the Karaim language and distinguishes between the northwestern variety (Lithuanian or Trakai Karaim), the southwestern variety (Halich Karaim) and the eastern variety (Crimean Karaim). These communities share a common religious, historical and cultural tradition, and these breeds are linguistically related. Even so, the differences between the varieties spoken in the Halich and Lithuanian communities are so great that the users of both varieties prefer Russian or Polish when communicating with each other. The present differences are partly due to their development from different Kipchak breeds and partly due to the different linguistic environments that influenced their later development.

<doc id="698657" wikidata="Q1949910" url="?curid=698657" title="Motorpsycho (band)">
<text>Motorpsycho is a Norwegian rock band from Trondheim. Their music can generally be defined as progressive or psychedelic rock, but they also mix in elements from alternative, jazz, post-rock, pop, country and many other musical styles. The stable members of the band are Bent Sæther (born 18 February 1969, bass/vocals) and Hans Magnus &quot;Snah&quot; Ryan (born 31 December 1969, guitar/vocals). From 1992 to March 2005, Håkon Gebhardt (born 21 June 1969) was the band&#x27;s drummer. From December 2007 to May 2016 Kenneth Kapstad was the drummer of the band, being replaced by Tomas Järmyr, who joined in early 2017. Järmyr left the band in January 2023.

== Biography ==
Formed in the late 1980s as an alternative metal band (they picked their name after seeing the Russ Meyer film of the same name as part of a Russ Meyer triple bill – there was already a band named after &quot;Mudhoney&quot; and a band named after &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; – the other two films on the bill), Motorpsycho soon developed a unique blend of grunge, heavy metal and indie rock, as well as incorporating the sonic noise experiments of associated member Deathprod. The hugely ambitious, progressive double album &quot;Demon Box&quot; (1993) followed a series of low-profile EPs and albums, earning the band a nomination for a Norwegian Grammy, and secured a loyal following in Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as in Scandinavia.

The 1990s was an extremely productive era for the band. They released new material almost every year and enjoyed critical acclaim for each album—though not the massive sales the music press kept predicting.

With the 2000 album &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot;, Motorpsycho suddenly took huge steps away from their noisy hard rock roots, opting instead for a smoother, jazz-tinged approach to the songwriting and recording process. They kept this technique for the subsequent releases, &quot;Phanerothyme&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Love Cult&quot;.

Drummer Hakon Gebhardt left the band in 2003. The double album &quot;Black Hole/Blank Canvas&quot; was released 17/20 March 2006 in Europe, with Bent Saether playing drums. The album received great reviews.

On 28 March 2008 Motorpsycho released an album entitled &quot;Little Lucid Moments&quot;, with new drummer Kenneth Kapstad, and on 16 March 2008 a DVD containing music videos, live footage and documentaries entitled &quot;Haircuts&quot;.

To celebrate their 20th anniversary, the band released a vinyl-only album, &quot;Child of the Future&quot;, recorded by Steve Albini at the beginning of August 2009.

In January 2010 Motorpsycho released the album &quot;Heavy Metal Fruit&quot;, their first album featuring an external producer, Kåre Vestrheim, and also their third album in under two years.

In October 2011 the Dutch venue Effenaar released a limited edition live album exclusively on vinyl entitled &quot;Strings Of Stroop – Motorpsycho Live At Effenaar&quot;. The album features four Motorpsycho tracks recorded during various Motorpsycho shows at Effenaar between 1999 and 2010. Only 500 copies were pressed and sold at the band&#x27;s 14th show in the venue.

On 10 February 2012 Motorpsycho released the double CD/LP effort &quot;The Death Defying Unicorn&quot; in collaboration with keyboardist Ståle Storløkken from the free improv group Supersilent. The album is a reworking of an instrumental suite commissioned by and performed at Moldejazz 2010. During 2011, Sæther produced lyrics for a sweeping narrative, thus making the album version a concept album. As in its initial performance, the band and Storløkken are augmented by contributions from Trondheimssolistene, Trondheim Jazz Orchestra and violinist Ola Kvernberg. The core quartet performed the album in its entirety on every date during a March/April 2012 tour of Europe.

After the release and tour accompanying the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, the band felt the need to return to more traditional, guitar-based grounds and with Reine Fiske as second guitarist, recorded two albums, &quot;Still Life With Eggplant&quot; (released in spring 2013) and &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; (released in March 2014). To coincide with the release of &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, Motorpsycho launched their first-ever official website, www.motorpsycho.no.

After years of institutionalising the band in Norway, Motorpsycho were inducted at Rockheim, Norway&#x27;s rock music hall of fame, in a TV broadcast ceremony.

In 2016 the band released the studio album &quot;Here Be Monsters&quot;, which evolved from a piece of music they wrote for the Oslo Teknisk Museums birthday. The band played that special songs in the museum, with the help of Ståle Storløkken, and then decided to work on it in the studio.

In May 2016, after completing the European Here Be Monsters Tour, Kenneth Kapstad left Motorpsycho. Core members Sæther and Ryan spent the remainder of the year writing, rehearsing and performing a live score to the Carl Frode Tiller-written play &quot;Begynnnelser&quot; (eng. &quot;Beginnings&quot;) in a 38-date autumn run at Trøndelag Teater.

In a January 2, 2017, news update on their official home page, the band announced Swedish drummer Tomas Järmyr to be the third permanent member of Motorpsycho. Together, they have recorded &quot;The Tower&quot; in Los Angeles and Joshua Tree (at the famous recording studio, Rancho de la Luna), which was released on September 8 the same year.

On January 8, 2023, Järmyr left the band.

In 2024 Motorpsycho contributed their version of the song &quot;Up to Me&quot; from the 1971 album &quot;Aqualung&quot; by Jethro Tull to the album &quot;Aqualung (Redux)&quot; released through Magnetic Eye Records on 6 December 2024. The song has been referred to as &quot;the album&#x27;s strangest song, a mixture of psychedelic blues&quot; and &quot;medieval-sounding acoustic verses highlighted by flute and percussion.&quot; They wanted to make a modern version of the song and not sound &quot;too close to the original.&quot; The result was a heavier version that &quot;retained the characteristic flute interludes&quot; with a &quot;rumbling bassline that rattles along on its own momentum.&quot;

<doc id="698661" wikidata="Q1633777" url="?curid=698661" title="Huddersfield Narrow Canal">
<text>The Huddersfield Narrow Canal is an inland waterway in northern England. It runs just under from Lock 1E at the rear of the University of Huddersfield campus, near Aspley Basin in Huddersfield, to the junction with the Ashton Canal at Whitelands Basin in Ashton-under-Lyne. It crosses the Pennines by means of 74 locks and the Standedge Tunnel.

==Building the canal==

===Planning===
The canal was first proposed in 1793 at a meeting in the George Hotel, Huddersfield. Its engineer was Benjamin Outram on the recommendation of William Jessop. His plan was to start from the Huddersfield Broad Canal and follow the River Colne with a climb of to its summit where it would pass through a tunnel at Standedge before descending through Saddleworth and the Tame valley to the Ashton Canal near Ashton-under-Lyne. There were many woollen, worsted and cotton mills along its route which promised ample trade. However, there was the possible problem of the loss of their water supplies and so Outram proposed to build a number of reservoirs.

===Construction===

The canal was authorised by the (34 Geo. 3. c. 53). Construction began that same year with the marking out of the route. The practice was to set up a line of pegs or stakes about apart so that their tops would indicate the intended water level. It would then be possible to construct the appropriate embankments and cuttings.

As engineer, Outram provided an oversight of the work but he was also occupied by other projects. Day-to-day management was carried out by contractors employed and organised by the canal company committee. Progress was slow and erratic. It was also unfortunate that Outram was seriously ill for long periods between 1795 and 1797. The company was also short of money, partly because the costs had been seriously underestimated but also because shareholders were not honouring their pledges.

In 1799, severe floods damaged earthworks along the canal and various reservoirs. In particular, overflow of the Tunnelend Reservoir devastated the village of Marsden. Two aqueducts were also destroyed, diverting the company&#x27;s already-stretched funds. The Stakes Aqueduct was already in use and had to be replaced immediately. Outram had built it of stone and, due to its low height, it had needed to be constructed in four short spans. The narrow openings had impeded the unprecedented overflow and Outram replaced it with a single span cast iron structure, similar to the Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal.
Outram set out to overcome the problems with the Holmes Aqueduct by making the walls thicker where they joined the baseplates which were also thicker. However a major stress was the compressive force along the top of the wall plates where they bow outwards or inwards. In 1875 cross bracings were added to reinforce it. The Stakes Aqueduct is the oldest surviving aqueduct of its type that is still in use for its original purpose.
===The Standedge Tunnel===
Although the canal uses 74 locks to climb and descend the Pennines, there would have had to be many more without the digging of a very long tunnel through the Tame/Colne watershed (the River Colne flowing down to Huddersfield and the River Calder, and the Tame flowing down to Stockport and the River Mersey). The canal tunnel is long, making it the longest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. It is largely brick lined but in some places the tunnel has been left with a natural rock surface.
===The &quot;Black Flood&quot;===
In 1810, the Diggle Moss Reservoir gave way and Marsden was again flooded along with much of the Colne Valley. Houses and factories were wrecked and five people lost their lives. The force of the water was such that a fifteen-ton rock was carried down the valley.

===Completion===
Despite multiple problems, the building of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced greatly. Thomas Telford&#x27;s report during the construction of the Standedge Tunnel covered every expenditure to the last bucket; it was followed to the letter and the canal finally opened in 1811.

==Operation==

The canal operated for approximately 140 years. Although it was moderately successful for a while, its width (limited to boats less than wide), the large number of locks and the long Standedge Tunnel made it much less profitable than its main rival the Rochdale Canal which had a similar number of locks but was twice as wide with no long tunnel.

Standedge Tunnel proved to be a bottleneck having been constructed without a towpath. Narrowboats had to be &#x27;legged&#x27; through, eventually by professionally employed leggers. A company employee would chain the tunnel entrance behind a convoy of boats and walk over Boat Lane, accompanied by boat boys and girls leading the boat horses, to unchain the opposite end of the tunnel before the boat convoy arrived. This journey was made at least twice per day for over twenty years.

The construction of a double railway tunnel parallel to Standedge canal tunnel adversely affected canal revenues and the canal was mostly abandoned in 1944 (a short stretch in Huddersfield survived until closure in 1963).

==Restoration==
After 27 years of campaigning and restoration by the Huddersfield Canal Society, the canal was fully re-opened to navigation in 2001 when it again became one of three Pennine crossings, the others being the Rochdale and the Leeds and Liverpool (both broad canals). The canal is now entirely used by leisure boaters.

During the period of time when the canal was closed, several lengths were culverted and infilled and in some cases built over. Over the course of the restoration project, the vast majority of the obliterated line became available to be opened out again and the canal remains on a substantially identical alignment with some minor alterations.

===Huddersfield===
The Huddersfield Narrow Canal connects with the Huddersfield Broad Canal at the eastern end of Lock 1E. Lock 1E is to the west of the A629 Wakefield Road and the canal had been filled in beneath the road. A new bridge was built in 1985 but the width was only sufficient for narrowboats and so the section of broad canal from the bridge to Lock 1E is not accessible to vessels wider than . The bridge thus forms the effective, but unofficial, boundary between the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Huddersfield Broad Canal.

Due to a legal quirk, the stretch of the canal from Lock 1E to Queen Street South Bridge was not included in the original abandonment of the canal. Whilst locks on the remainder of the canal were capped, cascaded or demolished, locks 1E and 2E remained gated but eventually fell into dereliction. The old gates were only removed when canal restoration work started.

Two factories, Bates and Sellers Engineering, had been built immediately upstream of locks 2E and 3E respectively on the line of the canal and blocking it. In each case, the solution was the same: the lock was relocated upstream of the factory and a tunnel constructed below the factory. This avoided disruption to the firms using the sites. The remodelling of the canal can be clearly seen between the former site of Lock 2E and Queen Street South Bridge where a framework of girders sits above the channel to ensure that the deep piling remains secure.

Eleven years later, Sellers Engineering relocated to a new site. This enabled Lock 3E to be relocated again, this time to a site near the original Lock 3E. The stretch of canal previously in a tunnel under the factory was brought back to the surface and become a feature of the Huddersfield Waterfront development.


===Slaithwaite===
The section of canal through Slaithwaite town centre, between locks 21E and 23E, had been culverted and a car park covered part of the route.

Restoration caused some local controversy as it involved the felling of a row of mature cherry trees which had been planted along the infilled line although the local authority claimed that the trees were in poor condition and were unlikely to last for many more years in any case.

Lock 21E was relocated a short distance upstream, to the other side of Platt Lane, in order to ensure that the Platt Lane crossing could be achieved by a conventional bridge instead of the swing bridge that had existed prior to closure.

The stretch from 22E to 23E threads its way through an extremely tight space. Britannia Road Bridge was formerly hump backed but changes in traffic levels since closure rendered such a bridge impractical and instead the pound from 22E to 23E was lowered by .

===Hartshead Power Station===
On the western side of the Pennines, the canal runs through the legs of an electricity pylon at Heyrod, near Stalybridge.

The pylon had been erected during the period when the canal was closed and the only viable route for restoration was through the legs.

No other such cases are known on navigable waterways worldwide although other pylons have been constructed across former waterways that have been filled in with rubble and soil such as the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Wey and Arun Canal at Rowner Lock.
==The canal today==
The canal is part of the South Pennine Ring crossing the Pennines twice – the other crossing is the Rochdale Canal. The canals are linked at the western (Lancashire) end by the Ashton Canal and at the eastern (Yorkshire) end by the Huddersfield Broad Canal and a length of the Calder and Hebble Navigation. 

This takes in Huddersfield, Golcar, Slaithwaite, Marsden, Saddleworth, Diggle, Uppermill, Greenfield, Mossley, Stalybridge, Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester at its central Cheshire Ring (New Islington) and Etihad stadium (Bradford/Eastlands) districts, Failsworth, Rochdale, Littleborough, Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge, Elland and Brighouse.

The &quot;Lock Gates Sundial&quot; is a large piece of public art alongside the canal in Armentieres Square in Stalybridge. It commemorates the reopening of the canal and was installed in 2008. The north facing balance beam forms the gnomon of the sundial, and heel stones mark the time.

The Huddersfield Canal was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1988. It was cited as being a good example of a flowing eutrophic water system with several nationally rare plants, fourteen species of mollusc and the fresh-water sponge Spongilla lacustris. In 2010, the site and its features were assessed as being in unfavourable condition,
with sediment management and agricultural source of pollution identified as high risk pressures on the site.

<text>Bob Hund (Swedish for &quot;Bob Dog&quot;) is an indie rock band from Sweden. Their music has been described as &quot;what you might expect if you managed to merge Pere Ubu and Pixies with a touch of Kraftwerk&quot;.
bob hund have performed mostly in Scandinavia as well as in Poland and England. Some of their performances include Roskilde, Hultsfred, Ruisrock and Quart music festivals.

== History ==

bob hund was formed in 1991 by Jonas Jonasson (keyboards) and Thomas Öberg (vocals) after meeting in high school. After six formative months the band&#x27;s line-up was finished, with Conny Nimmersjö and Johnny Essing on guitar, Mats Hellqvist on bass and Mats Andersson on drums. Legend has it that Essing joined rehearsals to pay off a 100 SEK debt to Hellqvist, and just kept coming back. 

The band once stated in an interview that the name &quot;bob hund&quot; originates from a cartoon dog named Bob Dog in Get a Job, that they once saw while watching television. The dog in question led a very unlucky life. 

The band was signed to Silence Records in 1993, and that same year released their debut EP, &quot;bob hund&quot;. The following year they released their first album, also called &quot;bob hund&quot;, and won Rock Band of the Year at the Swedish Grammy Awards, &quot;Grammisgalan&quot;. (They won another Grammis for Best Lyrics in 1996.)

In 1995, after extensive touring, the band went on hiatus as the members worked on new material, which would later make up the foundations for &quot;Omslag: Martin Kann&quot; (1996) - named after a friend of the band, who&#x27;ve done most of the band&#x27;s graphics work over the years. The album broke the top 10, but singles &quot;I stället för musik, förvirring&quot; (&quot;Instead of music, confusion&quot;) and &quot;Düsseldorf&quot; would both fail to break the singles top 10 - peaking at 13 and 28 respectively.

Though exclusively singing in Swedish, they started to gain attention outside of Sweden and Scandinavia. The band claimed in a press release that Graham Coxon - who has voiced his admiration of the band in interviews - asked to play with them, but that the band declined the offer.

bob hund once again toured extensively, and was awarded Live Band of the Year by Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet. In December 1998 &quot;Jag rear ut min själ! Allt skall bort!!!&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Selling Off My Soul! Everything Must Go!!!&quot;) was released followed by the live album &quot;bob hund sover aldrig&quot; (&quot;bob hund Never Sleeps&quot;).

At the start of the new millennium, equipment worth 115,000 SEK was stolen from their van. During this time, the band members had slowed down the activity of bob hund to concentrate on side projects - among others Bergman Rock, a rock band consisting of all bob hund members, but where Öberg sang in English rather than Swedish. New bob hund material would not surface until single &quot;Ska du hänga med? Nä!!&quot; (&quot;Are you tagging along? Nah!!&quot;) and album &quot;Stenåldern kan börja&quot; (&quot;Let the Stone Age Begin&quot;) was released in early 2001. The album would be the band&#x27;s first, and as of August 2010 only, to chart at number one.

2002 saw the release of &quot;Ingenting&quot; (&quot;Nothing&quot;), a compilation album containing old demos from 1992–1993, a limited vinyl pressing of 1000 copies only, single &quot;Den lilla planeten&quot; (&quot;The Small Planet&quot;). The two CD &quot;10 år tillbaka och 100 år framåt&quot; (&quot;10 Years Back and 100 Years Forward&quot;) was also released this year. The first disc being a singles compilation, and the second disc contained a live performance recorded in London 2001. During the performance Öberg can be heard explaining, in English, that he&#x27;ll only speak Swedish to the crowd so they&#x27;ll know they&#x27;ve paid for the real deal.

After the release of &quot;Det där nya som skulle vara så bra&quot; (&quot;That New Thing That Was Supposed To Be So Good&quot;) the band went on an extended hiatus to concentrate on Bergman Rock and the dance side project Sci-Fi SKANE. The band started touring as bob hund again in late 2006, but would not release any new material until 2008s single &quot;Tinnitus i hjärtat&quot; (&quot;Tinnitus of the Heart&quot;) and album &quot;Folkmusik för folk som inte kan bete sig som folk&quot; (&quot;Folk music for folk who can&#x27;t behave like folk&quot;).

On 16 June 2009 Christian Gabel officially joined as the seventh member of the band, filling in on drums.
In the following year the new lineup released the four-track EP &quot;Stumfilm&quot; (&quot;Silent Movie&quot;).

On 16 March 2011 the group released the album &quot;Det överexponerade gömstället&quot; (&quot;The Overexposed Hideout&quot;). As a form of commemoration of their 20th anniversary, a second album was released the 15th of February 2012, called &quot;Låter som miljarder&quot; (&quot;Sounds Like Billions&quot;).

On 6 July 2013 the band organized a festival in Folkets Hamn, Helsingborg. At this festival the group would auction off their old instruments and other objects that were left in their old rehearsal studio. The group themselves did not play at this festival, and were instead DJ:ing.

On 12 September 2014 the band premiered a new soundtrack for the silent film Man With a Movie Camera at Cinemateket in Stockholm, with subsequent performances in Helsinki, Luleå, Gothenburg and Malmö.

On 16 September 2016 they released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Dödliga Klassiker&quot; (&quot;Mortal Classics&quot;).

<text>Mercury4 were an Australian boy band vocal quartet formed in 2002 with Rien Low, Brad Johnston, Javier Perez and Cole Rintoul. In early 2004 Perez was replaced by Kevin Layton. They issued a self-titled studio album, &quot;Mercury4&quot; (May 2004) which reached the ARIA Albums Chart top 40. Their highest-charting single, &quot;Get Me Some&quot; (June 2003) had peaked at No. 5 on the related ARIA Singles Chart. It was followed by &quot;5 Years from Now&quot; (January 2004), which reached the top 20 and their cover version of Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (May 2004) peaked in the top 30. However, the group disbanded by late 2004.

== History ==

Mercury4 started in 2000 with Rien Low and Brad Johnston meeting and deciding to work together. Cole Rintoul joined in 2001 with Javier Perez joining in 2002. The band signed with BMG in late 2002 after a showcase gig at the Mercury Lounge, hence the name Mercury4.

BMG recruited hit production team the Matrix who had produced hits for Avril Lavigne and Hilary Duff to write and produce their first single &quot;Get Me Some&quot;. Released in June 2003 in Australia, it arrived at No. 5 on the ARIA Charts the following month.

Their second single, &quot;5 Years from Now&quot;, was released in January 2004 and reached No. 16 on the Australian charts in February 2004. The band&#x27;s third single &quot;Every Little Step&quot; (May 2004) was a cover of Bobby Brown&#x27;s 1989 single, and was produced by Cutfather &amp; Joe who wrote and produced the Jamelia hit &quot;Superstar&quot;. It reached No. 27.

In early 2004 Javier Perez left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Kevin Layton. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut &quot;Mercury4&quot; was released on 31 May 2004, and included a cover of Air Supply&#x27;s hit &quot;All Out of Love&quot; featuring vocals by Russell Hitchcock and Graham Russell from the original band. However, the album only charted for one week in Australia and the band were dropped from their label after BMG merged with Sony. The group disbanded by late 2004.

Member Kevin Layton auditioned for the 2009 series of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; but missed out on the Top 24. Rien Low auditioned for the 2011 series of &quot;The X Factor (Australia)&quot; but missed out on a spot in &quot;Natalie Bassingthwaighte&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;Over 25&#x27;s&#x27; category, making the Top 12 but not the Top 6. He also auditioned for &quot;Season 2&quot; of &quot;The Voice (Australia)&quot; but was unsuccessful.

==Members==

*Brad Johnston (born 30 November 1981) – lead vocals

<text>The HIPAS (HIgh Power Auroral Stimulation) Observatory was a research facility, built to study the ionosphere and its influence on radio communications. It was located 25 miles east of Fairbanks, Alaska in the Fairbanks North Star Borough area.

It was operated by the UCLA plasma physics laboratory from 1986 through 2007. A unique capability at that time, it could radiate 70 MW ERP at either 2.85 MHz or 4.53 MHz. These frequencies are close to a multiple of 2 and 3 of the electron gyro-frequency at ionospheric altitudes. Sending a pulse of HF-radio waves upward could accelerate the electrons in the ionosphere. Somewhat like waves on the ocean, the character of the ionosphere could be inferred from the backscatter signal. Other experiments attempted to combine RF and visible excitation where the latter probed metal ions such as sodium.

The HIPAS facility also used a LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) instrument. Other projects included:
* A plasma torch, used for experiments in hazardous waste disposal
* A 2.8-meter liquid-mirror telescope, which uses a spinning bowl of mercury to form the mirror, used for laser experiments.
* An array of antennae, which are used for exciting the ionosphere.

The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is a similar facility funded jointly by the US Air Force and US Navy.

The HIPAS facility was shut down and much of the equipment sold as surplus in the Spring of 2010.

<text>The Pčinja District (, ) is one of the nine administrative districts of Southern and Eastern Serbia. It covers the southern part of Serbia, bordering 
Kosovo, along with Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Its administrative center is the city of Vranje.

As of the 2022 census, the district has a population of 193,802 inhabitants.

The Vranjska Banja spa plays a part in this region with its multi-medicinal thermal mineral waters.

==Municipalities==
The district encompasses the municipalities of:
* Vladičin Han
* Surdulica
* Bosilegrad
* Trgovište
* Vranje
* Vranjska Banja
* Bujanovac
* Preševo
==Culture and history==
The ancient Paeonian tribe of the Agrianians ruled the region in antiquity.

Cultural and historical monuments date back from over five centuries ago. The earliest military fortification, Marko&#x27;s Fortress, was established in the 13th century. Also famous are the ancient Turkish public baths from the 16th century and the Pasha&#x27;s House from 1765, in which a grammar school was opened in 1882.

In 2001, uprisings by Albanians occurred in the Albanian-majority municipalities of Preševo and Bujanovac. In addition, reports emerged in 2006 that the municipality of Trgovište had threatened to secede itself to North Macedonia, which was noteworthy, since it had (and still has) a majority Serb population. Representatives cited economic hardship and a declining population as grievances against Serbia’s government.

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, the district has a population of 193,802 inhabitants.

===Ethnic composition===
=== Religion ===
Based on the census results from 2022, the Pčinja District has a Christian Orthodox majority (60.4%) and a substantial Muslim minority (31%).

<text>Mercury4 is the debut, and only, album by boy band, Mercury4, which was released on 31 May 2004 and peaked at No. 32 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

==Making of the album and chart success==

BMG recruited hit production team the Matrix who had produced hits for Avril Lavigne and Hilary Duff to write and produce Mercury4&#x27;s first single &quot;Get Me Some&quot;. Released in June 2003 in Australia, it rose to the top five of the ARIA Singles Chart in the following month.

Their second single &quot;5 Years From Now&quot; was released in January 2004 and reached the top 20 of the Australian charts in February 2004. The band&#x27;s third single &quot;Every Little Step&quot;, is a cover version of the Bobby Brown hit from his album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;.

<text>The Peć District (Serbian: Пећки округ or &quot;Pećki okrug&quot; , also called &quot;Dukagjin&quot; or &quot;Regjioni i Pejës&quot; in Albanian) was a district in Kosovo between 1990 and 1999. It was located in the western part of Kosovo. 90% of its population of 351,680 is Albanian, but there are other ethnic groups such as Serbs, Roma, and others.

Peja is first mentioned in 1302, as Archiepiscopal seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Patriarchal Monastery of Peć consists of a group of monasteries and has been the seat of the Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs for centuries. It is famous for its monastic complex in Peć, the official residence of the Patriarchs of the Serbian Orthodox Church. 

The frescoes from the church of St. Apostles, dating from the thirteenth century, rank among the most remarkable medieval Serbian paintings. Over the centuries, churches and other buildings of the Peć Patriarchy have been destroyed and reconstructed several times. Today&#x27;s appearance dates back to 1931-1932. The Visoki Dečani Monastery is one of the most grandiose monuments of the Serb medieval culture. It is the endowment of King Stefan Dečanski, built from 1327 to 1335.

<text>Luftvärnsrobotvagn 701 (abbreviated lvrbv 701) is a Swedish self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle armed with the locally produced short range RBS 70 surface-to-air missile system. The lvrbv 701 is not NBC-protected and has no night vision equipment. Except for the armament, lvrbv 701 is identical to the Pansarvärnsrobotbandvagn 551 ATGM carrier. Both vehicles were built from the chassis of obsolete Infanterikanonvagn 103 self-propelled guns (some Pansarvärnsrobotbandvagn 551s used the Infanterikanonvagn 102 chassis instead). Conversion to the lvrbv 701 was done during the 1980s and the vehicle was taken out of active service around the year 2000.

<doc id="698694" wikidata="Q270679" url="?curid=698694" title="Jennifer Hawkins">
<text>Jennifer Hawkins (born 22 December 1983) is an Australian TV host, model and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 2004. She had previously been crowned Miss Universe Australia 2004. She was the host of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, and was brand ambassador for Lovable Intimates, Mount Franklin Lightly Sparkling and Range Rover, and formerly the face of Australian department store Myer.

== Early life ==
Hawkins was born in Holmesville, New South Wales, to Gail and Robert. She attended West Wallsend High School in West Wallsend, New South Wales. She is one of four siblings. Hawkins was a cheerleader for the Newcastle Knights rugby league team, and the Hunter Pirates basketball team and also worked as a model. It was as a model that she was cast as Miss Australia for the Miss Universe competition.
Hawkins also worked as a choreographer for a dance team that toured Australia specialising in Hip Hop and Ballet.

== Career ==
=== Miss Universe ===

Before participating in Miss Universe 2004, Hawkins sought advice from the previous Miss Universe Australia, Ashlea Talbot, who represented Australia in the 2003 competition, and learned basic Spanish prior to travelling to Ecuador.

The Miss Universe pageant was held in Quito, Ecuador, on 1 June 2004. A week prior to the event, Hawkins was ranked sixth favourite to win the crown. During the final competition, she became the first Australian to make the semi-finals since Voni Delfos in 1993. She then proceeded to the top ten after competing in the evening gown competition, where she wore an unusual vintage copper gown that was designed by Bora and cost A$25,000. After the swimsuit competition, Hawkins advanced to the top five, and eventually won the Miss Universe title. The remaining top five were all delegates from the Americas and Caribbean, including Shandi Finnessey of the USA (1st runner-up), Alba Reyes of Puerto Rico (2nd runner-up), Yanina Gonzalez of Paraguay (3rd runner-up) and Danielle Jones of Trinidad and Tobago (4th runner-up). Hawkins was the second winner from Oceania since Lorraine Downes of New Zealand held the title in 1983, and the second Australian since Kerry Anne Wells who was crowned in Dorado, Puerto Rico in 1972 (Coincidentally both women were crowned in Spanish speaking countries).

Hawkins was crowned by outgoing titleholder Amelia Vega from the Dominican Republic, after being announced by host Billy Bush as the &quot;thunder from down under&quot;.

Hawkins received an elaborate Mikimoto pearl encrusted crown, worth $250,000, as well as an extensive prize package. Hawkins was the first blonde-haired woman to win the title since Angela Visser of the Netherlands in 1989.

As Miss Universe, Hawkins represented the Miss Universe Organization. Her &quot;sister&quot; 2004 titleholders were Shelley Hennig (Miss Teen USA, of Louisiana) and Shandi Finnessey (Miss USA, of Missouri). During her reign, Hawkins travelled to Korea, The Bahamas, Brazil, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Singapore, Indonesia, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, India, Ecuador, Mexico, Puerto Rico, had multiple trips to Thailand, the host of Miss Universe 2005, and her home country of Australia. In Brazil, after an official meeting with Vice-President José Alencar, he said she was &quot;the prettiest girl I have ever seen in my life&quot;. Also, she was the first Miss Universe ever to parade in a Samba School (as Eve) during Brazilian carnival, in February 2005.

As part of her year-long reign as Miss Universe, she lived in New York City in a riverside apartment provided by the Miss Universe Organization. At this time, Hawkins stated that her wish was to continue modelling and become a television presenter.

Shortly after being crowned Miss Universe in 2004, Hawkins created news during a fashion show at Westfield Miranda, an Australian shopping centre, when she tripped on the hem of her dress, which fell to the floor. Hawkins was left scantily clad in her red g-string in front of a surprised crowd. Hawkins later apologised, laughingly adding she &quot;wished she wore better underwear&quot;. The incident received the dubious distinction of being named &quot;The most embarrassing moment ever shown on Australian television&quot; by Australia&#x27;s Nine Network. The &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; was widely circulated through news outlets and according to Google, caused a sharp increase in internet searches for &quot;Jennifer Hawkins&quot;.

Hawkins served as a judge for the Miss Universe 2008 finals in Vietnam.

=== Television presenting ===
Hawkins signed a contract with the Seven Network at the 2004 Melbourne Cup Carnival. Her first appearances were as a guest presenter on the network&#x27;s travel show, &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;, where she took viewers on tours throughout the world. When she ended her reign as Miss Universe, she became a regular presenter on the show, which resulted in a 2006 Logie nomination for Most Popular New Female Talent. No new episodes of the programme have been produced since 2009.

Hawkins also served as the host and one of the judges for Australia&#x27;s &quot;Make Me a Supermodel&quot;, which debuted on the Seven Network in August 2008. The series aired for a single season.

Media outlets reported in October 2010 that Hawkins would depart Seven and move to the Nine Network after the expiration of her contract.

Hawkins became the host for the hit TV show &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, replacing Sarah Murdoch.

=== Other ===
Hawkins was one of the participants in the fourth season of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and was the fifth celebrity eliminated. On 15 February 2006, she was in a celebrity version of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; called &quot;Dancing with the Deal&quot; which featured celebrities from &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She won $2,000 after refusing every deal.

Hawkins is featured as the love interest of Australian artist, Guy Sebastian in the music video for the second single &quot;Elevator Love&quot; off his third album, &quot;Closer to the Sun&quot;.

<text>The Kosovska Mitrovica District was a district in Kosovo between 1990 and 1999. It was located in the northern part of Kosovo i Metohija. It had a population of 275,904. The seat of the district was in the city of Mitrovica. From the point of view of the Serbian government, the district de jure still exists, despite the fact that the Serbian government accepted civil UN administration over Kosovo.

==Municipalities==

It included the municipalities of:

*Zubin Potok
*Leposavić
*Zvečan
*Mitrovica
*Srbica
*Vučitrn

==Culture and history==

Mitrovica, being a medieval settlement, is rich in famous edifices and monuments: the Church of St. Dimitri originating from the fourteenth century, and the Church of St. Sava from the nineteenth century. In the vicinity of Mitrovica is the Devič Monastery, the first mention of which was found in 1578.

<text>The Public Transport Users Association (PTUA) is a community-based public transport lobby group in Victoria, Australia, based in Melbourne. It is run entirely by volunteers and has no full-time staff.

== History and aims ==
The organisation was founded in 1976 as the Train Travellers Association, and became prominent after the controversial Lonie Report recommended huge freeway expansion and closure of most public passenger transport in the city.

The Association advocates a greater role for public transport and less dependence on the private car. Key PTUA policies include: 
* A publicly accountable authority to provide co-ordinated planning and management of train, tram and bus services,
* The favouring of sustainable transport modes over cars, through appropriate urban planning decisions, and taxation and transport project resource allocations,
* Opposition to major road expansion such as the building of new freeways,
* More frequent public transport services, longer operating hours and better connections between modes,
* Expansion of the train, tram, and bus networks,
* More staffing at stations and on trains/trams,
* Fares that ensure public transport is competitive with car travel.

Of particular interest to the Association are potential extensions to Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan rail network, particularly lines to Doncaster, Rowville (via Monash University&#x27;s Clayton Campus) and Melbourne Airport, the revitalisation of the bus network, including more routes being upgraded to SmartBus status, and filling in so-called &quot;tram missing links&quot;, by the construction of mostly minor extensions to the tram network that will ensure that routes terminate at nearby railway stations, bus routes and activity centres.

== Achievements ==
The PTUA successfully campaigned for extended New Year&#x27;s Day public transport hours in 2004, and that has been continued by the state government in subsequent years. They also successfully lobbied for the extension of the 109 tram to Box Hill in Melbourne&#x27;s east. The association successfully pushed against the contentious idea to prohibit bikes on trains during rush hour in 2008, garnering substantial media attention. The Association maintains a high media profile, publishes a regular newsletter for members, operates an office in Melbourne, and has a branch in Geelong The Ballarat branch is dormant.

The current president is Tony Morton, who succeeded Daniel Bowen in October 2012.

<doc id="698711" wikidata="Q4371287" url="?curid=698711" title="Landau pole">
<text>In physics, the Landau pole (or the Moscow zero, or the Landau ghost) is the momentum (or energy) scale at which the coupling constant (interaction strength) of a quantum field theory becomes infinite. Such a possibility was pointed out by the physicist Lev Landau and his colleagues in 1954. The fact that couplings depend on the momentum (or length) scale is the central idea behind the renormalization group.

Landau poles appear in theories that are not asymptotically free, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED) or theory—a scalar field with a quartic interaction—such as may describe the Higgs boson. In these theories, the renormalized coupling constant grows with energy. A Landau pole appears when the coupling becomes infinite at a finite energy scale. In a theory purporting to be complete, this could be considered a mathematical inconsistency. A possible solution is that the renormalized charge could go to zero as the cut-off is removed, meaning that the charge is completely screened by quantum fluctuations (vacuum polarization). This is a case of quantum triviality, which means that quantum corrections completely suppress the interactions in the absence of a cut-off.

Since the Landau pole is normally identified through perturbative one-loop or two-loop calculations, it is possible that the pole is merely a sign that the perturbative approximation breaks down at strong coupling. Perturbation theory may also be invalid if non-adiabatic states exist. Lattice gauge theory provides a means to address questions in quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory, and thus has been used to attempt to resolve this question.

Numerical computations performed in this framework seem to confirm Landau&#x27;s conclusion that in QED the renormalized charge completely vanishes for an infinite cutoff.

== Brief history ==
According to Landau, Abrikosov, and Khalatnikov, the relation of the observable charge to the &quot;bare&quot; charge for renormalizable field theories when is given by

where is the mass of the particle and is the momentum cut-off. If and then and the theory looks trivial. In fact, inverting , so that (related to the length scale ) reveals an accurate value of ,
{1-\beta_2 g_\text{obs} \ln \Lambda/m}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

As grows, the bare charge increases, to finally diverge at the renormalization point
 \right].&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This singularity is the Landau pole with a &quot;negative residue&quot;, .

In fact, however, the growth of invalidates ,  in the region , since these were obtained for , so that the nonperturbative existence of the Landau pole becomes questionable.

The actual behavior of the charge as a function of the momentum scale is determined by the Gell-Mann–Low equation

which gives Eqs. ,  if it is integrated under conditions for and for , when only the term with is retained in the right hand side. The general behavior of depends on the appearance of the function .

According to the classification of Bogoliubov and Shirkov, there are three qualitatively different cases:

Landau and Pomeranchuk tried to justify the possibility (c) in the case of QED and theory. They have noted that the growth of in drives the observable charge to the constant limit, which does not depend on . The same behavior can be obtained from the functional integrals, omitting the quadratic terms in the action. If neglecting the quadratic terms is valid already for , it is all the more valid for of the order or greater than unity: it gives a reason to consider to be valid for arbitrary . Validity of these considerations at the quantitative level is excluded by the non-quadratic form of the -function.

Nevertheless, they can be correct qualitatively. Indeed, the result can be obtained from the functional integrals only for , while its validity for , based on , may be related to other reasons; for this result is probably violated but coincidence of two constant values in the order of magnitude can be expected from the matching condition. The Monte Carlo results seems to confirm the qualitative validity of the Landau–Pomeranchuk arguments, although a different interpretation is also possible.

The case (c) in the Bogoliubov and Shirkov classification corresponds to the quantum triviality in full theory (beyond its perturbation context), as can be seen by a reductio ad absurdum. Indeed, if , the theory is internally inconsistent. The only way to avoid it, is for , which is possible only for . It is a widespread belief that both QED and theory are trivial in the continuum limit.

== Phenomenological aspects ==
In a theory intended to represent a physical interaction where the coupling constant is known to be non-zero, Landau poles or triviality may be viewed as a &quot;sign of incompleteness in the theory&quot;. For example, QED is usually not believed to be a complete theory on its own, because it does not describe other fundamental interactions, and contains a Landau pole. Conventionally QED forms part of the more fundamental electroweak theory. The group of electroweak theory also has a Landau pole which is usually considered to be a signal of a need for an ultimate embedding into a Grand Unified Theory. The grand unified scale would provide a natural cutoff well below the Landau scale, preventing the pole from having observable physical consequences.

The problem of the Landau pole in QED is of purely academic interest, for the following reason. The role of in ,  is played by the fine structure constant and the Landau scale for QED is estimated as , which is far beyond any energy scale relevant to observable physics. For comparison, the maximum energies accessible at the Large Hadron Collider are of order , while the Planck scale, at which quantum gravity becomes important and the relevance of quantum field theory itself may be questioned, is . The energy of the observable universe is on the order of .

The Higgs boson in the Standard Model of particle physics is described by theory (see &quot;Quartic interaction&quot;). If the latter has a Landau pole, then this fact is used in setting a &quot;triviality bound&quot; on the Higgs mass. The bound depends on the scale at which new physics is assumed to enter and the maximum value of the quartic coupling permitted (its physical value is unknown). For large couplings, non-perturbative methods are required. This can even lead to a predictable Higgs mass in asymptotic safety scenarios. Lattice calculations have also been useful in this context.

== Connections with statistical physics ==
A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the
renormalization process leading to Landau poles comes from condensed matter physics. Leo P. Kadanoff&#x27;s paper in 1966 proposed the &quot;block-spin&quot; renormalization group. The &quot;blocking idea&quot; is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances. This approach was developed by Kenneth Wilson. He was awarded the Nobel prize for these decisive contributions in 1982.

Assume that we have a theory described by a certain function of the state variables and a set of coupling constants . This function can be a partition function, an action, or a Hamiltonian.
Consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables , the number of must be lower than the number of . Now let us try to rewrite &quot;only&quot; in terms of the . If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, , then the theory is said to be renormalizable. The most important information in the RG flow are its fixed points. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit quantum triviality, and possesses a Landau pole. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but it is not known whether these correspond to free field theories.

== Large order perturbative calculations ==
Solution of the Landau pole problem requires the calculation of the Gell-Mann–Low function at arbitrary and, in particular, its asymptotic behavior for . Diagrammatic calculations allow one to obtain only a few expansion coefficients , which do not allow one to investigate the function in the whole. Progress became possible after the development of the Lipatov method for calculating large orders of perturbation theory: One may now try to interpolate the known coefficients with their large order behavior, and to then sum the perturbation series.

The first attempts of reconstruction of the function by this method bear on the triviality of the theory. Application of more advanced summation methods yielded the exponent in the asymptotic behavior , a value close to unity. The hypothesis for the asymptotic behavior of was recently presented analytically for theory and QED. Together with positiveness of , obtained by summation of the series, it suggests case (b) of the above Bogoliubov and Shirkov classification, and hence the absence of the Landau pole in these theories, assuming perturbation theory is valid (but see above discussion in the introduction ).

<doc id="698714" wikidata="Q5196292" url="?curid=698714" title="Custard pie">
<text>A custard pie is any type of uncooked custard mixture placed in an uncooked or partially cooked crust and baked together. In North America, &quot;custard pie&quot; commonly refers to a plain mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla extract and sometimes nutmeg combined with a pie crust. It is distinctly different from a cream pie, which contains cooked custard poured into a cooled, precooked crust. In the United Kingdom, the comical or political act of pieing is conventionally done with a &quot;custard pie&quot;. Some common custard pies include pumpkin pie, lemon and buttermilk chess pie, coconut cream pie, and buko pie. True custard is defined as a liquid thickened with eggs. The often large number of whole eggs in custard pie make it very rich.

Cooks in Classical antiquity understood the binding properties of eggs.
During the Middle Ages, the first custard pies - in the modern sense of the term - began to appear. Initially, custards were used only as fillings for pies, pastries and tarts. Both Europe and Asia had recipes that contained custards.

The word &quot;custard&quot; derives from &quot;crustade&quot; (a pie with a crust),
or from &quot;&quot; (an edible container of savoury food). After the 16th century, custards began to be used in individual dishes rather than as a filling in crusts.

Today, custards are used as filling in pies and tarts, and as individual dishes. Ideally a custard pie should be light and delicate, but still have good body. Custards can be made in two ways: baked or stirred upon the stove, but most custard-pie recipes call for baking. The eggs in custard mixtures, when cooked, turn from liquid to solid. If cooked over excessive heat, the eggs will curdle, which is extremely undesirable. Curdling can be prevented by using lower temperatures and stirring. As such, making &quot;true&quot; custard pie is a very delicate process.

==History==
Savory pies with meat fillings were far more common than sweet pies in the Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies. Sweet pies, when they were available, were made with a simple custard base of fresh milk, sugar and eggs. Some of these traditional pies like buttermilk pie, almond custard, Irish potato pie and bean pie (associated with the Nation of Islam) are uncommon in modern times.

==As a comedic device==
In British English, pies thrown or pushed into the face are usually referred to as &quot;custard pies&quot;. Custard pies are used as a comedic device by clowns in many circus performances, in practical jokes for harmless fun and also for throwing into the faces of public figures as a sign of disapproval. UK Saturday morning programme Tiswas had custard pies as a regular feature and even had a character called The Phantom Flan Flinger, a masked man who pied people. The World Custard Pie Throwing Championships take place annually in the village of Coxheath in Kent, England.

<doc id="698717" wikidata="Q910944" url="?curid=698717" title="Speedball (drug)">
<text>Speedball, powerball, or over and under is the polydrug mixture of a stimulant with a depressant, usually an opioid. The most well-known mixture used for recreational drug use is that of cocaine and heroin; however, amphetamines can also be mixed with morphine and/or fentanyl. A speedball may be taken intravenously or by nasal insufflation.

Speedballs often give stronger effects than either drug when taken alone due to drug synergy, and are a particularly hazardous mixture that can easily cause heart attack, respiratory arrest and death. When compared to single drugs, speedballs are more likely to lead to addiction, relapse and overdose.

==History==
The classic speedball is heroin and cocaine. It could also mean morphine and an amphetamine.

The United States Drug Enforcement Administration warned in 2019 that the rapid rise of fentanyl supply in the country has led to combinations of both fentanyl and heroin with cocaine (&quot;super speedballs&quot;). In addition, the cross-contamination of powdered fentanyl into cocaine supplies has led to reports of cocaine users unknowingly consuming a speedball-like combination.

Pink cocaine or &quot;tusi&quot; usually includes an unknown mix of uppers and downers and is sometimes called a speedball. Cocaine mixed with ketamine is called a CK or Calvin Klein.

Reportedly speedballs now account for most of the overdose fatalities in San Francisco. Many people are not speedballing intentionally. Rather, it has become difficult to avoid because so much of the cocaine, crack and methamphetamine supply is adulterated with fentanyl. As of 2023 it is being called the &quot;fourth wave&quot; of the opioid epidemic.

==Physiological response==
It is a widespread misconception that taking downers will reduce the risk of adverse cardiac effects from stimulants, or vice versa. Stimulants and opioids are more dangerous when mixed because they work in different ways. Stimulants wear off before opiates. When heart rate changes quickly, first increasing rapidly from the effect of the stimulant and then dropping quickly when the stimulant wears off and the full effects of the opiates are felt, this can cause a stroke or heart failure. 

Speedballs are extremely dangerous. The variations in heart rate and contraction caused by taking the mix of uppers/downers can lead to stroke or death even in young, healthy persons.

==Notable deaths attributed to speedball use==
*Jean-Michel Basquiat, though other sources list his death as heroin overdose only.
*John Belushi
*Ken Caminiti
*Chris Farley
*Pete Farndon
*Zac Foley
*Trevor Goddard
*Mitch Hedberg
*Philip Seymour Hoffman
*Sebastian Horsley
*DJ Rashad
*Chris Kelly
*Brent Mydland
*River Phoenix
*Judee Sill
*Layne Staley
*Joey Stefano, died from mixing cocaine, morphine, heroin and ketamine.
*Michael K. Williams, died of overdose of a mixture of fentanyl-laced heroin and cocaine.

===Notable incidents of use===
In 1996, Steven Adler had a stroke after taking a speedball, leaving him with a permanent speech impediment. That same year, Dave Gahan suffered a heart attack following a speedball overdose, but survived. According to his autobiography, Slash experienced cardiac arrest for eight minutes after taking a speedball, but was revived.

<doc id="698720" wikidata="Q675721" url="?curid=698720" title="Landau damping">
<text>In physics, Landau damping, named after its discoverer, Soviet physicist Lev Davidovich Landau (1908–68), is the effect of damping (exponential decrease as a function of time) of longitudinal space charge waves in plasma or a similar environment. This phenomenon prevents an instability from developing, and creates a region of stability in the parameter space. It was later argued by Donald Lynden-Bell that a similar phenomenon was occurring in galactic dynamics, where the gas of electrons interacting by electrostatic forces is replaced by a &quot;gas of stars&quot; interacting by gravitational forces. Landau damping can be manipulated exactly in numerical simulations such as particle-in-cell simulation. It was proved to exist experimentally by Malmberg and Wharton in 1964, almost two decades after its prediction by Landau in 1946.

== Wave–particle interactions ==
Landau damping occurs because of the energy exchange between an electromagnetic wave with phase velocity formula_1 and particles in the plasma with velocity approximately equal to formula_1, which can interact strongly with the wave. Those particles having velocities slightly less than formula_1 will be accelerated by the electric field of the wave to move with the wave phase velocity, while those particles with velocities slightly greater than formula_1 will be decelerated losing energy to the wave: particles tend to synchronize with the wave. This is proved experimentally with a traveling-wave tube.

In an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma the particle velocities are often taken to be approximately a Maxwellian distribution function. If the slope of the function is negative, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is greater than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping.
If, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy. Then Landau damping is substituted with Landau growth.

== Physical interpretation ==

The mathematical theory of Landau damping is somewhat involved . However, in the case of waves with finite amplitude, there is a simple physical interpretation which, though not strictly correct, helps to visualize this phenomenon.

It is possible to imagine Langmuir waves as waves in the sea, and the particles as surfers trying to catch the wave, all moving in the same direction. If the surfer is moving on the water surface at a velocity slightly less than the waves they will eventually be caught and pushed along the wave (gaining energy), while a surfer moving slightly faster than a wave will be pushing on the wave as they move uphill (losing energy to the wave).

It is worth noting that only the surfers are playing an important role in this energy interactions with the waves; a beachball floating on the water (zero velocity) will go up and down as the wave goes by, not gaining energy at all. Also, a boat that moves faster than the waves does not exchange much energy with the wave.

A somewhat more detailed picture is obtained by considering particles&#x27; trajectories in phase space, in the wave&#x27;s frame of reference. Particles near the phase velocity become trapped and are forced to move with the wavefronts, at the phase velocity. Any such particles that were initially below the phase velocity have thus been accelerated, while any particles that were initially above the phase velocity have been decelerated. Because, for a Maxwellian plasma, there are initially more particles below the phase velocity than above it, the plasma has net gained energy, and the wave has therefore lost energy.

A simple mechanical description of particle dynamics provides a quantitative estimate of the synchronization of particles with the wave. A more rigorous approach shows the strongest synchronization occurs for particles with a velocity in the wave frame proportional to the damping rate and independent of the wave amplitude. Since Landau damping occurs for waves with arbitrarily small amplitudes, this shows the most active particles in this damping are far from being trapped. This is natural, since trapping involves diverging time scales for such waves (specifically formula_5 for a wave amplitude formula_6).

== Mathematical treatment ==

=== Perturbation theory in a Vlasovian frame ===

Theoretical treatment starts with the Vlasov equation in the non-relativistic zero-magnetic field limit, the Vlasov–Poisson set of equations. Explicit solutions are obtained in the limit of a small formula_7-field. The distribution function formula_8 and field formula_7 are expanded in a series: formula_10, formula_11 and terms of equal order are collected.

To first order the Vlasov–Poisson equations read
formula_12

Landau calculated the wave caused by an initial disturbance formula_13 and found by aid of Laplace transform and contour integration a damped travelling wave of the form formula_14 with wave number formula_15 and damping decrement
formula_16

Here formula_17 is the plasma oscillation frequency and formula_18 is the electron density. Later Nico van Kampen proved that the same result can be obtained with Fourier transform. He showed that the linearized Vlasov–Poisson equations have a continuous spectrum of singular normal modes, now known as van Kampen modes
formula_19
in which formula_20 signifies principal value, formula_21 is the delta function (see generalized function) and
formula_22
is the plasma permittivity. Decomposing the initial disturbance in these modes he obtained the Fourier spectrum of the resulting wave. Damping is explained by phase-mixing of these Fourier modes with slightly different frequencies near formula_17.

It was not clear how damping could occur in a collisionless plasma: where does the wave energy go? In fluid theory, in which the plasma is modeled as a dispersive dielectric medium, the energy of Langmuir waves is known: field energy multiplied by the Brillouin factor formula_24.
But damping cannot be derived in this model. To calculate energy exchange of the wave with resonant electrons, Vlasov plasma theory has to be expanded to second order and problems about suitable initial conditions and secular terms arise.

 In Ref. these problems are studied. Because calculations for an infinite wave are deficient in second order, a wave packet is analysed. Second-order initial conditions are found that suppress secular behavior and excite a wave packet of which the energy agrees with fluid theory. The figure shows the energy density of a wave packet traveling at the group velocity, its energy being carried away by electrons moving at the phase velocity. Total energy, the area under the curves, is conserved.

=== The Cauchy problem for perturbative solutions ===

The rigorous mathematical theory is based on solving the Cauchy problem for the evolution equation (here the partial differential Vlasov–Poisson equation) and proving estimates on the solution.

First a rather complete linearized mathematical theory has been developed since Landau.

Going beyond the linearized equation and dealing with the nonlinearity has been a longstanding problem in the mathematical theory of Landau damping. 
Previously one mathematical result at the non-linear level was the existence of a class of exponentially damped solutions of the Vlasov–Poisson equation in a circle which had been proved in by means of a scattering technique (this result has been recently extended in). However these existence results do not say anything about &quot;which&quot; initial data could lead to such damped solutions.

In a paper published by French mathematicians Cédric Villani and Clément Mouhot, the initial data issue is solved and Landau damping is mathematically established for the first time for the non-linear Vlasov equation. It is proved that solutions starting in some neighborhood (for the analytic or Gevrey topology) of a linearly stable homogeneous stationary solution are (orbitally) stable for all times and are damped globally in time. The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity of formula_8 as a function of formula_26 and formula_27, respectively, rather than exchanges of energy. Large scale variations pass into variations of smaller and smaller scale in velocity space, corresponding to a shift of the Fourier spectrum of formula_8 as a function of formula_27. This shift, well known in linear theory, proves to hold in the non-linear case.

=== Perturbation theory in an &quot;N&quot;-body frame ===

The mechanical &quot;N&quot;-body description, originally deemed impossible, enables a rigorous calculation of Landau damping using Newton’s second law of motion and Fourier series. Neither the Vlasov equation nor Laplace transforms are required for this derivation. The calculation of the energy (more precisely momentum) exchange of the wave with electrons is done similarly. This calculation makes intuitive the interpretation of Landau damping as the synchronization of almost resonant passing particles.

<text>Yarra Trams is the trading name of the operator of the tram network in Melbourne, Australia, which is owned by VicTrack and leased to Yarra Trams by the Victorian Department of Transport and Planning. Since December 2024, the current franchise is operated by Yarra Journey Makers, a joint venture of Transdev and John Holland. 

As at May 2014, Yarra Trams operated 487 trams, across 26 tram routes, including a free City Circle tourist tram, and over 1,763 tram stops. With 250 km (155.3 mi) of double track, Melbourne&#x27;s tram network is the largest in the world. In 2015/16, 203.8 million journeys were taken on Melbourne&#x27;s trams, with trams traveling more than 24.8 million kilometres annually. Each week Yarra Trams operates 31,400 scheduled tram services, which results in trams operating for approximately 20 hours per day and a team of 24-hour operations staff completing network maintenance and cleaning.

==History==

In October 1997, in preparation for privatisation, it was announced that the tram operations of the Public Transport Corporation would be split into two business units, Swanston Trams and Yarra Trams. The split became effective on 1 July 1998.

===TransdevTSL===
MetroLink Victoria Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Transfield Services (50%), Transdev (30%) and Egis (20%), successfully bid to take over the Yarra Trams services from 29 August 1999. Transdev bought out Egis&#x27; share in 2000. MetroLink Victoria became part of TransdevTSL in 2007.

The joint venture inherited 23 W, 31 Z3, 28 A1, 42 A2, two B1 and 55 B2 class trams, and took over the operation of 10 routes and four depots: Camberwell, East Preston, Kew and Southbank. In March 2000 a new white with green and blue stripes and grey skirt livery was introduced.

After National Express, which operated the other half of the network, handed back its M&gt;Tram franchise, having been unable to renegotiate revised financial terms, the State Government temporarily took it over. In May 2003, the State Government announced it would establish a single company to operate both networks, and was negotiating with TransdevTSL to operate it. In February 2004, an agreement was reached, and the networks were reunited on 18 April 2004 under the Yarra Trams brand.

===Keolis Downer===
When the franchise was next tendered, Transdev TSL and Keolis Downer were shortlisted to bid. In June 2009, the franchise was awarded to Keolis Downer with the new franchise commencing on 30 November 2009. The Yarra Trams brand was retained. Keolis Downer introduced a new Yarra Trams logo, along with a new livery featuring yellow doors.

In September 2017, it was announced that the franchise is to be extended until November 2024, but with tougher conditions.

===Yarra Journey Makers===
In June 2024, the Yarra Trams franchise was awarded to Yarra Journey Makers, a joint venture between Transdev (51%) and John Holland (49%). The new operator commenced operations on 1 December 2024 and will continue to use the Yarra Trams brand. It is second time that Transdev has been involved in operating the Yarra Trams network.

==Operations==
===Fleet===

As of January 2019, the fleet consisted of over 450 W, Z3, A1, B2, C1, C2, D and E class trams, operated from eight depots.

In October 2001, Yarra Trams took delivery of the first of 36 C class Alstom Citadis trams which have primarily operated on route 109 to complement the extension to Box Hill. As part of the acquisition of M&gt;Tram in 2004, Yarra Trams acquired 39 D class Siemens Combino trams and oversaw the delivery of another 20 still on order. They are leased from the Commonwealth Bank, rather than VicTrack.

Heritage W-class trams run solely on the City Circle tourist service. Due to these trams being limited to as a result of a series of modifications due to braking problems, their use is restricted to ensure limited interference with modern trams.

In 2003, Yarra Trams trialled a seating layout which became known as &quot;Apollo&quot;. The trial involved removing 30 seats from a B-class tram and replacing the removed seats with &quot;bum racks&quot; which are found in Citadis trams. This resulted in a higher capacity for standing passengers on crowded services during peak hours. A further ten trams received the seating layout during refurbishment.

100 E-class trams were delivered by Bombardier Transportation, Dandenong, between 2013 and 2021.

100 Flexity 2 G-class trams are being manufactured by Alstom, Dandenong, and will be delivered starting from 2025. They will be 3 carriage long trams.

===Ticketing===

Yarra Trams run under the Public Transport Victoria banner, as do other operators of public transport franchises in metropolitan Melbourne, and use the myki ticketing system. Metcard tickets have not been accepted on trams since December 2012, and coin-only Metcard ticket machines and validators have been removed. Seats were installed in place of the ticket machines.

The entire tram network has now changed over to the myki smartcard fare collection system, with passengers needing to buy and top up a valid myki before boarding, or risk a fine of up to $238. Myki cards can be purchased from all staffed railway stations and retail outlets displaying a myki logo, including at all 7-Eleven convenience stores. They cannot be purchased or topped up on board a tram.

All tram routes operate entirely within zone 1. However, routes 75, 86 and 109 enter the zone 1/2 overlap at the very end of their outer-suburban routes. If a passenger begins and ends their journey completely within the zone 1/2 overlap, they can touch off to receive a slightly lower fare. If any part of the journey is within Zone 1, there is no need for the passenger to touch off as the fare is automatically calculated. Touching off on a zone 1 journey is both redundant and may cause delay or inconvenience to other passengers and the tram networks &#x27;on time&#x27; performance. If passengers only travel in the free tram zone, there is no need to touch on their myki.

===Network expansion===
Since privatisation, the tram network has grown in size as a result of a number of extensions. The accessibility of the network has also been improved, with 360 platform stops built as of January 2014.

In March 2000, services were extended to the new Melbourne Docklands precinct. Since then, a line connecting La Trobe and Flinders Streets via Docklands has been constructed as well as a further extension along Docklands Drive to NewQuay, which opened in January 2005. route 109 was extended from Mont Albert to Box Hill in May 2003. The extension to Box Hill has provided a direct link between Box Hill and suburbs such as Balwyn, Kew and Richmond.

In July 2005, a extension of route 75 from Burwood East to Vermont South opened.

In April 2018, the state government announced a new extension of the tram network from Caulfield. The 18 km (11.1 mi) extension would serve Chadstone, Monash University, Waverley Park and Rowville. The state government allocated $3 million to plan the route, which would be carried out in two stages.

===Think Tram===

Yarra Trams is a partner in the Think Tram program with VicRoads, aimed at improving tram travel time and reliability. In conjunction with the Victorian government several initiatives are in place to enable trams to better meet punctuality targets. These include &#x27;T-lights&#x27; which give trams priority at traffic signals, as well as part-time tram lanes and full-time tram lanes.

Part-time tram lanes are used often only during peak hours, with an example of this being on High Street along the route 6. Vehicles must not enter a part-time tram lane at any point during the nominated times except to avoid an obstruction, or perform a right turn; even then, vehicles must not proceed by law into the lane to do so unless they will not delay any approaching tram/s from either direction. The limit for staying in the lane to avoid an obstruction or turn right is 50 metres, at which point a vehicle must exit the lane entirely.

Full-time tram lanes often utilise raised curb dividers to physically prevent cars from straying onto tram tracks. Examples of these dividers can be seen on Spencer Street, Swanston Street in Carlton and Fitzroy Street in St Kilda. Vehicles must not enter a full-time tram lane at any time except to avoid an obstruction; even then, vehicles must not proceed by law into the lane to do so unless they will not delay any approaching tram/s from either direction. The limit for staying in the lane to avoid an obstruction is 50 metres, at which point a vehicle must exit the lane entirely. Some lanes only allow this to occur at certain points, or breaks, in the raised dividers. Crossing the raised dividers otherwise can cause severe damage to a vehicle.

===Beware the Rhino===
In May 2011, Yarra Trams launched its &quot;Beware The Rhino&quot; safety campaign, aiming to increase awareness of the danger of tram traffic. It compared the hazard of a charging of rhinoceros to that of a tram, highlighting the peril that people put themselves in when they step into the path of a tram. The campaign won creativity awards, and was refocused in 2013.

==Legislation and governance==
=== Transport Integration Act===
The prime transport-related statute in Victoria is the &quot;Transport Integration Act 2010&quot;, which establishes the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria&#x27;s transport system. The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with providing public transport rail services, namely the Public Transport Development Authority. The PTDA is empowered by the Transport Integration Act to contract transport operators to provide rail and bus services and has used those powers to contract Yarra Trams to provide tram services in Melbourne.

In addition, the &quot;Transport Integration Act&quot; establishes VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the &quot;Rail Management Act 1996&quot; which confers powers on rail operators and provides for an access scheme for the state&#x27;s rail network. The &quot;Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous Act) 1983&quot; is also a relevant statute relating to public transport and contains a number of offences relating to safety, ticketing and amenity.

===Rail Safety Act===
The safety of rail transport operations in Melbourne is regulated by the &quot;Rail Safety Act 2006&quot; which applies to all commercial passenger operations. This Act establishes a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations. Accredited operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations. Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne including trams is the Director, Transport Safety (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the Transport Integration Act 2010.

<text>The 1965–66 Bundesliga was the third season of the Bundesliga, West Germany&#x27;s premier football league. It began on 14 August 1965 and ended on 28 May 1966. Werder Bremen were the defending champions.

==Competition modus==
Every team played two games against each other team, one at home and one away. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw. If two or more teams were tied on points, places were determined by goal average. The team with the most points were crowned champions while the two teams with the fewest points were relegated to their respective Regionalliga divisions.

==Team changes to 1964–65==
Karlsruher SC and FC Schalke 04 would initially have been relegated for finishing in the bottom two places. However, Hertha BSC were found guilty of illegal financial behavior and, as a consequence, had their Bundesliga license revoked. The German FA then decided to keep Karlsruhe and Schalke in the league and expand its size to 18 teams. Bayern Munich and Borussia Mönchengladbach were promoted after having won their respective promotion play-off groups. In order to still have a representative from West Berlin in the league, the amateur side Tasmania Berlin were also granted promotion.

==Season overview==
The 1965–66 season was the inaugural season for two of the most successful clubs regarding league titles in Bundesliga history, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayern Munich. It was also the first time that a city had two clubs in the Bundesliga. Bayern were a title contender for large parts of the season, but eventually were held short three points by their cross-town rivals 1860, who won their first championship. Nevertheless, the newcomers had something to celebrate as well, as they won the DFB Cup one week after the end of the season, which they finished in third place.

Borussia Dortmund finished in second place, ahead on goal average to Bayern Munich. They also had huge title chances until late in the season, but were beaten 2–0 at home by 1860 on the second-to-last match day. However, Dortmund did not end the season without a title as well, as they beat Liverpool 2–1 after extra time in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final at Glasgow&#x27;s Hampden Park three days earlier. It marked the first time that a German club had won a European championship.

At the other end of the table, another famous German club had a historic season as well – but in the worst way possible. Tasmania Berlin were added to the league just two weeks before the start of the season after city rivals Hertha BSC had been thrown out on financial irregularities. They were not even first choice for a replacement as the Berlin representative, as they had only finished in third place in Regionalliga Berlin. But when champions Tennis Borussia were considered too weak after failing in the promotion play-off rounds and therefore were not asked, and runners-up Spandauer SV declined their interest in a Bundesliga spot as well, Tasmania gladly accepted the invitation by the German FA.

The decision turned out to be a fatal one for the club. Tasmania&#x27;s team was never capable of competing in the Bundesliga. They set up a various number of records, including, among others, lowest point total (8), fewest wins (2), most losses (28), fewest goals scored (15), most goals against (108) and lowest match attendance for a Bundesliga game (827 against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 15 January 1966). Most of the records are still intact.

<text>The 1966–67 Bundesliga was the fourth season of the Bundesliga, West Germany&#x27;s premier football league. It began on 20 August 1966 and ended on 3 June 1967. 1860 Munich were the defending champions.

==Competition modus==
Every team played two games against each other team, one at home and one away. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw. If two or more teams were tied on points, places were determined by goal average. The team with the most points were crowned champions while the two teams with the fewest points were relegated to their respective Regionalliga divisions.

==Team changes to 1965–66==
Borussia Neunkirchen and Tasmania Berlin were relegated to the Regionalliga after finishing in the last two places. They were replaced by Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen, who won their respective promotion play-off groups.

==Season overview==
The 1966–67 season was surprisingly won by Eintracht Braunschweig. The Lower Saxony side, located near the border to the Soviet occupation zone, had previously been a mid-table team and were not expected to have anything to do with the title race before the season. But a strong defense, which only allowed 27 goals in 34 games, an unexpectedly even-balanced league and struggling opposition (for example, runners-up 1860 Munich were in 17th place after one third of the season before starting a comeback) eventually benefitted the team of coach Helmuth Johannsen.

In European competitions, the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup was transferred from Dortmund to another West German team as FC Bayern beat Rangers from Scotland on a Franz Roth goal in the final at Nuremberg. The team from Munich also defended their domestic cup title, enabling finalists Hamburger SV, who finished the season in a dismal 14th place, to enter the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup as well.

At the bottom side of the table, newly promoted sides Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen had to leave the league again after only one year. The competitional differences between the professional Bundesliga and the semi-professional Regionalligen had already become very difficult to compensate so that the demotion of both teams was inevitable the more the season continued.

On a minor note, Meidericher SV was renamed MSV Duisburg effective to the start of the year 1967.

<text>The Kosovo-Pomoravlje District was a district of Kosovo and Metohija, part of the Republic of Serbia. The region is called Kosovo Pomoravlje. The area now has a population of 184,864. Before the NATO intervention in the Kosovo War, 20.000 Serbs lived in Gjilan. The seat of the district was in the city of Gjilan. Along with the rest of Kosovo , it was transferred to UN administration, a situation accepted by the Serbian government. In 2000 the UN administration renamed the district the District of Gjilan as part of a series of reforms, which were rejected by Serbia.

<text>The 1967–68 Bundesliga was the fifth season of the Bundesliga, West Germany&#x27;s premier football league. It began on 18 August 1967 and ended on 28 May 1968. Eintracht Braunschweig were the defending champions.

==Competition modus==
Every team played two games against each other team, one at home and one away. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw. If two or more teams were tied on points, places were determined by goal average. The team with the most points were crowned champions while the two teams with the fewest points were relegated to their respective Regionalliga divisions.

==Team changes to 1967–68==
Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen were relegated to the Regionalliga after finishing in the last two places. They were replaced by Alemannia Aachen and Borussia Neunkirchen, who won their respective promotion play-off groups.

==Season overview==
The 1967–68 season began with an innovation: it was now permissible for teams to substitute out one player &quot;per&quot; match. Although such a move was only permitted in case of an injury, it was soon used by the coaches for tactical changes as well.

The title was won by 1. FC Nürnberg. The team, led by head coach Max Merkel, consistently collected points and were seven points clear after half the season played. Even a slight collapse near the end of the season could not jeopardize the first Nürnberg Bundesliga title, which also was a record ninth German championship overall for the club.

In European competitions, the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup saw both West German teams advance into the semi-finals. It needed Italian club Milan to prevent a title hat-trick for Bundesliga sides, eliminating title holders Bayern Munich 2–0 on aggregate before beating Hamburger SV, who were the fourth West German team in the final in four consecutive years, at Rotterdam&#x27;s Feijenoord Stadion by the same score. Hamburg had reached the final by beating Welsh side Cardiff City 4–3 on aggregate. The achievement eased the disappointment on another lackluster season by the club from North Germany, who finished its campaign only in 13th place.

The bottom side of the table saw an early decision in the relegation race. Borussia Neunkirchen and Karlsruher SC were demoted to the Regionalliga with four matchdays to play. Both teams clearly lacked quality players on both sides of the pitch, as they provided the poorest attacks and defences of all clubs.

<doc id="698755" wikidata="Q1009512" url="?curid=698755" title="George Wassouf">
<text>George Wassouf (; 23 December 1961) is a Syrian singer. In a career spanning more than four decades, he has released more than 30 albums, with a significantly large audience of fans throughout the Arab world. Dubbed Sultan El-Tarab (), he is one of the most successful Arab singers selling over 60 million records worldwide.

==Early life and career==
Wassouf was born in Kafroun, Syria to a Greek Orthodox Christian family. Wassouf started singing at the age of 10 in his hometown Kafroun. He was discovered by his first manager and producer George Yazbeck at a wedding party that Wassouf was performing at, aged 12 years old. At the age of 16, he was called &quot;Sultan El-Tarab&quot; (&quot;The Sultan of Music&quot;) by the Lebanese journalist George Ibrahim El Khoury, a magazine director, with his classic song &quot;el-Hawa Sultan&quot;. At age 19, he appeared on the 1980 Lebanese show &quot;Studio El Fan&quot; as &quot;Sultan of Tarab&quot;. Wassouf also holds Lebanese citizenship.

Wassouf preferred not to shoot music videos for his songs saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I can act... I really can&#x27;t... I only find myself when I&#x27;m on the stage... singing, but the video clip forces me to act&quot;.

==Personal life==
George Wassouf married his first wife, Shalimar, at the age of 21. They have three children: Wadih, Hatem and George Jr. The couple separated after 28 years of marriage in 2009. On January 6, 2023, their eldest son Wadih died due to complications from a gastric bypass surgery.

In 2014, he married Qatar rally champion Nada Zeidan, his second wife. They divorced in 2016. Their daughter, Oyoon, was born in October 2015. 

Wassouf was a prominent supporter of President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government throughout the Syrian Civil War.

In 2008, he was arrested in Sweden for possession of cocaine.

<text>&quot;Widsith&quot; (, &quot;far-traveller&quot;, lit. &quot;wide-journey&quot;), also known as &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Song&quot;, is an Old English poem of 143 lines. It survives only in the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; (&quot;pages 84v–87r&quot;), a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late-10th century, which contains approximately one-sixth of all surviving Old English poetry. &quot;Widsith&quot; is located between the poems &quot;Vainglory&quot; and &quot;The Fortunes of Men&quot;. Since the donation of the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; in 1076, it has been housed in Exeter Cathedral in southwestern England. The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the Heroic Age of Northern Europe.

==Date of composition==
There is some controversy as to when &quot;Widsith&quot; was first composed. Some historians, such as John Niles, argue that the work was invented after King Alfred&#x27;s rule to present &quot;a common glorious past&quot;, while others, such as Kemp Malone, have argued that the piece is an authentic transcription of old heroic songs. Among the works appearing in the &quot;Exeter Book&quot;, there are none quite like &quot;Widsith&quot;, which may be by far the oldest extant work that gives a historical account of the Battle of the Goths and the Huns, recounted as legends in later Scandinavian works such as the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. Archaeologist Lotte Hedeager argues that &quot;Widsith&quot; goes back to Migration Age-history—at least part of it was composed in the 6th century, and that the author demonstrates familiarity with regions outside of Britain, including Denmark and the Baltic coast. Hedeager is here in agreement with R.H. Hodgkin and Leonard Neidorf, who argues that &quot;when situated within the history of Anglo-Saxon culture and identity, &#x27;Widsith&#x27; clearly belongs to a time prior to the formation of a collective Anglo-Saxon identity, when distinct continental origins were remembered and maintained by the Germanic migrants in the British Isles&quot;.

==Contents==
Excluding the introduction of the &quot;scop&quot; Widsith, the closing, and brief comments regarded by some scholars as interpolations, the poem is divided into three &#x27;catalogues&#x27;, so-called &quot;thulas&quot;. The first &quot;thula&quot; runs through a list of the various kings of renown, both contemporary and ancient (&quot;Caesar ruled the Greeks&quot;), the model being &#x27;(name of a king) ruled (name of a tribe)&#x27;. The second &quot;thula&quot; contains the names of the peoples the narrator visited, the model being &#x27;With the (name of a tribe) I was, and with the (name of another tribe)&#x27;. In the third and final &quot;thula&quot;, the narrator lists the heroes of myth and legend that he has visited, with the model &#x27;(Hero&#x27;s name) I sought and (hero&#x27;s name) and (hero&#x27;s name)&#x27;.

The poem refers to a group of people called the &quot;Wicinga cynn&quot;, which may be the earliest mention of the word &quot;Viking&quot; (lines 47, 59, 80). It closes with a brief comment on the importance and fame offered by poets like Widsith, with many pointed reminders of the munificent generosity offered to tale-singers by patrons &quot;discerning of songs&quot;.
The widely travelled poet Widsith (his name simply means &quot;far journey&quot;) claims himself to be of the house of the Myrgings, who had first set out in the retinue of &quot;Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Angeln to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker&quot;. The Ostrogoth Eormanric was defeated by the Huns in the 4th century. It is moot whether Widsith literally intends himself, or poetically means his lineage, either as a Myrging or as a poet, as when &quot;the fictive speaker Deor uses the rhetoric of first-person address to insert himself into the same legendary world that he evokes in the earlier parts of the poem through his allusions to Wayland the Smith, Theodoric the Goth, Eormanric the Goth, and other legendary figures of the Germanic past&quot;. Historically, we know that one speaker could not travel to see all of these nations in one lifetime. In a similar vein, &quot;I was with the Lidwicingas, the Leonas, and the Langobards&quot;, Widsith boasts,
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
with heathens and heroes and with the Hundingas.
I was with the Israelites and with the Assyrians,
with the Hebrews and the Indians, and with the Egyptians...
&lt;/poem&gt;

The forests of the Vistula in the ancient writing tradition &quot;(Widsith, v. 121)&quot; are the homeland of the Goths, the material remains of which are generally associated with the Wielbark Culture.
The poem that is now similarly titled &quot;Deor&quot;, also from the Exeter Book, draws on similar material.

==Tribes of Widsith==
The list of kings of tribes is sorted by &quot;fame and importance&quot;, according to Hedeager, with Attila of the Huns coming first, followed immediately by Eormanric of the Ostrogoths; by contrast, the Byzantine emperor is number five.

<doc id="698759" wikidata="Q302518" url="?curid=698759" title="Propagator">
<text>In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, the propagator is a function that specifies the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from one place to another in a given period of time, or to travel with a certain energy and momentum. In Feynman diagrams, which serve to calculate the rate of collisions in quantum field theory, virtual particles contribute their propagator to the rate of the scattering event described by the respective diagram. Propagators may also be viewed as the inverse of the wave operator appropriate to the particle, and are, therefore, often called &quot;(causal) Green&#x27;s functions&quot; (called &quot;causal&quot; to distinguish it from the elliptic Laplacian Green&#x27;s function).

==Non-relativistic propagators==
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the propagator gives the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from one spatial point (x&#x27;) at one time (t&#x27;) to another spatial point (x) at a later time (t).

The Green&#x27;s function G for the Schrödinger equation is a function
formula_1
satisfying
formula_2
where denotes the Hamiltonian, denotes the Dirac delta-function and is the Heaviside step function. The kernel of the above Schrödinger differential operator in the big parentheses is denoted by and called the propagator.

This propagator may also be written as the transition amplitude
formula_3
where is the unitary time-evolution operator for the system taking states at time to states at time . Note the initial condition enforced by
formula_4
The propagator may also be found by using a path integral:
: formula_5
where denotes the Lagrangian and the boundary conditions are given by . The paths that are summed over move only forwards in time and are integrated with the differential formula_6 following the path in time.

The propagator lets one find the wave function of a system, given an initial wave function and a time interval. The new wave function is given by
: formula_7
If only depends on the difference , this is a convolution of the initial wave function and the propagator.

===Examples===

For a time-translationally invariant system, the propagator only depends on the time difference , so it may be rewritten as
formula_8

The propagator of a one-dimensional free particle, obtainable from, e.g., the path integral, is then
 = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi i\hbar t}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} e^{-\frac{m(x-x&#x27;)^2}{2i\hbar t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor = #F9FFF7}}

Similarly, the propagator of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is the Mehler kernel, 
 \exp\left(-\frac{m\omega\big((x^2 + x&#x27;^2) \cos\omega t - 2xx&#x27;\big)}{2i\hbar \sin\omega t}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor = #F9FFF7}}
The latter may be obtained from the previous free-particle result upon making use of van Kortryk&#x27;s SU(1,1) Lie-group identity,
formula_9
valid for operators formula_10 and formula_11 satisfying the Heisenberg relation formula_12.

For the -dimensional case, the propagator can be simply obtained by the product
formula_13

==Relativistic propagators==
In relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the propagators are Lorentz-invariant. They give the amplitude for a particle to travel between two spacetime events.

===Scalar propagator===
In quantum field theory, the theory of a free (or non-interacting) scalar field is a useful and simple example which serves to illustrate the concepts needed for more complicated theories. It describes spin-zero particles. There are a number of possible propagators for free scalar field theory. We now describe the most common ones.

=== Position space ===
The position space propagators are Green&#x27;s functions for the Klein–Gordon equation. This means that they are functions satisfying
formula_14
where
* are two points in Minkowski spacetime,
* formula_15 is the d&#x27;Alembertian operator acting on the coordinates,
* is the Dirac delta function.

(As typical in relativistic quantum field theory calculations, we use units where the speed of light and the reduced Planck constant are set to unity.)

We shall restrict attention to 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We can perform a Fourier transform of the equation for the propagator, obtaining
formula_16

This equation can be inverted in the sense of distributions, noting that the equation has the solution (see Sokhotski–Plemelj theorem)
formula_17
with implying the limit to zero. Below, we discuss the right choice of the sign arising from causality requirements.

The solution is
{p^2 - m^2 \pm i\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
where 
formula_18 
is the 4-vector inner product.

The different choices for how to deform the integration contour in the above expression lead to various forms for the propagator. The choice of contour is usually phrased in terms of the formula_19 integral.

The integrand then has two poles at 
formula_20 
so different choices of how to avoid these lead to different propagators.

=== Causal propagators ===

==== Retarded propagator ====
A contour going clockwise over both poles gives the causal retarded propagator. This is zero if is spacelike or is to the future of , so it is zero if .

This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limit,
formula_21

Here 
formula_22
is the Heaviside step function,
formula_23
is the proper time from to , and formula_24 is a Bessel function of the first kind. The propagator is non-zero only if formula_25, i.e., causally precedes , which, for Minkowski spacetime, means
:formula_26 and formula_27

This expression can be related to the vacuum expectation value of the commutator of the free scalar field operator,
formula_28
where 
formula_29

==== Advanced propagator ====
A contour going anti-clockwise under both poles gives the causal advanced propagator. This is zero if is spacelike or if is to the past of , so it is zero if .

This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limit
formula_30

This expression can also be expressed in terms of the vacuum expectation value of the commutator of the free scalar field.
In this case,
formula_31

====Feynman propagator====
A contour going under the left pole and over the right pole gives the Feynman propagator, introduced by Richard Feynman in 1948.

This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limit 
formula_32

Here, is a Hankel function and is a modified Bessel function.

This expression can be derived directly from the field theory as the vacuum expectation value of the &quot;time-ordered product&quot; of the free scalar field, that is, the product always taken such that the time ordering of the spacetime points is the same,
formula_33

This expression is Lorentz invariant, as long as the field operators commute with one another when the points and are separated by a spacelike interval.

The usual derivation is to insert a complete set of single-particle momentum states between the fields with Lorentz covariant normalization, and then to show that the functions providing the causal time ordering may be obtained by a contour integral along the energy axis, if the integrand is as above (hence the infinitesimal imaginary part), to move the pole off the real line.

The propagator may also be derived using the path integral formulation of quantum theory.

==== Dirac propagator ====
Introduced by Paul Dirac in 1938.

===Momentum space propagator===
The Fourier transform of the position space propagators can be thought of as propagators in momentum space. These take a much simpler form than the position space propagators.

They are often written with an explicit term although this is understood to be a reminder about which integration contour is appropriate (see above). This term is included to incorporate boundary conditions and causality (see below).

For a 4-momentum the causal and Feynman propagators in momentum space are:

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36

For purposes of Feynman diagram calculations, it is usually convenient to write these with an additional overall factor of (conventions vary).

===Faster than light?===

The Feynman propagator has some properties that seem baffling at first. In particular, unlike the commutator, the propagator is &quot;nonzero&quot; outside of the light cone, though it falls off rapidly for spacelike intervals. Interpreted as an amplitude for particle motion, this translates to the virtual particle travelling faster than light. It is not immediately obvious how this can be reconciled with causality: can we use faster-than-light virtual particles to send faster-than-light messages?

The answer is no: while in classical mechanics the intervals along which particles and causal effects can travel are the same, this is no longer true in quantum field theory, where it is commutators that determine which operators can affect one another.

So what &quot;does&quot; the spacelike part of the propagator represent? In QFT the vacuum is an active participant, and particle numbers and field values are related by an uncertainty principle; field values are uncertain even for particle number &quot;zero&quot;. There is a nonzero probability amplitude to find a significant fluctuation in the vacuum value of the field if one measures it locally (or, to be more precise, if one measures an operator obtained by averaging the field over a small region). Furthermore, the dynamics of the fields tend to favor spatially correlated fluctuations to some extent. The nonzero time-ordered product for spacelike-separated fields then just measures the amplitude for a nonlocal correlation in these vacuum fluctuations, analogous to an EPR correlation. Indeed, the propagator is often called a &quot;two-point correlation function&quot; for the free field.

Since, by the postulates of quantum field theory, all observable operators commute with each other at spacelike separation, messages can no more be sent through these correlations than they can through any other EPR correlations; the correlations are in random variables.

Regarding virtual particles, the propagator at spacelike separation can be thought of as a means of calculating the amplitude for creating a virtual particle-antiparticle pair that eventually disappears into the vacuum, or for detecting a virtual pair emerging from the vacuum. In Feynman&#x27;s language, such creation and annihilation processes are equivalent to a virtual particle wandering backward and forward through time, which can take it outside of the light cone. However, no signaling back in time is allowed.

====Explanation using limits====
This can be made clearer by writing the propagator in the following form for a massless particle:
formula_37

This is the usual definition but normalised by a factor of formula_38. Then the rule is that one only takes the limit formula_39 at the end of a calculation.

One sees that 
formula_40
and
formula_41
Hence this means that a single massless particle will always stay on the light cone. It is also shown that the total probability for a photon at any time must be normalised by the reciprocal of the following factor:
formula_42
We see that the parts outside the light cone usually are zero in the limit and only are important in Feynman diagrams.

===Propagators in Feynman diagrams===
The most common use of the propagator is in calculating probability amplitudes for particle interactions using Feynman diagrams. These calculations are usually carried out in momentum space. In general, the amplitude gets a factor of the propagator for every &quot;internal line&quot;, that is, every line that does not represent an incoming or outgoing particle in the initial or final state. It will also get a factor proportional to, and similar in form to, an interaction term in the theory&#x27;s Lagrangian for every internal vertex where lines meet. These prescriptions are known as &quot;Feynman rules&quot;.

Internal lines correspond to virtual particles. Since the propagator does not vanish for combinations of energy and momentum disallowed by the classical equations of motion, we say that the virtual particles are allowed to be off shell. In fact, since the propagator is obtained by inverting the wave equation, in general, it will have singularities on shell.

The energy carried by the particle in the propagator can even be &quot;negative&quot;. This can be interpreted simply as the case in which, instead of a particle going one way, its antiparticle is going the &quot;other&quot; way, and therefore carrying an opposing flow of positive energy. The propagator encompasses both possibilities. It does mean that one has to be careful about minus signs for the case of fermions, whose propagators are not even functions in the energy and momentum (see below).

Virtual particles conserve energy and momentum. However, since they can be off shell, wherever the diagram contains a closed &quot;loop&quot;, the energies and momenta of the virtual particles participating in the loop will be partly unconstrained, since a change in a quantity for one particle in the loop can be balanced by an equal and opposite change in another. Therefore, every loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integral over a continuum of possible energies and momenta. In general, these integrals of products of propagators can diverge, a situation that must be handled by the process of renormalization.

===Other theories===
==== Spin ====
If the particle possesses spin then its propagator is in general somewhat more complicated, as it will involve the particle&#x27;s spin or polarization indices. The differential equation satisfied by the propagator for a spin particle is given by

:formula_43

where is the unit matrix in four dimensions, and employing the Feynman slash notation. This is the Dirac equation for a delta function source in spacetime. Using the momentum representation,
formula_44
the equation becomes

: formula_45

where on the right-hand side an integral representation of the four-dimensional delta function is used. Thus

:formula_46

By multiplying from the left with
formula_47
(dropping unit matrices from the notation) and using properties of the gamma matrices,
formula_48

the momentum-space propagator used in Feynman diagrams for a Dirac field representing the electron in quantum electrodynamics is found to have form

:formula_49

The downstairs is a prescription for how to handle the poles in the complex -plane. It automatically yields the Feynman contour of integration by shifting the poles appropriately. It is sometimes written

:formula_50

for short. It should be remembered that this expression is just shorthand notation for . &quot;One over matrix&quot; is otherwise nonsensical. In position space one has
formula_51

This is related to the Feynman propagator by

:formula_52

where formula_53.

==== Spin 1 ====
The propagator for a gauge boson in a gauge theory depends on the choice of convention to fix the gauge. For the gauge used by Feynman and Stueckelberg, the propagator for a photon is
:formula_54

The general form with gauge parameter , up to overall sign and the factor of formula_55, reads
:formula_56

The propagator for a massive vector field can be derived from the Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The general form with gauge parameter , up to overall sign and the factor of formula_55, reads
:formula_58

With these general forms one obtains the propagators in unitary gauge for , the propagator in Feynman or &#x27;t Hooft gauge for and in Landau or Lorenz gauge for . There are also other notations where the gauge parameter is the inverse of , usually denoted (see gauges). The name of the propagator, however, refers to its final form and not necessarily to the value of the gauge parameter.

Unitary gauge:
:formula_59

Feynman (&#x27;t Hooft) gauge:
:formula_60

Landau (Lorenz) gauge:
:formula_61

===Graviton propagator===
The graviton propagator for Minkowski space in general relativity is 
formula_62
where formula_63 is the number of spacetime dimensions, formula_64 is the transverse and traceless spin-2 projection operator and formula_65 is a spin-0 scalar multiplet. 
The graviton propagator for (Anti) de Sitter space is 
formula_66
where formula_67 is the Hubble constant. Note that upon taking the limit formula_68 and formula_69, the AdS propagator reduces to the Minkowski propagator.

==Related singular functions==

The scalar propagators are Green&#x27;s functions for the Klein–Gordon equation. There are related singular functions which are important in quantum field theory. These functions are most simply defined in terms of the vacuum expectation value of products of field operators.

===Solutions to the Klein–Gordon equation===
====Pauli–Jordan function====
The commutator of two scalar field operators defines the Pauli–Jordan function formula_70 by

:formula_71
with
:formula_72

This satisfies 
:formula_73 
and is zero if formula_74.

====Positive and negative frequency parts (cut propagators)====
We can define the positive and negative frequency parts of formula_70, sometimes called cut propagators, in a relativistically invariant way.

This allows us to define the positive frequency part:
:formula_76

and the negative frequency part:
:formula_77

These satisfy 
:formula_78

and
:formula_79

====Auxiliary function====
The anti-commutator of two scalar field operators defines formula_80 function by
:formula_81
with
:formula_82

This satisfies formula_83

===Green&#x27;s functions for the Klein–Gordon equation===
The retarded, advanced and Feynman propagators defined above are all Green&#x27;s functions for the Klein–Gordon equation.

They are related to the singular functions by
:formula_84
:formula_85
:formula_86
where formula_87 is the sign of formula_88.

<text>The Institute for International Assistance and Solidarity (IFIAS) is an international non-governmental organization with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, working for the promotion of democracy, transparency and human rights.

It was registered under Belgian law as a non-profit organization in 1997, but its roots date from the late 1970s in Germany: There it was found in Bonn by former German chancellor Willy Brandt and Gerd Greune in 1979 to support democratic forces and establish exchange with civil society in the countries of the Warsaw Pact.

After the fall of the Iron Curtain, IFIAS created networks and conducted projects to help the former communist countries in their transition to democracy and pluralism, which provisionally culminated with the admission of ten new members to the European Union on May 1, 2004.

Besides that, IFIAS was active in the field of humanitarian aid during and following the civil wars in the Balkans. Especially in Germany, IFIAS organized fund-raising and transports of humanitarian aid goods to the conflict region as well as assisting and counseling refugees. In addition to that, IFIAS conducted projects in Chechnya, both for humanitarian aid and democratization (due to the political situation, this work could not be continued). In recent years, the focus of IFIAS&#x27; work has also shifted towards media projects and the protection of the freedom of speech in former communist countries.

Besides the headquarters in Brussels, IFIAS has offices in Bonn and Berlin (Germany), and in Belgrade (Serbia &amp; Montenegro).

<text>Thomas Walter Turrentine, Jr. (April 22, 1928 – May 13, 1997) was a swing and hard bop trumpeter and composer who was active between the 1940s and the 1960s. He rarely worked as a bandleader, and was known for his work as a sideman with drummer Max Roach and his younger brother, the saxophonist Stanley Turrentine.

==Biography==
Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Turrentine played in the bands of Benny Carter, Earl Bostic, Charles Mingus, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie, and Count Basie. He later recorded with Sonny Clark, Lou Donaldson, and his brother Stanley&#x27;s bands. His working relationship with Max Roach was spawned in part when he joined the Max Roach Quintet in the late 1950s. Turrentine was also adept on the piano at chord blockings and was a compositional exponent of Thelonious Monk&#x27;s earlier chordal voicings. His bebop compositions combined a sophisticated and emotional fusion and poignant lyricism reminiscent of Benny Golson and with the passionate, spirited influence of the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet.

While his brother had a successful career and recorded a number of albums over his lifetime, Tommy only recorded one album under his name before retiring in the 1960s. In the 1970s he lived on the ground floor of a brownstone with his wife, Jane on West 82nd Street in New York City, a street which during that period had a number of jazz luminaries living along its blocks between Broadway and Central Park, including Tommy Flanagan and Pharoah Sanders.

Tommy Turrentine was rarely active after the 1970s. In the summer of 1979, he was one of several star trumpeters (including Jon Faddis and others) who appeared at the Village Gate for an all-star tribute to Blue Mitchell who had died earlier that year. Turrentine also appeared on the 1989 album &quot;Blue Delight&quot; by keyboardist Sun Ra.

He died of cancer at the age of 69.

<text>The Strachan Open was a professional snooker tournament held between 1992 and 1994. It had varying ranking status during its history.

== History ==
The tournament was first held in 1992, and was a ranking tournament. It was sponsored by billiard cloth company Strachan. The event was boycotted by several top players due to lower points tariff and prize money. The final stages were played at the Thornbury Leisure Centre in Thornbury. Peter Ebdon made his first official maximum break in the qualifying rounds against Wayne Martin.

The following season to encourage the new professional, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association created four so-called &quot;minor ranking events&quot;. These tournaments were open to every professional, but earned only one-tenth of the ranking points of most other ranking tournaments. Three of the four minor ranking events were &quot;Strachan Challenges&quot;. The fourth was the Benson &amp; Hedges Championship. Most of the top sixteen players did not bother to enter. The Strachan Challenges continued for one more season with two events, but they did not carry ranking points.

<doc id="698793" wikidata="Q1492328" url="?curid=698793" title="Bile acid sequestrant">
<text>The bile acid sequestrants are a group of resins used to bind certain components of bile in the gastrointestinal tract. They disrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by combining with bile constituents and preventing their reabsorption from the gut. In general, they are classified as hypolipidemic agents, although they may be used for purposes other than lowering cholesterol. They are used in the treatment of chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption.

==Mechanism==
Bile acid sequestrants are polymeric compounds that serve as ion-exchange resins. Bile acid sequestrants exchange anions such as chloride ions for bile acids. By doing so, they bind bile acids and sequester them from the enterohepatic circulation. The liver then produces more bile acids to replace those that have been lost. Because the body uses cholesterol to make bile acids, this reduces the level of LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood.

Bile acid sequestrants are large polymeric structures, and they are not significantly absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Thus, bile acid sequestrants, along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.

==Medical uses==

===Hyperlipidemia===
As bile acids are biosynthesized from cholesterol, disruption of bile acid reabsorption will decrease cholesterol levels, in particular, low-density lipoprotein (commonly known as &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;) in blood. Consequently, these drugs have been used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia.

Use of these agents as hypolipidemic agents has decreased markedly since the introduction of the statins, which are more efficacious than bile acid sequestrants at lowering LDL. They are occasionally used as an adjunct to the statins as an alternative to the fibrates (another major group of cholesterol-lowering drugs), which are thought to increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis when used with statins. The bile-acid-binding resins can raise triglycerides modestly (about 5%) and cannot be used if the triglycerides are elevated.

===Bile acid malabsorption===
Chronic diarrhea may be caused by excess bile salts entering the colon rather than being absorbed at the end of the small intestine (the ileum). This condition of bile acid malabsorption occurs after surgery to the ileum, in Crohn&#x27;s disease, with a number of other gastrointestinal causes, or is commonly a primary, idiopathic condition. The SeHCAT test can be used for diagnosis. Bile salt diarrhea can also be a side-effect of gallbladder removal.

Bile acid sequestrants are the principal therapy for bile acid-induced diarrhea. Cholestyramine, colestipol and colesevelam have all been used. Doses may not need to be as high as those previously used for hyperlipidemia. Many patients find them hard to tolerate, as although the diarrhea may improve, bloating and abdominal pain can worsen.

===Use in other conditions===
In chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, bile acids may deposit in the skin, causing pruritus (itching). Hence, bile acid sequestrants may be used for the prevention of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease.

Bile acid sequestrants may also be used to treat hyperthyroidism as an adjunct therapy. By inhibiting the enterohepatic circulation, more L-thyroxine will be lost through defecation, thus lowering body thyroxine levels.

Cholestyramine has been used in the treatment of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infections, in order to absorb toxins A and B.

==Side effects==
As bile acid sequestrants are designed to stay in the gut; in general, they do not have systemic side effects. However, they may cause problems in the gastrointestinal tract, such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence. Some patients complain of the bad taste.

Because bile acid sequestrants are not well-absorbed from the gut, they are generally regarded as safe in pregnant women. However, by interfering with vitamin absorption (see below), they could cause vitamin deficiencies that may affect the fetus. So, vitamin supplementation may be considered, with appropriate intervals between dosing of the vitamins and bile acid sequestrants.

==Drug interactions==
In addition to bile acids, bile acid sequestrants may also bind drugs in the GI tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. For this reason, it is generally advised that bile acid sequestrants be spaced several hours apart from other drugs.

=== Vitamins ===
They can also bind fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. This effect could result in a vitamin deficiency, and so checking blood levels and possible supplementation has been suggested.

==Examples==
Three drugs are members of this class; all are synthetic polymeric resins:
* Cholestyramine (generic and various proprietary names)
* Colestipol (Colestid, Colestipid)
* Colesevelam (Cholestagel in Europe, Welchol in the US, Lodalis in Canada)
