<text>The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA), previously known as the Empire Parliamentary Association, is an organisation which works to support good governance, democracy and human rights. 

In 1989 the patron of the CPA was the Head of the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth II. The vice-patronship rotates amongst Heads of State and of Government of the Commonwealth nations who host its forthcoming annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The Association&#x27;s supreme authority is the General Assembly, constituted by delegates to the annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The business and activities of the CPA are managed by an Executive Committee, which reports to the General Assembly. The CPA&#x27;s funds are derived from membership fees paid by its branches, as well as from two trust funds and benefactors.

The official publication of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is &quot;The Parliamentarian&quot;, the Journal of Commonwealth Parliaments which was first published in January 1920. The organisation administers the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP), a network across the Commonwealth which promotes greater representation for women in Parliament; the CPA Small Branches network, representing parliaments and legislatures with populations below 500,000 people; the Commonwealth Parliamentarians with Disabilities (CPwD) network; and the Commonwealth Youth Parliament, an annual gathering of young people hosted by a Commonwealth Parliament.

The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) currently has approximately 180 branches and is divided into nine regions: Africa, Asia, Australia, British Islands and Mediterranean, Canada, Caribbean, Americas and Atlantic, India, Pacific, and South-East Asia. The CPA Headquarters Secretariat is based in London.

The CPA was founded as the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1911, with its first branches being Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the latter branch administering the Association as a whole. In 1948 the Association changed its name to the current Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and invited all branches to participate in the organisation&#x27;s administration.

<doc id="707799" wikidata="Q7789657" url="?curid=707799" title="Thomas Fleming (judge)">
<text>Sir Thomas Fleming (April 15447 August 1613) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1581 and 1611. He was judge in the trial of Guy Fawkes following the Gunpowder Plot. He held several important offices, including Lord Chief Justice, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Solicitor General for England and Wales.

==Early life==
Fleming was the son of John Fleming, a general trader and mercer of Newport on the Isle of Wight, and his wife Dorothy Harris. The family lived in a house just to the east of the entrance to the corn market from the High Street in Newport. The Fleming family line had strong historical connections to the Isle of Wight, with several mentions of the name cropping up in previous historical documents and books. He went to school in Godshill and studied law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn where he was called to the bar in 1574.

==Career==
In 1581, Fleming was elected Member of Parliament for Kingston upon Hull after the existing members were dismissed as idle and impotent. He was elected MP for Winchester in 1584, and was re-elected in 1593. His progression within the legal profession was fast (possibly due to several personal connections with the monarch); he became a serjeant-at-law in 1594, and shortly afterwards became Recorder of London.

===Solicitor General===
In 1595, on the personal intervention of Elizabeth I, Fleming (in preference to Francis Bacon) was promoted to the position of Solicitor General, succeeding Sir Edward Coke who had become Attorney General. Historians regard the Queen&#x27;s decision as a pointed reminder to her courtiers, most of whom had lobbied hard for Bacon, that she had the ultimate power of patronage. Fleming was praised by his contemporaries, more particularly Coke, for his &quot;great judgments, integrity and discretion&quot;.

In 1597, Fleming was elected MP for Hampshire. He purchased the North Stoneham estate in 1599 from the young Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton who inherited the title and estate at the age of eight. He was elected MP for Southampton in 1601, but his maiden speech on 20 November of that year was a disaster and Fleming broke down; he never addressed the House of Commons again. When James I became King in 1603, Fleming was reappointed Solicitor General and was knighted on 23 July 1603. He was re-elected MP for Southampton for another term in 1604.

===Lord Chief Baron===
He was elevated to the bench as Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1604. It was in this capacity that he tried Guy Fawkes, having been one of the members of parliament at the time of the Gunpowder Plot. His conduct during the trial was criticised as he was accused of attempting &quot;to look wise, and say nothing&quot;.

Another notable case during his tenure as Chief Baron was &quot;Bates&#x27;s Case&quot;, also called The Case of Impositions, of 1606, on the power of the Crown to levy taxes without Parliamentary approval. John Bates, a merchant trading with Turkey, had refused to pay the unpopular tax on the import of currants. Fleming, in giving judgement for the Crown, held in effect that the King had an unlimited power to levy taxes in any way he thought fit: &quot;the power of the King is both ordinary and absolute... absolute power, existing for the nation&#x27;s safety, varies with the royal wisdom&quot;. The judgement was controversial and was even said to have contributed to the tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the next reign. Fleming, a merchant&#x27;s son, also displayed a somewhat cynical attitude to the business community, dismissing appeals to the common good with the scathing remark that &quot;the end of every private merchant is not the common good but his particular profit&quot;.

===Lord Chief Justice===

In 1607, on the death of Sir John Popham, Fleming was elevated to the post of Lord Chief Justice of England. The following year he obtained a Charter for Incorporation for Newport from the King, providing for the election of a Mayor instead of the historical appointed Bailiff. He assisted in the establishment of a free grammar school in the town. Also in 1608, Fleming was one of the judges at the trial of the &quot;post nati&quot; in 1608, siding with the majority of the judges in declaring that persons born in Scotland after the accession of James I were entitled to the privileges of natural-born subjects in England. The convocation of Oxford University granted him the award of MA on 7 August 1613, which was the day he died.

==Death==

Fleming died suddenly on 7 August 1613 at Stoneham Park in Hampshire, having given to his servants and farm labourers what was known in Hampshire as a &quot;hearing day.&quot; After joining in the festivities, he went to bed, apparently in sound health, but was taken suddenly ill, and died before morning. He was buried in St Nicolas Church, North Stoneham, where a stately monument records the numerous successes of his career. Known locally as the &quot;Floating Flemings&quot;, it is ornamented with recumbent whole length figures of Fleming in his robes, with his official insignia, and his wife, with ruff and hood, and the singular waist favoured by ladies of the Tudor era. Underneath is the following inscription:

==Family==

Fleming married on 13 February 1570 to his cousin, Mary James, the daughter of Dr Mark James, who was a personal physician of Queen Elizabeth I. They were married at St Thomas&#x27; Church, Newport, and lived at Carisbrooke Priory, the lease of which he purchased from the Secretary of State, Francis Walsingham. They had fifteen children of whom six sons and two daughters survived after Fleming&#x27;s death. His sons Thomas and Philip were both members of parliament. His son Francis was Master of the Horse to Oliver Cromwell. Other sons were Walter, John, James and William. His daughters were Elizabeth, Mary, Jane, Eleanor, Dowsabell, Mary and another of name unknown. There was another child of name and gender unknown. Elizabeth married Robert Meverel and their daughter, also Elizabeth, married Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Ardglass.

Fleming&#x27;s descendants were still in possession of the Stoneham Park estate in 1908. The Fleming Arms public house and Fleming Road, both in Swaythling, are named after the family. There is another public house of the same name in Binstead, Isle of Wight.

<text>Snatch is a 2000 crime comedy film written and directed by Guy Ritchie, featuring an ensemble cast and set in the London criminal underworld. The film contains two intertwined plots, one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster (Alan Ford) who is ready and willing to have his subordinates carry out severe and sadistic acts of violence.

The film shares themes, ideas, and motifs with Ritchie&#x27;s first film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors.

==Plot==
A gang of robbers disguised as Orthodox Jews steal an diamond during a heist in Antwerp. Franky Four-Fingers, the gang&#x27;s leader, goes to London to see diamond dealer Doug the Head on behalf of Jewish-American organized crime figure Cousin Avi to fence the stolen diamonds. Franky is told to visit arms dealer and ex-KGB agent Boris the Blade in London by one of the robbers, who tells Boris, his brother, to steal the diamond from Franky.

Unlicensed boxing promoter and slot machine shop owner Turkish is forced to enter his boxer Gorgeous George in a match against one of crime boss Brick Top&#x27;s boxers. When Turkish sends his partner Tommy with George to purchase a caravan from a group of Irish Travellers, George is knocked out by bare-knuckle boxing champion Mickey O&#x27;Neil with a single punch. Mickey agrees to replace the injured George in the upcoming match in exchange for a new caravan for his mother, and Brick Top demands that Mickey throw the fight.

Boris arranges for pawnbrokers Vinny and Sol to rob Franky at Brick Top&#x27;s bookies, while Avi, knowing Franky is a gambling addict, flies to London with his bodyguard Rosebud to pick up the diamond personally. At the bookies, Sol, Vinny, and their getaway driver Tyrone are caught on camera and find no money, since Gorgeous George&#x27;s cancellation means that all bets are off. They manage to kidnap Franky, handcuffed to the briefcase containing the diamond, but he is killed by Boris after Vinny accidentally uses Boris&#x27;s name within earshot. Hacking off Franky&#x27;s arm, Boris leaves with the diamond.

At the match, Mickey again knocks his opponent out with a single punch, prompting Brick Top to seize Turkish&#x27;s savings and demand that Mickey lose another fight. When Mickey refuses, Brick Top&#x27;s men trash Turkish&#x27;s arcade and burn down Mickey&#x27;s mother&#x27;s caravan, killing her. Brick Top tracks down Tyrone, Vinny, and Sol, who bargain for their lives by offering to retrieve the diamond. Avi and Doug hire bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony to find Franky and they capture Boris and the diamond, pursued by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone, with Turkish and Tommy driving on the same road. Tommy inadvertently causes Tony to crash, killing Rosebud, and Boris escapes only to be hit by Tyrone&#x27;s car. 

Confronted by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone at a pub, Tony scares them off after noticing their guns are harmless replicas. A heavily armed Boris arrives and is killed by Tony, while Sol and Vinny escape with the diamond. Tony catches up to them, and they lie that the diamond is at their pawn shop, where Vinny accuses his dog, which he was given earlier by the Travellers, of eating it. When Avi tells Tony to kill the dog, Vinny produces the diamond, which the dog snatches and runs off back to the Travellers&#x27; campsite. Avi fires wildly at the fleeing dog, accidentally killing Tony, and returns to New York City emptyhanded.

Mickey agrees to fight to avoid further carnage, but gets so drunk at his mother&#x27;s wake that Turkish fears he will ruin the fixed match. Brick Top sends his men to the Travellers&#x27; camp, prepared to kill them all if Mickey fails. Making it to the fourth round per Brick Top&#x27;s plan, Mickey is knocked down, but recovers at the last moment and once again knocks out his opponent with one punch. Before they can kill Tommy, Turkish, and Mickey, Brick Top and his men are ambushed and massacred by the Travellers. This was all planned by Mickey, avenging his mother while making huge winnings by secretly betting on himself.

The next morning, Turkish and Tommy return to the Travellers&#x27; campsite to recruit Mickey to fight for them legitimately, but find it deserted and are confronted by the police. Vinny&#x27;s dog appears then and they claim to be simply out walking it, and the police allow them to leave. They cross paths with Sol and Vinny, who are arrested with Franky&#x27;s body in the boot of their car. Taking the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy it swallowed, Turkish and Tommy discover the diamond and consult Doug; he calls Avi, who returns to London to purchase it.

==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;Snatch&quot; was filmed between 18 October and 12 December 1999, in London and Buckinghamshire. A half-hour documentary of the production of the film was released featuring much of the cast along with Ritchie. Tom Delmar worked as the stunts choreographer for &quot;Snatch&quot;, and he has also choreographed stunt sequences in films such as &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; and &quot;Velayudham&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Snatch&quot; was largely successful, both in critical response and financial gross, and has gone on to develop a devoted cult following. It opened in the UK on 1 September 2000 in 389 cinemas and grossed £2,637,364 in its opening weekend to become the number one film at the box office. Including preview grosses of £542,638, its opening weekend gross of £3.1 million set the record for an 18-certificate film, beating the record set earlier in the year by &quot;American Beauty&quot;. From a budget of $10 million, the film grossed £12,137,698 in the United Kingdom, $30.3 million in the United States and Canada, and a total of $83.6 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74%, based on 142 reviews, with a weighted average score of 6.40/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though perhaps a case of style over substance, Guy Ritchie&#x27;s second crime caper is full of snappy dialogue, dark comedy, and interesting characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

While the film received mostly positive reviews, several reviewers commented negatively on perceived similarities in plot, character, setting, theme and style between &quot;Snatch&quot; and Ritchie&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. In his review, Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, writing that while ostensibly rooted in the London underworld, Pitt&#x27;s Irish Traveller community were the most interesting element of the plot and the film&#x27;s clearest predecessors were all American: &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comics, Damon Runyon stories, and zany Marx Brothers comedies. He raised the question of &quot;What am I to say of &quot;Snatch&quot;, Ritchie&#x27;s new film, which follows the &#x27;Lock, Stock&#x27; formula so slavishly it could be like a new arrangement of the same song?&quot; 

Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; Elvis Mitchell commented that &quot;Mr. Ritchie seems to be stepping backward when he should be moving ahead&quot;. Some critics also argued that the film was lacking in depth and substance; many reviewers appeared to agree with Ebert&#x27;s comment that &quot;the movie is not boring, but it doesn&#x27;t build and it doesn&#x27;t arrive anywhere&quot;.

The film has gone on to develop a cult movie following, and has ranked in IMDb&#x27;s top 250 rated films.

Two versions of the soundtrack album were released, one on the Universal International label with 23 tracks.

==Home media==
The film has been released in multiple incarnations on DVD and other formats.

In July 2001, a two-disc special edition was released, containing both a full-screen and widescreen presentation of the feature. Included was an audio commentary track with director Guy Ritchie and producer Matthew Vaughn. The special features on the second disc included a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, original theatrical trailer and TV spots, text/photo galleries, storyboard comparisons, and filmographies.

In September 2002, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released a &quot;deluxe collection&quot; DVD as part of the company&#x27;s Superbit series. This release contained two discs, one being the special features disc of the original DVD release, and the other a superbit version of the feature. As is the case with superbit presentations, the disc was absent of the additional features included in the original standard DVD, such as the audio commentary. The disc contained subtitles in eight different languages, including a &quot;pikey&quot; track, which only showed subtitles for the character Mickey.

In June 2003, a single disc setup was released, with new cover art, containing the feature disc of the special edition set. This version was simply a repackaging, omitting the second disc.

In July 2021, Sony Pictures released Snatch on the 4k Ultra HD format, which features an HDR transfer of the film along with the special features of the previously released Blu-Ray.

==Television==
In April 2016, it was announced that a television series based on &quot;Snatch&quot; was in development, with the associated studios comparing the series to how the &quot;Fargo&quot; show expanded upon the original film. Created by writer, executive producer, and showrunner Alex De Rakoff, the series is based on a true story heist for gold bullion in London, the show will be a Crackle exclusive release. In August 2016, Rupert Grint was named among the cast of the series, while serving as an executive producer. Dougray Scott, Ed Westwick, Luke Pasqualino, Lucien Laviscount, Phoebe Dynevor, and Juliet Aubrey feature in recurring roles. 

The series had 20 episodes, running one hour-long each, and was named the most-viewed series for the streamer. The project was announced as a joint-venture production between Sony Pictures Television, Little Island Productions, and Sony Crackle Originals. The series debuted on 16 March 2017 and ran for two seasons.

<doc id="707814" wikidata="Q1900258" url="?curid=707814" title="Mark Mathabane">
<text>Mark Mathabane (born Johannes Mathabane, 18 October 1960) is a South African author, lecturer, and a former collegiate tennis player and college professor.

== Early life in South Africa ==
Mathabane was born in Alexandra, South Africa, an area that is a part of Johannesburg, the capital of the province of Gauteng. He was born to a life of poverty in the apartheid political setting of South Africa. His father was Jackson Mathabane, a Venda labourer who had an income of $10 a month. Mathabane has also stated that his father struggled with alcohol and gambling, and was even abusive. Magdalene Mathabane was Mathabane&#x27;s mother. She had been sold to Jackson Mathabane as a wife at the age of fifteen by her mother. Jackson and Magdalene Mathabane had seven children, of whom Mark Mathabane was the eldest.

=== Life in the ghetto ===
Mathabane and his family lived in a one-square-mile ghetto which was also home to more than 200,000 other individuals. These living conditions lacked the modern commodities of paved roads, electricity, and even sewer systems. Food was scarce in this ghetto, and the homes were nothing more than rough shacks. Mathabane never even had his first pair of shoes until he was fourteen years old. Mathabane&#x27;s early life in apartheid South Africa was devastating. He has stated that &quot;living in apartheid was like living in Hell.&quot; At the young age of six, Mathabane joined his first gang. Mathabane has stated that this lifestyle was horrific but that he did learn to cope in this environment. However, he has stated that it was the elements of this environment which suppressed his spirit with which he was not able to cope. This suppression of his spirit even drove Mathabane to the brink of suicide at the age of ten.

=== Mathabane&#x27;s mother ===
Mathabane has credited his illiterate mother with encouraging him to excel in education and to escape the confinements of apartheid South Africa. He has repeatedly mentioned her ability to always display love and encouragement even in her troublesome lifestyle.
Mathabane&#x27;s mother took a job to send him to school when he was seven. Many problems ensued from this endeavour since his father did not support the idea of obtaining an education.

=== First steps to escape from apartheid ===
Mathabane&#x27;s grandmother worked as a gardener, and he attributes some of the first steps in his eventual escape from apartheid South Africa to an instance when he went to work with his grandmother. The family that his grandmother worked for gave him his first English book, which was &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. From this book, Mathabane began to dream of escaping the apartheid lifestyle. Additionally, the family gave him his first tennis racket, which he used to train himself tennis. Tennis would later become a key element in his eventual escape from apartheid South Africa.

=== Change of name ===
Mathabane randomly began to identify as Mark instead of Johannes when he first began playing tennis at Ellis Park and was introduced to his first white friend.

== Life in America ==
=== Tennis and move to America ===

1972 Wimbledon tennis star Stan Smith and his wife, Marjory Gengler, were a key element in helping Mathabane obtain a tennis scholarship to the United States. Mathabane met Smith in 1977 at the South African Championship tennis tournament in Johannesburg. In 1978, with the aid of Smith, Mathabane moved to the United States and started attending Limestone College in South Carolina.

* [Abe &#x27;Scara&#x27; Thomas] - Was like a father to Mark. He introduced him to tennis, gave him his first tennis racquet and mentored/coached him until he got the scholarship to the USA. He introduced Mark to different people who were prominent in the tennis circle. My dad is the &quot;freckled faced colored man&quot; referred to in the book. Abe Thomas loved Marvel comic books and collected them.

=== College life ===
Mathabane was faced with a whole new world in America. Even though he had escaped apartheid from South Africa, racial discrimination and prejudice still existed in America. Mathabane attended Limestone College in 1978 and then moved to Saint Louis University in 1979. Following that, Mathabane attended Quincy College in 1981 and then moved to Dowling College.

While attending Dowling College Mathabane became the first Black editor of the school magazine. He graduated Dowling College cum laude with a degree in Economics in 1983.
Mathabane also pursued graduate level studies at Poynter Institute and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.

Later on in his life, Mathabane received an honorary doctorate from Wittenberg University.

=== Early success ===
Mathabane wrote his autobiography, &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot;, in 1986. &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; illustrated his prior life in apartheid South Africa, and became a national best-seller. After reading &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot;, Oprah Winfrey invited Mathabane to appear on her show. Mathabane went on to write several other literary works (see #Literary works).

=== Recent life ===
Mathabane had his first visit to the White House in 1993 after being invited by President Bill Clinton, who had read &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot;. From 1992–1993, Mathabane served as a White House Fellow under US President Bill Clinton, and assisted him with his educational policies. Mathabane has written articles for some print sources. He has also been a guest on several different TV and radio shows, and is also a well-known speaker. Mathabane and his wife, Gail (née Ernsberger), their three children (Bianca, b. 1989, Nathan b. 1991 and Stanley b. 1994), and his extended family lived in North Carolina. They relocated to Portland, Oregon in 2004, where he was formerly director of multicultural education at Catlin Gabel School.

== Magdalene Scholarship Fund ==
In 2000, Mathabane established a non-profit organisation which he named after his mother Magdalene. As stated on Mathabane&#x27;s website, the fund&#x27;s mission is to &quot;create hope in an impoverished, bleak part of the world by providing scholarships, books, uniforms and school supplies for needy children attending Bovet Primary School in Alexandra Township, South Africa.&quot;

== Literary works ==
=== &quot;Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth&#x27;s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa&quot; ===

Mathabane&#x27;s first book was &quot;Kaffir Boy: the True Story of a Black Youth&#x27;s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa&quot;, which was published in 1986, is an autobiography of his early life in apartheid South Africa. This book was listed as number one on the Washington Post&#x27;s best-sellers list, and as number three on the New York Times best-seller list. &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; has also won a Christopher Award, has been translated into several different languages, and is also used in many American classrooms.

=== &quot;Kaffir Boy in America: An Encounter with Apartheid&quot; ===
Mathabane&#x27;s second book &quot;Kaffir Boy in America: An Encounter with Apartheid&quot; was also his second autobiography, and was published in 1989. &quot;Kaffir Boy in America&quot; picked up where &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; had left off and followed Mathabane&#x27;s early life in America.

=== &quot;Love in Black and White: The Triumph of Love over Prejudice and Taboo&quot; ===
In 1992, Mathabane coauthored his third book, &quot;Love in Black and White: The Triumph of Love over Prejudice and Taboo&quot;, with his wife Gail. &quot;Love in Black and White&quot; examined Mark and Gail&#x27;s interracial relationship, and the obstacles that they faced.

=== &quot;African Women: Three Generations&quot; ===
&quot;African Women: Three Generations&quot; was Mathabane&#x27;s fourth book, published in 1994. &quot;African Women&quot; tells the true story of the struggles of Mathabane&#x27;s grandmother, mother, and sister in South Africa.

=== &quot;Ubuntu&quot; ===
In 1999, Mathabane wrote his first novel &quot;Ubuntu&quot;. &quot;Ubuntu&quot; is a fictional thriller of a human rights lawyer in post-apartheid South Africa.

=== &quot;Miriam&#x27;s Song&quot; ===

<doc id="707815" wikidata="Q169963" url="?curid=707815" title="Jason Statham">
<text>Jason Statham ( ; born 26 July 1967) is an English actor and producer. He is known for portraying tough, gritty, or violent characters in various action thriller films, and has been credited for leading the resurgence of action films during the 2000s and 2010s. By 2017, his films had grossed over £1.1 billion ($1.5 billion), making him one of the industry&#x27;s most bankable stars.

Statham began practising Chinese martial arts, kickboxing, and karate recreationally in his youth while working at local market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was a member of Britain&#x27;s national diving team and competed for England in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi&#x27;s in various advertising campaigns.

Statham&#x27;s history of working at market stalls inspired his casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998) and &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000). Both films were commercial hits, and they helped catapult Statham to stardom. He went on to play supporting roles in the American action films &quot;Turn It Up&quot; (2000), &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; and &quot;The One&quot; (both 2001). From 2002 to 2008, he played the title role in the first three films in the &quot;Transporter&quot; film series (2002–2008), which solidified his status as an action star. In 2003, he appeared in the ensemble heist action film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. He went on to play leading roles in the commercially successful films &quot;Crank&quot; (2006), &quot;The Bank Job&quot; (2008), &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (2011), &quot;Homefront&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2016), &quot;The Meg&quot; (2018), &quot;Wrath of Man&quot; (2021), &quot;Meg 2: The Trench&quot; (2023), and &quot;The Beekeeper&quot; (2024).

Statham has also starred as Lee Christmas in the ensemble action film series &quot;The Expendables&quot; (2010–2023) and as Deckard Shaw in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise (2013–2023), including the spin-off &quot;Hobbs &amp; Shaw&quot; (2019), which he co-produced. His voice acting work includes the documentaries &quot;Thai Boxing: A Fighting Chance&quot; (2002), &quot;Truth in 24&quot; (2008) and its 2012 sequel, and the animated film &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Jason Statham was born in Shirebrook on 26 July 1967, the son of dancer Eileen (née Yates) and street seller Barry Statham. His father also worked odd jobs as a house painter, coal miner, and singer in the Canary Islands. Statham moved to Great Yarmouth, where he initially chose not to follow his father&#x27;s career working the local market stalls, instead practising martial arts. He grew up alongside football player Vinnie Jones, with whom he would later act; Jones introduced him to football, and Statham went on to play for the local grammar school, which he attended from 1978 to 1983. He was also passionate about diving, practising daily to perfect his techniques. He was a member of Britain&#x27;s National Swimming Squad for 12 years, and competed for England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in the 10 metre, 3 metre, and 1 metre events. He said in a 2003 interview that his time with the national squad was a &quot;great experience&quot; that taught him &quot;discipline, focus, and certainly [kept him] out of trouble&quot;.

Statham was spotted by the sports modelling agency Sports Promotions while training at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. He was signed by Tommy Hilfiger, Griffin, and Levi&#x27;s for various modelling contracts during their 1996 spring and summer collections. In 1997, he became a model for the clothing brand French Connection. A spokesperson for the high street clothing chain said, &quot;We chose Jason because we wanted our model to look like a normal guy. His look is just right for now: very masculine and not too male-modelly.&quot; However, he was still forced to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a street seller to make ends meet, stating that he sold &quot;fake perfume and jewellery on street corners&quot;. He made small appearances in a few music videos, including &quot;Comin&#x27; On&quot; by The Shamen in 1993, &quot;Run to the Sun&quot; by Erasure in 1994, and &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; by The Beautiful South in 1995.

==Career==
===2000–2010: Rise to prominence===

While working as a model for French Connection, Statham was introduced to fledgling filmmaker Guy Ritchie, who was developing a film and needed to fill the role of a streetwise con artist. After learning about Statham&#x27;s past as a market stall salesman, Ritchie cast him in the crime comedy thriller &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998). The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped put Statham in the public eye; for his role, he was paid £5,000. Statham&#x27;s second collaboration with Ritchie came with &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), which earned more than $80 million at the box office. For his role in &quot;Snatch&quot;, he was paid £15,000. He was then able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two films in 2001: the science fiction action horror film &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; and the science fiction martial arts action film &quot;The One&quot;.

In 2002, he narrated the martial arts documentary &quot;Thai Boxing: A Fighting Chance&quot; (2002), which follows the lives of three individuals who come from very different backgrounds that are all training Muay Thai, each with their own unique motivations and stories, as they prepare for their next fight.

Statham was offered more film roles and was cast in the lead role of driver Frank Martin in the action film &quot;The Transporter&quot; (2002), written by Luc Besson. The film spawned two sequels, &quot;Transporter 2&quot; (2005) and &quot;Transporter 3&quot; (2008). He also played supporting roles in &quot;Mean Machine&quot; (2002), &quot;The Italian Job&quot; (2003), and as the lead villain in &quot;Cellular&quot; (2004).

In 2005, Statham was once again cast by Ritchie to star in his new project, &quot;Revolver&quot;, which was a critical and box office failure. He played a dramatic role in the independent film &quot;London&quot; in 2006. That same year he played the lead role in the action film &quot;Crank&quot;. Statham was asked to promote &quot;Crank&quot; during the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con Convention. In 2008, Statham starred in the British crime thriller &quot;The Bank Job&quot; and &quot;Death Race&quot;, a remake of &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (1975). American film critic Armond White hailed Statham&#x27;s ascension as an action film star. On the occasion of &quot;Death Race&quot;, White championed Statham&#x27;s &quot;best track record of any contemporary movie star.&quot; Later in 2008, White praised Statham&#x27;s &quot;Transporter 3&quot; as a great example of kinetic pop art. Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire Magazine&quot;, noted the film as &quot;a dour, drab affair&quot;, but credited the film with &quot;establishing Statham as a new action hero, as at ease with gruff one-liners as he was with Jackie Chan-esque high-kicking&quot;.

In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples. Statham stated &quot;We&#x27;ve got a movie we&#x27;re trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;. It&#x27;s not a remake or anything, but it&#x27;s a little bit like that, about relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have. The working title is &quot;The Grabbers&quot;.&quot; He reprised his role as Chev Chelios in the 2009 sequel &quot;.&quot;

In 2010, Statham appeared alongside fellow action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Mickey Rourke, among others, in the ensemble action film &quot;The Expendables&quot;. Statham plays Lee Christmas, a former SAS soldier and expert at close quarters combat using knives. The film was commercially successful, opening at number one at the box office in the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India, and grossed a total of $274 million worldwide.

===2011–2015: Commercial expansion===

In his first film of 2011, Statham starred in the remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film &quot;The Mechanic&quot; as Arthur Bishop. A theatrical trailer depicting Statham&#x27;s character &quot;shooting a man&#x27;s head off&quot; was banned from circulation by the Advertising Standards Authority for showing excessive violence. His role in &quot;The Mechanic&quot; was positively reviewed by the critics both in the United States and the United Kingdom. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised his performance as possessing a &quot;now-customary efficiency&quot; in attaining &quot;an entertaining hitman thriller&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted Statham as &quot;sleek as a bullet&quot;; and the film &quot;a more powerful recharge&quot; of the original. UK newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; hailed Statham as &quot;England&#x27;s best export to action movies in just about forever, a businesslike brute with gentlemanly soul.&quot; He returned to British film by starring in the police drama &quot;Blitz&quot; as Detective Sergeant Tom Brant. The film received mixed reviews with Cath Clake of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewing it as &quot;not half bad&quot; and &quot;oddly entertaining&quot;. He was then cast in the action film &quot;Killer Elite&quot;. The film was based on real events, which were the subject of Sir Ranulph Fiennes&#x27; novel &quot;The Feather Men&quot;. Statham played an assassin named Danny who comes out of retirement to save an old friend, played by Robert De Niro. The film grossed returned a negative budget, and was panned by the critics.

In August 2011, he began filming &quot;Parker&quot; for director Taylor Hackford; the film was released in January 2013. Statham played Parker, the criminal antihero previously played by Mel Gibson in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Payback&quot; and by Lee Marvin in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot; (though their characters were given different surnames). A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the actor in the film: &quot;[Statham], who seems to be made entirely of muscle and scar tissue, is comfortable with his limitations as an actor. His Parker, in any case, is more of an axiom than a fully rounded human being.&quot; A 2012 BBC News report estimated that his ten-year film career to date (2002 to 2012) yielded over one billion dollars in the box office, making him one of the industry&#x27;s most bankable stars. He was signed on to reprise his role as Lee Christmas in &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; in 2012.
In 2013, Statham had a cameo appearance at the end of &quot;Fast &amp; Furious 6&quot; as the brother of the film&#x27;s antagonist Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He reprised the character, this time as the main antagonist, in &quot;Furious 7&quot;, which was released in April 2015. He also starred opposite James Franco in the thriller &quot;Homefront&quot;, written by Sylvester Stallone, and headlined the British thriller &quot;Hummingbird&quot;. The latter film was praised by critics for pushing Statham&#x27;s acting abilities to new heights. His &quot;attempt to develop his &#x27;brand&#x27; by trying more adventurous parts&quot; noted by &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Mark Kermode, &quot;[broadened] his dramatic palette&quot;. Statham made a cameo in the 2014 music video &quot;Summer&quot; of Calvin Harris as one of the car racers. In 2014, he returned as Lee Christmas in &quot;The Expendables 3.&quot; Although critically panned, the film would go on to gross $215 million against a $90 million budget.

In 2015 he starred in the action comedy &quot;Spy&quot; alongside Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law, and Rose Byrne. The film, a commercial success, was particularly praised for showcasing Statham&#x27;s comedic side in contrast to his more serious roles. According to an article by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, a &quot;Spy 2&quot; was development in late 2015, with more screen time dedicated for Statham&#x27;s character, Rick Ford. He was nominated for the Critic&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Actor in a Comedy for his role in &quot;Spy&quot;.

Statham was offered a three-film contract to reboot the &quot;Transporter&quot; series in late 2015, but turned it down because he was not given the script before the signing date and unhappy with its compensation package. According to an article by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Statham expressed interest in playing James Bond in the upcoming &quot;Spectre&quot; film. Its author, Steve Rose noted that &quot;there was no doubt Statham can walk the Bond walk. And talking his talk can hardly be an issue with a character whose accent has fluctuated between Sean Connery&#x27;s Scottish brogue and Timothy Dalton&#x27;s Welsh.&quot; After the interview there were multiple calls from critics and the public to instate him as James Bond in a future film.

===2016–present: Continued success===
The sequel to his 2011 film &quot;The Mechanic&quot; was scheduled for production in late 2016 and announced to open as &quot;.&quot; The film went on to become highly commercially successfully in international film markets grossing $109.4 million worldwide. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, the film was Statham&#x27;s &quot;seventh-biggest earner&quot; and most commercially successful solo film venture of his career.

In February 2017, he starred alongside Gal Gadot in a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement for Wix.com during Super Bowl LI. CNET reported that the advertisement reached 22 million user impressions. Statham was asked to re-join the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise once more in 2016. The ensuing film, &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot;, was released in April 2017 to commercial success. While the film overall received mixed reviews, Statham was praised for his comedic timing and onscreen chemistry with contemporaries. The film went on to be the third highest-grossing film of 2017 and the 12th highest-grossing film of all time.

&quot;Spy 2&quot; was confirmed on 15 February 2018. But later in 2018, Feig explained that although a sequel to &quot;Spy&quot; could still happen, &quot;there hasn&#x27;t been any interest from the studio&quot; in the project.

Statham played the lead, former Naval captain Jonas Taylor, in the 2018 action-horror film &quot;The Meg&quot;, which was released on 10 August. The film would go on to gross $527.8 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing U.S.-Chinese co-production of all time.

In 2019, Statham reprised his role as Deckard Shaw again in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise focusing on his and Dwayne Johnson&#x27;s characters. The film grossed $758 million worldwide, becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of 2019, and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for Statham&#x27;s performance.

In 2022, Statham established his own production company, Punch Palace Productions.

An article by Adam Gabbatt in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Statham&#x27;s character contributions to his industry and film niche are &quot;tough [and] uncompromising&quot;. Some critics note his presence as a &quot;defining feature&quot; that signals to movie-goers the content of a film. The same exposé commented, &quot;You know what you&#x27;re getting with a Jason Statham film. He will beat people up. He will crash cars. He will do an unconvincing American accent.&quot;
Statham&#x27;s impact on the action-thriller genre has been seen by Gabbatt as a replacement of the same undertaken by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme during their runs as headliners throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Statham himself cites Stallone, Bruce Lee, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, and Clint Eastwood as his inspirations.

An article by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; reported that Manchester University Press commissioned an academic study analysing the impact Statham has had on the British and American film industries from his debut in 1998 to 2018. According to the article, professors Steven Gerrard and Robert Shail are looking to show &quot;the changing face of British cinematic masculinity&quot; into &quot;one that embraces cinema across a wide range of projects, but one that also uses cross-textual media in his output&quot;.

==In popular media==
In 2003, Statham appeared in three British television commercials for the Kit Kat chocolate bar. Described as a &quot;break philosopher&quot;, he philosophised about salmon swimming upstream, a Mexican fisherman, and the relative speeds and ages of animals, before ending with a reminder that &quot;taking a break&quot; (alluding to the Kit Kat slogan) is an important part of life.

In the comic book series &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, that series&#x27; version of the villain Vulture was rendered by artist Mark Bagley to resemble actor Statham, per writer Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; instructions.

In the Twenty One Pilots song &quot;Pet Cheetah&quot; released in 2018, Statham is mentioned in the lyrics.

==Personal life==
Statham has been in a relationship with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley since 2010. The couple announced their engagement in January 2016. Their son was born in June 2017. Their daughter was born on 2 February 2022. They lived in California for a number of years before moving back to London in 2020.

Statham holds a black belt in karate.

Statham enjoys wakeboarding, jet skiing, wind surfing, and rock climbing. He is known for performing many of his own stunts. While filming on location in Bulgaria for &quot;The Expendables 3&quot;, he drove a truck off the road in Varna and crashed into the Black Sea due to malfunctioning brakes.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Statham advocated for stunt performers to be given their own category at the Academy Awards: &quot;All of the stunt men, these are the unsung heroes. They really are. Nobody is giving them any credibility. They&#x27;re risking their necks. And then you&#x27;ve got poncy actors pretending like they&#x27;re doing [the stunts].&quot;

In 2014, Statham was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

<doc id="707820" wikidata="Q5311965" url="?curid=707820" title="Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby">
<text>Dudley Ryder, 2nd Earl of Harrowby (19 May 179819 November 1882), styled Viscount Sandon between 1809 and 1847, was a British politician. He held office under Lord Palmerston as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1855 and as Lord Privy Seal between 1855 and 1858.

==Background and education==
Harrowby was born in London, the son of Dudley Ryder, 1st Earl of Harrowby and his wife Lady Susanna Leveson-Gower (1772 - 1838), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford.

He was an officer of the Staffordshire Yeomanry, being commissioned as a lieutenant in the Stafford Troop on 20 December 1819 and being promoted to captain on 26 March 1826. He resigned his commission in March 1831.

==Political career==
Harrowby was elected Member of Parliament for Tiverton in 1819, a seat he held until 1831 before switching to represent Liverpool until 1847. He served as a Lord of the Admiralty in 1827 and as Secretary to the Board of Control under Lord Grey between 1830 and 1831. He had a London home in Grosvenor Square. 

In 1847, he became Earl of Harrowby and took up a seat in the House of Lords. He remained out of office for a long time, but in 1855, eight years after he had succeeded his father as Earl of Harrowby, he was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster by Lord Palmerston, becoming a Privy Counsellor at the same time. In a few months he was transferred to the office of Lord Privy Seal, a position which he resigned in 1858.

He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1859. Harrowby was also three times President of the Royal Statistical Society (1840–1842, 1849–1851, 1855–1857), chairman of the Maynooth commission and a member of other important royal commissions. He was regarded as among the most stalwart and prominent defenders of the Church of England.

==Animal welfare==

Harrowby campaigned for animal welfare and was president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) from 1861. In 1864, he met Henry Bergh who had visited England and helped him with the formulation of ASPCA&#x27;s policies. Harrowby was President of the RSPCA until 1878; he was succeeded by Lord Aberdare. Unlike Abderdare, Harrowby was sympathetic to the cause of anti-vivisection.

Thomas Jackson&#x27;s animal welfare book &quot;Our Dumb Companions&quot; (1864) was dedicated to Harrowby.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Harrowby married Lady Frances Stuart, daughter of John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute, on 15 September 1823. They had two sons:

* Dudley Francis Stuart Ryder, 3rd Earl of Harrowby (16 January 1831 - 26 March 1900)
* Henry Dudley Ryder, 4th Earl of Harrowby (3 May 1836 - 11 December 1900)

==Death==
Lady Harrowby died in March 1859. Lord Harrowby remained a widower until his death at Sandon Hall on 19 November 1882, aged 84. He was succeeded in the earldom and other titles by his elder son, Dudley.

<doc id="707823" wikidata="Q962363" url="?curid=707823" title="Cry Freedom">
<text>Cry Freedom is a 1987 epic biographical drama film directed and produced by Richard Attenborough, set in late-1970s apartheid-era South Africa. The screenplay was written by John Briley based on a pair of books by journalist Donald Woods. The film centres on the real-life events involving South African activist Steve Biko and his friend Woods, who initially finds him too radical, and attempts to understand his way of life. Denzel Washington stars as Biko, while Kevin Kline portrays Woods. Penelope Wilton co-stars as Woods&#x27; wife Wendy. &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film&#x27;s production was made by Universal Pictures and Marble Arch Productions and the film was primarily shot on location in Zimbabwe due to not being allowed to film in South Africa at the time of production. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures, opening in the United States on 6 November 1987. South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko&#x27;s writings being banned at the time of its release.

The film was generally met with favourable reviews and earned theatrical rentals of $15 million worldwide. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor (for Washington), Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It was nominated for seven BAFTA Awards, including Best Film and Best Direction, and won Best Sound.

==Plot==
Following a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in East London in the south-east of the Cape Province in South Africa, liberal white South African journalist Donald Woods seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet the anti-Apartheid black activist Steve Biko, a leading member of the Black Consciousness Movement. Biko has been officially &quot;banned&quot; by the government and is not permitted to leave his defined &#x27;banning area&#x27; at King William&#x27;s Town. Woods is opposed to Biko&#x27;s banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the Government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko&#x27;s desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko&#x27;s point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.

After speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by the South African security forces (who have been tipped off by an informer). Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African Government, which is white minority-controlled. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalise the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a Government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with Jimmy Kruger (John Thaw), the South African Minister of Justice, in his house in Pretoria in an attempt to prevent further abuses. Minister Kruger first expresses discontent over their actions; however, Woods is later harassed at his home by security forces, who insinuate that their orders came directly from Kruger.

Later, Biko travels to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. &quot;&quot;, security forces stop his car and arrest him asking him to say his name, and he said &quot;Bantu Stephen Biko&quot;. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1 200 km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.

Woods then works to expose the police&#x27;s complicity in Biko&#x27;s death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko&#x27;s body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now &#x27;banned&#x27;, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police, including bullets fired into the family home, vandalism, and the delivery of t-shirts with Biko&#x27;s image that have been dusted with itching powder. He later decides to seek asylum in Britain in order to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of Lesotho, disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist Bruce Haigh, the British High Commission in Maseru, and the Government of Lesotho, they are flown under United Nations passports and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via Botswana, to London, where they were granted political asylum.

The film&#x27;s epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the Government whilst the song Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika is sung.

==Production==

===Development===

The premise of &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; is based on the true story of Steve Biko, the charismatic South African Black Consciousness Movement leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of apartheid, and Donald Woods, the liberal white editor of the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People&#x27;s Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student&#x27;s Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project, which supported black workers whose unions were not recognised under the apartheid regime. Biko&#x27;s political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African Government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being &#x27;banned&#x27; in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in the custody of the South African Police (the SAP). The circumstances leading to Biko&#x27;s death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance. As a result, the South African Government &#x27;banned&#x27; a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organisations, especially those closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa. After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life, Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African Government. Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled &quot;Biko&quot;, exposing police complicity in his death. That book, along with Woods&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Asking For Trouble&quot;, both being published in the United Kingdom, became the basis for the film.

===Filming===
Every exterior (outdoor) scene was filmed in Zimbabwe, as were roughly 70% of interior shots. The remaining interior shots were all filmed in England. Principal filming took place primarily in Harare in Zimbabwe because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting.

The film includes a dramatised depiction of the Soweto uprising which occurred on 16 June 1976. Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of black African schoolchildren during a protest march.

===Music===
The original motion picture soundtrack for &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; was released by MCA Records on 25 October 1990. It features songs composed by veteran musicians George Fenton, Jonas Gwangwa and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko&#x27;s funeral they sing the hymn &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;. Jonathan Bates edited the film&#x27;s music.

A live version of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Biko&quot; was released to promote the film; although the song was not on the film soundtrack, footage was used in its video.

The title song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to &quot;Two Hearts&quot; from &quot;Buster&quot;, performed by Phil Collins.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 74% of 27 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.5 out of 10. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Rita Kempley, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said actor Washington gave a &quot;zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa&#x27;s major political voices when he was only 25.&quot; Also writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe thought the film &quot;could have reached further&quot; and felt the story centring on Woods&#x27;s character was &quot;its major flaw&quot;. He saw director Attenborough&#x27;s aims as &quot;more academic and political than dramatic&quot;. Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, &quot;In a country busier than Chile with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods&#x27; slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing.&quot;

Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; offered a mixed review calling it a &quot;sincere and valuable movie&quot; while also exclaiming, &quot;Interesting things were happening, the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live.&quot; But on a negative front, he noted how the film &quot;promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor&#x27;s flight across the border. It&#x27;s sort of a liberal yuppie version of that Disney movie where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom.&quot;

Janet Maslin writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw the film as &quot;bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others&quot; but pointed out that &quot;it isn&#x27;t dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form.&quot; She also complimented the African scenery, noting that &quot;&quot;Cry Freedom&quot; can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor&#x27;s picturesque cinematography&quot;. The &quot;Variety Staff&quot; felt Washington did &quot;a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulte and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup.&quot; On Kline&#x27;s performance, they noticed how his &quot;low-key screen presence serves him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist.&quot; Film critic Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot; review calling it &quot;fresh&quot; and a &quot;solid adventure&quot; while commenting &quot;its images do remain in the mind ... I admire this film very much.&quot; He thought both Washington&#x27;s and Kline&#x27;s portrayals were &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;quite good&quot;. Similarly, Michael Price writing in the &quot;Fort Worth Press&quot; viewed &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; as often &quot;harrowing and naturalistic but ultimately self-important in its indictment of police-state politics.&quot;
Mark Salisbury of &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote of the lead acting to be &quot;excellent&quot; and the crowd scenes &quot;astonishing&quot;, while equally observing how the climax was &quot;truly nerve-wracking&quot;. He called it &quot;an implacable work of authority and compassion, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; is political cinema at its best.&quot; James Sanford, however, writing for the &quot;Kalamazoo Gazette&quot;, did not appreciate the film&#x27;s qualities, calling it &quot;a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story.&quot; Rating the film with &quot;3 Stars&quot;, critic Leonard Maltin wrote that the film was a &quot;sweeping and compassionate film&quot;. He did, however, note that the film &quot;loses momentum as it spends too much time on Kline and his family&#x27;s escape from South Africa&quot;. But in positive followup, he pointed out that it &quot;cannily injects flashbacks of Biko to steer it back on course.&quot;

John Simon of the &quot;National Review&quot; called &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; &quot;grandiosely inept&quot;.

In 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by David Sirota in &quot;Salon&quot; in an article concerning white saviour narratives in film.

<text>Markham Wildman (25 January 1936 – 18 November 2024) was a billiards and snooker player and cue sports commentator from Peterborough. He won the World Professional Billiards Championship in 1984 and was runner up in 1980 and 1982. He made the first televised snooker century break in 1960, while still an amateur.

A junior career saw him lift titles in both billiards and snooker, events played in the sport&#x27;s top venues in London. By defeating John Dunning in the final, he won the 1963 Working Men&#x27;s Club and Institute Union Championship, an event regarded as the second-most prestigious amateur title in the UK after the English Amateur Championship. In 1968, he won the English Amateur Billiards Championship with a 2,652–2,540 victory against Clive Everton. In 1977, Wildman was runner-up to Michael Ferreira in a World Open Billiards Championship held in Christchurch. He was accepted as a professional player by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) in 1979. His best run as a professional snooker player was reaching the semi-finals of the 1984 Lada Classic; in the rankings for the following year he attained his highest placing of 21st. 

He reached the final of the 1980 World Professional Billiards Championship, finishing as runner-up to Fred Davis with a scoreline of 2,064–3,037. The 1983 UK Professional Billiards Championship was his first major title win as a professional, secured when he defeated Davis 1,500–1,032 in the final. During the semi-final, against Rex Williams, he recorded a break of 495, his highest. He won the World Billiards Championship title in 1984, narrowly defeating Eddie Charlton 1,045–1,012 in the five-hour final.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Wildman was a snooker commentator for ITV until snooker was dropped by the channel in 1993. He retired from professional snooker in 1991 but continued to play professional billiards for several years. He served as a WPBSA director, including as chairman from September 1999 to 4 December 2001.

==Biography==
Markham Wildman was born on 25 January 1936. He attended Deacon&#x27;s School, Peterborough. Coached by his father Royce Wildman and by professional player John Barrie, he entered the 1950 British under-16 Billiards championship and lost 154–200 to Marcus Owen in the semi-finals. He won the championship the following year by defeating John Burgess 400–355 in the final.

He was the British under-19 winner in 1952 and 1953. He was also the 1952 British Boys Champion in snooker and British Junior snooker champion in 1954. In 1954 he entered the English Amateur Snooker Championship for the first time, but was eliminated 0–3 by Ron Gross. The next year he lost in the first round and in 1956 he was beaten again by Gross, this time 4–5 in the home counties area final. In 1960, he compiled the first televised snooker century break.

Over the next few years he failed to make an impact in the main English Amateur Snooker Championship; a 1963 profile in &quot;Billiards and Snooker&quot; magazine commended his ting and positional play but suggested that he could be &quot;erratic&quot; and impatient. That year, he won the Working Men&#x27;s Club and Institute Union Championship, regarded as the second-most prestigious amateur title in the UK after the English Amateur Championship, with a 318–268 aggregate points victory in a five- contest against John Dunning.

In 1968, he won the English Amateur Billiards Championship by defeating Clive Everton 2,652–2,540 in the final. At the World Amateur Billiards Championship the following year, he finished joint fifth of eleven participants. &quot;Billiards and Snooker&quot; magazine editor Everton wrote that Wildman &quot;produced some brilliant if unorthodox&quot; play, but &quot;lacked the consistency and a final degree of assurance&quot; on some shots.

In 1977, Wildman was runner-up to Michael Ferreira in a World Open Billiards Championship held in Christchurch. In the semi-final, Wildman had eliminated Barrie, who described his former student as &quot;a spasmodic, opportunist sort of player, very unpredictable but always dangerous.&quot; Wildman applied to become a professional player in 1979 and was initially rejected by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), before being accepted later that year.

==Professional billiards career==
He reached the final of the 1980 World Professional Billiards Championship by defeating Bernard Bennett, Rex Williams and Ray Edmonds, and was runner-up to Fred Davis with a scoreline of 2,064–3,037. In the 1982 World Billiards Championship, he was runner-up to Williams. 

The 1983 UK Professional Billiards Championship was his first major title win as a professional, secured when he defeated Davis 1,500–1,032 in the final. During the semi-final, against Williams, he recorded a break of 495, his highest.

He won the World Billiards Championship title in 1984, narrowly defeating Charlton 1,045–1,012 in the five-hour final. Wildman had eliminated Paddy Morgan 1,347–759 and Ian Williamson 1,501–859 to reach the final. Halfway through the match against Charlton, Wildman led 599–508. With eight minutes left to play, Charlton came to the table 87 behind, but after taking more than a minute to play a single shot during a break of 54, he ran out of time. It was the closest result in the final since William Cook defeated John Roberts Jr. by 15 points in 1871.

In 1985, the Blue Arrow Masters became the first Billiards tournament since the 1950s to be televised in the UK. Wildman was one of six contestants, along with Williams, Fred Davis, Charlton, Ray Reardon and Alex Higgins, in a competition played over games where each player&#x27;s time was limited to 15 minutes. Wildman was runner-up to Williams. His attempt to defend the world title in 1985 when the format switched to a best-of-five games of first-to-400 saw him beat Tony Jones and Peter Francisco both 3–0 before Edmonds defeated him 3–0 in the semi-finals. He again lost in the semi-finals in 1986, 1–3 to Robby Foldvari.

The UK Championship was not held from 1984 to 1986. Wildman was drawn to meet Graham Miles, who withdrew, then defeated Bob Close 3–1 before losing 3–0 to Edmonds in the semi-finals.

==Professional snooker career==
In his first match in a professional ranking tournament, he lost 7–9 to Frank Jonik in the qualifying competition for the 1980 World Snooker Championship. During the 1980-81 snooker season he won two matches at the 1980 UK Championship but was then eliminated by Fred Davis. He lost his first qualifying match for the 1981 World Snooker Championship 3–9 to Ray Edmonds. In 1981–82 he won two of five matches he played, but did not qualify for the main stage of any of the three tournaments he participated in.

In the following season, his reaching the last 16 of the 1982 Professional Players snooker tournament meant that he qualified for the 1983 Masters. Although his first four shots in his first-round match were all , he led Steve Davis 2–1 before losing 2–5. He qualified for the main competition of the 1983 World Snooker Championship where he lost 8–10 to Terry Griffiths, having led 8–7.

The 1983–84 season saw him defeat three top-16 players, John Virgo, Silvino Francisco and Charlton, to reach the semi-finals of the 1984 Lada Classic, where he was eliminated 3–5 by Tony Meo, It was the furthest he reached in a professional snooker tournament. He also qualified for the main stages of the 1983 International Open, the 1983 Professional Players Tournament and the 1983 UK Championship during the season. Although he lost against Roy Andrewartha in the of his first qualifying match for the 1984 World Snooker Championship, his performances over the preceding three seasons saw him ranked 21st, in the 1984–85 snooker world rankings, the highest placing he would attain during his career.

He did not reach as far as the quarter-finals of a major tournament again. Edmonds defeated him in qualifying for both the 1985 and 1986 world championships, and after defeating Foldvari in the second qualifying 1987 edition, he was beaten 0–10 by Jon Wright in the third qualifying round. Foldvari eliminated him in the qualifying competition for 1988, as did Francois Ellis in 1989 and Eddie Sinclair in 1990. In his final season as a snooker professional he lost to Derek Heaton in the first qualifying round for the 1991 Classic and then defeated Everton 5–3 in the 1991 British Open before losing to Bob Harris in the second qualifying round for that tournament.

==Non-playing career and death==
Following his national service in the Royal Air Force, Wildman worked in finance and was later an area manager for United Dominions Trust.

Wildman retired from professional snooker in 1991, but continued to play professional billiards for several years. Sports statistician Ian Morrison wrote in 1987 that inconsistency was Wildman&#x27;s main weakness as a player, perhaps due to his divided focus between his business career and cue sports. Wildman lacked confidence in his snooker abilities up to the early 1980s, but over time as he saw other players making mistakes in matches he was commentating on, he became more confident. &quot;The Observer&quot; journalist Janice Hale had described Wildman in 1985 as &quot;an absent minded figure who always seems to have forgotten something&quot;.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Wildman was a snooker commentator for ITV until snooker was dropped by the channel in 1993. During the 1990s and 2000s, he also commented for Screensport, Sky Sports and Eurosport.

He was a WPBSA director from 1984 to 1991, and for another term ending in 1997. From September 1999 to 4 December 2001 he served as WPBSA chairman, then had a further term on the board from 17 December 2001 until September 2002. He was appointed chairman of the WPBSA&#x27;s Billiards Committee when it was inaugurated and he successfully obtained sponsorship for tournaments internationally. The snooker historian Everton, who had first met Wildman when they were competitors in junior championships and served on the WPBSA billiards committee alongside him, wrote that Wildman &quot;brought considerable initiative, imagination and energy&quot; to the role and that &quot;his contribution to the game has never been fully appreciated.&quot;

He coached future world champion Shaun Murphy after they met in the early 1990s and also coached billiards players including Roxton Chapman, Matthew Sutton, Phil Welham and Karen Corr. After his active involvement in professional cue sports ended, Wildman moved to Spain, where he became a local champion of carom billiards. He was taken ill on 24 December 2020, and moved into residential care in Utrera, where he remained until his death on 18 November 2024, at the age of 88. Murphy remarked that &quot;the knowledge [Wildman] gave me was second to none&quot; and another former world champion, Ken Doherty, paid tribute to the quality of Wildman&#x27;s commentary. WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson said that he had been inspired by Wildman&#x27;s &quot;great vision for the global development of our sport&quot;. Marcus Stead, editor of &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; magazine, wrote that Wildman &quot;had a reputation as a savvy businessman and a shrewd operator. But he was also a man of great charm, personal kindness, an impeccable manners&quot;.

<doc id="707841" wikidata="Q310919" url="?curid=707841" title="Β-Alanine">
<text>β-Alanine (&quot;beta&quot;-alanine) is a naturally occurring beta amino acid, which is an amino acid in which the amino group is attached to the β-carbon (i.e. the carbon two carbon atoms away from the carboxylate group) instead of the more usual α-carbon for alanine (α-alanine). The IUPAC name for β-alanine is 3-aminopropanoic acid. Unlike its counterpart α-alanine, β-alanine has no stereocenter.

==Biosynthesis and industrial route==
In terms of its biosynthesis, it is formed by the degradation of dihydrouracil and carnosine. β-Alanine ethyl ester is the ethyl ester which hydrolyses within the body to form β-alanine. It is produced industrially by the reaction of ammonia with β-propiolactone.

Sources for β-alanine includes pyrimidine catabolism of cytosine and uracil.

==Biochemical function==
β-Alanine residues are rare. It is a component of the peptides carnosine and anserine and also of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), which itself is a component of coenzyme A. β-alanine is metabolized into acetic acid.

=== Precursor of carnosine ===
β-Alanine is the rate-limiting precursor of carnosine, which is to say carnosine levels are limited by the amount of available β-alanine, not histidine. Supplementation with β-alanine has been shown to increase the concentration of carnosine in muscles, decrease fatigue in athletes, and increase total muscular work done. Simply supplementing with carnosine is not as effective as supplementing with β-alanine alone since carnosine, when taken orally, is broken down during digestion to its components, histidine and β-alanine. Hence, by weight, only about 40% of the dose is available as β-alanine.

Because β-alanine dipeptides are not incorporated into proteins, they can be stored at relatively high concentrations. Occurring at 17–25 mmol/kg (dry muscle), carnosine (β-alanyl--histidine) is an important intramuscular buffer, constituting 10-20% of the total buffering capacity in type I and II muscle fibres. In carnosine, the pKa of the imidazolium group is 6.83, which is ideal for buffering.

=== Receptors ===
Even though much weaker than glycine (and, thus, with a debated role as a physiological transmitter), β-alanine is an agonist next in activity to the cognate ligand glycine itself, for strychnine-sensitive inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) (the agonist order: glycine ≫ β-alanine &gt; taurine ≫ alanine, -serine &gt; proline).

β-alanine has five known receptor sites, including GABA-A, GABA-C a co-agonist site (with glycine) on NMDA receptors, the aforementioned GlyR site, and blockade of GAT protein-mediated glial GABA uptake, making it a putative &quot;small molecule neurotransmitter.&quot;

== Athletic performance enhancement ==
There is evidence that β-alanine supplementation can increase exercise and cognitive performance, for some sporting modalities, and exercises within a 0.5–10 min time frame. β-alanine is converted within muscle cells into carnosine, which acts as a buffer for the lactic acid produced during high-intensity exercises, and helps delay the onset of neuromuscular fatigue.

Ingestion of β-alanine can cause paraesthesia, reported as a tingling sensation, in a dose-dependent fashion. Aside from this, no important adverse effect of β-alanine has been reported, however, there is also no information on the effects of its long-term usage or its safety in combination with other supplements, and caution on its use has been advised. Furthermore, many studies have failed to test for the purity of the supplements used and check for the presence of banned substances.

== Metabolism ==
β-Alanine can undergo a transamination reaction with pyruvate to form malonate-semialdehyde and -alanine. The malonate semialdehyde can then be converted into malonate via malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Malonate is then converted into malonyl-CoA and enter fatty acid biosynthesis.

Alternatively, β-alanine can be diverted into pantothenic acid and coenzyme A biosynthesis.

<doc id="707844" wikidata="Q3402678" url="?curid=707844" title="Presto Studios">
<text>Presto Studios was a computer game development company of the 1990s. The company is notable for its award-winning series &quot;The Journeyman Project&quot; as well as &quot;Myst III: Exile, the&quot; 2001 sequel to Cyan&#x27;s Myst series.

In August 2002, Presto Studios shut down new development after the release of the Xbox title &quot;Whacked!&quot;. In a statement, Greg Uhler (executive producer) announced the closing of the company:

Due to business, financial, and personal reasons, Presto Studios is discontinuing software development. Whacked! for the Xbox will be the last product that we ship. The company will remain as a corporate entity for many years, but will not be developing products. A minimal staff, including Michel and myself, will be here until the end of October.

==Closure of the company==
&quot;Whacked!&quot; for Xbox was Presto Studios&#x27; final title before closing its doors shortly afterward. Though still in decent financial shape, Presto was facing an uphill challenge in the transition from the PC to console game market. The directors of the company anticipated a rapidly shrinking PC game market and decided to close the company while it was ahead. A significant number of the creative staff moved on to high-profile roles in motion picture and animation production.

==Games==
==&quot;Beneath&quot;==
&quot;Beneath&quot; is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Presto Studios that was scheduled to be published by Activision in 1999, but was cancelled.

In 1906, Jack Wells travels to the Arctic in search of his father, who has gone missing on an archeological expedition. The exploration leads underground into a vast subterranean world.

The 3D game engine was to feature 16-bit graphics and hardware acceleration.

<doc id="707852" wikidata="Q125544926" url="?curid=707852" title="Student Unity">
<text>Student Unity (also known as SU or simply Unity) is a factional grouping within the Australian National Union of Students (NUS). It is politically aligned towards the Right or Labor Unity faction of the Australian Labor Party, in contrast to the National Labor Students faction, which is aligned to the Left. Student Unity usually represents itself by means of a yin-yang logo, representing its position as the centre of the Australian political spectrum.

The faction views itself as being committed to both fiscal responsibility and lobbying for progressive causes, while its more left-wing opponents are critical of the faction&#x27;s approach to social policy and view the faction as conservative and machinist.

==Student Unity Policy==

Aware of the financial collapse of NUS&#x27;s forerunner, the Australian Union of Students, the faction&#x27;s policy places particular emphasis on financial management and administration. The faction often votes against motions supporting issues that do not directly affect students or are felt to be too radical. Its belief is that the primary focus of the NUS should be issues directly relevant to students, and that pursuing advocacy on other, less student-specific causes would be an inappropriate use of NUS funds.

Student Unity policy is generally consistent with the policies of the Right faction of the Australian Labor Party, holding positions generally in favour of private education, free trade and private health coverage. Among the Labor student factions it is the only faction to support HECS.

Like the Australian Labor Party, Student Unity utilises conscience voting on controversial debates such as abortion and reproductive rights, drug policies and other ethical issues.

Critics of the faction argue that this leads to support of moral and social conservatism, but the faction argues that it allows the faction to unite moderate and progressive students under a single banner without splitting the faction on issues that are not critical to student services.

==History==

The faction formed in 1991, when David Feeney led members of the Labor Right to split with the Labor Left caucus, electing Pablo Campillos as NUS General Secretary, and refusing to back future Australian Democrats leader Natasha Stott Despoja for President of the Union.

Since then, Unity has become one of the biggest factions in NUS, with a presence in most Australian states and territories.

Until 2006, the faction had successfully retained the position of NUS National General Secretary every year since its inception, due to a &#x27;sweetheart&#x27; deal with the former National Organisation of Labor Students caucus. At the 2006 Conference, the faction failed to obtain the position of General Secretary for the first time in its history, the position going to an independent.

However at the 2007 Conference, Student Unity produced a strong 33% of the national delegate vote and succeeded in electing a General Secretary, thus returning Student Unity to a significant role in NUS for the 2008.

<text>The Separate Representation of Voters Act No. 46 was introduced in South Africa on 18 June 1951. Part of the legislation during the apartheid era, the National Party introduced it to enforce racial segregation, and was part of a deliberate process to remove all non-white people from the voters&#x27; roll and revoke the Cape Qualified Franchise system.

This act was declared invalid by the Supreme Court when challenged in the case of &quot;Harris v Minister of the Interior 1952(2) SA 428(AD)&quot;; this gave rise to the Coloured vote constitutional crisis. The government, however, was able to circumvent the court&#x27;s decision by increasing the number of Appellate Division judges from five to eleven, and increasing the size of the Senate from forty-eight to eighty-nine. These changes enabled the government to successfully introduce the South Africa Act Amendment Act No 9 of 2 March 1956, effectively overturning the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision and revalidating the act. This amendment was repealed by the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 32 of 1961. This case was one of many where South Africa&#x27;s parliamentary sovereignty enabled the passing of laws without being subject to judicial review on substantive grounds. The judiciary was bound therefore leaving the legislature and executive to act independently from the third arm of government. Arguably this silencing of the judiciary allowed the Apartheid state to become further entrenched in the legal sphere of South Africa.

The act as a whole was repealed by section 4 of the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act No 50 of 27 March 1968. This act introduced the Coloured Persons Representative Council, consisting of forty elected members and twenty nominated members. This council could make laws on finance, local government, education, community welfare and pensions, rural settlements and agriculture which affected coloured people. A bill could only be introduced when approved by the Minister of Coloured Relations, as well as requiring the approval of the white Cabinet. This act was repealed in 1983 by section 101(1) of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act No 110, which enacted the South African Constitution of 1983 and its Tricameral Parliament.

<text>The 400 metres hurdles is a track and field hurdling event. The event has been on the Olympic athletics programme since 1900 for men and since 1984 for women.

On a standard outdoor track, 400 metres is the length of the inside lane, once around the stadium. Runners stay in their lanes the entire way after starting out of the blocks and must clear ten hurdles that are evenly spaced around the track. The hurdles are positioned and weighted so that they fall forward if bumped into with sufficient force, to prevent injury to the runners. Although there is no longer any penalty for knocking hurdles over, runners prefer to clear them cleanly, as touching them during the race slows runners down.

The current men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s world record holders are Karsten Warholm with 45.94 seconds and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone with 50.37 seconds. Compared to the 400 metres run, the hurdles race takes the men about three seconds longer and the women four seconds longer. Men clear hurdles that are high, while women negotiate barriers.

The 400 m hurdles was held for both sexes at the inaugural IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The first championship for women came at the 1980 World Championships in Athletics – being held as a one-off due to the lack of a race at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

==History==

The first awards in a men&#x27;s 400 m hurdles race were given in 1860 when a race was held in Oxford, England, over a course of 440 yards (402.336 m). While running the course, participants had to clear twelve wooden hurdles, over 100 centimetres tall, that had been spaced in even intervals.

To reduce the risk of injury, somewhat more lightweight constructions were introduced in 1895 that runners could push over. However, until 1935 runners were disqualified if they pushed over more than three hurdles in a race and records were only officially accepted if the runner in question had cleared all hurdles clean and left them all standing.

The 400 m hurdles became an Olympic event at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. At the same time, the race was standardized; thus, virtually identical races could be held and the finish times compared to one other. As a result, the official distance was fixed to 400 metres, or one lap of the stadium, and the number of hurdles was reduced to ten. The official height of the hurdles was set to . The hurdles are now placed on the course with a run-up to the first hurdle of 45 metres, distance between the hurdles of 35 metres each, and home stretch from the last hurdle to finish line of 40 metres.

The first documented 400 m hurdles race for women took place in 1971. In 1974, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), now known as World Athletics, introduced the event officially as a discipline, with hurdles at the lower height of . The women&#x27;s race was not run at the Olympics until the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles where it was first staged with the first Men&#x27;s World Champion having been crowned the year before at the inaugural World Athletics Championships. A special edition of the Women&#x27;s 400m Hurdles took place in the 1980 IAAF World Championships in Athletics in response to the Women&#x27;s 400m Hurdles not being included at the boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, and Liberty Bell Classic.

Many athletic commentators and officials have often brought up the idea of lifting the height of the women&#x27;s 400 m hurdles to incorporate a greater requirement of hurdling skill. This is a view held by German athletic coach Norbert Stein, &quot;All this means that the women&#x27;s hurdles for specialists, who are the target group to be dealt with in this discussion, is considerably depreciated in skill demands when compared to the men&#x27;s hurdles. It should not be possible in the women&#x27;s hurdles that the winner is an athlete whose performance in the flat sprint is demonstrably excellent but whose technique of hurdling is only moderate and whose anthropometric characteristics are not optimal. This was the case at the World Championships in Seville and the same problem can often be seen at international and national meetings.&quot;

==Hurdling technique==

In terms of technique and endurance, the 400-metre hurdles is arguably the most demanding event in the sprints and hurdles group. Athletes must be able to run a fast 400-metre flat time, maintain a good hurdling technique, and have a unique awareness of stride pattern between hurdles. The ideal time difference between an athlete&#x27;s 400 time and their 400 hurdles time should be between 1.5 and 3 seconds. This variation depends on the specific qualities of the athlete. At the professional level, the women&#x27;s hurdles are smaller (76cm) than the men&#x27;s (91cm) which usually makes the 400-400hs average time difference smaller for female athletes. In 2024, the two fastest 400 hurdlers in the world (Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Femke Bol) are also two of the fastest women in the open 400, based on their relay split compared to other athletes. To be able to maintain a good hurdling technique throughout the race it is important to work on step patterns. The number of steps an athlete takes during a 400 hurdles is called rhythm. Most 400 hurdlers know how many steps they are going to take in between each hurdle, starting from the block. The distance between the block and the first hurdle is 45 meters, which allows the fastest women to take 21 to 23 steps, while the fastest men can get down to 19 or 20. After the first one, the hurdles are 35 meters apart, and the tenth one is placed at 40 meters from the finish line. The internal steps from hurdle two to hurdle ten vary depending on the athlete&#x27;s abilities, speed, technique, and personal preferences. The most skilled athletes can change their rhythm depending on how fast they need, or want, to run. For example, Karsten Warholm ran 13 steps up to hurdle seven, then decided to switch to 15 steps for the last three hurdles at the Paris Olympics, because he is more comfortable going over hurdles with his dominant leg. An even number of steps in between the hurdles implies alternating which leg goes over it first (lead leg), while an uneven number of steps allows for going over the hurdles with the same leg. Furthermore, athletes must possess anaerobic endurance over the final 150 to 100 metres of the race as, at this point, lactate (the conjugate base of lactic acid) will accumulate in the body from anaerobic glycolysis.

===Block start===
When preparing to hurdle, the blocks should be set so that the athlete arrives at the first hurdle leading on the desired leg without inserting a stutter step. A stutter step is when the runner has to chop his or her stride down to arrive on the &quot;correct&quot; leg for take off. Throughout the race, any adjustments to stride length stride speed should be made several strides out from the hurdle because a stutter or being too far from the hurdle at takeoff will result in loss of momentum and speed.

===Hurdling===

At the beginning of the take-off, the knee must be driven toward the hurdle and the foot then extended. The leg position when extended must be stretched out, in a position of a split. The knee should be slightly bent when crossing the hurdle. Unless an athlete&#x27;s body has great flexibility, the knee must be slightly bent to allow a forward body lean. Unlike the 110m hurdles, a significant forward body lean is not that necessary due to the hurdles being lower. However, the trail leg must be kept bent and short to provide a quick lever action allowing a fast hurdle clearance. The knee should pull through under the armpit and should not be flat across the top of the hurdle.

It is also important that the hurdler does not reach out on the last stride before the hurdle as this will result in a longer bound being made to clear the hurdle. This will also result in a loss of momentum if the foot lands well in front of the center of gravity.

===Stride length===
Using a left lead leg on the bends allows the hurdler to run closer to the inside of the lane and cover a shorter distance. Additionally, if the left leg is used for the lead, then the athlete&#x27;s upper body can be leaned to the left, making it easier to bring the trail leg through. Additionally, an athlete hurdling with a right leg lead around the bends must take care that they do not inadvertently trail their foot or toe around the hurdle rather than passing over the top, which would lead to a disqualification from the race. Depending on the height and strength of the athlete, men work toward a stride pattern of 13 to 15 steps between each hurdle, and women work toward a stride pattern of 15 to 17. This does not include the landing step from the previous hurdle. Edwin Moses was the first man to keep 13 strides throughout an entire race. Weaker athletes will typically hold a longer step pattern throughout the race so that they do not bound or reach with each step, which also results in a loss of speed. These patterns are ideal because it allows the hurdler to take off from their predominant leg throughout the race without switching legs. However, fatigue from the race will knock athletes off their stride pattern and force runners to switch legs. At an early age, many coaches train their athletes to hurdle with both legs. This is a useful skill to learn since as a runner tires, their stride length may decrease, resulting in the need either to add a stutter stride, or to take a hurdle on the other leg. Even though some athletes prefer using their dominant leg as lead, every professional knows how to go over hurdles with both legs. Some athletes have started choosing an even rhythm (Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone does 14 steps for most of her race).

==Most successful athletes==
American athlete Glenn Davis had a prodigious start to his hurdling career, running his first race in April 1956 in 54.4 s. Two months later, he ran a new world record with 49.5 s and later that year he won the 400 m hurdles at the Olympics, and was also the first to repeat that feat in 1960.

In terms of success and longevity in competition, Edwin Moses&#x27; record is significant: he won 122 races in a row between 1977 and 1987 plus two gold medals, at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montréal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He was undefeated for exactly nine years nine months and nine days, from 26 August 1977 until 4 June 1987. He finished third in the 1988 Olympic final, the last race of his career. He also held the world record for sixteen years from when he first broke it at the Olympics on 25 July 1976 until it was finally broken by Kevin Young at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

<text>The 400 metres, or 400-meter dash, is a sprint event in track and field competitions. It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1964 for women. On a standard outdoor running track, it is one lap around the track. Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course. In many countries, athletes previously competed in the 440-yard dash (402.336 m)—which is a quarter of a mile (1,760 yards) and was referred to as the &quot;quarter-mile&quot;—instead of the 400 m (437.445 yards), though this distance is now obsolete.

Like other sprint disciplines, the 400 m involves the use of starting blocks. The runners take up position in the blocks on the &quot;ready&quot; command, adopt a more efficient starting posture which isometrically preloads their muscles on the &quot;set&quot; command, and stride forwards from the blocks upon hearing the starter&#x27;s pistol. The blocks allow the runners to begin more powerfully and thereby contribute to their overall sprint speed capability. Maximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event, but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap. While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event, there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400-metre athletes is open to debate.

The current men&#x27;s world record and Olympic record is held by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa; his time of 43.03 seconds is the fastest 400 m ever run, in either an open 400 m or a relay. While Michael Johnson holds the fastest 400 m relay split with a time of 42.94, relay splits are typically faster because athletes have a running start and do not need to react to the gun if they are not the leadoff leg. Considering van Niekerk&#x27;s reaction time of 0.181 seconds in his run of 43.03, van Niekerk covered the 400-metre distance itself in 42.85 seconds, therefore being 0.09 s faster than Johnson&#x27;s relay split.

Quincy Hall is the reigning men&#x27;s Olympic champion. Antonio Watson is the current men&#x27;s world champion. Christopher Morales Williams is the men&#x27;s world indoor record holder with a time of 44.49 seconds.

The current women&#x27;s world record is held by Marita Koch, with a time of 47.60 seconds. Marileidy Paulino is the current women&#x27;s world champion and women’s Olympic champion, and holds the Olympic record in a time of 48.17 seconds. Femke Bol holds the women&#x27;s world indoor record at 49.17 (2024). The men&#x27;s T43 Paralympic world record of 45.07 seconds is held by Oscar Pistorius.

An Olympic double of 200 metres and 400 m was first achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984, and later by Marie-José Pérec of France and Michael Johnson from the United States on the same evening in 1996. Alberto Juantorena of Cuba at the 1976 Summer Olympics became the first and so far the only athlete to win both the 400 m and 800 m Olympic titles. Pérec became the first to defend the Olympic title in 1996, Johnson became the first and only man to do so in 2000. From 31 appearances in the Olympic Games, the men&#x27;s gold medalist came from the US 19 times (as of 2019).

<doc id="707866" wikidata="Q4792530" url="?curid=707866" title="Armadale railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Armadale railway station is a commuter railway station in Armadale, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and was opened on 7 May 1879. The station consists of an island platform and two side platforms, all accessed by a pedestrian bridge. There are two principal station buildings located on the central platform (platforms 2 and 3) and on platform 4, consisting of a small two and one-story brick buildings. These buildings were provided in 1914 as ticketing and staff offices. The station is only partially accessible due to a multiple steep access ramps.

Armadale railway station is served by the Frankston line, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station also connects to the Route 6 tram service and the route 605 bus service. The journey to Flinders Street railway station is approximately and takes 14 minutes.

== Description ==
Armadale railway station is located in the suburb of Armadale, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located nearby to the High Street shopping precinct and the heritage listed Kings Arcade. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately , or a 14-minute train journey, from Flinders Street station. The adjacent stations are Toorak station up towards Melbourne and Malvern station down towards Frankston.

The station consists of a single island platform and two side platforms with a total of four platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately 160 metres (524.93 ft) long, enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. The station features a pedestrian bridge, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. The station features two principal station buildings, both former ticketing offices which are now heritage listed staff facilities. Distinct Edwardian architectural features of the red brick station buildings include ornate parapets, cement banding, tall chimneys with terracotta pots, tiled hip roof with terracotta finials, and stucco walls. An additional station building is present onsite, 14 Cheel Street. This building is a single-storey Edwardian-era shop listed as &quot;A2&quot; grade on the Victorian heritage register.

The station building, platform, and overpass are largely the same as when originally built, with the main change being updated signage, technology, and the addition of one new platform canopy amongst other minor building and platform upgrades. There is no car-parking available at the station. The station is listed as an &quot;assisted access&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp is too steep and would require assistance for wheelchair customers to traverse.

==History==

Armadale railway station was opened on 7 May 1879, with the station consisting of a single platform and track for commuter and freight service. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Armadale House the residence of former premier and attorney-general James Munro. The house was named after Armadale, Scotland, where Munro was born. The first station buildings were opened on the site between 1881 and 1883 to coincide with the duplication of track between the city and Oakleigh. The current station was constructed in 1914 to provide improved and additional facilities to what had become an increasingly busy and important location on the train network. The station rebuild was part of level crossing removal works that removed all level crossings, rebuilt all stations, and quadruplicated the corridor between South Yarra and Caulfield by 1914. Later in 1922, the line was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires with three-position signalling also introduced.

The station has mostly stayed the same since 1914, with only minor upgrades taking place. In 1972, the island platform (Platforms 2 and 3) was extended at both ends. In 1978, a former goods siding and associated point work were permanently closed before being removed. In 1993, major re-signalling works occurred between Toorak and Caulfield stations. The station underwent minor upgrades with the installation of a new shelter on Platform 1 in the 2010s. In 2021, resignalling works occurred to upgrade the corridor to high capacity signalling as part of the Metro Tunnel project.

Located next to the station entrance on 14 Cheel Street is a class A2 heritage listed single-storey Edwardian-era shop. This building was previously a general store, however, in 2015 structural problems emerged inside the building forcing the closure of the store and eviction of the tenants. The structure has been reinforced due to the inability to demolish the building, due to its &quot;high local significance that act as an important milestone in the development of the region or the municipality, and that it may illustrate one or more of the key local historical themes.&quot; In 2022, a permanent fence was installed on the platform replacing the existing temporary fence.

<text>Malvern railway station is a commuter railway station that is part of the Melbourne railway network in Victoria, Australia. The station is located on the southern border of Malvern, a suburb of Melbourne, and was opened on 7 May 1879. The station complex consists of an island platform and two side platforms all accessed by a pedestrian bridge. There are two red brick Edwardian-era station buildings, constructed in 1914 as ticketing and staff offices. The entire complex is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register because of its architectural significance and its role in the development of Malvern as a significant metropolitan centre. The station is only partially accessible because of multiple steep access ramps.

Malvern railway station is served by the Frankston line, with limited services on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines. The station also connects to route 16 and 64 tram services. The journey to Flinders Street railway station is approximately and takes 15 minutes.

== Description ==
Malvern railway station is on the boundary of Malvern and Caulfield North, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. East of the station is Glenferrie Road, and south of the station is Dandenong Road. The station is located nearby to the Glenferrie Road shopping precinct, Malvern Central Shopping Centre, and the Malvern Collective apartments. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains. The station is , or a 15-minute train journey, from Flinders Street station. The adjacent stations are Armadale station up towards Melbourne and Caulfield station down towards Dandenong or Frankston.


The station consists of a single island platform and two side platforms. The platforms are of standard design for the Melbourne commuter rail network, with an asphalt surface and concrete edges. The platforms are approximately 160 metres (524.93 ft) long, enough for a Metro Trains 7-car High Capacity Metro Train (HCMT). The station features a pedestrian bridge, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. The station has two station buildings that were former ticketing offices and are now used as staff facilities. Distinct Edwardian architectural features of the two red brick station buildings include tiled hip roof with terracotta finials, tall chimneys with terracotta pots, ornate parapets, cement banding, and stucco walls. These features are similar to those of other stations constructed in eastern Melbourne in the same period, including the nearby stations Hawksburn, Toorak, and Armadale. The entire complex is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register because of its architectural significance and its role in the development of Malvern as a significant metropolitan centre.

There is no dedicated car-parking available at the station, instead there are a limited number of on-street parking spaces for travellers to use. The station is listed as an &quot;assisted access&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp is too steep and would require assistance for wheelchair customers to traverse.

==History==
Malvern station is situated on Crown Allotment 59, purchased in 1854 by Thomas Fulton, Lauchlan Mackinnon, and Frederick Sargood for a sum of £310. The land was promptly divided into smaller plots, and by 1865, property at the intersection of Glenferrie Road and Dandenong Road had been purchased by William Chandler, a market gardener. In 1874, the Secretary of the Malvern Shire, Smith Ellis, lobbied the Commissioner of Roads and Railways, arguing for the proposed Gippsland Railway to be routed through Malvern. He claimed that the route would capture a substantial portion of the daily commuter traffic that was currently using other means of transport to and from the city. In 1877, the State Government obtained the assets of the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company. A decision was reached to extend the railway line from South Yarra through Malvern, Caulfield, and Oakleigh. This extension would link the suburban railway network with the government&#x27;s country service, providing access to Gippsland. During the surveying of the Malvern section, the railway line&#x27;s path crossed William Chandler&#x27;s property, including his house and land. Consequently, in 1878, the Board of Land and Works acquired his property for the purpose of constructing the railway.

Malvern railway station was opened on 7 May 1879, with the station consisting of a single platform and track for commuter and freight service. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the Malvern Hill Estate. The housing lots within the estate were sold by barrister Charles Skinner in 1856, who named the estate after the Malvern Hills in Herefordshire, England. The first station buildings were opened on the site between 1881 and 1883 to coincide with the duplication of track between the city and Oakleigh. In 1888, postal authorities established an office at the station due to the high volume of mail passing through the station.

The current station was constructed in 1914. It was designed by James Hardy, chief architect for the Department of Way and Works, to provide improved and additional facilities to what had become an increasingly busy and important location on the train network. The station rebuild was part of level crossing removal works that removed all level crossings, rebuilt all stations, and quadruplicated the corridor between South Yarra and Caulfield by 1914. Whilst these removals did bring positive safety benefits to the community, reports have highlighted that these works incidentally made pedestrian conditions worse, due to limited pedestrian crossings around the station and difficult transfers with tram services. Later in 1922, the line was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires, with three-position signalling also introduced.

In 1924, gas lighting at the station was replaced with electric lights. In 1988, the former electrified goods yard were removed. This platform had been used for cargo and postal deliveries during its operational life, however was decommissioned after the reduction in use. The station underwent minor upgrades with the installation of new shelters on Platform 1 in the 2010s. In September 2021, High Capacity Metro Trains used on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines were certified to stop at platforms 3 and 4 only, due to the Frankston line not receiving approval for their use.

In 2015, Stonnington Council rezoned land surrounding the station to allow for higher density residential and commercial development. Following this decision, Kokoda Property acquired multiple parcels of land immediately south of the station to construct two apartment towers. The $260 million development, known as the Malvern Collective, consists of two towers, one with 73 apartments and the other with 192. The project also includes the construction of a small supermarket, offices, and other retail spaces. The project is currently under construction and set to be complete by 2024.

== Incidents ==
Numerous incidents have occurred at the station since its opening in 1879. In the period from 1879 to 1888, there were three fatal accidents at the station. A fire occurred at the joinery works adjacent to the station in 1911, causing about £2000 worth of property. Another four fatalities at the station occurred between 1918 and 1940. 

In 1935, a cow escaped from its herd near Dandenong and Orrong roads in Armadale and made its way to the platforms at Malvern station. The cow injured a woman who was knocked over in the process, with the cow eventually being caught in a nearby garage.

In September 1936, a 47-year-old woman fell from the platform moments before a train arrived and flung herself between the rails. The train&#x27;s first carriage passed over the spot where she lay, with only about 18 inches of clearance. Despite the ordeal, she only suffered minor facial abrasions and shock.

In June 2014, a 17 year old Beaumaris male was fatally injured when he leaned out of a moving train 200m from Malvern station. The teenager, accompanied by two others, had broken into the back carriage of the Frankston-bound train before leaning outside. The teenager&#x27;s head struck a fixed object, and he later died from his injuries.

== Platforms and services ==


The station is currently served by Pakenham, Cranbourne, and Frankston line trains—all on the metropolitan railway network. The Pakenham line runs between East Pakenham station and Flinders Street station via the City Loop. The Cranbourne line also follows a similar route, joining the Pakenham line at Dandenong before continuing to the city. Due to low patronage, the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines only stop at the station during off-peak periods. The Frankston line runs from Frankston station south east of Melbourne, joining the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines at Caulfield station before continuing onto the Werribee or Williamstown lines via Flinders Street station. From 2025, the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines will run via the Metro Tunnel before continuing onto the Sunbury line to Sunbury.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited stop services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Frankston

Platform 3:
* off-peak express services to Flinders Street
* off-peak express services to Flinders Street

Platform 4:
* off-peak all stations services to East Pakenham
* off-peak all stations services to Cranbourne

From 2025, the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines will be connected to the Sunbury line via the Metro Tunnel. From 2029, the lines will also be connected to the Melbourne Airport rail link.

==Transport links==
Malvern station has two tram connections with no bus connections (except train replacement bus stops located adjacent to the station). The route 16 tram service operates from nearby Glenferrie Road up towards the city and down towards Kew. The route 64 tram service operates from nearby Dandenong Road up towards the city and down towards East Brighton. The station has an accessible platform tram stop for routes 16 and 64 on adjacent Dandenong road.

<doc id="707870" wikidata="Q5054526" url="?curid=707870" title="Caulfield railway station">
<text>Caulfield railway station is a commuter railway station on the northern boundary of Caulfield East, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Opened in 1879 and rebuilt from 1913 to 1914, the station complex is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is noted as an example of Federation Free Style architecture. It is named after the nearby suburb of Caulfield, located southwest of the station.

The station consists of an island platform and two side platforms, all accessed by a pedestrian underpass. There are three principal station buildings located on the platforms, including a small brick building located on Platform 1, near the main platform building. This building was provided in 1974 and originally served as a ticket office for the Caulfield Racecourse, which is directly adjacent. The station complex also features a rare &quot;horse platform&quot; used when horses were delivered to the racecourse. The station is only partially accessible due to a steep access ramp.

Caulfield railway station is served by the Pakenham, Cranbourne, Frankston, and Gippsland lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. The station also connects to the Route 3 tram service and routes 624 and 900 bus services. The journey to Flinders Street railway station is approximately and takes 19 minutes.

== Description ==
Caulfield railway station is on the boundary of Caulfield East and Malvern East, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. North of the station is Dandenong Road, and south of the station is Normanby Road. The station is located nearby to the Caulfield Village apartment and shopping complex, Caulfield Racecourse, and Monash University. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is primarily operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately , or a 19-minute train journey, from Flinders Street railway station. The adjacent stations are Malvern station up towards Melbourne and Carnegie and Glen Huntly stations down towards Dandenong or Frankston.

Designed by railway architect J. W. Hardy, the station complex was built in 1913–1914 in the Federation Free Classical style. The station consists of a single island platform and two side platforms with a total of four platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately long, enough for a 7-car HCMT. The station has a pedestrian subway, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. In addition to the four passenger platforms, there is a horse platform which Heritage Council Victoria notes is &quot;a rare structure of its type&quot; although its physical characteristics are &quot;undistinguished&quot;. The Caulfield Railway Complex has three principal station buildings, a former lamp/store room, and a signal box—all heritage listed.

Unique architectural features in the three red brick station buildings include elaborately decorated parapets and radiating bands of render around the arched openings. Original fittings that have been retained from the 1914 station reconstruction include the timber palisade gates, timber seating, and ticket office fittings. The signal box was built around 1920. Constructed out of red brick, it has a tiled hip roof and retains its original fittings.

The station building, platform, and underpass are largely the same as when originally built, with the main changes being updated signage, technology, and the addition of two new ramp canopies, amongst other minor building and platform upgrades. There is a small 130-space car park on the south side of the station. The station is listed as an &quot;assisted access&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp is too steep and would require assistance for wheelchair customers to traverse.

== History ==
Caulfield station opened on 7 May 1879, with the station consisting of a single platform and track for commuter and freight service. The first station buildings were opened on the site between 1881 and 1883 to coincide with the duplication of track between the city and Oakleigh. The current station was constructed in 1913–1914 to provide new and improved facilities for a station that was facing rapidly increasing growth. The station rebuild was part of level crossing removal works that removed all level crossings, rebuilt all stations, and quadruplicated the corridor between South Yarra and Caulfield by 1914. In late 1922, the line was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires, with &quot;three position&quot; signalling also introduced.

The station has mostly stayed the same since 1914, with only minor upgrades taking place. In 1977, the goods yard and loading platform was closed to traffic. This platform had been used for cargo, postal, farming, and Caulfield Racecourse horse deliveries during its operational life; however, it was decommissioned after the reduction in use. In 1985, a number of sidings and their associated points and signals were abolished. The station underwent minor upgrades in 1994 and 2015–2016, and in June 1996, it was upgraded to a premium station. In July 2022, the signal box at the station was closed, with operations handled remotely from the Kananook signal control centre.

In conjunction with the Metro Tunnel project, Caulfield station has received upgrades to its heritage structures, platforms, ticketing facilities, and signage. These projects have been undertaken to make Caulfield station into a hub and major interchange station. Despite these upgrades, many news outlets and public transport commentators have called for more drastic upgrades to the station, including making the station fully accessible, increasing connectivity to other modes of transport, and reducing overcrowding that is often faced at the station.

=== Caulfield railway disaster ===
On 26 May 1926, the 6:02pm Oakleigh-bound train crashed into the rear of a stationary Carrum-bound train at Platform 4 of the station. It was the first fatal collision to occur on the newly electrified rail system in Melbourne. Three people died and about 170 people were injured.

The coroner found that, &quot;the weight of evidence is certainly against the driver in a more serious degree, and perhaps to a lesser degree against the guard.&quot; On 12 September 1926, the relieving stationmaster, who had been on duty at the time of the crash, shot and killed himself on the island platform. Later that month, a court found the driver and the guard of the Oakleigh train not guilty of manslaughter, with the rider that, &quot;In the opinion of the jury, from the evidence given regarding the running of electric trains, the precautions taken to safeguard the public at this particular point are inadequate, and should be rectified immediately.&quot;

Seven years after the fatal crash, an automatic trip system, which applied the brakes on trains entering a section against a signal, was installed at Caulfield station.

In 2011, a plaque was unveiled on Platform 4 by the Friends of Cheltenham and Regional Cemeteries in memory of the victims of the crash.

It was renamed to Glen Huntly a year later on 1 September 1882, it was then renamed to &quot;Glenhuntly&quot; on 20 April 1937. It was given its current name to &quot;Glen Huntly&quot; on 13 April 2023 as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. Glen Huntly is a below ground host station, consisting of three platforms, a single island platform with two faces and a single side platform, connected by staircases, lifts and a ground level concourse on Glen Huntly Road. The station was previously at ground level upon its opening on 19 December 1881 until 31 March 2023; however, in July 2023, a new below ground station was provided and rebuilt as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

Glen Huntly station is currently served by the Frankston line, part of the Melbourne railway network. Additionally, the station is also served by one tram route, operated by Yarra Trams, it includes the route 67 tram. The station is approximately or around 25 minute train ride to Flinders Street.

Prior to grade separation, the station was located next to a tram square, one of only three remaining level crossings in Melbourne at which tram and train tracks intersect at the time of closure. A small signal box is located at the Flinders Street end of the tram square, which historically controlled the tramway crossing.

== Description ==
Glen Huntly station is located in the suburb of Glen Huntly in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. On the east side of the station is Station Place northbound of Glen Huntly Road and Royal Avenue southbound of Glen Huntly Road and Etna Street on the west side. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately or around 25 minute train ride to Flinders Street station.

Glen Huntly consists of three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform which is located beneath the road and is connected to the Glen Huntly Road building and concourse via stairs and escalators. The length of the platform is approximately 160 metres (520 ft) long enough for a 7-car High Capacity Metro Train.

The main car park at the station is located in between Glen Huntly Road and Neerim Road, north of the station. The station fully complies with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 as there is a lift that connects to the station entrance with Platforms 1, 2 and 3.

== History ==

Glen Huntly station opened on 19 December 1881, when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the ship &quot;Glen Huntly&quot;, which docked at Point Ormond (then known as Little Red Bluff) on 7 April 1840 with typhus fever onboard. A track leading to the Point and subsequent quarantine station was later named Glen Huntly Road.

During March/April 1975, the former briquette depot at the station was demolished.

In the mid 1980s, as part of works to add a third track on the Frankston line, the western platform was converted to an island platform. The original station building on this platform, built in the 1880s, was demolished. It was replaced with a brick building, which was opened on 1 July 1987 by the then Minister for Transport Tom Roper, and former Member for Glenhuntly Dr. Gerard Vaughan. It was also during this time that boom barriers were provided at the former Glen Huntly Road and the nearby Neerim Road level crossings, in 1986 and 1987 respectively. On 28 June 1987, the up face of the island platform was brought into use.

=== Level Crossing Removal Project ===

On 30 November 2018, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Glen Huntly Road and Nerrim Road level crossings would be grade separated, with the project expected to be completed by 2024. On 21 June 2021, designs for the rebuilt station were revealed, showing that the level crossings will be removed by lowering the railway line into an approximate trench. The last train stopped at the ground level station on the evening of 31 March 2023 with the station demolished in the following days. The new station was opened to the public on 31 July 2023.


== Platforms and services ==
Prior to closure for the Glen Huntly Road level crossing removal, Glen Huntly had one island platform with two faces, and one side platform. During the morning peak-hour period, Frankston-bound services used Platform 3 and Flinders Street services use Platform 1. Platform 2, during the morning peak-hour, is used for express services which mostly don&#x27;t stop at Glen Huntly. In the evening peak-hour period, Frankston-bound services use Platform 2 whilst express services pass the station through Platform 3.

When the station was reconstructed and reopened in July 2023, the one island and one side platform configuration was retained with the same platform numbering. Flinders Street services resumed using platform 1 while Frankston-bound services began to use Platform 3 only. Platform 2 is not regularly used, with non-stopping express trains passing the platform in the peak hour. However, the platform is bi-directional and can be used by both Flinders Street and Frankston-bound services if required.

The station is currently served by the Frankston line, which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The Frankston line runs from Frankston station south east of Melbourne, joining the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines at Caulfield station before continuing onto the Werribee or Williamstown lines via Flinders Street station.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* No services stop at this platform. Peak hour services run express through this station.

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Ormond railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Ormond, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Ormond station is a below ground host station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 2016.

Initially opened as North Road, the station was given its current name of Ormond on 1 September 1897.

==History==
Ormond station opened on 19 December 1881, when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Francis Ormond, a grazier and philanthropist in religion and education. Ormond was later elected to the Parliament of Victoria in 1882 as a member of the Legislative Council.

In 1922, the station was closed to goods traffic. A siding at the station was removed in that same year.

In 1968, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former North Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. In 1974, all interlocking at the station was abolished. Also in that year, an island platform and a side platform for services operating in the down direction was provided.

On 28 June 1987, the up face of the former surface-level island platform was brought into use.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Ormond to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

In May 2014, the Victorian Government announced a grade separation project to remove the North Road level crossing, requiring the station to be rebuilt. On 25 March 2016, the station temporarily closed, to allow its demolition and rebuilding below ground level. On 29 August of that year, the rebuilt station opened.

==Platforms and services==
Ormond has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. Until 2023, in the morning peak-hour, Frankston-bound services used Platform 3, with Flinders Street-bound services using Platforms 1 and 2. At other times, Frankston-bound services used Platform 2.

Following the re-construction of Glen Huntly station in July 2023, Frankston-bound services use Platform 3, while Platform 2 is not regularly used and non-stopping express trains pass the platform in the peak hour.

It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* No services stop at this platform. Peak hour services run express through this station.

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>McKinnon railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of McKinnon, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. McKinnon station is a below ground unstaffed station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 1 September 1884, with the current station provided in 2016.

Initially opened as McKinnon Road, the station was given its current name of McKinnon on 14 December 1885.

==History==

McKinnon station opened on 1 September 1884, almost three years after the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. The station gets its name from McKinnon Road, which was reputedly named after a local settler.

In 1928, mechanically-operated boom gates were provided at the former McKinnon Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. It was the only instance of these type of gates being used at a level crossing in Victoria. In 1974, they were replaced with conventional boom barriers.

During 1976, the down platform (Platform 3) at the former ground level station was provided. Just over a decade later, on 28 June 1987, the up face of the former island platform was brought into use.

In May 2015, the Victorian State Government announced a grade separation project to replace the McKinnon Road level crossing, immediately south of the station. This included rebuilding the station. On 1 August 2016, the rebuilt station opened.

==Platforms and services==
McKinnon has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. Prior to being closed for its 2016 rebuild, in the morning peak-hour, Frankston-bound services used Platform 3, with Flinders Street-bound services using Platforms 1 and 2. At other times, Frankston-bound services used Platform 2.

Following the re-construction of Glen Huntly station in July 2023, Frankston-bound services use Platform 3, while Platform 2 is not regularly used and non-stopping express trains pass the platform in the peak hour.

It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

<text>Bentleigh railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Bentleigh, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Bentleigh station is a below ground premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 2016.

Initially opened as East Brighton, the station was given its current name of Bentleigh on 1 May 1907.

== History ==

Bentleigh station opened on 19 December 1881, when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Thomas Bent, former Premier of Victoria between 1904 and 1909.

A goods siding once existed at the station. It closed in 1922, and it and the connections to the siding were removed in that same year. In 1944, a crossover at the down end of the station was abolished.

In 1974, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Centre Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station.

On 28 June 1987, the up face of the former ground level island platform was brought into use. The former pedestrian underpass was also provided during this time.

In 1998, Bentleigh was upgraded to a premium station. Prior to the works, Bentleigh closely resembled McKinnon. Also around this time, the underpass was filled in.

In 2006, the station&#x27;s former pedestrian level crossing was upgraded as part of a VicTrack trial of new crossing technology. Additional warning devices were also fitted, with the common red pedestrian sign, as well as an LED light box saying &quot;Another Train Coming&quot;, which is lit when either an express train is approaching on the southbound line, or when a train is approaching after another train on the northbound line.

In May 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced a grade separation project to replace the Centre Road level crossing, immediately south of the station. This included rebuilding the station. On 4 June 2016, the station closed for demolition. On 29 August of that year, the rebuilt station opened.

Bentleigh was one of the stations set to receive funding through the Morrison government&#x27;s controversial Commuter Car Park Scheme, where funding was allocated to stations without consultation with local councils, and which the Auditor-General labelled &quot;pork-barrelling&quot;. As of 2021, City of Glen Eira was starting community consultation over the proposal, with concerns that the funding was &quot;tainted&quot;.

== Platforms and services ==

Bentleigh has one island platform with two faces, and one side platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* No services stop at this platform. Peak hour services run express through this station.

Platform 3:

<text>Patterson railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Bentleigh, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Patterson station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 28 May 1961, with the current station provided in 1987. 

While the station had been proposed in 1930s demands from local residents intensified throughout the 1950s. 

Named after Patterson Road, which is located immediately south of the station and also provides access, construction of the station commenced in 1958. An island platform was provided, and provision made for another platform face on the eastern side of the station. A photo taken by Weston Langford(1941-2014) on the day prior to the official opening clearly shows the new &quot;middle&quot; line about to be connected (see below), and the easternmost line removed shortly afterwards. There was also a signal box located at the eastern side (down line) that has since been removed. On 28 June 1987, a third track was provided between Caulfield and Moorabbin, and platform 3 was constructed on the eastern side.

On 17 December 1994, a deliberately lit fire damaged parts of the station.

==Platforms and services==

Patterson has one island platform with two faces and one side platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* Services may occasionally stop at this platform. Peak hour services run express through this station.

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Frankston

== Art installation ==

In 2011, Pamela Irving curated a mosaic installation named Stationary Faces, consisting of a collage of various mosaic portraits. This project was funded by government department Arts Victoria (now Creative Victoria) and VicTrack, and was developed in collaboration with an estimate of 750 school students and youth services from Australia and abroad, inspired by Irving&#x27;s mosaic works.

Stationary Faces was proposed by Irving in order to combat constant vandalism in the station&#x27;s underpass, with the assistance of Rob Hudson, the Victorian parliament member for Bentleigh at the time. Irving&#x27;s aims with the project were two-fold; to contribute to a &quot;cultural sprawl&quot; alongside the city of Melbourne&#x27;s urban sprawl, and to use recycled/donated tiles and ceramics for environmental sustainability.

<text>Moorabbin railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Moorabbin, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Moorabbin station is a ground-level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 1958.

Initially opened as South Brighton, the station was given its current name of Moorabbin on 1 May 1907.

==History==
Moorabbin station opened on 19 December 1881, when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station&#x27;s name was derived from an Indigenous word meaning &#x27;mother&#x27;s milk&#x27;.

In 1957, the station was closed to goods traffic. In that same year, former sidings &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; were booked out of use.

In late 1958, the original station was relocated and placed in a deep cutting, coinciding with the construction of road overpasses for South Road and the Nepean Highway. At that time, provision was made for a third platform on the eastern side of the cutting. On 28 June 1987, the third platform finally came into use, when a third track from Caulfield was provided.

In the early hours of 6 December 1994, a fire destroyed all shops in the concourse. The concourse was rebuilt and new shops were constructed. In 1998, Moorabbin was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2014, the Station Street entrance and the bus interchange was re-built, as part of an upgrade program on the Frankston line.

==Platforms and services==
Moorabbin has one island platform with two faces, and one side platform. All platforms are accessible from the concourse via a ramp. The concourse contains a ticket office, toilets and shops.

Until 2023, in the morning peak-hour, Frankston-bound services used Platform 3, with Flinders Street-bound services using Platforms 1 and 2. At other times, Frankston-bound trains used Platform 2. Two morning peak-hour services from Flinders Street terminated at Moorabbin and return to the city.

Following the re-construction of Glen Huntly station in July 2023, Frankston-bound services use Platform 3, while Platform 2 is not regularly used and non-stopping express trains pass the platform in the peak hour.

It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* No services stop at this platform. Peak hour services run express through this station.

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Highett railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Highett, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Highett station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 1986.

Initially opened as Highett Road, the station was given its current name of Highett on 14 December 1885.

== History ==
Highett station opened when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after William Highett, a local landowner and a member of the Victorian Legislative Council.

The station was built with the endorsement of Victorian Premier Thomas Bent, who ordered the railway line be redirected through Highett, and also demanded a higher standard of departmental residences there than elsewhere. The current station building was erected in 1883 and 1884, and was refurbished in 1966. It was refurbished again in 1986, after it had been damaged by fire during the previous year.

In 1925, a railway parcels van hit a car at the nearby Wickham Road level crossing, killing eight people in the car. The gatekeeper was found not guilty of a charge of manslaughter, the jury finding the incident was due to the fault of the system, and not human negligence. In 1932, there was a shootout between a policeman and a burglar, who was killed.

In 1973, a former wood yard and a lamp room were demolished.

In 1985, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Highett Road level crossing, located at the down end of the station. The signal box for the level crossing was also abolished during that time.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Highett to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, that was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

In 2014, the Victorian State Government launched a public safety initiative which involved Protective Services Officers (PSOs) patrolling railway stations at certain times of the day. On 1 June of that year, Highett was added to the list of patrolled stations. A PSO &quot;pod&quot; to provide an office and holding cell was also added to the station.

In October 2017, two PSOs patrolling the station were shot at by a disgruntled 22-year-old, using a battery-powered mechanical handgun filled with gel pellets. One officer was struck in the temple, but was not seriously injured. The shooter, who fired from the balcony of an apartment overlooking the station, was arrested by police and charged with a variety of offences.

<text>Cheltenham railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Cheltenham, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Cheltenham station is a below ground premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 2020.

== History ==

Cheltenham station opened on 19 December 1881, and was one of the earliest stations on the Frankston line. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the &quot;Cheltenham Inn&quot;, which was opened by Charles Whorral in 1853. Whorral named the inn after his home town in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England.

In 1956, the former dock platform (Platform 1) was provided. A siding originally existed at this dock platform.

In 1966, boom barriers were provided at the former Park Road level crossing, which was located at the up (Melbourne) end of the station. In 1972, a signal panel was installed in the station building to control trains terminating at Platform 1. It coincided with the introduction of automatic signalling between Highett and Cheltenham. Also in that year, boom barriers were provided at the former Charman Road level crossing, which was located at the down (Frankston) end of the station.

In the early 1980s, a fourth track was laid into the bitumen of the former Park Street level crossing in preparation for triplication. However, triplication was only extended to Moorabbin in 1987.

There was previously a siding on the eastern side of the station, at the up end. By 1980, the wiring for the siding was deactivated, when most of the siding was replaced with car parking, and was removed altogether by 1985.

On 8 March 1996, Cheltenham was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2010, Cheltenham was identified as a key part of the Cheltenham Major Activity Centre by the Brumby Labor Government, as part of its &quot;Melbourne 2030&quot; strategic planning policy framework. In that year, Kingston City Council proposed a major redevelopment of the station environs, including a new station forecourt with a terraced plaza, giving more prominence to the heritage-listed buildings at the station, and a new taxi rank, similar to that at Mentone. However, the proposal was not implemented.

In October 2015, the station toilets underwent a refurbishment.

From its opening in 1881, the station was located between Mentone and Highett. The opening of Southland in 2017 meant that Southland replaced Highett as the closest station to Cheltenham in the up direction.

In February 2017, it was announced that, as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project of the Andrews Labor Government, Cheltenham would be rebuilt in a rail trench, to allow the elimination of the level crossings at Charman and Park Roads. The trench, in length and wide, facilitated the reinstatement of the dock platform (Platform 1) as part of a duplication of the down track. Road bridges were constructed over the rail line at Charman and Park Roads, and the previous car park was replaced with a multi–storey car park. On 16 August 2020, the rebuilt station opened in the trench, and a new station building constructed on a deck across the railway line. The former station building on Platforms 1 and 2 was later donated to the Mornington Railway Preservation Society.

=== Incidents ===
On 10 May 2008, former &quot;The Saddle Club&quot; actress Jessica Jacobs was fatally hit by a train at Cheltenham. On 16 March 2012, a motorist was killed after a train hit his car at the former Charman Road level crossing.

== Platforms and services ==

Cheltenham is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services. Until March 2020, it had two side platforms and one dock platform. The latter was served by one afternoon terminating service from Flinders Street, that returned empty to the city, but from 12 October 2014, extra weekday Flinders Street bound services began to use the platform.

Following the reconstruction and reconfiguration of the station and tracks, as of July 2020, Platform 1 has been turned into a through track, servicing all Flinders Street trains. The station now has the following configuration:

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Mentone railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Mentone, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Mentone station is a below ground premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 19 December 1881, with the current station provided in 2020.

Initially opened as Balcombe Road, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Balcombe on 1 September 1882, then was given its current name of Mentone on 7 January 1884.

It is classed as a premium station, and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==History==

Mentone station opened on 1 September 1882, when the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Mordialloc. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after the French Riviera resort Menton.

Until the 1940s, a former siding at the station existed, operating across Station Street to a timber yard.

In 1959, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Balcombe Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In 1981, the goods yard was closed to traffic. In late 1984/early 1985, a number of sidings and a headshunt at the station were abolished. Also occurring in 1985, the signal box and interlocking were abolished.

In December 2007, Mentone was upgraded to a Premium Station.

On 20 March 2020, the station was closed from 20:15 to allow for works to remove the three level crossings at Balcombe, Charman and Park Roads, and to build a new Mentone station. On 20 July of that year, the rebuilt station opened. The former heritage station buildings were retained as part of the project.

==Platforms and services==

Mentone has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Pitt Street Mall is the pedestrianised section of Pitt Street in the Sydney central business district, in the Australian state of New South Wales. Running for approximately 200 metres between Market Street and King Street, it is one block long and one of Australia&#x27;s busiest and most cosmopolitan shopping precincts. Floorspace rents are the highest in Australia, in part due to other cities&#x27; shopping precincts being longer. In 2015, its rents were the fifth-highest in the world in terms of city streets.

Despite its small size, Pitt Street Mall hosts many chain stores and more than 400 specialty stores. It is one of the flagship venues of Sydney Fashion Week held in the month of May.

==History==

Formerly a vehicular street, the mall was closed off to traffic in the 1990s and became a pedestrian mall. This was commonplace in various Australian cities at the time, in an effort to encourage &quot;walk-in&quot; business. Many prominent Australian businesses had flagship stores along Pitt Street, namely Sportsgirl and Angus &amp; Robertson. In the mid 2000s, there were attempts to make the mall a completely pedestrian thoroughfare, diverting all vans and trucks to the underground corridor from King Street to Market Street, at the southern end of the mall.

===2010–2011: redevelopment===
Along with extensive upgrades to retail areas, the Pitt Street Mall&#x27;s pedestrian area saw a A$10 million refurbishment during 2010–11. This included the provision of new seating as well as new pavers and a catenary lighting system.

==Shopping centres and arcades==
Five shopping centres and arcades are located on Pitt Street Mall:
* Westfield Sydney – Is a large, upmarket shopping centre which opened in stages from late 2010 to early 2011 and is the largest shopping centre in the CBD.
*MidCity – Is a four level shopping centre and office building which opened in 2010.
* The Strand Arcade – Opened in 1891 and is the last remaining Victorian era arcade in the Sydney CBD. 
* Glasshouse – An office and retail building located on the end of Pitt Street Mall and King Street. Opened in 1990 and refurbished in 2015.
*Sydney Arcade – An arcade originally built in 1882 and was demolished in 1954. It is currently small arcade located behind the heritage listed Victorian building located at the northern end of Pitt Street Mall.

<doc id="707893" wikidata="Q1313123" url="?curid=707893" title="Foster's Group">
<text>Foster&#x27;s Group Pty. Ltd. was an Australian beer group with interests in brewing and soft drinks, known for Foster&#x27;s Lager, now called Carlton &amp; United Breweries since the company was renamed in 2011. Foster&#x27;s was founded in 1888 in Melbourne, Victoria by two American brothers, who sold the brewery a year later.

The company was renamed prior to sale to British-South African multinational SABMiller in 2011. Foster&#x27;s wine business was split into a separate company, Treasury Wine Estates, in May 2011. In October 2016 Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller, which ceased trading as a corporation, making the Foster&#x27;s Group a direct subsidiary of the parent company. In June 2020, Carlton and United Breweries was sold to the Japanese beverage giant, Asahi Group Holdings.

==History==
Foster&#x27;s was founded in Melbourne in 1888 by two American brothers William and Ralph Foster of New York, United States, who happened to own a refrigeration plant. Cooling was necessary to brew and store acceptable lagers in Australia&#x27;s hot climate, unlike the English-style dark ales commonly brewed at the time. They sold the brewery the following year and returned to the United States.

In 1983 Elders IXL, a giant Australian diversified conglomerate, purchased Carlton and United Breweries, and renamed it Elders Brewing Group. Then in 1990, the Elders Brewing Group changed its name to the Foster&#x27;s Group, to reflect the name of their most internationally recognised product.

In 2005, Foster&#x27;s Group acquired the Australian wine-making group Southcorp Wines. This acquisition added famous brands such as Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount to the Foster&#x27;s stable and around A$1 billion to revenues.

In May 2011, Foster&#x27;s Group&#x27;s Treasury Wine Estates unit was spun off into a separate company. The first day of trading saw its share price soaring, valuing the separate entity at A$2.2 billion.

There had long been speculation that the beer sector or all of Foster&#x27;s Group would be subject to a takeover by a larger firm. Groups to express such an interest over the years have included Diageo, the British-South African company SABMiller, Molson Coors and Heineken International. Foster&#x27;s Group was renamed Carlton &amp; United Breweries (CUB), and its wine business split into a separate company, Treasury Wine Estates, in May 2011. CUB was sold to SABMiller in September 2011, valued at (US$10.2bn; £6.5bn). Foster&#x27;s Group Limited shares (ASX code: FGL) were suspended from trading on the ASX on 2 December 2011 and delisted from the ASX at close of trading on 20 December 2011.

On 10 October 2016 Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller. SABMiller was delisted and ceased trading on global stock markets, and Foster&#x27;s Group became a direct subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. As a result, Foster&#x27;s Group became a direct subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

In 2019, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Asahi Group Holdings, a large Japanese beverage corporation, would buy Anheuser-Busch InBev&#x27;s Australian assets, &quot;including Foster&#x27;s beer and Carlton and United Breweries&quot;. In June 2020, Anheuser-Busch InBev completed the sale of Carlton and United Breweries to Asahi Group Holdings.

==Business==
In 1990, Asahi Breweries acquired a 19.9% stake in Australian brewery giant Elders IXL which later became Foster&#x27; s Group.

Foster&#x27;s Group imports, licenses, and distributes a large number of brands. In Australia, Foster&#x27;s distributes the Cinzano, Perrier, Skyy vodka, Stella Artois, and 42 Below import brands among many others. While in the United States and Canadian markets, Molson brews and sells Foster&#x27;s Lager under license.

In August 2008, it was convicted and fined more than A$1 million for two breaches of Victoria&#x27;s Occupational Health and Safety Act which led to the death of a worker in 2006. The prosecution of the company by the Director of Public Prosecutions for WorkSafe Victoria resulted in a call for the company to better report on health and safety in its annual report.

CEO Trevor O&#x27;Hoy resigned on 10 June 2008 after poor performance by the wine division of the group. O&#x27;Hoy was replaced by Ian Johnston on 21 July 2008 in the position of acting CEO.

Foster&#x27;s announced yearly results which ended on 30 June 2009. The net sales revenue increases by 2.7% to A$4.5 billion. Net profit increases by 4.0% to A$741.5m and earnings per share increases by 4.6% to 38.5 cents.

In 2011, Fosters made major losses that including a write-down in the value of the wines division to A$1.8 billion that at the business&#x27;s AGM in Melbourne on 29 April 2011, 99% of Fosters Group shareholders agreed to split Fosters Group business into two separate brewing and wines companies. The wines business became Treasury Wine Estates, and was listed on the ASX on 10 May 2011. In an ABC interview in late August 2011, the Carlton United Group (Fosters beer division) announced that they would be focusing more on craft beer to meet the change in taste of the Australian drinker.

In 2011, Foster&#x27;s was acquired by SABMiller; the latter was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV in October 2016.

<text>Parkdale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Parkdale, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Parkdale station is an elevated unstaffed station, with two side platforms. It opened on 1 September 1919, with the current station provided in 2024.

==History==
Parkdale station opened on 1 September 1919. Like the suburb itself, it was named after W. Parker, an early landowner in the area.

A disused signal box was located at the Frankston (down) end of Platform 1. It was abolished in 1986, when boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Parkers Road level crossing, which was also located at the down end of the station.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Parkdale to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the level crossing will be grade separated by 2025. The project will involve elevating the line over the road, and will include rebuilding the station. In late May 2023, construction commenced on the project.

On 9 April 2023, a fire damaged the former ground level station building on Platform 1.

On 15 July 2024, Warrigal Road and Parkers Road level crossing and equipment were eliminated, with the new Parkdale station having opened to passengers on 2 August 2024, since the original ground-level station closed on 21 October 2023.

Due to the current lack of lifts at Parkdale, a shuttle taxi has been provided for passengers between Mentone and Mordialloc.

==Platforms and services==

Parkdale has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates one route via Parkdale station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<text>Mordialloc railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Mordialloc, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Mordialloc station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 19 December 1881.

Stabling facilities are located at the Frankston (down) end of the station, whilst a third track is located through the middle of station, normally only used by Qube&#x27;s Long Island steel freight train, and trains shunting into the yard. A pedestrian underpass is located at the up end of the station.

The station precinct itself has a number of heritage buildings and elements, including the cottage style historic station buildings (1882 and 1887), and the last remaining example of an Edwardian–style railway water tower (1910) in Victoria, also known as a &quot;Type H&quot; water tower.

== History ==
Mordialloc station was officially opened on 19 December 1881 by Sir Thomas Bent, who was the Minister of Railways, and later becoming the Premier of Victoria between 1904 and 1909. The station was provided when the railway line from Caulfield was extended. It remained a terminus until 1 August 1882, when the line was extended to Frankston. Like the suburb itself, the station gets its name from an Indigenous word meaning &#x27;near little sea&#x27;, or from either a creek named Moodi or Marida.

The first train to arrive at Mordialloc was a special service from Princes Bridge, which collected school children from the Brighton area. Further specials occurred during the day, with proper timetabled services commencing the following day. Six services were provided upon opening and, apart from two services, all were shuttle services operating between Caulfield and Mordialloc.

When the line opened, none of the stations between Caulfield and Mordialloc had station buildings, as noted by a reporter for &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper. However, it was also noted that the stations had sidings and platforms, with Mordialloc having a &#x27;particularly fine and spacious platform&#x27;. In February 1882, a contract was let for the construction of station buildings, for a price of £749-15-0.

On 31 July of that year, the line was extended to Frankston, and again was opened by Sir Thomas Bent. Timetabled services commenced the following day, and were initially two daily services and three services on Saturday, connecting with city-bound trains at Mordialloc. By December of that year, through services were operating between the city and Mordialloc/Frankston, with the station itself open for goods traffic.

At the start of March 1885, a turntable and a coal stage and ash pit were provided. The turntable was relocated from Berwick, with the coal stage being a new construction. In December of that year, the Locomotive Branch of the Victorian Railways recommended the construction of an engine shed, at an estimated cost of £200. However, this did not eventuate.

In 1887, an additional siding was provided, and occurring in that year, a contract was let for extensions to the station building. By May of that year, the coal stage was relocated to Flinders Street and, by March 1889, a carriage dock was abolished, to allow an extension of the platform.

In 1888, duplication of the line was provided between Caulfield and Mordialloc. The Staff and Ticket, which worked between Mentone and Mordialloc, was abolished, and the Winters Block system was provided, with the section remaining Mentone–Mordialloc. By August 1890, there were seventeen services to Mordialloc, nine of which continued through to Frankston, and two goods trains. In March 1895, Mordialloc was interlocked, with a thirty lever frame provided.

On 22 March 1896, a new lattice girder bridge was provided over the Mordialloc Creek, which is located nearby in the down direction of the station, replacing the original timber bridge, which was to the east of the new bridge. Regrading occurred at the Up end of the station, with a railway overpass built over Nepean Road. That bridge was brought into use on 16 August of that year.

In December that year, the Commissioners of the Victorian Railways inspected the station, and announced a proposal to replace the existing frame with a signal box at the McDonald Street level crossing. This did not occur, however, alterations to the tracks and interlocking did occur in February 1898, and included two additional working levers for the frame. By 1901, there were six through services (five of which were services bound for Mornington or Stony Point), and ten services terminating. This gave Mordialloc a service roughly every hour throughout the day.

In 1907, a new engine shed was provided. It was originally erected at Traralgon in 1884, and was relocated to Briagolong in 1902, when a new shed at Traralgon was provided. The following year, a new signalbay and interlocking was provided. By that date, two dead–end sidings were in service at the Down end of the station.

In 1910, duplication of the line between Mordialloc and Frankston occurred, resulting in a rebuilt and enlarged yard and a complete overhaul to the station layout: a portion of a floating goods platform from Williamstown was erected by August 1 of that year, with instructions to reduce the length of the platform to also occurring. By December 1, a second platform (current day Platform 2) was provided. The signalling was also altered, allowing Down trains to use all three running tracks if necessary. A new goods road (No.4 road) was provided behind Platform 2 to the enlarged goods yard, which was now extended to Mordialloc Creek. A new engine shed and turntable were provided, as well as the current pedestrian underpass.

On 5 January 1911, a new, elevated signal box was provided adjacent to the Bear Street level crossing, complete with a fifty lever frame. By 1 March of that year, the Edwardian–style water tower was completed. By December 1913, there were seventeen through services and fourteen terminating services, with a number of goods trains to and from Frankston, Mornington Junction and Carrum (an as–required service only) also shunting in the yard at various hours of the day.

Electrification arrived at the station in May 1922, and was extended to Frankston in August of that year. The first trail run of an electric train to Mordialloc occurred on 19 May of that year, with electric services beginning three days later, on 22 May. A trail run to Frankston occurred on 21 August, with services commencing on 24 August. Electrification, however, brought little alterations to the station, apart from some minor signalling changes. By December 1924, there was thirty through services, twenty–four terminating services and three goods services. Two train sets also stabled overnight.

Sometime around 1924, the engine shed was abolished. The Victorian Railways&#x27; Chief Engineer of the Way &amp; Works branch recommended it be relocated to Colac, but it is unsure if this happened. In February of the following year, the platforms were extended in the Up direction, to allow the operation of 7–car trains. In 1927, the former signalbay was removed, to allow improvements to the width of the platform. During November 1929, a number of roads in the yard were wired, allowing the use of electric locomotives on goods services.

On 28 December 1938, the grandstand of the nearby Epsom Racecourse was destroyed by fire, bringing an end to race traffic to Mordialloc. Prior to this, race specials were generally formed by 7–car Tait sets. Racehorses themselves were carried by train, with special services originating from Flemington Racecourse and the loading of the horses carried out at the Newmarket Stock Siding, Flinders Street and other stations as required. In early 1942, the water supply for steam locomotives was decommissioned, along with the water tower.

Post–World War II, suburbia was being extensively developed towards Mordialloc and beyond. By February 1950, there was fifty–one through services (a number of these services terminated at Aspendale), twenty–eight terminating services (with two sets stabling overnight) and a Monday–Wednesday–Friday goods service to and from Seaford, which shunted at Mordialloc twice on the days it operated.

Sometime between 1954 and 1956, the turntable in the yard was abolished. On 21 December 1955, a substation was provided near the Station Street level crossing, located in the Down direction of the station. It was provided to improve the power supply at the outer ends of suburban railway lines, allowing improved services.

Around 1961, the goods shed and platform were abolished. By May 1963, the station was serviced by sixty–three through services, with ten services that terminated, with five train sets stabling overnight. It was still served by the goods service to and from Seaford, however, this now only operated on Wednesdays.

Between 1964 and 1966, the current railway overpass crossing the Nepean Highway was provided, replacing the original 1896–built overpass. During 1967, there was consideration to extending Platform 2 to allow 8–car trains, which would&#x27;ve forced the relocation of a number of signal posts. However, a number of signal renewals did occur during this time. By November 1973, planning was underway for the extension of the third track from Caulfield to Mordialloc. This, however, has not eventuated: the third track was only extended to Moorabbin in 1987.

Automatic signalling between Mordialloc and Chelsea was provided in 1977. Between 1979 and 1982, a new concrete bridge was provided over the Mordialloc Creek, replacing the lattice girder bridge from 1896. By 1981, the goods yard was closed to traffic, and No.4 road was abolished and baulked on the Up side of the Bear Street level crossing, with the last recorded use of the road occurring when an Albury–bound passenger set was held during a shunters strike. By 1984, the overhead lines for No.4 road and the goods sidings were removed.

Three-position signalling replaced double line block signalling between Mordialloc and Parkdale in April 1986, this being the last section of double line block working on the Frankston line. Mordialloc, however, remained mechanically interlocked. This all changed in the following year, 1987: the elevated signal box was abolished, and was replaced with a signal panel that was located in the main station building on Platform 1. Boom barriers were provided at both the McDonald Street and Bear Street level crossings, located in the up and down directions of the station respectively, and all semaphore signals were replaced with three position signals. In June 1988, the elevated signal box was demolished.

In 1990, security fencing was provided for the stabling yard. On 5 December 1995, Mordialloc was upgraded to a premium station.

In early 2011, the stabling yard was upgraded. On 9 September 2013, whilst travelling through the McDonald Street level crossing, a wagon on the Long Island steel train derailed, causing lengthy delays. In October 2015, new accessible toilets were provided at the station.

On 7 October 2021, the signal panel was abolished, with control transferred to the Kananook Signal Control Centre.

On 9 October 2022, the Andrews government announced that the McDonald Street and Bear Street level crossings would be removed by 2028, along with five other level crossings on the Frankston line, it was fast tracked for removal in June 2023 projected for 2026. The designs for the new station was announced in June 2024 and will be elevated and the station to feature an island platform, the plans also show that the heritage building on Platform 2 to be kept and Bear Street to be closed off as part of the level crossing removal and McDonald Street to remain.

<text>Aspendale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Aspendale, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Aspendale station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened in April 1891, with the current station provided in 1981.

Initially opened as Aspendale Park Racecourse, the station was given its current name of Aspendale on 1 August 1905.

==History==
Aspendale station opened in April 1891 and, like the suburb itself, the station was named after &quot;Aspen&quot;, a race-winning mare owned by James Crooke, who had purchased land east of the present-day station to build the former Aspendale Racecourse. The first race meeting at the racecourse was in 1891, coinciding with the opening of the station.

In 1966, a crossover at the up end of the station was abolished. On 1 December 1969, the goods yard was closed to traffic.

In 1977, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Groves Street level crossing, located at the down end of the station. Occurring in that year, a control panel was provided. In 1981, the current station buildings were provided.

In 1992, another crossover at the station was abolished, as well as the connection to the former siding. Occurring in that year, the control panel was abolished.

In early 2014, a man was hit and killed by a Frankston-bound train, causing the boom gates at the level crossing to stay down, meaning that road traffic could not travel between the Nepean Highway and Station Street.

On 9 October 2022, it was announced that Aspendale would be lowered into a trench, as part of the removal of seven level crossings on the line. Further details, designs and a construction timeline are to be released closer to the opening of the new station in 2029.

==Platforms and services==
Aspendale has two side platforms. It is served by Frankston line trains.

Edithvale station gets it name from Edithvale Road, itself named after a local farm, &quot;Edithvale Farm&quot;, which was established in the 1850s and owned by John and Edith Greves.

In its early years, a siding existed at the on the down side before Platform 2.

In 1978, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Edithvale Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. In 1981, the former ground level station buildings were provided.

On 28 July 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Edithvale Road level crossing had been fast-tracked for grade separation by 2022. Construction started in 2020, with the former ground-level station closing on 25 July 2021 for demolition. As part of the project, the line was lowered into a trench, and the station rebuilt, along with Chelsea and Bonbeach stations. On 22 November of that year, the new below-ground station opened to passengers.

<text>Chelsea railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Chelsea, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Chelsea station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 4 February 1907, with the current station provided in 2021.

==History==

Chelsea station opened on 4 February 1907 and, like the suburb itself, was named after Chelsea in London, England. The name was suggested by local farmer Bertha Black, whose mother was originally from Chelsea.

In 1977, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Chelsea Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station. The interlocked frame was also abolished at this time, replaced by a control panel within the former signal box.

In 1984, the overhead wire for a siding at the station was removed and, in 1987, the siding was abolished.

In 2003, the control panel was permanently switched out. In 2004, a crossover that was located at the Frankston end of the station was abolished.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Chelsea to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

On 9 December 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project released designs for the removal of the Chelsea Road level crossing and the rebuilding of the station, with contracts for the removal of the level crossing signed two days later, on 11 December. In 2020, construction started and, on 25 July 2021, the station was closed for demolition. On 22 November of that year, the rebuilt station opened to passengers, along with nearby Edithvale and Bonbeach. The line was rebuilt below in a trench, with the level crossing permanently closed to road vehicles, and nearby Thames Promenade extended to the Nepean Highway.

==Platforms and services==

Chelsea has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:

<text>Bonbeach railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Bonbeach, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Bonbeach station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 15 February 1926, with the current station provided in 2021.

==History==

Bonbeach station originally opened on 15 February 1926, and was named by the Commissioners of the Victorian Railways, following a referendum to decide on a name. The other entries for the referendum included Bondi, Heathdale, Bonheath, Baybeach and Bayside.

In 1977, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Bondi Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. A control panel was also provided in that year. In 1981, the former ground level station buildings were rebuilt. In 1982, the control panel was abolished.

In 2015, new passenger amenities were added to the former ground level station, including passenger information displays, additional myki readers, a network status board and an additional shelter at the up end of Platform 1. Safety improvements, including additional CCTV cameras as well as tactile platform edges, were also provided.

As part of the Level Crossing Removal Project, the station was reconstructed to remove the adjacent level crossing at Bondi Road, with works commencing on 26 July 2021. The removal was done simultaneously alongside the grade separation of Chelsea and Edithvale. On 22 November of that year, the rebuilt station opened to passengers. The new station consists of two side platforms lowered into a trench, with Bondi Road passing overhead nearby. The former pedestrian level crossing at Golden Avenue was converted into a pedestrian overpass, whilst the crossing at Broadway was abolished.

The station was used in the Australian television comedy series &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; in episode two of series four, as the location of a Gloria Jean&#x27;s coffee cart grand opening party.

==Platforms and services==

Bonbeach has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Carrum railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Carrum, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Carrum station is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 1 August 1882, with the current station provided in 2020.

==History==
Carrum station opened on 1 August 1882, when the railway line from Mordialloc was extended to Frankston. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the nearby Carrum Swamp, the name believed to be derived from an Indigenous word describing a boomerang.

In 1947, interlocked gates were installed at the former Station Street level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station, and was the last installation of interlocking gates in Victoria. In 1977, boom barriers replaced these gates.

In 1988, siding &quot;A&quot; and the goods platform was abolished, as well as the connection from siding &quot;B&quot; to the mainline.

Approximately 100 metres south of the station was a stabling yard that could hold a number of trains. The yard, which was provided in October 1990, was replaced due to the level crossing removal works, being relocating to Kananook in May 2020.

On 20 December 1995, Carrum was upgraded to a premium station. In October 2015, additional shelters were provided, along with an upgrade of the toilets on the former ground level Platform 1.

A signal box was located on the former ground level Platform 1, controlling a crossover which allowed trains to terminate and either return or shunt into the stabling yard. In 1976, the interlocked frame at the signal box was abolished, and was replaced by a control panel. On 20 July 2019, the signal box was abolished.

During 2019–2020, the station was rebuilt as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. On 17 May 2019, the Station Street level crossing was abolished, and was followed by the closure of the station in the early hours of 6 July of that year, with a small number of enthusiasts witnessing the last services to arrive and depart. The station buildings were demolished shortly afterwards. On 17 February 2020, a new elevated rail line and station opened.

==Platforms and services==
Carrum has one island platform with two faces. It is served by Frankston line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

==Transport links==
Ventura Bus Lines operates four routes via Carrum station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:

<doc id="707902" wikidata="Q1278357" url="?curid=707902" title="Islam in the Netherlands">
<text>Islam is the second largest religion in the Netherlands, after Christianity, and is practised by 6% of the population according to 2023. estimates. The majority of Muslims in the Netherlands belong to the Sunni denomination. Many reside in the country&#x27;s four major cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht.

The early history of Islam in the Netherlands can be traced back to the 16th century, when a small number of Ottoman merchants began settling in the nation&#x27;s port cities. As a result, improvised mosques were first built in Amsterdam in the early 17th century. In the ensuing centuries, the Netherlands experienced sporadic Muslim immigration from the Dutch East Indies, during their long history as part of the Dutch overseas possessions. From the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War until the independence of Indonesia, the Dutch East Indies contained the world&#x27;s second largest Muslim population, after British India. However, the number of Muslims in the European territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands was very low, accounting for less than 0.1% of the population.

The Netherlands&#x27; economic resurgence in the years between 1960 and 1973 motivated the Dutch government to recruit foreign skilled laborers, chiefly from Morocco and Turkey – both majority Muslim countries. Later waves of Muslim immigrants arrived through family reunification and asylum seeking. Small but notable minorities of Muslims also immigrated from the former colonies of Indonesia and Suriname.

==History==

===Ottoman traders and Dutch converts===
The first traces of Islam in the Netherlands date back to the 16th century. Ottoman and Persian traders settled in many Dutch and Flemish trading towns, and were allowed to practice their faith, although most of them belonged to the Jewish or Greek Orthodox community under the Sultan. The English traveler Andrew Marvell referred to the Netherlands as &quot;the place for Turk, Christian, heathen, Jew; staple place for sects and schisms&quot; due to the religious freedom and the large number of different religious groups there. References to the Ottoman state and Islamic symbolism were also frequently used within 16th century Dutch society itself, most notably in Protestant speeches called &quot;hagenpreken&quot;, and in the crescent-shaped medals of the Geuzen, bearing the inscription &quot;Rather Turkish than Papists&quot;. When Dutch forces broke through the Spanish siege of Leiden in 1574, they carried with them Turkish flags into the city. During the Siege of Sluis in Zeeland in 1604, 1400 Turkish slaves were freed by Maurice of Orange from captivity by the Spanish army. The Turks were declared free people and the Dutch state paid for their repatriation. To honor the resistance of the Turkish slaves to their Spanish masters, Prince Maurice named a local embankment &quot;Turkeye&quot;. Around this time the Netherlands also housed a small group of Muslim refugees from the Iberian peninsula, called Moriscos, who would eventually settle in Constantinople.

Diplomat Cornelius Haga gained trading privileges from Constantinople for the Dutch Republic in 1612, some 40 years before any other nation recognized Dutch independence. Two years later the Ottomans sent their emissary Ömer Aga to the Netherlands to intensify the relations between the two states with a common enemy.

In the 17th century dozens of Dutch, Zeelandic and Frisian sailors converted to Islam and joined the Barbary Pirates in the ports of North-Africa, where some of them even became admirals in the Ottoman Navy. Many sailors converted to escape slavery after being taken captive, while others &quot;went Turk&quot; of their own volition. Some of the converted Dutchmen returned home to the Netherlands. However, this was deemed problematic, not so much due to their conversion, but due to their disloyalty to the Dutch Republic and its navy.

=== Envoys from Aceh ===
In 1602, Aceh Sultanate sent several envoys to the Netherlands. This was the first diplomatic mission of a Southeast Asian polity to Europe. The Acehnese delegation to the United Republic constituted an ambassador, an admiral and a cousin of the sultan, accompanied by their servants. In his letter to stadtholder Prince Maurice dated 24 August 1601 Alau&#x27;d-din enumerated the gifts he sent for the prince. These were &#x27;a small jewel and a ring with four big stones and some smaller stones, a dagger with a gold and copper sheath wrapped in a silver cloth, a golden cup and saucer and a gold-plated silver pot and two Malay speaking parrots with silver chains.

The envoys were treated with due respect and given a grand tour of the provinces where they visited important towns and met with local authorities; they were received by the States General and by Prince Maurice. The States General invited European monarchs to send their representatives to meet the Acehnese visitors. It was a successful strategy to give publicity to their warm relations with an important Asian ruler and trading partner at a time when Spain was still a menace in Europe.

The eldest of the envoys, Abdul Hamid, died three months after arrival and was buried in a church in the town of Middelburg in the province of Zeeland, in the presence of important dignitaries. The other envoys, Sri Muhammad and Mir Hassan, returned to Aceh in 1604 with the fleet of Admiral Steven Verhaegen.

===Treaty with Morocco===
In the early 17th century a delegation from the Dutch Republic visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against Spain and the Barbary pirates. Sultan Zidan Abu Maali appointed Samuel Pallache as his envoy, and in 1608 Pallache met with stadholder Maurice of Nassau and the States General in The Hague.

===Dutch East Indies===

In the 19th century the Netherlands administered the archipelago that would become Indonesia, a majority-Muslim country with the largest Muslim population in the world. The 19th century is also the century in which the first Muslim burial site appeared in the Netherlands, namely the tomb of Lepejou, in which a former slave from the Dutch East Indies was buried near Zwolle in 1828. In the first half of the 20th century hundreds of Indonesian students, sailors, baboes and domestic workers lived in the Netherlands, thus constituting the first sizable Muslim community. In 1932, Indonesian workers established the Perkoempoelan Islam (Islamic Association), which was a self-help organization that lobbied for the establishment of a Muslim cemetery and a mosque in the Netherlands. Both were realized in 1933. After the bloody war of Independence from 1945 to 1949 this community grew.

===The Second World War===
After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the 1940s, a number of Soviet Central Asians, who were mostly from Samarqand in what is now the Muslim-majority Republic of Uzbekistan, left their homes for the area of Smolensk, to fight the invaders. There, the Nazis managed to take captives, including Hatam Kadirov and Zair Muratov, and transported them to areas like that of Amersfoort concentration camp, where they reportedly persecuted or executed them. The victims&#x27; cemetery is that of Rusthof, near Amersfoort. Amongst those who studied their case is Uzbek resident Bahodir Uzakov.

===Immigration in the post WW2 period===
In the early 1970s, Muslims represented less than one percent of the population which grew to about six percent in the late 2010s. During the same period, large parts of the Dutch population lost their faith and the Netherlands transformed from a religious society that was segregated along the lines of Protestant, Catholic and socialist lines into a secular society which was characterised by progressive values.

During the 1960s and early 1970s the Netherlands needed a larger low-skilled work force for the labour intense economic sectors. These sectors were short of workers because of swift industrial growth, combined with higher educational levels of the native Dutch who increasingly turned to the service-oriented economy. The Netherlands concluded recruitment agreements with countries like Turkey (1965) and Morocco (1969), allowing people from these countries to stay in the Netherlands (much smaller numbers of Muslim immigrants in this time came from Tunisia and Algeria).

State recruitment of immigrant labour ended in 1973, but the number of Moroccans and Turks increased due to family reunification arrangements. A number of Surinamese Muslims came to the Netherlands before and after the independence of Suriname in 1975.

In the 1980s and especially since the 1990s, Muslims came to the Netherlands as refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Bosnia, Somalia, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Apart from asylum seekers, currently most Muslim immigration takes place through marriage migration and family reunification. Most Moroccan and Turkish 1st and 2nd generation immigrants married people from their home countries. In 2004, the Netherlands passed immigration laws which force future immigrants and their prospective Dutch partners to abide by very strict requirements. Immigrants must pass tests in their home countries, showing a sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language and culture. The Dutch partner must be at least 21 years old and prove an income of at least 120% of the minimum wage. These strict laws have caused some Dutch interested in marrying people from other countries to move to Belgium for a temporary period, in what has been called &quot;The Belgian Route&quot;.

Because of increasingly restrictive legislation on family formation and reunification, and the economic development of their home countries, the number of immigrants from Turkey and Morocco has decreased sharply since 2003. Immigrants from Turkey decreased from 6,703 in 2003 to 3,175 in 2006, and immigrants from Morocco decreased from 4,894 to 2,085. Net immigration has slumped to a few hundred a year, and has even been negative in some years.

According to the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (&quot;Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau&quot; / SCP) 2005 &quot;Annual Report on [societal] Integration&quot;, both half of the Dutch population, as well as half of the Moroccan and Turkish minorities stated that the Western lifestyle cannot be reconciled with that of Muslims.

On August 1, 2019, a ban on face coverings was implemented, making a full veil illegal on public transport and in schools, hospitals and government buildings. This followed similar bans in France, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Denmark. It does not apply to public streets.

== Islam in the Netherlands by region ==
== Demographics ==
In the early 1970s, Muslims represented less than one percent of the population. During the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the Muslim fraction of the population steadily increased due to family reunification, marriage immigration, a higher birth rate and the influx of asylum seekers, reaching about 4.8% in 2000. The growth then slowed because of stricter immigration laws, dropping birth rates and former asylum seekers emigrating to other Western countries after they had obtained the Dutch nationality. As regards future developments, demographer Joop de Beer in 2007 estimated that the percentage would have increased to 8% in 2050.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), a Dutch governmental institution, about 5% of the total population are Muslims (24 October 2007). Earlier statistics presented by the CBS showed a larger number of Muslims, but this information was solely based on ethnicity and not on religious belief. Since 2007 a reduction of around 50,000 Muslims was measured by the CBS, but this is not seen as a significant drop; it is seen as a result of improved research parameters. Secularisation of the second generation has nonetheless been observed, mostly amongst citizens of Iranian and Turkish background. Between 2006 and 2018, according to surveys the percentage of non-Muslims has increased amongst the Turkish-Dutch as 93% identified as Muslim in 2006 while 86% did so in 2018; amongst the Moroccan-Dutch citizens these percentages were 95% and 94% respectively. However, those remaining Muslim became more orthodox in their religious views. Various studies from 2006 to 2010 have observed that ethnic differences between groups are gradually being replaced with a single &quot;Muslim&quot; identity.

Like most non-Western immigrants, many Muslims live in the four major cities of the country: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. An estimated 140,000 Muslims reside in the capital where they form around 17 percent of the population. Half of these Muslims are predominantly Arabic and Berber-speaking communities from the Maghreb region, Egypt and the Middle East. Turks make up 25 percent of the Muslim population in Amsterdam. There are also relatively many Turks in Enschede, Arnhem and Zaanstad.

There were 850,000 residents who professed Islam in 2006. Of these 38% were ethnic Turkish, 31% were Moroccan, 26% were other Asian/African, 4% were European (Non-Dutch) and 1% (12,000 people) were native Dutch. Excluding Turkish and Moroccan, the largest group of Muslims were ethnically Surinamese numbering 34,000, followed by 31,000 who were Afghan, 27,000 who were Iraqi and 20,000 who were Somali. Those who were Indonesian (the early Muslim settlers in the country) numbered 7,000.

At the end of 2012 the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the number of Muslims in December 2010 to be around 4% of the total population.

==Denominations and movements==
There are about 400 mosques in the Netherlands, with about 200 Turkish mosques, 140 Moroccan mosques and 50 Surinamese.

=== Umbrella organizations ===
The Contact Body for Muslims and Government (CMO), representing approximately 80 percent of the Muslim community, discusses the community&#x27;s interests with the Government.

=== Shi&#x27;a Muslims ===

108,728 Shiites were reportedly living in the Netherlands as of 1 January 2005. This group is composed of Iraqis (43,523), Afghanis (36,683), and Iranians (28,522).

Broken down by ethnic group, Turks have more organisations than Moroccans and networks between these organisations are closer.

===Ahmadiyya===
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was organized in 1947. There are approximately 1,500 Ahmadi Muslims in the Netherlands and Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Netherlands is the main umbrella organization. Mobarak Mosque in The Hague was inaugurated by Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, who was serving as the President and Head Judge of the International Court of Justice at The Hague.

===Quranists===
Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in the Netherlands.

=== Jihadists ===

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Jihadists oppose Dutch society and the Dutch government and hold intolerant and anti-democratic views.

In 2009, the AIVD reported that armed Islamic extremists in Somalia received support from individuals in the Netherlands. In the years leading up to 2006, there was an increase in radical activity which among other events manifested itself in the assassination of Theo van Gogh in 2004 by the Hofstad Network. In the years after 2006 radical activities diminished despite continued military presence by Dutch forces in Afghanistan and material deemed provocative by Muslims, such as Geert Wilder&#x27;s film Fitna. While Islamist networks earlier had a strong local base of support centered around charismatic leaders, several of those leaders were arrested and deported by Dutch authorities or they left the country voluntarily. This led to reduced recruiting to those networks.&quot;&quot;

According to the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) in 2018, there are about 500 active supporters and thousands of sympathisers in the Netherlands.

In 2015 the AIVD reported that jihadists exploited the boundaries in the Dutch legal framework, by testing the limits of civil rights such as freedom of speech.

In 2017 AIVD approximated the number of female jihadists in the Netherlands to be about 100 and at least 80 women had left the Netherlands to join the conflict, the majority of whom joined ISIS. Jihadist women in the Netherlands encourage both men and women to believe in their ideology by entering into discussions online and offline as well as spreading jihadist propaganda. Jihadist women also help travellers to conflict zones by providing material support or putting them in touch with facilitators. They also help by hiding the fact that someone has left to join a conflict zone.

In the 2012 – November 2018 period, above 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighters in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIS. The remaining quarter have joined Al-Qaeda affiliated groups such as Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham or Tanzim Hurras al-Deen.

=== Salafists ===
In 1986, the Saudi non-governmental organization al-Haramain created the El Tawheed Foundation in Amsterdam, which created the basis of the ultra-conservative Salafist movement in the Netherlands. Three years later, the Saudi private missionary organization al-Waqf founded the al-Waqf al-Islami in Eindhoven. In 1990, also with Saudi funding, the Foundation Sounna was created in The Hague. According to a 1998 report by the Dutch security service, Salafists were a minor movement in the Muslim community. Salafist mosques in the Netherlands have a multinational crowd of visitors: from the Middle East and North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkey, while Moroccans are the predominant group.

From 2002 to 2003 onward, a small number of second-generation Moroccan immigrants were drawn to violent radicalization and some of those formed the terrorist Hofstad Network.

In 2009, the AIVD reported that Salafist mosques, while spreading an isolationist and intolerant ideology, no longer functioned as incubators for jihadist terrorism and the movement was not growing. This decrease resulted in Dutch governmental organisations to shift their efforts to other problems.

Close contacts between salafists in the Netherlands and salafist networks in the Middle East give the latter an influence over factions in the Netherlands, an influence the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) describes as undesirable. Along with &quot;official&quot; centres, there are independent preachers who organize meetings throughout the country as well as an enormous amount of material on the Internet.

In 2014, the AIVD noted that growth of the movement had resumed.

In 2014, the AIVD reported that the proselyting &quot;dawah&quot; strand of Salafism, though rejecting jihadist violence, is typified by:

* undermining the democratic legal system.
* promoting intolerance, discrimination and hatred of Jews and Shia Muslims.
* isolationism, where they strive to create &quot;enclaves&quot; enforced by suppressing dissent through intimidation and excluding those unwilling to conform. In practice few adherents observe isolating strictly.

In 2014 there were 13 Salafist mosques in the country which rose to 27 in 2018. The number of Salafist preachers was more than doubled in the same time span, from 50 to 110 according to the Dutch counter-terrorism authority (NCTV).

In 2019, an investigation by the Nieuwsuur TV programme and the newspaper NRC, investigated fifty mosque schools, obtaining educational material from ten Quran classes given by fundamentalist organisations. The investigation showed that children were taught that infidels go to hell. Punishments against homosexuals and &quot;enemies of God&quot; were glorified. In an ideal Islamic state operating under sharia law, heretics would be punished by the death penalty, adulterers stoned and magicians killed by the sword. Children were warned against having social contacts with non-Muslims. Muslims should strive to leave the Netherlands and settle in a Muslim country. When confronted with these results, an imam and a teacher distanced themselves from these elements in the material.

== Religiosity ==
In 2002, roughly 50% Muslims attended mosque at least once every 2 weeks. This was higher than the number of Roman Catholics (25%) who attended church once at least once every two weeks, but lower than the number of Calvinists who did the same (55%). By 2009, only 24% of Muslims in the Netherlands attended mosque once a week.

A 2004 study found that the importance of Islam in the lives of Dutch Muslims, particularly of second-generation immigrants was decreasing. This observation was based on the reducing participation of younger Muslims in Islamic rituals, organizations, and prayer. The study also predicted that the trend would continue with increasing education and &quot;individualization&quot;. However, the study also found that second-generation immigrants attached more importance to religion that the first generation as an &quot;individual experience.&quot; The study concluded &quot;the expression of religiosity by Muslim youth was not much different to that of their Dutch Christian or Jewish peers&quot;.

According to a 2011 survey, roughly 60% of Muslim women of Moroccan or Turkish origin wear a headscarf. The most common reasons cited for wearing a headscarf was &quot;religious obligation&quot; following by &quot;cultural tradition.&quot; On the other hand, the wearing of full veils is incredibly rare, with an estimated less than 500 Muslim women in the country choosing to don a niqab or burqa. Of the women who do wear full-face veils, 60% of them are converts to Islam. 

According to a 2018 survey very large proportions of Turks and Moroccans regard themselves as Muslim which represented two thirds of all Muslims in the country. The fraction self-identifying as Muslims is higher among those with Moroccan ancestry (94%) than those with Turkish ancestry (86%). The fraction declined in the Turkish group from 93% in 2006 to 86% in 2015, but there was no decline in the Moroccan group. Islam takes a central role for nearly all Somalis and in many ways their religiosity rose from the 2009 already high levels. Religion has a less important role for Surinamese Muslims: they pray less, visit mosques less frequently and less than a fifth wear the hijab. Research from 2009 indicated that relatively many Iranians are irreligious and that a fifth were Christian. Afghan and Iraqis are between the Iranians and Somalis in their religiosity.
==Politics==
Muslims are slightly less likely to vote in elections than non-Muslims at a rate of 69% compared to 77%, respectively. The most popular party among Muslims, is Denk.

After the 2003 elections, there were at least ten MPs from Muslim background among the 150 Members of Parliament, but as few as three among them may have been active believers, while two explicitly classified themselves as ex-Muslims. Muslims in the Netherlands are more likely to be active in municipal and national politics by means of demonstrations, petitions, contacting media outlets and attending meetings than running for office.

Nebahat Albayrak (ex-State Secretary of Justice) and Ahmed Aboutaleb (ex-State Secretary of Social Affairs and Employment, now mayor of Rotterdam) were both the first Muslims in the Dutch cabinet.

Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom was put on trial for inciting racial hatred, relating to his inflammatory comments regarding Islam in early October 2010. Wilders was acquitted on June 23, 2011, the judge citing that his comments were legitimate political debate, but on the edge of legal acceptability.

Of the 475 mosques in the Netherlands in 2018, a plurality (146) are controlled by the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet). Diyanet implements the political ideology of the Turkish AKP party and employs imams trained in Turkey. Critics of the Diyanet imams, some of whom do not speak Dutch, hinder the effective integration of Dutch-Turkish Muslims into the society of the Netherlands by promoting allegiance to the Turkish state while neglecting to promote loyalty to the Dutch state.

The Diyanet has facilitated a fusion of religion and politics (Islamism) in the Netherlands and allowed the AKP-associated party DENK to spread propaganda in mosques under its control located in the Netherlands. When Turkish migrant organizations were requested to join a statement against domestic violence, the religious attaché of the Turkish Embassy declared that domestic violence does not exist in Turkish society and all Turkish Islamic organizations withdrew their support from the statement.

== Controversies ==
The murder of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Dutch citizen of Moroccan descent, on 2 November 2004, as well as the arrest of the Hofstad Group on charges of terrorism, caused a lot of discussion about Islam and its place in Dutch society. The possibility of banning the burka was discussed in the cabinet.

Following the murder of Theo van Gogh, a number of websites appeared praising the murder and making death threats against other people. At the same time, starting with four arson attacks on mosques in the weekend after the murder, a significant number of apparently retaliatory incidents took place. By November 8, Christian churches were in turn targeted. A report for the Anne Frank Foundation and the University of Leiden counted a total of 174 violent incidents in November, specifying that mosques were the target of violence 47 times, and churches 13 times.

Between 23 November 2004 and 13 March 2005, the National Dutch Police Services Agency (KLPD) recorded 31 occasions of riots against mosques and Islamic schools. The case that drew most attention was an arson attack that led to the destruction of a Muslim primary school in Uden in December 2004. The period of heightened tensions between native Dutch and Muslim communities was also evidenced by several confrontations between what are known as the &quot;Lonsdale Youth&quot; (youth groups characterised by their preference for Lonsdale clothing, which is often popular with Neo-Nazi groups) and Turkish and Moroccan youths in provincial towns like Venray.

These incidents took place against the backdrop of increasing suspicions and anger towards Muslims, which have developed over a longer time. In May 2006, a poll by Motivaction / GPD (1,200 Dutch adults +/- 3%) found that 63% of native Dutch citizens felt that Islam is incompatible with modern European life. A poll of June 2004 found that 68% felt threatened by &quot;immigrant or Muslim young people&quot;, 53% feared a terrorist attack by Muslims in the Netherlands, and 47% feared that at some point, they would have to live according to Islamic rules in the Netherlands.

Feelings of fear or distrust coincide with a high degree of social segregation. About two-thirds of Turks and Moroccans &quot;associate predominantly with members of their own ethnic group,&quot; while a similar proportion of native Dutch &quot;have little or no contact at all with immigrants.&quot; Contacts between the groups are decreasing, notably those between second-generation Turks and Moroccans and native Dutch according to the Open Society Institute.

===Dual citizenship===
When two Muslim politicians, Nebahat Albayrak and Ahmed Aboutaleb, both of whom hold foreign as well as Dutch passports, were proposed as state secretaries in 2007 a discussion was started by the Party for Freedom (PVV) about dual citizenship and the possibility of foreign citizens to hold office. No other political party joined the PVV in their opinion. After their appointment, a motion of no confidence was entered by Geert Wilders, which also did not get any support from any other political party. A week later the PVV entered a motion of no confidence against parliament member Khadija Arib who serves on an advisory council to King Mohammed VI of Morocco; this motion was also defeated without any support from the other parties in parliament. In a country with as many as 2 million residents with dual citizenship, it would prove virtually impossible for any political party to put forward a list of candidates without the odd dual citizen. Even within the PVV itself, the policy failed when party representatives turned out to have Turkish and Israeli passports.

===Radicalisation===
Prisons in the Netherlands separates radicalized inmates from the rest of their prison inmates to stop them from radicalizing others. De Schie Prison in Rotterdam has a number of inmates in its seven-cell terrorist section. Of its total 252 inmates, about one-third are Muslim. Researcher Daan Weggemans at Leiden University found that for half the detainees he had studied, imprisonment had a confirmation of their belief that &quot;the world is hostile&quot;. For the other half, imprisonment had served as a wake-up call and they broke contact with violent jihadist networks.

The Parliament of Netherlands voted in 2016 for legislation to strip Dutch citizens who join ISIS or al Qaeda abroad of their citizenship, also if they have not been convicted of any crime. The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister Ard Van der Steur stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands. In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship.

Of the foreign terrorist fighters travelling to Syria or Iraq from the Netherlands, about 40% were female.

In 2017, imam Fawaz Jneid received an area ban which barred him from visiting Transvaal and adjacent Schilderswijk, due to having expressed an intolerant message which constituted a threat to national security. Jneid had earlier expressed homophobic views and derogatory comments towards murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh and Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali.

=== Gulf state funding ===
In 2018 it was found that at least 30 Islamic organisations in the country had received or requested money from Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, which was controversial due to those countries being linked with Salafism, a fundamentalist movement within Islam.

== Discrimination ==

TNS NIPO, a Dutch research and polling agency, observed an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment after the September 11 attacks, but claimed unfavorable views of Muslims were already high in the country prior to the attacks. According to research by Ineke van der Valk, an author and researcher at the University of Amsterdam, a third of mosques in the Netherlands have experienced at least one incident of vandalism, threatening letters, attempted arson, or other aggressive actions in the past 10 years. In February 2016, five men threw two Molotov cocktails at a mosque. Some 30 people, including children, were inside the mosque at the time but no one was injured. Dutch courts called it a &quot;terrorist act.&quot; In December of the same year, a building linked to the Association of Islamic Communities was set on fire. Police suspected it was a hate crime. Muslim students have more difficulties finding internships for vocational training. This discrimination is more present towards female students wearing a headscarfs.

According to the Open Society Institute, after the murder of Theo van Gogh in November 2004, Minister of Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk commissioned an inquiry into the radicalisation of young Muslims. The conclusion was that many of them experience alienation, feeling disconnected with both their first-generation immigrant parents and from Dutch society. Previous reports had already found that young Muslims don&#x27;t share the deep ethno-national attachment their parents feel with their country of origin, and instead are coming to identify primarily with their religion. While they participate less in religious activities than their parents, they more strongly link their identity with Islam and with the global Muslim community; radical and orthodox Islamic groups offer some of these young Muslims clear answers and a firm sense of belonging. While prior research found that the degree of religiosity in general decreases among Muslims with higher education and stable employment, the new report noted that highly educated young Muslims can also experience &quot;relative deprivation&quot; all the more strongly - the sense that despite their efforts they receive fewer opportunities than native Dutch people of the same generation - and turn to radicalism in anger and frustration.

The Party for Freedom, and its leader Geert Wilders, advocate for policies that critics say discriminate against Muslims including banning the Qur&#x27;an, taxing the hijab, shutting down all mosques in the Netherlands, and disallowing further immigration of Muslims to the country. Wilders and other PVV maintain their policies are not bigoted towards Muslims, but rather are aimed at the religion of Islam. In the 2023 Dutch election, the party won the most seats (37 out of the 150 total) in the Dutch House of Representatives.

On 29 November 2016, a majority in the Dutch House of Representatives voted to partially prohibit face-covering attire such as the niqab. Critics of the law stated that it was motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment but advocates of the law maintain it was not directed towards Muslims in particular. The political parties GroenLinks, Democrats 66 and DENK voted against the law.

===Opposition to discrimination===
Many organizations in the Netherlands attempt to combat discrimination against Muslims. Some examples include &quot;Meld Islamofobie!&quot;, the Collective against Islamophobia, SPIOR (a platform organisation of Islamic organisations and mosques in Rotterdam), the Muslim Women organisation Al Nisa, and the Turkish Forum.

<doc id="707903" wikidata="Q7440398" url="?curid=707903" title="Seaford railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Seaford railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Seaford, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Seaford station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 December 1913, with the current station provided in 1979.

A substation is located at the northern (up) end of the station.

==History==
Like the suburb itself, Seaford station is named after the English town of Sleaford, Lincolnshire. The name was suggested by local councillor Sydney Plowman, who was originally from Sleaford.

On 13 November 1957, an electric locomotive shunting in the yard derailed, blocking both lines for almost two hours.

Just before 18:00 on 5 June 1968, Tait trailer carriages 336T and 307T were damaged by fire while stabled near the station.

In 1976, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Station Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station. On 4 February 1979, Tait motor carriage 288M was destroyed by fire while stabled near the station. Also in that year, the current station buildings were provided.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the station used to accommodate stabled trains at its sidings. That was discontinued during the late 1980s due to costs and graffiti attacks. The tracks used to stable trains are still visible at the southern (down) end of the station. By December 1985, the goods yard at the station had been closed to traffic.

In April 2002, the signal box and a crossover at the station were abolished. In 2009, the car park nearest to Platform 2 was extended.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Seaford to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, that was scrapped by the Baillieu Government in March 2011.

Following a 2019 commitment by the Morrison government, the station was due to receive an upgraded passenger car park. However, that was scrapped by the same government in 2021.

In October 2022, it was announced that Seaford would be elevated as part of a project to remove seven level crossings on the line. Further details, designs and a construction timeline were to be released closer to the opening of the station in 2029.

==Platforms and services==
Seaford has two side platforms. It is served by Frankston line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates two routes via Seaford station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : to Cranbourne station
* : Frankston station – Carrum station

<text>Kananook railway station is a commuter railway station on the Frankston line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Seaford, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Kananook station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 25 August 1975, with the current station provided in 2007.

==History==

Kananook station opened on 25 August 1975, and was named after the nearby Kananook Creek. To accommodate the station and allow construction, in March 1974, the up and down lines were slewed. At the same time, the current Klauer Street overpass, located at the up end of the station, was provided, replacing the Wells Road level crossing.

In 1991, parts of the station were upgraded, including the pedestrian overpass and car-park.

The station was featured in the first episode of the television series &quot;Sensing Murder&quot;, which aired on Network Ten in September 2004.

In 2007, upgrades to the station occurred as part of the EastLink road project, linking Ringwood to Frankston. The original station building was demolished and replaced with a shelter, and a freeway noise protection wall was constructed. The former station building was a semi large fibro building at the centre of the station, with two semi-enclosed waiting areas on the platforms and a disused booking office near the entrance of the station.

To the east of the station is the access track for the Kananook Train Storage Facility, which is located north of the station. In May 2020, this facility opened.

==Platforms and services==

Kananook has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Frankston line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Frankston

<text>Frankston railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Frankston line and diesel-hauled services on the Stony Point line, all part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Frankston, in Melbourne, Australia and neighboring suburbs. Opening on 1 August 1882, features two side platforms, a terminus platform at Platform 1 and having Platform 2 for the terminus platform at the northern end of the platform and the Stony Point line services at the southern end. Its current form was constructed and completed in 2018.

== History ==
Frankston Station opened on 1 August 1882 when the current railway line was extended from Mordialloc. On 1 October 1888, the line was extended to Baxter.

In 1922, the signal box, which is located at the up end of the station and adjacent to the Beach Street pedestrian crossing, was provided, and controls the station, the stabling yards (located north, east and south of the station) and the Stony Point line, including Long Island Junction. It is still functional and in use to this day.

Until late 1960, a turntable existed at the station.

On 15 June 1981, the passenger services on the Mornington line, which originated and terminated at Frankston, closed altogether with the last service operated on 20 May of that year. On 22 June of that year, the passenger service between Frankston and Stony Point were withdrawn and replaced with a bus service, with the goods yard additionally being closed to traffic. However, unlike the Mornington line, Stony Point passenger rail services were reinstated on 27 September 1984.

In 1984, boom barriers replaced the interlocked gates at the former level crossing connecting the two sides of Beach Street, which was in the up direction of the station. In 1990, the crossing was removed and replaced by the new Fletcher Road overpass.

In 1985, construction of the second station building commenced, and was completed by 1987. On 9 November 1995, Frankston was upgraded to a premium station.

In March 2011, an extension was made to Platform 2 at the up end of the station to allow Stony Point and electrified metropolitan services to use the platform at the same time. During the 2011/2012 financial year, Frankston was the 10th-busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 2.5 million passenger movements recorded.

Between May and June 2018, the station was redeveloped as part of a $63 million project. The new station would be designed by the Australian architecture firm Genton. In May, the station was closed to allow the buildings constructed between 1985 and 1987 to be demolished. In June of that year, the new station opened to passengers.

A new $87 million dollar construction is being built for the station at the former western parking area to build a 500-space multi-deck car park, expected to open in December 2024.

== Incidents ==
On 10 June 1975, diesel locomotive B69, operating an up Long Island steel freight train, collided with Hitachi carriage 27M at the station. That carriage became the first Hitachi car in the fleet to be scrapped.

On 22 January 2021, a six-car Comeng set derailed at the down end of the station.

==Platforms and services==
Frankston railway station has one island platform with two faces, with the eastern face (Platform 2) split into a six-car platform for electric services towards Flinders Street, and a further two-car platform at the down end for Stony Point services.

It is served by Frankston and Stony Point line trains.

<text>Carnegie railway station is a commuter railway station located in the suburb of Carnegie, in the southeastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station originally opened in 1879 as Rosstown. The station received its current name in 1909 alongside the renaming of the suburb. Carnegie is an elevated premium station, consisting of a single island platform connected to the station concourse on Koornang Road via escalators, lifts and a staircase.

Carnegie station is currently served by the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. Additionally, the station is served by four bus routes, including SmartBus route 900. The station is approximately 17 kilometres (11.8 mi), or around a 33-minute train ride away, from Flinders Street.

== Description ==
Carnegie railway station is located in the suburb of Carnegie. On the south side of the station is Morton Road, and Koorang Road is to the west. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately 12.5 kilometres (7.8 mi), or around a 21-minute train ride away, from Flinders Street.

Carnegie station consists of a single-island platform which is located above the road, and is connected to Koorang Road through stairs, a lift and escalators. The length of the platform is approximately , long enough for a Metro Trains&#x27; 7-car HCMT.

The main car park at the station is located on Morton Avenue, just south of the station. The station fully complies with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, as there is a lift that connects the station entrance with Platforms 1 and 2.

==History==
Carnegie station opened on 2 April 1879 just one month after the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Oakleigh, Carnegie station, like the suburb itself, gets it name from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Originally named Rosstown, after entrepreneur William Ross, the name change occurred in May 1909 after Ross&#x27; failed speculative developments made the name unpopular. Residents supported the name change to Carnegie, who were seeking to obtain funds from the philanthropist for a library, which was to be unsuccessful.

In 1967, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Koornang Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In March 2014, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced a grade separation project to replace the Koornang Road level crossing immediately to the west of the station. This included rebuilding the station above its previous location. On 18 June 2018, the rebuilt station opened.

<text>Murrumbeena railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Murrumbeena, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Murrumbeena is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 14 May 1879, with the current station provided in 2018.

==History==

Opening one month after the railway line from Caulfield was extended to Oakleigh, Murrumbeena station gets its name from Mirambena Road, its name believed to be derived from an Indigenous word meaning &#x27;belonging to you&#x27;, &#x27;welcome&#x27;, or &#x27;land of frogs&#x27;. The name may also refer to a member of the native police.

A siding was once located at the down end of Platform 2. In 1972, it was reduced in length and, in 1977, it was removed altogether.

The station once had a signal box at the up end of Platform 1, which was removed in 1979, when boom barriers were provided at the former Murrumbeena Road level crossing, which was also located at the up end of the station.

In March 2014, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced a grade separation project to replace the Murrumbeena Road level crossing immediately to the west of the station, being done so as part of its elevated railway project. The historic station (protected by a local heritage overlay) and associated footbridge were removed and replaced with a temporary station until the completion of the project. On 18 June 2018, the rebuilt station opened, with services commencing on the new elevated lines.

<text>Hughesdale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Murrumbeena, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It opened on 28 February 1925, with the current station being provided in 2018.

==History==
Like the adjoining suburb, Hughesdale station was named in honour of James Vincent Hughes, mayor of Oakleigh from 1924 to 1925. He, with the Poath Road Railway Station League, had lobbied strongly for a new station for the area. Before the station was built, Hughesdale was the site of the junctions of both the Outer Circle and Rosstown lines with the Dandenong/Gippsland line.

In 1972, boom barriers replaced hand gates at the former Poath Road level crossing, which was at the up end of the former ground-level station.

In 1977, the former ground-level station building was rebuilt, after the original station building, which was of a timber construction, was destroyed by fire in 1975.

In 2016, the Level Crossing Removal Authority announced a grade separation project to eliminate the Poath Road level crossing immediately to the west of the station. On 14 October 2017, the station was closed, and was demolished on 28 October of that year. On 25 August 2018, the rebuilt station opened about west of the former station, as part of construction of the new section of elevated rail line between Caulfield and Oakleigh. Consequently, the station is now located in the suburb of Murrumbeena rather than Hughesdale. 

== Platforms and services ==
Hughesdale has one island platform with two faces and is served by Pakenham and Cranbourne line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to East Pakenham
* all stations services to Cranbourne

<text>Oakleigh railway station is a commuter railway station in the suburb of Oakleigh in the south-east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station opened in 1877 as the up end of the Gippsland line, with the station being electrified in 1922. Oakleigh is a ground-level premium station, consisting of two sides that are connected to each other via the adjacent roads, and both platforms are connected to each other via a pedestrian subway.

Oakleigh station is currently served by the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. The station is further served by 11 bus routes, including two SmartBus services. The station is approximately 15 kilometres (9.4 mi) or around a 27-minute train ride away from Flinders Street.

== Description ==

Oakleigh railway station the main station in the suburb of Oakleigh. On the north side of the station is Portman Street, and Haughton Road is on the south. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately 15 kilometres (9.4 mi) or around a 27-minute train ride away from Flinders Street.

Oakleigh station consists of two side platforms that are connected by a pedestrian subway, previously, platform 1 was an island platform, and the station consisted of three platforms. The two platforms have direct station entrances on their adjacent roads, with platform 1 having an entrance on Haughton Road and platform 2 having an entrance on Portman Street.

There are three car parks at the station. Oakleigh station is fully accessible as the subway features lift access and both platform entrances feature ramps.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
In 1877, the station opened as the western end of the Gippsland railway line, it received its current location in 1879, when the line was extended to South Yarra railway station.

In 1883, the track was duplicated from Caulfield to Oakleigh, and in 1891, the line was duplicated to Dandenong.

In 1888, the Rosstown line opened, with Oakleigh being the eastern terminus. Two years later, the outer circle line opened from Oakleigh to Waverley Road station.

=== 20th century ===
In , the station featured two side platforms with an additional centre track. By this time, the station was controlled by two signal boxes; &quot;A&quot; at the city end, controlling the Warrigal Road level crossing and interlocked gates, and &quot;B&quot;, between the station and yard, controlling the latter. In 1915, a new station building had been constructed to the same style as Box Hill, Caulfield, Essendon, Heidelberg and Spotswood in the Melbourne area, and Castlemaine and Warragul in the country. A new platform was provided on the south side, plus a fifth track for engines to run around their consists.

In March 1922, electrification was extended from Caulfield to Oakleigh, and this was extended to Dandenong during December of that same year. Around the same time, the Hanover Street bridge was built across the Dandenong end of the goods yard, with alterations to the passenger sidings and the run-around loop south of the station was abolished.

Three-position signalling was extended from Carnegie to the city end of Oakleigh (exclusive) in December 1940. Extension of the signalling to Huntingdale and Clayton, in lieu of Winters Double Line Block safeworking, did not occur until 1970, in conjunction with the North Road (Huntingdale) grade separation project.

In 1968, the Warrigal Road level crossing was closed, and, in conjunction with the demolition of shops, a new road overpass was provided. The original Warrigal Road surface was partially retained as a slip lane to serve a handful of shops along the western boundary. The road bridge piers were spaced to allow extension of the track from the southernmost platform in the citybound direction.

In 1975, the track layout was drastically simplified, and both signal boxes were abolished and demolished, being replaced with a new, experimental route-setting power interlocking system located in the middle of the southern station building.

The new signal panel included a &quot;switch out&quot; feature, allowing the station&#x27;s signalling to operate automatically during periods of reduced traffic. To facilitate this, the island platform was used for most trains, with high-speed (65 km/h, 40 mph) turnouts provided at either end to avoid trains slowing down significantly for the diverging movements. Station staff operated the signal panel during busier times to allow access to or from the goods yard, terminating trains, or overtaking moves in either direction.

In May 1984, the goods yard was officially closed to traffic, with the exception of briquette traffic, which was still being received. Way and Works waggon HD205, which had been parked at the city end of the through siding for years, was transferred to the Caulfield depot on 22 June 1984. By October that year, the briquette traffic had also shifted to Westall. The overhead in siding &quot;A&quot; was removed by December of that year, along with the points and the majority of the sidings.

In March 1987, a guards&#x27; indicator light was provided for signal post 16, controlling citybound moves from Platform 1.

As of April 1988, suburban timetables specified an overtaking move between outbound suburban and country trains, where the 16:53 and 17:36 departures from Flinders Street to Dandenong were each scheduled to wait 3 minutes at Oakleigh, for a Traralgon and Warragul service, respectively.

Since 1989, the station has featured over 40 plywood cut-outs on its walls and surrounding the station. These illustrate the life stories of Oakleigh residents, who were aged between 15 and 70, when the murals were unveiled in September of that year. In 2002, they underwent restoration. About half of these have since been restored, and glue can still be seen on the walls of the station building where the remainder had previously been placed.

On 12 December 1995, Oakleigh was upgraded to a premium station.

When the Cranbourne line was electrified in 1995, trains that had previously terminated at Oakleigh were extended, and the passenger train stabling sidings fell into disuse. The extended goods siding that was along the north side fell out of use and was abolished around the same time, although the shell of the citybound dwarf signal at the down end remained in place until 2018. As a result, the signal panel was generally only used when the underpass flooded, as all trains in both directions could be diverted to the north-side platform (by then renamed Platform 3). The suburban sidings were restored to service in late 2004, but were only used occasionally after that, with further periods out of service.

=== 21st century ===

In 2018, the former platform 1 was removed. As a result, the island platform on the southern end of the station was converted into a side platform, and the former platforms 2 and 3 were renumbered to platforms 1 and 2.

Throughout 2018–2019, Oakleigh was upgraded and modernised. Two concourses were built, lifts were installed, and the underpass was refurbished. Two heritage-listed buildings were maintained as originally built.

== Platforms and services ==
The station is currently served by both the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are both operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Services to East Pakenham and Cranbourne travel together south-east towards Dandenong before splitting into two separate lines. Services to the city run express from Caulfield (Malvern during off-peak) to South Yarra before stopping at all stations to Flinders Street via the City Loop.

Platform 1:
* express services to Flinders Street
* express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to East Pakenham
* all stations and limited express services to Cranbourne

Future services:
In addition to the current services, the Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposes linking the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines to both the Sunbury line and under-construction Melbourne Airport rail link via the Metro Tunnel.
* express services to Sunbury (2025 onwards)
* express services to Melbourne Airport (2033 onwards)

==Transport links==
Oakleigh Station is served by a total of eleven bus connections, including two Smartbus routes. Most routes (624, 693, 704, 742, 800, 802, 804, 862, and Smartbus Routes 900 and 903) serve the bus interchange on Portman Street just north of the railway station. Whereas bus routes 625, 701, and 733 serve the bus stop on Johnson Street. On Haughton Road there is a rail replacement bus stop used during rail works on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines mainly along the Westall to Caulfield section.

<text>Huntingdale railway station is a commuter railway station located adjacent to the suburbs of Oakleigh and Huntingdale located in the south east of Melbourne, Victoria in Australia. The station originally opened in 1927 as &quot;East Oakleigh&quot;. It did not receive its current name until 1954. Huntingdale is a ground-level host station, consisting of a single island platform connected to both Railway Avenue and Haughton Road via a pedestrian subway.

Huntingdale station is currently served by the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. Additionally the station is served by five bus routes including the 601 university shuttle and SmartBus route 900. The station is approximately or around a 30-minute train ride away from Flinders Street.

== Description ==
Huntingdale railway station is located on the border of the suburbs of Oakleigh and Huntingdale. On the north-eastern side of the station is Railway Avenue and Haughton Road is to the south-west. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. The station is approximately or around a 30-minute train ride away from Flinders Street.

Huntingdale station consists of a single island platform connected to both Railway Avenue and Haughton Road via a pedestrian subway. The length of the platform is approximately , long enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. There is a single station building which primarily serves as a waiting room.

The main car park at the station is located on Railway Avenue just north-east of the station. Although there are ramps they do not fully comply with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 as the gradient of the ramps is steeper than the maximum of 1:14 allowed under the Act.

== History ==
Huntingdale station opened on 25 June 1927, like the suburb itself, gets its name from the Melbourne Hunt Club, which occupied parts of the suburb (then known as Oakleigh East) from 1887 to 1929. The land that was occupied by the Hunt Club was later acquired by the Eastern Golf Club which subsequently became the Huntingdale Golf Club in 1940. The station received its current name in 1954 when &quot;Huntingdale&quot; became the accepted named for the former suburb of East Oakleigh.

In 1970, the signal box and interlocked gates at the station were removed, as part of the grade separation of the North Road level crossing. During this time a temporary level crossing was provided with boom barriers whilst construction was undertaken and, in that year, the current station building and underpass were provided. In 1971, the island platform was extended at the south-eastern end.

In March 2011, there was a significant amount of garbage dumped at the station car park. Metro Trains Melbourne cleaned of rubbish on 18 March 2011, at a cost of around $7,000. A survey of commuters in August 2011 rated Huntingdale among the worst stations in Melbourne because of rubbish and graffiti at the station, unsafe access and flooding of the subway.

In 2013, there was a lobbying campaign by Monash University, Clayton campus seeking improvements to Huntingdale station and the bus interchange. Connecting bus services were often far away from the station with bus stops having no lighting or shelters available. The condition of the station and bus interchange was a serious concern for Clayton campus, because Huntingdale station is a major gateway to the university through bus route 601. In 2015 the decision to construct a $5 million bus interchange was announced by the Andrews Government which was expected address these concerns.

In 2018, the station received a $11.6 million upgrade which turned the station into a transport hub. The main project during this upgrade was the construction of a new bus interchange which cost $5 million. The existing car park was also upgraded with additional parking installed. In 2015, the project was said to cost $7.6 million which is about $4 million less than the project&#x27;s final cost.

== Platforms and services ==
The station is currently served by both the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines which are both operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Services to East Pakenham and Cranbourne travel together south-east towards Dandenong before splitting into two separate lines. Services to the city run express from Caulfield (Malvern during off-peak) to South Yarra before stopping all stations to Flinders Street via the City Loop.

Platform 1:
* express services to Flinders Street

== History ==
Clayton station opened just over two years after the line from Oakleigh was extended to Dandenong. The station was originally called Clayton&#x27;s Road, receiving its current name in 1890. The station, like the suburb itself, gets its name from the property &quot;Clayton Vale&quot;, owned by John Clayton in the 1860s and 1870s, which was located near the station.

Two timber station buildings, now heritage listed, were constructed in 1891, with one on each platform. What sets the buildings apart was their modular design, which included a booking office, a general waiting area and a ladies waiting room. When the elevated new station was being constructed, the old station building on platform 2 was relocated and protected due to its historical status. It now contains an archival photographic record of the station.

In 1971, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Clayton Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In 1998, Clayton was upgraded to a premium station and staffed from early in the morning until the last train. 

=== Level crossing removal ===
In March 2014, the Victorian state government announced a grade separation project to replace the Clayton Road level crossing, as well as the Centre Road level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station. That necessitated the rebuilding of the station. 

In 2016, the Andrews government announced that, as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP), of elevated rail would be provided, removing nine level crossings on the Pakenham and Cranbourne rail corridor, including the building of five new elevated stations at Carnegie, Murrumbeena, Hughesdale, Noble Park and Clayton.

Dubbed &quot;sky rail&quot; by opponents and some media outlets, the plans for an elevated railway spurred significant local opposition due to concerns over visual and noise impacts. The project became a political issue in the 2018 state election.

In April 2018, the new, elevated Clayton station was opened, along with the four other elevated stations on the Caulfield to Dandenong line. The removals created a large new section of open parkland, dubbed a &quot;linear park&quot;. This included of new open space, sports courts, playgrounds, new walking and cycling trails, and expanded station forecourts. As part of the project, the Djerring Trail was created, a shared-use path along the rail corridor, which runs through the Clayton station precinct. In the year after the elevated rail opened in 2018, the media reported that many residents, including some who were opposed to the project, were happy with the outcome and utilised the new open space.

== Platforms and services ==
Clayton is an elevated premium station, consisting of an island platform connected to the station concourse on Clayton Road via escalators, lifts and a staircase.
The station is served by both Pakenham and Cranbourne trains, and is also served by V/Line trains on the Gippsland line.

Services to East Pakenham and Cranbourne travel together south-east towards Dandenong before splitting into two separate lines. Services to the city run express from Caulfield (Malvern during off-peak) to South Yarra, before stopping all stations to Flinders Street via the City Loop. Traralgon and Bairnsdale services run express to Nar Nar Goon, stopping at Dandenong and Pakenham, before stopping all stations after Nar Nar Goon. From Clayton regional services to the city run express to Richmond, stopping at Caulfield, before stopping all stations to Southern Cross.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (drop off only)

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to East Pakenham
* all stations services to Cranbourne
* V/Line services to Traralgon (pick up only), Sale (one Sunday morning service, pick up only) and Bairnsdale (one weekday service, pick up only)

Future services:
In addition to the current services, there are also two proposed services. From 2025, the under-construction Metro Tunnel will link the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines with the Sunbury line. If the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link is built, services will additionally run to Melbourne Airport.
* express services to Sunbury (2025 onwards)
* express services to Melbourne Airport (2033 onwards)

== Transport links ==
Clayton is served by eight bus routes, including SmartBus route 703. Routes 704, 821, 824, 978, 979 and northbound services on routes 631, 703 and 733 depart from the interchange on Carinish Road, whereas southbound services on route 631, 703 and 733 depart from the bus stop on Clayton Road.

=== Carinish Road ===
* : to Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre
* SmartBus : to Blackburn station
* : Oakleigh station – Westall station
* : to Box Hill station
* : to Westfield Southland
* : Moorabbin station – Parkmore Shopping Centre
* Night Bus : to Dandenong station (via Mulgrave) (Saturday and Sunday mornings only)
* Night Bus : to Dandenong station (via Keysborough) (Saturday and Sunday mornings only)

* : to Westfield Southland
* SmartBus : to Middle Brighton station
* : to Oakleigh station

=== Suburban Rail Loop ===

In 2018, Clayton station has been chosen as one of the stations to be served by the proposed Suburban Rail Loop. As part of the project, the station will receive a major upgrade, which will involve construction of two new underground platforms, as well as the conversion of the station to a transport superhub. In June 2022, construction began just south of the existing station. Tunnelling is set to begin in 2026, and the eastern section of the SRL (SRL East) is planned to open in 2035. A direct paid-area connection between the new underground station and elevated platforms is planned to be built between the elevated rail tracks.
* services to Southland and Box Hill

<text>Westall railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Clayton South, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Westall station is a ground-level premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 6 February 1951, with the current station provided in 2010.

==History==
Opening on 6 February 1951, Westall station originally comprised two workers-only platforms for staff at the adjacent Martin &amp; King railway coach-building factory. On 1 June 1959, the station became available to the general public, and all services began stopping there. The station, like the locality itself, gets its name from an early market garden proprietor who lived in the area.

On 19 July 1975, the former timber station building on Platform 1 was damaged by fire. In 1985, boom barriers were provided at the former Westall Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station.

The station had a stabling yard located at its southern end, as well as a number of industrial sidings serving nearby factories. On 17 April 1998, the Westall train maintenance centre was officially opened in the former goods yard, as part of the decentralisation of train stabling and maintenance from the former Jolimont Yards. The buildings were approximately 2,850 m2 in size, and permitted bogie repair and replacement, under-carriage and overhead work. The facility cost $15 million, which also included the Bayswater facility.

In 2000, the Westall Road level crossing was grade separated, and replaced with a road overpass. By 4 February 2001, the boom barriers at the former level crossing were decommissioned.

On 26 July 2006, a fire in the waiting room on Platform 1 caused major damage to half the station building, the ticket machines, seats and a section of the platform. The city-bound platform was closed off and passenger services to Flinders Street operated express from Springvale to Clayton, bypassing Westall, until temporary fencing was placed around the building. The damaged section was subsequently demolished and rebuilt.

In May 2008, the Victorian State Government announced that the Westall station precinct would receive a $151 million upgrade, which included a rebuilt station, a new third platform, a third 2.6-kilometre track between Centre Road and Springvale Road and additional storage space at the Westall stabling yard. Work commenced in January 2010, with the majority of the works completed by October of that year. Following these works, Westall was upgraded to a Premium Station.

== Platforms and services ==
Westall has one side platform (Platform 1) and one island platform with two faces (Platforms 2 and 3), linked by a footbridge. Access to the platforms is via stairs and lifts. The side platform features a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room and toilets, while the island platform features an enclosed waiting room. A number of services terminate at Westall and return to the city.

It is served by Pakenham and Cranbourne line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations services to East Pakenham
* all stations services to Cranbourne

Platform 3:
* all stations services to East Pakenham
* all stations services to Cranbourne

Future services:&lt;br&gt;
In addition to the current services, the Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposes linking the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines to both the Sunbury line and under-construction Melbourne Airport rail link via the Metro Tunnel.
* express services to West Footscray and Sunbury (2025 onwards)
* express services to Melbourne Airport (2033 onwards)

<text>Springvale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Springvale, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Springvale station is a below ground premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 September 1880, with the current station provided in 2014.

Initially opened as Spring Vale, the station was given its current name of Springvale on 29 February 1972.

==History==

Springvale station opened on 1 September 1880, almost three years after the railway line from Oakleigh was extended to Dandenong. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the &quot;Spring Vale Hotel&quot;, the proprietor inspired by the natural springs in the area for travellers and stock between Melbourne and Dandenong. The name was also inspired by a place near the Bog of Allen in the proprietor&#x27;s native Ireland.

In 1964, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Springvale Road level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

In 1975, the signal box was provided with a new relay interlocking system. Also occurring in that year, a crossover was abolished at the up end of the station, with a new crossover provided at the down end. In 1976, the goods platform was abolished.

On 7 June 1996, Springvale was upgraded to a premium station.

The remnant of a former branch line, which operated to Spring Vale Cemetery station, was located at the down end of the station. In 1922, it was provided with overhead wiring. In 1952, the majority of the line was dismantled, with the remaining portion of the line becoming a siding. In October 2002, it was booked out of use and, in August 2008, the associated points and signals, the crossover and overhead wiring were removed.

On 30 January 2012, the signal box was abolished, with control transferred to the Dandenong signal box. In mid-2013, construction commenced on a grade separation project to eliminate the Springvale Road level crossing, immediately adjacent to the station. As part of this project, a new station was constructed below street level, which opened on 22 April 2014.

== Platforms, facilities and services ==

Springvale has two side platforms, with a concourse above on ground level. The concourse features a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room and toilets. Inside this enclosed waiting room there is a small coffee kiosk. Access to the platforms is provided by stairs and ramps.

<text>Sandown Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Springvale, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Sandown Park station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened 19 June 1965.

==History==
===1889-1955===
Sandown Park originally opened on 12 August 1889 as Oakleigh Racecourse. It was renamed Sandown Park in 1892. Named after Sandown Park in Surrey, England, the station was built to service the nearby Sandown Racecourse, and was only used for racecourse traffic.

Upon opening, the station did not feature in any timetables for the Eastern line. By 1892, it was featured in timetables for the first time.

By 1909, in addition to the two main lines, there was a signal box and booking office located at the up end of the station, and two sidings each over 600 metres long on the eastern side of the tracks, for the stabling of special race services. The station had no platform on the up track, instead having an island platform on the down track, with the other face serving one of the sidings on the eastern side.

By 1929, four sidings existed at the down end of the station, parallel to the main lines. In 1937, a crossover at the down end of the station was abolished and, in 1943, three sidings that adjoined the back platform road were abolished. By 1954, the back platform road and the remaining siding were placed out of use. On 16 May 1955, Sandown Park was closed.

===1965-present===
On 19 June 1965, Sandown Park reopened as an island platform, coinciding with the first race day meeting at the adjacent racecourse. Like the first station, it was open for passengers on race days only. On October 4 of that year, it was opened for general passenger traffic.

The station once had a second exit and a pedestrian underpass at the up end of the platform, but that has since been closed and filled in.

Nearby, towards Noble Park, the Corrigan Road level crossing was removed in 2018, as part of the Victorian Government&#x27;s Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP).

== Platforms and services ==

Sandown Park has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Cranbourne and Pakenham line services.

<text>Noble Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Noble Park, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Noble Park station is an elevated premium station, with an island platform. It opened on 3 February 1913, with the current station provided in 2018.

==History==
Noble Park station, like the suburb itself, is named after Noble Buckley, the son of Allan Buckley, who is recognised as the founder of the suburb.

In 1927, the station was closed to goods traffic. In 1954, flashing light signals were provided at the former Heatherton Road level crossing, which was located near the station in the up direction.

In 1972, new ground-level station buildings were provided, after the original station building on Platform 1 had been destroyed by an arsonist on 22 August 1970. In 1977, boom barriers were provided at the former Heatherton Road level crossing.

In 2007, minor upgrade works were carried out to the station as part of the EastLink toll road project. The upgrades including improved shelter, car parking and better security, including brighter lighting and better CCTV coverage.

In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced the grade separation of the Heatherton Road level crossing, with construction beginning in 2016. The final scheme involved elevating the line over Corrigan, Heatherton and Chandler Roads and included a new high-level station, which opened on 15 February 2018. A row of shops now occupies the site of the former ground-level station buildings.

<text>Yarraman railway station is a commuter railway station located in the suburbs of Noble Park and Dandenong, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station was named after the nearby Yarraman Creek, a first-order tributary of the lower Dandenong Creek/Patterson River system. Yarraman is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 21 December 1976.

The station is currently served by the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station is located about from the Melbourne CBD.

The EastLink toll road is located near the down (south-eastern) end of the station, crossing the line via an overpass. The EastLink Trail, which follows the tollway, uses the entrance footbridge of the station to traverse the railway.

== History ==

Yarraman station opened on 21 December 1976. To allow its construction, the existing up track was slewed in 1974. At that time, an alternative name for the station, &quot;Fotheringham&quot;, was suggested, to recognise a notable local family.

In 2015, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced the grade separation of the nearby Chandler Road level crossing. Construction began in 2016, with the level crossing removed and a railway overpass built over the road by 2018. Unlike many stations between Noble Park and Caulfield, that were elevated on viaducts as part of the level crossing removal project, the tracks between Dandenong and Noble Park largely remained at ground level. Yarraman station was not rebuilt because it is over 500 metres away from the Chandler Road viaduct.

== Platforms and services ==
Yarraman station has one island platform with two faces, accessible only via a ramped elevated footbridge at its south-eastern end. It is served by Cranbourne and Pakenham line trains. The Department of Transport plans to connect the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines to the Sunbury line in 2025, using the new Metro Tunnel.

During peak hours, limited express services towards Flinders Street, Cranbourne and Pakenham often skip the station. V/Line services on the Traralgon and Bairnsdale line do not stop at the station.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Cranbourne
* all stations services to East Pakenham

=== Future services ===
In addition to the current services, the PTV Network Development Plan proposes linking the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines to both the Sunbury line and Melbourne Airport rail link via the Metro Tunnel.
* express services to West Footscray and Sunbury (2025 onwards)
* express services to Melbourne Airport (2029 onwards)

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates two routes via Yarraman station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Dandenong station – Brighton
* : Dandenong station – Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre

<text>Dandenong railway station is a commuter, regional railway station and the junction point of the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, which are both part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Dandenong, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Dandenong station is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces and one side platform. It opened on 8 October 1877, with the current station provided in 1995.

A number of train stabling sidings are located near the station, including to the north of the station on either side of the railway line, as well as parallel to the platforms. A little-used goods yard was once located to the south of the station.

The disused General Motors station was situated between Dandenong and Hallam.

==History==
Dandenong opened as one of the original stations on the Melbourne to Sale railway line. In 1892, the South Gippsland line opened from Dandenong. Like the suburb itself, the station name derives either from an Indigenous word believed to mean &quot;lofty mountains&quot;, or the Woiwurrung word &quot;Tanjenong&quot;, which was the name of a local creek.

In 1922, the line from Oakleigh to Dandenong was electrified. In 1954, electrification was extended to Warragul, then onwards to Traralgon. Trains beyond Dandenong were generally hauled by L class electric locomotives, and were principally used for passenger services and briquette traffic, using coal from the large open cut coal mines in the Latrobe Valley. In 1956, the line was duplicated to Narre Warren.

In 1972, the down end of Platform 1 was extended. On 19 January 1975, electrified suburban services were extended to Pakenham. Occurring in that year, the station buildings were reconstructed.

During 1994-1995, the station was again rebuilt, as part of the Cranbourne electrification project. The rebuild included the demolition of the former Southern Aurora Hotel (completed in May 1993), the removal of the former timber station building (completed in April 1994), and filling-in the pedestrian underpass at the down end of the station. On 24 March 1995, the rebuilt station was opened by the then Prime Minister Paul Keating.

During the 2017/2018 financial year, Dandenong was the twelfth-busiest station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with almost 2.2 million passenger movements.

== Facilities, platforms and services ==
Dandenong has one side platform and one island platform with two faces. Access to the platforms is provided by stairs and lifts from an overhead concourse. The side platform (Platform 3) has a kiosk and an enclosed waiting room, containing a customer service window and toilets.

Dandenong is served by Cranbourne and Pakenham line trains, and by V/Line Traralgon and Bairnsdale trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* V/Line services to Southern Cross (set-down only)

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Cranbourne
* all stations services to East Pakenham
* V/Line services to Traralgon and Bairnsdale (pick-up only)

Up until mid-late 2019, the unique configuration of the tracks at both ends of the station allowed trains to depart from any platform, in any direction. Since then, Pakenham bound services can no longer depart from Platform 1.

Future services:&lt;br&gt;
In addition to the current services, the PTV Network Development Plan proposes linking the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines to both the Sunbury line and the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link via the Metro Tunnel.
* express services to West Footscray and Sunbury (2025 onwards)
* express services to Melbourne Airport (2029 onwards)

<text>An aire urbaine (literal and official translation: &quot;urban area&quot;) is an INSEE (France&#x27;s national statistics bureau) statistical concept describing a core of urban development and the extent of its commuter activity. It was replaced by the concept &quot;functional area&quot; (), which uses the same definition as Eurostat&#x27;s functional urban areas, in 2020.

==Definition==
The &quot;aire urbaine&quot; is built from France&#x27;s nationwide interlocking administrative &quot;commune&quot; municipalities: when a &quot;commune&quot; has over 2000 inhabitants and contains a centre of dense construction (buildings spaced no more than 200 metres apart), it is combined with other adjoining communes fulfilling the same criteria to become a single &quot;unité urbaine&quot; (&quot;urban unit&quot;); if an urban unit offers over 10,000 jobs and its economical development is enough to draw more than 40% of the population of a nearby municipalities (and other municipalities drawn to these in the same way) as commuters, it becomes a &quot;pôle urbain&quot; (&quot;urban cluster&quot;) and the &quot;commuter municipalities&quot; become its &quot;couronne&quot; (&quot;rim&quot;), but this only on the condition that the urban unit itself is not part of another urban cluster&#x27;s rim. The &quot;aire urbaine&quot; is an urban cluster and its rim combined, or a statistical area describing a central urban core and its economic influence on surrounding municipalities.

===Types of &quot;aires urbaines&quot;===
As of 2010, depending on their population and function, &quot;aires urbaines&quot; adopt the following secondary appellations:
* &quot;aires urbaines&quot; with more than 500,000 inhabitants and 20,000 official &#x27;metropolitan-type jobs&#x27; are considered &quot;aires métropolitaines&quot; (&#x27;metropolitan areas&#x27;)
* &quot;aires urbaines&quot; with more than 200,000 inhabitants are considered &quot;grandes aires&quot; (&#x27;large urban areas&#x27;)
* &quot;aires urbaines&quot; centred around a &#x27;pole&#x27; urban unit with 5,000 to 10,000 jobs (with at least 40% of the surrounding commune populations working there) are &#x27;moyennes aires&#x27; (&#x27;medium urban areas&#x27;).
* &quot;aires urbaines&quot; centred around a &#x27;pole&#x27; urban unit with 1,500 to 5,000 jobs (with at least 40% of the surrounding commune populations working there) are &#x27;petites aires&#x27; (&#x27;small urban areas&#x27;).

== History ==
In France, multiple words exist to define various kinds of urban area.

One of the first words used was the word &quot;agglomération&quot;, which was first used to deal with a group of people.
The word was used, for instance, in a law from 5 April 1884 (&quot;loi du 5 avril 1884&quot;), in which Article 98 gives the mayor police power (&quot;pouvoirs de police&quot;), meaning authority over the city, but only within the &quot;agglomération&quot;.
That law was used as a legal precedent in 1907 to forbid a mayor from setting a speed limit on the road next to a farm, considering that at that time, a group of houses inside a farm might be an &quot;agglomération&quot;, but the road next to it was not inside the &quot;agglomération&quot;.

Later, in the 1920s, the concept of &quot;agglomération&quot; was used in the &quot;code de la route&quot; (Highway code) to define specific law within or outside of such a zone.

In 1968, the French word &quot;agglomération&quot; was introduced in the French version of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in the place where the English word &quot;built-up area&quot; was used in the English version of the same treaty. In this treaty, the word is only defined as a concept signalled by an entry sign and an exit sign, while still allowing members of the treaty to have different definitions.

Nowadays, words with an English origin or meaning tend to be introduced into the French language as loanwords, in order to describe new concepts, words or meanings, or to replace old words. Such words include: &quot;aire urbaine&quot; (urban area); &quot;métropole&quot; (metropolis); &quot;agglomération&quot; (agglomeration); &quot;communauté urbaine&quot; (urban community); &quot;Grand&quot; + the name of a city (Grand Paris, Grand Toulouse).

As a member of the European Union and the OECD, for statistical purposes, France may need to consider the regions inside or outside of the limits of an urban area.

==List of France&#x27;s &quot;aires urbaines&quot; (metropolitan areas)==
The following is a list of the twenty largest &quot;aires urbaines&quot; (metropolitan areas) in France, based on their population at the 2016 census. Population at the 2011 and 2006 census is indicated for comparison.

In both time intervals presented in the table below (2006 to 2011 and 2011 to 2016), the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in France were Bordeaux, Montpellier, Toulouse, Nantes, Rennes and Lyon with an average annual growth rate equal or greater than 1%.

<text>Hallam railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Hallam, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Hallam station is an elevated premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 December 1880, with the current station provided in 2022.

Initially opened as Hallam&#x27;s Road, the station was given its current name of Hallam on 2 May 1904.

Disused station General Motors is located between Hallam and Dandenong.

==History==

Hallam station opened on 1 December 1880 as a single platform, just over three years after the railway line from Dandenong was extended to Pakenham. The station gets its name from Hallam&#x27;s Road, itself named after William Hallam, who settled in the area in 1856 and operated a general store and hotel on the present day corner of the Princes Highway and Hallam Road.

In 1954, a goods siding at the station was closed. Between 1955 and 1956, the former ground level platforms were provided, when the line between Dandenong and Narre Warren was duplicated.

In 1959, flashing light signals replaced hand gates at the former Hallam South Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station, with boom barriers provided in 1985. On 16 July 1990, the station officially operated for passenger business only.

Sometime during or after 1995, the former ground level station shelters were provided.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Hallam to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

In 2014, it was announced that the Hallam South Road level crossing would be grade separated by the Andrews government, as originally promised by the Labor government in the 2014 Victorian state election. On 13 July 2020, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced the designs for the new, rebuilt elevated station. In January 2021, major construction works started to remove the level crossing.

On 18 March 2022, Hallam South Road level crossing and equipment were eliminated and was replaced by the elevated rail bridge over the road, which the trains started running through on 22 March 2022. On 2 April 2022, Hallam South Road reopened to traffic after being closed for fourteen days due to the removal works, resurfacing and installation of a new signalised intersection at the corner of the stations&#x27; northern car park and Hallam South Road. On 2 May 2022, the rebuilt station opened to passengers.

== Platforms and services ==

Hallam has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Pakenham line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to East Pakenham

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Pakenham line will be through-routed with those on the Sunbury line, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<doc id="707928" wikidata="Q727164" url="?curid=707928" title="IAAF Golden League">
<text>The IAAF Golden League was an annual series of outdoor track and field meetings organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Athletes who won specific events at all of the series meetings were awarded a jackpot prize, sometimes given in gold bars, which inspired the series name. The competition began with seven meetings and it lasted for twelve years as the IAAF&#x27;s top tier of one-day meetings. Within the IAAF&#x27;s global circuit, athletes received additional points for their performances at the Golden League for the IAAF Grand Prix (1998–2002), IAAF World Outdoor Meetings (2003–2005), then IAAF World Athletics Tour (2006–2009). The Golden League was replaced in 2010 by the Diamond League, which marked an expansion to fourteen seasonal meetings covering all track and field events except the hammer throw.The origins of the Golden League trace back to the Golden Four series that ran from 1993 to 1997, comprising four top level European meetings on the IAAF Grand Prix circuit (Berlin, Brussels, Oslo, and Zürich). The first Golden League was held as the new top tier of the 1998 IAAF Grand Prix and consisted of the former Golden Four meetings, plus Rome, Monaco, and the 1998 IAAF Grand Prix Final in Moscow. From the 1999 IAAF Golden League onwards, the Meeting Gaz de France in Paris was added and the Grand Prix Final dropped. That year all meetings were scheduled for Wednesday evenings in order to improve the sport&#x27;s television coverage. When the IAAF Grand Prix was succeeded by the IAAF World Outdoor Meetings series in 2003, the Monaco meeting was removed from the Golden League series and made host of the IAAF World Athletics Final instead. The Golden League meetings remained unchanged from 2003 to 2009.

The series had three title sponsors in its history, starting with Ericsson in 1998, TDK in 2004 and 2005, then ÅF in 2008 and 2009.

==Editions==

==Meetings==

*In 2004, the Bislett Games were moved from Oslo to the Fana Stadion in Bergen due to the redevelopment of the Bislett Stadium. The renovation was a requirement to its maintaining Golden League status.

==Jackpot==
===Rules===
The jackpot and its eligibility rules changed through the competition&#x27;s history. Each year, a number of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events were made eligible for the Golden League jackpot if an athlete won their event at all Golden League meetings. This ranged from five to eight men&#x27;s events and five to six women&#x27;s events for each year. In the first two years, jackpot winners shared in a US$1 million prize. In 2000 and 2001, this was changed to 50 kg of gold bars and athletes only had to win at 5 out of 7 meetings to qualify for the jackpot. In 2003, the prize structure reverted to US$1 million for athletes winning at all the meets only, and a new stipulation was that athletes also had to compete at the IAAF World Athletics Final. 

From 2006 onwards, the jackpot events were set to five men&#x27;s events and five women&#x27;s events, ensuring gender equality. The award structure was also changed in 2006 so that athletes who won any five of the six events shared in a purse of US$250,000, while the remaining US$750,000 would be divided among athletes who won all six meetings. This was to a response to the fact that only four athletes shared in the jackpot in the three previous seasons. From 2007 onwards, the jackpot was again only shared amongst athletes who won at all six meetings.
===Events===



===Winners===

*The 2006 series had a split prize pot, with US$250,000 shared between the athletes who won at five meetings, and US$750,000 being shared among athletes who won at all six meetings.

<text>Narre Warren railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Narre Warren, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Narre Warren station is an elevated hybrid premium station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 10 March 1882, with the current station provided in 2024.

==History==
Narre Warren station opened on 10 March 1882 as a single platform, just over four years after the railway line from Dandenong was extended to Pakenham. Like the suburb itself, the station carries the name of an Aboriginal word believed to mean &#x27;small hills&#x27;.

In 1956, the line between Dandenong and Narre Warren was duplicated, with duplication to Berwick provided in 1962. As part of the duplication to Berwick, an island platform was provided, as well as boom barriers replacing interlocked gates at the former Webb Street level crossing which, at the time, was located at the down end of the station.

In 1970, a crossover between No. 2 and No.3 roads was abolished. In 1974, flashing light signals were provided at the former Cranbourne Road level crossing, which was located nearby in the down direction of the station. In 1978, the waiting room at the original station was demolished.

In 1986, boom barriers were provided at the Cranbourne Road level crossing. By 1988, No. 2 road was booked out of use, as well as points at each end of the road and a crossover at the up end of the station. In 1989, the signal box was abolished.

On 2 June 1995, the station was relocated to the east side of the Webb Street level crossing, and reopened to the public the following day.

In October 2003, Narre Warren was upgraded to a premium station. In 2004, the Cranbourne Road level crossing was grade separated, being replaced with a road underpass.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Webb Street level crossing would be grade separated by 2025, with a rail over road &quot;hybrid&quot; design. Webb Street was to be lowered and a rail bridge built over the road, with the station to be rebuilt as part of those works. However, on 14 January 2022, the LXRP announced that the &quot;hybrid&quot; design would be replaced with a rail over road design, removing the need to lower Webb Street. On 23 August of that year, final designs for the level crossing removal and rebuilt station were released. 

On 24 November 2023, a &#x27;construction blitz&#x27; began, which saw the station close and demolished, while trains stopped running on sections of the Pakenham line. On 10 December of that year, the construction blitz ended, with trains on the Pakenham line resuming the following day, operating on the rail-over-road bridge without stopping at Narre Warren. Services resumed stopping at the station as it reopened on 28 March 2024.

== Platforms, facilities and services ==
Narre Warren has two side platforms. It is located on top of Webb Street, which also provided station access. The 2003 station featured a semi-large fibro building was located at the Flinders Street (Up) end of the station, which housed an enclosed waiting area, toilets and ticket facilities. There was a myki ticket vending machine inside the waiting area. There was also a small café located next to the entrance of the building, which was open during the morning peak-hour, selling coffee and newspapers. A Protective Service Officers&#x27; (PSO) pod was located next to the station building, which was used from 6:00 pm until the last service every day.

Narre Warren is served by Pakenham line trains. On average, there are three off-peak services per hour on weekdays, travelling to and from Flinders Street, with more frequent services during peak-hours, and three services an hour on weekends.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to East Pakenham

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Pakenham line will be through-routed with those on the Sunbury line, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Barbara Eden (born Barbara Jean Morehead; August 23, 1931) is an American actress and singer, who starred as the title character in the sitcom &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1965–1970). Her other roles included Roslyn Pierce opposite Elvis Presley in &quot;Flaming Star&quot; (1960), Lieutenant (JG) Cathy Connors in &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961), and a single widowed mother, Stella Johnson, in the comedy film &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; (1978) and in the television series of the same name.

Eden began singing in bands as a teenager and studied singing and acting. In 1955, she began her television career with appearances on &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot; and on various other series, such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. By 1957, she was starring in the comedy TV series &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;. She also began to act in plays. In 1959, she had her first major film role in &quot;A Private&#x27;s Affair&quot;. After &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, Eden appeared mostly in dramatic roles, such as in the TV movie &quot;&quot; (1977). She also appeared in musical comedy tours, other theatrical roles and a TV broadcast of &quot;Kismet&quot;, released an album, appeared on variety television shows and USO shows, and headlined Las Vegas acts. After starring in the film and TV series &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, she played opposite her &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; co-star Larry Hagman on several occasions, including in five episodes of the final season of &quot;Dallas&quot; and the play &quot;Love Letters&quot;. Eden continued to perform until the age of 90.

==Early years==
Eden was born on August 23, 1931, in Tucson, Arizona, to Alice Mary (née Franklin) and Hubert Henry Morehead. She is a descendant of Benjamin Franklin. For decades, her year of birth was thought to be 1934. After her parents&#x27; divorce, she and her mother moved to San Francisco, where her mother married Harrison Connor Huffman, a telephone lineman, by whom she had a daughter, Eden&#x27;s half-sister. Eden grew up in San Francisco&#x27;s Parkside neighborhood, and traces her family back four generations in San Francisco, remembering stories about her grandmother who came in a covered wagon and her grandfather who came on a clipper ship.

The Great Depression deeply affected the family, and as they were unable to afford many luxuries, Alice entertained her children with singing. Eden remembers having a &quot;very musical family&quot;.

Eden&#x27;s first public performance was singing in the church choir, where she sang the solos. As a teenager, she sang in local bands led by Howard Fredericks and Freddie Martin.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfchronicle/eden-sf-com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, she studied singing with voice teacher Paulina Giovanini at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and acting with the Elizabeth Holloway School of Theatre. She graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco in the Spring Class of 1949 and studied theater for one year at City College of San Francisco. As Barbara Huffman, she was elected Miss San Francisco in 1951 and she also entered the Miss California pageant.

==Television and film roles==
Eden began her television career as a semiregular on &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot; in 1955. She also made featured appearances on shows such as &quot;The West Point Story&quot;, &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, &quot;Private Secretary&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;December Bride&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;, &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot;, &quot;The Rogues&quot;, and the series finale of &quot;Route 66&quot;. She guest-starred in four episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, playing different roles each time. She was an uncredited extra in the movie &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; with Rock Hudson, in partnership with 20th Century Fox studios. She then starred in the syndicated comedy TV series &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;. The series is based on the 1953 film of the same name.

Film director Mark Robson, who later directed Eden in the movie &quot;From the Terrace&quot;, took note of Eden&#x27;s performance in a play with James Drury and wanted her to work for 20th Century Fox studios. Her screen test was the Joanne Woodward role in &quot;No Down Payment&quot; (1957). Although she did not get the role, the studio gave Eden a contract. She did a screen test for the role of Betty Anderson in the 1957 film version of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, but Terry Moore got the role. She had minor roles in &quot;Bailout at 43,000&quot;, &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, and &quot;The Wayward Girl&quot;, then became a leading lady in films, starring opposite Gary Crosby, Barry Coe, and Sal Mineo in &quot;A Private&#x27;s Affair&quot;. She had a co-starring role in &quot;Flaming Star&quot; (1960), with Elvis Presley.

The following year, she played in a supporting role as Lt. Cathy Connors in Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. She starred in &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot;, a Cinerama film directed by George Pal for MGM, and another Irwin Allen production for 20th Century Fox, &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (1962). She was the female lead in the 1962 Fox comedy &quot;Swingin&#x27; Along&quot;, starring Tommy Noonan and Peter Marshall, in their final joint screen appearance. She did a screen test with Andy Williams for the 20th Century Fox movie &quot;State Fair&quot;, but did not get the role.

Her last film for 20th Century Fox was &quot;The Yellow Canary&quot; (1963). She left Fox and began guest-starring in television shows and acting in films for MGM, Universal, and Columbia. She played supporting roles over the next few years, including &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; and &quot;7 Faces of Dr. Lao&quot;.

===&quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;===

In 1965, producer Sidney Sheldon signed Eden to star in his upcoming fantasy sitcom &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; for NBC. After various brunette starlets and beauty queens unsuccessfully tried out for the role, Eden was approached by Sheldon, who had seen her in &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; and had received numerous recommendations for Eden from various colleagues. Eden played Jeannie, a beautiful genie set free from her bottle by astronaut and United States Air Force Captain (later Major) Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Nelson, played by Larry Hagman.

Eden played this role for five years and 139 episodes.

==Musicals and 1970s TV movies==
Eden starred in such musical comedies as &quot;Nite Club Confidential&quot; (playing the role of Kay Goodman, in 1996), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot; with Robert Goulet, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; with John Raitt, and &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; playing Lorelei Lee. She played Lalune in a TV adaptation of &quot;Kismet&quot; (1967). From April through September 1984, she starred in the national production of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, playing the role of Tess Harding Craig. She has been a musical guest star in many variety television shows, including 21 Bob Hope specials, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;, &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot;, &quot;This Is Tom Jones&quot;, &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;, and &quot;Donny and Marie&quot;. She released an album titled &quot;Miss Barbara Eden&quot; in 1967 on Dot Records. She also had long-running stints headlining in Las Vegas.
After &quot;Jeannie&quot;, Eden starred in an unaired pilot, &quot;The Barbara Eden Show&quot;, and another pilot, &quot;The Toy Game&quot;. Her first TV movie was called &quot;The Feminist and the Fuzz&quot; (1971). Although she is best known for comedy, most of these films were dramas, as when she starred opposite her &quot;Jeannie&quot; co-star Larry Hagman in &quot;A Howling in the Woods&quot; (1971). In &quot;The Stranger Within&quot; (1974), Eden played housewife Ann Collins, a woman impregnated by extraterrestrials. Later, Eden played a policewoman-turned-private detective investigating the disappearance of a missing heiress, in the critically acclaimed TV movie &quot;&quot; (1977). She starred in and co-produced, with her own production company (MI-Bar Productions), the NBC-TV romantic comedy movie &quot;The Secret Life of Kathy McCormick&quot; (1988). She also starred in and produced the romantic comedy TV movie &quot;Opposites Attract&quot; (1990), co-starring John Forsythe.

==&quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot; and later career==
In 1978, she starred in the feature film &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;, based on the popular country song. This led to a namesake television series in 1981. In both the movie and the TV series, Eden played the protagonist Stella Johnson. It was a comedy version of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, with Anne Francine playing wealthy villainess Flora Simpson Reilly. In one episode, Stella dressed in a blue and gold genie costume, and in another, she played both Stella and her cousin Della Smith (similar to Jeannie&#x27;s evil twin-sister character). It debuted January 16, 1981, winning 11 of its 13 time slots during the first season. It was renamed simply &quot;Harper Valley&quot; when it began its second season on October 29, 1981. During this time, Eden also became the spokeswoman for L&#x27;eggs pantyhose, and appeared in a series of print advertisements and TV commercials for the brand from 1979 to 1983.
In 1990, Eden played a recurring role as a billionairess seeking revenge against J.R. Ewing in five episodes of the final season of &quot;Dallas&quot;, as the captivating character LeeAnn de la Vega, reuniting her with Hagman. In her final episode, the character admits that her maiden name is Nelson (a production gag, as &quot;Nelson&quot; was the surname of Hagman&#x27;s character and Eden&#x27;s character&#x27;s married name in &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;). In 1991, she starred in the stage play &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; with Wayne Rogers, and reprised her role of Jeannie in a television movie-of-the-week. In 1993, she starred in an 11-city national tour of the play &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; with Don Knotts.

From 2000 to 2004, she starred in the national touring production of the play &quot;The Odd Couple: The Female Version&quot; playing the role of Florence Unger opposite Rita MacKenzie as Olive Madison. In March 2006, Eden reunited with her former co-star Larry Hagman for a publicity tour in New York City to promote the first-season DVD of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. They appeared together on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Martha&quot;, and &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;, among other shows.

In March 2006, Hagman and Eden again reunited, this time onstage in New York for &quot;Love Letters&quot; at the College of Staten Island, and at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. This was Eden&#x27;s first return visit to the academy since appearing in the 1956 Ziv Television Programs, &quot;The West Point Story.&quot; Eden also starred in &quot;Love Letters&quot; opposite Hal Linden the same year and had a guest-starring role on the Lifetime series &quot;Army Wives&quot;. She starred in the TV movie &quot;Always and Forever&quot; on the Hallmark Channel in October 2009.

In May 2013, Eden appeared with former US President Bill Clinton, Elton John, and Fergie at the opening ceremony of the 21st Life Ball in Vienna, where Eden wore her familiar Jeannie harem costume. She was next cast in the movie &quot;One Song&quot;, filmed the same year. She has also done voice work for the animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;Shimmer and Shine&quot;.

Eden retired around 2021.

==Personal life==

Eden wrote the memoir &quot;Jeannie Out of the Bottle&quot;, published on April 5, 2011 by Crown Archetype, a division of Random House. It debuted at number 14 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

&quot;Jeannie Out of the Bottle&quot; chronicles her personal life and Hollywood career of more than 50 years and includes intimate details about her early childhood, her rise to popularity in her teens and early 20s, her co-stars over the years, and her work leading to &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. It also covers her marriages to Michael Ansara (1958–1974), Charles Fegert (1977–1982), and Jon Eicholtz (1991–present), and her &quot;emotional breakdown&quot; following the 2001 death of her son Matthew Ansara (1965–2001) from a drug overdose.

In June 2021, while talking about her children&#x27;s book &quot;Barbara and the Djinn&quot;, Eden revealed that she and her husband Jon Eicholtz had recovered from COVID-19. In 2023, she celebrated her 92nd birthday and said, &quot;My life is very centered around my family, my house, my husband, my dog Bentley and my friends.&quot;

==Honors==
On November 17, 1988, Eden received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to television. In 1990, the University of West Los Angeles law school granted Eden an honorary doctor of laws degree.

<doc id="707931" wikidata="Q4896020" url="?curid=707931" title="Berwick railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Berwick railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the Pakenham and Gippsland lines, which are part of the Melbourne railway network and Regional railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Berwick, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Berwick station is a ground-level premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 8 October 1877.

==History==

Berwick station opened on 8 October 1877, when the railway line from Dandenong was extended to Pakenham. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, England, the birthplace of Robert Gardiner, who was an early leaseholder in the area.

In 1956, the line between Berwick and Officer was duplicated, with a signal panel also installed at the station in that year. In 1962, duplication between Berwick and Narre Warren was provided.

In 1970, flashing light signals were provided at the former Clyde Road level crossing, which was located nearby in the up direction of the station. On 12 October 1982, at around 11:15am, Hitachi carriage 137M, leading a Dandenong – Pakenham shuttle service, collided with a semi-trailer at the level crossing. The collision derailed 137M, flipping it on its side. Eleven people were injured in the collision. 137M was later withdrawn due to the collision.

In 1986, boom barriers were provided at the former level crossing. During September 1988, the former No. 2 and No. 3 roads were removed. In December of that year, a number of points and signals were abolished.

In 1998, Berwick was upgraded to a premium station.

On 1 December 2018, the signal panel was abolished.

In February 2022, the Clyde Road level crossing was grade separated, as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. The level crossing was removed by building a road underpass beneath the railway line. The grade separation works also included upgrading the bus interchange at the station. On 21 February of that year, Clyde Road reopened to vehicular traffic.

== Platforms and services ==

Berwick has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Pakenham line services, as well as selected V/Line Traralgon services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* one weekday morning V/Line service to Southern Cross (set-down only)

Platform 2:
* all stations services to East Pakenham
* one weekday afternoon V/Line service to Traralgon (pick-up only)

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Pakenham line will be through-routed with those on the Sunbury line, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Beaconsfield railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Beaconsfield, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Beaconsfield station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 1 December 1879.

==History==

Beaconsfield station opened on 1 December 1879, just over two years after the railway line from Dandenong was extended to Pakenham. The station gets its name from statesman Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1874 and 1880.

In 1967, the goods siding was closed to traffic, and was removed later in that same year.

In 1978, flashing light signals were provided at the Station/Goff Street level crossing, located nearby in the down direction of the station, with boom barriers provided later on in 1986.

There is a car-park nearby for travellers. In mid December 2020, a further expansion of an additional car-park of 150 spaces was completed on state-owned land. Improved lighting and CCTV was provided, along with a secure bicycle parking shed and extra bicycle stands. More than 250,000 commuters use the station each year.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Station Street/Goff Street level crossing will be grade separated by 2025, with a new road bridge to be built over the railway line. In November 2023, major construction started on the project to remove the Station Street/Goff Street level crossing. On 5 February 2024, final designs for the new road bridge were released.

The former railway house at 20 Beaconsfield Avenue was built in 1888 and, in 1900, was acquired for use as a station master&#x27;s house. It is now a private residence.

== Platforms and services ==

Beaconsfield has one island platform with two faces. It is located at the corner of Woods Street and Beaconsfield Avenue. From the opposite side of the railway line, it is located along Kenilworth Avenue.

It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Pakenham line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to East Pakenham

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Pakenham line will be through-routed with those on the Sunbury line, via the new Metro Tunnel.

==Transport links==

Ventura Bus Lines operates two routes via Beaconsfield station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Berwick station – Eden Rise Shopping Centre
* : Pakenham station – Westfield Fountain Gate

<text>Officer railway station is a commuter railway station on the Pakenham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Officer, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Officer station is a ground-level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 4 August 1881, with the current station provided in 1956.

Initially opened as Officer&#x27;s Siding, the station was given its current name of Officer on 13 February 1888.

== History ==
Officer station opened on 4 August 1881, almost four years after the railway line was extended from Dandenong to Pakenham. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Robert Officer, a local pastoralist. Another theory is that the station and suburb were named after the Officer family, who were originally from Deniliquin, New South Wales.

In 1955, the line between Officer and Pakenham was duplicated and, on 13 May 1956, duplication between Officer and Berwick was provided. In that year, a new station was also provided east of the original site.

In 1976, flashing light signals were provided at the former Station Street level crossing, which was located nearby in the up direction of the station. A decade later, in 1986, boom barriers were provided.

On 8 May 1987, a collision involving a Flinders Street-bound Comeng train set and V/Line locomotive N457, operating an up Traralgon service, occurred in the down direction of the station. 45 people were injured in the collision. Comeng carriage 388M was later scrapped due to the collision, however, part of the carriage was later used as a café in the pedestrian underpass at Werribee.

In 1988, the former goods siding was taken out of service. The main line points leading into the siding were spiked, and were removed at a later date.

Sometime during or after 1995, the present station shelters were provided, replacing timber station buildings.

During the 2011/2012 financial year, it was the second least used station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan system, with 55,000 passenger movements.

On 29 July 2021, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Station Street level crossing will be closed to vehicle traffic by 2025, and was replaced with the pedestrian gates located further up next to the station.

On 18 May 2024, Station Street level crossing and equipment was removed and the road was permanently closed. It was replaced by the existing pedestrian crossing gates located further up next to Officer station.

== Platforms and services ==

Officer has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Pakenham line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to East Pakenham

In 2025, it is planned that trains on the Pakenham line will be through-routed with those on the Sunbury line, via the new Metro Tunnel.

<text>Pakenham railway station is a commuter and regional railway station on the suburban Pakenham line and regional Gippsland line, part of the Melbourne and Victorian railways networks. It serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Pakenham in Victoria, Australia. Pakenham is an elevated premium station, featuring an island platform with two faces. It opened on 8 October 1877, with the current station provided in 2024. 

Stabling facilities were located on the south side of the station, until their removal in 2022.

== History ==
Pakenham station opened when the railway line from Dandenong was extended. Like the suburb itself, the station is named after Sir Edward Michael Pakenham, a major general who served in the Peninsular War.

In 1938, flashing light signals were provided at the former Main Street level crossing, which was located at the up end of the station.

Initially a single track, the line between Pakenham and Nar Nar Goon was duplicated in 1954. In 1955, the line between Pakenham and Officer was duplicated and an island platform was provided in 1959, when duplication occurred through the station.

On 19 January 1975, electrified suburban services were extended to the station. A crossover was also provided at the up end of the station around that time. During 1979–1980, the former ground level pebbledash station building was constructed.

On 16 April 1980, Pakenham was the scene of a collision between Hitachi carriage 353D and guards van 286ZL. The guards van was destroyed in the collision and the Hitachi carriage was later scrapped.

In 1986, boom barriers were provided at the Main Street level crossing.

On 15 March 1997, Pakenham was upgraded to a premium station. Between 2001 and 2024, it was the terminus of the Melbourne electrified rail network.

On 9 March 2011, a Siemens train over-ran No. 5 road near the station, crashing into a stanchion.

In March 2014, it was announced that a new train servicing facility would be built at Pakenham East, to maintain the new High Capacity Metro Trains.

In May 2024, the Main Street level crossing was grade separated, as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project. A rail bridge was built over the road, and included a new, rebuilt elevated station. As part of the project, Pakenham line services were extended by approximately to a new station at East Pakenham.

On 17 May 2024, McGregor Road, Main Street and Racecourse Road level crossings were eliminated. On the same night, the old ground-level Pakenham station was closed and demolished. The rebuilt Pakenham station and new East Pakenham station opened on 3 June 2024. At the time of reopening, the northern side of the station building (including platform 2) was only partially finished, with the platform only accessible via temporary stairs. Works will continue on the northern side for the construction of permanent stairs and lift until late 2024.

== Platforms and services ==
Pakenham has two side platforms. It is served by Pakenham line trains, and V/Line Traralgon and Bairnsdale line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street
* V/Line services to Southern Cross

Platform 2:

<text>Merinda Park railway station is a commuter railway station on the Cranbourne line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Cranbourne North, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and opened on 24 March 1995. The original station was built with a double platform, designed with a future duplication in mind. A fence ran alongside the unused platform.Instead, the station was rebuilt and the current station was opened in 2022.

==History==
Merinda Park station opened as part of the electrification of the line to Cranbourne. The station is named after an adjacent housing estate, opened in the 1980s.

In 1977, flashing light signals were provided at the former Thompsons Road level crossing, which was located in the down direction from the station. In 1995, boom barriers were provided at the crossing in conjunction with the electrification project. On 25 June 2018, the level crossing was eliminated as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

In December 2019, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the station would be completely rebuilt as part of the Cranbourne line duplication. A second platform was added, and the main entrance moved to a more central location. On 18 March 2021, part of the new station opened, with the remainder completed by 13 February 2022. The duplication allowed an improved timetable for the Cranbourne line, with services operating roughly every 10 minutes during the morning peak.

==Platforms and services==
Merinda Park has two side platforms and is served by Cranbourne line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Dandenong

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Cranbourne

<text>Cranbourne railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Cranbourne line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of the same name, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and opened on 1 October 1888. The station was closed between 24 July 1993 and 24 March 1995, and the current station was opened in 2008.

==History==
Cranbourne opened as a station on the South Gippsland line. Until 24 July 1993, it was served by V/Line trains to Leongatha and beyond. As with the suburb itself, the station got its name from the Cranbourne Inn, established in the mid-19th century by the Ruffy brothers, who were squatters in the area. The area was named either after a town in Berkshire, England or Viscount Cranborne.

Between March 1920 and June 1956, trains regularly operated from sidings about south of the station, dispatching between ten and thirty goods trucks a week, loaded with locally mined construction-quality sand.

In 1959, flashing light signals were provided at the former South Gippsland Highway level crossing, which was at the down end of the station.

In early 1973, a water tank that had been located within the former station yard was removed.

In 1981, flashing light signals were provided at the former Camms Road level crossing, which was located in the up direction from the station. Boom barriers were installed during the electrification of the line.

In November 1993, Train Order Working replaced Electric Staff safeworking to Cranbourne. On 24 March 1995, the electrification and power signalling of the line from Dandenong was commissioned. In 1994, during the electrification project, the original station building was removed by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society. The former goods shed, and a number of tracks, had been removed from the station yard by August of that year.

The last regular train beyond Cranbourne ran on 15 January 1998, after which sand trains from Koala Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood ceased operating.

In April 2008, work started on the construction of six train stabling sidings at the station, to enable more trains to run on the line at peak times without having to duplicate the line. The work was completed in November of that year. As part of that project, the station and bus interchange received an upgrade.

At the 2018 and 2022 state elections, the Coalition promised to extend the Cranbourne line to the suburb of Clyde.

On 30 November 2018, the Level Crossing Removal Project announced that the Camms Road level crossing would be grade separated. On 25 June 2021, designs for the level crossing were released, which involved raising Camms Road over the railway line via an overpass. Construction commenced on the project in early 2023 and, on 30 November of that year, the overpass opened to road traffic.

The Level Crossing Removal Project also managed the duplication of the railway line between Cranbourne and Dandenong. Major work started in 2020, and was completed by 13 February 2022, a year ahead of schedule. The duplication also involved a new timetable for the Cranbourne line, with services operating roughly every 10 minutes during the morning peak-hour.

<text>Prahran railway station (/pɛ&#x27;ræn) is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Prahran, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Prahran station is a ground level host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 22 December 1860.

Initially opened as Greville Street, the station was given its current name of Prahran on 1 January 1867.

==History==
Prahran station opened on 22 December 1860, when the railway line from South Yarra was extended to Windsor. Like the suburb itself, the station was named from the Indigenous word ‘purraran’, believed to mean ‘almost surrounded by water’.

In 1962, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Greville Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station. The signal box that protected the level crossing was also abolished during that time.

In October 1979, automatic semaphore signals were replaced with light signals between Prahran and Windsor.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Prahran to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

==Platforms and services==

Prahran has two side platforms. It is served by Sandringham line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Sandringham

==Transport links==

Yarra Trams operates three routes via Prahran station:
* : Moreland station – Glen Iris
* : Melbourne University – Camberwell

<doc id="707942" wikidata="Q8024758" url="?curid=707942" title="Windsor railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Windsor railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Windsor, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Windsor station is a ground level host station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 19 December 1859.

Initially opened as Chapel Street, the station was given its current name of Windsor on 1 January 1867.

The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==History==
===Link to St Kilda===
The station was the terminus for services on the Brighton Beach line, which opened in 1859, and operated by the St Kilda &amp; Brighton Railway Company. The company also built the loop branch line, connecting the Brighton line to the Melbourne – St Kilda line, which opened in 1857.

Services from Melbourne travelled to the St Kilda terminus, and then &quot;backed out&quot; onto the loop line to Windsor. The loop ran on timber trestles across the swampy ground now known as Albert Park Lake, and included a raised embankment, with a bridge over St Kilda Road. On 3 December 1859, the first train on the loop ran, with the line opening to the public ten days later. There were no trains after 7pm on the branch line, so passengers had to walk from St Kilda to their homes in Prahran.

A short time after the loop line was constructed, a direct connection was built between South Yarra and Windsor, with the first train arriving at Windsor directly from Melbourne on 24 November 1860. As a consequence, the loop line to St Kilda fell into disuse, and track duplication, a condition of the original crown lease, was never completed.

===Sidings===
The St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company experienced financial difficulties and, in 1862, was bought by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company. The track, bridge and trestles between St Kilda and Punt Road were dismantled, but a short section was retained as a siding at Windsor. Due to the track alignments, there were two level crossings within 100 metres on Union Street, because the siding continued to be used for shunting trains from the Brighton line, and to carry screenings from the Richmond quarries to a commercial depot on Punt Road (then known as Hoddle Street).

Perversely, it was due to local annoyance at the siding level crossing near the station that trains won the legal right-of-way at road-rail intersections in Victoria. Indignant at the delays to horse-drawn traffic caused by trains, and in particular the perpetually closed and unmanned crossing at the siding, local councillors from Prahran marched to the level crossing in question one morning in 1869, with a group of workers who began to rip up the tracks on the siding. On 17 April of that year, the matter was brought to court and, although the railways won the right-of-way case, the siding was not reconstructed.

No evidence of the bridge over St Kilda Road or the embankments remain, although the alignment of the loop can be traced by the residual parkland and some oddly-shaped property boundaries. A small park to the west of Windsor is called &quot;Windsor Siding&quot;.

===1887 accident===
On the evening of 11 May 1887, an express train collided into the rear of a stopping all stations train between Prahran and Windsor. Four people were killed and over 100 severely injured. The all stations train had been halted short of Windsor by a signal. When the signal to proceed was given, the driver could not release the brakes on his train due to a ruptured air pipe. An express train from Melbourne was scheduled 10 minutes behind the stopping train and, due to a curve in the track and a deep cutting, the crew of the express could not see the stationary train ahead. Cooper (1924) reported that the noise of the impact could be heard throughout Prahran and that, in a short time, over 10,000 people were gathered at the site. The driver of the Brighton express, Frederick William Maskell, was killed, along with his fireman, James Houston McNab, William Runting, aged 21, and Annie Foster, aged 45, of Colac. Only weeks earlier, Maskell had received a special reward of £5 from the Railways Commissioners for his alertness in averting an accident after another driver had disregarded a signal.

===20th century===
In February 1972, the overhead wiring above No. 1 road was removed.

The goods yard existed at the up end of the station, until its closure in December 1977.

During 1979, a crossover and connections to the former goods yard were spiked out of use, and a number of dwarf signals were abolished. In October of that year, automatic semaphore signals were replaced with light signals between Windsor and Prahran.

In 1983, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Union Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station. The signal box for the level crossing was also abolished during this time.

===21st century===
On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Windsor to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

<text>Balaclava railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Balaclava, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Balaclava station is a ground level premium station, featuring two side platforms, with a customer service desk on platform 1. It opened on 19 December 1859, with the current station provided in 2014.

Balaclava is an elevated station, and is located above the Carlisle Street rail overpass.

== History ==
Balaclava station opened on 19 December 1859, when the railway line from Windsor was extended to North Brighton. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after the Battle of Balaclava, which occurred during the Crimean War in 1854.

On 3 December 1977, the station was damaged by fire. In 1981, the station buildings were rebuilt.

In 1996, two men found $200,000 in a drum buried beneath one of the platforms. They handed the money in to the police and the find was reported in the media. In the same week, another man found a second drum under the platform, containing a similar quantity of money, which he also turned in to the police. Because no one claimed it, the men were granted ownership of the money they found, despite being considered trespassers on land owned by the then Public Transport Corporation.

In June 2012, a $13.3 million upgrade to the station was announced. It involved widening the platforms, improving stair and ramp access, signage, booking office facilities, waiting rooms, wheelchair shelters and toilets, and the provision of new station canopies to increase weather protection. CCTV cameras were added, as well as provision for future lifts. In October 2014, construction works were completed, with Balaclava upgraded to a premium station.

Following a 2019 commitment by the Federal Government, the station was due to receive an upgraded commuter car-park. However, this was scrapped by the same government in 2021.

<text>Elsternwick railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Elsternwick, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Elsternwick station is a ground level premium station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 19 December 1859, with the current station provided in 1960.

==History==

Elsternwick station was originally part of the Melbourne &amp; Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company&#x27;s network. The company and network was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878, to become part of Victorian Railways. As with the nearby suburb of Ripponlea, which had been named after the adjacent Rippon Lea Estate of Frederick Sargood, Elsternwick had been named after the largest property in the district, Charles Ebden&#x27;s &quot;Elster&quot;.

In the 1880s, Elsternwick also functioned as the western end of the cross-suburban Rosstown Railway, which was built by entrepreneur William Murray Ross, mainly to serve the sugar beet processing mill that he had established, along with an adjoining residential estate in the locality he called Rosstown, now known as Carnegie. The railway was seldom used and it was officially closed in 1916.

In 1915, an electric tramline between Elsternwick and Point Ormond opened. It closed on 22 October 1960, after which the tram route became part of an extended 246 bus route. In February 1959, a project commenced to eliminate the Glen Huntly Road level crossing, where a tramway also crossed the rail line. A temporary two-track station was provided in a side street parallel with the station, which allowed rail services to continue uninterrupted. In October 1960, the work was completed, which was when the present railway buildings were provided.

In 1992, the station was the first in Melbourne to receive the former Public Transport Corporation&#x27;s teal, sunflower and white coloured station signage, which has since been replaced with Public Transport Victoria branded blue signage. On 13 November 1995, Elsternwick was upgraded to a premium station.

During 2002–2003, the ground-level station car-park was closed, with a residential/retail development built on it, as part of a deal under which a developer was given the land with the condition that a multi-storey car park, including a lift, was provided for passengers. In 2004, the station underwent a refurbishment.

==Platforms and services==

Elsternwick has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Sandringham line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:

<text>Gardenvale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Brighton, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Gardenvale station is an elevated unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 10 December 1906.

The station has two side platforms, and is located in an unusual elevated position, located between the Nepean Highway and Martin Street, with access to the station from both.

==History==

Gardenvale station opened on 10 December 1906, with the whole cost of providing the station met by local residents of the district. The origins of the name of the station, and the suburb itself, are uncertain, although it may have been inspired by nearby market gardens throughout the undulating countryside.

In 1928, the rail bridge over Martin Street, which restored a link between both sections of the street, was constructed, with most of the cost being met by the Brighton and Caulfield councils, and local businesses.

In 1972, the current girder bridge over the Nepean Highway was provided. During the widening of the Nepean Highway in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the previous rail embankment was removed, the former trestle bridge crossing Elster Creek was uncovered.

There is a large weatherboard building on Platform 1, with a smaller weatherboard building on Platform 2. On 7 December 2009, the building on Platform 1 was severely damaged by fire, which investigators described as suspicious. In January 2011, restoration of the building began, with reconstruction work being completed by the middle of that year.

==Platforms and services==

<text>Brighton Beach railway station is a commuter railway station, located on the Sandringham line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Brighton, opened on 21 December 1861 as Beach, and renamed Brighton Beach on 1 January 1867. Brighton Beach is a ground level premium station, featuring three platforms, an island platform with two faces, a curved face on platform 2 and a straight face on platform 1 and one side platform with a curved face, however, platform one is not in use while platforms 2 and 3 are in use. The station building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, noted for its unusual shape and proximity to the coastline. The Brighton Bathing Boxes are located a short walk from the station.

The station consists of three platforms, a terminating platform currently used as a siding, and two curved platforms, built in 1887 when the line was extended to Sandringham, accessed through the station building. The single station building, constructed in 1889, replaced a timber building provided when the station was first opened. The station is fully accessible.

The station is serviced by the Sandringham line, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station connects to the routes 600, 603 and 923 bus services. The journey to Southern Cross railway station is approximately 15.97 km (9.92 mi).

== Description ==
Brighton Beach station is located in Brighton, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located close to the beach, hence its name. Directly to the south of the station is a level crossing with South Road. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The adjacent stations are Middle Brighton up towards Flinders Street and Hampton down towards Sandringham.

The station consists of three platforms: an island with a terminating platform used as a siding, and a curved platform, and a curved side platform, connected by a footbridge and the main station building. The curved platforms were built in 1887, when the line was extended to Sandringham. A stabling yard with two tracks is located adjacent to Platform 1. The yard was originally used for stabling, but was converted to a siding for the VICERS project. In 2010, the stabling facilities were reinstated. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The station is fully accessible, and is a premium station, meaning it is staffed from first train to last.

The station building, located between platforms one and two, was designed by George Sims and built by contractor Donald Swanson in 1889, replacing a timber structure erected when the station was first opened as a terminus. Similar buildings were constructed later at North Brighton and Prahran. The Victorian Heritage Register notes its unusual shape, wedged between two platforms. It also notes its uniqueness in railway architecture, noting architectural features including &quot;the pedimented entrance porch, the patterned brickwork, the tiled frieze below the eaves cornice, the bluestone columns at the barriers, the tessellated paving to the entrance lobby, the round brick arches and the additional red brick banding at the entry&quot;.

== History ==
Brighton Beach station opened on 21 December 1861, when the railway line from North Brighton was extended, with a timber station building and a single terminating platform. It was named after the nearby Brighton Beach, a popular destination at the time. It remained a terminus until 2 September 1887, when the line was extended to Sandringham, with two additional curved platforms added. In 1889, the current station building was constructed, and in 1919, the line to Sandringham was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires. In 1926, a signal box was constructed, located between the down end of Platform 2 and the South Road level crossing.

Since 1926, the station has stayed largely the same, with only minor changes taking place. In 1968, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the South Road level crossing, located at the down end of the station.

On 20 November 1995, Brighton Beach was upgraded to a premium station.

The signal box controlled the swing gates at the New Street level crossing, which were the last left in Victoria. In 2007, the swing gates were hit by a train, causing significant damage. In 2010, the level crossing was closed by the Brumby government, with plans to re-open the level crossing with boom barriers. The project, which cost $4.4 million, included the replacement of the hand-operated gates with boom barriers, installation of flashing lights and bells, and a wider pedestrian crossing. It was opened in 2013 by Brighton MP Louise Asher.

Following a 2019 commitment by the Federal Government, the station was due to receive an upgraded commuter car park. However, this was scrapped by the same government in 2021.

==Platforms and services==

Brighton Beach consists of an island platform with two faces and a side platform, being the only station on the Sandringham line to have three platforms. There is a large brick building on Platforms 1 and 2 (island platform), housing an enclosed waiting area, ticket facilities and toilets. There are also ticket facilities at the up (Flinders Street) end of the island platform, for customers accessing Brighton Beach via the footbridge. Platform 3 has a smaller brick building, with a waiting area, ticket facilities and a payphone. Being a Premium Station, Brighton Beach is staffed from first to last train each day.

In 2011, a fence was erected on Platform 2 to direct passengers to the front half of the train and discourage them from boarding the rear half, because of the large gap between the train and the platform due to the station being built on a sharp curve. Additionally, station staff are required to be in attendance on Platform 2 for all train services, to ensure passengers have boarded safely, as there have been cases of passengers falling into the gap between the train and the platform.

The station is served by Sandringham line trains. Once the Metro Tunnel opens, Sandringham line trains will run through to Williamstown and Werribee.

Platform 1:
* No trains alight or board passengers from Platform 1, with the platform currently closed off to passengers, and the mainline connection out of use. The 2012 Network Development Plan – Metropolitan Rail proposed reopening this platform as a turnback, enabling a service level above that possible with the single platform terminus at Sandringham.

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Sandringham

==Transport links==

Kinetic Melbourne operates three bus routes via Brighton Beach station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Westfield Southland – St Kilda station
* : to Burnley station 
* : Westfield Southland – St Kilda station
Formerly, Brighton Beach was served by a tram line from St Kilda, with the extension from Middle Brighton to Brighton Beach opening in December 1906. After a lack of maintenance causing severe issues with the line, a material and finance shortage during World War II, and finally a decrease in patronage due to bus and car competition, the line was closed between Brighton Beach and Middle Brighton in January 1956, and closed fully in February 1959, despite protests from the community.

<doc id="707957" wikidata="Q5646342" url="?curid=707957" title="Hampton railway station, Melbourne">
<text>Hampton railway station is a commuter railway station on the Sandringham line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Hampton in Victoria, Australia. Hampton is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms, connected by a disabled access footbridge and accessed through by brick station buildings provided in the platforms. It opened on 2 September 1887, with the current station provided in 1975.

Initially opened as Hampton, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Retreat on 2 October 1887, then was given its original and current name of Hampton on 10 September 1889. The level crossing at Hampton Street is located on the south side of the station. The station has independent disabled access.

==History==

Hampton station opened on 2 September 1887, when the railway line from Brighton Beach was extended to Sandringham. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Dyas Hampton, an early local market gardener. Developers at the time also like the regal sounding name, which was akin to neighbouring suburb Sandringham.

In 1906, an 80 year old man got off of a train at night, and slipped between the train and the platform, suffering a broken thigh. The Shire of Moorabbin passed a resolution for the station to be lit up.

In 1924, the station building was broken into, with some parcels being rifled through. In 1930, a 33 year old man was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for breaking into the station building around three weeks earlier. In 1936, there were requests to the City of Sandringham for &quot;beautification&quot; to occur around the station. The council, in 1920, had bought land around the station for the same purposes, however they found the land to be boggy and difficult to cultivate, and the title was handed back. Ward members from Hampton advised for the works not to go through.

In 1966, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Hampton Street level crossing, located at the south (down) end of the station. The signal box which protected the level crossing was also abolished during this time. On 16 January 1968, a collision involving two Tait train sets occurred between Hampton and Sandringham.

In 1975, the present brick station buildings were provided.

On 30 August 2002, Comeng motor carriage 500M was destroyed by fire as it travelled between Hampton and Sandringham.

In November 2016, a proposed development near the station generated controversy, as it was seen as &quot;bringing a white cruise ship&quot; to Hampton.

==Platforms and services==

Hampton has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Sandringham line services.

On rare occasions, extra services for major events may originate at Hampton instead of Sandringham. These services are formed by empty trains directly from the stabling yard at Sandringham.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Sandringham

<text>Lennie Michael James (born 11 October 1965) is a British actor. He is best known for portraying Morgan Jones in the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and in its spin-off, &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;, and starring as DCI Tony Gates in &quot;Line of Duty&quot; series one.

Among James&#x27; more notable roles in television is Glen Boyle in the medical drama &quot;Critical&quot; on Sky 1. On American television, he portrayed the mysterious Robert Hawkins in the CBS series &quot;Jericho&quot; and Detective Joe Geddes in the AMC series &quot;Low Winter Sun&quot;.

James created and starred in Sky Atlantic drama series &quot;Save Me&quot; which was released in 2018 to critical acclaim. Its second season, titled &quot;Save Me Too&quot;, won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Series 2021.

==Early life==
James was born in Nottingham, the son of Afro-Trinidadian parents. He lived in South London and attended school at Ernest Bevin College. His mother, Phyllis Mary James, died when he was 10, after which he and his elder brother, Kester, chose to live in a children&#x27;s home instead of being sent to the United States to reside with a relative. James remained in foster care for eight years.

James aspired to be a professional rugby player as a teen, and was introduced to acting after following a girl he was interested in to an audition for a play. James attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, graduating in 1988. While there, he helped run a campaign against the school&#x27;s plan to expel another student, which he has said is the bravest thing he&#x27;s ever done. &quot;That involved being taken in front of the head and threatening to boycott a big event for the Lord Mayor, even though the head said it would mean they would throw me out,&quot; James said in 2015. 
He was once employed by the social security office.

==Career==

James has appeared in more than 20 films, including &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1998), &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), &quot;Sahara&quot; (2005), and &quot;Outlaw&quot; (2007). He starred in the 2010 film &quot;Tic&quot; and appeared in the action film &quot;Colombiana&quot; (2011) and the sci-fi film &quot;Lockout&quot; (2012).

He began his career in theatre. In 1982, while studying social work, he was accepted at a workshop at the Cockpit Theatre. The following year he submitted his play &quot;Trial and Error&quot; to the National Youth Theatre-Texaco Playwriting Competition, winning Most Prominent Playwright Under 21. While studying for his a-levels he performed at Shiftwork, a youth theatre program at the Lyric Theatre, while &quot;Trial and Error&quot; was published by Faber and Faber in 1984. In 1992, he received the Clarence Derwent Award for his supporting role in &quot;The Coup&quot; by Mustapha Matura at the Royal National Theatre.
James wrote the autobiographical TV film, &quot;Storm Damage&quot; in 2000, which was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series. &quot;Storm Damage&quot; depicts a teacher who tries to go back to the foster home he left and help the teenagers there, as James did. He also wrote the play &quot;The Sons of Charlie Paora&quot;, which opened at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre in 2004.

On television, one of James’ earliest appearances was as DC Carl Tanner in series 2, episode 1 of &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; (1994). James subsequently appeared in the short-lived Channel 4 prison drama &quot;Buried&quot; (2003), the BBC terrorism drama &quot;The State Within&quot; (2006), the BBC spy drama &quot;Spooks&quot; (2002–2011), and he starred as Robert Hawkins in the CBS post-apocalyptic drama series &quot;Jericho&quot; (2006). James appeared in a Channel 4 television drama &quot;Fallout&quot; (2008), playing the role of a detective alongside another detective solving a teen-related murder. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Lie to Me&quot;, as well as the 2009 AMC/ITV miniseries &quot;The Prisoner, of&quot; which he said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t necessarily the easiest gig I’ve ever been on, but it was always acting.&quot; He appeared in HBO&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Hung&quot; as a pimp.

James appeared in episodes of the 2010 TV series &quot;Human Target&quot; as the assassin Baptiste. In 2012, he received critical acclaim for his appearance as DCI Tony Gates in BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, created by Jed Mercurio.

In 2010, he guest-starred as Morgan Jones in the pilot episode of the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, titled &quot;Days Gone Bye&quot;. In 2013, he reprised his role as Morgan Jones in an episode of the third season of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; titled &quot;Clear&quot;. On 12 October 2014, James made his return to the show in a post-credit scene at the end of the fifth-season premiere and appeared again in a single scene at the end of the mid-season finale on 30 November 2014. He returned for the fifth-season finale and played a significant role in the episode. Despite his few appearances on the show, James has received significant recognition for his portrayal of Morgan from critics and fans, including being stopped by a policeman who wanted to talk to him about the show. He returned as a main cast member in the show&#x27;s sixth season until the eighth season. As of 15 April 2018, James appears as Morgan in the fourth season of &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; as a series regular.

On 29 March 2015, James&#x27; character was featured throughout the fifth-season finale. The actor&#x27;s post-show appearance on the &quot;Talking Dead&quot;—in which he did not speak with an American accent—caused the hashtag #morganisbritish to trend on Twitter.

James stars as Glenn Boyle on the medical drama &quot;Critical&quot; which debuted on Sky 1 in February 2015. He spent nearly a year away from his home in Los Angeles to film the series. Each episode takes place in &quot;real time,&quot; with the medical staff having to save a life in an hour. James spent a week shadowing doctors at a London hospital to prepare for the role.

James said his favourite television show is the 1980s police drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, telling the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;It’s the one that spawned every other show. It’s the Muhammad Ali or Pelé of television shows.&quot;

James has also portrayed the &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Destiny 2&quot; character Lord Shaxx who is the host of the in-game PVP (Player Versus Player) &quot;The Crucible&quot; in which he voices over matches and also has an in game vendor to purchase items, and bounties. In an interview with &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Lennie stated his favorite line in the game, was in fact a line straight out of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The line in question is in game as &quot;But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and I--I am the Crucible.&quot;

==Personal life==
James lives in Los Angeles, California, US with wife Giselle Glasman. They have three children together. He is the main cook for his family and has professed a fondness for Caribbean cuisine. He is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club and Valencia Club de Fútbol (from Spain).

James is among the celebrities who have penned an open &quot;letter to my younger self&quot; for &quot;The Big Issue&quot; magazine. In his letter in March 2015, he wrote about the pain of losing his mother at a young age. &quot;It hit me quite strongly. It had just been the three of us: my brother, my mum and me. Everything changed when the terrible thing happened. It had a profound, fundamental effect on me. One disappointment is that I never knew my mum as an adult,&quot; he wrote.

James also works as a mentor to black inner-city children, and says he rejects the importance people attach to fame and celebrity. &quot;Boys and men in our community need to be aware of the guy who gets up every morning and goes to the job that he doesn&#x27;t necessarily love, in order to support his family. They are the heroes my community need to celebrate,&quot; he said.

<text>Sandringham railway station is a commuter railway station and the terminus of the Sandringham line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Sandringham, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Sandringham station is a ground level premium station, featuring a single platform. It opened on 2 September 1887.

A signal box is located at the up (Flinders Street) end of the station, whilst a stabling yard is located directly opposite to the station, stabling up to four trains overnight.

==History==

Sandringham station opened on 2 September 1887, when the railway line from Brighton Beach was extended. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after Sandringham House, which was inspired by landowner and parliamentarian Charles H. Jones who, between 1864–1871 and 1886–1889, was a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.

A tram service, operated by the Victorian Railways, operated from Sandringham to Black Rock from 1919 until 1956. In 1957, the station was closed to goods traffic.

In 1967, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the Abbott Street level crossing, located at the up end of the station. On 16 January 1968, a collision involving two Tait train sets occurred between Hampton and Sandringham.

On 17 June 1988, No. 5 road was abolished, leaving the platform road and three siding roads. On 30 October 1995, Sandringham was upgraded to a premium station.

On 30 August 2002, Comeng motor carriage 500M was destroyed by fire as it travelled between Hampton and Sandringham.

On 9 March 2011, a Siemens Nexas train overshot one of the sidings and crashed into a branch of the Bendigo Bank.

==Platforms and services==

Sandringham has one platform. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Sandringham line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

<doc id="707960" wikidata="Q14935157" url="?curid=707960" title="Heyington railway station">
<text>Heyington railway station is a commuter railway station on the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Toorak, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Heyington station is a ground level staffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 24 March 1890, with the current station provided in 1975.

The station does not have any transport connections unlike the majority of Melbourne train stations. The journey to Southern Cross railway station is approximately 7.12 kilometres (4.42 mi) and takes 25 minutes.

== Description ==

Heyington railway station located in the suburb of Toorak, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. North of the station is the Yarra River and east of the station is St Kevin&#x27;s College. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is 7.12 kilometres (4.42 mi), or a 15-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station. The adjacent stations are Burnley station up towards Melbourne, and Kooyong station down towards Glen Waverley.&quot;&quot;

The station consists of two side platforms two platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately long, enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. The station features one main station building, located on platform 1. This building acts as toilet, automated ticketing, and PSO facilities. The station building is made from wood and ribbed metal roofing.

The station building, concourse, and platform are largely the same as when the station was rebuilt in 1975. There is no bike or car parking are available at the station. The station is the only one in Melbourne accessed solely by stairs, with both platforms requiring stair access from the pedestrian footbridge.

==History==
Heyington railway station was opened on 24 March 1890 with the line through the station originally built to link Burnley to the Outer Circle line at Waverley Road, before continuing onto Oakleigh. The station was named after nearby Heyington Place, which provides access to the station. The line underwent numerous extensions over its life, with extensions to East Malvern in 1929 and to Glen Waverley in 1930. In 1926, duplication of the line between Heyington and Burnley stations occurred, with duplication between Heyington and Kooyong stations occurring in 1955. Duplication of the line to Darling occurred in 1956, with the line fully duplicated to Glen Waverley by 1964. In 1969, the current overpass, located just beyond the up end of the station, was provided.

In 1975, the current station building on Platform 1 was provided, with parcel facilities also being abolished around this time. On 23 June 1979, the new station building was partially damaged by fire. Minor upgrades have occurred at the station since 1975, with a new roof installed on the Platform 1 station structure in 2022 and other technological, safety, and signage upgrades.

=== February 2014 fatality ===

On 22 February 2014, an 18 year old male was fatally injured when he fell between a moving train and the platform. He was running alongside the moving train when he fell attempting to board it, while passengers inside the train were forcibly holding the carriage doors open. An Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) report found that due to the pressure applied by passengers, the traction interlock system (as designed) automatically deactivated after a period of time. This allowed traction to be applied and the train to depart with the carriage doors open. Large platform gaps as a result of platform curvature also contributed to the accident. The report found a total of four main issues, those being the inadequacy of the doors open warning device, the standards for train and platform clearances, the ability for the train to move with the carriage doors open, and the platform clearances. In a bid to prevent further fatalities from arising, Metro Trains Melbourne (MTM) has realigned the track at Heyington station and installed rubber &quot;bridges&quot; along the entire edge of the platform face. Furthermore, a barrier has also been installed at the platform entrance to deter passengers from running for the train.

On the wider network, MTM has also completed a survey of all stations with curved track and platforms that are at a higher risk of an issue occurring. In the short term, these platforms have had ‘Mind the Gap’ signs painted on them with the addition of announcement to alert passengers of the presence of a gap. In the long term, plans and strategies have been adopted to remove these safety issues permanently from the network.

==Platforms and services==
Heyington has two side platforms with two faces. The station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line—a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Glen Waverley line runs from Glen Waverley station south east of Melbourne, joining the Belgrave, Lilydale, and Alamein lines at Burnley station before travelling through the city loop&quot;.&quot;

<text>Kooyong railway station is a commuter railway station on the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Kooyong, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Kooyong station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 24 March 1890, with the current station provided in 1955.

==History==

Kooyong station opened on 24 March 1890, when the railway line from Burnley was extended to Eastmalvern. The station was originally named North Malvern, but was renamed soon after opening, amid fears regarding the name&#x27;s similarity to North Melbourne. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after an Indigenous word meaning either &#x27;camp&#x27;, &#x27;resting place&#x27; or &#x27;haunt of the wild fowl&#x27;.

In 1955, the line between Kooyong and Gardiner was duplicated, with duplication to Heyington occurring in 1957.

A signal box is located at the up end of Platform 2, to control the Glenferrie Road tramway crossing. In 1985, boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at this crossing.

==Platforms and services==

Kooyong has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Glen Waverley line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Glen Waverley

The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is , or a 25-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station. The adjacent stations are Tooronga station up towards Melbourne, and Glen Iris station down towards Glen Waverley.&quot;&quot;

The station consists of two side platforms two platform edges. As is standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately long, sufficient for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. The station features a ground level concourse, accessible from the below ground platforms by stairs and lifts. There is one principal station building, opened in 2016, which contains PSO offices and bike storage facilities. The station building is made primarily from prefabricated steel, with 1700 pavers used in the station forecourt precinct. The building has a contemporary style, characterised by brightly coloured panels and sweeping roofs. The signal box, commissioned in 1917, was decommissioned and restored into public open space as part of level crossing removal works in 2016.

The station building, concourse, and platform are largely the same as when the station was rebuilt in 2016. There are 220 car and 26 protected bike parking spaces available at the station. The station is listed as fully accessible on the Metro Trains website, as there are lifts and accessible features available at the station.

==History==
Gardiner railway station opened on 24 March 1890. The line through the station was originally built to link Burnley to the Outer Circle line at Waverley Road, before continuing onto Oakleigh. The station was named after local pastoralist John Gardiner, who had settled near the junction of the Yarra River and Gardiners Creek in 1836. The line to Darling was duplicated in 1926, alongside other works along the line.

The station was rebuilt in 1975 to coincide with the construction of the South Eastern Arterial link and other station rebuilds along the corridor at the time. This was the first station rebuild since its opening. However, it would not be the last, as the station was rebuilt in 2016 to coincide with level crossing removal works. In 1986, manually controlled boom barriers replaced interlocked gates at the former Burke Road level crossing, which was located at the down end of the station. Also at this time, level crossing safety upgrades occurred, with power operated pedestrian gates provided.


=== Level Crossing Removal Project ===

After numerous accidents at the Burke Road level crossing, the Liberal-National Napthine government announced that the crossing was to be grade-separated by mid-2017. This crossing was one of the last 4 remaining tram-train level crossings in Melbourne. These crossings are notorious for accidents and collisions, as trains and trams have to intersect at different electrical voltages. In 2011, Transport Minister Terry Mulder announced that the government began early planning works for the removal of the Burke Road level crossing, however, no commencement/conclusion date was released.

In May 2014, the government announced a $524 million package to remove three level crossings across Melbourne, to be delivered by VicRoads. The funding package included lowering the rail line underneath Burke Road, the redevelopment of Gardiner station north of its existing location, the construction of a tram super-stop, and the expansion of car parking facilities located south of their current location. The Napthine government lost the state election later that year; however, construction still went ahead under the subsequent Andrews government. This project was incorporated into the newly formed Level Crossing Removal Project in 2015.

During 2015, construction began on the project with piling works and service relocations to create the rail trench. Major construction ramped up with closures of the Glen Waverley line to facilitate further piling and excavation works. In September 2015, demolition of the original station occurred alongside the opening of a temporary station to continue to facilitate rail services. Once the temporary station opened, major excavation works were able to begin. Construction of the station also occurred during this time, with the prefabricated station buildings installed and platforms installed. With works continuing throughout the rest of 2015, the level crossing was removed in early 2016 with the reopening of Burke Road and Gardiner station. The station opened in a basic state, with elevators, paving, additional exits, and other facilities opening later in early 2016. In April 2016, came the completion of the newly resurfaced carpark, the new tram super-stop located north of the station, landscaping, and the rebuilt Gardiner Park—used by the project team as vehicle storage and site office facilities throughout the duration of the project. The redevelopment of Gardiner Park included the construction of a new clubhouse, the installation of a fake grass playing field, and a new playground.

As part of level crossing removal works, the Gardiner station signal box, located on Platform 2, was restored into public space after it was no longer needed to control the former road and tramway crossing. It was closed on 2 January 2016, 16 days before grade separation works concluding and the station reopened. Also built in conjunction with the removal works was an eleven storey high communication tower, aimed at improving identification of trains, and emergency management around the network. Gardiner station is one of 16 stations across the network to feature these installations.

<text>Darling railway station is a commuter railway station in Malvern East, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. The station opened on 24 March 1890 as part of the branch line from Burnley to Waverley Road station. The station consists of two side platforms accessed by a pedestrian bridge. There are two principal station buildings with one located on each platform. These buildings are both single story and act as customer service, staff, and waiting room facilities. These buildings were provided in 1979 as part of a station rebuild. The station is fully accessible and comply with DDA accessibility guidelines.

Darling railway station is served by the Glen Waverley line, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station also connects to the route 624 bus service. The journey to Southern Cross railway station is approximately 12.68 kilometres (7.88 mi) and takes 29 minutes.

==Description==
Darling railway station is located in the suburb of Malvern East, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located nearby to the Malvern Road shopping precinct and Dorothy Laver Reserve West. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately 12.68 kilometres (7.88 mi), or a 29-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station. The adjacent stations are Glen Iris station up towards Melbourne, and East Malvern station down towards Glen Waverley. A crossover on the up side allows trains to reverse at this station in either direction.

The station consists of two side platforms with a total of two platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately 160 metres (524.93 ft) long, enough for a Metro Trains 7 car HCMT. The station features a pedestrian bridge, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp built in 1987. The station features two principal station buildings, one of each side of the platforms built in 1979. These buildings act as staff facilities and passenger waiting rooms, and are constructed with cream bricks and ribbed roofing panels.

The station building, platform, and overpass are largely the same as when it was rebuilt in 1979, with the main change being updated signage, technology, and more car parking. The station features 200 car-parks on the south side of the station. The station is listed as a &quot;fully accessible&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp adheres to DDA accessibility standards.

==History==

Darling railway station was opened on 24 March 1890, with the line through the station originally built to link Burnley to the Outer Circle line at Waverley Road, before continuing onto Oakleigh. The station was named after the former Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Henry Darling. The section of the line from Darling to Oakleigh station was closed on 9 December 1895, after 5 years of operation. The line was re-opened to Eastmalvern on 3 February 1929, with the line being extended further to Glen Waverley on 5 May 1930. In 1956, the line was duplicated, with three position signalling also provided. In 1974, the goods siding was closed after 59 years of operation since its opening in 1915.

The station was rebuilt in 1979 to coincide with the construction of the South Eastern Arterial link. This was the final station rebuild with the station buildings remaining almost the same into the 21st century. Until 1987, a level crossing was provided at Moira Street, located at the up end of the station. An overpass replaced the level crossing as part of the South Eastern Arterial link, built between Toorak and Warrigal Roads. Minor upgrades have occurred at the station since 1979, with the station being upgraded to a premium station in 2008 and a signal box located at Platform 1 being decommissioned on 8 June 2019.

==Platforms and services==
Darling has two side platforms with two faces. The station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line, a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Glen Waverley line runs from Glen Waverley station south east of Melbourne, joining the Belgrave, Lilydale, and Alamein lines at Burnley station, before travelling through the City Loop&quot;.&quot;

<text>East Malvern railway station is a commuter railway station on the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Malvern East, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. East Malvern station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 3 February 1929, with the current station provided in 1975.

The station was provisionally named Karnak. However, during construction, it was renamed to Eastmalvern.

Initially opened as Eastmalvern, the station was given its current name of East Malvern on 29 February 1972.

==History==
The first section of what later became the Glen Waverley line opened on 3 March 1890, as part of the Outer Circle railway connecting Burnley and Oakleigh stations. After the Outer Circle line from Oakleigh to Camberwell was closed on 9 December 1895, trains from Melbourne terminated at Darling.

East Malvern station opened on 3 February 1929 as a one-stop extension of the Darling line. The line was extended from East Malvern to Glen Waverley in the following year.

Until the 1950s there was a dock platform at the down end of Platform 1, which could accommodate trains of up to three cars. However, it was typically used by a single swing-door &quot;dogbox&quot; car, which ran a shuttle service between East Malvern and Glen Waverley, because most off-peak trains terminated at East Malvern. Every second or third train to East Malvern connected with the Glen Waverley shuttle. The dock platform was abolished in 1954 after the restructuring of services. Two years later, the line between East Malvern and Darling was duplicated, with duplication from East Malvern to Mount Waverley occurring in 1964.

The station was rebuilt in 1975 due to the construction of the adjacent South Eastern Arterial link.

Around that time, parcel facilities were abolished. 1988 saw the opening of a pedestrian overpass serving both platforms, as well as crossing what had become by then the Monash Freeway. As part of the freeway project, the line was rerouted through an artificial tunnel, and a timber trestle bridge crossing a local creek was replaced. East Malvern was upgraded to a premium station on 21 August 1995.

There have been some minor changes in the 21st century, with the footbridge being rebuilt in 2009 to accommodate the widening of the Monash Freeway, and the provision of a Parkiteer secure bike cage next to the entrance of Platform 1 in the 2010s.

==Description==
The station is close to the Waverley Road shopping precinct and Waverley Park. It is , or a 25-minute train journey, from Southern Cross station. The two platforms are approximately long, with asphalt surfaces and concrete edges.

The station building, platforms, and overpass remain largely as when they were rebuilt in 1975, with the main changes being updated signage and more car parking. There are now 675 car parks on the south side of the station. On the Metro Trains website, the station is described as &quot;assisted access&quot;, because the access ramp is too steep for wheelchair users to traverse on their own.

==Platforms and services==
East Malvern has two side platforms. It is served by Glen Waverley line trains.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Glen Waverley

==Transport links==
East Malvern station connects with the route 612 bus service from Box Hill station to Chadstone Shopping Centre. The nearest bus stop is 200 metres away, in Malvern Road, although rail replacement bus stops are located adjacent to the station.

Bus connections:
*: Box Hill station – Chadstone Shopping Centre

<text>Holmesglen railway station is a commuter railway station on the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Malvern East, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Holmesglen station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform. It opened on 5 May 1930, with the current station provided in 1964.

The station is directly connected via a walkway to the adjacent Chadstone Campus of Holmesglen Institute of TAFE, with which the station shares its name.

==History==

Holmesglen station opened on 5 May 1930, when the railway line from East Malvern was extended to Glen Waverley. It is named after the father of Malvern Council at the time of its opening, Councillor L. W. Holmes.

In 1964, the current island platform was provided, when the line between East Malvern and Mount Waverley was duplicated. On 17 December 1965, the rail bridge near the station was the crime scene of an infamous Melbourne murder.

During June and early July 1991, the station was patrolled 24 hours a day by the former Victoria Transit Patrol department, working in conjunction with local police, as part of the Public Transport Corporation &quot;Travel Safe&quot; program of the early 1990s.

On 26 July 2000, the station was the site of a collision involving two Comeng train sets.

On 4 May 2010, as part of the 2010/2011 State Budget, $83.7 million was allocated to upgrade Holmesglen to a premium station, along with nineteen others. However, in March 2011, this was scrapped by the Baillieu Government.

==Platforms and services==

Holmesglen has one island platform with two faces. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Glen Waverley line services.

Platform 1:
* all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Glen Waverley

==History==
Jordanville station opened on 5 May 1930, when the railway line from East Malvern was extended to Glen Waverley. The station was named after the Jordan family, mainly John Jordan, who was an early settler and shire councillor. The original name of the station, Kabbareng, is an Indigenous word meaning &quot;upper&quot;. The name was controversial, as evidenced by a letter sent to the editor of &quot;The Argus&quot;, on 4 March 1930, using the pseudonym &quot;Anti-Kabbareng&quot;. An article in &quot;The Age&quot;, on 21 March 1930, stated that: &quot;At the last meeting of the Mulgrave Council indignation was expressed at the name of Kabbareng being selected for the railway station at Box Hill-road on the new Darling-Glen Waverley line. The council&#x27;s recommendation was Jordan. It was decided to ask the district Parliamentary representatives to take up the matter in support of the name selected by the council.&quot;

In the 1950s, the level crossing was removed at Jordanville by moving the railway above Huntingdale road.

In 2014, Metro Trains Melbourne was forced to upgrade the track near Jordanville due to the poor maintenance of tracks.

<text>Syndal railway station is a commuter railway station on the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the south-eastern suburb of Glen Waverley, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Syndal station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring an island platform with two faces, connected to Hunter Street and Coleman Parade via a pedestrian subway. It opened on 5 May 1930, with the current station provided in 1964.

Additionally, the station is served by SmartBus route 703 and route 737. 

The station is approximately 21 kilometres (13 mi) or around a 33-minute train ride from Flinders Street.

==Description==

Syndal station is located in the suburb of Glen Waverley. On the north side of the station is Hunter Street and Coleman Parade is to the south. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne.

The length of the island platform is approximately , long enough for a Metro Trains 7-car HCMT. There is a single station building which primarily serves as a ticket office and waiting area.

The main car park at the station is located on Coleman Parade just south of the station. Although there are ramps, they do not fully comply with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, as the gradient of the ramps is steeper than the maximum of 1:14 allowed under the Act.

==History==

Syndal station opened on 5 May 1930, when the railway line from Easmalvern was extended to Glen Waverley. The station gets its name from a nearby property owned by Sir Redmond Barry, a major figure in the development of the area.

In 2015, the station was upgraded to include an additional 250 car parking spaces, with a new multi-deck car park, improved lighting, the installation of CCTV cameras, as well as enhanced pedestrian access. On 26 October of that year, the multi-deck car park officially opened. The four-story car park cost roughly $10.8 million. Although there were plans for a single-deck car park, they were largely opposed by the state government as it was not seen as cost effective.

===1989 train collision===
On 20 November 1989, the station was the site of a collision involving Hitachi and Comeng train sets. The incident occurred after the 07:49 train from Glen Waverley passed a red signal, and collided with the 07:46 train from Glen Waverley, at a speed of roughly 40 km/h. The collision impact resulted in the stationary train being pushed roughly . The 07:46 was stationary at Syndal due to a problem with the doors closing when the collision happened. 75 people were injured in the collision.

==Platforms and services==
The station is currently served by the Glen Waverley line, which is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne. Services to Glen Waverley travel east. Services to the city head to Burnley, joining the Alamein, Belgrave and Lilydale lines, before heading to Richmond and traveling through the City Loop in a clockwise direction&quot;.&quot;

<text>Glen Waverley railway station is a commuter railway station located in the suburb of Glen Waverley in the south-east of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station originally opened in 1930 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Eastmalvern. The station consists of a single island platform with two faces, that is connected to Kingsway via a ramp on the station&#x27;s eastern end.

Glen Waverley is the terminus of the Glen Waverley line, which is part of the Melbourne rail network. Additionally, the station is served by ten bus routes, including SmartBus route 902. The station is approximately or around a 35-minute train ride from Flinders Street station.

== Description ==
Glen Waverley is located in the suburb of Glen Waverley. On the north side of the station is Railway Parade, on the south side of the station is Coleman Parade and Kingsway is to the east. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne.

The length of the island platform is approximately , long enough for a Metro Trains 7-car High Capacity Metro Trains (HCMT). There is a single station building that primarily serves as a waiting room.

The main car park at the station is located on Railway Parade, just north of the station. Although there are ramps, they do not fully comply with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 as the gradient of the ramps is steeper than the maximum of 1:14 allowed under the Act.

==History==
Glen Waverley station opened on 5 May 1930, when the railway line was extended from Eastmalvern. Like the suburb itself, the station was named after a township which was privately surveyed in 1853. The owner named it after Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Waverley&quot;.

Upon opening, the station was located near the current day Springvale Road. In 1964, the station moved to its current site. The former station building was relocated to Epping, which became the terminus of the Epping line in November of that year. Also in that year, the line between Syndal and Glen Waverley was duplicated.

On 23 June 1979, a fire destroyed Tait motor carriage 339M whilst stabled in No. 4 road. The fire also damaged trailer carriage 407T and two stabled Hitachi sets.

On 16 August 1995, Glen Waverley was upgraded to a premium station.

In 2012, construction of the &quot;Ikon&quot; apartment complex began on the station site, as part of VicTrack&#x27;s station precinct enhancement program. The $70 million development was completed in 2013, with the proceeds being used to fund a $1.8 million upgrade to the station forecourt. Works were completed in mid-2014. The upgrade included a brand new station entrance, accessibility improvements and a new kiosk.

In 2018, the station was chosen to be one of the stops on the under-construction Suburban Rail Loop East. Early works on the project have already commenced in the suburb, with the line expect to open between Southland and Box Hill by 2035.

==Platforms and services==

<text>Lescott Kevin Lyttle Coombs (born 14 September 1976) is a Vincentian soca singer. He is best known for his 2003 hit single &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; which peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Career==
Lyttle was encouraged by his family to pursue music at the young age and has been performing at local events in his teens. Prior to his musical career, Lyttle had subsisted on day jobs, such as customs officer and radio disc jockey. Investing his savings of EC$1,500, Lyttle recorded &quot;Turn Me On&quot; as a soca ballad in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2001, and the song subsequently became a radio hit throughout the Caribbean.

Lyttle signed with Atlantic Records in 2003 and a remixed version of &quot;Turn Me On&quot; was officially released as a single in the UK at the end of the year, with dancehall pop artist Spragga Benz&#x27;s guest vocals. The song reached number two in the UK, spending seven weeks in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. It eventually became a worldwide hit in 2004, reaching number 4 in the United States, number 3 in Australia and placing within Top 5 in many European countries.

The debut self-titled album &quot;Kevin Lyttle&quot; followed in July 2004, charting within Top 10 in the US, where it was certified Gold, and meeting with a minor success in Europe. The second single, &quot;Last Drop&quot;, was released in markets outside the US, but didn&#x27;t manage to repeat the success of &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, becoming only a minor hit in Europe. &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; was released as the third single in autumn 2004, followed by a promotional only single &quot;I Got It&quot;. Both songs were commercial failures. In 2005, Lyttle released a new song in Jamaica only, &quot;Jimmy Johnny&quot;.

In 2007, along with Byron Lee and Arrow, he performed at the Cricket World Cup opening ceremony in Greenfield Stadium, Jamaica. The same year Kevin Lyttle founded his own record label, Tarakon Records. Lyttle&#x27;s second album, &quot;Fyah&quot;, was released by Tarakon and Universal Records in 2008, featuring a duet version of &quot;Turn Me On&quot; recorded with Alison Hinds and contributions from other artists. The title song was released as the first single and both the single and the album were unsuccessful in terms of commercial performance.

Lyttle released &quot;Anywhere&quot;, a collaboration single with Flo Rida in 2011, followed by &quot;Nobody Like U&quot;, accompanied by a remix contest. The music video featured model Tania Marie Caringi. His third studio album, &quot;I Love Carnival&quot;, was released in 2012, promoted by &quot;Wine and Go Down&quot; and the title song. 2013 saw the release of his new single, &quot;Bounce&quot;, followed by &quot;Feel So Good&quot;, a collaboration with Shaggy, in 2014.

In 2016, American electronic group Cheat Codes sampled Lyttle&#x27;s &quot;Turn Me On&quot; in a remix entitled &quot;Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)&quot;. The following year, American singer Chris Brown also sampled &quot;Turn Me On&quot; to make his song &quot;Questions&quot; in 2017.

==Personal life==
Born Lescott Kevin Lyttle Coombs in Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Lyttle now lives in Miami, Florida. He is married to Dr. Jacqueline James, with whom he has a son.

<text>Riversdale railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein line, which is part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern suburb of Camberwell, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Riversdale station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 30 May 1890.

The station was provisionally named as Prospect Hill. However, during construction, it was given the name &quot;Riversdale&quot;.

A number of services terminate at Riversdale after the morning and evening peaks and return to Camberwell for stabling.

==History==

Riversdale station opened on 30 May 1890, along with the first section of the Outer Circle line. Prior to opening, it was provisionally called Prospect Hill, however, it has been named Riversdale since it opened. The name derives from the nearby Riversdale Road, itself named by parliamentarian and local resident Matthew O&#x27;Grady. O&#x27;Grady named it after the fact that the road leads to the valley of the Yarra River.

Though it was closed for a year in 1897 and 1898, when the Outer Circle line closed, it reopened soon after due to a public outcry.

In 1915, the current down platform (Platform 2) was provided, as well as two goods sidings. In 1922, a siding for Camberwell Council was provided.

By 1948, the council siding was removed and, by 1953, all remaining sidings were abolished. On 31 July 1955, the line was duplicated to Hartwell and, on 29 November 1959, the line was duplicated to Camberwell. The duplication to Camberwell included a flyover for the down line, which crosses over the Belgrave and Lilydale lines, and the replacement of hand gates with boom barriers at the Prospect Hill Road level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station.

The level crossing at Riversdale Road, located at the down end of the station, features unusual manually-operated boom barriers, which are controlled by a signal box. The boom barrier arms are divided into two sections, so as not to make contact with the overhead tram wires. These boom barriers were provided in 1963, and replaced interlocked gates.

In 1972, both platforms were extended at the up end.

==Platforms and services==

Riversdale has two side platforms. It is serviced by Metro Trains&#x27; Alamein line services.

Platform 1:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Camberwell

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Alamein; terminating services

==Transport links==

CDC Melbourne operates one bus route via Riversdale station, under contract to Public Transport Victoria:
* : Box Hill station – Chadstone Shopping Centre

Yarra Trams operates one route via Riversdale station:
* : Docklands (Waterfront City) – Wattle Park

<text>Willison railway station is a commuter railway station on the Alamein line, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Camberwell in Victoria, Australia. Willison is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 8 June 1908, with the current station provided in 1954 and platforms in 1972.

Initially opened as Golf Links, the station was given its current name of Willison on 23 July 1936.

==History==
Willison station was not part of the original Outer Circle line. It was provided for the convenience of members of the Riversdale Golf Club, which was originally adjacent to the site. It has been said that influential club members did not appreciate having to walk to either Riversdale or Hartwell, and pressed for a closer alternative. That almost certainly explains why Willison was built so close to Riversdale, being only 400 metres away. The club moved from the site in 1927 and, on 23 July 1936, the station was renamed Willison, after A. J. Willison, a former member of Camberwell Council.

The station was originally served by the so-called &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot;, which ran a shuttle on the remnant of the Outer Circle line between Ashburton and Deepdene. After the &quot;Deepdene Dasher&quot; ceased operation in 1927, the station was served by Ashburton line trains. Twelve years later, on 28 June 1948, the line was extended from Ashburton to Alamein, the service which still exists today.

In 1954, the current station platforms were provided when the line was duplicated between Riversdale and Hartwell. In 1972, both platforms were extended at the down end, and a pedestrian crossing was relocated.

During the 2018/2019 financial year, Willison was the sixth-least-used station on Melbourne&#x27;s metropolitan network, with 102,600 passenger movements.

==Platforms and services==
Willison has two side platforms. It is served by Alamein line trains.

Platform 1:
* weekday all stations and limited express services to Flinders Street; all stations shuttle services to Camberwell

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Alamein

<doc id="707980" wikidata="Q357439" url="?curid=707980" title="Adiponectin">
<text>Adiponectin (also referred to as GBP-28, apM1, AdipoQ and Acrp30) is a protein hormone and adipokine, which is involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid breakdown. In humans, it is encoded by the &quot;ADIPOQ&quot; gene and is produced primarily in adipose tissue, but also in muscle and even in the brain.

== Structure ==
Adiponectin is a 244-amino-acid-long polypeptide (protein). It has four distinct regions: The first is a short signal sequence that targets the hormone for secretion outside the cell; next is a short region that varies between species; the third is a 65-amino acid region with similarity to collagenous proteins; the last is a globular domain. Overall, this protein shows similarity to the complement 1Q factors (C1Q), but when the three-dimensional structure of the globular region was determined, a striking similarity to TNFα was observed, despite unrelated protein sequences.

== Function ==
Adiponectin is a protein hormone that modulates a number of metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation. Adiponectin is secreted from adipose tissue (and also from the placenta in pregnancy) into the bloodstream and is very abundant in plasma relative to many hormones. High adiponectin levels correlate with a lower risk of diabetes mellitus type 2. Plasma levels of adiponectin are lower in obese subjects than in lean subjects. Many studies have found adiponectin to be inversely correlated with body mass index in patient populations. However, a meta analysis was not able to confirm this association in healthy adults. Circulating adiponectin concentrations increase during caloric restriction in animals and humans, such as in patients with anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that adipose tissue within bone marrow, which increases during caloric restriction, contributes to elevated circulating adiponectin in this context.

Transgenic mice with increased adiponectin show reduced adipocyte differentiation and increased energy expenditure associated with mitochondrial uncoupling. The hormone plays a role in the suppression of the metabolic derangements that may result in type 2 diabetes, obesity, atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin in combination with leptin has been shown to completely reverse insulin resistance in mice. Adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity primarily though regulation of fatty acid oxidation and suppression of hepatic glucose production .

Adiponectin is secreted into the bloodstream, where it accounts for about 0.01% of all plasma protein at around 5-10 μg/mL. In adults, plasma concentrations are higher in females than males, and are reduced in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. Weight reduction significantly increases circulating concentrations.

Adiponectin automatically self-associates into larger structures. Initially, three adiponectin molecules bind together to form a homotrimer. The trimers continue to self-associate and form hexamers or dodecamers. Like the plasma concentration, the relative levels of the higher-order structures are sexually dimorphic, where females have increased proportions of the high-molecular-weight forms. Recent studies showed that the high-molecular-weight form may be the most biologically active form regarding glucose homeostasis. High-molecular-weight adiponectin was further found to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes with similar magnitude of association as total adiponectin. However, coronary artery disease has been found to be positively associated with high molecular weight adiponectin, but not with low molecular weight adiponectin.

Adiponectin exerts some of its weight-reduction effects via the brain. This is similar to the action of leptin; adiponectin and leptin can act synergistically.

Adiponectin promoted synaptic and memory function in the brain. Humans with lower levels of adiponectin have reduced cognitive function.

== Receptors ==

Adiponectin binds to a number of receptors. So far, two receptors have been identified with homology to G protein-coupled receptors, and one receptor similar to the cadherin family:
* Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1)
* Adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2)
* T-cadherin - CDH13

These have distinct tissue specificities within the body and have different affinities to the various forms of adiponectin. AdipoR1 is enriched in skeletal muscle, whereas AdipoR2 is enriched in liver. Six months of exercise has been shown in rats to double muscle AdipoR1.

The receptors affect the downstream target AMP kinase, an important cellular metabolic rate control point. Expression of the receptors is correlated with insulin levels, as well as reduced in mouse models of diabetes, particularly in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.

In 2016, the University of Tokyo announced that it would launch an investigation into claims of fabrication of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 identification data, as accused by an anonymous person/group called Ordinary_researchers.

== Discovery ==
Adiponectin was first characterised in 1995 in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Scherer PE et al.). In 1996 it was characterised in mice as the mRNA transcript most highly expressed in adipocytes. In 2007, adiponectin was identified as a transcript highly expressed in preadipocytes (precursors of fat cells) differentiating into adipocytes.

The human homologue was identified as the most abundant transcript in adipose tissue. Contrary to expectations, despite being produced in adipose tissue, adiponectin was found to be decreased in obesity. This downregulation has not been fully explained. The gene was localised to chromosome 3q27, a region highlighted as affecting genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Supplementation by differing forms of adiponectin was able to improve insulin control, blood glucose and triglyceride levels in mouse models.

The gene was investigated for variants that predispose to type 2 diabetes. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region and surrounding sequence were identified from several different populations, with varying prevalences, degrees of association and strength of effect on type 2 diabetes. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has been shown to increase adiponectin expression, which partly explains its beneficial effects on metabolic disturbances. Mice fed the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have shown increased plasma adiponectin. Curcumin, capsaicin, gingerol, and catechins have also been found to increase adiponectin expression.

Phylogenetic distribution includes expression in birds and fish.

== Metabolic==

Adiponectin effects:

* glucose flux
** decreased gluconeogenesis
** increased glucose uptake
* lipid catabolism
** β-oxidation
** triglyceride clearance
* protection from endothelial dysfunction (important facet of atherosclerotic formation)
* insulin sensitivity
* weight loss
* control of energy metabolism.
* upregulation of uncoupling proteins
* reduction of TNF-alpha
* promotion of reverse cholesterol transport

Regulation of adiponectin
* Obesity is associated with decreased adiponectin.
**The exact mechanism of regulation is unknown, but adiponectin could be regulated by post-translational mechanisms in cells.

== Hypoadiponectinemia ==

A low level of adiponectin is an independent risk factor for developing:

*Metabolic syndrome
*Diabetes mellitus
*Dyslipidemia
*Obesity
*Hypertension

== Other ==

Lower levels of adiponectin are associated with ADHD in adults.

Adiponectin levels were found to be increased in rheumatoid arthritis patients responding to DMARDs or TNF inhibitor therapy.

A low adiponectin to leptin ratio has been found in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia compared to healthy controls.

Exercise induced release of adiponectin increased hippocampal growth and led to antidepressive symptoms in mice.

Several studies have found a positive correlation in caffeine consumption and increased adiponectin levels, although the mechanism for this is unknown and requires more research.

=== As a medication target ===
Circulating levels of adiponectin can indirectly be increased through lifestyle modifications and certain medications such as statins.

A small molecule adiponectin receptor AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 agonist, AdipoRon, has been reported. In 2016, the University of Tokyo announced it was launching an investigation into anonymously made claims of fabricated and falsified data on AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and AdipoRon.

Extracts of sweet potatoes have been reported to increase levels of adiponectin and thereby improve glycemic control in humans. However, a systematic review concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the consumption of sweet potatoes to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Adiponectin is apparently able to cross the blood-brain-barrier. However, conflicting data on this issue exist. Adiponectin has a half-life of 2.5 hours in humans.
