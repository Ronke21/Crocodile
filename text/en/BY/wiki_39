==Career==

===Early career===
Fielding&#x27;s first major role came in 1983 when she was cast in the children&#x27;s BBC series &quot;Seaview&quot;. The comedy-drama show centred around a teenage girl called Sandy Shelton (played by Fielding), growing up living at her parents&#x27; guest house in Blackpool. The show ran for two series. Fielding later made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;.

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot; and beyond===
In 1987, Fielding became a presenter on the BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. To date Fielding holds the record of being the youngest presenter on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, starting on 29 June 1987 three months before her 19th birthday. While on the series Fielding also had an acting role in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (making an appearance in the series while making a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; report on the show). During her time on the show, Fielding won the &quot;SOS Award&quot; for the &quot;Most Popular Woman on Television&quot;, competing with Cilla Black, Victoria Wood and Kylie Minogue.

Years after Fielding left &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, her trip on a rollercoaster with fellow presenter Mark Curry was voted the &quot;Favourite Blue Peter moment of all time&quot; by viewers. After five years of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Fielding co-hosted &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot;, a Saturday morning children&#x27;s show on ITV. The series ran for three years.

From 1995 Fielding made a transition from children&#x27;s television to broadcasting for an older audience. After leaving &quot;What&#x27;s Up Doc?&quot; Fielding presented &quot; The Heaven and Earth Show&quot;, &quot;The General&quot; and &quot;City Hospital&quot; for the BBC. She was a regular host of &quot;Karaoke Challenge&quot; and contributed weekend continuity for Challenge TV. Fielding also appeared in the ITV game show &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; in 1995 and 1996. Fielding briefly returned to children&#x27;s television in 1997, appearing in two episodes of the CBBC drama series &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, playing the role of Samantha Fuller.

In 2004, Fielding was named &#x27;Multichannel personality of the year&#x27; at the Variety Club Showbusiness awards. In 2005, Fielding appeared as Annie Lennox in a celebrity special of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;, and also appeared as a guest panellist on Channel 5 show &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; (Fielding made further guest appearances on the show in 2008 and 2009). Later in the same year she also made a guest appearance on the BBC music quiz show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

In 2007, Fielding appeared as a guest on the ITV chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot;, and appeared as a contestant in the ITV2 reality television programme &quot;Deadline&quot;, finishing second. Later on in the year she appeared as a guest on &quot;That Antony Cotton Show&quot;. In January 2008, Fielding appeared as a contestant on the BBC quiz show &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, with her specialist subject being Henry VIII.

Fielding and her husband were the celebrity subjects of a one-hour documentary for Living called &quot;Living With Yvette &amp; Karl&quot; which aired on 1 November 2008. A sequel documentary entitled &quot;In Bed with Yvette &amp; Karl&quot; which aired on Living on 17 January 2009, charted Fielding&#x27;s hysterectomy operation and recovery. A full-length series of &quot;In Bed with Yvette &amp; Karl&quot;, was then commissioned, and aired on Living during June and July 2009. In October 2009, a further documentary entitled &quot;Yvette &amp; Karl: Life begins at 40&quot; was broadcast. From February to March 2009, Fielding appeared in the ITV1 variety TV show &quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;.

===Presenting the paranormal===
In 2002, Yvette Fielding and her husband Karl Beattie established their own television production company, Antix Productions. Their first production was &quot;Most Haunted&quot; for the British TV channel Living. In the show, Fielding and paranormal experts investigate various supposedly haunted locations around Britain, in the hopes that paranormal activity may be documented by the crew. In 2006, Fielding presented and produced &quot;Ghosthunting With...&quot;, a paranormal show for ITV2 which shows Fielding leading various celebrities around haunted locations.

Fielding has made many appearances and interviews in the British media in connection with her paranormal investigations and programmes, including guest appearances on &quot;The Sunday Night Project&quot; (Channel 4), &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; (BBC Radio 1) and &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; (BBC One). Furthering her paranormal franchise, in 2008 Fielding made her first move into radio broadcasting, hosting &quot;Yvette Fielding&#x27;s Fright Nights&quot; on Kerrang! Radio. Fielding left the radio station a few months later however, due to other work commitments.

In 2008, Fielding and Beattie formed a new company called Monster Pictures to operate the Paranormal Channel. Fielding acted as anchor to the channel and presented original programming on the station. The channel was subsequently renamed the Unexplained Channel in 2009. In October 2009, a two-part documentary featuring Fielding with Paul O&#x27;Grady aired on Living entitled &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. The documentary saw the pair investigating claims of ghost and vampire sightings in Poveglia, Italy.

Fielding announced on 25 June 2010 that she was to step down as presenter of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. In subsequent interviews, Fielding also indicated that she would finish presenting &quot;Ghosthunting with..&quot; and all other paranormal-based broadcasts in 2010. However, in May 2011, Fielding appeared in an episode of the UK version of the &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; series for the bio channel, with the entire UK series of &quot;Celebrity Ghost Stories&quot; being produced by Fielding&#x27;s Antix Productions company. Then in September 2011 Fielding presented another episode of &quot;Ghosthunting with...&quot; featuring the cast of &quot;The Only Way Is Essex&quot;.

In April 2012, Fielding appeared in an episode of &quot;Olly: Life on Murs&quot;, in which she and Olly Murs visited a haunted house. In October 2012, Fielding appeared on BBC Radio 2 and &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; on ITV1 talking about the paranormal and her ghost hunting career. In these interviews Fielding stated that she will return to &quot;Most Haunted&quot; in 2013. In 2014, Fielding once again returned to hosting &quot;Most Haunted&quot;, when a new series was produced for the Freeview channel, Really.

In March 2013, Fielding appeared in the &quot;Peter Kay Sit down for Comic Relief&quot; comedy sketch as part of Red Nose Day 2013. In June 2013 she co-hosted Real Radio North West&#x27;s breakfast show, with Glen Hunt, as a stand in for the regular co-host, Lorna Bancroft.

As well as presenting &quot;Most Haunted&quot;, Fielding also ran and co-owned a tea shop in Manchester called &#x27;Propertea&#x27;, near to Manchester Cathedral until 2016 when she left to start her own tea shop.

In 2015, Fielding was a celebrity homeowner in an episode of &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;.

In November 2015, Fielding took part in the ITV reality series &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; She finished the show in tenth place after being evicted on 30 November.

<doc id="703968" wikidata="Q7330579" url="?curid=703968" title="Henrys Lake">
<text>Henrys Lake is a small, shallow alpine lake in the western United States, in eastern Idaho. Approximately in area, at in length and in width, its surface elevation is above sea level.

It is on the southwest side of the Henrys Lake Mountains of northern Fremont County, approximately two miles south of the continental divide along the Montana state line, just west of Targhee Pass and north of Sawtell Peak. The lake provides the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River. The lake lies less than across the continental divide from the headwaters of the Missouri River in southwestern Montana. It is due west of the western boundary of Yellowstone National Park, located in an enclave of Caribou-Targhee National Forest.

A dam built at the outlet of Henrys Lake in 1923 dramatically increased the surface area of the lake.

Springs are found around the shoreline at Staley Springs, Pintail Point, Kelly Springs, the Cliffs, and along the northshore of the lake. Inlets are found at Timber Creek, Targhee Creek, Howard Creek, Duck Creek, Hope Creek, and Kenny Creek.

==History==
The area surrounding Henrys Lake has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries. It was later seen by and named after Andrew Henry. During the Nez Perce War and following the Battle of Camas Creek near what is now Kilgore, the Nez Perce tribe proceeded eastward toward Yellowstone. After receiving word that the Nez Perce had entered the wilderness area, General Oliver O. Howard rested for several days on the side of the lake. To this point, Howards troops had marched every day for 26 days at an unusually quick pace.

Following the Russian invasion of Finland in 1939, the U.S. Army began construction of a training outpost to be called the West Yellowstone Winter Training Camp near Henrys Lake Station. Plans were created that included a 100,000 acre training area that could hold 30,000 personnel. Some buildings were constructed in 1941, but were ordered destroyed in 1942. At the time, the military offered no reasoning for the reversal of the plan. It was later discovered by an Ashton resident that the military did not want to interfere with trumpeter swans which used the lake as a breeding ground. The winter training program was relocated to Fort Drum in New York.

==Wildlife==
Henrys Lake is home to a variety of migrating birds. The western and eastern edges of the lake provide wetland/marsh habitats that serve as breeding areas for many birds in spring. Notable at Henrys Lake are white pelicans, widgeon, lesser scaup, cormorants, red-necked and western grebes, coots, mallards, bufflehead, ring-necked ducks, Canada geese, blue-winged teal, eared grebe, killdeer, common merganser, common tern, cinnamon teal, trumpeter swans, great blue heron, California seagulls, bald eagles, Swainson&#x27;s hawks, red-tailed hawks, red-winged blackbirds, cowbirds and more. The lake and the surrounding area is also home to a variety of mammals including moose, deer, black bear, grizzly bear, fox, and many others.

==Recreation==
Henrys Lake is a popular destination for sport fishing. The most common species in the lake is Yellowstone cutthroat. They make up 55 percent of the trout population. The average size in 2015 was 15 inches, with biologists finding some fish over 20 inches. The second most prevalent species is rainbow-cutthroat hybrids, which make up 24 percent of the population. The average size is 19 inches, although Idaho Fish and Game found hybrids longer than 25 inches. Brook trout make up 21 percent of the population. The average length is 16 inches, with biologists finding several brook trout that exceeded 20 inches in length. There is a fish hatchery on the north side of the lake that helps to replenish the lake.

; Recreational access
On the south shore on the lake, Henrys Lake State Park is a 585-acre state park off of U.S. 20 near Goose Bay and the Henrys Lake Outlet with hiking trails, camping facilities and boat ramp. Frome Park on the west shore of Henrys Lake is owned and operated by Fremont County. The park&#x27;s limited facilities include a boat ramp and campsites, both of which are free. The South Shore Boat Access offers a boat ramp, primitive camping, fishing, and platform for wildlife viewing.

The Continental Divide Trail skirts around Henry&#x27;s Lake. Many northbound through hikers opt out of this section when leaving Yellowstone National Park and entering the Centennial Mountain Range in Idaho.

<doc id="703970" wikidata="Q464042" url="?curid=703970" title="Anaconda (1997 film)">
<text>Anaconda is a 1997 Brazilian-American action adventure horror film directed by Luis Llosa and starring Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, and Owen Wilson. It focuses on a documentary film crew in the Amazon rainforest that is led by a snake hunter who is hunting down a giant, legendary green anaconda. The film received generally mixed-to-negative reviews, but was a box office success, and has become a cult classic. It was followed by a series of films.

==Plot==
On the Amazon River, a poacher hides from an unknown creature in his boat. While it breaks through the boat and attempts to catch the poacher, he commits suicide by shooting himself to prevent it from killing him.

Meanwhile, a film crew is shooting a documentary about the Shirishamas, a long-lost indigenous Amazonian tribe. The crew includes director Terri Flores, cameraman and childhood friend Danny Rich, production manager Denise Kalberg, Denise&#x27;s boyfriend and sound engineer Gary Dixon, narrator Warren Westridge, anthropologist Professor Steven Cale, and boat skipper Mateo. The group encounters stranded Paraguayan snake hunter Paul Serone, who convinces them he can help them find the Shirishamas. Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times about Shirishama lore. Eventually, Cale is stung by a wasp, and an allergic reaction swells up his throat and leaves him unconscious. Serone performs an emergency cricothyrotomy, seemingly saving Cale&#x27;s life, but soon after takes over the boat, forcing the crew to help him achieve his true goal: hunting down a giant record-breaking green anaconda he had been tracking, which he believes that he can capture alive.

Danny, Mateo and Serone search the wreckage of the poacher&#x27;s boat. A photograph in an old newspaper reveals that Mateo, Serone, and the poacher were working together to hunt animals, including snakes. Leaving the poacher&#x27;s ship, Mateo falls into the water, where the giant male warrior anaconda, measuring , attacks and kills him, while Danny and Serone return to their boat, unaware of Mateo&#x27;s fate. Serone promises that if the crew helps him find the snake, he will help them get out alive. That night, the anaconda attacks the boat crew. Serone attempts to capture the snake, but it coils around Gary, crushing him. Terri attempts to shoot the anaconda to save him, but Serone prevents her and the snake devours Gary, leaving Denise devastated. The crew overpowers Serone and ties him up as punishment.

The next day, the boat becomes stuck at a waterfall, requiring Terri, Danny, and Westridge to enter the water to winch it loose. Denise confronts Serone and attempts to kill him to avenge Gary&#x27;s death, but he strangles her with his legs before dumping her corpse into the river. The anaconda returns, and Westridge distracts it long enough for Terri and Danny to return to the boat while Westridge ascends the waterfall. Serone breaks free during the attack and attacks Danny. The anaconda climbs a tree and attacks Westridge, but the tree snaps. The crew winds up in the water, Cale wakes up in the process, and Westridge is killed in the fall from the waterfall. The snake attacks Danny, but Terri shoots it in the head. Serone, still believing he can capture the snake alive, attacks her. Cale stabs him with a tranquilizer dart before losing consciousness again himself, and Danny knocks Serone into the river.

Serone eventually catches up to the group and captures Terri and Danny, dumping a bucket of animal blood on them and using them as bait for a second, much larger female Queen anaconda, measuring . The snake attacks the pair, slowly suffocating them. Serone attempts to catch the anaconda in a net, but it breaks free and attacks him, eventually swallowing him whole, while Terri and Danny watch as they escape their bonds. The anaconda gives chase to Terri, who retreats into the building and finds a nest full of newborn anacondas. The snake regurgitates the still-alive, but partially digested Serone and chases her up a smokestack. Danny pins its tail to the ground with a pickaxe and ignites a fire below the smoke shack, setting the snake on fire. The resulting explosion sends the burning anaconda flying out of the building and into the water. As Terri and Danny recuperate on a nearby dock, the anaconda resurfaces, but Danny kills it with an axe to the head.

Afterward, the pair reunites with Cale, who begins recuperating on the boat. While floating downriver, the trio locates the Shirishama tribe they were originally seeking and, realizing Serone was right, begins filming their documentary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at No. 1 with $16.6 million in its first weekend and remained at the top spot in its following week. In total, &quot;Anaconda&quot; went on to gross $136.8 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Anaconda&quot; received generally mixed-to-negative reviews upon its release. Some critics did praise the film&#x27;s effects, scenery, and tongue-in-cheek humor, but many criticized the acting, &quot;forgettable&quot; or &quot;cardboard&quot; characters, inaccuracies, and &quot;boring&quot; start. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 41% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 5.00/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Anaconda&quot;″s pulpy pleasures are constricted by its own absurdity, but creature feature fans may enjoy its brazen silliness.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film a mixed 2 out of a possible 4 stars, criticizing the film&#x27;s &quot;hokey&quot; special effects and &quot;expositionless&quot; script but complimented the film&#x27;s use of Brazilian locale and Voight&#x27;s campy performance. Roger Ebert awarded the film out of 4 stars and called it a &quot;slick, scary, funny Creature Feature, beautifully photographed and splendidly acted in high adventure style&quot;.

Despite the initial negative reception, &quot;Anaconda&quot; has since become a cult classic, often viewed as being so-bad-it&#x27;s-good. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for six Razzie Awards in 1998 including Worst Picture (which lost to &quot;The Postman&quot;), Worst Actor (Jon Voight; which went to Kevin Costner for &quot;The Postman&quot;), Worst Director (awarded to Costner for &quot;The Postman&quot;), Worst Screenplay (lost to &quot;The Postman&quot;), Worst New Star (&quot;the animatronic anaconda&quot;; which went to Dennis Rodman for &quot;Double Team&quot;) and Worst Screen Couple (Voight and &quot;the animatronic anaconda&quot;; where they lost to Rodman and Jean-Claude Van Damme for &quot;Double Team&quot;). It was also nominated for two Saturn Awards including Best Actress (Jennifer Lopez; who lost to Jodie Foster for &quot;Contact&quot;) and Best Horror Film (which went to &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;). It won two Stinkers Awards including Worst Supporting Actor and Worst Fake Accent for Jon Voight (who also won the latter award for &quot;Most Wanted&quot;).

===Legacy===
The broadcast of the movie during primetime viewing on South African television station e.tv has become a national running gag, with the station airing the movie several times every year since the mid-2000s.

==Sequels and crossover==

A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released to theaters in 2004. Three more films follows with a direct-to-video release, &quot;Anaconda 3: Offspring&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot; (2009) and &quot;Lake Placid vs. Anaconda&quot; (2015), a crossover film with the &quot;Lake Placid&quot; franchise.

Even though no characters from the first film appear in the sequels, the events of the first film are referenced by the character Cole Burris in the second film, when he says he knows a man (Dr. Steven Cale) and another man (Danny Rich) that took a crew down to the Amazon, where they were attacked by snakes; in &quot;Lake Placid vs. Anaconda&quot;, character Will &quot;Tully&quot; Tull describes the same incident of the snakes in the Amazon to Reba, without explicitly mentioning the characters.

===Remake===
On March 1, 2024, a Chinese-produced remake was released.

===Reboot===

In January 2020, Sony Pictures announced a reboot is in development and screenwriter Evan Daugherty was hired to write the reboot film. In 2023, Tom Gormican was announced to direct the film. In August 2024, Variety reported that Jack Black and Paul Rudd were in early talks to star in the film, which was said to focus on a group of friends who seek to remake the original 1997 film. Gormican would also co-write with Kevin Etten. Brad Fuller and Andrew Form would produce through their Fully Formed Entertainment company. Daniela Melchior joined the cast a month later.

<doc id="703971" wikidata="Q243960" url="?curid=703971" title="Mythopoeic Awards">
<text>The Mythopoeic Awards for literature and literary studies are given annually for outstanding works in the fields of myth, fantasy, and the scholarly study of these areas.
Established by the Mythopoeic Society in 1971, the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award is given for &quot;fiction in the spirit of the Inklings&quot;, and the Scholarship Award for non-fiction work. The award is a statuette of a seated lion, with a plaque on the base. It has drawn resemblance to, and is often called, the &quot;Aslan&quot;.

The Mythopoeic Award is one of the &quot;principal annual awards&quot; for fantasy according to critic Brian Stableford. From 1971 to 1991, there was one award per category, annual but not always awarded before 1981. Dual awards in each category were established in 1992: Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards for Adult Literature and Children&#x27;s Literature; Scholarship Awards in Inklings Studies, and Myth and Fantasy Studies. In 2010, a Student Paper Award was introduced for the best paper presented at Mythcon by an undergraduate or graduate student; it was renamed the Alexei Kondratiev Award several months after its creation.

The 2023 winners were announced virtually at the Mythopoeic Society&#x27;s Online Midsummer Seminar 2023.

== Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards ==

In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="703972" wikidata="Q885924" url="?curid=703972" title="George Washington Glick">
<text>George Washington Glick (July 4, 1827 – April 13, 1911) was the ninth governor of Kansas.

George Washington Glick was raised on his father&#x27;s farm near Greencastle, Ohio. He enlisted for service in the Mexican–American War, but saw no action. At age 21 he began studying to become an attorney at the law offices of Buckland and Hayes (later President Rutherford B. Hayes); he was admitted to the bar two years later and established a moderate law practice, earning a reputation as a hard-working lawyer. Glick moved to Atchison, Kansas, in 1859 and formed a partnership with Alfred G. Otis. He served as a Union soldier in the 2nd Kansas Infantry during the Civil War. Elected to the Kansas State Legislature in 1862, he served for 14 of the next 18 years and was Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; in 1876. He served in both houses of the state legislature. Glick was well respected and considered &quot;just and expert&quot; by his colleagues.

He was elected Governor in 1882 and served until 1885. He was also, despite being the 9th governor overall, only the first Democrat to serve as governor of Kansas. Legislation enacted during his tenure included the creation of a railroad commission, a &quot;good roads&quot; law, reassessment of tax laws, and the establishment of a livestock sanitary commission. He was later appointed pension agent in Topeka by President Grover Cleveland.

After 15 years of civic service, George Glick was forced to abandon his political career because of a throat infection that nearly destroyed his ability to speak. He continued, however, as an attorney for various railroads. He also managed his farm and served as a charter member and first vice president of the Kansas Historical Society.

In 1900, he was nominated to run for the US Congress against Charles Curtis. Curtis, a very popular figure who had just authored the Gold Standard Act, won.

Glick died in 1911 in Atchison, Kansas.

==Statue replacement==
In 1914, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Glick to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection as one of its two allowed entries. The statue was sculpted by Charles Niehaus, who sculpted seven other statues for the collection, including Kansas&#x27;s other entry, Senator John J. Ingalls in 1905. In 2003, Kansas became the first state to replace a statue when it replaced Glick with a bronze of former president Dwight D. Eisenhower. Glick&#x27;s statue was moved to the Kansas History Center in Topeka.

In 2024, the statue was moved to the Atchison County Historical Museum.

<doc id="703986" wikidata="Q3487121" url="?curid=703986" title="Snake Plissken">
<text>S. D. Bob &quot;Snake&quot; Plissken is a fictional character who served as the protagonist of the films &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981) and &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996). Portrayed by Kurt Russell, the character was created by John Carpenter and Nick Castle. An antihero, Plissken is a former U.S. Green Berets lieutenant who served in the Soviet Union during World War III, for which he was awarded two Purple Hearts, before turning to a life of crime. In both movies, Plissken is approached by U.S. federal officials, who offers to pardon him if he agrees to perform dangerous missions in New York City and Los Angeles, both of which have been transformed into maximum security penal colonies to contain the criminals that have arisen from the massive increase in crime. The character went on to appear in &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot;, a four-part comic book miniseries released in 2003, and has frequently been referenced in popular culture.

S. D. Bob &quot;Snake&quot; Plissken was a former U.S. Green Berets lieutenant who served in the &quot;Black Blight&quot; unit. He was deployed to the Soviet Union as part of World War III between a Sino-Soviet alliance and the United States, where his actions in (then-named) Leningrad and Siberia resulted in him being awarded two Purple Hearts; at the time, he was the youngest serviceman to be decorated by the president of the United States for bravery. Plissken was subsequently discharged from the military and turned to a life of crime, in part due to his belief that he was betrayed by the federal government of the United States during a &quot;ruse de guerre&quot; in Leningrad which caused him to lose the use of his left eye and the death of Plissken&#x27;s parents at the hands of the police as part of a failed hostage rescue attempt.

He traveled with his war buddy and only friend, Bill Taylor. Snake took up with partners Harold Hellman (later known as &quot;Brain&quot;) and Bob (&#x27;Fresno Bob&#x27;). In Kansas City around 1993, Hellman apparently let Plissken and Fresno Bob be cornered by police, at which time Fresno Bob was brutally tortured and killed by the police.

After his daring escape from New York, Plissken finds himself in Cleveland, where he meets two new partners in crime — Jack &quot;Carjack&quot; Malone (later known as Hershe Las Palmas) and Mike &quot;Texas Mike&quot; O&#x27;Shay. Subsequently, Texas Mike is killed and Carjack is caught. Plissken evades capture and makes his way to the United States territory of New Vegas, Thailand, where he becomes a gunfighter-for-hire. He is eventually apprehended by the United States Police Force and brought to California, where he is scheduled for deportation to Los Angeles ― now an island due to the flooding of the San Fernando Valley in an earthquake, and a place of exile for criminals and undesirables.

As a result of the Kansas City incident, it was widely believed in the criminal community that Plissken is dead. This is a running gag in &quot;Escape from New York&quot;: &quot;I heard you were dead&quot; (homage to the John Wayne film &quot;Big Jake&quot;). In &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, the recurring joke is changed to &quot;I thought you&#x27;d be taller.&quot;

Plissken has a tattoo of a cobra on his abdomen. He is skilled in martial arts due to his military training.

===Personality===
Snake is shown as being very cynical, most likely due to the hypocrisy of the U.S. government, and appears to be willing to do anything to survive. He is often stated by others to be somewhat of a misanthrope. He is terse, stern in his speech, of few words, and holds nothing sacred or even important. He does however hold a loose code of honor.

He frequently shows coolness and level-headed thinking under extremely stressful situations. Although he will kill without remorse or hesitation, he does not kill for fun or when it is unnecessary. He is also known for his quick wit and gallows humor.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Escape from New York&quot;===
Snake was arrested in 1997 after breaking into the U.S. Federal Reserve in Denver, Colorado. He was sentenced to life in New York maximum security prison, that is, the entire island of Manhattan, surrounded by an impenetrable wall, and then abandoned to fall into anarchy. At this time, Air Force One is hijacked and crashes into Manhattan, and the President, played by Donald Pleasence, is captured by the &quot;Duke of New York&quot; (Isaac Hayes), the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the prisoners. Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), the United States Police Force Commissioner, offers Snake a full pardon if he will go in and rescue the President. The President carries technical information that would allow the United States to be the dominant world power, but in 24 hours it will become useless. Hauk enforces the time limit by implanting microscopic explosive capsules in Plissken&#x27;s carotid arteries, which will detonate at the deadline. Plissken rescues the President with the help of Harold Hellman (Harry Dean Stanton) (now known as Brain, and working for the Duke of New York), Brain&#x27;s &quot;squeeze&quot; Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau), and a taxicab driver nicknamed Cabby (Ernest Borgnine). Only Plissken and the President survive their escape. As the President begins his broadcast speech, Plissken, who is disgusted by the President&#x27;s evident lack of empathy for the people who died to get him out, walks away, furiously shredding the time-critical information tape.

===&quot;The Adventures of Snake Plissken&quot;===
In January 1997, Marvel Comics released the one-shot &quot;The Adventures of Snake Plissken&quot;. The story takes place sometime between &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; Snake has robbed the Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal&#x27;s every move. The robot&#x27;s first test subject is America&#x27;s public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, &quot;Why?&quot; Snake just walks off answering, &quot;I don&#x27;t need the competition&quot;.

===&quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot;===

Snake Plissken appeared in &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot;, a four-part comic book miniseries released in 2003 that was published by CrossGen comics and Hurricane Entertainment. The story takes place the morning after the events in &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Snake has been given a military Humvee after his pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Despite the fact the director&#x27;s cut of the New York movie shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was preplanned before his capture. The job is stealing the car JFK was assassinated in from a casino and then delivering it to a buyer on a yacht in the gulf. The job involves Snake&#x27;s partnership with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is luckily saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron. When Ron denies Snake&#x27;s request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. But when he ends up saving Ron from a Russian mob wanting money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face to face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shoot-out. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer&#x27;s yacht with Ron&#x27;s boat and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the fire fight the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job. The series is written by William O&#x27;Neill, penciled by Tone Rodriguez and edited by Jan Utstein-O&#x27;Neill.

===&quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;===
Sixteen years after his escape from New York, Snake is once again enlisted for a similar situation, as the story begins with a similar plotline as was used in &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. This time, Snake is forced to retrieve a disk for a remote control which controls a series of EMP-style satellites. These devices are positioned around the entire world. The disk is somewhere in Los Angeles. The city had separated from the mainland due to an earthquake in August 2000 and had become an island separate from the United States, which had become a totalitarian theocratic police state. Snake had to retrieve a black box, with which the new President&#x27;s (Cliff Robertson) daughter, Utopia (A.J. Langer), had entered Los Angeles. The President clearly states he does not care if she is returned or killed, as she is a traitor to his country. Snake initially refuses, but once infected with the plutoxin-7 virus, which will lead to his death in 10 hours, he agrees. Snake retrieves the box and seemingly returns it to the President. However, when the President attempts to activate it, he learns it is not the real box. Snake reveals that he switched the box with a fake, and promptly uses the code &quot;666&quot; to &quot;wipe out all technology&quot; in the world.

==Cancelled projects==
===Television series===
In July 2000, Tribune Entertainment announced plans to adapt &quot;Escape from New York&quot; into a television series. However, it was canceled in September 2001, due to the September 11 attacks in New York.

===Chronicles project===
Along with the comic book, other &quot;Snake Plissken Chronicles&quot; projects were announced. A Namco-produced video game was announced, but was later cancelled possibly due to the death of Debra Hill. Production I.G was also set to create an anime film based on the property, reportedly based on the &quot;Escape From Earth&quot; concept by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, but this also never materialized. Carpenter and Russell would have executive produced, and Russell would have provided the voice and likeness of Snake.

===&quot;Escape from Earth&quot;===
In the 2000s, there was a proposed second sequel, often mentioned by Carpenter and Russell in interviews prior to the release of &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; The concept was that Earth was the only place left for Plissken to escape. After &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; failed to attract much business, the project never materialized.

In August 2006, an Internet rumor suggested that the project was actively being pursued by Paramount at Russell&#x27;s urging, but the rumor was revealed to be untrue.

===&quot;Escape from Mars&quot;===
It was rumored that in 1996, the script to &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; originally started off as a potential Snake Plissken sequel. Entitled &quot;Escape from Mars&quot;, the story would have been largely much the same; however, after &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; failed to make much money at the box office, the studio did not wish to make another Plissken movie. Snake Plissken was then changed to &quot;Desolation Williams,&quot; and the studio also insisted that Ice Cube be given the part. Years later, a tweet confirmed that the rumor was false, and &quot;Ghost of Mars&quot; was never intended as a sequel.

==Possible future appearances==
On March 13, 2007, it was announced that Gerard Butler would play the role of Snake Plissken in a remake of &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Kurt Russell, as well as many fans, did not approve.

In June 2008, a rumor circulated that the project was proceeding with Josh Brolin as Snake Plissken. However, the project ended up in development hell. On October 12, 2015, 20th Century Fox hired Luther creator Neil Cross to write the film&#x27;s script. In March 2017, it was announced that Robert Rodriguez will direct the movie. In February 2019, new development surfaced when Leigh Whannell was hired to write a new script, with the option to replace Rodriguez as director.

==References in other media==
*In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, Solid Snake uses the alias &quot;Iroquois Pliskin&quot; upon meeting Raiden for the first time. Solid Snake&#x27;s character was also heavily inspired by Snake Plissken. Kurt Russell was reportedly offered the role of Naked Snake (Solid Snake&#x27;s genetic progenitor, also known as Big Boss) during the development of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, but Russell apparently declined. Carpenter retroactively gave his blessing to Kojima for the adaptation of the character.
*In the video game &quot;Bubsy 3D&quot;, the character Bubsy shows up dressed like Snake Plissken in one scene.
*The video game &quot;Broforce&quot; includes the playable character Snake Broskin, referencing Plissken.

<text>Mary Stuart Masterson (born June 28, 1966) is an American actress and director. After making her acting debut as a child in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975), Masterson took a ten-year hiatus to focus on her education. Her early film roles include &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (1985), &quot;At Close Range&quot; (1986), &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987), and &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989). Her performance in the film &quot;Immediate Family&quot; (1989) won her the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress, and she earned additional praise for her roles in &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991) and &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; (1993). 

Masterson later shifted her focus to television projects, appearing in &quot;Kate Brasher&quot; (2001) which she also produced, &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot; (2004), &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2004–2007), &quot;Mercy&quot; (2010), &quot;NCIS&quot; (2017), &quot;Blindspot&quot; (2017–2019), and &quot;For Life&quot; (2020). She also performed in the Broadway revival of &quot;Nine&quot; (2003) for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and directed &quot;The Cake Eaters&quot; (2007). She returned to mainstream film with &quot;As You Are&quot; (2017), and has since appeared in &quot;Skin&quot; (2018), &quot;Daniel Isn&#x27;t Real&quot; (2019), and &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Masterson was born June 28, 1966, in Los Angeles, California, to writer-director-actor-producer Peter Masterson and singer-actress Carlin Glynn. She has two siblings: Peter Jr., and Alexandra.

As a teenager, she attended Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York with actors Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Cryer. Later, she attended schools in New York, including eight months studying anthropology at New York University.

==Career==

Masterson&#x27;s first film appearance was in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975) at the age of eight, playing a daughter to her real-life father. Rather than continue her career as a child actor, she chose to continue her studies, although she did appear in several productions at the Dalton School.

In 1985, she returned to cinema in &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; as Danni, a courageous teen running the soda shop of her gravely depressed father. She appeared with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken in the film &quot;At Close Range&quot; (1986) as Brad Jr.&#x27;s girlfriend Terry, a film based on an actual rural Pennsylvania crime family led by Bruce Johnston Sr. during the 1960s and 1970s. She later starred as the tomboyish drummer Watts in the teenage drama &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (1987). .

That same year, Francis Ford Coppola cast her in &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; in which she acted with her parents who were hired by Coppola to play her on-screen parents. In 1989, she played in &quot;Chances Are&quot; alongside Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Robert Downey Jr., and she starred as Lucy Moore, a teenage girl giving up her first baby to a wealthy couple, played by Glenn Close and James Woods in &quot;Immediate Family&quot;. For her work in the latter, she won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Masterson continued acting in films and television during the 1990s. In 1991, she starred in &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, a film based on the novel &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe&quot;. The film was well-received, with film critic Roger Ebert applauding Masterson&#x27;s work. The following year she was invited to host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1993, she played opposite Johnny Depp in &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; as Joon, his mentally ill love interest. In May 1993, Masterson revealed she had written a screenplay for a film tentatively entitled &quot;Around the Block&quot;, a romantic comedy about a &quot;woman who conquers her fears by becoming a singer&quot;; in a cover story about &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot;″s box office success, she told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; she was going to direct it herself, with principal photography expected that autumn.

In 1994, she acted in &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, playing Anita Crown, a former prostitute, who joins with three other former prostitutes (played by Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore) in traveling the Old West. In 1996, Masterson acted alongside Christian Slater in the romantic drama &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;.

Although Masterson carried on her work in the film industry, by 2000 she had made a move towards television. In 2001, she began her directing career with a segment titled &quot;The Other Side&quot; in the television movie &quot;On the Edge&quot;. In 2001, she produced her own television series, &quot;Kate Brasher&quot;, which was canceled by CBS after six episodes. In 2004, Masterson played Dr. Helen Taussig in the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning HBO biographical drama &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;.

Masterson has appeared in Broadway theater productions, and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical in the Maury Yeston musical &quot;Nine: The Musical&quot;, directed by David Leveaux. Between 2004 and 2007, she made five guest starring appearances on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as Dr. Rebecca Hendrix. A decade later, she appeared in a recurring role as FBI director Eleanor Hirst in the second and third seasons of &quot;Blindspot&quot;. In 2020, she appeared in a starring role in the first season of the legal drama &quot;For Life&quot;. In 2023, she appeared in &quot;Five Nights At Freddy&#x27;s&quot;.

Masterson has narrated several audiobooks, including &quot;I See You Everywhere&quot; by Julia Glass, &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; by Patricia Cornwell, &quot;The Quickie&quot; by James Patterson and &quot;Look Again&quot; by Lisa Scottoline.

Masterson made her feature film directorial debut in 2007, with &quot;The Cake Eaters&quot;, which premiered at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival as well as the Ashland Independent Film Festival where it received the &#x27;Audience Award – Dramatic Feature&#x27; prize in 2008. Of her move to directing, Masterson said in an interview, &quot;When I signed to do this, I wasn&#x27;t scared but, yes, it was scary. I&#x27;m already 40, although we don&#x27;t want to talk about that. In &#x27;92, I wrote my first screenplay, which I then was to direct, but I ended up taking an acting job because it takes forever to get a movie made.&quot;

==Personal life==
Masterson was married to George Carl Francisco from 1990 to 1992 and to filmmaker Damon Santostefano from 2000 to 2004. In 2006, Masterson married actor Jeremy Davidson after they starred together in the 2004 stage production of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;. In October 2009, Masterson gave birth to their first child, son Phineas Bee. She gave birth to twins in August 2011, son Wilder and daughter Clio, and she had a fourth child in October 2013.

<text>Presuppositional apologetics, shortened to presuppositionalism, is an epistemological school of Christian apologetics that examines the presuppositions on which worldviews are based, and invites comparison and contrast between the results of those presuppositions.

It claims that apart from presuppositions, one could not make sense of any human experience, and there can be no set of neutral assumptions from which to reason with a non-Christian. Presuppositionalists claim that Christians cannot consistently declare their belief in the necessary existence of the God of the Bible and simultaneously argue on the basis of a different set of assumptions that God may not exist and Biblical revelation may not be true. Two schools of presuppositionalism exist, based on the different teachings of Cornelius Van Til and Gordon Haddon Clark. Presuppositionalism contrasts with classical apologetics and evidential apologetics.

Presuppositionalists compare their presupposition against other ultimate standards such as reason, empirical experience, and subjective feeling, claiming presupposition in this context is:
==Comparison with other schools of apologetics==
Presuppositionalists contrast their approach with the other schools of Christian apologetics by describing the others as assuming that the world is intelligible apart from belief in the existence of God and then arguing on purportedly neutral grounds to support trusting the Christian scriptures and the existence of God. Specifically, presuppositionalists describe Thomistic (also &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;classical&quot;) apologetics as concentrating on the first aspect of apologetics with its logical proofs for the existence of God, simply assuming common ground with the non-Christian and using a piece-by-piece methodology. In this scheme, the common foundation of neutral brute facts leads to a generic concept of deity, then to the various characteristics of the Christian God as revealed in Scripture, and so forth. Piece-by-piece, Christian theology is built up from a neutral common ground.

Presuppositionalists assert that many of the classical arguments are logically fallacious, or do not prove enough, when used as arguments to prove the existence or character of God. They criticize both the assumption of neutrality and the &quot;block house&quot; or &quot;piecemeal&quot; method for failing to start at the level of the controlling beliefs of worldviews and implicitly allowing non-Christian assumptions from the start, thereby trying to build a Christian &quot;house&quot; on a non-Christian &quot;foundation&quot;. Evidentialists demur from this assessment, claiming that presuppositionalism amounts to fideism because it rejects the idea of shared points of reference between the Christian and non-Christian from which they may reason in common.

The conclusion of evidential apologetics is that the Bible&#x27;s historical accounts and other truth-claims are more probably true than false, thus the whole of scriptural revelation may be rationally accepted, and where we can&#x27;t approach absolute certainty we must accept the explanations most likely to be true. The goal of presuppositional apologetics, on the other hand, is to argue that the assumptions and actions of non-Christians require them to believe certain things about God, man, and the world which they claim not to believe. This type of argument is technically called a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; in that it attempts to reduce the opposition to holding an absurd, i.e., self-contradictory position; in this case, both believing in facts of Christian revelation (in practice) and denying them (in word). So, in essence, evidential apologetics attempts to build upon a shared acceptance of self-evident or worldview-neutral facts, while presuppositional apologetics attempts to claim all facts for the Christian worldview as the only framework in which they are intelligible.

Another way presuppositionalism has been developed is by first presupposing reason as the laws of thought (common to all thinkers), then critically examining beliefs for meaning, and finally constructing a coherent worldview from the ground up. This way of arguing has been called Rational Presuppositionalism. They postulate that thinking (or reasoning) is presuppositional in that we think of the less basic things, like the nature of man, in light of the more basic things, the existence or non-existence of God. How we view mankind&#x27;s purpose and destiny depends on our assumption about man&#x27;s origin. Philosopher Surrendra Gangadean (1943–2022) opened his book &quot;Philosophical Foundation: A Critical Analysis of Basic Beliefs&quot; by stating the following. “Some things are clear. The basic things are clear. The basic things about God and man and good and evil are clear to reason.” He argues step by step from knowledge is possible to the existence of God to the Good for man as knowledge of the eternal Creator.

==History==
The modern origins of presuppositional apologetics are in the work of Dutch theologian Cornelius Van Til, a member of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, who began to adopt a presuppositional approach to defending his belief in the truth of his faith as early as the late 1920s. Van Til personally disliked the term &quot;presuppositional&quot;, as he felt it misrepresented his approach to apologetics, which he felt was focused primarily on the preeminence of the Bible as the ultimate criterion for truth, rather than denying or ignoring evidence. He did, however, accept the label reluctantly, given that it was a useful way of distinguishing between those who deny a neutral basis for apologetics and those who do not. His student, Greg Bahnsen, aided in some of the later developments of Van Tillian Presuppositionalism, and the Bahnsen Theological Seminary continues to promote presuppositional apologetics in its curriculum. John Frame, another student of Van Til, also continues to advocate a presuppositional approach, although he is generally more critical of Van Til&#x27;s thought than Bahnsen was. Bahnsen&#x27;s protégé, Michael R. Butler, has also been active in advancing the field. Among his contributions is a technical, metalogical study of transcendental arguments in general and the Transcendental argument for the existence of God in particular, which he wrote for Bahnsen&#x27;s festschrift.

By 1952, presuppositional apologetics had acquired a new advocate in the Presbyterian theologian Gordon Clark. He embraced the label &quot;presuppositional&quot; since his approach to apologetics, emphasizing the priority of epistemology and an axiom of revelation, was more closely concerned with the logical order of assumptions than was Van Til. The differences between the two views on presuppositionalism, though few in number, caused a significant rift between the two men, and even after both Clark and Van Til had died, John Robbins (a theologian and former student of Clark&#x27;s) and Bahnsen were often involved in heated exchanges.

In general, Van Til&#x27;s approach is far more popular and widespread than Clark&#x27;s.

==Varieties==

=== Van Tillian presuppositionalism ===

Apologists who follow Van Til earned the label &quot;presuppositional&quot; because of their central tenet that the Christian must at all times presuppose the supernatural revelation of the Bible as the ultimate arbiter of truth and error in order to know anything. Christians, they say, can assume nothing less because all human thought presupposes the existence of the God of the Bible. They claim that by accepting the assumptions of non-Christians, which fundamentally deny the Trinitarian God of the Bible, one could not even formulate an intelligible argument. Though Van Tillians do, at one point, &quot;put themselves in the shoes&quot; of the opponent, &quot;for the sake of argument&quot;, to demonstrate where that position would lead, they claim that they can only do so because this is actually God&#x27;s world, and man is actually God&#x27;s creature, made in God&#x27;s own image, and as such can never completely shut God out (in living or thinking)—hence there is always a common basis for dialogue, even though it is, in the presuppositionalist&#x27;s view, a basis which the opponent is not usually willing to acknowledge and which is decidedly biased rather than neutral.

According to Frame, &quot;[Van Til&#x27;s] major complaints against competing apologetic methods are theological complaints, that is, that they compromise the incomprehensibility of God, total depravity, the clarity of natural revelation, God&#x27;s comprehensive control over creation, and so on.&quot; Within their presuppositionalist framework, Van Tillians do often use foundational concepts for Thomistic and Evidentialist arguments (belief in the uniformity of natural causes, for example), but they are unwilling to grant that such beliefs are justifiable on &quot;natural&quot; (neutral) grounds. Rather, Van Tillians employ these beliefs, which they justify on Biblical grounds, in the service of &quot;transcendental arguments&quot;, which are a sort of meta-argument about foundational principles, necessary preconditions, in which the non-Christian&#x27;s worldview is shown to be incoherent in and of itself and intelligible only because it borrows capital from the Christian worldview. For example, where evidentialists would take the uniformity of natural causes in a closed system as a neutral common starting point and construct a cosmological argument for an unmoved mover, Van Tillian presuppositionalists would ask for a justification for the belief in the uniformity of natural causes in a closed system, given the worldview of the opponent, attempting to show that such a belief presupposes the Christian worldview and is ultimately incompatible with the opposing worldview. Van Til summarized the main drive of his apologetic by saying: &quot;the only proof for the existence of God is that without God you couldn&#x27;t prove anything.&quot;

Van Tillians also stress the importance of reckoning with &quot;the noetic effects of sin&quot; (that is, the effects of sin on the mind), which, they maintain, corrupt man&#x27;s ability to understand God, the world, and himself aright. In their view, as a fallen creature, man does know the truth in each of these areas, but he seeks to find a different interpretation—one in which, as C. S. Lewis said, he is &quot;on the bench&quot; and God is &quot;in the dock.&quot; The primary job of the apologist is, therefore, simply to confront the unbeliever with the fact that, while he is verbally denying the truth, he is nonetheless practically behaving in accord with it. Van Til illustrated this alleged inconsistency as a child, elevated on the father&#x27;s knee, reaching up to slap his face, and Bahnsen used the analogy of a man breathing out air to make the argument that air doesn&#x27;t exist.

Another important aspect of the Van Tillian apologetical program is the distinction between &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;persuasion&quot;. According to the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, man has ample proof in all of creation of God&#x27;s existence and attributes but chooses to suppress it. Van Til likewise claimed that there are valid arguments to prove that the God of the Bible exists but that the unbeliever would not necessarily be persuaded by them because of his suppression of the truth, and therefore the apologist, he said, must present the truth regardless of whether anyone is actually persuaded by it (Frame notes that the apologist is here akin to the psychiatrist who presents the truth about the paranoid&#x27;s delusions, trusting that his patient knows the truth at some level and can accept it—though Frame, as a Calvinist, would say the special intervention of God in the Holy Spirit is also required for the unbeliever to accept ultimate truths.) An implication of this position is that all arguments are &quot;person relative&quot; in the sense that one non-Christian might be persuaded by a particular argument and another might not be, depending on their background and experiences; even if the argument constitutes logically valid proof.

=== Clarkian presuppositionalism ===
Gordon Clark and his followers treat the truth of the Scriptures as the axiom of their system. Like all axioms, this axiom is considered to be self-evident truth, not to be proven, but used for proof. Theologians and philosophers strongly influenced by Dr. Clark include Francis Schaeffer, Carl F. H. Henry, Ronald Nash, Fuller Theological Seminary President Edward J. Carnell and John Robbins of the Trinity Foundation. Clark&#x27;s system has been described by Gary Crampton as, &quot;The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are self-attesting and self-authenticating. Scripture stands in judgment over all books and ideas, and it is to be judged by no person or thing. The Bible alone is the Word of God. This is the Protestant principle of sola scriptura.&quot; However, the worldview that results from the axiom may be tested for consistency and comprehensiveness. Testing for internal contradiction exemplifies Clark&#x27;s strict reliance on the laws of logic (he famously translates the first verse of the Gospel of John as &quot;In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God, and the Logic was God.&quot;) Thus, in order to invalidate non-Christian worldviews, one must simply show how a different presupposition results in necessary logical contradictions, while showing that presupposing the Bible leads to no logical contradiction. By contrast, some Van Tillians have suggested that God as He has revealed Himself in Scripture reveals apparent paradoxes.

However, Clark allowed that presupposing axioms (or &quot;first principles&quot;) themselves do not make a philosophical system true, including his own; the fact that all worldviews he examined other than Christianity had internal contradictions only made Christianity highly more probable as truth, but not necessarily so. Nonetheless, he believed that this method was effective in many practical cases (when arguing against, for instance, secular humanism or dialectical materialism) and that, in the end, each of us must simply choose (that is, make an informed selection) from among seemingly consistent worldviews the one that most adequately answers life&#x27;s questions and seems the most internally coherent. Some Van Tillian critics suggest that the concept of coherence itself must be defined in terms of Christian presuppositions but is instead being used by Clark as a &quot;neutral&quot; principle for discerning the truth of any proposition.

Using this approach, Clark labored to expose the contradictions of many worldviews that were in vogue in his day and to defend the Christian worldview by proving its consistency over and against those who attacked it. His unflagging use of logic sometimes led him to what most Reformed theologians consider rather unorthodox ideas on such topics as the problem of evil—topics which are most often treated by theologians as paradoxes or apparent contradictions not resolvable by human logic. But Clark famously rejected the idea that Scripture teaches paradoxes and notion of &quot;apparent contradiction&quot;, asking &quot;apparent to whom?&quot;. He described an alleged biblical paradox as nothing more than &quot;a charley-horse between the ears that can be eliminated by rational massage.&quot;

With regard to other schools of apologetics, Clark suggested that the cosmological argument was not just unpersuasive but also logically invalid (because it begged the question), and he similarly dismissed the other Thomistic arguments. As a staunch critic of all varieties of empiricism, he did not tend to make much use of evidential arguments, which yield likelihoods and probabilities rather than logical certainties (that is, either coherence or incoherence).

<doc id="704004" wikidata="Q5050165" url="?curid=704004" title="Castle Junction">
<text>Castle Junction is a locality where the northern extent of the Banff–Windermere Highway (Highway 93) intersects with the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1), the Bow River, and Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A) in Banff National Park, Alberta. It is named after the nearby Castle Mountain, clearly visible from the junction. The area is also referred to as Castle Mountain; however, the official location is approximately southwest of Castle Junction along the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Work started here in 1910 on the Auto Route of the Great Divide, a project to build a highway across the Rocky Mountains, when construction began on a road from Castle Junction to Banff. Following an interruption caused by World War I, construction wrapped up in 1923 when the newly constructed road between Calgary and Banff was joined to the Windermere Highway via the road between Castle Junction and Banff.

Prime Minister Mackenzie King changed the name of Castle Mountain to Mount Eisenhower in 1946 to honour the World War II general Dwight D. Eisenhower. Correspondingly, Castle Junction was called Eisenhower Junction. Castle Mountain was officially restored to its original name in 1979, at which time Eisenhower Junction was also renamed Castle Junction.

A group of lodges and the Castle Mountain campground are within a kilometre of the junction. Several hiking trails are available in the vicinity. The trailhead for hikes to Silverton Falls and Rockbound Lake is approximately 200 metres east of Castle Junction. The remains of Silver City, a 19th-century settlement founded by prospectors at the base of Castle Mountain, are nearby. Also nearby is the site of the Castle Mountain Internment Camp used during World War I.

<doc id="704006" wikidata="Q668366" url="?curid=704006" title="Mycenaean Greek">
<text>Mycenaean Greek is the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, on the Greek mainland and Crete in Mycenaean Greece (16th to 12th centuries BC). The language is preserved in inscriptions in Linear B, a script first attested on Crete before the 14th century BC. Most inscriptions are on clay tablets found in Knossos, in central Crete, as well as in Pylos, in the southwest of the Peloponnese. Other tablets have been found at Mycenae itself, Tiryns and Thebes and at Chania, in Western Crete. The language is named after Mycenae, one of the major centres of Mycenaean Greece.

The tablets long remained undeciphered, and many languages were suggested for them, until Michael Ventris, building on the extensive work of Alice Kober, deciphered the script in 1952.

The texts on the tablets are mostly lists and inventories. No prose narrative survives, much less myth or poetry. Still, much may be gleaned from these records about the people who produced them and about Mycenaean Greece, the period before the so-called Greek Dark Ages.

== Phonology ==

Mycenaean preserves some archaic Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Greek features not present in later ancient Greek:

* labialized velar consonants , written as in transcriptions of the Mycenaean spelling system. In other ancient Greek varieties, labialized velars were replaced with labials , dentals , or velars , depending on the context and the dialect. For example, Mycenaean (), pronounced , corresponds to classical Greek , &quot;cowherds&quot;.

* The semivowels . Both were lost in standard Attic Greek, although was preserved in some Greek dialects and written as digamma or beta .

* The glottal fricative between vowels.

The voiceless and voiced affricates and (marked with asterisks in the table above), are hypothesized to have been used in the pronunciation of words written with in transcriptions of the Mycenaean spelling system. Voiced developed from Pre-Greek clusters of a voiced dental or velar stop + *y (&quot;*dy, *gy, *ɡʷy&quot;), or in certain instances from word-initial &quot;*y&quot;, and corresponds to ζ in the Greek alphabet. For example, the Mycenaean words (), pronounced , correspond to classical Greek . Voiceless developed from Pre-Greek clusters of a voiceless or voiceless aspirated velar stop + *y (*ky, *kʰy, *kʷy, kʷʰy) and corresponds to &quot;-ττ-&quot; or &quot;-σσ-&quot; in Greek varieties written in the Greek alphabet. The exact pronunciation of these consonants in Mycenaean is uncertain.

There were at least five vowels , which could be both short and long.

As noted below, the syllabic Linear B script used to record Mycenaean is extremely defective and distinguishes only the semivowels , the sonorants , the stops , the affricate , the sibilant fricative , and (marginally) the glottal fricative . Voiced, voiceless and aspirate occlusives are all written with the same symbols except that stands for and for both and ). Both and are written ; is unwritten unless followed by .

The length of vowels and consonants is not notated. In most circumstances, the script is unable to notate a consonant not followed by a vowel. Either an extra vowel is inserted (often echoing the quality of the following vowel), or the consonant is omitted. (See above for more details.)

Thus, determining the actual pronunciation of written words is often difficult, and using a combination of the PIE etymology of a word, its form in later Greek and variations in spelling is necessary. Even so, for some words the pronunciation is not known exactly, especially when the meaning is unclear from context, or the word has no descendants in the later dialects.

==Orthography==

The Mycenaean language is preserved in Linear B writing, which consists of about 200 syllabic characters and ideograms. Since Linear B was derived from Linear A, the script of an undeciphered Minoan language, the sounds of Mycenaean are not fully represented. A limited number of syllabic characters must represent a much greater number of syllables used in spoken speech: in particular, the Linear B script only fully represents open syllables (those ending in vowel sounds), where Mycenaean Greek frequently used closed syllables (those ending in consonants).

Orthographic simplifications therefore had to be made:
* Contrasts of voice and aspiration were not marked for any consonants except the dentals &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;. For example, , may be either (&quot;I&quot;) or (&quot;I have&quot;).
* &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; are not distinguished: , is (classical &quot;king&quot;).
* The rough breathing is generally not indicated: , is (&quot;reins&quot;). However, , &quot;a2&quot; is optionally used to indicate &quot;ha&quot; at word beginning.
* The consonants &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; are omitted at the end of a syllable or before another consonant (including word-initial &quot;s&quot; before a consonant): , is (&quot;all&quot;); , is (&quot;copper&quot;), , is (&quot;station, outpost&quot;).
* Double consonants are not represented: , is (classical Knossos).
* Other consonant clusters are dissolved orthographically, creating apparent vowels: , is &quot;&quot; ( &quot;&quot; or &quot;ptólin&quot;, &quot;city&quot; ).
* Length of vowels is not marked.
Certain characters can be used alternately: for example, , &quot;a&quot;, can always be written wherever , &quot;a2,&quot; can. However, these are not true homophones (characters with the same sound) because the correspondence does not necessarily work both ways: , &quot;a2&quot; cannot necessarily be used in place of , &quot;a.&quot; For that reason, they are referred to as &#x27;overlapping values&#x27;: signs such as , &quot;a2&quot; are interpreted as special cases or &#x27;restricted applications&#x27; of signs such as , &quot;a&quot;, and their use as largely a matter of an individual scribe&#x27;s preference.

== Morphology ==
Nouns likely decline for 7 cases: nominative, genitive, accusative, dative, vocative, instrumental and locative; 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; and 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural. The last two cases had merged with other cases by Classical Greek. In Modern Greek, only nominative, accusative, genitive and vocative remain as separate cases with their own morphological markings. Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, and number.

Verbs probably conjugate for 3 tenses: past, present, future; 3 aspects: perfect, perfective, imperfective; 3 numbers: singular, dual, plural; 4 moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, optative; 3 voices: active, middle, passive; 3 persons: first, second, third; infinitives, and verbal adjectives.

The verbal augment is almost entirely absent from Mycenaean Greek with only one known exception, , &quot;a-pe-do-ke&quot; (PY Fr 1184), but even that appears elsewhere without the augment, as , &quot;a-pu-do-ke&quot; (KN Od 681). The augment is sometimes omitted in Homer.

==Greek features==

Mycenaean had already undergone the following sound changes particular to the Greek language and so is considered to be Greek:

===Phonological changes===
* Initial and intervocalic &quot;*s&quot; to .
* Voiced aspirates devoiced.
* Syllabic liquids to or ; syllabic nasals to or .
* &quot;*kj&quot; and &quot;*tj&quot; to before a vowel.
* Initial &quot;*j&quot; to or replaced by z (exact value unknown, possibly ).
* &quot;*gj&quot; and &quot;*dj&quot; to /z/.
*&quot;*-ti&quot; to /-si/ (also found in Attic-Ionic, Arcadocypriot, and Lesbian, but not Doric, Boeotian, or Thessalian).

===Morphological changes===
* The use of &quot;-eus&quot; to produce agent nouns
* The third-person singular ending &quot;-ei&quot;
* The infinitive ending &quot;-ein&quot;, contracted from &quot;-e-en&quot;

===Lexical items===
* Uniquely Greek words: 
** , &quot;qa-si-re-u&quot;, *&quot;gʷasiléus&quot; (later Greek: , &quot;&quot;, &quot;king&quot;)

===Comparison with Ancient (Homeric) Greek===
==Corpus==

The corpus of Mycenaean-era Greek writing consists of some 6,000 tablets and potsherds in Linear B, from LMII to LHIIIB. No Linear B monuments or non-Linear B transliterations have yet been found.

The so-called Kafkania pebble has been claimed as the oldest known Mycenaean inscription, with a purported date to the 17th century BC. However, its authenticity is widely doubted, and most scholarly treatments of Linear B omit it from their corpora.

The earliest generally-accepted date for a Linear B tablet belongs to the tablets from the &#x27;Room of the Chariot Tablets&#x27; at Knossos, which are believed to date to the LM II-LM IIIA period, between the last half of the 15th century BCE and the earliest years of the 14th.

==Variations and possible dialects==
While the Mycenaean dialect is relatively uniform at all the centres where it is found, there are also a few traces of dialectal variants:

* &quot;i&quot; for &quot;e&quot; in the dative of consonant stems
* &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;o&quot; as the reflex of &quot;ṇ&quot; (e.g. &quot;pe-ma&quot; instead of &quot;pe-mo&quot; &lt; &quot;*spermṇ&quot;)
* the &quot;e/i&quot; variation in e.g. &quot;te-mi-ti-ja/ti-mi-ti-ja&quot;

Based on such variations, Ernst Risch (1966) postulated the existence of some dialects within Linear B. The &quot;Normal Mycenaean&quot; would have been the standardized language of the tablets, and the &quot;Special Mycenaean&quot; represented some local vernacular dialect (or dialects) of the particular scribes producing the tablets.

Thus, &quot;a particular scribe, distinguished by his handwriting, reverted to the dialect of his everyday speech&quot; and used the variant forms, such as the examples above.

It follows that after the collapse of Mycenaean Greece, while the standardized Mycenaean language was no longer used, the particular local dialects reflecting local vernacular speech would have continued, eventually producing the various Greek dialects of the historic period.

Such theories are also connected with the idea that the Mycenaean language constituted a type of a special koine representing the official language of the palace records and the ruling aristocracy. When the &#x27;Mycenaean linguistic koine&#x27; fell into disuse after the fall of the palaces because the script was no longer used, the underlying dialects would have continued to develop in their own ways. That view was formulated by Antonin Bartonek. Other linguists like Leonard Robert Palmer and also support this view of the &#x27;Mycenaean linguistic koine&#x27;. (The term &#x27;Mycenaean koine&#x27; is also used by archaeologists to refer to the material culture of the region.) However, since the Linear B script does not indicate several possible dialectical features, such as the presence or absence of word-initial aspiration and the length of vowels, it is unsafe to extrapolate that Linear B texts were read as consistently as they were written.

The evidence for &quot;Special Mycenaean&quot; as a distinct dialect has, however, been challenged. Thompson argues that Risch&#x27;s evidence does not meet the diagnostic criteria to reconstruct two dialects within Mycenaean. In particular, more recent paleographical study, not available to Risch, shows that no individual scribe consistently writes &quot;Special Mycenaean&quot; forms. This inconsistency makes the variation between &quot;Normal Mycenaean&quot; and &quot;Special Mycenaean&quot; unlikely to represent dialectical or sociolectical differences, as these would be expected to concentrate in individual speakers, which is not observed in the Linear B corpus.

===Survival===
The prevailing dialect spoken in southern Greece (including Achaea, the Argolid, Laconia, Crete, and Rhodes) at the end of the Bronze Age, was Proto-Arcadocypriot. The Mycenaean and Arcadocypriot dialects belong to the same group, known as Achaean. Certain common innovations of Arcadian and Cypriot, as attested in the first millennium BC, indicate that they represent vernaculars that had slightly diverged from the Mycenaean administrative language, sometime before a migration to Cyprus; possibly during the 13th or 12th century BC.

Ancient Pamphylian also shows some similarity to Arcadocypriot and to Mycenaean Greek.

<text>Helen Losee Wagner (September 3, 1918 – May 1, 2010) was an American actress.

Born in Lubbock, Texas, she is best known for her role as Nancy Hughes McClosky on the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. After appearing in the soap opera for some 50 years, at the time of her death she was the longest serving actor on an American soap opera. She played the role of Trudy Bauer during the initial TV years of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the early 1950s. She appeared on the early soap &quot;Valiant Lady&quot;, as well as on primetime programs including &quot;The World of Mr. Sweeney&quot;, &quot;Mister Peepers&quot;, &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;, and the &quot;Philco-Goodyear Playhouse&quot;.

==Biography==
Helen Losee Wagner was born on September 3, 1918, in Lubbock, Texas, one of two daughters of Charles and Janette (née Tinker) Wagner. She studied music and drama at Monmouth College in Illinois where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938.

Before signing a 13-week contract for &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1956, Wagner had been a singer and stage actress, sometimes working as a church soloist to pay the rent. She had roles in the stage plays &quot;Sunny River&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; on Broadway.

In 1954, she married Robert Willey, an actor and theater producer. He died in 2009. Wagner died of cancer on May 1, 2010, at the age of 91.

==&quot;As the World Turns&quot;==
Wagner played the soap opera&#x27;s matriarch, Nancy Hughes, from its debut on April 2, 1956, until her death. She was acknowledged in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for having the longest run in a single role on television, a position she held until 2010.

Wagner spoke the show&#x27;s very first line, &quot;Good morning, dear.&quot; 

On November 22, 1963, Wagner inadvertently became part of broadcast history. About ten minutes into that day&#x27;s episode of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, a scene featuring her character was interrupted by Walter Cronkite&#x27;s first news bulletin that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas (this bulletin was audio only, as the studio camera was not ready until 20 minutes later). Wagner later remembered that she and actor Santos Ortega, who played Grandpa Hughes, continued with the scene as it was broadcast live, unaware of the unfolding tragedy until they were told about it during a commercial break.

After the death of costar and onscreen husband Don McLaughlin in 1986, the Nancy Hughes character became a widow. She later met and married Dan McClosky (Dan Frazer) and was subsequently part of a storyline in which Dan was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. After it culminated in Dan&#x27;s death, Wagner faced many years with little to no part in the story. She returned to the screen with a pivotal role in a 2004 storyline revolving around her grandson&#x27;s marriage to naïve teenager Alison Stewart (played by Jessica Dunphy). In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Wagner averaged around three appearances a month on the serial. She was prominently featured in the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary episode in April 2006.

Wagner&#x27;s death came less than two months before &quot;As The World Turns&quot; taped its final episode. CBS announced on December 9, 2009, that it was cancelling the show after 54 years on the air. Many fans had hoped that Wagner would be able to close the series with the line &quot;Good night, dear,&quot; just as she had uttered &quot;Good morning, dear&quot; as the first line of the program back in 1956. The last episode was taped on June 23, 2010, and aired on September 17, 2010. 

She was presented with a &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Emmy in May 2004.

==Alma mater==
In 1988, Wagner&#x27;s alma mater, Monmouth College (Illinois), awarded her an honorary degree of &quot;Doctor of Humane Letters&quot;. The following year, Wagner chaired a national committee that raised more than $1 million to replace the school&#x27;s &quot;little theater&quot; with a state-of-the-art facility. On opening night in Monmouth&#x27;s new Wells Theater, Wagner played the role of Eleanor in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;.

<text>The Institute of Cancer Research (the ICR) is a public research institute and a member institution of the University of London in London, United Kingdom, specialising in oncology. It was founded in 1909 as a research department of the Royal Marsden Hospital and joined the University of London in 2003. It has been responsible for a number of breakthrough discoveries, including that the basic cause of cancer is damage to DNA.

The ICR occupies sites in Chelsea, Central London and Sutton, southwest London. The ICR provides both taught postgraduate degree programmes and research degrees and currently has around 340 students. Together with the Royal Marsden Hospital the ICR forms the largest comprehensive cancer centre in Europe, and was ranked second amongst all British higher education institutions in the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;&#x27;s assessment of the 2021 Research Excellence Framework. In clinical medicine, 97% and in biological sciences, 99% of the ICR&#x27;s academic research was assessed to be world leading or internationally excellent (4* or 3*).

The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £138.7 million of which £64.6 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £134.9 million. The ICR receives its external grant funding from the government body the Higher Education Funding Council for England, from government research council bodies and from charities including the Wellcome Trust, Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now and Bloodwise. It also receives voluntary income from legacies and from public and corporate donations. The ICR also runs a number of fundraising appeals and campaigns which help support a variety of cancer research projects.

==Sites==
The ICR occupies two sites in Chelsea, Central London which include the Chester Beatty Laboratories and the ICR corporate offices. A third site in Sutton, Southwest London, houses more research facilities. The location of the two research sites reflects the two sites of the Royal Marsden Hospital. 

== Research==

The ICR pursues its research focused into three main research themes: genetic epidemiology, molecular pathology, and therapeutic development. These areas of research are essential for the development of personalised cancer medicine.

Towards this aim, the ICR and The Royal Marsden have completed a dedicated £17 million Centre for Molecular Pathology (CMP) which opened on the Sutton site on 20 November 2012. The centre exploits the increasing availability of information about the genetic make-up of different cancer types, in order to design new &quot;personalised&quot; treatments that target cancers&#x27; specific molecular defects. The CMP also aims to develop molecular diagnostic techniques that will accurately predict who will benefit most from a treatment, ensuring a patient receives the optimum drug(s) for the best possible outcome. The CMP will build on the organisations&#x27; existing expertise in breast, prostate and paediatric cancers, while providing opportunities for new developments in other cancers such as gastrointestinal, renal, gynaecological, melanoma, head &amp; neck cancers and sarcomas.

In March 2016, the ICR opened a £20 million Centre for Cancer Imaging that brings together experts in a range of different imaging techniques working together to develop better cancer diagnostic and treatment techniques.

The organisation&#x27;s research direction is set out in the ICR Scientific Strategy 2010–2015, which aims to develop key research areas while enhancing partnership affiliations. Its four objectives are to maintain, develop and exploit the unique relationship with the Marsden; to ensure a balanced portfolio of basic and applied research; to develop treatment regimes to the genetic makeup of patient and tumour (personalised medicine) and to recruit, retain and motivate the best staff.

== Teaching ==
The ICR runs an MSc in Oncology programme, which is a modular course aimed primarily at Specialist Registrars in Clinical and Medical Oncology. The course has exit points at Certificate, Diploma and MSc degree level.

== History ==

=== 1909 to 1970 ===

The ICR was founded in 1909, when a new laboratory building adjoining The Cancer Hospital (later named the Royal Marsden Hospital) was established with Alexander Paine as its first director. In 1910 Robert Knox was appointed to head the Electrical and Radio-therapeutic Department at The Cancer Hospital and established the first professionally designed X-ray Department for treatment and diagnosis in Britain. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute was officially opened by Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught, in 1911. In 1921 Archibald Leitch was appointed director of The Cancer Hospital Research Institute. The institute became a postgraduate School of the University of London in 1927. In 1931 Sir Ernest Kennaway FRS became director of the institute. In 1932 a research team led by Kennaway fractionated coal tar and isolated benzo[a]pyrene, which he identified as one of the chemical constituents that induced cancer in mice. These were the first research findings to show that a pure chemical substance can cause cancer. In 1936 Kennaway proposed the potential of a link between smoking and lung cancer. The Cancer Hospital Research Institute moved to a new site on Fulham Road in Chelsea in 1939 and was renamed the Chester Beatty Research Institute.

In 1946 Sir Alexander Haddow FRS FRSE (1907–1976) became the director of the Chester Beatty Research Institute. He remained in the role until 1969,
In 1947, while conducting research at the institute, David Galton became the first physician in the world to use aminopterin (the forerunner of the methotrexate drug) in the treatment of adult leukaemia, producing remission in some cancer patients.

During the 1940s Haddow established a Clinical Chemotherapy Research Unit – the first such unit in Europe – in partnership with the Royal Marsden Hospital and under Galton&#x27;s leadership. The partnership was unique at the time in being able to take the drug discoveries directly into a partner hospital for clinical trials in cancer patients. The unit led to the institute&#x27;s discovery of three successful chemotherapy drugs in the 1950s: busulphan (Myleran), chlorambucil (Leukeran) and melphalan (Alkeran).

In 1952 the ICR&#x27;s Eric Boyland had proposed that certain chemicals that cause cancer (carcinogens) react with DNA through an alkylation mechanism that damaged the DNA molecule. In follow-up research at the ICR in 1964, Professors Peter Brookes and Philip Lawley proved that chemical carcinogens act by damaging DNA, leading to mutations and the formation of tumours, proving that cancer is a genetic disease based on mutational events.

In 1954 the institute was officially renamed The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). The ICR established a second campus in Sutton, Surrey, in 1956. Whilst working at the ICR in 1961, Jacques Miller discovered the immunological role of the thymus, as the repository of a special class of lymphocytes (T cells) essential for the mounting of an immune response.

=== 1970 to 2000===
Scientists at the ICR were instrumental in the development of one of the world&#x27;s most widely used anti-cancer drugs, carboplatin (Paraplatin). Carboplatin&#x27;s development began in 1970 after scientists in the United States discovered that the platinum-based compound cisplatin was effective against many tumours – but had serious side-effects. A team of ICR and RMH scientists and clinicians including Professors Kenneth Harrap and Tom Connors, Hilary Calvert and Hospital Consultant Eve Wiltshaw recognised its potential but also the need for a less toxic alternative. In collaboration with the chemical and precious metal company Johnson Matthey plc the ICR scientists evaluated some 300 different platinum-containing molecules and developed a series of second-generation compounds, of which carboplatin was selected as the lead. The first clinical trial of carboplatin was carried out in 1981 and it was launched commercially as Parplatin (manufactured by Bristol-Myers) in 1986. As of 2012 carboplatin is in use for a range of cancers including ovarian and lung. For the development of these platinum-based anticancer drugs the ICR, together with The Royal Marsden Hospital and Johnson Matthey plc, received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement in 1991.

During the 1980s ICR scientists including Professors Hilary Calvert, and Ken Harrap and Ann Jackman developed raltitrexed (Tomudex) at the ICR, a drug active for the treatment of colon and other cancers. In 1983 research teams at the Chester Beatty Laboratory of the ICR led by Professors Chris Marshall FRS and Alan Hall FRS discovered N-RAS, one of the first human cancer transforming genes (oncogenes). Alan Hall went on in 1992 to discover that the molecular mechanism for the motility behaviour of animal cells (cell to cell attachment and cell movement) is through control of cytoskeletal assembly by specific GTPase-proteins, known as Rho and Rac. The discovery is of fundamental significance in cancer research since cell motility is a key feature of cancer cell behaviour during metastasis (the spread of tumours around the human body).

In 1994 an ICR team led by Michael Stratton discovered the gene BRCA2, which has been linked to breast cancer, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer. Alan Ashworth&#x27;s team in the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at the ICR established the connection between mutations in the BRCA2 gene and the operation of DNA repair pathways in cancer cells. This later led to the development of a PARP inhibitor drug, olaparib, which targets the DNA repair pathways of cancer cells. A Phase I trial of olaparib found in June 2009 that tumours shrank or stabilised for more than half of patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. It is believed that the drug may also be useful in other patients whose cancer it is linked to an error in their DNA repair pathway.

In 1999 the Chester Beatty Laboratory in Chelsea was redeveloped and extended to incorporate the Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, which was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1999.

=== 2000 to present ===

In 2000 Michael Stratton at the ICR initiated the Cancer Genome Project, which was aimed at capitalizing on the knowledge from the Human Genome sequence to screen all human genes in cancer cells to identify those genes responsible for specific cancers. The project was established at the genome sequencing facilities of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, of which Stratton is now the director. One of the first major achievements of the Cancer Genome Project has been the characterisation of the cancer gene BRAF in collaboration with ICR scientists Professors Chris Marshall and Richard Marais. The research by the ICR team, published in June 2002, revealed that damage to the BRAF gene could cause up to 70 per cent of melanoma skin cancers. This has been instrumental in speeding up the development of new drugs for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Since 2002 the ICR has been working to develop drugs that inhibit BRAF in melanoma and other cancers where the gene is defective.

In the five years from 2004/05, the ICR developed on average two drug development candidates per year. Since 2006, it has licensed three novel series of anti-cancer drugs to major pharmaceutical companies: Hsp90 inhibitors to Novartis, PKB inhibitors to AstraZeneca and PI3Kinase inhibitors to Genentech. The PIl3Kinase inhibitor GDC-0941, licensed to Genentech by Piramed, is thought to have potential in a range of human cancers. In laboratory experiments, ICR scientists found that the drug reduced the growth of glioblastoma (the most common form of brain tumour), it decreased the growth of ovarian tumours and in other studies, it was active against cell lines derived from other human cancers.

In conjunction with The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, the ICR tested a promising new prostate cancer drug called abiraterone, which it discovered and developed. A randomised placebo-controlled Phase III trial reported in October 2010 that abiraterone could extend survival in some men with late stage prostate cancer. The trial, funded by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, included 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose advanced prostate cancer had stopped responding to standard therapies. Abiraterone extended the average overall survival of patients from 10.9 months to 14.8 months compared to a placebo, without many of the unpleasant side-effects associated with conventional chemotherapy. The FDA in April 2011 approved the drug for sale in the US under the trade name Zytiga.

<doc id="704018" wikidata="Q605499" url="?curid=704018" title="Short-circuit evaluation">
<text>Short-circuit evaluation, minimal evaluation, or McCarthy evaluation (after John McCarthy) is the semantics of some Boolean operators in some programming languages in which the second argument is executed or evaluated only if the first argument does not suffice to determine the value of the expression: when the first argument of the codice_1 function evaluates to codice_2, the overall value must be codice_2; and when the first argument of the codice_4 function evaluates to codice_5, the overall value must be codice_5.

In programming languages with lazy evaluation (Lisp, Perl, Haskell), the usual Boolean operators short-circuit. In others (Ada, Java, Delphi), both short-circuit and standard Boolean operators are available. For some Boolean operations, like &quot;exclusive or&quot; (XOR), it is impossible to short-circuit, because both operands are always needed to determine a result.

Short-circuit operators are, in effect, control structures rather than simple arithmetic operators, as they are not strict. In imperative language terms (notably C and C++), where side effects are important, short-circuit operators introduce a sequence point: they completely evaluate the first argument, including any side effects, before (optionally) processing the second argument. ALGOL 68 used &quot;proceduring&quot; to achieve &quot;user-defined&quot; short-circuit operators and procedures.

The use of short-circuit operators has been criticized as problematic:
== Definition ==
In any programming language that implements short-circuit evaluation, the expression codice_7 is equivalent to the conditional expression codice_8, and the expression codice_9 is equivalent to codice_10. In either case, &quot;x&quot; is only evaluated once.

The generalized definition above accommodates loosely typed languages that have more than the two truth-values codice_11 and codice_12, where short-circuit operators may return the last evaluated subexpression. This is called &quot;last value&quot; in the table below. For a strictly-typed language, the expression is simplified to codice_13 and codice_14 respectively for the boolean case.

=== Precedence ===
Although takes precedence over in many languages, this is not a universal property of short-circuit evaluation. An example of the two operators taking the same precedence and being left-associative with each other is POSIX shell&#x27;s command-list syntax.

The following simple left-to-right evaluator enforces a precedence of over by a :

 function short-circuit-eval (&quot;operators&quot;, &quot;values&quot;)
 let &quot;result&quot; := True
 for each (&quot;op&quot;, &quot;val&quot;) in (&quot;operators&quot;, &quot;values&quot;):
 if &quot;op&quot; = &quot;AND&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;result&quot; = False
 continue
 else if &quot;op&quot; = &quot;OR&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;result&quot; = True
 return &quot;result&quot;
 else
 &quot;result&quot; := &quot;val&quot;
 return &quot;result&quot;

=== Formalization ===
Short-circuit logic, with or without side-effects, have been formalized based on Hoare&#x27;s conditional. A result is that non-short-circuiting operators can be defined out of short-circuit logic to have the same sequence of evaluation.

==Support in common programming and scripting languages==

The following table is restricted to common programming languages and the basic boolean operators for logical conjunction codice_1 and logical disjunction codice_4. In some languages, the bitwise operators can be used as eager boolean operators. For other languages, bitwise operators are not included in the list, because they do not take boolean values or have a result type different from the respective short-circuit operators.

Note that there are more short-circuit operators, for example the ternary conditional operator, which is codice_17 (C, C++, Java, PHP), codice_18 (ALGOL, Haskell, Kotlin, Rust), codice_19 (Python). Please take a look at ternary conditional operator#Usage.


==Common use==
===Avoiding undesired side effects of the second argument===
Usual example, using a C-based language:

int denom = 0;
if (denom != 0 &amp;&amp; num / denom)
 ... // ensures that calculating num/denom never results in divide-by-zero error 


Consider the following example:

int a = 0;
if (a != 0 &amp;&amp; myfunc(b))
 do_something();


In this example, short-circuit evaluation guarantees that codice_20 is never called. This is because codice_21 evaluates to &quot;false&quot;. This feature permits two useful programming constructs.

# If the first sub-expression checks whether an expensive computation is needed and the check evaluates to &quot;false&quot;, one can eliminate expensive computation in the second argument. 
# It permits a construct where the first expression guarantees a condition without which the second expression may cause a run-time error.

Both are illustrated in the following C snippet where minimal evaluation prevents both null pointer dereference and excess memory fetches:

bool is_first_char_valid_alpha_unsafe(const char *p)
 return isalpha(p[0]); // SEGFAULT highly possible with p == NULL

bool is_first_char_valid_alpha(const char *p)
 return p != NULL &amp;&amp; isalpha(p[0]); // 1) no unneeded isalpha() execution with p == NULL, 2) no SEGFAULT risk


===Idiomatic conditional construct===
Since minimal evaluation is part of an operator&#x27;s semantic definition and not an optional optimization, a number of coding idioms rely on it as a succinct conditional construct. Examples include:

Perl idioms:

some_condition or die; # Abort execution if some_condition is false
some_condition and die; # Abort execution if some_condition is true
POSIX shell idioms:

modprobe -q some_module &amp;&amp; echo &quot;some_module installed&quot; || echo &quot;some_module not installed&quot;

This idiom presumes that codice_22 cannot fail.

==Possible problems==
=== Untested second condition leads to unperformed side effect ===
Despite these benefits, minimal evaluation may cause problems for programmers who do not realize (or forget) it is happening. For example, in the code

if (expressionA &amp;&amp; myfunc(b)) {
 do_something();

if codice_20 is supposed to perform some required operation regardless of whether codice_24 is executed, such as allocating system resources, and codice_25 evaluates as false, then codice_20 will not execute, which could cause problems. Some programming languages, such as Java, have two operators, one that employs minimal evaluation and one that does not, to avoid this problem.

Problems with unperformed side effect statements can be easily solved with proper programming style, i.e., not using side effects in boolean statements, as using values with side effects in evaluations tends to generally make the code opaque and error-prone.

===Reduced efficiency due to constraining optimizations===
Short-circuiting can lead to errors in branch prediction on modern central processing units (CPUs), and dramatically reduce performance. A notable example is highly optimized ray with axis aligned box intersection code in ray tracing. Some compilers can detect such cases and emit faster code, but programming language semantics may constrain such optimizations.

An example of a compiler unable to optimize for such a case is Java&#x27;s Hotspot virtual machine (VM) as of 2012.

<text>Targhee Pass is a mountain pass in the western United States on the Continental Divide. It is located along the border between southeastern Idaho and southwestern Montana, in the Henrys Lake Mountains at an elevation of above sea level. The pass is named for a Bannock chief.

U.S. Highway 20 (US 20) crosses the pass, approximately west of West Yellowstone, on the western boundary of Yellowstone National Park. The pass provides the most direct access to the park from southern Idaho.

The pass is located in the Caribou–Targhee National Forest. Henrys Lake, the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River is located just west of the pass. Hebgen Lake, a reservoir on the Madison River, a tributary of the Missouri River, is located just north of the pass.

==Nez Perce War==
During the Nez Perce War in 1877, Chief Joseph&#x27;s band of Nez Perce traversed the pass on August 22 while evading U.S. Cavalry forces under the command of General Oliver O. Howard. The Nez Perce had just engaged the army in the Idaho Territory at the Battle of Camas Creek. After entering Montana Territory, the Indians moved east up the Madison River into Yellowstone National Park.

<text>Birkbeck, University of London (formally Birkbeck College, University of London), is a public research university located in London, England, and a member institution of the University of London. Established in 1823 as the London Mechanics&#x27; Institute by its founder Joseph Clinton Robertson and its supporters Sir George Birkbeck, Jeremy Bentham, J. C. Hobhouse and Henry Brougham, Birkbeck is one of the few universities to specialise in evening higher education in the United Kingdom.

Birkbeck&#x27;s main building is in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden in Central London. Birkbeck offers more than 200 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Birkbeck&#x27;s academic activities are organised into five constituent faculties, which are subdivided into nineteen departments. The university is a member of academic organisations such as the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association. The university is also a member of the Screen Studies Group, London. The university&#x27;s Centre for Brain Function and Development was awarded The Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for its brain research in 2005.

Birkbeck&#x27;s alumni and former and current staff include five Nobel laureates, numerous political leaders, members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and a British prime minister.

==History==

===Founding===

In 1823 Sir George Birkbeck, a physician and graduate of the University of Edinburgh who was a pioneer of adult education, founded the London Mechanics&#x27; Institute at a meeting in the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand. More than two thousand people attended. However, the idea was not universally popular and some accused Birkbeck of &quot;scattering the seeds of evil.&quot;

In 1825 the Institute moved to the Southampton Buildings on Chancery Lane. In 1830 the first female students were admitted. In 1858 changes to the University of London&#x27;s structure resulted in opening up access for the Institute&#x27;s students to its examinations and its degrees. The Institute became the main provider of part-time university education.

In 1866 the Institute changed its name to the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution.

In 1885 Birkbeck moved to the Breams Building on Fetter Lane, where it remained for the next 67 years.

In 1904 Birkbeck Students&#x27; Union was established.

===Birkbeck College===
In 1907 Birkbeck&#x27;s name was shortened to Birkbeck College. In 1913 a review of the University of London, which had been restructured in 1900, recommended that Birkbeck become a constituent college of the University, but the outbreak of the First World War delayed this until 1920. The Royal Charter was granted in 1926.

In 1921 the college&#x27;s first female professor, Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, began teaching botany. Other distinguished faculty in the years between the two world wars included Nikolaus Pevsner, J. D. Bernal and Cyril Joad.

During the Second World War Birkbeck was the only central University of London college not to be relocated outside the capital. In 1941 the college&#x27;s library suffered a direct hit during The Blitz, but teaching continued. During the war the college organised lunch-time extramural lectures for the public, given by, among others, Joad, Pevsner and Harold Nicolson.

In 1952 the college moved to its present location in Malet Street.

===Current status===
In 2002 the college was rebranded Birkbeck, University of London, although Birkbeck College, University of London remains its full legal name. In 2003, following a major redevelopment, its building in Malet Street was reopened by the Chancellor of the University of London, The Princess Royal.

In 2006 Birkbeck announced that it had been granted five million pounds by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to expand its provision into East London, working with the University of East London. The partnership, which was launched on 21 November 2006, is called Birkbeck Stratford.

Birkbeck is the largest college of the University of London not to award its own degrees. Although it has held its own degree-awarding powers since 2012, Birkbeck has chosen to hold these in reserve, preferring to award University of London degrees. It also offers many continuing education courses leading to certificates and diplomas, foundation degrees, and short courses.

In late October 2022 the University and College Union published a press release in which it stated that Birkbeck was planning to significantly reduce its staff because of a multi-million-pound deficit, in a restructuring that could lead to compulsory redundancies. In the same release it was stated that the local UCU branch had passed a motion of no confidence in the senior leadership team. Protests against possible job cuts took place at Birkbeck in November 2022.

In 2022 &quot;Birkbeck&quot;, a history of the college, was published by Oxford University Press to mark the 200th anniversary of its foundation.
===The School of Continuing Education===
In 1876 the London Society for the Extension of University Education was founded with the aim of encouraging working people to undertake higher education. In 1903 it became the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the University of London, and in 1988 was integrated into Birkbeck, first as the Centre for Extramural Studies and then as the School of Continuing Education. In 2009 the Faculty of Lifelong Learning was incorporated into the main college structure.

==Campus and location==
Birkbeck is principally located between Malet Street and Woburn Square in Bloomsbury. The School of Arts, including the Department of English &amp; Humanities, is housed in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s former residence in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury. (Other notable former residents of the house include John Maynard Keynes, Vanessa Bell and Lydia Lopokova.) The building includes the Birkbeck Cinema. and the Peltz Gallery.

Many Birkbeck classes are taught at other locations around Bloomsbury, not only because Birkbeck is committed to widening participation in higher education, but also because nearly all classes on any one day are taught at the same time, resulting in heavy competition for limited space.

Birkbeck has expanded into East London, in conjunction with the University of East London. The project is known as Birkbeck Stratford. The campus opened in November 2013.

A building on Euston Road was refurbished by Penoyre &amp; Prasad to be used by Birkbeck in 2021.

In 2021 it was announced that Birkbeck would be leasing Student Central. After refurbishment, the building reopened during the 2022-23 academic year.

==Organisation==

===Faculties and schools===

The college was previously organised into five schools comprising 19 departments, but it now consists of three faculties that comprise a total of nine schools:

* Faculty of Business and Law
** Birkbeck Business School
** Birkbeck Law School
* Faculty of Humanities and Social Science 
** School of Creative Arts, Culture and Communication 
** School of Historical Studies
** School of Social Sciences
** Birkbeck Centre for Counselling
* Faculty of Science
** School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences
** School of Natural Sciences
** School of Psychological Sciences

==Academic profile==

===Research and teaching===
The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities (BIR) was established in 2004, with the renowned but controversial Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek appointed as International Director. According to its website, the Institute aims to &quot;engage with important public issues of our time through a series of open debates, lectures, seminars and conferences&quot; and to &quot;foster and promote a climate of interdisciplinary research and collaboration among academics and researchers&quot;. The launch of the Institute was not without controversy, provoking an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; titled &quot;What have intellectuals ever done for the world?&quot; which criticised the ostensible irrelevance and elitism of contemporary public intellectuals. The current director of the institute is Costas Douzinas.

2004 also saw Birkbeck enter into a research and teaching collaboration with the Institute of Education, jointly founding the London Knowledge Lab. This interdisciplinary research institute brings together social scientists and computer scientists to address research questions about technology and learning.

Meanwhile, the London Consortium, a graduate school that represents a collaboration between Birkbeck, the Tate Galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the Architectural Association, and, until 1999, the British Film Institute, has been running since the mid-1990s, offering master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in interdisciplinary humanities and cultural studies. Its permanent and adjunct faculty has included Tom McCarthy, Colin MacCabe, Laura Mulvey, Steven Connor, Marina Warner, Juliet Mitchell, Stuart Hall, the late Roger Scruton, Salman Rushdie, Tilda Swinton as well as Slavoj Žižek. Its current chair is Anthony Julius.
David Latchman, who became Master of the Birkbeck in 2003, forged closer relations between Birkbeck and University College London (UCL). Joint research centres include the UCL/Birkbeck Institute for Earth and Planetary Sciences, UCL/Birkbeck/IoE Centre for Educational Neuroscience, the UCL/Birkbeck Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, and the Birkbeck-UCL Centre for Neuroimaging.

Science research at Birkbeck has a notable tradition. David Bohm, who made notable contributions to the theory of quantum mechanics, was Professor of Theoretical Physics from 1961 to 1987, and other distinguished Birkbeck scientists include Aaron Klug in the Department of crystallography, Derek Barton in the Department of Chemistry, and Roger Penrose and David Bohm in the Department of Physics. Kathleen Booth wrote the first computer assembly language. Birkbeck is part of the Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, which includes the Bloomsbury Centre for Structural biology, established in 1998. This is a collaborative venture between Birkbeck and UCL, and is a leading academic centre for translating gene sequences and determining protein structure and function. It also includes the Bloomsbury Centre for Bioinformatics, a collaborative venture also between Birkbeck College and University College London for research into Bioinformatics, Genomics, Systems Biology, Grid computing and Text mining.

Birkbeck was ranked 13th in &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; 2001 Research Assessment Exercise and 26th in the &quot;Times Higher Education&#x27;s&quot; equivalent table. In the 2008 RAE results, Birkbeck ranked in the top 25% of UK multi-faculty Higher Education Institutions. The RAE rated the quality of research in a range of subjects at 159 Higher Education Institutions in the UK. Birkbeck submissions from Earth Sciences, Psychology, History, Classics and Archaeology and History of Art, Film and Visual Media were rated in the top five nationally. In REF2014, half of Birkbeck&#x27;s submissions were rated in the top 20 nationally, and eight submissions received 100% ranking for Research Environment. 73% of Birkbeck&#x27;s research was rated &quot;world-leading&quot; (4*) or &quot;internationally excellent&quot; (3*). In the 2021 REF exercise, Birkbeck performed very well throughout, with notable success in English Language &amp; Literature, where Birkbeck was second nationally, and Art and Design, where Birkbeck was fourth nationally.

=== Rankings ===

Birkbeck&#x27;s Centre for Brain Function and Development was awarded The Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for its brain research in 2005. In 2010, Birkbeck was shortlisted for the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; University of the Year Award.

In 2021 the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; ranked Birkbeck 95th in the world for Psychology. The university is consistently ranked in the top 100 in the world by &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; for English Language &amp; Literature and Philosophy. Internationally, Birkbeck was ranked within the top 400 universities in the world by the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020&quot; and &quot;QS World University Rankings 2020.&quot;

In 2018 Birkbeck announced that it would withdraw from UK university rankings because their methodologies unfairly penalise it, since &quot;despite having highly rated teaching and research, other factors caused by its unique teaching model and unrelated to its performance push it significantly down the ratings&quot;.

==Students&#x27; Union==

The Birkbeck Students&#x27; Union (BBKSU) was founded in 1904 and was one of the founding members of the National Union of Students.

Initially governed by a Council, elected from and responsible to the students, today it is governed jointly by a Student Council, Executive Committee and Board of Trustees.

Students initially paid an annual membership fee to join, but students are now automatically registered as members when they enrol onto a course at the college.

Birkbeck Students&#x27; Union offers a number of student groups for students, as well as a various sports clubs that compete in the LUSL. It also provides student representation, support and advice services, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities.

== Founding and history ==
Following the 1991 Gulf War, Elias Bou Saab and his team from the American Intercontinental University explored establishing an American-style university in the Persian Gulf due to a lack of quality private education.

Dubai was identified as an ideal location due to political stability and growing education sector. Bou Saab then established the American University in Dubai in 1995 with the support of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. 

AUD rapidly grew after starting with 165 students. In 2000, it moved to a new campus of 1,400,000 square feet with 687 students. The university was then officially licensed by the UAE Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in 2000, highlighting big growth in the region&#x27;s private higher education sector. 

On the same year, AUD&#x27;s largest academic department &amp; school, Business Administration, was established. In 2001, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the American University in Dubai (AUD) and the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta, GA to establish a School of Engineering. 

Representatives from Georgia Tech, including six senior faculty and administrative officers, visited AUD to finalize the adaptation of curricula to the requirements of the UAE.

<doc id="704035" wikidata="Q529596" url="?curid=704035" title="Charita Bauer">
<text>Charita Bauer (December 20, 1923 – February 28, 1985) was an American soap opera radio and television actress.

Born in Newark, New Jersey, on December 20, 1923, she began her career at the age of eight as a model for clothing ads. Her talents included singing, playing the piano, and speaking three languages.

==Stage==
Bauer attended the Professional Children&#x27;s School in New York, and her first theater appearance was on Broadway in &quot;Thunder on the Left&quot; (1933). She was the only child actress in &quot;The Women&quot; on Broadway in 1936. By 1942, Bauer&#x27;s maturity was evident as a newspaper reported, &quot;Charita Bauer ... gets her first &#x27;grown-up&#x27; role in a Broadway play in William Roos&#x27; &quot;Life of Reilly&quot;, which opens on Apr. 29.&quot; In 1944, she played in &quot;Good Morning, Corporal&quot;, on Broadway, with a reviewer commenting, &quot;she&#x27;s grown up and in this play has the role of a young woman ...&quot;

==Radio==
Bauer first appeared on radio on WPAP in New York City as a child. She was active throughout the 1930s and 1940s on numerous radio dramas of the day, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend&quot;, &quot;Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons&quot;. &quot;The March of Time&quot;, &quot;The FBI in Peace and War&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot; and other programs.

She played Sarah O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Rose of My Dreams&quot;, Mary Aldrich in &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot; (a role she also played on the television version of the program) and Judy Todhunter in &quot;David Harum&quot;. Bauer also played in &quot;Second Husband&quot;, &quot;The Parker Family&quot;, and &quot;Orphans of Divorce&quot;.

On November 11, 1944, Bauer made her 2,000th radio broadcast when she appeared on &quot;Grand Central Station&quot;.

==&quot;Guiding Light&quot;==
She played headstrong and opinionated Bertha &quot;Bert&quot; Miller Bauer on the long-running soap &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; on radio from 1950 to 1956 and on TV from 1952 to 1985. In 1962, Bauer was featured in one of the earliest social issue storylines on American daytime television, as her character Bert was diagnosed with uterine cancer. The storyline helped millions of women realize the importance of regular checkups and pap smear screenings. Bauer received a record amount of mail from fans.

To avoid confusion between her real life and her popular soap role, Charita asked the show&#x27;s producers to name her TV son Michael after her own son Michael Crawford. (The show was aired live in the early days, and a mistake like addressing her TV son by an incorrect name would have been difficult to cover.)

While her character was a spitfire in the earlier days, by the 1970s she had been relegated to the ceremonial role of town matriarch, a role she would fill for the show for the remainder of her run. Just before Thanksgiving 1983, complications from a blood clot forced Bauer to have her leg amputated. When she returned to the show in April 1984, her character&#x27;s life mirrored her own.

In the storyline, after visiting Aunt Meta in New York, Bert returned to Springfield and began experiencing pain in her leg (which had been fitted with a prosthesis by this time and mostly kept off camera). She ended up having &quot;her&quot; leg amputated just as the actress who played her had. For the first time in decades, Bert had to depend upon others to wait on her hand and foot, resulting in one of the series&#x27; most memorable stories. (Bert, sitting in a wheelchair at Cedars Hospital, told Josh Lewis, who had been paralyzed recently and had given up hope, that life itself was a miracle and never to forget it.) In a moving scene, Bert dropped a teacup. She tried to get it, but could not, and in sheer frustration, she burst into tears. As she went through rehab following her operation, camera shot closed in on her remaining leg as she learned to walk again, bringing even more realism to the storyline.

In 1983, Bauer&#x27;s long-time contributions to television were honored when she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

Bauer received a posthumous Lifetime Contribution Daytime Emmy Award that summer, along with &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;&#x27;s Larry Haines and Mary Stuart (who in the 1990s would play Meta Bauer). Her character Bert died, and was mourned on-camera in March 1986, a full year after Charita Bauer died.

==Death==
Bauer died February 28, 1985, at age 62 after a long illness. She was survived by her father, her son, and her grandson.

<text>Xenia Stad-de Jong (4 March 1922 – 3 April 2012) was a Dutch track and field athlete who competed in sprinting events.

Born in Semarang in the former Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), her greatest success was winning the gold medal as the first runner in the 4 x 100 metres relay at the 1948 Summer Olympics, together with Netty Witziers-Timmer, Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs and Fanny Blankers-Koen. She took part in the individual 100 metres event, where she was eliminated in the semi-finals.

In 1950, she won another medal with the Dutch relay team when they finished second at the 1950 European Championships. She ran in the individual 100 m at the championships as well.

Stad-de Jong died in the Dutch city of Zoetermeer in 2012, aged 90.

<text>HMS &quot;Duncan&quot;, launched in 1957, was the fifth RN ship named after Admiral Adam Duncan. She was a of the Royal Navy that served in the Cod Wars.

==Service==
From her first commissioning in 1958 until 1965 &quot;Duncan&quot; was the leader of the Fishery Protection Squadron. She was involved in the First Cod War between United Kingdom and Iceland over fishing rights, intervening between the Icelandic coastguard and British trawlers.

She was an escort to the royal yacht in August 1960. Between 1960 and 1962 her captain was George Cunningham Leslie. From 1962 until 1964 her captain was Richard Trowbridge, who was later promoted to Rear Admiral and served as Flag Officer, Royal Yachts from 1970 until 1975, and in retirement as Governor of Western Australia from 1980 to 1983.

In 1964 &quot;Duncan&quot; fired the salute at the opening of the new Forth Road Bridge. She was given the Freedom of the city of Hull for the part the vessel played in the Cod Wars. In 1966 she completed a long refit and modernisation of all her sonar and anti-submarine equipment at Rosyth Naval Dockyard, and then became employed mainly in anti-submarine training duties, first in the Londonderry Squadron and then from 1969 in the Portland Training Squadron. In 1967 she attended Portsmouth Navy Days.

Sir Robin Knox-Johnson, who in 1968 was the first person to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the Earth while also winning the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, was a watch-keeping and communications officer on &quot;Duncan&quot; from January to April of that year.

In 1970 &quot;Duncan&quot; was again present at Portsmouth Navy Days, as part of the Portland Training Squadron. On 2 April 1971, &quot;Duncan&quot; paid off from the Portland Training Squadron.

During the early 1980s, &quot;Duncan&quot; served alongside the frigate as harbour training ship at Rosyth Dockyard for the marine engineering artificer apprentices from the shore base HMS &quot;Caledonia&quot;.

<text>Jeannette Josephina Maria &quot;Netti&quot; Witziers-Timmer (née &quot;Timmer&quot;, 22 July 1923 – 25 January 2005) was a Dutch sprinter. In 1944 she was a member of the Dutch teams that set world records in the 4×110 yard and 4×200 m relays. Two years later she won a European title, and in 1948 an Olympic gold medal in the 4×100 m relay with Xenia Stad-de Jong, Gerda van der Kade-Koudijs, and Fanny Blankers-Koen. The 1948 Dutch relay team was remarkable (for that era) in that all its members were married and had children.

==Biography==
Witziers-Timmer died on 25 January 2005. She was 81 at the time of her death.

<text>Fat Wreck Chords (pronounced &quot;Fat Records&quot;) is an independent record label based in San Francisco focused on punk rock. It was started by NOFX lead singer Michael Burkett (better known as Fat Mike) and his wife at the time, Erin Burkett in 1990. As of 2009, Fat Wreck Chords has released over 300 studio albums.
==History==

Fat Mike started his record label Wassail Records in 1987. He put out two NOFX records, The PMRC 7” in 1987 and Liberal Animation in 1988. In 1990, he and his wife Erin Burkett co-founded Fat Wreck Chords, and re-released NOFX&#x27;s 1987 EP, The P.M.R.C Can Suck on This. In 1992, Fat Mike went on to produce Lagwagon, Propagandhi, and No Use for a Name. In 1993, the label released records by Rancid, Face to Face, and Strung Out. Fat Mike &amp; Erin continue to run the label together and remain 100% independent. 

The label grew during the 1990s selling over a million records per year. It had 18 employees and four offices. A documentary about Fat Wreck Chords called &#x27;A Fat Wreck&#x27; was released on October 25, 2016.

==Imprints==
The label has had two subsidiaries over the years, Honest Don&#x27;s and Pink and Black. Honest Don&#x27;s released records from Chixdiggit and Teen Idols amongst others, while Pink &amp; Black released albums from female-fronted bands like Fabulous Disaster and Dance Hall Crashers.

Fat Mike advanced $50,000 to Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky of Propagandhi which he recouped within months from sales of Propagandhi records to help them start up their own label, G7 Welcoming Committee, though G7WC is independent from Fat Wreck.

==Discography==
===Compilation albums===

Fat Wreck Chords regularly releases compilation albums, often to promote bands signed to the label, but also, since 2003, to raise funds for various charities. The earliest Fat Wreck Chords compilations have titles with some reference to fatness.

Shortly after &quot;Fat Music Volume IV&quot; was released, Fat Wreck Chords released a similarly titled album, &quot;Short Music for Short People&quot;, which features 101 songs, all averaging approximately 30 seconds. The shortest song (&quot;Short Attention Span&quot; by the Fizzy Bangers) is only eight seconds, and the longest (&quot;Out of Hand&quot; by Bad Religion) is 40 seconds. Some of the songs were commissioned and recorded specifically for the album, while others were from the bands&#x27; pre-existing repertoires.

Since the last &quot;Fat Music&quot; album has been released, the Fat Wreck Chords compilations have been explicitly for charitable causes. &quot;&quot; is a benefit album for the animal rights organization PETA, and &quot;&quot; is a benefit album for the children&#x27;s rights group PROTECT. Between &quot;Liberation&quot; and &quot;PROTECT&quot;, two other compilation albums were released in protest of President George W. Bush and his administration: &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Vol. 2&quot;. To celebrate 20 years of business Fat Wreck Chords released the 3-disc &quot;Wrecktrospective&quot; compilation on December 8, 2009. Disc 1 is composed of the label&#x27;s greatest hits, disc 2 is composed of unreleased demos and rarities, and disc 3 is composed the Fat Club 7&quot; series in its entirety.

===Album series===
====Live in a Dive====
&quot;Live in a Dive&quot; is a series of live albums recorded by Fat Wreck Chords. In order of release:

===Fat Club Series===

In addition to the Live in a Dive series, Fat Wreck Chords also released the Fat Club series of 7&quot; vinyl records during 2001. The series was only available to mail-order subscribers which received one single every month. Fat Wreck Chords did not publish any information on the upcoming releases so subscribers would not know what they were about to receive until the record arrived in the post.

Although the Fat club series was limited to 1,300 copies for each single, the songs contained on the records were later released as the third disc of the Wrecktrospective collection.

<text>A Simple Wish is a 1997 American children&#x27;s-fantasy-comedy film directed by Michael Ritchie, and starring Martin Short, Mara Wilson, and Kathleen Turner. The film is about Murray (Short), a bumbling male fairy godmother who tries to prove himself capable by helping a young girl named Annabel (Wilson) fulfill her wish that her father, an aspiring actor, wins the leading role in a Broadway musical.

It was the final film to be directed by Michael Ritchie, before his death in 2001 (not counting &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (2000), which was shot in 1995). It was a commercial failure and received mostly negative reviews from critics though the cast and concept received some praise.

==Plot==
Carriage driver Oliver Greening aspires to perform on Broadway and, despite an outstanding audition for a new musical based on &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, he loses out to the seasoned Tony Sable, who is considered more bankable than the unknown Oliver.

Later that night, Anabel, Oliver&#x27;s young daughter, does not convince her brother Charlie that fairy godmothers exist, and after they fall asleep, she awakens to find Murray, a male fairy godmother, in her room. Murray, who is treated with disdain for being a man in a female-dominated profession, agrees to grant Anabel&#x27;s wish that her father get the part so that her family will not have to move to Nebraska, hoping that by doing so he will be taken seriously.

Hortence, the head fairy godmother, oversees the North American Fairy Godmothers Association (NAFGA)&#x27;s annual meeting. All participants must turn in their wands so that no trouble occurs. The evil witch Claudia, who was banished from the NAFGA for her selfish use of magic, sneaks in and turns Hortence into paper with a curse. She then steals all the collected wands; Murray arrives late to the conference and does not check his wand in, making it the only one she does not have.

Seeing Murray accidentally left his wand behind in his rush to make it to the conference, Anabel plans to return it to him. However, Charlie breaks it. Anabel glues the broken pieces together and gives it to Murray, only to wind up in Nebraska after the former botches a spell for instantaneous travel. An angry local threatens them, and Murray tries to turn him into a tiny rabbit but instead transforms him into a giant rabbi. Before the giant stomps on them, Murray casts the travel spell again, and they wind up in the Central Park zoo just as Oliver arrives in his carriage with Charlie.

Anabel begs Murray to grant her wish, but he accidentally turns Oliver into a statue. To fix it, the three go to ask Hortence for help, only to find her still under Claudia&#x27;s curse. While Murray fixes his wand with Charlie&#x27;s help, Hortence reveals that, in keeping with the rules governing fairy godmothers, Anabel must break Murray&#x27;s spell by midnight, or Oliver will be a statue forever. Claudia, meanwhile, realizes that Hortense had secretly given her wand to Murray so as to keep her from regaining her full power.

At the theatre, Anabel asks Murray to try sabotaging Sable&#x27;s audition. First, he tries to make it rain on the stage, but the weak downpour is dismissed as a simple technical problem, and the audition continues. Then she asks him to give Sable a &quot;frog in his throat&quot; to impair his singing. Murray takes this literally, and frogs start hopping out of Sable&#x27;s mouth, shocking everyone.

Nevertheless, Sable is given the part as the director refuses to wait for Oliver and wants to get the show into production. Boots, Claudia&#x27;s dog-turned-human servant, finds them. Murray and Anabel trick Boots into taking them to Claudia by begging her not to. Claudia demands that they hand over her wand, and when they refuse, she resorts to torture by enchanting them to dance for her amusement until they are worn out.

Anabel keeps Claudia distracted while Charlie attempts to give Murray the wand, but Boots manages to grab it. Murray then plays on Boots being unhappy with the way Claudia treats her to convince her that he should have the wand instead of her mistress. Claudia attacks him, but Murray tricks her into casting a spell that traps her within her own magic mirror, which he shatters to keep her imprisoned for eternity.

Murray, Charlie, and Anabel return to Central Park and restore Oliver just in time for him to be given the part of Sable&#x27;s understudy. To grant Anabel&#x27;s wish, Murray appears backstage and causes Sable to slip on a bucket and twist his ankle. The resulting temper tantrum gets him fired and Oliver, his understudy, takes over. Charlie and Anabel watch the show with Murray and the other fairy godmothers.

==Reception==
Reception to the movie was negative, with Pixelated Geek&#x27;s Cinerina stating that while the movie&#x27;s jokes might not appeal to adults, the movie would have appeal for a younger audience. Roger Ebert gave the film one and half stars, saying &quot;When family audiences avoid inspired films like &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;The Little Princess&quot; and &quot;Shiloh&quot;, why would they choose a pallid exercise like this?&quot; ReelViews and the Austin Chronicle both reviewed the film, with the Chronicle stating that &quot;The concept&#x27;s good... But this family film about an incompetent fairy godmother named Murray (Short), is shy several handfuls of fairy dust.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 25% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10.

<text>The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial, at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Hawaii, marks the resting place of 1,102 of the 1,177 sailors and Marines killed on during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and commemorates the events of that day. The attack on Pearl Harbor led to the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II.

The memorial, built in 1962, is visited by more than two million people annually. Accessible only by boat, it straddles the sunken hull of the battleship without touching it. Historical information about the attack, shuttle boats to and from the memorial, and general visitor services are available at the associated USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial Visitor Center, which opened in 1980 and is operated by the National Park Service. The battleship&#x27;s sunken remains were declared a National Historic Landmark on May 5, 1989.

The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial is one of several sites in Hawaii that are part of the Pearl Harbor National Memorial.

==Memorial==
===Conception and funding===
During and following the end of World War II, &quot;Arizona&quot;″s wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull.

Robert Ripley, of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; fame, visited Pearl Harbor in 1942. Six years later, in 1948, he did a radio broadcast from Pearl Harbor. Following that broadcast, with the help of his longtime friend Doug Storer, he got in contact with the Department of the Navy. He wrote letters to Rear Admiral J.J. Manning of the Bureau of Yards and Docks regarding his desire for a permanent memorial.

While Ripley&#x27;s original idea for a memorial was disregarded due to the cost, the Navy continued with the idea of creating a memorial. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet, attached a flag pole to the main mast of the &quot;Arizona&quot; in 1950, and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the deckhouse. Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952, but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War.

The Navy placed the first permanent memorial, a -tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship deckhouse on December 7, 1955. President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved the creation of a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial, budgeted at $500,000, be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized.

Principal contributions to the memorial included:

* $50,000 Territory of Hawaii initial contribution in 1958
* $95,000 privately raised following a 1958 &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; television segment featuring Rear Admiral (ret.) Samuel G. Fuqua, Medal of Honor recipient and the senior surviving officer from the &quot;Arizona&quot;
* $64,000 from a March 25, 1961 benefit concert by Elvis Presley, which was his final live performance until 1968
* $40,000 from the sale of plastic models of the &quot;Arizona&quot;, in a partnership between the Fleet Reserve Association and Revell Model Company
* $150,000 from federal funds in legislation initiated by Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye in 1961

During planning stages, the memorial&#x27;s purpose was the subject of competing visions. Some were eager to keep it a tribute to the sailors of the &quot;Arizona&quot;, while others expected a dedication to all who died in the Pacific theater. In the end, the legislation authorizing and funding the memorial (HR 44, 1961) declared that the &quot;Arizona&quot; would &quot;be maintained in honor and commemoration of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who gave their lives to their country during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941.&quot;

===Design===

The national memorial was designed by Honolulu architect Alfred Preis, who was detained at Sand Island at the start of the war as an enemy of the country, because of his Austrian birth. The United States Navy specified the memorial be in the form of a bridge floating above the ship and accommodating 200 people.

The structure has two peaks at each end connected by a sag in the center of the structure. Critics initially called the design a &quot;squashed milk carton&quot;.

The architecture of the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial is explained by Preis as, &quot;Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory ... The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted, to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses ... his innermost feelings.&quot;

===Description===

The national memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, to commemorate the date of the attack. There are rumors that the 21 windows symbolically represent a 21-gun salute or 21 Marines standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site have confirmed that this was not the architect&#x27;s intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, leis were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.

One of &quot;Arizona&quot;″s three anchors is displayed at the visitor center&#x27;s entrance. (One of the other two is at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix.) One of the two ship&#x27;s bells is in the visitor center. (Its twin is in the clock tower of the Student Memorial Center at the University of Arizona in Tucson.)

The shrine at the far end is a marble wall that bears the names of all those killed on &quot;Arizona&quot;, protected behind velvet ropes. To the left of the main wall is a small plaque which bears the names of thirty or so crew members who survived the 1941 sinking. Any surviving crew members of &quot;Arizona&quot; (or their families on their behalf) can have their ashes interred within the wreck by U.S. Navy divers.

===History===

The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial was formally dedicated on May 30, 1962 (Memorial Day) by Texas Congressman and Chairman of Veteran Affairs Olin E. Teague and future-Governor John A. Burns.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. While the wreck of the &quot;Arizona&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989, the memorial does not share this status. Rather, it is listed separately from the wreck on the National Register of Historic Places. The joint administration of the memorial by the United States Navy and the National Park Service was established on September 9, 1980.

Oil leaking from the sunken battleship can still be seen rising from the wreckage to the water&#x27;s surface. This oil is sometimes referred to as &quot;the tears of the &quot;Arizona&quot;&quot; or &quot;black tears.&quot; In a &quot;National Geographic&quot; feature published in 2001, concerns were expressed that the continued deterioration of the &quot;Arizona&quot;″s bulkheads and oil tanks from saltwater corrosion could pose a significant environmental threat from a rupture, resulting in a significant release of oil. The National Park Service states it has an ongoing program that closely monitors the submerged vessel&#x27;s condition.

The Park Service, as part of its Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, developed a &quot;mobile park&quot; to tour the continental United States to increase exposure of the park. The mobile park also collected oral histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

===Maintenance===
The marble wall is vulnerable to the presence of salt water vapor which causes stains and erosion damage to gradually appear. The original wall was replaced in 1984 and the first replacement wall was replaced in 2014.

==USS &quot;Missouri&quot;==

Upon the deck of the battleship in Tokyo Bay, the Japanese surrendered to United States General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, ending World War II. In 1999, &quot;Missouri&quot; was moved to Pearl Harbor from the United States west coast and docked behind, and in line, with USS &quot;Arizona&quot;, placing it perpendicular to the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. The pairing of the two ships became an evocative symbol of the beginning and end of the United States&#x27; participation in the war.

USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial staff initially criticized the placement of &quot;Missouri&quot;, saying the large battleship would &quot;overshadow&quot; the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. To guard against this perception, &quot;Missouri&quot; was placed well back of the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial, and positioned in Pearl Harbor to prevent those participating in military ceremonies on &quot;Missouri&quot;″s aft decks from seeing the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. The decision to have &quot;Missouri&quot;″s bow face the Memorial was intended to convey that &quot;Missouri&quot; now watches over the remains of &quot;Arizona&quot; so that those interred within &quot;Arizona&quot;″s hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the identities of the &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial and the USS &quot;Missouri&quot;, thereby improving the public&#x27;s perception of having &quot;Arizona&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; in the same harbor.

==Visits==
===By the public===
The visitor center operated by the National Park Service is free to the public and has a museum with exhibits about the Pearl Harbor attack, such as the ship&#x27;s bell from &quot;Arizona&quot;.

More than one million people visit the memorial each year. Access to the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial is by U.S. Navy boat, for which an online reservation is required (in-person reservations were discontinued in February 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Because of the large number of visitors and the limited number of boat departures, most of the reservations available each day are often fully allocated weeks in advance, although a limited number are held back for release the day before. Before boarding the boat for the short trip to the Memorial, visitors view a 23-minute documentary film depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor. Touring of the Memorial is self-guided. The National Park Service Web site provides visitor information, including hours of operation and ticketing advisories.

A one-hour audio tour of the Memorial and Center exhibits, narrated by actress Jamie Lee Curtis, whose father, Tony Curtis was a World War II and Navy veteran, is available for rent at the visitor center. On the center&#x27;s grounds along the shoreline are more exhibits and a &quot;Remembrance Circle&quot;. Nearby is , a World War II diesel submarine, which may be toured with separate, paid admission. The battleship USS &quot;Missouri&quot; and the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor may also be visited, but require a bus ride to Ford Island.

On May 6, 2018, boat transportation to the memorial was suspended after one of the vessel operators noticed a crack on its outside. Although repairs were made, the cracks reappeared. The memorial was closed on May 26, 2018, and remained closed until September 1, 2019, but boat tours around the memorial and the other ships on Battleship Row continued to be made. The memorial briefly closed again in September and December of 2021 due to safety issues with the dock.

===By politicians===

Since it was formally dedicated in 1962, every U.S. President has made a pilgrimage to the memorial, presenting a wreath and scattering flowers over &quot;Arizona&quot; in honor of the Americans who perished there. On December 27, 2016, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe visited the memorial with President Barack Obama and paid respects to fallen service members there. Abe is the first Prime Minister of Japan to visit the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial, 75 years after the Japanese attack. It was a reciprocate visit to Obama&#x27;s visit of Hiroshima Peace Memorial on May 27, 2016 as the first visit by a sitting U.S. President. When Abe planned the visit, he mistakenly thought he would be the first sitting Prime Minister to visit Honolulu, not knowing three of his predecessors paid quiet but official visits in 1951, 1956 and 1957, including his grandfather in 1957. To ensure Abe&#x27;s visit would be unprecedented, the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial was chosen.

==Honors==

Every United States Navy, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine vessel entering Pearl Harbor participates in the tradition of &quot;manning the rails.&quot; Personnel serving on these ships stand at attention at the ship&#x27;s guard rails and salute the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial in solemn fashion as their ship slowly glides into port.

&quot;Arizona&quot; is no longer in commission, but is an active U.S. military cemetery. As survivors of the attack on &quot;Arizona&quot; pass away, many choose either to have their ashes scattered in the water over the ship, or to have their urns placed within the well of the barbette of Turret No. 4. As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship.
The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; National Memorial was one of the nine major historical sites incorporated into the wide-ranging World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, established by Congress in 2008 and dedicated on December 7, 2010. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act divided the monument by the three states in which it was located, naming the Hawaii site as Pearl Harbor National Memorial.

<doc id="704076" wikidata="Q349346" url="?curid=704076" title="George Shearing">
<text>Sir George Albert Shearing (13 August 191914 February 2011) was a British jazz pianist who for many years led a popular jazz group that recorded for Discovery Records, MGM Records and Capitol Records. Shearing was the composer of over 300 songs, including the jazz standards &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot; and &quot;Conception&quot;, and had multiple albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts during the 1950s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s.

==Early life==
Born in Battersea, London, Shearing was the youngest of nine children. He was born blind to working-class parents: his father delivered coal and his mother cleaned trains in the evening. He started to learn piano at the age of three and began formal training at Linden Lodge School for the Blind, where he spent four years.

Though he was offered several scholarships, Shearing opted to perform at a local pub, the Mason&#x27;s Arms in Lambeth, for &quot;25 bob a week&quot; playing piano and accordion. He joined an all-blind band, Claude Bampton&#x27;s Blind Orchestra, during that time, and was influenced by the records of Teddy Wilson and Fats Waller. Shearing made his first BBC radio broadcast during this time, after being befriended by Leonard Feather, with whom he started recording in 1937.

In 1940, Shearing joined Harry Parry&#x27;s popular band. Around 1942 he was recruited by Stéphane Grappelli (domiciled in London during World War II) to join his band, which appeared at Hatchets Restaurant in Piccadilly in the early years of the war, and subsequently toured as &quot;the Grappelly Swingtette&quot; from 1943 onward. Shearing won six consecutive Top Pianist &quot;Melody Maker&quot; polls from this time onward. Around that time he was also a member of George Evans&#x27;s Saxes &#x27;n&#x27; Sevens band.

==United States years==
Shearing immigrated to the United States, where his harmonically complex style mixing swing, bop and modern classical influences gained popularity. One of his first performances was at the Hickory House. He performed with the Oscar Pettiford Trio and led a jazz quartet with Buddy DeFranco, which led to contractual problems, since Shearing was under contract to MGM and DeFranco to Capitol Records.
In 1949, he formed the first George Shearing Quintet, a band with Margie Hyams (vibraphone), Chuck Wayne (guitar), later replaced by Toots Thielemans (listed as John Tillman), John Levy (bass), and Denzil Best (drums). This line-up recorded for Discovery, Savoy, and MGM, including the popular single &quot;September in the Rain&quot; (MGM), which sold over 900,000 copies in the United States alone with global sales in excess of one million; &quot;my other hit&quot; to accompany &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;. Shearing said of this hit that it was &quot;as accidental as it could be.&quot; At this time, the novelist Jack Kerouac heard him play in Birdland, and later described the performance in his 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot; as &quot;his great 1949 days before he became cool and commercial.&quot;

Shearing&#x27;s interest in classical music resulted in some performances with concert orchestras in the 1950s and 1960s, and his solos frequently drew upon the music of Satie, Delius, and Debussy for inspiration. He became known for a piano technique known as &quot;The Shearing Sound&quot;, or &quot;Shearing voicing&quot;, a type of double melody block chord, with an additional fifth part that doubles the melody an octave lower. With the piano playing these five voices, Shearing would double the top voice with the vibraphone and the bottom voice with the guitar to create his signature sound. This piano technique is also known as &quot;locked hands&quot; and the jazz organist Milt Buckner is generally credited with inventing it. In Shearing&#x27;s later career he played with a more conventional piano technique while maintaining his recognisable improvisational style.

In 1956, Shearing became a naturalised citizen of the United States. He continued to play with his quintet, with augmented players through the years, and recorded with Capitol until 1969. He created his own label, Sheba, that lasted a few years. Along with dozens of musical stars of his day, Shearing appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; in 1959&quot;.&quot; In 1953, he had appeared on the same network&#x27;s reality show, &quot;The Comeback Story&quot;, in which he discussed how to cope with blindness.

== Later career ==
In 1970, he began to &quot;phase out his by-now-predictable quintet&quot; and disbanded the group in 1978. One of his more notable albums during this period was &quot;The Reunion&quot; (1976), made in collaboration with bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Rusty Jones, and featuring Stéphane Grappelli, the violinist with whom he had debuted as a sideman decades before.

Later, Shearing played in a trio, as a soloist, and increasingly in a duo. Among his collaborations were sets with the Montgomery Brothers, Marian McPartland, Brian Q. Torff, Jim Hall, Hank Jones, Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen and Kenny Davern. In 1979, Shearing signed with Concord Records, and recorded for the label with Mel Tormé. This collaboration garnered Shearing and Tormé two Grammys, one in 1983 and another in 1984.

Shearing remained fit and active well into his later years and continued to perform, even after being honoured with an Ivor Novello Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. He never forgot his native country and, in his last years, would split his year between living in New York and Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, where he bought a house with his second wife, singer Ellie Geffert. This gave him the opportunity to tour the UK, giving concerts, often with Tormé, backed by the BBC Big Band. He was appointed OBE in 1996. In 2007, he was knighted. &quot;So&quot;, he noted later, &quot;the poor, blind kid from Battersea became Sir George Shearing. Now that&#x27;s a fairy tale come true.&quot;

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while performing at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club.

In 2004, he released his memoirs, &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;, which was accompanied by a double-album &quot;musical autobiography&quot;, &quot;Lullabies of Birdland&quot;. Shortly afterwards, however, he had a fall at his home and retired from regular performing.

On 14 February 2011, Shearing died from heart failure at 91.

In October 2011, Derek Paravicini and jazz vocalist Frank Holder performed a tribute concert to the recordings of Shearing. Ann Odell transcribed the recordings and taught Paravicini the parts, as well as being the MD for the concerts. Lady Shearing also endorsed the show, sending a letter to be read out before the Watermill Jazz Club performance.

== Personal life ==
Shearing was married to Trixie Bayes, with whom he had his only child Wendy, from 1941 to 1973. Two years after his divorce he married his second wife, the singer Ellie Geffert. He was a member of the Bohemian Club and often performed at the annual Bohemian Grove Encampments. He composed music for two of the Grove Plays.

<text>The  (Italian for &#x27;Basilica of the Holy Cross&#x27;) is a minor basilica and the principal Franciscan church of Florence, Italy. It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 metres southeast of the Duomo, on what was once marshland beyond the city walls. Being the burial place of notable Italians, including those from the Italian Renaissance such as Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli, as well as the poet Foscolo, political philosopher Gentile and the composer Rossini, it is also known as the Temple of the Italian Glories ().

==Building==
The basilica is the largest Franciscan church in the world. Its most notable features are its sixteen chapels, many of them decorated with frescoes by Giotto and his pupils, and its tombs and cenotaphs. Legend says that Santa Croce was founded by St Francis himself. The construction of the current church, to replace an older building, was begun on 12 May 1294, possibly by Arnolfo di Cambio, and paid for by some of the city&#x27;s wealthiest families. It was consecrated in 1442 by Pope Eugene IV. The building&#x27;s design reflects the austere approach of the Franciscans. The floorplan is an Egyptian or Tau cross (a symbol of St Francis), 115 metres in length with a nave and two aisles separated by lines of octagonal columns. To the south of the church was a convent, some of whose buildings remain.

The Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s. Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned.

In 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the interior of this area was rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church&#x27;s decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost. The Bardi Chapel which contained a cycle of frescoes of the life of St Francis was plastered over, at the behest of Cosimo I, and Vasari placed some new altars against the walls, causing considerable damage to the frescoes.

The bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning. The neo-Gothic marble façade dates from 1857 to 1863. The Jewish architect Niccolò Matas from Ancona designed the church&#x27;s façade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition. Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honoured with an inscription.

In 1866, the complex became public property, as a part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity.

Among the 19th-century restorations, the 16th-century altars and plaster were removed from the Bardi Chapel, revealing Giotto&#x27;s frescoes of the Life of St Francis, which include the &quot;Death of St. Francis&quot;. This painting, missing sections where an altar had been attached to the wall, was heavily restored in the 19th century. These restorations were later removed to reveal those areas which are definitively Giotto&#x27;s, leaving portions of the painting missing.

The Museo dell&#x27;Opera di Santa Croce is housed mainly in the refectory, also off the cloister. A monument to Florence Nightingale stands in the cloister, in the city in which she was born and after which she was named. Brunelleschi also built the inner cloister, completed in 1453.

In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the Badia Polyptych being carried out of the church. He reasoned that this had been removed from the Badia Fiorentina during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed in Santa Croce. Between 1958 and 1961, Leonetto Tintori removed layers of whitewash and overpaint from Giotto&#x27;s Peruzzi Chapel scenes to reveal his original work.

In 1966, the Arno River flooded much of Florence, including Santa Croce. The water entered the church bringing mud, pollution and heating oil. The damage to buildings and art treasures was severe, taking several decades to repair.

Today the former dormitory of the Franciscan friars houses the Scuola del Cuoio (Leather School). Visitors can watch as artisans craft purses, wallets, and other leather goods which are sold in the adjacent shop.

===Restoration===

The basilica has been undergoing a multi-year restoration program with assistance from Italy&#x27;s civil protection agency. On 20 October 2017, the property was closed to visitors due to falling masonry which caused the death of a tourist from Spain. The basilica was closed temporarily during a survey of the stability of the church. The Italian Ministry of Culture said that &quot;there will be an investigation by magistrates to understand how this dramatic fact happened and whether there are responsibilities over maintenance.&quot;

<text>Kristian-Joy Alfonso (born September 5, 1963) is an American actress, former figure skater, and fashion model. She is best known for playing the role of Hope Williams Brady on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1983 to 1987, 1990, 1994 to 2020, return appearances from 2023 to present). She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress (then known as Outstanding Ingénue) in 1985 for her role on &quot;Days&quot;. Alfonso also played Pilar Ortega on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1988 to 1990) and Lauren Ethridge on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1993 to 1994).

== Early life ==
Alfonso was born in Brockton, Massachusetts. Her grandparents hailed from Sicily and Calabria, giving her full Italian heritage. She has one sibling, an older sister. As a teenager, she was an above-average student. Her extra-curricular activities were focused on ice skating and dance classes. Alfonso won the gold medal in a figure skating championship when she was thirteen years old. After injuring her leg in a tobogganing accident, she had to give up skating and dancing. Alfonso soon received opportunities that led to a modeling career and eventually acting. She graduated from Brockton High School in 1982.

== Career ==

=== 1977–1981: Early work ===
After her skating career ended, Alfonso was signed to Wilhelmina Models. By the time she was fifteen, she had appeared on the covers of 30 international magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot; in 1979. Alfonso considered herself lucky to be working as a model because she stands at only 5 feet 4 inch long. She sometimes had to stand on apple boxes to appear taller.

Alfonso&#x27;s modeling work gained attention from NBC and she received her first acting role. She was cast as Kelly Blake in the television film &quot;The Star Maker&quot; (1981), co-starring with Rock Hudson. She was asked to audition for the role of Hope Williams on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, but she declined because she didn&#x27;t want to move to Los Angeles.

=== 1983–1986: &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; ===
In 1983, Alfonso had another opportunity to audition for the role of Hope on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and she took it. During her screen test, she tripped and fell down the staircase at the Horton house. The producers were charmed by her clumsiness and she was signed to a contract. Alfonso was the fifth actress to play Hope. The role had previously been played by Tammy Taylor in 1981. Alfonso&#x27;s first air date was April 14, 1983. 

The character of Hope Williams was paired with Bo Brady (played by Peter Reckell). &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; said the love story was &quot;classic in its origins and continues to make people melt: gruff boy from the wrong side of the tracks...tames the spoiled rich girl who was getting into all sorts of trouble.&quot; 

Alfonso won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Exciting Female Newcomer for her role on &quot;Days&quot; in 1984. She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress (then known as Outstanding Ingénue) in 1985. She also received Young Artist Award nominations in 1983, 1984, and 1985. 

In 1985, Alfonso guest starred on &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. In 1986, she and Peter Reckell received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Favorite Daytime Super Couple.

=== 1987-1994: Other work ===
Alfonso and Peter Reckell decided to leave &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, last airing in April 1987. The characters of Bo and Hope left Salem to sail around the world with their son, Shawn. After leaving &quot;Days&quot;, Alfonso made guest appearances on &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. She played Cassandra in the television film &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1988). From 1988 to 1989, she had recurring roles on &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;Full House&quot;. 

In 1988, Alfonso joined the cast of the CBS series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, playing Pilar Ortega. In April 1990, it was announced that she would return to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for a few months during a hiatus from &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. Since Peter Reckell was able to make a long term return to &quot;Days&quot; and Alfonso wasn&#x27;t, the character of Hope was killed off. 

Alfonso co-starred with Dolph Lundgren in the film &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; (also titled &quot;Army of One&quot;) (1993). She had a recurring role on &quot;Baywatch&quot;. From 1993 to 1994, Alfonso played the recurring role of Lauren Ethridge, a Hollywood madam, on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. She guest starred on &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. Alfonso played Chris Madigan in the television film &quot;&quot; (1994). She was considered to play figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in a television film.

=== 1994-2009: &quot;Days&quot; return ===
Alfonso returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, first airing May 6, 1994. She signed a long-term contract with the show. She received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination in 1996 for Hottest Actress for her role on &quot;Days&quot;. She played Jeanna in the film &quot;In the Kingdom of the Blind, the Man with One Eye Is King&quot;. In 1997, Alfonso played Chelsea Coals in the television film &quot;What Happened to Bobby Earl?&quot; She also appeared in the television film &quot;Steve.Oedekerk.com&quot;. 

In 1999, she won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Hottest Female Star for her role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. In 2000, she played her &quot;Days&quot; character, Hope Brady, on an episode of &quot;Friends&quot;. She also played Hope in the primetime special &quot;Days of Our Lives&#x27; 35th Anniversary&quot;. In 2000, Alfonso received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Favorite Actress. In 2001, Alfonso and Peter Reckell won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Favorite Couple. In 2002, they won a special Daytime Emmy Award, voted on by fans, for America&#x27;s Favorite Couple.

Alfonso played Mary Everly in the film &quot;Day of Redemption&quot; (2004). She and Peter Reckell were nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 2005, voted on by fans, for Most Irresistible Combination. She guest starred with Reckell, playing their &quot;Days&quot; characters, on an episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot; in 2009.

=== 2019-present ===
In November 2019, it was announced that the entire cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; had been released from their contracts. The show was put on an indefinite hiatus. In January 2020, the show was renewed for season 56. Alfonso returned as Hope in February 2020. &quot;Days&quot; suspended filming in mid-March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, Alfonso announced that she wouldn&#x27;t be returning to the show when it resumed production in September. In a statement, she said, &quot;It is now time for me to write my next chapter.&quot;

In October 2020, it was announced that Alfonso would join her former &quot;Days&quot; co-star Alison Sweeney in the Hallmark Channel film &quot;Chronicle Mysteries&quot;. In 2021, she joined the cast of Lifetime&#x27;s four-movie V. C. Andrews event, appearing in the episodes &quot;All That Glitters&quot; and &quot;Hidden Jewel&quot;. In July 2022, Alfonso returned to the role of Hope Brady in &quot;Days of Our Lives: Beyond Salem&quot;, a spinoff series streaming on Peacock. In 2023, she returned to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for a short time, along with her former co-stars Peter Reckell and Victoria Konefal. In April 2024, it was announced that Alfonso would make a brief return to &quot;Days&quot; for the funeral of Doug Williams (Bill Hayes), airing November 29.

== Personal life ==
Alfonso married Simon Macauley, a realtor, in 1987. They had a long distance marriage, with Macauley based in Sint Maarten and Alfonso working in Los Angeles. Their son was born in October 1990. They divorced in 1991.

She married Danny Daggenhurst on October 6, 2001. He is an attorney and chairman of a palm oil company in Bangkok. Their son was born in July 2002. Alfonso also has a stepson from Daggenhurst&#x27;s previous marriage.

<text>The Labour Representation League (LRL), organised in November 1869, was a forerunner of the British Labour Party. Its original purpose was to register the working class to vote, and get workers into Parliament. It had limited power, described by Eugenio Biagini as being &quot;very weak and quite ineffective&quot;, and was never intended to become a full political party. However, it played a role in supporting the election of Lib-Lab MPs. The first secretary was Cooperative Society activist and trade unionist, Lloyd Jones.

In 1874, the League won two parliamentary seats.

In 1886, the TUC created the Labour Electoral Association to replace the League; in turn, this led to the creation of the Labour Party.

<doc id="704084" wikidata="Q347159" url="?curid=704084" title="Kevin Moore">
<text>Kevin Moore (born May 26, 1967) is an American keyboardist, composer and the founder of the Chroma Key music project. He is also a former member of American progressive metal band Dream Theater, co-founder of the progressive rock supergroup O.S.I., and a composer of film soundtracks. Throughout his career, he has become known for his emotional music and lyrics, nomadic lifestyle and use of spoken word samples.

Moore started his music career in progressive metal band Dream Theater. He contributed music and lyrics to the band&#x27;s first three studio albums, but left the band during the mixing process of &quot;Awake&quot; to pursue his own musical interests. Starting with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Dead Air for Radios&quot;, he has released electronica, ambient music through his solo project Chroma Key. Moore has guested on several albums, including three Fates Warning albums. This led Moore to form OSI with Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos in 2002, a band which combines progressive metal with electronica. The fourth OSI album, Fire Make Thunder, was released in March 2012.

Moore has worked on other solo projects since leaving Dream Theater. While living in Costa Rica, he produced a bi-weekly radio program for Radio for Peace International; a compilation of this work was released as &quot;Memory Hole 1&quot;. While living in Turkey, Moore produced the debut album of Turkish band Makine and wrote soundtracks for two Turkish films. The soundtrack for the first film, &quot;Okul&quot;, was released in 2004 as &quot;Ghost Book&quot;. The soundtrack for the second film, &quot;Küçük Kiyamet&quot;, entitled &quot;Shine&quot;, was released in 2010.

==Early years==
Moore, who was born on Long Island, New York, began his music career in Kings Park, Long Island, learning piano at the age of six and writing his first song at the age of 12. After graduating from high school in 1985, Moore briefly attended SUNY Fredonia, where he studied classical music, before returning home to form the band Majesty with childhood friends guitarist John Petrucci and bassist John Myung, who had recruited drummer Mike Portnoy (a fellow Long Islander) during their short enrollment at Berklee College of Music. Singer Chris Collins handled vocal duties for Majesty, but he was subsequently replaced by Charlie Dominici (and eventually James LaBrie) and the band was renamed Dream Theater.

==Career==
===Dream Theater===
Dream Theater&#x27;s debut studio album was 1989&#x27;s &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;, which earned the group comparisons to well-known progressive rock bands such as Rush and Queensrÿche. Their big breakthrough, however, came in 1992 with the album &quot;Images and Words&quot;, featuring the band&#x27;s highest charting single to date, &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;. The song, which included lyrics by Moore, reached No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Following their relentless touring in support of the second album, the band also went on to release a live album, &quot;Live at the Marquee&quot;, and a video, &quot;Images and Words: Live In Tokyo&quot;. The video&#x27;s extensive documentary footage would subsequently introduce many fans to Moore&#x27;s ironic sense of humor.

In 1994, the band released its third studio album, &quot;Awake&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s highest charting album to date with Moore, reaching No. 32. The album featured Moore&#x27;s signature song, a haunting piano-driven ballad called &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;. Shortly before the album was mixed, though, Moore announced to the rest of the band that he wished to concentrate on his own musical interests and would be quitting Dream Theater. According to Portnoy, Moore became interested in the independence of working on his own as opposed to the compromise of a band environment. Although Dream Theater has since invited him to play reunion shows, Moore has said he prefers to move forward as opposed to looking back. He notably declined to take part in the official Dream Theater biography titled &quot;Lifting Shadows&quot;, despite involvement from every other former member of Dream Theater and various former associates of the group.

During his time in Dream Theater, Moore wrote the lyrics to songs on each of the band&#x27;s albums and also to some of the band&#x27;s demos and b-sides. On &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;, he wrote &quot;Light Fuse and Get Away&quot;, &quot;Only a Matter of Time&quot;, and parts of The Killing Hand&quot;. On &quot;Images and Words&quot;, he penned &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, &quot;Surrounded&quot;, &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot;, and parts of &quot;Metropolis—Part I: &#x27;The Miracle and the Sleeper&#x27;&quot;. On &quot;Awake&quot;, the songs &quot;6:00&quot;, &quot;Lie&quot;, and &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot; all featured his lyrics. Demos with his lyrics include &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Past Me, &quot;A Vision&quot; and &quot;Two Far&quot;.

===Chroma Key===
After leaving Dream Theater, Moore moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and started writing material for his solo album. A demo tape known as &quot;Music Meant to Be Heard&quot; was shared among fans, and the songs included many spoken-word samples from interviews Moore recorded during his cross-country travels. Most of these songs were later released in 1999 on a limited-edition CD called &quot;This is a Recording&quot;.

In 1998, Moore released his first solo album, &quot;Dead Air For Radios&quot;, under the name Chroma Key on his self-created record label, Fight Evil Records. Mark Zonder and Joey Vera of Fates Warning served as his support musicians for that record. The album featured a dark, ambient sound, closer to Peter Gabriel and Tori Amos than the complex and intricate Dream Theater style. In hindsight, Dream Theater fans noticed that Moore had subtly explored this style of composition in &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;.

In 2000, Moore moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded the digitally-themed &quot;You Go Now&quot;. The line-up for that record was Moore, David Iscove (guitars) and Steve Tushar (loops, programming). During his westcoast stay, Moore earned a BFA at California Institute of the Arts, where he created a little-known documentary called &quot;Octember Revolution&quot;, which depicted a Southern California gated community intervention. He then moved to Costa Rica, where he worked for Radio For Peace International, producing a bi-weekly activist radio program. In fact, some of Moore&#x27;s work on Radio for Peace International was later released in an internet-only album called &quot;Memory Hole 1&quot;.

In 2004, Moore scoured public domain films looking for one that exuded a certain mood, intending to write a pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was &quot;Age 13&quot;, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it. The resulting album is titled &quot;Graveyard Mountain Home&quot;, which included a DVD containing the movie set to Moore&#x27;s music.

===OSI===
In 2003, Fates Warning guitarist Jim Matheos invited Moore to work with him on a new musical project. Moore had worked with Matheos before, appearing as guest keyboardist on Fates Warning&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot;, 1997 album &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; and 2000 album &quot;Disconnected&quot;. The new project involved Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and Cynic bassist/Chapman Stick player Sean Malone. This would be the first time Moore had worked with Portnoy since leaving Dream Theater nearly 10 years earlier. The band that was formed was named OSI, and they released the album &quot;Office of Strategic Influence&quot;. Musically, it can be described as a mixture of Chroma Key&#x27;s dark, melodic focus with the guitars and heaviness of Fates Warning and Dream Theater. Moore assumed vocal duties.

In April 2006, Moore and Matheos released a second OSI album called &quot;Free&quot;, a collaboration made easier by Moore&#x27;s temporary relocation to Montreal, Canada. The album once again featured Portnoy on drums. Unlike the first OSI album, which was based on an information-spinning faction of the U.S. government, &quot;Free&quot; was about the personal relationships in Moore&#x27;s life. Shortly following the album&#x27;s release, OSI also released an EP that included remixes of three &quot;Free&quot; songs and a video of the title track. In the spring of 2006, Moore and Matheos alluded to possible tourdates in the support of the album, but nothing ever materialized.

In September 2008, Moore announced on his website that he had been working for several months with Jim Matheos and drummer Gavin Harrison (of the band Porcupine Tree) on the third OSI album. &quot;Blood&quot; was released in April 2009.

OSI&#x27;s fourth album, Fire Make Thunder, was released in March 2012.

===Film soundtracks===

In 2004, Moore relocated to Istanbul, Turkey, and composed the soundtrack to the horror film &quot;Okul&quot; (&quot;The School&quot;) which was subsequently released as a solo record titled &quot;Ghost Book&quot;. The music contained many traditional instruments stemming from Moore&#x27;s stays in Costa Rica and Turkey. In 2006, Moore once again teamed up with Turkish producers for another soundtrack project. The film, &quot;Küçük Kıyamet&quot; (&quot;The Little Apocalypse&quot;), tells the horrific tale of a family who decides to rent a summer house by the seaside. Its soundtrack CD &quot;Shine&quot; was self-released December 2010 after a funding campaign on Kickstarter Both films, &quot;Okul&quot; and &quot;Küçük Kıyamet&quot;, were based on books written by Turkish author Doğu Yücel.

===Other===
While in Turkey, he also produced a radio show along with Theron Patterson and Pınar Türen for Açık Radyo in Istanbul.

In March 2007, Moore played an hour-long concert, which was held at Turkey&#x27;s Balo Stage on March 23. It was described as a try-out to &quot;play some songs for a local crowd...with longer, more elaborate shows planned for the future.&quot; In April 2007, Moore announced plans to pre-produce the debut album of Turkish industrial rock band Makine which was released in April 2010.

Since 2015, Moore has had a Patreon page for Chroma Key, collecting crowdfunding for song releases.

In a 2019 interview, Dream Theater vocalist James LaBrie stated that he recently got in touch with Moore via texting, and stated that the former band mates are still friends.

==Influence==
In an April 2007 interview, Sonata Arctica keyboardist Henrik Klingenberg revealed that he was really influenced by Moore when he (Klingenberg) began playing rock music.
Television and film composer Roy Harter and producer/composer Michael J. Bazini (aka DJ Butterface) were among Moore&#x27;s private students during his early career with Dream Theater.

==Personal life==
In September 2013, Fates Warning vocalist Ray Alder revealed in an interview that Moore returned to the United States and studied to become a doctor. According to Alder, Moore was in his third year of medical school as of 2013.

Since 2020, Moore has been working as a psychiatrist at Trinity Health in Minot, North Dakota. He earned his Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine from Des Moines University in Iowa and completed his psychiatry residency at Garnet Health Medical Center in Middletown, New York.

<text>Philippsburg () is a town in the district of Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

==History==
Before 1623, Philippsburg was known as &quot;Udenheim&quot;.
The city was a possession of the Bishop of Speyer from 1316 to 1803. The town is named after Philipp Christoph von Sötern, who was bishop from 1610–1652. It was ruled by France between 1644 and 1676 and again between 1688 and 1697. The city became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1803.
Historically, possession of the town was disputed between Germany and France.
Formerly, there was a fortress located at the town, whose location was mentioned by Carl von Clausewitz. In Book VI of &quot;On War&quot;, he suggested that &quot;If a fortress cannot be located directly on a river, it is better not to place it in the immediate vicinity, but some fifty to sixty miles away; otherwise the river will cut through and interfere with its sphere of influence with respect to all the points mentioned above.&quot; He then mentions in a footnote &quot;Philippsburg was a perfect example of how not to site a fortress. Its location was that of an idiot standing with his nose against the wall.&quot;. The fortress was besieged in 1644, 1676, 1688, and 1734, and during the War of the Second Coalition in 1799. Following the Peace of Lunéville, the fortress was demolished.

==Miscellaneous==
The town is the site of the Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant and a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant.

<text>Box-Office Bunny is a 1991 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short film directed by Darrell Van Citters and starring Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd. It was shown in theaters alongside &quot;The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter&quot;, as well as on the subsequent home media releases for the film. It is Warner Bros.&#x27;s first Bugs Bunny theatrical release since 1964&#x27;s &quot;False Hare&quot;. It was issued to commemorate Bugs&#x27; 50th anniversary and is included as a special feature on the DVD for &quot;The Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot;. The short marks the debut of Jeff Bergman as the voice of Bugs, Daffy, and Elmer, following the death of Mel Blanc in July 1989.

== Plot ==
The action takes place in a massive movie theater, called &quot;Cineminium&quot;. It is a 100-screen multiplex, constructed right above Bugs&#x27;s rabbit hole. When Bugs surfaces within the theater, usher Elmer Fudd attempts to drive him away because Bugs did not purchase a ticket. Meanwhile, Daffy finds the admission fee of the multiplex too expensive, and instead uses his library card to force open a door and sneak inside, only to stumble into Elmer and Bugs. To divert attention from his own illegal entry, Daffy joins forces with Elmer against Bugs.

Following a chase through the movie theater, Bugs manages to trap his opponents within a projection screen and within the film depicted on it. It is apparently part of the slasher film subgenre and the trapped duo are confronted by a &quot;hockey-mask wearing, chainsaw-wielding maniac&quot;. This scares Daffy and Elmer as they try to escape. Bugs ends the cartoon by saying, &quot;It takes a miracle to get into pictures, and now these two jokers wanna get out.&quot;

During the Drum ending title, Daffy and Elmer break through the Drum in their attempt to escape the movie, and Bugs pokes out of the hole that they made and simply says to the audience, &quot;and that&#x27;s the end!&quot;.

== Cast ==
* Jeff Bergman as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd
* Jim Cummings as Actor in movie
* Tress MacNeille as Actress in movie

==Production notes==
In the late 1980s, Warner Bros. Animation started producing new theatrical animated shorts, featuring the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. &quot;The Duxorcist&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Night of the Living Duck&quot; (1988) were well-received individually. Both were then incorporated in the compilation film &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot; (1988). They were followed by &quot;Box-Office Bunny&quot;, the first theatrical short featuring Bugs Bunny since 1964.

According to director Darrell Van Citters, the Warner Bros. studio was uncertain what to do with the film. It was reportedly completed six to nine months before its actual release. Its release was delayed because the studio wanted to release it alongside one of their feature films, but could not decide which could best serve to spotlight it. It was finally released alongside &quot;The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter&quot; (1991). The underperformance of the feature film at the box office is thought to have negatively affected the fate of the short.

Kevin Sandler believes the short set an unfortunate pattern for subsequent releases. Later &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts were similarly attached to children&#x27;s films which under-performed, in each case dragging the short film with them to relative obscurity. He offers the examples of &quot;Chariots of Fur&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994), &quot;Carrotblanca&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Panda Adventure&quot; (1995), &quot;Superior Duck&quot; to &quot;Carpool&quot; (1996), and &quot;Pullet Surprise&quot; to &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1997). Staffers involved in the production of several of these shorts reportedly suspected that the studio already knew that these feature films were &quot;hard-to-market&quot;. From a marketing perspective, the shorts could then be used to attract additional viewers to the cinema. Sandler himself, however, suspected that Warner Bros. was simply not particularly interested in generating publicity for the animated shorts.

== Reception ==
Charles Solomon praised the film as &quot;funny, fast-paced, brightly colored&quot; and managing to capture the essence of the Bugs-Elmer-Daffy films by Chuck Jones without directly copying them. He found fault, however, with the concept of ending the film &quot;at just over five minutes&quot;.

<text>Thomas Burt PC (12 November 1837 – 12 April 1922) was a British trade unionist and one of the first working-class Members of Parliament.

==Career==
Burt became secretary of the Northumberland Miners&#x27; Association in 1863, then, in 1874, was returned to parliament for Morpeth, alongside Alexander MacDonald, a fellow miners&#x27; leader. Burt stood as a Radical labour candidate with Liberal support and formed part of a small group of Liberal–Labour politicians in the House of Commons in the 1880s and 1890s. After the 1892 General Election, William Ewart Gladstone appointed Burt as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in which capacity he served until 1895.

Despite the emergence of the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Representation Committee, Burt remained loyal to his backers in the Liberal Party and refused to join. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1906 and continued to represent Morpeth in Parliament until 1918. From 1910 to 1918 he was Father of the House in the House of Commons.

Burt resigned as general secretary of the Northumberland Miners&#x27; Association in 1913.

==Personal life==
Thomas Burt was born at Murton Row, near Backworth, in the county of Northumberland, on 12 November 1837. His father, Peter Burt, was at this time working as a coal hewer for the Backworth Coal Company. At the age of 10 Burt&#x27;s working life began as a trapper boy at the Haswell Pit. With only approximately two years schooling and at the age of 17 Burt decided &quot;how utterly ignorant I was and when I was seized with an eager desire for knowledge and mental improvement&quot;. In 1860 Burt married Mary Weatherburn and in the 1881 census they were listed as having three daughters and three sons; Rebecca aged 20, Mary aged 13, Thomas aged 11, Peter aged 8, Jane aged 6 and Wilfred aged 1. Poor health led to Burt&#x27;s retirement from politics in 1918. During the final three years of his life he was bed-ridden. Burt died on 12 April 1922, aged 84 and was buried in Jesmond Cemetery which was in the neighbourhood of his residence in Newcastle upon Tyne. On 12 April 2014 a re-dedication of the Thomas Burt Memorial took place in Jesmond Cemetery.

==Politics==

Formation of the Northumberland Miners&#x27; Mutual Confident Association which became the Northumberland Miners&#x27; Association.
In 1865 Burt was elected executive secretary of the Northumberland Miner&#x27;s Mutual Confident Association. Continuing as General Secretary of the association for the next fifty years. Burt was guest speaker at the 2nd Durham Miners&#x27; Gala and attended as a guest speaker on a regular basis in subsequent years. A march for universal manhood suffrage was held in Newcastle on 12 April 1873,: an estimated 80,000 union members marched through Newcastle to the Town Moor, here speakers included Burt. Burt stood on a Radical reform platform, he believed that the franchise should be extended and this would lead to the election of reform-minded MPs. He called for universal suffrage, which would include women, reapportionment of districts to provide roughly the same number of voters in each constituency, shorter duration of each Parliament and payment of MPs.

In 1874 Burt was elected as Member of Parliament for the Borough of Morpeth in Northumberland. He received 3,332 votes whilst his opponent Capt. F. Duncan received 585.
Burt gave his maiden speech on 13 May 1874 in support of G.O. Trevelyan&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill to &#x27;equalize franchise requirements by extending the borough franchise to the counties. In his speech which was to last fifteen minutes he declared &#x27;that the unfairness of the present law was evident to the miners of Northumberland. Of workers at the same colliery, miners residing in the borough could cast a ballot, while those living in the county could not. Also, because miners often moved from one colliery to another, they could easily lose the vote previously enjoyed&#x27;. Unfortunately on this occasion the bill was defeated.

After his election as MP, Burt was to split his time between London and his duties as representative for the Borough of Morpeth and Newcastle and his union role. He made sure he was in attendance for every important union meeting. In October 1874 the mine owners called for a twenty per cent reduction of wages, the union put forward a reduction of eight per cent. After arbitration the two sides settled on a wage reduction of fourteen per cent. In 1906, Burt was made a Privy Councillor. He lost the formal support of his own Union, in 1909, because he would not join the Labour Party.

==Legacy==
On 12 November 1987 on the 150th anniversary of his birth, Dr Eric Wade of the Open University gave the memorial address &#x27;Thomas Burt: His Life and Ideas&#x27;.
The Stephenson Railway Museum located near Murton Row, where Burt was born, has a steam locomotive which they named &#x27;Thomas Burt&#x27; in his honour.
The aged miners&#x27; homes at Choppington, under construction at the time of Burt&#x27;s death were named the Burt Memorial Homes.
The Northumberland Miners&#x27; Association named their Trade Union Offices building Burt Hall. The building - in Northumberland Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and now used by Northumbria University - was opened in 1895 and bears a plaque stating the hall &#x27;was built by the miners&#x27; in recognition of valuable service rendered by Thomas Burt M.P. as general secretary for 27 years, and to commemorate his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in 1892.&#x27; A block of flats in Bethnal Green, East London, is named after Thomas Burt.

<text>David Hayter is a Canadian-American actor, screenwriter, director, and producer. He is well known as the English-language voice actor for Solid Snake and Naked Snake in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; video game series. He wrote the film &quot;X-Men&quot; and co-wrote &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;, and was awarded the Saturn Award for Best Writing in 2000 for his work on &quot;X-Men&quot;. Hayter voiced King Shark on &quot;The Flash&quot;.

==Early life==
Hayter&#x27;s father, Stephen, worked in the pharmaceutical industry. David Hayter started acting at the age of nine. He spent most of his childhood living around the world, and moved to Kobe at the age of 15, graduating from its international Canadian Academy in 1987. After this, he attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for two years until transferring to the Toronto Metropolitan University in Toronto. He stayed there until the age of 20, when he moved to Hollywood.

== Career ==
=== Early acting career ===
Hayter did some live acting in the early 1990s, most notably in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Major Dad&quot;, but soon became more interested in voice acting and later landed the role of Captain America in the popular 1994 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series. He also provided the voice of Arsène Lupin III in the English version of the anime film &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and the voice of Tamahome in the English version of the anime series &quot;Fushigi Yūgi&quot;. He also starred in the 1994, straight-to-video movie, &quot;&quot;, as the protagonist, Sean Barker (a role he took over from the previous actor, Jack Armstrong); Hayter has since gone-on to use the character&#x27;s name as an alias in various work credits.

=== &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series ===
Hayter began providing the English voice of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series protagonist Solid Snake in the 1998 video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, which also served as the series&#x27;s transition from 2D to 3D. Hayter would go on to play Solid Snake and his progenitor Naked Snake throughout all the succeeding installments (including spinoffs, re-releases and adaptations) up to and including &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; (2010). Hayter also has an extended live-action cameo as himself in one of the fictional TV programs prior to the start of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; (2008); where he wears the &quot;Solid Eye&quot;, the technologically advanced eye patch that the main character wears throughout the game. Outside the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, Hayter also voiced the character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008).

His work with the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series has also led Hayter to do voice work in other video game projects such as &quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;. He cited the series as an influence on his screenwriting, stating that &quot;Kojima and I have different styles,&quot; &quot;but I&#x27;ve certainly learned things from him, especially about ambiguity and telling a story without giving all the answers.&quot;

Hayter is one of the few &quot;Metal Gear&quot; actors to have played and completed the games he&#x27;s voiced in. According to Paul Eiding, Hayter gave up half of his own paycheck in order to bring back the cast of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; for the 2004 remake &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;.

Following the announcement of &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; in the 2013 Game Developers Conference, Hayter announced that he was not asked to reprise as the main character for this entry. This was later confirmed when Konami announced that Kiefer Sutherland would be the character&#x27;s voice during E3 the same year. Hayter has since revealed in an interview that he had to re-audition for the role suggesting that the series&#x27; creator Hideo Kojima was already considering recasting the part much earlier, with Kurt Russell (Snake Plissken in &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;) having been allegedly offered the role during the development of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; (2004).

After Kojima&#x27;s departure from Konami, Hayter would reprise the role in a &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;-themed advertisement for the 2016 Ford Focus SE aired in 2016. In 2018, Hayter provided the character&#x27;s voice in two video games: &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot; (which added two playable characters based on both Solid Snake and Naked Snake in an update) and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (which simply reused his performance from &quot;Brawl&quot;).

=== Filmmaking ===

In 2000, he wrote the screenplay for the movie version of &quot;X-Men&quot;, for which he was awarded the 2000 Saturn Award for Best Writing, and then went on to co-write the screenplay for its sequel &quot;X2&quot; with writing team Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Shortly after his work on &quot;X-Men&quot;, Hayter was hired to write and direct a project based on the heroine Black Widow. However, due to the limited success of similar themed films featuring female vigilante protagonists at the time, Marvel withdrew their offer to Hayter stating, &quot;We don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s time to do this movie&quot;. Hayter&#x27;s daughter Natasha, born whilst he was writing the &quot;Black Widow&quot; script, is named after the titular character.

Hayter also wrote an adaptation of the graphic novel &quot;Watchmen&quot; by Alan Moore and David Gibbons. Noted for being a harsh critic of translations of his works to film, Moore said of the script &quot;David Hayter&#x27;s screenplay was as close as I could imagine anyone getting to [a film version of] &quot;Watchmen&quot;. That said, I shan&#x27;t be going to see it. My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It&#x27;s been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way.&quot; Hayter and writer Alex Tse shared credit on the finished screenplay. Tse drew &quot;the best elements&quot; from two of the project&#x27;s previous drafts written by Hayter. The script did not keep the contemporary atmosphere that Hayter created, but instead returned to the original Cold War setting of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; comic. Warner Bros. was amenable to the 1980s setting, and the director also added a title montage sequence to introduce the audience to the events of alternate history United States in that time period.

On September 7, 2012, it was announced that Hayter would pen the screen adaptation &quot;Caught Stealing&quot;, and would star Patrick Wilson and Alec Baldwin.

On September 13, 2012, Hayter began filming on his directorial debut, &quot;Wolves&quot;.

On July 8, 2013, Hayter was hired by Lakeshore Entertainment to write the film &quot;The Sword&quot;, based on the Image Comics series.

===Television===
On August 7, 2013, it was announced Hayter was developing a television show on Fox tentatively titled &quot;World War III&quot;, about a fiction global conflict that chronicles &quot;a perfect storm of world events places us in the center of a global battle which may bring the world as we know it to an end.&quot; Hayter will be writing the series&#x27; story bible and pilot episode, as well as producing and serving as showrunner.

On September 28, 2018, Hayter announced he was co-writing and producing the Netflix series &quot;Warrior Nun&quot;, based on the 1994 comic book series &quot;Warrior Nun Areala&quot;, with Simon Barry serving as series creator and showrunner. Season 1 debuted on Netflix on July 2, 2020.

On January 31, 2022, it was announced that Hayter would be writing and producing a television adaptation of the 2000 video game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;.

<text>Jallikattu (or Sallikkattu), also known as Eru Taḻuvuṭal and Manju-virattu, is a traditional event in which a zebu bull (&quot;Bos indicus&quot;), such as the Pulikulam or Kangayam breeds, is released into a crowd of people, and many people attempt to grab the large hump on the bull&#x27;s back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. They hold the hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases, they must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull&#x27;s horns or cross a finish line. 

Jallikattu is typically practised in some regions of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, particularly in southern Tamil Nadu, as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day, which occurs annually in January.

Because of incidents of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban on the sport, resulting in the Supreme Court of India banning it several times over the past years. However, with protests from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was enacted in 2017 to continue the sport. 

== Etymology ==
Ancient Tamil Sangams described the practice as (), literally &#x27;bull embracing&#x27;. The modern term () or () is derived from (&#x27;coins&#x27;) and (&#x27;package&#x27;), which refers to a prize of coins that is tied to the bull&#x27;s horns and that participants attempt to retrieve. () literally means &#x27;bull chasing&#x27;.

== History ==

 is known to have been practiced during the Tamil classical period (400–100 BCE). It was a cultural ritual among the &quot;Ayar&quot; tribal people who lived in the ‘Mullai’ geographical region of the ancient Tamil Nadu. Later, it became a platform for display of bravery, and prize money was introduced for participation encouragement. A seal from the Indus Valley civilization depicting the practice is preserved in the National Museum, New Delhi.

A cave painting in white kaolin discovered near Madurai depicting a lone man trying to control a bull is estimated to be about 1,500 years old.

An ancient tin coin discovered by a numismatist could be a fresh evidence of Jallikattu. R. Krishnamurthy, president of the South Indian Numismatic Society, estimated that the coin belongs to third or fourth century BCE. Since the coin was made of tin, which was then available only in South-East Asian countries.

Jallikkattus are very common between Thanjavur and Tiruchirappalli in the north and Tirunelveli and Ramanathapuram in the south, a region centered around the city of Madurai and populated for the most part by the Mukkulathor castes, who are the main participants in this ritual sport. Other landowning intermediate caste groups also enthusiastically participate, many of them bull owners and bull tamers.

In the Pudukkottai State, the Jallikattu was considered as a quasi religious function to be conducted to propitiate the village deities, and was usually held on any day after the Thai Pongal when harvesting was over and before the commencement of the Tamil New Year.

== &quot;Jallikattu&quot; venues ==

Well-known &quot;jallikattu&quot; venues include the following:

Out of these the Alanganallur &quot;Jallikattu&quot; is considered to be the most famous venue.

== Variants and rules ==

Some variants include:
*: This is the most common category of . The bull is released from a closed space () and the contestants attempt to wrap their arms or hands around the hump of the bull and hold on to it to win the award. Only one person is allowed to attempt at a time. This variant is most common in the districts of Madurai, Theni, Thanjavur, and Salem.
*: In this variant the approach is slightly different as the bull is directly released into open ground. The rules are the same as that of &quot;vadi majuviraṭṭu.&quot; This is a popular variant in the districts of Sivagangai and Madurai.
*: In this variant, the bull is tied with a rope ( means &#x27;circle&#x27; in Tamil). There are no other physical restrictions for the bull and hence it can move freely anywhere. The maximum time period given is 30 minutes. A team of seven to nine members can attempt to untie the gift token that is tied on the bull&#x27;s horn.

Bulls enter the competition area through a gate called the . Typically, participants must only hold onto the bull&#x27;s hump. In some variations, they are disqualified if they hold onto the bull&#x27;s neck, horns or tail. There may be several goals to the game depending on the region. In some versions, contestants must either hold the bull&#x27;s hump for 30 seconds or for . If the contestant is thrown by the bull or falls, they lose. Some variations only allow for one contestant. If two people grab the hump, then neither person wins.

== Breeding ==
&quot;Bos indicus&quot; bulls are bred specifically by people of the village for the event. Bulls that are able to participate successfully in the event are used as studs for breeding. These bulls also fetch higher prices in the markets.

== Training and preparation ==
=== Training ===
Kabaddi was played as a warm up sport before the players enter the arena for Jallikattu.

=== Preparation ===
With the introduction of the Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009, by the Tamil Nadu legislature, the following activities were done in preparation of the event:
# A written permission is obtained from the respective collector, thirty days prior to conduct of event along with notification of the event location.
# The arena and the way through which the bulls pass through is double-barricaded, in order to avoid injuries to the spectators and by-standers who may be permitted to remain within the barricades.
# The necessary gallery areas are built up along the double barricades.
# The necessary permissions are obtained from the collector for the participants and the bulls fifteen days prior.
# Final preparation before the event include a complete testing by the authorities of the Animal Husbandry Department, to ensure that performance enhancement drugs, liquor or other irritants are not used on the bulls.

==Animal rights concerns==
Between 2008 and 2014, 43 humans and 4 bulls were killed in the events. In 2017, there were 23 deaths in addition to about 2,500 human injuries and several instances of injury to the bulls. Year 2020 saw 5 deaths from participation in the event.

Animal rights and welfare concerns are related to the handling of the bulls before they are released and also during competitor&#x27;s attempts to subdue the bull. Practices before the bull is released include prodding the bull with sharp sticks or scythes, extreme bending of the tail which can fracture the vertebrae, and biting of the bull&#x27;s tail. There are also reports of the bulls being forced to drink alcohol to disorient them, or chilli peppers being rubbed in their eyes to aggravate the bull.

During attempts to subdue the bull, they are stabbed by various implements such as knives or sticks, punched, jumped on and dragged to the ground. In variants in which the bull is not enclosed, they may run into traffic or other dangerous places, sometimes resulting in broken bones or death. Protestors claim that is promoted as bull taming, however, others suggest it exploits the bull&#x27;s natural nervousness as prey animals by deliberately placing them in a terrifying situation in which they are forced to run away from the competitors which they perceive as predators and the practice effectively involves catching a terrified animal. Along with human injuries and fatalities, bulls themselves sometimes sustain injuries or die, which people may interpret as a bad omen for the village.

In his 2012 book &quot;Animal Rights Without Liberation&quot;, which analyses the use of animals in cultural practices and concerns about alleged hypocrisy, political theorist Alasdair Cochrane argues that culture cannot outweigh animal rights or outweigh animal interests in not being killed, even if this entails the destruction of cultures &quot;defined entirely by the grave harm [they cause] to animals&quot; and cites as an example to argue that culture or human interests cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering. An investigation by the Animal Welfare Board of India concluded that &quot; is inherently cruel to animals&quot;.

Animal welfare organisations such as the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) and PETA India have protested against the practice. The Indian Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi denied the claim by aficionados that the sport is only to demonstrate the &quot;Tamil love for the bull&quot;, citing that the Tirukkural does not sanction cruelty to animals.

==Ban, protests and authorization==

The Animal Welfare Board of India filed a case in the Supreme Court of India for an outright ban on because of the cruelty to animals and the threat to public safety involved.

On 27 November 2010, the Supreme Court permitted the Government of Tamil Nadu to allow for five months in a year and directed the District Collectors to make sure that the animals that participate in are registered to the Animal Welfare Board and in return the Board would send its representative to monitor the event. The Government of Tamil Nadu ordered that be deposited by the organizers in case of an accident or injury during the event and enacted a rule to allow a team of veterinarians be present at the venue for certifying the bulls for participation in the event and to provide treatment for bulls that get injured.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 2011 that banned the use of bulls as performing animals, thereby banning the event But the practice continued to be held under Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27 of 2009. On 7 May 2014, the Supreme Court of India struck down the State law and banned altogether. The Supreme Court noted that any flouting of the ban should result in penalties for cruelty to animals under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The court also asked the Government of India to amend the law on preventing cruelty to animals to bring bulls within its ambit. The Supreme Court also ruled that cruelty is inherent in these events, as bulls are not anatomically suited for such activities and making them participate is subjecting them to unnecessary pain and suffering, so such events were outlawed.

On 8 January 2016, the Ministry of Environment and Forests permitted the continuation of the tradition under certain conditions, effectively ending the ban. However, on 14 January 2016, the Supreme Court of India issued a stay on this order, upholding the ban, after a petition filed by the Animal Welfare Board of India and PETA India, leading to protests all over Tamil Nadu. The Supreme Court refused to review its decision on 26 July 2016.

On 16 January 2016, the World Youth Organization (WYO) protested at Chennai against the stay on the order overturning ban on conducting in Tamil Nadu. The WYO also demanded a ban on PETA in India.

On 8 January 2017, several hundreds of protesters conducted a rally at the Marina in Chennai opposing the ban on . The participants walked from the lighthouse to the labour statue bearing posters saying &quot;save &quot;. A few churches openly conducted prayer mass and rally against the Supreme Court ruling. Following the protests at Chennai, many students started rallies in various towns of Tamil Nadu.

After hearing the petitions which were led by the Animal Welfare Board of India challenging central government&#x27;s notification, the Supreme Court of India on 12 January ordered a stay, issued notices to the central government and the Tamil Nadu government and later refused to lift the stay. Numerous events were held across Tamil Nadu in protest of the ban, and hundreds of participants were detained by police in response. The Supreme Court has agreed to delay its verdict on for a week following the centre&#x27;s request that doing so would avoid unrest.

Due to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of events. On 23 January 2017 the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bipartisan bill, with the accession of the Prime Minister, exempting from the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960). The first legal under this exemption took place on 1 February in Alanganallur, Madurai district.

The legal situation surrounding is as yet not clearly resolved. Some, such as ex Ministry of External Affairs cabinet minister Salman Khurshid, have stated that the matter will only be truly resolved if the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is amended as local ordinances and state laws cannot trump Indian federal law. According to &quot;The Hindu&quot;, many other Indian legal experts agreed with Khurshid&#x27;s view, as federal laws such as the PCA are always more powerful than state laws, and in that respect the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the state law overturned in 2009. For its part, PETA India has said that it will &quot;study&quot; the new ordinance, and has not ruled out a challenge to the new law on the same grounds as it challenged the 2009 law. On Jan 25, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) started the legal process towards another ban by formally challenging the new law before the Supreme Court, but they withdrew the petition on Jan 26. According to the AWBI&#x27;s acting chairperson, AWBI does not plan to re-file the petition, but he claimed no knowledge of what other organizations, such as PETA, may do.

<text>Capital Boulevard is a major thoroughfare in Wake County, North Carolina. At various points along the route, it carries NC 50, U.S. Highway 70 (US 70), U.S. Route 401, and US 1. It links Downtown Raleigh with its northeastern suburbs. It is one of the busiest corridors in Raleigh, with 63 thousand average daily vehicles near its intersection with Interstate 440 (I-440).

==Route description==

Its southern terminus is at the northern edge of Downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, south of which the roadways continue as a pair of matched one-way streets, Dawson Street (southbound) and McDowell Street (northbound). At this point the road carries US 401, US 70 and NC 50. It begins as an urban expressway, with limited driveways and grade-separated interchanges through an industrial area north of Downtown, carrying two through lanes in each direction. Major interchanges in this area include, from south to north, Peace Street, Wade Avenue (where US 70 West and NC 50 North leave Capital Boulevard), Fairview Road, Wake Forest Road, Atlantic Avenue, and Yonkers Road.

At an interchange with I-440, it widens to four through lanes in each direction while also transitioning to a divided boulevard-grade roadway with signalized at-grade intersections and frequent driveways. At the I-440 interchange, US 1 joins going northbound. The section between I-440 and I-540 is heavily commercial, saturated with shopping centers, anchored by Triangle Town Center, a large shopping mall near the interchange with I-540. There is one interchange about half-way between I-440 and I-540, where US 401 splits on to Louisburg Road, leaving only US 1 on Capital Boulevard. North of I-540, the route becomes an arterial divided highway, with two lanes in each direction and a mixture of signalized intersections and grade-separated interchanges as it bypasses to the east of the Wakefield Plantation development of North Raleigh and to the west of the town of Wake Forest. Major intersections and interchanges in this section include an intersection with Falls of Neuse Road/South Main Street (US 1A) just south of Wake Forest, and two numbered interchanges with NC 98 and NC 98 Business (Exits 124 and 125 respectively).

Capital Boulevard ends at the Wake County line just to the north of Purnell Road, with the US 1 designation continuing on into Youngsville, Franklin County.

==History==

Capital Boulevard was originally named Downtown Boulevard as far north as its intersection with Wake Forest Road. North of Wake Forest Road, it was known as North Boulevard.

<text>Laurier Avenue (; Ottawa Road #48) is a central east west street running through Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Originally known as &quot;Maria Street&quot; (west of Waller) and &quot;Theodore Street&quot; (east of Waller), it was renamed in honour of Canadian Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Laurier House, the residence of Prime Ministers Laurier and William Lyon Mackenzie King, is located at the corner of Laurier Avenue East and Chapel Street.

==Route==
;Bronson Avenue to the Rideau Canal
Laurier runs through the heart of downtown Ottawa. The south side of Laurier from Bronson east is almost all high-rises, starting with residential towers at Bronson, and commercial and government office buildings further to the east. Located on the south side of Laurier, between Bank Street and O&#x27;Connor is the main building of the Canadian Department of Finance. The main branch of the Ottawa Public Library is located at the intersection of Laurier and Metcalfe, and Ottawa City Hall is on the south side of Laurier between Elgin Street and Queen Elizabeth Driveway. Next door to Ottawa City Hall is Cartier Square Drill Hall, from which the daily &#x27;Changing of the Guard&#x27; procession begins. The north side of Laurier, across from City Hall, is Confederation Square. Laurier Avenue was selected in 2011 as the first street in Ottawa to feature a fully segregated bike lane.

;Rideau Canal to Rideau River
The street crosses the Rideau Canal over the Laurier Avenue Bridge and passes the Department of National Defence Headquarters before heading through the campus of the University of Ottawa. It then goes through the neighbourhood of Sandy Hill, passing near many embassies. The embassy of Iraq (previously the embassy of Angola) is prominent on the corner of Laurier and King Edward. The street finally ends at Charlotte just before it meets the Rideau River, at Strathcona Park, quite near to the Russian embassy.

<doc id="704114" wikidata="Q6650472" url="?curid=704114" title="Little Italy, Ottawa">
<text>Little Italy is a neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and the cultural centre of Ottawa&#x27;s Italian community. Situated in Centretown West, it is bounded by Albert Street to the north, Carling Avenue to the south, the O-Train Trillium Line to the west, and approximately Bronson Avenue to the east, while the neighbourhood&#x27;s main commercial area is along Preston Street.

Little Italy is adjacent to Chinatown, whose business district centres on Somerset Street.

==History==
Little Italy was initially settled around 1900 by Italian immigrants. Following a fire at a small Murray Street chapel, the 1913 founding of St. Anthony of Padua Church at the corner of Booth Street and Gladstone Avenue cemented the immigrants&#x27; connections with the neighbourhood. Roughly between World War I and World War II, a second wave of Italian immigrants was joined by communities of Ukrainian and Polish immigrants in the area. In recent years with the integration of European immigrants, the neighbourhood has found itself home to Asian immigrants, primarily from China and Vietnam.

In the 1960s a large section of the poorer neighbourhood was demolished, and replaced with the High School of Commerce, today the Adult High School in 1967. Since 1975, each June the neighbourhood hosts the Italian Week festival, Ottawa&#x27;s celebration of Italian culture.

In 2018, Ottawa&#x27;s tallest tower, the Claridge Icon, was built to the south end of the neighborhood at the intersection of Preston and Carling. Nearly a dozen projects are either proposed, approved or under construction, including three buildings that will claim the top three spots on the city&#x27;s list of tallest buildings. These projects are fueled by a recent service improvement announcement for the O-Train Trillium Line which will result in an eight-minute headway between trains at Carling Station as well as a new community design plan calling for high density near the transit station.

==Culture==
Two area streets have been given commemorative Italian street names. Gladstone Avenue is also called &quot;Via Marconi&quot;, and Preston Street is called &quot;Corso Italia&quot;.

<text>Ephraim McDowell (November 11, 1771 – June 25, 1830) was an American physician and pioneer surgeon. The first person to successfully remove an ovarian tumor, he has been called &quot;the father of ovariotomy&quot; as well as founding father of abdominal surgery.

==Early life==
McDowell was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, the ninth child of Samuel and Mary McDowell. His father was a veteran of the French and Indian War and a colonel during the American Revolution. In 1784 Samuel McDowell was appointed land commissioner and moved his family to Danville, Kentucky. There, he presided over ten conventions that resulted in the drafting of the Kentucky Constitution. Samuel was the 2nd great-grandfather of First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, making her Ephraim McDowell&#x27;s great-grandniece.

McDowell received his early education at the classical seminary of Worley and James, then spent three years as a medical student under Dr. Alexander Humphreys in Staunton, Virginia. He attended lectures in medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, from 1793 to 1794 and studied privately with John Bell. He never received a diploma, but in 1825, the University of Maryland conferred on him an honorary M.D. degree.

==Career==
In 1795, McDowell returned from Scotland, settled in Danville, Kentucky, and began his practice as a surgeon. McDowell perfected the modern surgical technique of lithotomy, for removal of stones obstructing the urinary bladder. One of his most famous patients was James K. Polk, for whom he removed a urinary stone and repaired a hernia.

===First ovariotomy===
On December 13, 1809, McDowell was called to see Jane Todd Crawford in Green County, Kentucky, from Danville. Her physicians thought that Mrs. Crawford was beyond term pregnant. McDowell diagnosed an ovarian tumor. Crawford begged him to keep her from a slow and painful death. He then described her condition and that an operation for cure had never been performed. He said that the best surgeons in the world thought it impossible. Crawford said she understood and wanted to proceed. McDowell told her he would remove the tumor if she would travel to his home in Danville. She agreed and rode the 60 miles on horseback.

On Christmas morning, 1809, McDowell began his operation. The surgery was performed without benefit of anesthetic or antisepsis, neither of which was then known to the medical profession. The tumor McDowell removed weighed . He determined that it would be difficult to remove completely, so he tied a ligature around the fallopian tube near the uterus and cut open the tumor. He described the tumor as the ovarium and fimbrious part of the fallopian tube very much enlarged. The whole procedure took 25 minutes. Crawford made an uncomplicated recovery. She returned to her home in Green County 25 days after the operation and lived another 32 years. This was the first successful removal of an ovarian tumor in the world.

As a Presbyterian, McDowell&#x27;s response to this event was recorded in one of his biographies:
How is it that I have been so peculiarly fortunate with my patients of this description?, I know not; for, from all the information I can obtain, there has not one individual survived who has been operated, on elsewhere, for diseased ovaria. I can only say that the blessing of God has rested on my efforts.

All attempts at abdominal exploration before 1809 had resulted in peritonitis and death. Descriptions of McDowell include phrases like &quot;neat and clean&quot; or &quot;scrupulously clean.&quot; He was not only neat, but meticulous. In his report on the operation, he described the removal of blood from the peritoneal cavity and bathing the intestines with warm water. 
McDowell did not publish a description of his procedure until 1817, after he had performed two more such operations. This was widely criticized in the English surgical literature. There is evidence that he performed at least 12 operations for ovarian pathology.

&quot;Having never seen so large a substance extracted, nor heard of an attempt, or success attending any operation such as this required, I gave to the unhappy woman information of her dangerous situation. The tumor appeared full in view, but was so large we could not take it away entire. We took out fifteen pounds of a dirty, gelatinous looking substance. After which we cut through the fallopian tube, and extracted the sac, which weighed seven pounds and one half. In five days I visited her, and much to my astonishment found her making up her bed.&quot;
=== Later career ===
From 1809 and 1818, McDowell wrote about four separate ovariotomies following Crawford&#x27;s. All four were performed on enslaved women, three of whom survived and one of whom died. It is unclear whether the enslaved women he performed surgeries on gave consent or received sufficient time to recover following the procedure.
==Personal life==
In 1802, McDowell married Sarah Shelby, daughter of war hero and two-time Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby. They had two sons and four daughters. He was a slaveholder.

McDowell played a prominent role in his community. He was also a founder, original corporator, and member of the primary board of trustees of Centre College in Danville. McDowell became a member of the Philadelphia Medical Society in 1817. McDowell was the great-great-grandfather of General John Campbell Greenway, whose statue was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection by the state of Arizona in 1930. He was cousin to woman&#x27;s suffrage leader Madeline McDowell Breckinridge.

McDowell was a Presbyterian but became an Episcopalian and founded Trinity Episcopal Church in Danville, Kentucky, having donated the land for its first building.

==Death==
In June 1830, McDowell was stricken with an acute attack of violent pain, nausea, and fever. He died on June 25, most likely a victim of appendicitis. His wife died 18 years later. They were buried at &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Rest&quot;, the homestead of Isaac Shelby, south of Danville, Kentucky but were reinterred in 1879, near a monument dedicated to him in Danville.

==Honors==
* In 1879, a monument in his honor was erected by the Medical Society of Kentucky in Danville.
* In 1929, Isaac Wolfe Bernheim donated a bronze statue of McDowell by Charles Henry Niehaus to the state of Kentucky for placement in the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. The statue depicts the ovarian tumor that McDowell removed from Jane Crawford, sitting in a bowl on the table behind McDowell. An identical statue by the same artist stands in the rotunda of the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort, Kentucky.
* In 1959, on December 3, the U.S. Post office first issued a 4-cent commemorative stamp honoring McDowell, in the Danville, Kentucky, post office, marking the 150th anniversary of the first successful ovarian operation.
* McDowell&#x27;s house, office, and apothecary in Danville are preserved as a museum and are designated a National Historic Landmark.
* Ephraim McDowell Regional Medical Center in Danville is named in his honor.

<text>Guernésiais (), also known as Guerneseyese, Dgèrnésiais, Guernsey French, and Guernsey Norman French, is the variety of the Norman language spoken in Guernsey. It is sometimes known on the island simply as &quot;patois&quot;. As one of the langues d&#x27;oïl, it has its roots in Latin, but has had strong influence from both Old Norse and English at different points in its history.

There is mutual intelligibility (with some difficulty) with Jèrriais speakers from Jersey and Continental Norman speakers from Normandy. Guernésiais most closely resembles the Norman dialect of Cotentinais spoken in La Hague in the Cotentin Peninsula of France.

Guernésiais has been influenced less by Standard French than Jèrriais, but conversely more so by English. New words have been imported for modern phenomena: e.g. and .

There is a rich tradition of poetry in the Guernsey language. Guernsey songs were inspired by the sea, by colourful figures of speech, by traditional folk-lore, as well as by the natural environment of the island. The island&#x27;s greatest poet was George Métivier (1790–1881), a contemporary of Victor Hugo, who influenced and inspired local poets to print and publish their traditional poetry. Métivier blended local place-names, bird and animal names, traditional sayings and orally transmitted fragments of medieval poetry to create his (1831). Denys Corbet (1826–1910) was considered the &quot;Last Poet&quot; of Guernsey French and published many poems in his day in his native tongue, both in the island newspaper and privately.

The most recent dictionary of Guernésiais, by Marie de Garis, was published in 1967 and revised in 1982.

==History==
Guernsey was a part of Normandy until the latter was conquered by French kings; a form of the Norman language developed in the Channel Islands and survived for hundreds of years. Guernésiais is considered to be one of the langues d&#x27;oïl, which includes French and its closest relatives. Later, after the separation of Guernsey and Normandy, French Protestant refugees escaped to the island from fear of persecution in mainland France; they quickly gained influence and positions of power in education, religion, and government. This accounts for the long tradition of a diglossic relationship between French and Guernesiais whereby French had prestige while Guernesiais did not.

The English language began to spread in Guernsey in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, during which there was a significant outposting of English soldiers on the island as well as an increase of English tourism and immigration. With the German occupation of Guernsey from 1940 to 1945, Guernesiais suffered more of a decline because children were evacuated off the island, which resulted in Guernesiais not being transmitted to much of their generation. It is from this point onwards that Guernesiais continued to decline in use and so, according to the 2001 census conducted in Guernsey, only 2.2% of the population at the time reported being fluent in Guernesiais.
*Guernsey poet George Métivier (1790–1881) – nicknamed the &quot;Guernsey Burns&quot;, was the first to produce a dictionary of the Norman language in the Channel Islands, the &quot;Dictionnaire Franco-Normand&quot; (1870). This established the first standard orthography – later modified and modernised. Among his poetical works are &quot;Rimes Guernesiaises&quot; published in 1831.
*Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte published the Gospel of Matthew by George Métivier in Dgèrnésiais in London in 1863 as part of his philological research.
*Like Métivier, Tam Lenfestey (1818–1885) published poetry in Guernsey newspapers and in book form.
*Denys Corbet (1826–1909) described himself as the &quot;Draïn Rimeux&quot; (last poet), but literary production continued. Corbet is best known for his poems, especially the epic &quot;L&#x27;Touar de Guernesy&quot;, a picaresque tour of the parishes of Guernsey. As editor of the French-language newspaper &quot;Le Bailliage&quot;, he also wrote feuilletons in Dgèrnésiais under the pen name &quot;Badlagoule&quot; (&quot;chatterbox&quot;). In 2009 the island held a special exhibition in the Forest Parish on Corbet and his work acknowledging the centenary of his death and unveiling a contemporary portrait painting of the artist by Christian Corbet a cousin to Denys Corbet.
*Thomas Martin (1839–1921) translated into Guernésiais the Bible, the plays of William Shakespeare, twelve plays by Pierre Corneille, three plays by Thomas Corneille, twenty seven plays by Molière, twenty plays by Voltaire and &quot;The Spanish Student&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
*Thomas Henry Mahy (1862–21 April 1936) wrote &quot;Dires et Pensées du Courtil Poussin&quot;, a regular column in &quot;La Gazette Officielle de Guernesey&quot;, from 1916. A collection was published in booklet form in 1922. He was still publishing occasional pieces of poetry and prose by the start of the 1930s.
*Thomas Alfred Grut (1852–1933) published &quot;Des lures guernesiaises&quot; in 1927, once again a collection of newspaper columns. He also translated some of the Jèrriais stories of Philippe Le Sueur Mourant into Dgèrnésiais.
*Marjorie Ozanne (1897–1973) wrote stories, published in the &quot;Guernsey Evening Press&quot; between 1949 and 1965. Some earlier pieces can be found in &quot;La Gazette de Guernesey&quot; in the 1920s.
* Ken Hill translated many of Marjorie Ozanne&#x27;s short stories and poems into English with the Guernsey accent of the early 20th century. The work was published by the Guernsey society.
*Métivier&#x27;s dictionary was superseded by Marie de Garis&#x27; (1910–2010) &quot;Dictiounnaire Angllais-Guernésiais&quot;; first edition published in 1967, supplements 1969 and 1973, third edition 1982.
*When the Channel Islands were invaded by Germany in World War II, Dgèrnésiais experienced a minor revival. Many Guernsey people did not always wish the occupying forces to understand what they were saying, especially as some of the soldiers had knowledge of English.
*Victor Hugo includes the odd word of Dgèrnésiais in some of his Channel Island novels. Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot; (), is credited with introducing the Guernesiais word for octopus, , into the French language (standard French for octopus is &quot;poulpe&quot;).
*A collection of short stories &quot;P&#x27;tites Lures Guernésiaises&quot; (in Guernésiais with parallel English translation) by various writers was published in 2006.

== Current status ==
The 2001 census showed that 1327 (1262 Guernsey-born) or 2% of the population speak the language fluently while 3% fully understand the language. However most of these, 70% or 934 of the 1327 fluent speakers, are over 64 years old. Among the young only 0.1% or one in a thousand are fluent speakers. However, 14% of the population claim some understanding of the language.
*L&#x27;Assembllaïe d&#x27;Guernesiais, an association for speakers of the language founded in 1957, has published a periodical. Les Ravigoteurs, another association, has published a storybook and cassette for children.
*Forest School hosts an annual speaking contest of the island&#x27;s primary school children (Year 6).
*The annual Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for performances in the language, and radio and newspaper outlets furnish regular media output.
*There is some teaching of the language in voluntary classes in schools in Guernsey.
*Evening classes are available, as of 2013.
*Lunchtime classes are offered at the Guernsey Museum, as of 2013.
*Along with Jèrriais, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Manx and Scots (in Scotland as well as the Ulster Scots dialects), Guernésiais is recognised as a regional language by the British and Irish governments within the framework of the British–Irish Council.
*BBC Radio Guernsey and the &quot;Guernsey Press&quot; both feature occasional lessons.
* A Guernésiais language development officer was appointed (with effect from January 2008).

There is little broadcasting in the language, with ITV Channel Television more or less ignoring the language, and only the occasional short feature on BBC Radio Guernsey, usually for learners. In 2021 BBC Radio Guernsey broadcast a 10 minute news bulletin once a week in Guernésiais.

In 2022 a documentary on the future of Guernsey French was produced for BBC radio.

The creation of a Guernsey Language Commission was announced on 7 February 2013 as an initiative by government to preserve the linguistic culture. The Commission has operated since Liberation Day, 9 May 2013.

== Revitalization ==
While Guernesiais does not have status as an official language of the island, revitalization efforts are still being undertaken on a small scale. One group, , organizes activities and events that celebrate Guernesiais. The Eisteddfod cultural festival is a public event where attendees can enjoy plays, poems, and music performed in Guernesiais. There is also a local choir on Guernsey called who conduct musical performances in Guernesiais to further promote the language and the cultural and linguistic heritage of Guernsey.

In 2007, efforts to revitalize Guernesiais were undertaken at an official level, when the government appointed a Language Support Officer (LSO), albeit with ambiguous direction. The position was only held until 2011; after that, there was no replacement and instead a Language Commission was formed in order to support efforts to revitalize Guernesiais by smaller groups.

==Bible translations==
*George Métivier translated the Gospel of Matthew into Guernésiais, which was published in London in 1863.
*Thomas Martin translated the whole Bible into Guernésiais, although this has never been published.

==Phonology==
* may also be heard as a tap sound .
* are heard by different dialects as well as older speakers as palatalized plosives .

* Vowel sounds may also be heard as near open .

Metathesis of is common in Guernésiais, by comparison with Sercquiais and Jèrriais.

Other examples are (promenade), (present), (tripod).

==Verbs==
, have (auxiliary verb)

, to love (regular conjugation)

<text>Susan Seaforth Hayes (born Susan Seabold; July 11, 1943) is an American television actress. She is best known for her portrayal of Julie Williams on the NBC drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and her intermittent portrayal of Joanna Manning on the CBS daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. She began playing the role of Julie on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1968, and is the only actress to appear on the show for all seven decades it has been on the air. Seaforth Hayes still regularly appears on &quot;Days&quot; as Julie.

==Career==

Susan Seaforth grew up in Hollywood, where she was active in theater as a teenager. Her mother, Elizabeth Harrower (1918–2003), was an actress and screenwriter who eventually became a part of the writing teams of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Her father, Harry Seabold, lived with his bride for 90 days during World War II, through his basic training near Oklahoma City. He shipped out after his daughter was conceived and remained overseas for thirty-three months; during this time, Harrower returned to her family home in Berkeley.

Seaforth Hayes had a number of featured roles on prime-time television in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Seaforth appeared in the TV series &quot;Cheyenne&quot; in the episode, &quot;The Bad Penny&quot;, portraying a young murderess avenging the hanging of her outlaw father. She appeared as Martha Otis, the wife of Jim Otis (Gil Peterson) in 1967 in &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;. She guest starred in &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and &quot;Matlock&quot;. She made a guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in 1962 as title character Helen Gregory in &quot;The Case of the Stand-in Sister.&quot; In the mid-1960s, she appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the flirtatious Dorothy Bradley (1964). She gave a moving performance as the expectant Holly, who was fleeing her outlaw husband while falling in love with Dev, his bounty hunter played by Dennis Hopper, on &quot;Bonanza&quot; S5 E31 &quot;The Dark Past&quot;, which aired in May 1964. She also appeared in Wagen Train S8E14, ‘The Echo Pass Story.’ She then appeared on &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot; as Carol West (1965).
In 1968, she appeared in Season 4, Episode 12, of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; as Delilah (The Night of Miguelito’s Revenge). She played opposite Michael Dunn as Dr. Loveless. 

She is best-known for her work on the daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in the role of Julie Olson Williams, which she played continuously from 1968 to 1984 and again from 1990 to 1993, with recurring appearances in 1994 and 1996. Since 1999, she has appeared on the show in a recurring capacity, often doing double duty between &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, in one case appearing on both shows on the very same day, a feat possible because of their different shooting and airing schedules.

She is the only actress to appear on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in all seven decades that it has been in production. In between appearances, she starred from November 1984 to May 1989 as Joanna Manning, mother to Tracey E. Bregman&#x27;s character, Lauren Fenmore, on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and as District Attorney Patricia Steele on &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; in that show&#x27;s final months on the air.

The role of Stephanie Forrester on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; was created for her by former &quot;Days&quot; headwriter William J. Bell. When she turned it down, her former &quot;Days&quot; costar Susan Flannery took the role. However, when the character of Lauren Fenmore crossed over, Seaforth Hayes did reprise her role of Joanna Manning on that show for one episode in 2003, and made several return appearances as that character on &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, as Lauren&#x27;s storyline required the character to be there.

Most recently, Seaforth Hayes made a cameo appearance in a music video for Chip Chocolate&#x27;s &quot;Cookie Dance&quot; as Mrs. Fields.

For her work on &quot;Days&quot;, Seaforth Hayes has received four Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, in 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1979; and two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, in 2018, and 2020. On April 29, 2018, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences presented Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes with Lifetime Achievement Awards at the 45th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. She was voted Best Actress in &quot;Daytime TV&quot;&#x27;s Annual Reader&#x27;s Poll in 1976, 1977, and 1978. Additionally, in 1977, she won two Soapy Awards for Actress of the Year and Favorite Heroine. She was awarded Photoplay Gold Medal Awards in 1977 and 1978, for Favorite Daytime Female Star. She earned a degree in history from L.A&#x27;s City College, and the stack of books at her deskside reflects an intense interest in the American West and diverse Native American cultures. Seaforth Hayes has lectured at universities in Los Angeles and Boston.

Her onscreen and real-life romance with co-star Bill Hayes (Doug Williams) was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press (they were married from 1974 until Hayes&#x27; death in 2024). The characters of Doug and Julie were &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;&#x27;, as well as daytime TV&#x27;s, first supercouple, and are widely believed to be the first supercouple on the American daytime serials. Their appearance together on the January 12, 1976 cover of &quot;Time&quot; was the only time daytime actors have appeared there. They also made an appearance on &quot;Password Plus&quot; in 1979.

In 2005, she and Hayes published their joint autobiography, &quot;Like Sands Through the Hourglass&quot;.

<text>Frances Reid (December 9, 1914 – February 3, 2010) was an American dramatic actress. Reid acted on television for nearly all of the second half of the 20th century. Her career continued into the early 2000s.

Although she starred in many productions, she is best known for her portrayal of Alice Horton on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from its debut in November 1965 until 2007. At the time of her death, she ranked fifth on the all-time list of longest-serving soap opera actors in the United States.

==Biography==
Reid was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, and raised in Beverly Hills, California. Her acting career started in 1938 with a bit part in the movie &quot;Man-Proof&quot;.

Reid&#x27;s Broadway debut was as Juliette Lecourtois in &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Will There&#x27;s a Way&quot; at the John Golden Theatre in 1939. She later played Roxane opposite Jose Ferrer&#x27;s Cyrano in the 1946 Broadway production of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; at the Alvin Theatre, repeating the role three years later, again opposite Ferrer, in a 1949 one-hour The Philco Television Playhouse adaptation.

A member of The Actors Studio from its inception in 1947, Reid played a variety of stage roles throughout the 1940s and 1950s. From 1954 to 1955, Reid played the title role in the CBS television version of the radio serial &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot;.

She next portrayed the grasping Grace Baker, the mother-in-law of Penny Hughes, on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1959 to 1962, and Rose Pollack, the kind-hearted mother of Nancy Pollock Karr, on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; in 1964. Reid portrayed matriarch Alice Horton on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; since the show&#x27;s premiere on November 8, 1965. Reid gained mainstream attention for a 2003–2004 storyline in which Alice and several other long-running characters were seemingly murdered. Her last appearance on &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; was on December 26, 2007, although she remained on contract with the show until her death.

Reid made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; starring Raymond Burr. In 1963 she played murderer Miss Givney, secretary to the guest attorney and episode&#x27;s title character played by Bette Davis in &quot;The Case of Constant Doyle.&quot; In 1965 she played defendant Lucille Forrest in &quot;The Case of the Golden Venom.&quot;

In 1966, Reid appeared opposite Rock Hudson in the John Frankenheimer drama &quot;Seconds&quot;. In the audio commentary for the DVD version of the film, Frankenheimer called Reid one of his favourite actresses.

Reid played frontier Doctor Katy Piper on the &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episode &quot;The Katy Piper Story&quot;, which aired on April 10, 1965.

==Marriage==
Reid was married to actor Philip Bourneuf from June 27, 1940, until their divorce in 1973.

==Death==
Reid died in Beverly Hills, California, in an assisted living facility, aged 95, on February 3, 2010.

==Awards==
Nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Supporting Actress in 1979 and for Lead Actress in 1987, Reid was awarded a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004. She won the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award for Outstanding Actress in a Mature Role in 1978, 1979, 1984, and 1985, and was inducted into the Television Academy&#x27;s archives in 2003.

<text>The Beli Dvor (, lit. &quot;White Palace&quot;) is one of two residences of the Dedinje Royal Compound in the Dedinje neighborhood of Belgrade. It was the official residence of the Prince Regent Paul from 1934 to 1941.

==History==
The palace was commissioned by and built with the personal funds of King Alexander I as the residence for his three sons: Crown Prince Peter (the future King Peter II and father of current Crown Prince Alexander), Prince Tomislav and Prince Andrew. Alexander I was assassinated in 1934 in Marseille during a state visit to France, in the same year that the construction of the palace began. Supervision of construction was overtaken by the Prince Regent Paul until its completion in 1937. The Queen Maria and her three sons, continued to reside at Kraljevski Dvor during this time. Prince Paul was the only member of the royal family to reside in the palace before the outbreak of the World War II and subsequent invasion of Yugoslavia.

Following the end of the war, the new communist government seized the assets and property of the royal family. The Beli Dvor was used by Yugoslav president, Josip Broz Tito, and later by the president of FR Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milošević, for official state functions and receptions of visiting foreign dignitaries. Milošević received U.S. envoy Richard Holbrook at the palace before the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began; Milošević later officially resigned his presidency in front of the Main Hall&#x27;s fireplace.

==Architecture==
The palace was designed by architect Aleksandar Đorđević in a Neo-palladian style, inspired by 18th century English country houses such as Ditchley Park. Its interior was decorated with English Georgian and 19th century Russian antiques by the French design firm Maison Jansen, which later decorated the White House during the administration of John F. Kennedy.

==Art collection==
Palace is housing notable art collection including paintings by Piero di Cosimo, Biagio d&#x27;Antonio, Nicolas Poussin (three paintings), Giovanni Cariani, Sébastien Bourdon, Albrecht Altdorfer, Titian, Rembrandt attribution, Palma Vecchio (two paintings), Carlo Caliari, Peter Paul Rubens, Carel Fabritius, Simon Vouet, two paintings by Brueghel, Antonio Canaletto, Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Giuseppe Crespi, Nicolae Grigorescu, Franz Xaver Winterhalter, Eugène Fromentin, Gaspard Dughet, Richard Parkes Bonington, Đura Jakšić, Ivan Meštrović, Vlaho Bukovac and others. The green and white Sèvres porcelain service was purchased in 1932 in Paris from the Gallerie Charpentier. The service once belonged to the Count of Artois.

<doc id="704135" wikidata="Q5604788" url="?curid=704135" title="Greenway Plaza">
<text>Greenway Plaza is a business district located along Interstate 69 (U.S. Highway 59) within the Interstate 610 loop in southwestern Houston, Texas, west of Downtown and east of Uptown. The district is located immediately west of Upper Kirby, north of West University Place, and south of River Oaks.

First envisioned in the late 1960s by local developer Kenneth L. Schnitzer, Greenway Plaza has evolved into one of Greater Houston&#x27;s largest employment centers, with over of office space on a campus. Noted for its expansive green spaces and consistent modernist architectural style, Greenway Plaza is widely considered a pioneering example of mixed-use development in the United States. The campus&#x27;s ten office towers are connected by an extensive system of air-conditioned skyways, tunnels, and underground parking garages.

Greenway Plaza contains Lakewood Church, a nondenominational Christian church, which hosts one of the largest congregations in the United States. Lakewood&#x27;s main campus, a venue originally known as &quot;The Summit&quot; and later &quot;Compaq Center,&quot; is the former home of the Houston Rockets, a professional basketball team, as well as other sporting teams, concerts, and events. Lakewood Church purchased the property in 2005.

The Greenway Plaza development is part of a larger neighborhood, Greenway/Upper Kirby, which covers a area roughly enclosed by Westheimer Road to the north, Bissonnet Street to the south, Uptown Houston to the west, and Shepherd Drive to the east. In 2015, Greenway/Upper Kirby had an estimated population of 21,120 and a population density of .

==History==
Kenneth L. Schnitzer, the chairperson of the Century Development Corporation, envisioned Greenway Plaza, which became the first mixed-use development in Houston.

Century took realtors from outlying towns around Houston and had them buy individual parcels for very inexpensive prices while trying not to attract attention. One homeowner found out about the plan and asked to have the house sold for $350,000. At the time it was a lot of money for a house that was small. The company paid the money so it could secure the tract the house sat on. The grand opening took place in 1973. Schnitzer said that Greenway Plaza would become a &quot;second downtown&quot;. Bill Schadewald of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that Greenway Plaza, which housed office towers, retail operations, a basketball arena, a movie theater, and a hotel, &quot;defined the multiuse concept in an original &quot;Edge City&quot;&quot;.

In 1970, the M. W. Kellogg Company had moved its headquarters from New York to Houston. After Kellogg moved its operations into Greenway Plaza, initially Kellogg occupied half of 3 Greenway Plaza and staffed the half with fewer than 600 employees. When the energy industry expanded worldwide, Kellogg occupied all of 3 Greenway Plaza and space in an adjacent building. Kellogg&#x27;s lease on July 1, 1991 was up for renewal; if Kellogg had renewed the lease, its rent payment would have increased. Instead Kellogg decided to swap office space with its parent company, Dresser Industries. Dresser took over a part of Kellogg&#x27;s lease and renamed 3 Greenway Plaza to the Dresser Tower. After the swap Dresser occupied of space on eight floors, while Kellogg continued to lease six floors in the building. In exchange Kellogg took space formerly held by Dresser at the M. W. Kellogg Tower in the Cullen Center in Downtown Houston. The swap satisfied Dresser&#x27;s need for less space.

Around 1996 T Mobile leased space in 2 Greenway Plaza.

Circa 2003 the Houston Rockets moved out of what was the Compaq Center, and that building became the Lakewood Church Central Campus. Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that the adjacent Greenway Plaza became &quot;sleepy&quot; as a result of this change, and that in 2017 Greenway Plaza had a lack of activity during nighttime periods despite its heavy activity during the day; therefore, according to Sarnoff, Greenway Plaza &quot;feels like downtown Houston did 10 or 20 years ago&quot;.

In 2004 Crescent attempted to sell a 50% equity position in both Greenway Plaza and Houston Center. During that year, El Paso Corp., a major tenant with in Greenway Plaza, announced that it was vacating the property and moving its personnel to its Downtown Houston headquarters. A &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; article stated that El Paso was expected to sublease the space until 2014, when its lease will expire.

In 2005 the internet service provider Internet America had offices in Greenway Plaza.

During the afternoon of Monday July 29, 2013, Cousins Properties, a company based in Atlanta, announced that it was buying the entire Greenway Plaza complex and a Downtown Fort Worth office tower. Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that Cousins was expected to pay $1.1 billion in cash. By 2017 the owner was Parkway Inc., which planned to renovate Greenway Plaza.

In July 2017 T-Mobile announced it was moving to the T-Mobile Tower, formerly the River Oaks Tower. That same month Occidental Petroleum announced it was vacating its space, and it put its space for sale.

<doc id="704136" wikidata="Q2409688" url="?curid=704136" title="The House of the Dead III">
<text>is a 2002 horror-themed light gun arcade game and the third installment of the &quot;House of the Dead&quot; series of video games, developed by Wow Entertainment and Sega. It was ported to the Xbox in 2003, Microsoft Windows in 2005, the Wii in 2008 in a compilation with &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot;, and PlayStation 3 in 2012 with PlayStation Move support. The game was remade with typing controls as The Typing of the Dead 2 in 2008. The game continues the story of the previous games and introduces new gameplay concepts. The game&#x27;s secondary protagonist is Lisa Rogan, daughter of Thomas Rogan and Sophie Richards.

==Plot==
In 2019, 21 years after the events of the 1998 Curien Mansion incident, a zombie infestation has spread across the world, resulting in the collapse of civilization and leaving the world in utter desolation. A paramilitary force led by retired AMS agent Thomas Rogan head to a desert wasteland in an unnamed U.S. state on a mission to infiltrate the EFI Research Facility, once owned by Dr. Curien, and investigate its connection to the current state of the world. During the course of the raid, all members of Rogan&#x27;s team are killed except for his second-in-command, Captain Dan Taylor; both agents continued with the mission and reach a giant laboratory, where they find the source, but are attacked by the Death, a gigantic zombie security guard protecting the facility, who kills Taylor. Injured from the encounter, Rogan is assisted by an unknown individual before all communication with him is lost.

Two weeks later, on October 31, Rogan&#x27;s daughter, Lisa, and his former partner, Agent &quot;G&quot;, travel to the facility to rescue him. While navigating through the facility, they fend off against hordes of undead creatures before they encounter Death, whom they fight twice. Later, they fight a deformed mutant sloth named the Fool while locked in a cage, where it was feeding on the bodies of dead scientists, and a mutated tendril-covered plant named the Sun. Along the way, Lisa muses to &quot;G&quot; how she has to live in the shadows of her well-known father and that she is often the subject of his comparison.

Throughout the game, flashbacks reveal Curien&#x27;s motivation in his obsession of studying matters of life and death that resulted in him triggering the Curien Mansion&#x27;s outbreak back in 1998; he was desperate in searching for a cure to treat his son, Daniel, who was suffering from a terminal illness. His increasingly unethical methods led him to believe he would be able to change the world for a better future by developing the mutation.

After more fights, Lisa and &quot;G&quot; reunite with Rogan. They are met by the same individual who approached Rogan in the prologue, revealed to be Daniel Curien, who laments his father&#x27;s experiments that destroyed the world. After Rogan reveals on how Daniel tended to him, G gets Rogan to safety, while Daniel and Lisa form an alliance to destroy an electrokinetic entity known as the Wheel of Fate, engaging in a brutal showdown with a zombified Dan Taylor along the way. When they reach the same giant laboratory where Rogan was injured, Daniel reveals that the Wheel of Fate is actually his father Dr. Curien&#x27;s body, which underwent a 19-year resurrection process following his death by the Magician, adding that he hacked the program used in its creation some time prior to Lisa and G&#x27;s arrival, in order to prevent it from being released and destroying the world, saying that the future belongs to the people who are still alive and fighting. The two fight and manage to defeat and kill the Wheel of Fate, which explodes.

===Endings===
The game has four endings, each played depending on the player&#x27;s performance and the final path they took in the game.

*For players who achieve a ranking of B, C, D, or E, they will be rewarded with an ending which shows &quot;G&quot;, Lisa, and Rogan leaving the facility with Daniel, who states that he will not let his father&#x27;s efforts go to waste and will come back to the EFI lab if humans go down the wrong path again. This is considered to be the canonical ending of the game.

*The second ending is essentially the same as the first, except that Daniel loses the will to go on and transforms into a zombie in front of the horrified Lisa. This occurs when a player&#x27;s rank consists of (three or more) A or S ranks and if the player defeated Death as the Chapter 4 boss.

*The third ending shows Daniel and Lisa discovering that a zombie had stolen Lisa and G&#x27;s van, wherein Lisa gives chase with Daniel following her while G and Rogan watch from a distance. This occurs when a player&#x27;s rank consists of (three or more) A or S ranks and if the player defeated Sun as the Chapter 4 boss.

*The fourth ending depicts a mysterious man in a business suit (eventually revealed to be Thornheart from &quot;House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn&quot;) entering the laboratory where the Wheel of Fate battle took place and picking up one of Curien&#x27;s vials, muttering that Curien did not understand its true purpose. This occurs only when a player&#x27;s rank consists of (three or more) A or S ranks and if the player defeated Fool as the Chapter 4 boss.

==Gameplay==
&quot;The House of the Dead III&quot; departs from the original games in many ways, including weaponry; player characters are equipped with shotguns, rather than the semiautomatic pistols used in the first two games. The shotgun used in the Xbox version of &quot;III&quot; no longer requires the traditional &quot;point off-screen&quot; reload, but rather reloads automatically. Reloading still takes time, but happens without prompt as soon as the gun needs it. The arcade version differs here, because there is the presence of light guns, allowing for similar speedy reloading. A reload is achieved by pumping the shotgun controller. While playing the game on Xbox, the light gun controller released by Madcatz may be used; however, the traditional &quot;shoot off-screen&quot; reload was reintroduced in the Wii version.

A branching storyline existed in the previous games, but was handled differently. In &quot;The House of the Dead III&quot;, the player is given options for navigating through the game prior to the start of most stages, ultimately going through the same areas with different results dependent on the order chosen.

Another important difference is the absence of civilians. Unlike the first two &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; games, in which players could rescue various people in peril, &quot;The House of the Dead III&quot; contains no extra personnel beyond those central to the plot. Instead, &quot;Rescue Events&quot; occur during each stage in which players will need to rescue their partners from attacking zombies. An extra life is rewarded for each successful rescue. If all rescue events are successful, players find crates in the room before the final boss that, when shot, drop a lot of bonuses and lives.

A new concept of the series comes in the form of a &quot;Cancel&quot; bar. In previous installments, the bosses&#x27; weak point would only need to be shot once to stun the attack. In this game, the bosses&#x27; weak point must be shot repeatedly to drain the &quot;Cancel&quot; bar and stop the enemy&#x27;s attack.

Another major change to the gameplay comes in the form of a new rank and grade system. Players are now graded on how fast they dispose of the zombies, ranging from Excellent, Good, Faster, and Twin Shot, the last taking place if two zombies are killed with the same shotgun shell. A letter grade is also given at the end of each stage, ranging from S, A, B, C, D and E. Completing the stage with an A rank will award the player with an extra life, while an S rank will reward the player with two. A final grade is given at the end of the game, and depending on how many S ranks were received for each stage, the player may be given a &quot;SS&quot; rank as the final grade.

Extra lives and bonus points are also handled differently. In the previous arcade installments, nothing would happen if a player had all five lives and gained another. Now the player can have up to nine lives at a time, and any additional lives are turned into bonus points. In the previous games, bonus points could also be gained by shooting hidden objects such as a golden frog, or coin. &quot;The House of the Dead III&quot; expands upon this, introducing a silver coin that can be shot repeatedly, a wind-up robot that must be shot several times, and a golden miniature version of the recurring boss The Magician. Decaying zombies and weak points on stunned bosses can also be shot repeatedly for gaining extra points.

On the Xbox, PC, PlayStation 3 and Wii versions, there is a &quot;Time Attack&quot; mode where the player&#x27;s lives come in the form of a timer, starting at 45 seconds. Excellent, Good, Faster and Twin Shots give extra time, as do clocks in the background, successful rescue events and end-of-stage bonuses. Getting hit by a zombie subtracts 7 seconds, projectiles subtract 5, and bosses subtract 15. Stunning a boss grants the player 10 seconds. Every successful hit on the final boss also grants two seconds, and does not require a stun. The game cannot be continued if the timer reaches zero, and at the end of each game Dr. Curien gives his analysis of the player&#x27;s performance. The player may also note the average distance at which they managed to hold back the undead in metres.

==Development==
Early previews of the game utilized Cel shading for the graphical style, with vibrant colors and solid outlines. Later previews showed a modified art style, still utilizing, in the words of the developers, &quot;lit, cel-shaded effects&quot; but with &quot;a more realistic polygonal form.&quot; This too was further modified in development and the final game uses more realistic shading in line with its predecessor.

==&quot;The Typing of the Dead 2&quot;==

&quot;The Typing of the Dead 2&quot; is a revision of &quot;The House of the Dead III&quot;, and the second &quot;The Typing of the Dead&quot; game. It was released in Japan for Microsoft Windows on March 6, 2008. While &quot;The House of the Dead III&quot; is a light gun shooter, &quot;Typing&quot; replaces the gun with the keyboard. The game is an educational game, as it requires players to enhance their typing skills to be successful.

==Reception==

The game was met with mixed to positive reviews upon release. GameRankings gave it a score of 70.72% for the Xbox version, 56.50% for the PC version, and 63.63% for the PlayStation 3 version. Likewise, Metacritic gave it a score of 72 out of 100 for the Xbox version and 64 out of 100 for the PS3 version.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the Xbox version a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and praised it for &quot;the ability to mow down multiple enemies at once, enhanced graphics, a variety of endings and new creatures.&quot; The Digital Fix gave the PS3 version a score of seven out of ten and called it &quot;a fun game to blast through, especially in two player mode, and on the PS3 the game is as close to arcade perfection as you are ever likely to get.&quot;

<text>John Burnet (March 1781 or 20 March 1784 – 29 April 1868) was a Scottish engraver and painter.

==Life==
Son of the Surveyor-General of Excise of Scotland, Burnet was born either in Edinburgh in 1781 or in Fisherrow in 1784. He was apprenticed to the engraver Robert Scott and later trained at the Trustees Academy.

In 1806, he moved from Edinburgh to London, where he became an established painter of portraits, landscapes, and rural genre scenes.

Between 1808 and 1862, he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the British Institution and with the Society of British Artists and was finally awarded a fellowship to the Royal Society.

As an engraver he provided illustrations for editions of Robert Burns’s poems and Walter Scott’s &quot;Waverley&quot; novels.

He engraved copies of paintings of several notable portraits and artists.

He also wrote manuals and books on drawing, painting and artists, retiring from public life in 1860. He died in London.

<text>Jennie Lynn Finch-Daigle (born September 3, 1980) is an American former softball player. She played for the Arizona Wildcats softball team from 1999 to 2002, where she won the 2001 Women&#x27;s College World Series and was named collegiate All-American. Finch was a member of the United States women&#x27;s national softball team that won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics and the silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. She also pitched for the Chicago Bandits of the National Pro Fastpitch from 2005 to 2010.

Finch is ranked in several categories for both the Wildcats in the Pac-12 Conference and the NCAA Division I, where she was named #2 Greatest College Softball Player. She is the National Pro Fastpitch career leader in WHIP and is a National Softball Hall of Fame inductee. She has been ranked by Tucson, Arizona sportswriters as the #1 Best Arizona Wildcats Softball Player; picked the #5 Best NCAA Pitcher All-Time and was chosen by the Pac-12 for the All-Century Team as a pitcher.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine described her as the most famous softball player in history. In 2010, Finch retired from softball to focus on her family. In August 2011, she started working at ESPN as a color commentator for National Pro Fastpitch and college softball games.

==Early life and education==
Jennie was born in La Mirada, California. Finch has two older brothers, Shane and Landon Finch. She began playing softball at age five and pitching at age eight. Her father was her first pitching coach. Growing up, Finch was a bat girl for the University of California, Los Angeles. At La Mirada High School, Finch lettered four times in softball and twice each in basketball and volleyball. As a senior, she was the captain of all three sports. As a sophomore, she was an All-California Interscholastic Federation Division II choice in softball and All-Suburban League selection. In 2016, La Mirada retired her jersey number—the school&#x27;s first for a softball player.

==University of Arizona==
Finch majored in communications.

===Freshman===
Finch began her career on February 5, 1999, winning a run-rule game against the UIC Flames. She achieved a career high in doubles and threw her first career no-hitter during the NCAA tournament on May 22 vs. the Texas State Bobcats. Though they made the World Series, Finch and the Wildcats were eventually eliminated by the DePaul Blue Demons on May 29.

===Sophomore===
For her sophomore year, Jennie Finch was named a 2000 National Fastpitch Coaches Association First Team All-American and First Team All-Pac-10. She also threw three no-hitters and led the Wildcats in home runs and slugging percentage and achieved a career best in hits and batting average. Finch began the year with a 21 consecutive game win streak; in a 10–2 run-rule over the Southern Miss Golden Eagles on February 6 to a shutout win over Cal State Northridge Matadors on April 13. After suffering her only losses in back-to-back games, Finch finished the year 8–0 starting a new streak with an April 29 victory vs. the Oregon Ducks that would span the next two seasons. Finch&#x27;s 23rd and 29th wins were over the No. 1 Washington Huskies, the latter began a 35 scoreless inning streak, after allowing runs in the fourth inning she shutout the team the rest of the way for a 4–2 margin on May 27.

===Junior===
she is a good player in all Sporters As a junior in 2001, Finch was again named First Team for the NFCA and the conference, adding the Pitcher of the Year award. She would also hoist the Honda Sports Award for Softball Player of the Year. Finch&#x27;s season ERA, wins and shutouts were and still do rank top 10 for the school. Along with a no-hitter and career highs in WHIP and RBIs, Finch opened the season with 31 consecutive scoreless innings spanning 6 wins that combined with the innings from her last game in 2000, was a career best 35 before being snapped in the second inning by a leadoff home run vs. McNeese State Cowgirls on February 24. On March 30, Finch hit two home runs and a double in an 11–1 romp of the Oregon Ducks to drive in a career best 9 RBIs, which tied her third all-time in the NCAA for a single game. On April 8, Finch won her third game over a No. 1 team, the UCLA Bruins.

Finch and the Wildcats were the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament and made it to the World Series for a third straight year with Finch in the circle. She recorded victories over the California Golden Bears and the Oklahoma Sooners to reach the finals. In a 1–0 shutout of the UCLA Bruins, Finch set an NCAA record with a perfect season capped with the National Championship. Finch also had a hit in the game and was named MVP for the series. The victory extended her win streak to 40 consecutive games along with the 8 to end the 2000 season. Her season was voted by Arizona Wildcats fans as the Best Individual Season for softball.

===Senior===
For a final season, Finch was named 2002 First Team for the NFCA and the Pac-10 conference as well as Pitcher of The Year and Honda Sports Award for softball. Finch tossed three no-hitters and broke the season strikeouts record, while her wins and shutouts were and remain top-10 school records. Beginning on February 9 vs. the Cal State Fullerton Titans, Finch matched her own record of 35 consecutive scoreless innings that was broken in a 13–1 mercy win over the Northern Iowa Panthers on February 23.

===Legacy===
Finch set several records in single games beginning with a new NCAA record by winning her 51st consecutive game. A near-capacity crowd filled Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium and chants of &quot;Jennie&quot; echoed throughout the crowd in the 6–0 victory over Cal State Northridge. Finch said, &quot;It&#x27;s significant and it&#x27;s nice. But it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the team goal of winning a national championship.&quot; For one of her no-hitters, Finch posted her 100th career victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish on March 14. Later on March 24, she struck out 15 of the ULL Ragin&#x27; Cajuns for a career best in regulation; the Wildcats won, 7–2. On April 17, Finch won a 1–0 shutout in 9-innings and struck out 19 Oklahoma Sooners to tie a then school record. The Wildcat then beat the No. 1 UCLA Bruins by one run on April 6 to start the year 20–0 and set an NCAA record with 60 straight wins dating back to the 2000 season, including four wins over the No. 1 ranked team. To open a return trip to the WCWS as defending champion, Finch shutout the Nebraska Cornhuskers and ended the game with her 1,000th career strikeout. In the semifinals of the World Series, Finch hit her 50th career home run off Leslie Malerich to score the winning run and help herself beat the FSU Seminoles in 11-innings. The Wildcats suffered a 6–0 loss in the championship to the California Golden Bears.

Finch left the program the career leader in strikeouts, shutouts, innings pitched and tied for no-hitters (8), while ranking in the top-10 in most other pitching categories. She also was top-10 in home runs, RBIs and walks; she remains top-10 in several pitching and the walks all-time lists. She currently is 6th and 7th in winning percentage (0.881%) for a career in the now-named Pac-12 and the NCAA.

Finch&#x27;s prolific career at the WCWS included appearances all four years with the Wildcats and included a 7–2 record, 70 strikeouts, three shutouts, allowing 17 earned runs, 41 hits and 27 walks for 1.83 ERA and 1.04 WHIP in 65.0 innings. At the plate she also contributed 5 hits, a home run and two walks.

Her jersey number, 27 (the date of her parents&#x27; first date), was retired by the University of Arizona in a pre-game ceremony at Hillenbrand Stadium on May 9, 2003.

==2004 Olympics==
Finch was a member of the USA softball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. As a pitcher she posted a 2–0 win–loss record striking out 13 batters in eight innings while giving up only one hit, one walk and no runs. Her pitching helped lead the American team to the gold medal.

==2008 Olympics==
The USA team started its bid for a fourth straight gold medal at the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing with Finch pitching four no-hit innings in an 11–0 victory over Venezuela. Finch then pitched 5 shutout innings in a 7–0 victory over Chinese Taipei and two more shut out innings in a 9–0 victory over China. However, the U.S. lost 3–1 to Japan in the final game and came home with a silver medal. After the loss, Finch said, &quot;I feel like we let USA softball down. Many women have worn this uniform, and accepted nothing but gold.&quot; Along with baseball, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided in 2005 to drop softball from the Olympics, making 2008 possibly the last time the sport is played in the Olympics, before it will be reinstated in 2020. A crusader for softball&#x27;s reinstatement for the 2016 Olympics, Finch said that &quot;[i]t deserves to be an Olympic sport.&quot; After the final game, Finch said:

==National Pro Fastpitch==
Finch pitched for the Chicago Bandits of the National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) softball league. She was named NPF&#x27;s Co-Pitcher of the Year in 2005, sharing the award with teammate Lauren Bay. She also threw her first career no-hitter in a win over the Stratford Brakettes that same year. With a perfect season, Finch extended the streak in 2006 before opening 2007 with a loss. Finch won 15 consecutive games with 104.1 innings pitched, allowing 51 hits, 12 earned runs, 21 walks and whiffing 127 batters to post a 0.80 ERA and 0.69 WHIP.

Finch holds the league&#x27;s season ERA crown, which she set in 2007. On May 29, in a 1–0 12-inning loss to the Rockford Thunder, Finch struck out 17 and combined with Cat Osterman for a total of 41 strikeouts to set a single-game record for the combined total. On August 1, she set a career high with 16 strikeouts in a regulation win against the Michigan Ice. August 15, she set a career best with 18 more strikeouts to defeat the Rockford Thunder in 9-innings.

She pitched a perfect game for the Bandits in 2009 against the Philadelphia Force and another perfect game on July 9, 2010 against the Akron Racers. That year, Finch was named All-NPF. Finch currently leads in career WHIP and is top-10 all-time in strikeouts, ERA, strikeout ratio and fielding percentage. The Chicago Bandits played their home games in Rosemont, Illinois, at 27 Jennie Finch Way where her jersey is also retired.

==Manager==
On May 29, 2016, Finch was the guest manager of the Atlantic League&#x27;s Bridgeport Bluefish for the day, thus becoming the first woman to manage a professional baseball team. The team played and won one game.

==Media==
In 2002, ESPN called Finch the &quot;runaway winner&quot; of the Best Dressed competition at the Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Awards.

In 2003, Finch received the most votes in an ESPN online poll as the most attractive female athlete.

In 2004, &quot;People&quot; magazine named Finch one of its &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot;, the only female athlete in the list. &quot;This is truly amazing to be recognized by &quot;People&quot; magazine for this honor,&quot; Finch said. &quot;It is really special to be included among some of the most famous and beautiful people in the world. I still have a hard time believing that I was selected as part of this group.&quot; Finch also appeared in an episode of season 5 of the TV series The Parkers.

Finch has modeled swimwear for the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition&quot; in 2005. Finch was offered lucrative contracts to disrobe for &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, but turned them down.

&quot;This Week in Baseball&quot; signed Finch as a co-host. In a segment called the &quot;Jennie Challenge&quot;, Finch pitches to Major League Baseball players and often strikes them out. In softball, the mound is closer to home plate than baseball and Finch&#x27;s pitches are the equivalent of a 98 mph pitch. &quot;Some big-timers refuse to face her,&quot; Cal Ripken Jr. says. &quot;Many feel it could be embarrassing.&quot; In an interview with ESPN, Finch explained, &quot;I was throwing them mostly rise balls and change-ups. They&#x27;ve never seen a pitch like that, you know? With the closer distance from the mound, I think it really surprises them how fast the pitch gets there. And especially with the rise – when they&#x27;re used to that over-the-top release point – there is nothing else like it. The ball movement throws them off.&quot;

In the 2004 Pepsi All-Star Softball Game, Finch struck out Albert Pujols, Mike Piazza and Brian Giles. &quot;I never touched a pitch,&quot; said Giles. &quot;Her fastball was the fastest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen, from that distance. It rises and cuts at the same time.&quot;

In 2006, Finch appeared in Season One of &quot;Pros vs Joes&quot; on Spike TV, a show in which sports stars compete with ordinary people. She was the first woman to appear on the show.

Finch appeared on an episode of &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot;.

In 2008, Finch was featured as a contestant on &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot; where she selected International Breast Cancer Research Foundation as her charity. She was fired by Donald Trump in the fourth week of the season.

In 2008, Finch also served as the Grand Marshal of the nationally televised McDonald&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade in downtown Chicago.

Finch pitched for the National League in the 2010 Legends and Celebrities Softball Game, at Angel Stadium, the 2011 game at Chase Field, and the 2015 game at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, in 2017 at Marlins Park in Miami, and in 2018 at Nationals Park in Washington.

In 2011, Finch co-authored &quot;Throw Like a Girl: How to Dream Big and Believe in Yourself&quot;, with Ann Killion. The book is a collection of life lessons Finch learned growing up playing sports. On November 6, 2011, just four and a half months after giving birth to son Diesel, Finch finished the New York Marathon with a time of 4:05:26, raising $30,000 for the New York Road Runners Youth Program.

In April 2018, Finch was announced as one of the celebrities who will compete on season 26 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was partnered with professional dancer Keo Motsepe.

In 2021, Finch was featured in MLB The Show 21 in Road To The Show storyline of her being a former 2-way player.

==Personal life==
Finch married Major League Baseball pitcher Casey Daigle on January 15, 2005. Daigle proposed to Finch on the softball field at the University of Arizona, her alma mater. According to Finch, &quot;He blindfolded me and took me to the mound and said, &#x27;You have been the queen of the diamond for four years. Now I want you to be the queen of my heart.&#x27;&quot; They have two sons; Ace Shane, born on May 4, 2006 and Diesel Dean, born on June 19, 2011. Finch welcomed her daughter Paisley Faye on January 12, 2013.
Finch is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Finch is a Christian. Finch turned down large financial offers to appear in magazines like &quot;Playboy&quot; because of her Christian faith, saying she wanted to be a role model for young women. Finch has spoken about her faith, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s so important to find hope in [Jesus] and live for a higher purpose: to share about Him.&quot; Finch cited her Christian faith while on the show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; when she refused to dance to a Janelle Monáe song because she deemed it too risque.

==Retirement==
On July 20, 2010, Finch announced her retirement from softball to focus on her family. &quot;I just feel like it gets harder and harder every year with Ace getting older and time away from my husband and even family events such as birthdays and friends&#x27; weddings and things that I&#x27;ve always just missed out on because of softball,&quot; Finch said in an interview with the Associated Press. Said Finch, &quot;This whole career has been way more than I ever even imagined or dreamed. The opportunities that I&#x27;d be able to enjoy and appreciate and be a part of, it&#x27;s been incredible.&quot; In her final start with the US National Team, Finch struck out 12 and only allowed three singles including two infield ones. She continued playing with the Chicago Bandits until the National Pro Fastpitch season ended in August. Finch was the most dominant and recognizable softball pitcher of her era. &quot;She set the standard for softball in a new era of being able to be feminine and play this sport,&quot; U.S. outfielder Jessica Mendoza said. &quot;Not that you have to be feminine to play this sport, but I see hundreds of thousands of little girls now with glitter headbands, hot pink bats, makeup. ... when I was growing up, it wasn&#x27;t like that.&quot; According to Mike Candrea, her coach at Arizona and through two Olympics, &quot;Jennie has transformed this sport, touched millions of young kids in many different ways – whether it&#x27;s fashion, whether it&#x27;s the way she plays the game – but through it all she&#x27;s been very humble.&quot; A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorial commented, &quot;She leaves with a spotless personal reputation, an intent to keep promoting softball, and the knowledge that she has inspired other girls and women who play for the love of the game.&quot;

<text>Amanda Barrie (born Shirley Anne Broadbent; 14 September 1935) is an English actress. She appeared in two of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films before being cast as Alma Halliwell in ITV soap opera, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which she played on and off for 20 years. Between 2003 and 2006, she played the role of Bev Tull in the ITV prison drama, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;. She has since enjoyed a varied stage and television career.

==Early life and education==
Barrie was born Shirley Anne Broadbent in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, to Hubert Broadbent and his wife Connie (&quot;née&quot; Pyke). Barrie attended St Anne&#x27;s College, Lytham St Annes, then trained at the Arts Educational School in London and later at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

==Career==
Barrie appeared in pantomime as a child and was a dancer before working for many years as a chorus girl in the West End until her first break as an actress came along. At sixteen she danced at the Windsor Club with Danny La Rue and Barbara Windsor, changing her name before making her West End debut in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. Throughout the 1960s, Barrie worked on many stage productions including &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Private Lives&quot;, &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;. She made her screen debut in the comedy film &quot;Operation Bullshine&quot; in 1959, leading to roles in popular films including &quot;What a Whopper&quot; and &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot;. Barrie then starred in two of the Carry On films, a long-running series of British comedy films: she had a supporting part as a cab driver in &quot;Carry On Cabby&quot; (1963) and took the title role in &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; (1964). In 1965, Barrie starred alongside Billy Fury in his film &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Horse&quot;. Barrie continued to appear in many television series into the 1970s as well as presenting &quot;Hickory House&quot; with former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star Alan Rothwell between 1973 and 1977. In 1975, Barrie played Mrs. B.J. Spence in the Walt Disney film &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot;. After roles in a string of one-off television plays and series, she appeared in a guest role as a ballet mistress in the popular BBC comedy series &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in 1979. In 1982, she starred alongside Brian Murphy in &quot;L for Lester&quot;, a sitcom about a driving instructor.

Barrie is well known as Alma Sedgewick (later Baldwin), in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. She was a bit-player in the early to mid-1980s before she was offered a contract in 1988, after which her character became high-profile. She continued in the role until her departure in 2001. In the story, Alma was diagnosed with cervical cancer which later caused her death. Since leaving &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Barrie has continued to act, firstly as Margo Phillips in the long-running BBC medical soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; for nine episodes, and in the popular ITV1 prison series &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, playing inmate Bev Tull from the fifth series to the last, along with Phyl Oswyn played by Stephanie Beacham. The characters together were known as &quot;The Costa Cons&quot;.

She also became one of the celebrities who took part in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; and attempted to slap Gordon Ramsay in the face. In 2005 she appeared as the Wicked Witch of the West in a pantomime adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at an Oxford theatre. She appeared on a pantomime edition of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; dressed as the witch to raise money for charity but she was voted off in the second round. From November 2006 to January 2007, Barrie took a starring role in the pantomime adaptation of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in Canterbury. From December 2007 to January 2008, she appeared as the Fairy Godmother in the pantomime adaptation of &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Gordon Craig Theatre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. From December 2008 to January 2009, she played the Fairy Godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool. She again played the role from December 2009 to January 2010 in Rhyl. In December 2010 and January 2011 she played the role in Bournemouth. She played role again from December 2011 to January 2012 in Worthing. On Tuesday 7 August 2012 she appeared in the BBC drama &quot;Holby City&quot; as troubled, sassy, failed actress Annabella Casey. She again played the Fairy Godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Marina Theatre in Lowestoft from December 2013 to January 2014.

In June 2014, Barrie returned to the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for a 30-minute documentary entitled, &quot;Gail &amp; Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street&quot;, and was reunited with former co-stars and friends. From 2015 to 2017, Barrie had a recurring role as a fortune teller nicknamed Psychic Sue in the popular sitcom &quot;Benidorm&quot;. In 2015, she starred in the film &quot;Tea for Two&quot; alongside John Challis as a couple who run a tea room, before having a role in the 2018 drama film &quot;Together&quot; with Sylvia Syms and Peter Bowles. In January 2018, Barrie took part in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

In the summer of 2019 she appeared in series 2 of &quot;Celebrity 5 Go Barging&quot;, exploring canals around Staffordshire and Warwickshire by narrowboat.

==Personal life==
Barrie had a relationship with singer Billy Fury in the mid-1960s after they met while filming &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Horse&quot;. Fury proposed to her, but she did not accept.

In 1967, Barrie married theatre director and actor Robin Hunter. They separated in the mid-1980s, but never divorced; he died in 2004. The couple had no children. She came out as bisexual in her autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Rehearsal&quot;. On 12 September 2014, she married her long-term partner Hilary Bonner. The couple live in homes in the Blackdown Hills, Somerset, and London.

Barrie is a distant cousin of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; co-star Sally Ann Matthews, who plays Jenny Bradley.

<text>Dungarvan () is a coastal town and harbour in County Waterford, on the south-east coast of Ireland. Prior to the merger of Waterford County Council with Waterford City Council in 2014, Dungarvan was the county town and administrative centre of County Waterford. Waterford City and County Council retains administrative offices in the town. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

Dungarvan&#x27;s Irish name means &#x27;Garbhann&#x27;s fort&#x27;, referring to Saint Garbhann who founded a church there in the seventh century. The town had a population of 10,081 at the 2022 census, making it the third most populous in the county.

==Location and access==
The town lies on the N25 road (European route E30), which connects Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort. It is around south-west of Waterford and north-east of Cork.

Dungarvan is situated at the mouth of the Colligan River, which divides the town into two parishes - that of Dungarvan to the west, and that of Abbeyside to the east. These parishes are connected in three places by a causeway and single-span bridge built by the Dukes of Devonshire starting in 1801; by an old railway bridge; and by a ring-road causeway and bridge.

==History==

Evidence of ancient settlement in the Dungarvan area includes standing stone, ringfort, bullaun and reputed paleolithic burial sites in the surrounding townlands, including in Luskanargid, Kilgreany, Kilrush and Mapestown. Several sources propose that the town is of Viking origin, and evidence of Hiberno-Norse settlement in the area dates to at least the 10th century.

The Anglo-Norman Dungarvan Castle, commissioned in the late 12th or early 13th century by King John of England, stands by the harbour on the site of an earlier (possibly Hiberno-Norse) fortification. The structure of Dungarvan Castle, including a shell keep of a type atypical in Ireland, dates to c.1209.

A 13th century Augustinian abbey, now the site of Saint Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Church (built 1832), was founded by Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald (c.1145–1213). The remains of another 13th century church, on the opposite side of the harbour, are similarly found on the grounds of Saint Mary&#x27;s church (built 1831).

The town of Dungarvan was incorporated in the 15th century, was represented by two members in the Irish Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801, and returned one member to the Westminster Parliament until 1885. Unlike nearby Waterford and Duncannon, Dungarvan surrendered without a siege in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53).

The remains of a woolly mammoth were discovered in the town in 1859 by postmaster and amateur antiquarian Edward Brenan.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened Dungarvan Lifeboat Station in 1859. It was moved to Ballinacourty in 1862 and then to Crow&#x27;s Point at Helvick in 1899. The station was closed in 1969 but a new Helvick Head Lifeboat Station was established in 1997.

The 1921 Burgery ambush, an incident in the Irish War of Independence, took place near the town.

==Irish language==
As of the 2011 census, approximately 3% of the town&#x27;s population, or 242 persons were then daily Irish speakers, outside of the education system. Irish language immersion education is available at pre-school and primary school level in Dungarvan&#x27;s Gaelscoil, Scoil Garbhán. The Irish Language Officer of Waterford City and County Council is based in Dungarvan.

There are a range of activities and projects undertaken to strengthen the Irish language in the town. An Irish in Business award was established in 2009 to recognise businesses in Dungarvan and West Waterford who work to promote the Irish language.

The town is home to an office of Glór na nGael, a national body that promotes the Irish language in three areas, the language in the family, in Business and enterprise, and community development. The Dungarvan office is responsible for Glór na nGael&#x27;s work across South Leinster and most of Munster.

There is also contact between the town and the nearby Gaeltacht area of Ring, County Waterford and Old Parish which make up Gaeltacht na nDéise. Dungarvan was identified as a potential Gaeltacht Service Town under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.

==Geography==
Dungarvan is situated at the mouth of the Colligan River. Dungarvan Harbour as such is formed by The Quay (on the town side) and The Causeway. A single-span bridge was built in the late 18th century by Lord Devonshire to link Dungarvan with Abbeyside and indeed Waterford via said causeway. Outside the harbour, a sandbar, &quot;The Cunnigar&quot; (Irish &quot;An Coinigéar&quot;) defines the western limit of the wide Dungarvan Bay. The Cunnigar encloses the estuary of the River Brickey which flows out to sea at Abbeyside without actually joining the Colligan. The two estuaries are separated by &quot;The Point&quot;.
==Religion==
A friary in Abbeyside, founded by the Augustinians in the 13th century, is partially incorporated with the structure of a 20th-century Roman Catholic church. One of the most significant colleges in the town was also founded by these Augustinians, whose order remains active locally and maintains a parish church nearer to Main Street.

==Toponymy==
In everyday local usage, &quot;Dungarvan&quot; is taken to refer to the western, more commercial half of the town, where the administrative buildings and shopping areas are situated.

==Transport==
===Road===
Dungarvan is positioned on the N25 national primary road and the R672 and R675 regional roads.

===Maritime===

The town is separated from the open ocean by a shallow, eastward-facing bay. At its mouth, the bay is about two miles wide, with Dungarvan lying about four miles from the mouth. A meandering navigation channel marked by red/green buoys leads into Dungarvan from the ocean. For most vessels (except small dinghies) this channel is not navigable at low tide. Even at high tide, cruising yachts and larger vessels must be careful to remain in the buoyed channel. There is a concrete slipway in Dungarvan town, suitable for launching vessels up to eight metres in length.

===Bus===
Dungarvan is served by several bus routes. The Cork to London Eurolines coach, which provides a daily overnight cross channel service, stops at Dungarvan. Bus Éireann Expressway route number 40 runs hourly in each direction providing a link to Cork, Waterford and Rosslare Europort. Bus Éireann&#x27;s route number 362 also provides a commuter link to Waterford. Several Local Link bus services terminate in the town, including the service to Tallow via Lismore. Dublin Coach serve the town on its M9 Cork to Dublin route via Waterford, passing through every two hours.

===Rail===
Until 1967, Dungarvan had a railway station on the now dismantled Mallow to Waterford line and was served by the Rosslare to Cork boat train. The Waterford Greenway has been developed along the former line to Waterford since 2017.

==Local government==

While there is evidence of local governance in Dungarvan from at least the 15th century, the historic corporation was extinct before the Acts of Union 1800. A board of town commissioners was established in 1855. Following the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the local authority became an urban district council in 1899. It became a town council in 2002. In common with all other town councils in Ireland, it was abolished under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

The local electoral area (LEA) of Dungarvan elects six councillors to Waterford City and County Council. With the three-seat LEA of Lismore, it forms the Municipal District of Dungarvan—Lismore. Meetings of the Dungarvan—Lismore District Council are held in the Civic Offices, Dungarvan.

==Industry==
As of 2022, the consumer products company Haleon (previously part of GSK) had a manufacturing plant in Dungarvan which then employed approximately 900 people. The town is also the home of Radley Engineering, the company responsible for manufacturing the Spire of Dublin.
Dungarvan previously had a tannery, a distillery, a gasworks, and a fishing fleet. In the later 20th century, a source of trade and employment was Dungarvan Cooperative (creamery), which connected the town of Dungarvan with its agricultural hinterland.

==International relations==
===Twin towns - sister cities===
Dungarvan has been twinned with Erie, Pennsylvania in the US since March 2007.

Mercyhurst University (MU), located in Erie, has hosted a bi-annual Global Intelligence Forum in Dungarvan. Each spring, MU students and faculty also spend a term in Dungarvan as part of MU&#x27;s &#x27;study abroad&#x27; scheme. MU&#x27;s base in Dungarvan includes its European Centre for Intelligence Research, Analytics and Training.

=== Entente Florale ===
Dungarvan participated in the 2018 Entente Florale competition, organised by the European Association for Flowers and Landscape (AEFP), and received a silver medal.

==Literature==
Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin (c. 1715 – 1795), a composer of 18th century Irish bardic poetry, lived in Dungarvan for several years. While there, he experienced a religious conversion and subsequently wrote mainly Christian poetry in Munster Irish.

The British poet laureate, Sir John Betjeman (who lived in Ireland from 1941 to 1943) mentions Dungarvan in his poem, &quot;The Irish Unionist&#x27;s Farewell to Greta Hellstrom&quot;. Each stanza closes with the line, &quot;Dungarvan in the rain&quot;. Irish poet Mai O&#x27;Higgins was born on Saint Mary Street in the town centre.

Dungarvan is referred to in the collection of short stories &quot;Labyrinths&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges: In &quot;The Shape of the Sword&quot;, the protagonist notes, &quot;He was Irish, from Dungarvan. Having said this, he stopped short, as if he had revealed a secret&quot;. Dungarvan is also mentioned in the 2002 novel &quot;The Story of Lucy Gault&quot; by William Trevor.

<text>Glenties () is a town in County Donegal, Ireland. It is situated where two glens meet, north-west of the Bluestack Mountains, near the confluence of two rivers. Glenties is the largest centre of population in the parish of Iniskeel. Glenties has won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition five times in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962 and 1995. As of the 2022 census, the population was 927.

==History==
Evidence of early settlement in the area is given by the many dolmens, standing stones and earthen ringforts dating from the Bronze Age. The area became part of the baronies of Boylagh and Bannagh in 1609, which was granted to Scottish undertakers as part of the Ulster Plantation.

Glenties was a regular stopping point on the road between the established towns of Ballybofey and Killybegs, and grew from this in the 17th and 18th centuries. The town was developed as a summer home for the Marquess Conyngham in the 1820s, because of its good hunting and fishing areas. The court house and market house were built in 1843. The Bank of Ireland building was completed in 1880.

===Famine era===
A workhouse was built, in 1846 during the Great Famine, at the site of the current comprehensive school, serving the greater Inniskeel area. A 40-bed fever hospital was later added to care for the sick and dying. The landlord, the Marquis of Conyngham, decided to halve the population of the town in 1847, faced with the rising costs of the workhouse. Only those who could show title to their land as rent payers were allowed to remain. The rest were given an option of going to America on a ship provided or entering the Workhouse in Glenties. Over 40,000 people died or emigrated from County Donegal between the years 1841 and 1851.

===20th century===

The railway was completed in 1895 from Ballybofey. In 1903 a local water scheme was established, to be replaced in 1925 by the current Lough Anna supply. In 1932 electricity was first generated locally in the town. The rural electrification scheme reached the area in the 1950s.

Glenties Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks was attacked on several occasions, during the War of Independence, in 1920 and 1921. On 29 June 1921, the Irish Republican Army ambushed a group of Black and Tans who were on their way to Ardara at Kilraine, resulting in the death of a Constable Devine.

Two National Army soldiers were killed at Lacklea in 1922 by Irish Republican Army forces, during the Irish Civil War.

In January 1944, a British RAF Sunderland Mark III flying boat crashed in the Croaghs area of the Bluestack Mountains, outside of Glenties, killing seven of its 12-man crew.

Brendan Behan spent more than two months with his wife on holiday in Glenties, starting in the third week of May 1960, and staying at the Highlands Hotel. During their stay, on Sunday 24 July, the hotel was raided by Gardaí and the hotelier charged with a breach of licensing laws (the raid came more than three hours after closing time). The case was dismissed when it was explained that the event had been taking place in a private room where Behan was doing &quot;some of his literary work&quot;. Other events, documented by the &quot;Donegal Democrat&quot;, included Behan attending an Irish Countrywomen&#x27;s Association dance and he and his wife being &quot;guest artistes&quot; at a meeting of the Ardara and Glenties branch of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.

Glenties was the first townland in County Donegal to provide cable television to the local area. In 1976 &quot;Glenties Community Piped TV Co-op&quot; was established which brought cable television to Glenties and the surrounding area, enabling viewers to enjoy multi-channel television from Northern Ireland via BBC One, BBC Two, Ulster Television and from 1982 Channel Four along with the national RTE channels.

In April 2006, IRA informer Denis Donaldson was shot dead by the Real IRA at a remote cottage near Derryloaghan, 8 km from Glenties.

===Bord na Móna===
Bord na Móna bought of bog in 1937 to be drained and cut for peat. By 1943 a railway had been extended from Kilraine across the Owenea River to the bogs at Tullyard. Machine cutting commenced in 1946, utilising German-made cutting machines. The company employed 250 men in peak season and peak production was 22,000 tons in 1965. Operations ceased in the late 1990s and the railways and stock were lifted in 2006.

==Politics==
Glenties is a Municipal District, which returns six local residents to Donegal County Council. Nationally, Glenties is part of the five-seat Donegal Dáil constituency.

==Places of interest==
Glenties is situated at the meeting of two glens, and two rivers; the Owenea and Stranaglough.

===St. Connell&#x27;s church===
One of the most unusual buildings in the area is St Connell&#x27;s church, which was built in 1974 to replace the old church. The building has a flat roof sloping to the ground at a sharp angle. The original bell from the first church is still used today in the newer church. St. Connell is the patron saint of the parish. Liam McCormack won a European Award for the design of the church in 1974.

===Patrick MacGill statue===
A memorial to the &#x27;Navvy Poet&#x27;, Patrick MacGill, who was born in Glenties, is located on the bridge over the river in the centre of town.

===St. Connell&#x27;s Museum===

St. Connell&#x27;s Museum and Heritage Center houses a collection of local history artefacts, including some from the famine era. The museum is named after St. Connell Caol, who founded a monastic settlement on Inishkeel Island in the 6th century. The museum also has a display about Cardinal Patrick O&#x27;Donnell, mementoes from the filming of Dancing at Lughnasa, and a display about the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee. It also has a reading room which contains local historic records.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic games club – Naomh Conaill – fields teams at all age levels, playing football predominantly.

==In popular culture==
Glenties was a model for Brian Friel&#x27;s fictional village of Ballybeg, where several of his works were set. His play &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot;, for example, was set in Ballybeg.

==Transport==

Glenties railway station was on a branch line of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, a narrow-gauge railway system. The Glenties branch was the first part of the County Donegal Railways to be closed; the railway station (and the branch line) opened on 3 June 1895 and finally closed on 15 December 1947.

Bus transport is currently provided by Bus Éireann, operated by McGeehan&#x27;s Coaches, which provides services to Letterkenny, Ballybofey, Dungloe, Ardara, Killybegs and Donegal Town.

==Tidy Towns==
Glenties was the national winner of Ireland&#x27;s Tidy Towns competition in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, and 1995. The Radharc documentary series included a short film following Glenties&#x27; third time winning the competition.

In September 1962 a special ceremony was held to commemorate the town winning the competition. Then Minister for Transport and Energy Erskine Childers unveiled a plaque and the occasion was filmed by RTÉ. 

Glenties also received gold medals, in the Tidy Towns competition, in 2004, 2005, and 2006 and a silver medal winner in 2003. It also received a silver medal in the European Entente Florale competition held in Győr, Hungary in 2005.

<text>Naas ( ; or ) is the county town of County Kildare in Ireland. In 2022, it had a population of 26,180, making it the largest town in County Kildare (ahead of Newbridge) and the fourteenth-largest urban centre in Ireland.

==History==

The name of Naas has been recorded in three forms in Irish: , translating as &#x27;Place of Assembly of the Kings&#x27;; , translating to &#x27;the Place of Assembly&#x27;; and , translating to &#x27;Place of assembly of the Leinster Men&#x27;.

Irish mythology suggests that the name arose as the burial site of Nás (a wife of Lugh of the Tuatha De Danann). It is also said to be where Lugh held his royal court. Nás was said to have been buried on The Moat Hill (Dún Nás). The Book of Leinster contains the Dindsenchas (lore of places) of Naas with the following verses discussing where the name supposedly came from.:“(Nás)… claims of right the brow and the beauty of the spot, since she is gone, with the noise of combat, how should ye know at all the spot where she died?

“Nás took in hand a deed unwise: (truth and not folly) death o’erwhelmed her; ‘tis from her Nás was named, famous perpetually for stern law.

“Nás of the Leinstermen, bright with splendid bounty, ‘tis there the lady was buried; from her it is called with clear certitude: the lore of the ancient hides not this.”In the Middle Ages, Naas became a walled market town and was occasionally raided by the O&#x27;Byrne and O&#x27;Toole clans from the nearby area which became County Wicklow. To guard against this danger, town walls were built in around 1415. Naas features on the 1598 map by Abraham Ortelius as &quot;Nosse&quot;.

In 1409, King Henry IV of England granted Naas its first charter as a corporation, consisting of Portreeves, Burgesses and Commonality. In 1413 King Henry authorised the town to collect tolls at all entrances to the town, with the money being used for fortification of town walls and gates.

A mayor and council were selected by local merchants and landowners. Naas became known as the &quot;county town&quot; of County Kildare because of its use as a place for trading, public meetings, local administration including law courts, racecourses and the army&#x27;s Devoy Barracks (closed 1998). In the Middle Ages, before it settled permanently in Dublin, the Parliament of Ireland occasionally met in Naas, as in 1441.

Saint David&#x27;s Castle, a 13th-century Norman castle, was first built c. 1210, although the present structure is a fortified house of the 18th century.

In 1568, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted the town a new charter, creating the role of Sovereign of the town.

On 3 March 1577, Lord Rory O&#x27;More burnt Naas, to avenge his relatives who had been killed by English authorities. Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney wrote later the same month:

In 1595 Robert Ashe, Sovereign of Naas, says on oath that the charter granted the town by Elizabeth I had been accidentally burned.

In 1609 King James I of England granted the town a new charter as well as granting the Sovereign powers to appoint a Serjeant-at-mace to carry the mace before him within the limits of the borough. 

In 1628 a further charter of King James grants the corporation the right to pass byelaws provided that they are consistent with the laws of the kingdom. The Sovereign of Naas is to be a Justice of the peace.

In 1671 King Charles II of England issued an updated charter.

<text>Portarlington, historically called Cooletoodera (from ), is a town on the border of County Laois and County Offaly, Ireland. The River Barrow forms the border. Portarlington is around west of Dublin. The town was recorded in the 2022 census as having a population of 9,288.

==History==

Portarlington was founded in 1666, by Sir Henry Bennet, who had been Southern Secretary to Charles II and to whom that King, on his restoration, had made a grant of the extensive estates of Ó Díomasaigh, Viscount Clanmalier, confiscated after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. After some difficulties, the grant passed to Sir Henry Bennet of all the Ó Díomasaigh lands in the King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Counties, and on 14 April 1664 he was created Baron Arlington of Harlington in the County of Middlesex. So great was the anxiety of these new settlers to efface all ancient recollections in Ireland, that the Parliament of Orrery and Ormond enacted that the governor and council should be able to give new English names instead of the Irish names of places; and that after a time such new names should be the only ones known or allowed in the country. In accordance with this enactment the borough created in Cooletoodera (), received the name of Port-Arlington, or Arlington&#x27;s Fort.

===Huguenot settlement 1694===

Following the failure of Henry Bennet&#x27;s English colony, Port Arlington was re-established with the settlement of Huguenot refugees following the Treaty of Limerick:

Fifteen or more Huguenot families who were driven from France as religious refugees settled on the ashes of Bennet&#x27;s colony, and the settlement was unique among the Huguenot settlements in Ireland in that the French language survived, being used in church services till the 1820s and continuing to be taught in the town school.

:&quot;... and till within the last twenty years divine service was performed in the French language. In the RC divisions Portarlington is the head of a union or district, called Portarlington, Emo and Killinard ...&quot;

The Church of Ireland Bishop of Kildare came to Portarlington to consecrate the new French Church, 1694. The present-day Church of Ireland church sits on one of the town&#x27;s main thoroughfares, still named &#x27;French Church Street&#x27;, with the original French church (1694) situated just off the market square.

The relationship to the French influence with Portarlington is celebrated every July with the Festival Français de Portarlington.

===Lea Castle===
On the outskirts of the parish lies Lea Castle. The remnants of a Norman castle built in 1260 by William de Vesey. It changed hands many times during its history. For example, it was burned by Fionn Ó Díomasaigh&#x27;s men in 1284, rebuilt by de Vesey and given to the king, burned along with its town by the Scots army in 1315, burned by the O&#x27;Moores in 1346, captured by the O&#x27;Dempseys in 1422 and then lost to the Earl of Ormond in 1452, used by Silken Thomas Fitzgerald as a refuge in 1535, mortgaged to Sir Maurice Fitzgerald in 1556, and leased to Robert Bath in 1618. It was used by the confederates as a mint in the 1640s rebellion until Cromwellians blew up the fortifications by stuffing the stairways with explosives. The castle was never used as a fortification again.

Treascon Mass Rock lies just outside the town in an area known as Treascon. This mass rock (&quot;Carraig an Aifrinn&quot; in Irish) is located within a wooded area, and is a large stone used in mid-seventeenth century Ireland as a location for Catholic worship. Isolated locations were sought to hold religious ceremony, as Catholic mass was a matter of difficulty and danger at the time as a result of both Cromwell&#x27;s campaign against the Irish, and the Penal Laws of 1695, whereby discrimination and violence against Catholics was legal.

The rebellion of 1798 resulted in several local men from Lea castle being apprehended and subsequently put to death by hanging in the town&#x27;s market square. A memorial in the shape of a Celtic cross with the rebels&#x27; details was commissioned and erected in 1976. The memorial stands close to the perimeter wall of the French church in the market square.

===Rotten borough===
The Portarlington constituency returned two MPs to the Irish House of Commons until 1801, after which it was reconstituted as a UK Parliament constituency returning one MP. Two borough minute books have survived in the National Library of Ireland: Ms 90 for 1727–1777 and Ms 5095 for 1777–1841. They reveal the limitation of freemen and increasing control by the Dawson–Damer family, the Earls of Portarlington. The politics of the Protestant Ascendancy were responsible for turning Portarlington into a perfectly rotten borough. The reason was to preserve the planters&#x27; positions politically and economically. This extract shows that a corporation of 15 people was responsible for the re-election of nominees of the Dawson family to parliament, many of whom were non-resident, to represent the town of 2,800 people:
==Geography==

Portarlington is split by the River Barrow, with County Offaly on the north bank and County Laois on the south Bank; the town is mostly flat, with some slight street undulations. The town was partially built on the river&#x27;s flood plain. More recent drainage improvements has resulted in fewer floodings to areas close to the town.

Crossing the river into County Offaly, the land becomes marshy and wet with extensive peat bogs. These peat bogs are broken by some glacial hills, one such hill is called Derryvilla Hill; these hills have been used for gravel and sand production.

The southern end of the town is dominated visually by another glacial hill, know locally as &quot;Corrig&quot; (or Carrick) hill. This hill is topped by a stone structure or spire. This spire was built the latter half of the 19th century. Next to the spire is the town&#x27;s water supply reservoir. The reservoir uses the gravity afforded by the hill to supply water to the town below.

==Demographics==
County Laois suffered during the Great Famine (1845–1847), and the county&#x27;s population dropped from over 153,000 in 1841 to just over 73,000 by 1881. Famine graveyards are known locally.

The population of Portarlington itself doubled between the 2002 and 2016 census (from 4,001 to 8,368 people), reaching 9,288 in 2022. According to the 2022 census, 79.2% of inhabitants were born in Ireland, with Poland (5%), the UK (4.4%), and elsewhere in the EU (4.8%) representing other places of birth of the population. Reflecting the development of new housing in the early 21st century, the same census suggested that a majority of residents (59.81%) were living in private homes built after 2001.

==Transport==

Portarlington is a focal point of the Irish railway network, being situated on the junction for services to the west (Galway and County Mayo), the south (Cork, Limerick, Tralee) and the east (Dublin, Kildare). Portarlington halt opened on 26 June 1847.

Public transport by road includes, as of January 2017, one intercity bus service which operates direct to Dublin. It is operated by JJ Kavanagh and Sons, and serves UCD once a day up and return. There is a local-link town service operated by Slieve Bloom Coaches linking Portarlington with Portlaoise and also with Tullamore.

An additional private operator, Dublin Coach (known locally as &#x27;the green bus&#x27; due its livery), operates an hourly service to Kildare Village Outlet via Monasterevin. A weekday service by JJ Kavanagh and Sons to NUI Maynooth University and Institute of Technology, Carlow operates during the college term.

==Education ==
Coláiste Íosagáin is the main secondary school in Portarlington. The school, which is located on the Offaly side of the border, runs Transition Year, Leaving Cert Applied, and Leaving Cert Vocational programmes.

There are three primary schools, all located on the Laois side of the border.

There is also a third-level education college providing courses for post-secondary pupils as well as adult education courses.

==In media==

In 2012, RTÉ filmed in Portarlington for the TV show &quot;Dirty Old Towns&quot; over a number of weeks. The show, which was presented by Dermot Gavin and ran for 6 weeks, showed local people making improvements to the town. One of the additions was on the banks of the River Barrow, where large red-painted letters spelling &quot;L I F E&quot; were erected. The original spelling was &quot;L I V E&quot;, however when travelling from the Offaly side of the town it looked like the word &quot;E V I L&quot;. Other developments included the addition of two all-weather soccer pitches, and improvements to the People&#x27;s Park. Old shops have been redecorated and closed premises repainted. The old French School, on the banks of the river and neglected for many years, was given a &quot;facelift&quot; by the local Lions Club.

==Events and culture==
===Culture===
The People&#x27;s Museum, situated within the Catholic Club on Main Street in Portarlington is small but holds many different exhibits ranging from local memorabilia to a Bronze Age Celtic dagger.

Portarlington, its Savoy cinema (now closed) and the nearby Lea Castle appeared in the 1993 Irish film &quot;Into the West&quot;. The town is also mentioned in Christy Moore&#x27;s song &quot;Welcome to the Cabaret&quot;, featured on his 1994 album &quot;Live at the Point&quot;.

Outdoor pursuits of angling and hunting are available.

===French Festival===
A French festival, sometimes known as the &quot;Festival Français de Portarlington&quot;, has historically been held in the summer. The festival has typically run over a weekend, with live music, dance, sport, history, food and a parade. Portarlington&#x27;s French influence and &quot;Huguenot connections&quot; are celebrated with street entertainers as well as French musicians playing on the opening day. No event was held in 2018.

==Sport==
Sports clubs in the area include the Gaelic Athletic Association clubs of Portarlington GAA (based at McCann Park and founded 1893), O&#x27;Dempseys GAA (based in Killenard and founded 1951) and Gracefield GAA (based at Gracefield and founded in 1920).

Portarlington RFC is the local rugby union club. It was founded in 1974 and competes in the Leinster League.

Association football (soccer) clubs include Gracefield FC, Arlington AFC, and Portarlington Town FC, each of which competes in the Combined Counties Football League of the Leinster Football Association.

<text>HMS &quot;Duncan&quot; was a D-class destroyer leader built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935 where she remained until mid-1939. &quot;Duncan&quot; returned to the Mediterranean Fleet just after World War II began in September 1939. She was transferred to the Home Fleet in December 1939, although she was badly damaged in a collision the following month, and required repairs that lasted until July 1940. The ship joined Force H at Gibraltar in October, escorting the larger ships and various convoys until March 1941 when she was transferred to West Africa for convoy escort duties for a few months. &quot;Duncan&quot; rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar in July and escorted several convoys to Malta during the rest of the year. After a refit, she briefly returned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla before joining the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean to participate in Operation Ironclad in May 1942. The ship was recalled home to be converted into an escort destroyer in late 1942.

&quot;Duncan&quot; was assigned to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship was assigned to anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches after her refit was finished in May 1944, and &quot;Duncan&quot; remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with the Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, &quot;Duncan&quot; was in bad shape and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Duncan&quot; displaced at standard load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines, driving two shafts, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers. &quot;Duncan&quot; carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 175 officers and men.

The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mk IX guns in single mounts designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, &quot;Duncan&quot; had a single 12-pounder AA gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine guns mounted on the sides of her bridge. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. In 1936, the 12-pounder was replaced by two QF 2-pounder Mk II AA guns. Sometime after the Dunkirk evacuation, the ship&#x27;s rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the quadruple 0.5-inch machine guns were replaced by Oerlikon AA guns.

&quot;Duncan&quot; was ordered under the 1930 Naval Estimates on 2 February 1931 from Portsmouth Dockyard. She was laid down on 25 September 1931, launched on 7 July 1932 and finally commissioned into the Navy on 31 March 1933. Built as a flotilla leader, she displaced 25 long tons more than the rest of her class and carried an extra 30 personnel. These personnel formed the staff of the Captain (D) of the flotilla.

==Career==
The ship was initially assigned as the leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting at Portsmouth between 3 September and 23 October, &quot;Duncan&quot; led most of her flotilla to the China Station, arriving at Hong Kong on 3 January 1935. The next few years were spent &quot;showing the flag&quot; around the Far East, and visiting Japan, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Thailand and Malaya. The ship was under repairs between 14 December 1936 and 4 January 1937 from damage sustained when testing refuelling at sea techniques. She was in Shanghai during the Japanese invasion of 1937 and evacuated British civilians to Woosung, together with the sloop . On 28 October 1938, &quot;Duncan&quot; was struck by the Greek steamer &quot;Pipina&quot; whilst lying at anchor at Foo Chow, China. The ship was repaired and given a refit at Hong Kong between 31 October and 14 January 1939. She was lightly damaged when struck by a high-speed target at Wei Hai Wei, China, in July 1939.

===World War II===
With the outbreak of war, &quot;Duncan&quot; and her sisters , , and , were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, arriving at Alexandria on 30 September. All the ships were in poor condition, and, after repair, they conducted contraband control duties. In December &quot;Duncan&quot;, along with her sister , was assigned to escort the battleship back to the UK, and they departed Gibraltar on 6 December. During the morning of 10 December, &quot;Barham&quot; collided with &quot;Duchess&quot; off the Mull of Kintyre in heavy fog, sinking the destroyer with the loss of 124 lives. &quot;Duncan&quot; was assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet on 12 December.

She was damaged in a collision with a merchant vessel on 17 January whilst escorting Convoy ON18, causing a twenty-foot hole in her side but fortunately she did not sink and was taken under tow. After temporary repairs at Invergordon, she was towed to Grangemouth for repairs that were not completed until 22 July. She carried out post-refit trials and returned to Scapa Flow to rejoin the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla. She transferred to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based at Gibraltar in October, escorting the aircraft carrier , &quot;Barham&quot;, the heavy cruiser , and the light cruisers and from the Firth of Clyde to Gibraltar. Joining Force H, she escorted &quot;Ark Royal&quot; during Operation Coat, the carrier when she flew off Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta during Operation White and escorted Force F to Malta during Collar during November. During the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late November, &quot;Duncan&quot; was detailed to escort the convoy away from the Italians.

On 1 January 1941, she led four ships of the 13th Destroyer Flotilla as they intercepted a Vichy French convoy near Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy. A few days later she took part in Operation Excess, a military convoy taking stores to Piraeus and Alexandria. During Operation Grog in early February, the ship escorted the larger ships of Force H as they bombarded Genoa. She then escorted the battlecruiser and the carrier from Gibraltar to West Africa in early March and remained there afterwards. Based at Freetown, the ship escorted convoys through West African waters until July when she was recalled to the Mediterranean to escort the Operation Substance convoy from Gibraltar to Malta in July 1941 Reassigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla, &quot;Duncan&quot; remained at Gibraltar and was part of the close escort for the Operation Halberd convoy in late September.

In October she was assigned as part of the escort for Convoy HG 75, from Gibraltar to Liverpool, because she was scheduled for a refit in the Sheerness Dockyard. It began on 16 November and lasted until 23 January 1942, after which &quot;Duncan&quot; rejoined the 13th Destroyer Flotilla at Gibraltar. In late February and March, the ship escorted the carriers and &quot;Argus&quot; as they flew off fighters for Malta. The following month, &quot;Duncan&quot; was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Eastern Fleet to support Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Diego Suarez. After four months of operations in the Indian Ocean, the Admiralty decided to convert her to an escort destroyer, and accordingly she returned to the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope as an escort for the battleship . The ship arrived in Greenock on 16 November, but did not begin her conversion at Tilbury until 24 November.

This involved the replacement of &#x27;A&#x27; gun by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, the removal of her director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar, exchanging her two 2-pounder AA guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. &#x27;Y&#x27; gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to 98 depth charges.

In March 1943, &quot;Duncan&quot; carried out sea trials and went to Tobermory to work up. In April she joined Escort Group B-7 as the Senior Officer&#x27;s ship, with Commander Peter Gretton in command at the height of the Battle of the Atlantic. She escorted Convoy ONS 5 in early May, a major convoy battle which saw the destruction of six U-boats for the loss of thirteen ships, although &quot;Duncan&quot; was forced to withdraw for lack of fuel before the battle was over. Later that month, she escorted Convoy SC 130, in which three U-boats were destroyed for the loss of no ships. &quot;Duncan&quot; continued on North Atlantic escort duty until October 1943; on 16 October the ship rescued 15 survivors from which had been sunk earlier by a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber of the Royal Air Force. Whilst defending Convoy ON 207 on 23 October, &quot;Duncan&quot;, together with the destroyer and a Liberator of No. 224 Squadron RAF, sank . Later the same month, on 29 October, &quot;Duncan&quot; shared the sinking of with &quot;Vidette&quot; and the corvette whilst protecting Convoy ON 208.

By this time the ship was in poor shape and required an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she was assigned to the 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. &quot;Duncan&quot; conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May, transferred to Barrow on 9 June and approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. &quot;Duncan&quot; was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.

<doc id="704160" wikidata="Q2859736" url="?curid=704160" title="Tree (set theory)">
<text>In set theory, a tree is a partially ordered set (&quot;T&quot;, &lt;) such that for each &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot;, the set {&quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot; : &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;t&quot;} is well-ordered by the relation &lt;. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root (i.e. minimal element), as the typical questions investigated in this field are easily reduced to questions about single-rooted trees.

==Definition==
A tree is a partially ordered set (poset) (&quot;T&quot;, &lt;) such that for each &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot;, the set {&quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot; : &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;t&quot;} is well-ordered by the relation &lt;. In particular, each well-ordered set (&quot;T&quot;, &lt;) is a tree. For each &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot;, the order type of {&quot;s&quot; ∈ &quot;T&quot; : &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;t&quot;} is called the &quot;height&quot; of &quot;t&quot;, denoted ht(&quot;t&quot;, &quot;T&quot;). The &quot;height&quot; of &quot;T&quot; itself is the least ordinal greater than the height of each element of &quot;T&quot;. A &quot;root&quot; of a tree &quot;T&quot; is an element of height 0. Frequently trees are assumed to have only one root. Trees in set theory are often defined to grow downward making the root the greatest node.

Trees with a single root may be viewed as rooted trees in the sense of graph theory in one of two ways: either as a tree (graph theory) or as a trivially perfect graph. In the first case, the graph is the undirected Hasse diagram of the partially ordered set, and in the second case, the graph is simply the underlying (undirected) graph of the partially ordered set. However, if &quot;T&quot; is a tree of height &gt; ω, then the Hasse diagram definition does not work. For example, the partially ordered set formula_1 does not have a Hasse Diagram, as there is no predecessor to ω. Hence a height of at most ω is required in this case. 

A &quot;branch&quot; of a tree is a maximal chain in the tree (that is, any two elements of the branch are comparable, and any element of the tree &quot;not&quot; in the branch is incomparable with at least one element of the branch). The &quot;length&quot; of a branch is the ordinal that is order isomorphic to the branch. For each ordinal α, the &quot;α-th level&quot; of &quot;T&quot; is the set of all elements of &quot;T&quot; of height α. A tree is a κ-tree, for an ordinal number κ, if and only if it has height κ and every level has cardinality less than the cardinality of κ. The &quot;width&quot; of a tree is the supremum of the cardinalities of its levels.

Any single-rooted tree of height formula_2 forms a meet-semilattice, where meet (common ancestor) is given by maximal element of intersection of ancestors, which exists as the set of ancestors is non-empty and finite well-ordered, hence has a maximal element. Without a single root, the intersection of parents can be empty (two elements need not have common ancestors), for example formula_3 where the elements are not comparable; while if there are an infinite number of ancestors there need not be a maximal element – for example, formula_4 where formula_5 are not comparable.

A &quot;subtree&quot; of a tree formula_6 is a tree formula_7 where formula_8 and formula_9 is downward closed under formula_10, i.e., if formula_11 and formula_12 then formula_13.

==Set-theoretic properties==
There are some fairly simply stated yet hard problems in infinite tree theory. Examples of this are the Kurepa conjecture and the Suslin conjecture. Both of these problems are known to be independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. By Kőnig&#x27;s lemma, every ω-tree has an infinite branch. On the other hand, it is a theorem of ZFC that there are uncountable trees with no uncountable branches and no uncountable levels; such trees are known as Aronszajn trees. Given a cardinal number κ, a &quot;κ-Suslin tree&quot; is a tree of height κ which has no chains or antichains of size κ. In particular, if κ is singular then there exists a κ-Aronszajn tree and a κ-Suslin tree. In fact, for any infinite cardinal κ, every κ-Suslin tree is a κ-Aronszajn tree (the converse does not hold).

The Suslin conjecture was originally stated as a question about certain total orderings but it is equivalent to the statement: Every tree of height ω1 has an antichain of cardinality ω1 or a branch of length ω1.

If (&quot;T&quot;,&lt;) is a tree, then the reflexive closure ≤ of &lt; is a prefix order on &quot;T&quot;.
The converse does not hold: for example, the usual order ≤ on the set Z of integers is a total and hence a prefix order, but (Z,&lt;) is not a set-theoretic tree since e.g. the set {&quot;n&quot; ∈Z: &quot;n&quot; &lt; 0} has no least element.

==Examples of infinite trees==
* Let formula_14 be an ordinal number, and let formula_15 be a set. Let formula_16 be set of all functions formula_17 where formula_18. Define formula_19 if the domain of formula_20 is a proper subset of the domain of formula_21 and the two functions agree on the domain of formula_20. Then formula_6 is a set-theoretic tree. Its root is the unique function on the empty set, and its height is formula_14. The union of all functions along a branch yields a function from formula_14 to formula_15, that is, a generalized sequence of members of formula_15. If formula_14 is a limit ordinal, none of the branches has a maximal element (&quot;leaf&quot;). The picture shows an example for formula_29 and formula_30.

* Each tree data structure in computer science is a set-theoretic tree: for two nodes formula_31, define formula_32 if formula_33 is a proper descendant of formula_34. The notions of &quot;root&quot;, node &quot;height&quot;, and branch &quot;length&quot; coincide, while the notions of tree &quot;height&quot; differ by one.

* Infinite trees considered in automata theory (see e.g. &quot;tree (automata theory)&quot;) are also set-theoretic trees, with a tree height of up to formula_35.

* A graph-theoretic tree can be turned into a set-theoretic one by choosing a root node formula_36 and defining formula_32 if formula_38 and formula_34 lies on the (unique) undirected path from formula_36 to formula_33.

* Each Cantor tree, each Kurepa tree, and each Laver tree is a set-theoretic tree.

<text>Tullamore (; ) is the county town of County Offaly in Ireland. It is on the Grand Canal, in the middle of the county, and is the fourth most populous town in the Midlands Region, with 15,598 inhabitants at the 2022 census.

The town retained Gold Medal status in the National Tidy Town Awards in 2015 and also played host to the World Sheep Dog Trials in 2005, which attracted international interest in the region. The Tullamore Show is held near the town every year. The town&#x27;s most famous export is Tullamore Dew – an Irish whiskey distilled by Tullamore Distillery – that can be traced back to 1829. The original distillery was shut down in 1954. The brand was later resurrected, but at first was produced at the Midleton Distillery in Cork. However, in 2014, the brand&#x27;s new owners, William Grant &amp; Sons, invested in a new distillery near Tullamore, bringing whiskey production back to the town.

== History ==

In the Middle Ages, Tullamore was within the Gaelic territory of Firceall ruled by the O&#x27;Molloy clan. Firceall was part of the Kingdom of Meath. The Tullamore area was part of the first English plantations in Ireland during the 1550s when land was confiscated from the native Irish and colonized with English settlers. Firceall was divided into the baronies of Ballycowan, Ballyboy and Eglish, with Tullamore located in Ballycowan.

The Tullamore area, comprising some , was granted by the English to Sir John Moore in 1622. At that time the Tullamore estate included a ruined castle, ten cottages and two water mills. Sir Robert Forth, who leased the lands from Thomas Moore (son and heir of Sir John), built a mansion house c.1641 in what is now the Charleville demesne. Charles Moore, Lord Tullamore, grandson of Thomas, eventually regained possession of the estate and when he died in 1674 it went via his sister to Charles William Bury. Charles William was later (1806) created the 1st Earl of Charleville in a second creation of the title.

On 10 May 1785, the town was seriously damaged when the crash of a hot air balloon resulted in a fire that burned down as many as 130 homes, giving the town the distinction of being the location of the world&#x27;s first known aviation disaster. To this day, the town shield depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes. The event is yearly commemorated by the Phoenix festival which celebrates Tullamore&#x27;s resurrection from the ashes following the accident.

The Grand Canal linked Tullamore to Dublin in 1798. During the Napoleonic Wars, a clash between troops of the King&#x27;s German Legion and a regiment of British Light Infantry who were both stationed in the town, became known as the Battle of Tullamore. Tullamore became county town of County Offaly in 1835, replacing Daingean.

Tullamore has a long history of whiskey distilling, with two distilleries known to have operated in the town in the 1780s, though closed some years later. Subsequently, a new distillery was established by Michael Molloy, on the site of one of the old distilleries in 1829. When Molloy died, the distillery first passed to his brother Anthony, before eventually making its way into the hands of his nephew, Bernard Daly. When Daly died, his son, Captain Bernard Daly took ownership of the business. With an estate in Terenure, Captain Daly left the day-to-day running of the business to Daniel E. Williams, the distillery&#x27;s general manager, under whose careful watch the distillery grew and prospered, and launched Tullamore Dew, the whiskey which bears his initials. Williams brought electricity to Tullamore in 1893. The distillery installed the town&#x27;s first telephones and introduced motorised transport. Williams ran various commercial businesses throughout the Irish midlands – drinks businesses, tea importing, seed and grain retail, and a network of 26 general stores.

Following this period, Prohibition in the United States, an economic war with Britain in the 1930s, and World War II all harmed the industry. Tullamore was one of many Irish distilleries affected by a general decline in Irish whiskey sales worldwide. After World War II, Desmond Williams, grandson of Daniel E. Williams, used modern marketing techniques to re-establish Irish whiskey in world markets. In 1947, Desmond Williams also developed Irish Mist, an Irish liqueur made from a blend of whiskey, herbs and honey, using a recipe alleged to have disappeared in the late 17th century and to have been rediscovered in a manuscript 250 years later. Williams also capitalised on the Irish coffee concept, and promoted blended whiskeys along with Tullamore Dew.

== Culture ==

The Tullamore Phoenix Festival was an annual celebration of art, culture and heritage first held in August between 2000 and 2007. Festival events included hot air balloons, concerts, street entertainment, a parade, and fireworks.

The &quot;Queen of the Land Festival&quot; takes place in Tullamore each year on the second weekend in November. Primarily a personality contest, it seeks to find the best examples of a modern Irish woman. It is organised by Offaly Macra Na Feirme. Each year about 25 girls between the age of 17 and 35 compete to be crowned Queen of the Land. The festival provides a host of entertainment throughout the town over the weekend, primarily at night.

An annual Tullamore Show takes place on the second Sunday of August every year. It was cancelled in 2007 and 2008 due to heavy rain, though it ran again in 2009. Agriculture was originally the show&#x27;s main focus, but this has broadened to include entertainment, food, crafts, lifestyle, trade stands, food and refreshments, fashion and entertainment.

Hugh Lynch&#x27;s Pub on Kilbride Street has been operating as a public house since the early 1800s. In the early 1900s it was bought by the Williams Group, founders of the D.E. Williams Distillery, and run as a public bar and grocery, along with many other outlets in the Irish Midlands, from which they sold their growing whiskey brand &quot;Tullamore Dew&quot;. It has been in the Lynch Family since 1971.

The national Fleadh Cheoil was held in Tullamore for the very first time in August 2007. It returned in 2008 and returned for the third time from 21 to 23 August 2009.

The National Ploughing Championships, Europe&#x27;s largest Outdoor Exhibition and Agriculture Trade Show, was held in Screggan, Tullamore in 2016. The total attendance figures for the 2016 Championship came to a record-breaking 283,000. The show returned to Screggan in September 2017.

== Places of interest ==

The Tullamore Dew Visitor Centre on the banks of the Grand Canal focuses on the distilling, canal and urban history of the town. Audio visual and self-guided tours are available.

Charleville Estate is located on the edge of the town. The Gothic Charleville Castle stands in this parkland setting which contains the King Oak, one of the biggest and oldest oak trees in the country. The castle is said to be haunted and was featured on series 1 of Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. The oak woodland is botanically an important survivor of primeval stock. The park was the location of the annual Tullamore Agricultural Show. However following the cancellation of the show for two consecutive years due to heavy rainfall the event was moved to a new location with improved drainage in the Blue Ball area, south of the town.

Tullamore is used as a base for the Slieve Bloom Mountains to the south of the county.

Also south of Tullamore are the Lough Boora parklands. These boglands contain a range of flora and fauna. The wetlands also contain a number of large-scale environmental sculptures that form part of the &#x27;Sculpture in the Parklands&#x27; sculpture park. 

10  km west of Tullamore is the village of Rahan. The remains of what was once a large monastery settlement founded by St.Carthage or Mochuda in the 6th century, can be seen in the village.

Within 5 minutes drive is the Celtic cross of Durrow. In the late 6th century, Durrow Abbey was founded here by Saint Columba. The monastery is known for the Book of Durrow, an illuminated manuscript probably written here around 700.

There are four metal sculptures located on the N52 Tullamore bypass funded under the percentage for arts scheme where 1% of the budget is allocated to roadside art. Sculptor Maurice Harron created the figures presenting symbols of learning and sanctity. The figures are located on esker ridges that the new roadway cuts through.

There are also a number of churches in the town, including Tullamore Catholic Church, Tullamore Presbyterian Church and St. Catherine&#x27;s Church of Ireland church.

Tullamore Town Hall, which dates from 1786, used to be a private house known as Acres Hall.

== Economy ==

As the county town of Offaly, many government services are located here such as the headquarters of Offaly County Council, the Midlands Regional Hospital and HSE services. Government departments located in the town include the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education.

Tullamore has traditionally been an important industrial, retail and services centre for County Offaly. When the Grand Canal opened in the late 18th century, it offered increased connectivity to the town and offered an increased market for goods produced in the area. Tullamore Dew, a brand of Irish Whiskey was first distilled in the town in 1829. Tullamore was connected to the national railway network in 1854 by the Great Southern and Western Railway company, now Iarnród Éireann. Tullamore is also located near the boglands of the Bog of Allen. This provided employment through the work of Bord na Mona. Agriculture is also important to the local economy.

A number of industrial estates are located in the town. For example, in Srah Industrial Estate, employers include multinationals like Sennheiser, GeneMedix, Covidien, Isotron and Zannini.

=== Retail ===
The Bridge Centre, one of the main shopping areas in the town centre, opened on 12 September 1995. It has outlets of Dunnes Stores, Vero Moda, and Holland and Barrett. The Tullamore Retail Park on the Portarlington Road also has a mix of shops including Tesco, Heatons, Petmania, Harry Corry and Woodie&#x27;s DIY. In September 2016, Boots opened in the town centre.

== Media ==

From 1975 until 24 March 2008, Tullamore was the home of RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s principal medium-wave transmitter, broadcasting the AM version of Radio 1 on 567 kHz, at a power of 500 kW. Before this, the main transmission centre had been sited near Athlone. In addition to being the headquarters of Midlands 103, Tullamore is home to a number of local newspapers including &quot;The Tullamore&quot; Tribune and &quot;The Offaly Independent&quot;.

Tullamore features in several books by the author Lyn Andrews.

== Demographics ==

The population of Tullamore (and its environs) rose from 10,029 in 1996 to 15,598 in 2022, an increase of over 55%.

== Transport and access ==

Tullamore railway station, first opened on 2 October 1854, is served by trains on the Dublin-Galway and Dublin-Westport/Ballina inter-city routes.

In association with the County Westmeath urban centres, Athlone and Mullingar, Tullamore forms part of what is known as the Midlands Gateway.

Tullamore lies on the N52 national secondary road. This connects to Birr in the southwest of the county and continues towards Mullingar which is located to the northeast. At Kilbeggan (about 12 km north of Tullamore) the N52 forms an interchange with the M6 motorway which connects Dublin and Galway. The N80 national secondary road connects Tullamore with Killeigh, Mountmellick and Portlaoise, travelling in a southwards direction. A number of regional roads run through the town such as the R420 connecting Tullamore to Moate, Clara and Portarlington, and the R421 which connects to Kinnitty.

=== N52 Tullamore Bypass ===
In 2009, Tullamore was bypassed by re-routing the N52 away from the town centre. The bypass is to the east of the town, and is a single carriageway which leaves the previous N52 approximately southwest of Tullamore, intersecting with the N80 road, crossing over the Grand Canal, before rejoining the original N52 north of the town. A spur was constructed from the northern section of the route to the Tullamore Western Relief Road R443 creating in an almost-full orbital route around Tullamore. The N80 now terminates at its junction with the N52. The scheme began construction in April 2008, and was officially opened in late 2009 by then Taoiseach Brian Cowen.

== Sport ==
Tullamore has a number of sporting organisations, including Gaelic games, association football, rugby union and athletics clubs.

Gaelic games are represented by Tullamore GAA, Ballinamere GAA and Durrow GAA. Tullamore GAA won four senior football championships and one senior hurling championship in the early 21st century. Between football and hurling championships, Tullamore is one of the most successful clubs in the history of Offaly GAA. Ballinamere won the intermediate hurling championship in 2013, and therefore play senior hurling along with Tullamore. Durrow partakes in the senior &#x27;B&#x27; football championship. O&#x27;Connor Park is the Offaly GAA home stadium for both the Offaly Gaelic football and hurling teams. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 following an upgrade in 2006. The ground consists of a covered stand on one side of the pitch, with terracing on the other three. A stand was built in 1991 but replaced by the current structure in 2006. It seats 7,000 people and also includes a press box and a special section for wheelchair users.

Association football (soccer) is represented by Tullamore Town F.C. This club was founded in 1941 and have teams in the Leinster Senior League, Combined Counties League (2nd team Women&#x27;s and Youths) and the Midland Schoolboys League.

Tullamore Rugby Club was founded in 1937 and is based in Spollenstown. The Tullamore 1sts team was successful in 2012 as Ulster Bank All Ireland Jnr Cup Champions.

Tullamore Harriers caters for athletics in the town, and was founded in 1953.

Other leisure facilities include the Aura Leisure Centre Tullamore, located on Hophill Road, which has a full gym suite and a 25-metre swimming pool. Tullamore Golf Club has been situated at Brookfield since 1926 and has an 18-hole championship parkland golf course. It was rated among the top 25 parkland courses in Ireland in &quot;Backspin&quot;&#x27;s 2014 Irish Golf Course Rankings.

== Education ==

Tullamore has several primary schools. There are several Catholic schools, a Church of Ireland school, a Gaelscoil and an Educate Together school. There are three secondary schools in the town; Tullamore College, a coeducational, multidenominational vocational school, the Sacred Heart School, a Catholic all-girls school and Coláiste Choilm, a Catholic all-boys school.

<doc id="704166" wikidata="Q5235149" url="?curid=704166" title="David Horowitz (consumer advocate)">
<text>David Charles Horowitz (June 30, 1937February 14, 2019) was an American consumer reporter and journalist for KNBC in Los Angeles, whose Emmy-winning TV program &quot;Fight Back!&quot; would warn viewers about defective products, test advertised claims to see if they were true, and confront corporations about customer complaints. He was on the boards of directors of the National Broadcast Editorial Conference, City of Hope, and the American Cancer Society, and he served on the advisory boards of the FCC and the Los Angeles District Attorney.

Horowitz has been described as a consumer advocate; he personally shunned the description, noting that he always tried to maintain an objective point of view toward both the consumer and the businesses he profiled.

==Early life==
David Horowitz attended Bradley University, where he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi, and graduated with high honors in 1959. Horowitz earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from Northwestern University in 1961, then worked at newspapers and TV stations in the Midwest, including KRNT-TV (now KCCI) in Des Moines, Iowa. He was a writer for The Huntley–Brinkley Report.

== Television career ==
Horowitz opened the first news bureau for NBC News during the Vietnam War.

In early 1973, Horowitz was offered a chance to develop a consumer-awareness news segment for KNBC, NBC&#x27;s flagship Los Angeles station. He nearly turned it down because they had offered it to six other people before him. Nevertheless, the segment on &quot;KNBC Newservice&quot; was successful, and Horowitz gained a reputation through the 1970s as a consumer reporter and advocate. He began the weekly consumer advocate program &quot;Fight Back! with David Horowitz&quot; in 1976, and he made appearances on NBC programs including regular appearances on the &quot;Today&quot; program and on &quot;America Alive!&quot; in 1978.

Horowitz made a guest appearance on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; in 1989. He also appeared as himself on an episode of &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;The Munsters Today&quot;, and &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. Horowitz was also a regular guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (which also occasionally parodied him as &quot;David Howitzer&quot;).

Horowitz left KNBC in August 1992 after the station declined to renew his contract and joined KCBS-TV the following year, where he resumed his &quot;Fight Back!&quot; segments for &quot;Channel 2 Action News.&quot;

==Hostage situation==
On August 19, 1987, during the 4 p.m. edition of KNBC&#x27;s &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, a gun-wielding man named Gary Stollman got into NBC&#x27;s Burbank Studios as a guest of an employee and took Horowitz hostage live on the air. With the gun pressed on his side, Horowitz calmly read the gunman&#x27;s statements on camera but unbeknownst to the gunman, the news feed had been taken off the air. The unidentified man revealed at the end of his statement that the gun was an empty BB gun and set the gun down on the news desk, at which point anchorman John Beard quickly confiscated it. The incident led Horowitz to start a campaign to ban realistic toy guns.

==Controversies==
In 1998, Horowitz joined a political campaign to urge voters to defeat a California ballot initiative calling for a 20% cut in electricity rates for private utility customers and ending surcharges on ratepayers to pay for nuclear power plants. Horowitz later admitted he was paid $106,000 by the campaign.

==Death==
Horowitz died on February 14, 2019, from complications due to dementia. He left behind a wife, two daughters, and two grandchildren. David Horowitz&#x27;s daughter Amanda Horowitz owns and has continued work under the &quot;Fight Back!&quot; brand.

<text>The Clark Fork, or the Clark Fork of the Columbia River, is a river in the U.S. states of Montana and Idaho, approximately long. It is named after William Clark of the 1806 Lewis and Clark Expedition. The largest river by volume in Montana, it drains an extensive region of the Rocky Mountains in western Montana and northern Idaho in the watershed of the Columbia River. The river flows northwest through a long valley at the base of the Cabinet Mountains and empties into Lake Pend Oreille in the Idaho Panhandle. The Pend Oreille River in Idaho, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada which drains the lake to the Columbia in Washington, is sometimes included as part of the Clark Fork, giving it a total length of , with a drainage area of . In its upper in Montana near Butte, it is known as Silver Bow Creek. Interstate 90 follows much of the upper course of the river from Butte to Saint Regis. The highest point within the river&#x27;s watershed is Mount Evans at in Deer Lodge County, Montana along the Continental Divide.

The Clark Fork is a Class I river for recreational purposes in Montana from Warm Springs Creek to the Idaho border.

==Description==

It rises as Silver Bow Creek in southwestern Montana, less than from the Continental Divide near downtown Butte, from the confluence of Basin and Blacktail creeks. It flows northwest and north through a valley in the mountains, passing east of Anaconda, where it changes its name to the Clark Fork at the confluence with Warm Springs Creek, then northwest to Deer Lodge. Near Deer Lodge it receives the Little Blackfoot River. From Deer Lodge it flows generally northwest across western Montana, passing south of the Garnet Range toward Missoula. Five miles east of Missoula, the river receives the Blackfoot River.

Northwest of Missoula, the river continues through a long valley along the northeast flank of the Bitterroot Range, through the Lolo National Forest. It receives the Bitterroot River from the south-southwest approximately west of downtown Missoula. Along the Cabinet Mountains, the river receives the Flathead River from the east near Paradise. It receives the Thompson River from the north near Thompson Falls in southern Sanders County.

There are three dams on the lower Clark Fork River. At Thompson Falls, about northwest of Missoula, the Thompson Falls Dam, actually a series of four dams that bridge between islands in the river, was built atop the falls in 1915. Next, at Noxon, Montana, along the Cabinet Mountains and the northern end of the Bitterroots near the Idaho border, the river is impounded by the Noxon Rapids Dam, completed in 1959 and forming a reservoir. It crosses into eastern Bonner County in north Idaho between the towns of Heron, Montana and the town of Cabinet, Idaho. In Idaho, just before the town of Cabinet, the Clark Fork River is dammed again at the Cabinet Gorge Dam. The Cabinet Gorge Dam was completed in the early 1950s, and its reservoir extends eastwards into Montana. 

After passing the Cabinet Gorge Dam, the river enters the northeastern end of Lake Pend Oreille, approximately west of the Idaho–Montana border, near the town of Clark Fork, Idaho.

==History==

During the last ice age, from approximately 20,000 years ago, the Clark Fork Valley lay along the southern edge of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet covering western North America. The encroachment of the ice sheet formed an ice dam on the river, creating Glacial Lake Missoula, which stretched through the Clark Fork Valley across central Montana. The periodic rupturing and rebuilding of the ice dam released the Missoula Floods, a series of catastrophic floods down the Clark Fork and Pend Oreille into the Columbia, which sculpted many of the geographic features of eastern Washington and the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

In the 19th century, the Clark Fork Valley was inhabited by the Flathead tribe of Native Americans. It was explored by Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during the 1806 return trip from the Pacific. The river is named for William Clark. A middle segment of the river in Montana was formerly known as the Missoula River. The river was also referred to as the Deer Lodge River by Granville Stuart.

In 1809, David Thompson of the North West Company explored the region and founded several fur trading posts, including Kullyspell House at the mouth of the Clark Fork, and Saleesh House on the river near the present-day site of Thompson Falls, Montana. Thompson used the name Saleesh River for the entire Flathead-Clark Fork-Pend Oreille river system. For most of the first half of the 19th century the Clark Fork river and surrounding region was controlled by the British-Canadian North West Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company.

In the mid-19th century, the Clark Fork River wound through the valley where cattle had replaced bison. This was when Conrad Kohrs purchased a ranch from Johnny Grant that is now called the Grant-Kohrs Ranch, a National Historic Site and Federal Park. For a history of the river and the people, see Grant-Kohrs family and history of Clark Fork River region.

The Clark Fork and the Blackfoot River experienced a record flood in 1908.

Since the late 19th century many areas in the watershed of the river have been extensively mined for minerals, resulting in an ongoing stream pollution problem. Most pollution has come from the copper mines in Butte and the smelter in Anaconda. Many of the most polluted areas have been designated as Superfund sites. Nevertheless, the river and its tributaries are among the most popular destinations for fly fishing in the United States.

Today, the Clark Fork watershed encompasses the largest Superfund site in America. As a mega-site, it includes three major sites: Butte, Anaconda, and Milltown Dam/Clark Fork River&#x27;s Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site. Each of these major sites is split up into numerous sub-sites known as Operable Units.

Milltown Dam was removed in 2008 at the junction of the Clark Fork and Blackfoot Rivers. Stimson Dam (an old log crib dam) was removed in 2007 just upstream of the Milltown Dam on the Blackfoot River. Stimson Dam was normally under water due to the Milltown Dam. The area that used to be under Milltown Lake has recently become a State Park. Continued remediation and/or restoration of these sites is ongoing.

<text>Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše covers the role of the Croatian Catholic Church in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi puppet state created on the territory of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia in 1941.

==Background==

For centuries, Croatia had been a part of the Habsburg Empire. A variety of ethnic groups have long existed in the region, and there has been a strong correlation between ethnic identity and religious affiliation, with Croats being mainly Catholic, and more Western-oriented, while the Serbs are Eastern Orthodox.

Following the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire at the close of World War I, the desire of Croatian nationalists for independence was not realised, and the region found itself first in the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and then in the equally Serb-dominated dictatorship of Yugoslavia established by King Alexander in 1929. Internal borders were redrawn dividing historical Croatia into several provinces. Political repression bred extremism, and the &quot;Ustaša&quot; (&quot;Insurgence&quot;) was formed in 1929 by Ante Pavelić, with the support of Fascist Italy. In 1934, King Alexander was assassinated by a Bulgarian gunman, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, a radical group seeking independence, allied with the Croatian Ustaše group led by Pavelić. The new Regent Prince, Paul Karadjordjević, was convinced by the success of Vladko Maček&#x27;s more moderate Croatian Peasant&#x27;s Party at 1938 elections to grant further autonomy to Croatia.

On 6 April 1941, Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. In their military campaign, the Axis forces exploited ethnic divisions in Yugoslavia, and presented themselves as liberators of the Croats. The then-victorious Axis powers set up a puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH), which included Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the parts of Dalmatia not annexed to Italy. Deputy prime minister Maček refused to collaborate in a puppet government, and Pavelić&#x27;s Ustaše was installed in power. In Pavelić, Hitler found an ally.

Initially there was enthusiasm for Croatian independence, but the state was in fact under occupation by the German and Italian armies, while the Ustaša commenced a ruthless persecution of Serbs, Jews, Roma and dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb welcomed Croat independence in 1941, but subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and involved himself in personally saving Jews. The Pavelić government intended to rid Croatia of its Eastern Orthodox Serb minority in three ways: forcible conversion (1/3), deportation (1/3) and murder (1/3). From around 217,00 to 500,000 people (although the exact number is impossible to ascertain and is disputed by different sides) were killed by the Ustaša, both in massacres and at concentration camps, most infamously the one at Jasenovac. Most of the victims were Serbs, but Jews, Roma and dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims were also targeted.

==Independent State of Croatia==
===Creation and recognition===
Ante Pavelić, the head of the Ustaša, was anti-Serb and viewed Catholicism as an integral part of Croat culture. Historian Michael Phayer wrote that for the Ustaša, &quot;relations with the Vatican were as important as relations with Germany&quot; as Vatican recognition was the key to widespread Croat support. The creation of the Independent State of Croatia was welcomed by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and by many Catholic priests. Archbishop Stepinac supported Croatia&#x27;s independence from the Serb-dominated Yugoslav state and arranged an audience with Pius XII for Pavelić.

Author Peter Hebblethwaite wrote that Pavelić was anxious to get diplomatic relations and a Vatican blessing for the new &quot;Catholic state&quot; but that &quot;Neither was forthcoming&quot;. Giovanni Montini (the future Pope Paul VI) advised Pavelić that the Holy See could not recognize frontiers changed by force. The Yugoslav royal legation remained at the Vatican. When the King of Italy averred that the Duke of Spoleto was to be &quot;King of Croatia&quot;, Montini advised that the Pope could not hold a private audience with the Duke once any such coronation occurred. 

===Pavelić audience===
Pavelić visited Rome on 18 May 1941 to sign a treaty with Mussolini granting Italy control over several Croatian cities and districts on the Dalmatian coast. While in Rome, Pius subsequently relented, allowing a half-hour private audience with Pavelić in May 1941. In the 1831 papal bull &quot;Sollicitudo Ecclesiarum&quot;, Pope Gregory XVI had drawn a clear distinction between &quot;de facto&quot; recognition and &quot;de jure&quot;, saying that the church would negotiate with &quot;de facto&quot; governments, but that was not an endorsement of either their legitimacy or policies. Soon afterwards, Abbot Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone was appointed apostolic legate to Zagreb. The minutes of a meeting, taken by Vatican Under Secretary of State Montini (later Pope Paul VI), noted that no recognition of the new state could come before a peace treaty and that &quot;the Holy See must be impartial; it must think of all; there are Catholics on all sides to whom the [Holy See] must be respectful.&quot; Phayer wrote that just after becoming dictator of Croatia and &quot;after receiving a papal blessing in 1941, Ante Pavelić and his Ustaša lieutenants unleashed an unspeakable genocide in their new country.&quot;

===Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone===
The Vatican refused formal recognition but neither did it cut diplomatic relations with the NDH, preferring to work diplomatically to end Ustaša terror. In 1941, Pius XII did not send a &quot;nuncio&quot;, or diplomatic representative, but an apostolic visitor, Benedictine abbot Dom Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone, as representative to the Croatian Catholic Church, rather than the government. Phayer wrote that this suited Pavelić well enough.

Marcone reported to Rome on the deteriorating conditions for Croatian Jews, made representations on behalf of the Jews to Croatian officials, and transported Jewish children to safety in neutral Turkey.

The Vatican used Marcone, together with Archbishop Stepinac of Zagreb, to pressure the Pavelić government to cease its facilitation of race murders. When deportation of Croatian Jews began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to Andrija Artuković. In his study of rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust, Martin Gilbert wrote: &quot;In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, as a result of intervention by [Marcone] on behalf of Jewish partners in mixed marriages, a thousand Croat Jews survived the war.&quot; 

The Pope met with Pavelić again in 1943. Pius was criticized for his reception of Pavelić: an unattributed British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius XII as &quot;the greatest moral coward of our age.&quot; For their part, wrote Phayer, the Vatican hoped the Ustaša would defeat communism in Croatia and that many of the 200,000 who had left the Catholic Church for the Serbian Orthodox Church since World War I would return to the fold.

===Clergy involved in Ustaše violence===
Mark Biondich notes that &quot;[T]he younger generation of radical Catholics, particularly those of the crusader organisation, supported the Ustaša with considerable enthusiasm, while the older generation of Croat Populists [HSS] was more reserved and in some cases overtly hostile.&quot; This generational gap between conservative and radical Catholic priests was further reflected by region (urban vs rural), the geographical location of churches and bishoprics, and an individual priest&#x27;s relative place within the Church hierarchy. More senior clerics generally disassociated themselves from the NDH. They were also divided by religious orders. The Franciscans, who had resisted for over fifty years Vatican efforts to turn over parishes to secular clergy, were far more prominently associated with the Ustaša than were the Salesians.

Mass murder occurred through the summer and autumn of 1941. The first Croatian concentration camp was opened at the end of April 1941, and in June a law was passed to establish a network across the country, in order to exterminate ethnic and religious minorities. According to writer Richard Evans, atrocities at the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp were &quot;egged on by some Franciscan friars&quot;. Phayer wrote that it is well known that many Catholic clerics participated directly or indirectly in Ustaša campaigns of violence, as is attested in the work of Corrado Zoli (Italian) and Evelyn Waugh (British), both Roman Catholics themselves; Waugh by conversion.

The Croatian Franciscans were heavily involved in the Ustaše regime. A particularly notorious example was the Franciscan friar Tomislav Filipović, also known as Miroslav Filipović-Majstorović, known as &quot;Fra Sotona&quot; (&quot;Friar Satan&quot;), &quot;the devil of Jasenovac&quot;, for running the Jasenovac concentration camp, where most estimates put the number of people killed at approximately 100,000. According to Evans, Filipović led murder squads at Jasenovac. According to the Jasenovac Memorial Site, &quot;Because of his participation in the mass murders in February 1942 the church authorities excommunicated him from the Franciscan order, which was confirmed by the Holy See in July 1942.&quot; He was also required to relinquish the right to his religious name, Tomislav. When he was hanged for war crimes, however, he wore his clerical garb.

Ivan Šarić, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vrhbosna in Sarajevo, supported the Ustaša, in particular the forcible conversion of Orthodox Serbs to Roman Catholicism. His diocesan newspaper wrote: &quot;[T]here is a limit to love. The movement of liberation of the world from the Jews is a movement for the renewal of human dignity. Omniscient and omnipotent God stands behind this movement.&quot; Šarić appropriated Jewish property for his own use, but was never legally charged. Some priests served in the personal bodyguard of Pavelić, including Ivan Guberina, a leader of the Croatian Catholic movement, a form of Catholic Action. Another priest, Božidar Bralo, served as chief of the security police in Sarajevo, who initiated many anti-Semitic actions.

To consolidate Ustaša party power, much of the party work in Bosnia and Herzegovina was put in the hands of Catholic priests by Jure Francetić, an Ustaše Commissioner of this province. One priest, Mate Mugos, wrote that clergy should put down the prayer book and take up the revolver. Another cleric, Dionysius Juričev, wrote in the &quot;Novi list&quot; that to kill children at least seven years of age was not a sin. Phayer argues that &quot;establishing the fact of genocide in Croatia prior to the Holocaust carries great historical weight for our study because Catholics were the perpetrators and not, as in Poland, the victims.&quot;

Sister Gaudencija Šplajt (born Fanika Šplajt) was a Catholic nun sentenced by the Partisan military court in Zagreb on 29 June 1945 to execution by shooting for aiding, harboring, and hiding a German bandit, the notorious Ustaša Tolj, and other Ustaše after the liberation of Zagreb.

===Clergy opposed to Ustaše violence===
Pavelić told Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop that while the lower clergy supported the Ustaše, the bishops, and particularly Archbishop Stepinac, were opposed to the movement because of &quot;Vatican international policy&quot;. Along with Archbishop Stepinac, bishops Mišić and Rožman objected to the Ustaša violence. Hebblethwaite wrote that to oppose the violence of the new Ustaše state, the &quot;Vatican&#x27;s policy was to strengthen the hand of [Archbishop Stepinac] in his rejection of forcible conversions and brutalities.&quot;

Phayer wrote that Stepinac came to be considered as &quot;jeudenfreundlich&quot; (&quot;Jew friendly&quot;) by the Nazi-linked Ustaše authorities. He suspended a number of priest collaborators in his diocese. Thirty-one priests were arrested following Stepinac&#x27;s July and October 1943 explicit condemnations of race murders being read from pulpits across Croatia. Historian Martin Gilbert wrote that Stepinac, &quot;who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews.&quot; Aloysius Mišić, Bishop of Mostar, was a prominent resister. Gregorij Rožman, the bishop of Ljubljana in Slovenia, allowed some Jews who had converted to Catholicism and fled from Croatia into his diocese to remain there, with assistance from the Jesuit Pietro Tacchi Venturi in obtaining the permission of the Italian civil authorities.

In Italian-occupied Croatia, Nazi envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces were not willing to hand over Jews and had &quot;apparently been influenced&quot; by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism. The intervention of Giuseppe Marcone, Pius XII&#x27;s Apostolic Visitor to Zagreb, saved a thousand Croatian Jews married to non-Jews. The Apostolic delegate to Turkey, Angelo Roncalli, saved a number of Croatian Jews by assisting their migration to Palestine. Roncalli succeeded Pius XII as Pope, and always said that he had been acting on the orders of Pius XII in his actions to rescue Jews.

Yad Vashem has recognised many people from the area of the NDH as Righteous among the Nations for rescuing Jews from the Holocaust, as of 2019 117 from Croatia, 47 from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 15 from Slovenia. Those include Catholic nuns, Jožica Jurin (Sister Cecilija), Marija Pirović (Sister Karitas), and Sister Amadeja Pavlović, and a priest, Father Dragutin Jesih, who was murdered.

Archbishop Stepinac denounced atrocities against the Serbs. Phayer wrote that in July 1941, Stepinac wrote to Pavelić objecting to the condition of deportation of Jews and Serbs and then, realizing that conversion could save Serbs, he instructed clergy to baptise people upon demand without the normal waiting time for instruction. As Pavelić&#x27;s government cracked down on Serbs, along with Jews, Roma, Communists and anti-fascists, the Catholic clergy took steps to encourage Orthodox Serbs to convert to Roman Catholicism.

===Church and forced conversions===
According to Matthew Feldman, &quot;[T]he NDH, not the Catholic orders, oversaw forced conversions; it was Ustaša ideology behind the influx of racial – not religious – anti-Semitism in 1941&quot;. &quot;[T]his was a secular, not a religious, regime, one that appealed to (and ultimately perverted) centuries-long Croatian traditions of Roman Catholicism to initially legitimate its rule.&quot; By 14 July 1941 – &quot;anticipating its selective conversion policy and eventual goal of genocide&quot; – the Croatian Ministry of Justice instructed the Croatian episcopate that &quot;priests or schoolmasters or, in a word, any of the intelligentsia, including rich Orthodox tradesmen and artisans&quot;, should not be admitted. Those precluded from the &quot;coming program of enforced conversion&quot; were deported and killed, although many who converted or tried to do so met the same fate, anyway. Croats appropriated many Serbian Orthodox churches as &quot;vacated or requisitioned&quot;. The Catholic episcopate and HKP, the Croatian branch of Catholic Action, a lay organization, were involved in the coordination and administration of these policies.

Paris notes that more than 50% of the Catholic clergy were active supporters of the Ustaše regime. Ustaše crimes committed against the Serbian population were generally done so under the pretext of expanding Catholicism in the region. For example, the majority of Serbians interned in NDH concentration camps were interned due to the fact that they refused to convert to Catholicism. In many municipalities around the NDH, warning posters declared that any Serb who did not convert to Catholicism would be deported to a concentration camp.

==Catholic hierarchy==
===Archbishop Stepinac===

Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb was, at the time of his appointment in 1934 at the age of 39, the youngest Catholic bishop in the world. He initially received very little guidance from the Vatican and was given great leeway in how to deal with the rise of the Ustaše. His control over the lower bishops and clergy was not uniform. Historian of the Holocaust Martin Gilbert wrote that, &quot;Stepinac, who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews in an old age home.&quot;

Stepinac shared the hope for a Catholic Croatia and viewed the Yugoslav state as &quot;the jail of the Croatian nation&quot;. The Vatican was not as enthusiastic as Stepinac and did not formally recognize the Ustaša, instead sending Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone as an apostolic visitor. According to Phayer, Stepinac, who arranged the meeting between Pius XII and Pavelić, was satisfied with this step, viewing it as &quot;de facto&quot; recognition and Marcone as a nuncio in all but name. Stepinac began attempting to publicly distance himself from the Ustaša in May 1941. As the Ustaše murders &quot;increased exponentially&quot; in the summer and fall of 1941, Stepinac fell under &quot;heavy criticism&quot; for the church&#x27;s collaboration, but he was not yet prepared to break completely with the Ustaše. Phayer wrote that Stepinac gave the Ustaše the &quot;benefit of the doubt ... [and] decided on a limited response.&quot;

Stepinac called a synod of Croatian bishops in November 1941. The synod appealed to Pavelić to treat Jews &quot;as humanely as possible, considering that there were German troops in the country.&quot; The Vatican replied with praise to Marcone for what the synod had done for &quot;citizens of Jewish origin&quot;, although Israeli historian Menachem Shelah wrote that the synod concerned itself only with converted Jews. Pius XII personally praised the synod for &quot;courage and decisiveness&quot;. Shelach has written that:A bishops&#x27; conference that met in Zagreb in November 1941 was not ... prepared to denounce the forced conversion of Serbs that had taken place in the summer of 1941, let alone condemn the persecution and murder of Serbs and Jews. It was not until the middle of 1943 that Stepinac, the Archbishop of Zagreb, publicly came out against the murder of Croatian Jews (most of whom had been killed by that time), the Serbs, and other nationalities. In the early stage, the Croatian massacres were explained as &quot;teething troubles of a new regime&quot; in Rome by Msgr Domenico Tardini of the Vatican state secretariat.— Excerpt from Encyclopedia of the Holocaust.

According to scholar Ronald J. Rychlak:Stepinac, after having received direction from Rome, condemned the brutal actions of the government. A speech he gave on 24 October 1942 stated in part: &quot;All men and all races are children of God; all without distinction. Those who are Gypsies, black, European, or Aryan all have the same rights. ... For this reason, the Catholic Church had always condemned, and continues to condemn, all injustice and all violence committed in the name of theories of class, race, or nationality. It is not permissible to persecute Gypsies or Jews because they are thought to be an inferior race&quot;.

Rychlak writes that the &quot;Associated Press reported that &quot;by 1942 Stepinac had become a harsh critic&quot; of the Nazi puppet regime, condemning its &quot;genocidal policies, which killed tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and Croats.&quot; He thereby earned the enmity of the Croatian dictator, Ante Pavelić. ... [When] Pavelić traveled to Rome, he was greatly angered because he was denied the diplomatic audience he had wanted&quot;, although he enjoyed at least two &quot;devotional&quot; audiences with the pontiff, under whom the Vatican granted Pavelić &quot;de facto recognition&quot; as a &quot;bastion against communism&quot;. Phayer wrote that Stepinac came to be known as &quot;jeudenfreundlich&quot; (&quot;Jew friendly&quot;) to the Nazis and the Ustaše regime. He suspended a number of priest collaborators in his diocese.

Stepinac declared publicly in mid-1942 that it was &quot;forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race&quot;. When Himmler visited Zagreb a year later, indicating the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote Pavelić that if this occurred, he would protest for &quot;the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, whatever it may be, when it has to protect basic human values&quot;. When the deportations began, Stepinac and papal envoy Giuseppe Marcone protested to Andrija Artuković. According to Phayer, the Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup. Although Stepinac reportedly personally saved many potential victims, his protests had little effect on Pavelić.

===Role of the Vatican===
Cornwell considers Catholic involvement important because of &quot;the Vatican&#x27;s knowledge of the atrocities, Pacelli&#x27;s failure to use his good offices to intervene, and the complicity it represented in the Final Solution being planned in northern Europe.&quot; Pius XII was a long-standing supporter of Croat nationalism; he hosted a national pilgrimage to Rome in November 1939 for the cause of the canonization of Nikola Tavelić, and largely &quot;confirmed the Ustashe perception of history&quot;. In a meeting with Stepinac, Pius XII reiterated the words of Pope Leo X, that the Croats were &quot;the outpost of Christianity&quot;, which implied that Orthodox Serbs were not true Christians. Pius XII foretold to Stepinac, &quot;[T]he hope of a better future seems to be smiling on you, a future in which the relations between Church and State in your country will be regulated in harmonious action to the advantage of both.&quot;

Undersecretary of State Montini (later elected Pope Paul VI) was responsible for &quot;day-to-day matters concerning Croatia and Poland&quot;. He reported to Pius XII on a daily basis, and heard of the Ustaša atrocities in 1941. In March 1942, Montini asked the Ustaša representative to the Vatican, &quot;Is it possible that these atrocities have taken place?&quot;, and responded that he would view such accusations with &quot;considerable reserve&quot; once the representative called them &quot;lies and propaganda&quot;. Montini&#x27;s fellow Undersecretary, Domenico Tardini, told the Ustaša representative that the Vatican was willing to indulge the Ustaša because: &quot;Croatia is a young state. ... Youngsters often err because of their age. It is therefore not surprising that Croatia also erred.&quot;

Stepinac was summoned to Rome in April 1942, where he delivered a nine-page document detailing various misdeeds of Pavelić. This document described the atrocities as &quot;anomalies&quot; that were either unknown or unauthorized by Pavelić himself; it is omitted from the ADSS. However, by 1942, the Vatican &quot;preferred to have Stepinac try to rein the fascists in rather than risk the effect that a papal denunciation would have on the unstable Croatian state.&quot;

According to Eugene Tisserant, future Dean of the College of Cardinals, &quot;we have the list of all clergymen who participated in these atrocities and we shall punish them at the right time to cleanse our conscience of the stain with which they spotted us.&quot; Pius XII was well-informed of the involvement of Croatian Roman Catholic clergy with the Ustaša, but decided against condemning them or even taking action against the involved clergy, who had &quot;joined in the slaughter&quot;, fearing it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state.

Phayer contrasts the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;limited and sketchy&quot; knowledge of the genocide in Poland with &quot;the Croatian case, in which both the nuncio and the head of the church, Bishop Alojzje Stepinac, were in continuous contact with the Holy See while the genocide was being committed.&quot; Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione instructed nuncio Marcone that &quot;if your eminence can find a suitable occasion, he should recommend in a discreet manner, that would not be interpreted as an official appeal, that moderation be employed with regard to Jews on Croatian territory. Your Eminence should see to it that ... the impression of loyal cooperation with the civil authorities be always preserved.&quot; According to Phayer, the Vatican &quot;preferred to bring diplomatic pressure on the Ushtasha [sic] government instead of challenging the fascists publicly on the immorality of genocide.&quot;

However, according to Professor Rychlak, &quot;Between 1941 and 1944, the Vatican sent four official letters and made numerous oral pleas and protests regarding the deportation of Jews from Slovakia.&quot; Rychlak quotes a letter from Pius himself, dated 7 April 1943: &quot;The Holy See has always entertained the firm hope that the Slovak government, interpreting also the sentiments of its own people, Catholics almost entirely, would never proceed with the forcible removal of persons belonging to the Jewish race. It is therefore with great pain that the Holy See has learned of the continued transfers of such a nature from the territory of the Republic. This pain is aggravated further now that it appears from various reports that the Slovak government intends to proceed with the total removal of the Jewish residents of Slovakia, not even sparing women and children. The Holy See would fail in its Divine Mandate if it did not deplore these measures, which gravely damage man in his natural right, merely for the reason that these people belong to a certain race.&quot;

Rychlak adds:The following day, a message went out from the Holy See instructing its representative in Bulgaria to take steps in support of Jewish residents who were facing deportation. Shortly thereafter, the secretary of the Jewish Agency for Palestine met with Archbishop Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) &quot;to thank the Holy See for the happy outcome of the steps taken on behalf of the Israelites in Slovakia ... [I]n October 1942, a message went out from the Vatican to its representatives in Zagreb regarding the &quot;painful situation that spills out against the Jews in Croatia&quot; and instructing them to petition the government for &quot;a more benevolent treatment of those unfortunates&quot;. The Cardinal Secretary of State&#x27;s notes reflect that Vatican petitions were successful in getting a suspension of &#x27;dispatches of Jews from Croatia&#x27; by January 1943, but Germany was applying pressure for &#x27;an attitude more firm against the Jews&#x27;. Another instruction from the Holy See to its representatives in Zagreb directing them to work on behalf of the Jews went out on 6 March 1943.

==Aftermath==
===Relations with SFR Yugoslavia===

Following the defeat of Axis forces in Croatia in 1945, the Communist Partisan leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito established the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a Communist state which lasted until 1991. Yugoslavia was the only post-war Eastern European Communist state which had not been conquered by the Red Army. After the war, writer Evelyn Waugh, a Roman Catholic convert, advised the British Foreign Office, and Pope Pius XII that Tito &quot;threatens to destroy the Catholic faith in a region where there are now some 5,000,000 Catholics.&quot; According to Phayer, &quot;even before the end of the war, Tito had begun to settle the score with the Ustaša, which meant with the Catholic Church as well, because of the close relations between the two.&quot;

Some of Tito&#x27;s Partisans retaliated against the Catholic clergy for their perceived or actual collaboration with the Ustaše. By February 1945, at least fourteen priests had been killed; by March 1945, as many as 160 priests; by the end of the year, 270 priests. According to Waugh (who visited Croatia after the war), &quot;the task of the partisans was made easier in that the clergy as a whole had undoubtedly compromised the church by tolerating the pro-Axis Ustashis, if not actively collaborating with them.&quot; Franciscans, in particular, were singled out for Partisan attacks and fifteen Franciscan monasteries were destroyed. Pius XII sent an American bishop, Joseph Patrick Hurley, as his envoy to Tito (as Hurley carried the title of &quot;regent&quot;, this was a step below official diplomatic recognition). Tito requested to Hurley that Stepinac be recalled to Rome; the pope, however, deferred to Stepinac, who chose to remain.

===Vatican &quot;ratlines&quot;===
Following the end of the war, clandestine networks smuggled fugitive Axis officials out of Europe. The USA codenamed the activity the &quot;ratline&quot;. In Rome, the pro-Nazi Austrian bishop Alois Hudal was linked to the chain, and the Croatian College offered refuge to many fleeing Croatia, guided by Msgr Krunoslav Draganović.

According to Phayer, &quot;at the end of the war, the leaders of the Ustasha movement, including its clerical supporters such as Bishop Šarić, fled the country, taking gold looted from massacred Jews and Serbs with them to Rome.&quot; Intelligence reports differed over the location of Pavelić himself. Counter Intelligence Corps agent William Gowen (the son of Franklin Gowen, a US diplomat in the Vatican) was one of those tasked with finding Pavelić; although the CIC hoped the relationship would reveal Pavelić&#x27;s location, eventually, Phayer wrote, the opposite occurred and the Vatican convinced the US to back off.

By Phayer&#x27;s account, Pope Pius XII protected Ante Pavelić after World War II, gave him &quot;refuge in the Vatican properties in Rome&quot;, and assisted in his flight to South America; Pavelić and Pius XII shared the goal of a Catholic state in the Balkans and were unified in their opposition to the rising Communist state under Tito. By Hebblethwaite&#x27;s account, Pavelić was hidden in a Salzburg convent until 1948, then brought to Rome by Draganović, who &quot;was a law unto himself and ran his own show and lodged him in the Collegio Pio Latino Americano disguised as &#x27;Father Gomez&#x27;&quot; until Perón invited him to Argentina. Phayer wrote that, after arriving in Rome in 1946, Pavelić used the Vatican &quot;ratline&quot; to reach Argentina in 1948, along with other Ustaša, Russian, Yugoslav, Italian, and American spies and agents all tried to apprehend Pavelić in Rome but the Vatican refused all cooperation and vigorously defended its extraterritorial status. Pavelić was never captured or tried for his crimes, escaping to Argentina, where he was eventually shot by a Montenegrin-Yugoslav agent; he later died of his injuries. According to Phayer, &quot;the Vatican&#x27;s motivation for harboring Pavelić grew in lockstep with its apprehension about Tito&#x27;s treatment of the church.&quot;

Dozens of Croatians, including war criminals, were housed in the Pontifical Croatian College of St Jerome in Rome. By the spring of 1947, the Vatican was putting intense diplomatic pressure on the US and the UK not to extradite Ustaša war criminals to Yugoslavia. Special Agent Gowen warned in 1947 that, due to Pavelić&#x27;s record of opposing the Orthodox Church as well as Communism, his &quot;contacts are so high and his present position is so compromising to the Vatican, that any extradition of the subject would be a staggering blow to the Roman Catholic Church.&quot; Phayer contends that the feared embarrassment of the Church was not due to Pavelić&#x27;s use of the Vatican &quot;ratline&quot; (which Pavelić at this point, still hoping to return, had not yet committed to using), but rather due to the facts the Vatican believed would be revealed in an eventual trial of Pavelić, which never occurred.

Phayer wrote that Pius XII believed Pavelić and other war criminals could not get a fair trial in Yugoslavia. During this period, across Central and Eastern Europe, a number of prominent Catholics were being punished in reprisals, or silenced as potential sources of dissent by the new Communist governments being formed. The priest-collaborator Joseph Tiso, former President of the Nazi puppet state of Slovakia, was hanged as a war criminal. Rome had been advised that Communist Yugoslavia was threatening to destroy Catholicism throughout the country. In this climate, the Church faced the prospect that the risk of handing over the innocent could be &quot;greater than the danger that some of the guilty should escape.&quot;

According to Eugene Tisserant, future Dean of the College of Cardinals, &quot;we have the list of all clergymen who participated in these atrocities and we shall punish them at the right time to cleanse our conscience of the stain with which they spotted us.&quot; Pius XII was well-informed of the involvement of Croatian Roman Catholic clergy with the Ustaša, but decided against condemning them or even taking action against the involved clergy, who had &quot;joined in the slaughter&quot;, fearing it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state.

===Post-war trials===
;Rožman
Bishop Gregorij Rožman of Ljubljana was the first bishop tried for &quot;collaboration&quot; in Yugoslavia, &quot;in absentia&quot;, by the military court in August 1946. The case was reopened in 2007 by the Slovene Supreme Court and the 1946 verdict was annulled on procedural grounds. The British occupational authorities recommended he &quot;be arrested and interned as a Ustaša collaborator&quot;. Phayer views his trial as a &quot;warm-up for proceedings against Stepinac.&quot; After Rožman was convicted, Stepinac was arrested. Rožman emigrated to the U.S. sometime after the war and found a haven in the United States through the intercession of influential clerics. He died in the U.S., a legal alien but not a U.S. citizen.

;Stepinac

The Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, was brought to trial by the Yugoslav government on 26 September 1946. Hebblethwaite called it a &quot;showtrial for dramatic effect with the verdict decided in advance, it had nothing to do with justice or evidence.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported in October 1946 that:In a Zagreb sports auditorium, brilliantly lit for photographers and 500 spectators, the show trial of Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac and twelve Catholic priests was rolling to a close. Charged by Marshal Tito with &quot;crimes against the people&quot;, the 48-year-old head of the world&#x27;s fifth largest Catholic diocese ... temporarily lost his equanimity. He shook an angry finger at the court, cried: &quot;Not only does the church in Yugoslavia have no freedom, but in a short while the church will be annihilated.&quot;

Stepinac was indicted on charges of supporting the Ustaše government, encouraging forcible conversions of Orthodox Serbs, and encouraging Ustaše resistance in Yugoslavia. He repeatedly refused to defend himself against the charges and was sentenced to sixteen years in prison. Phayer argues that Stepinac could have defended himself from the charge of supporting forced conversions, but not the other two charges. Hebblethwaite wrote that Stepinac&#x27;s support for Croatian independence had been based on the Atlantic Charter and the principle that all nations have a right to exist.

Archbishop Stepinac served 5 years in Lepoglava prison before the sentence was commuted to house arrest. Pope Pius XII elevated Stepinac to the College of Cardinals in 1952. Although Phayer agrees that Stepinac&#x27;s conviction was the result of a &quot;show trial&quot;, Phayer also states that &quot;the charge that he supported the Ustaša regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew,&quot; and that &quot;if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican&#x27;s support of the genocidal Pavelić.&quot; Stepinac had allowed state papers from the Ustaše to be stored in his episcopal residence, papers crucial to the Ustaše in retaking control of the country and which contained volumes of incriminating information against Ustaše war criminals. Stepinac was transferred back home to the village of Krašić in 1953 and died in his residence seven years later. In 1998, Pope John Paul II beatified him.

===Ustaše gold===

The Ustaše hiding in Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome brought a large amount of looted gold with them; this was later moved to other Vatican extraterritorial property and/or the Vatican Bank. Although this gold would be worth hundreds of thousands of 2008 US dollars, it constituted only a small percentage of the gold looted during World War II, mostly by the Nazis. According to Phayer, &quot;top Vatican personnel would have known the whereabouts of the gold.&quot;

Surviving victims of the Ustaše and their next of kin living in California brought a class action lawsuit against the Vatican bank and others in US federal court, &quot;Alperin v. Vatican Bank&quot;. Specifically, the Vatican bank was charged with laundering and converting &quot;the Ustaša treasury, making deposits in Europe and North and South American, [and] distributing the funds to exiled Ustaša leaders including Pavelić&quot;. A principal piece of evidence against the Vatican is the &quot;Bigelow dispatch&quot;, a 16 October 1946 dispatch from Emerson Bigelow in Rome to Harold Glasser, the director of monetary research for the U.S. Treasury Department.

Former OSS agent William Gowen gave a deposition as an expert witness that in 1946 Colonel Ivan Babić transported ten truckloads of gold from Switzerland to the Pontifical College. All the charges were eventually dismissed.

==Croatia==
The Catholic Church in Croatia is criticised by some for promoting and tolerating neo-fascism among its ranks.

Each year in December, the Catholic church in Croatia holds the annual memorial mass dedicated to Ustasha fascist dictator Ante Pavelić in Zagreb and Split. These masses are known to attract groups of Pavelić&#x27;s supporters dressed in clothes with Ustasha insignia.

During the funeral of convicted ustasha WWII concentration camp commander Dinko Šakić, priest Vjekoslav Lasić said that &quot;every honest Croat should be proud of Šakić&#x27;s name&quot; and that &quot;court which convicted Šakić, also convicted Croatia and its people&quot;. These statements were strongly condemned by Simon Wiesenthal Center and Croatian Helsinki Committee.

Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was criticised on live TV by Croatian friar Luka Prcela for saying that the Independent State of Croatia was a criminal state and wasn&#x27;t independent. Prcela said that the Independent State of Croatia &quot;never killed anyone outside its own borders&quot; and that former two left-wing presidents of Croatia were &quot;anti-Croatian&quot;.

In 2017, Bishop of Sisak Vlado Košić was one of the signatories of a petition for the introduction of the fascist Ustasha movement salute &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; to the official use in the Croatian Armed Forces. On 1 July, Don Anđelko Kaćunko held a memorial mass for Ustasha Black Legion commander Jure Francetić on which he described Francetić as &quot;a patriot who was willing to give his life for the homeland&quot;. On 2 July, media published a picture of a Croatian Catholic priest posing for a picture with a group of young boys on a children&#x27;s football tournament in Široki Brijeg, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their team was named &quot;The Black Legion&quot; and boys were all wearing black T-shirts, thus alluding to notorious ustasha militia of the same name. On 2 September, while holding a mass near the town of Sinj, friar Božo Norac Kljajo equalized &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; and &quot;Praised be Jesus&quot; by saying that these are &quot;both good intentioned, human and ancient Christian salutes which don&#x27;t hold a single drop of hate or vengeance.&quot;

Upon the death of Slavko Goldstein in September 2017, a prominent Croatian writer and publisher of Jewish origin, Mili Plenković, pastor of Hvar, published a Facebook post in which he expressed that he was &quot;happy upon hearing the news that Goldstein died&quot; because according to him: &quot;yet another hater of Croatia vanished from this world&quot;.

==Notable people==
*Krunoslav Draganović (1903–1983), Catholic priest, organized Ratlines.
*Tomislav Filipović-Majstorović (1915–1946; born Miroslav Filipović), Franciscan friar and Jasenovac camp commander infamous for his sadism and cruelty, known as &quot;brother Satan&quot;. Captured by Partisans, tried and executed in 1946.
*Petar Brzica (1917–?), Franciscan friar who won a contest on 29 August 1942 after cutting the throats of 1,360 inmates at the Jasenovac concentration camp. His post-war fate is unknown.

<text>A push poll is an interactive marketing technique, most commonly employed during political campaigning, in which a person or organization attempts to manipulate or alter prospective voters&#x27; views under the guise of conducting an opinion poll. In a push poll, large numbers of voters are contacted with little effort made to collect and analyze their response data. Instead, the push poll is a form of telemarketing-based propaganda and rumor-mongering masquerading as an opinion poll. Push polls may rely on innuendo, or information gleaned from opposition research on the political opponent of the interests behind the poll.

Generally, push polls are viewed as a form of negative campaigning. Indeed, the term is commonly (and confusingly) used in a broader sense to refer to legitimate polls that aim to test negative political messages. Future usage of the term will determine whether the strict or broad definition becomes the most favored, but in all such polls, the pollster asks leading questions or suggestive questions that &quot;push&quot; the interviewee toward adopting an unfavourable response toward the political candidate or issue in question.

Legislation in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory defined push-polling as any activity conducted as part of a telephone call made, or a meeting held, during the election period for an election, that: (a) is, or appears to be, a survey (for example, a telephone opinion call or telemarketing call); and (b) is intended to influence an elector in deciding their vote.

Push polling has been condemned by the American Association of Political Consultants and the American Association for Public Opinion Research.

== Origin ==
Richard Nixon pioneered push polling. In his very first campaign, a 1946 run for the U.S. House against incumbent Jerry Voorhis, voters throughout the district reported receiving telephone calls that began: &quot;This is a friend of yours, but I can&#x27;t tell you who I am. Did you know that Jerry Voorhis is a communist?&quot; (Voorhis was not)—at which point the caller hung up. A citizen reported that she worked for the Nixon campaign for $9 ($ in ) a day in a telephone-bank room where the attack calls were made. Nixon later admitted he knew Voorhis was not a communist, but the important thing was to win.

== Types and their effects ==
The mildest forms of push polling are designed merely to remind voters of a particular issue. For instance, a push poll might ask respondents to rank candidates based on their support of an issue in order to get voters thinking about that issue.

Many push polls are negative attacks on candidates. These often contain suggestions not stated as facts. They ask questions such as &quot;If you knew that Candidate Smith was being investigated for corruption, would you be more likely to vote for him or less likely?&quot; The question does not say that any investigation has taken place, so it is not a lie, but it puts in the respondent&#x27;s mind the idea that Candidate Smith may be corrupt.

True push polls tend to be very short, with only a handful of questions, to maximise the number of calls that can be made. Any data obtained (if used at all) is secondary in importance to the resulting negative effect on the targeted candidate. Legitimate polls are often used by candidates to test potential messages. They frequently ask about either positive and negative statements about any or all major candidates in an election and always include demographic questions.

Push polls&#x27; main advantage is that they are an effective way to malign an opponent (&quot;pushing&quot; voters toward a predetermined point of view) while avoiding direct responsibility for the distorted or false information suggested (but not directly alleged) in the push poll. They are risky for the same reason: if credible evidence emerges that the polls were directly ordered by a campaign or candidate, it could do serious damage to that campaign. Push polls are also relatively expensive, having a far higher cost per voter than radio or television commercials. Consequently, push polls are most used in elections with fewer voters, such as party primaries, or in close elections where a relatively small change in votes can make the difference between victory or defeat.

== Examples ==

=== Australia ===
In March 2011, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the Australian Labor Party was referred to the New South Wales Electoral Commission after it was alleged to have used &quot;push polling&quot; in Newcastle to discredit independent candidate John Stuart Tate. Labor Party officials employed a market research firm to conduct the polling, telling voters that Tate was the Labor mayor of Newcastle when in fact he was not. It has been suggested that Labor was worried its brand was so damaged in one of its traditional seats that it branded the popular independent as one of its own to discredit him. Labor polling firm Fieldworks Market Research admitted to the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that the script used when calling voters branded Tate a &quot;Labor&quot; candidate, but said the Labor Party provided the script. It is not publicly known whether the Electoral Commission responded to this referral.

=== United States ===

Political consultant Lee Atwater was well known for using push-polling among his aggressive campaign tactics. He apologised for this in later life.

George W. Bush used push polls in his 1994 bid for Texas Governor against incumbent Ann Richards. Callers asked voters &quot;whether they would be more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if they knew that lesbians dominated on her staff&quot;.

In the 2000 United States Republican Party primaries, it was alleged that Bush&#x27;s campaign used push polling against Senator John McCain. Voters in South Carolina reportedly were asked, &quot;Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child?&quot; This hypothetical question seemed like a suggestion, although without substance. It was heard by thousands of primary voters.

In the 2008 presidential election, Jewish voters in several states were targeted by various push polls that linked Barack Obama to various anti-Israel positions. For example, various push polls suggested that Obama was a Muslim; that his church was anti-American and anti-Israel; that he often met pro-Palestinian leaders in Chicago (and had met PLO leaders); that a Hamas leader had endorsed him; and that he had called for a summit of Muslim nations excluding Israel if elected president. The Jewish Council for Education and Research, an organization that endorsed Obama, denounced the push polls as disinformation and lies.

Amid widespread controversy over the Trump administration&#x27;s executive order restricting immigration from the Middle East, the Republican Party sent out a poll to supporters on February 17, 2017, titled &quot;Mainstream Media Accountability&quot;, which included such questions as &quot;Do you believe that the media unfairly reported on President Trump’s executive order temporarily restricting people entering our country from nations compromised by radical Islamic terrorism?&quot; and &quot;Were you aware that a poll was released revealing that a majority of Americans actually supported President Trump&#x27;s temporary restriction executive order?&quot; Trump&#x27;s campaign used similar tactics throughout the 2020 United States presidential election.

=== United Kingdom ===
In &quot;The Ministerial Broadcast&quot;, a 1986 episode of the satirical television program &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby (portrayed by Nigel Hawthorne), demonstrates push polling to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley (portrayed by Derek Fowlds), with respect to the policy of reintroducing National Service:

Appleby demonstrates that, with Woolley answering in the affirmative to the leading questions, he would find it difficult to argue against the desired policy. Appleby then alleges that disreputable polling companies would discard the leading questions and provide only the results for the main question.

In 2024, polling firm Ipsos released two 1,000-respondent polls demonstrating that, if the first set of questions was asked, the reintroduction of national service had a 45% to 38% margin of support, whereas if the second set of questions was asked, reintroduction was opposed by a margin of 48% to 34%. Ipsos&#x27;s polling was meant to demonstrate the danger of push-polling—especially in an election year—and promote the resiliency of British Polling Council rules that seek to prevent it.

==Legal actions==
The parliament of the Northern Territory (Australia) has legislated to restrict push polling in that, during an election, the caller is required to identify his/her name and address.

The state legislature has attempted to restrict the practice in New Hampshire.

<doc id="704179" wikidata="Q61675" url="?curid=704179" title="Detlef Schrempf">
<text>Detlef Schrempf (born January 21, 1963) is a German-American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Washington Huskies from 1981 to 1985, and was drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA) by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft, with the eighth overall pick. He was an All-NBA Third Team member in 1995, a three-time NBA All-Star, the first European player ever to achieve this award, and the NBA Sixth Man of the Year twice.

Schrempf played in the NBA for 16 seasons, including stints with the Indiana Pacers, the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Portland Trail Blazers. In 1996, he reached the NBA Finals with the SuperSonics. He played for the West German, and later German, national team in the 1984 and 1992 Summer Olympics and the 1983 and 1985 EuroBasket championships. Schrempf was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2021.

==High school and college career==
Born in Leverkusen, West Germany, Schrempf played for the youth teams of Bayer Leverkusen, before attending Centralia High School in Centralia, Washington, United States, for one year. As a senior, he led the Tigers to the Class AA (now 2A) state championship in 1981, scoring 24 points in the title game, a 52–43 victory over the Timberline Blazers of Lacey. After graduating he enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he played for the Huskies under head coach Marv Harshman. With Schrempf, the Huskies won Pac-10 regular-season titles in 1984 and 1985 and made three postseason appearances, reaching the Sweet 16 in 1984. He was named team captain for his senior year. In his career at Washington, he scored 1,449 total points.

Schrempf was named to the All-Pac-10 First Team and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-America Second Team. He was inducted into the Husky Hall of Fame in 1995, and was also named to the University of Washington All-Century Team. While attending UW, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and majored in international business.

==NBA career==
Schrempf was selected eighth overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1985 NBA draft. He became a regular in NBA rotations after being traded to the Indiana Pacers for veteran center Herb Williams in February 1989. Playing for the Mavericks, he finished second in the NBA with a .478 three-point percentage in 1986–87, and eventually worked his way into the starting lineup. In 1991 and 1992, he won consecutive NBA Sixth Man Awards. In the 1992–93 season, he was the only player in the NBA to finish in the top 25 in scoring (19.1 ppg), rebounding (9.5 rpg) and assists (6.0 apg), and was the first European selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game, the first of his three appearances.

Following the 1992–93 NBA season, Schrempf was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics for forwards Derrick McKey and Gerald Paddio. He ranked second in the NBA in three-point accuracy during the 1994–95 season with a 51.4 three-point field goal percentage and became leader in the NBA in offensive rating the same season with 127 points per 100 possessions. On a Sonics team that also featured Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Sam Perkins, and Hersey Hawkins, Schrempf reached the NBA Finals in 1996, where they lost to Michael Jordan&#x27;s Chicago Bulls in six games. Schrempf became the first (and one of only four, to date, along with Dirk Nowitzki, Daniel Theis, and Maxi Kleber) German-born NBA player to reach the NBA Finals. While with the Sonics, Schrempf played in the NBA All-Star game in both 1995 and 1997.

Schrempf was released by the Sonics in 1999 and signed the same day by the Portland Trail Blazers, with whom he played until his retirement from professional basketball in 2001, playing in a total of 1,136 regular season games and 114 playoff games.

On January 24, 2006, the Seattle SuperSonics hired Schrempf as an assistant coach under Bob Hill, who had coached Schrempf when he played for the Indiana Pacers.

==National team career==
Schrempf first appeared for the West Germany national team at the EuroBasket in 1983. He also led the team in scoring during the event at 15.3 ppg. A year later, he led the team to the 1984 Olympics. In 1985, Schrempf helped West Germany to their best finish at the EuroBasket in their history to that point. Seven years later, at the 1992 Olympics, he represented the team for his last international tournament.

==Charitable work==
Schrempf established the Detlef Schrempf Foundation in 1996 to benefit local charities. In January 2012, he won the Paul Allen Award for Citizenship (formerly the ) at the 77th annual Sports Star of the Year banquet in Seattle. His foundation hosts the Detlef Schrempf Celebrity Golf Classic at McCormick Woods Golf Course in Port Orchard, Washington, each summer and has raised about $10 million for children&#x27;s charities in the Pacific Northwest.

<doc id="704182" wikidata="Q940814" url="?curid=704182" title="Tetisheri">
<text>Tetisheri was the matriarch of the Egyptian royal family of the late 17th Dynasty and early 18th Dynasty.

==Family==
===Non-royal parentage===
Tetisheri was the daughter of Tjenna and Neferu. The names of Tetisheri&#x27;s parents appear to be non-royal and are known from mummy bandages found in TT320.

===Marriage===
It is believed she married Senakhtenre, and despite her non-royal birth became a Great Royal Wife. Tetisheri was the mother of Seqenenre Tao, Queen Ahhotep I and possibly Kamose. For sure she was the mother of Satdjehuty/Satibu, as attested on the rishi coffin of the latter.

At Abydos, her grandson king Ahmose I erected a Stela of Queen Tetisheri to announce the construction of a pyramid and a &quot;house&quot; for Tetisheri. Ahmose refers to the Queen as &quot;the mother of my mother, and the mother of my father, great king&#x27;s wife and king&#x27;s mother, Tetisheri&quot; (Breasted). This implies that his parents were siblings or half-siblings. Ahmose I was born to Ahhotep I.

==Burial==
Tetisheri was likely buried in Thebes and she may have been reinterred in the royal cache in TT320.
No tomb at Thebes has yet been conclusively identified with Queen Tetisheri, though a mummy that may be hers, known as &quot;Unknown Woman B&quot;, was included among other members of the royal family reburied in the Royal Cache.

Pharaoh Ahmose had a memorial structure or cenotaph at Abydos erected in her honour, in the midst of his own extensive mortuary complex at that site. This mudbrick structure was discovered in 1902 by the Egypt Exploration Fund, and was found to contain a monumental stela detailing the dedication by Ahmose I and his sister-wife Ahmose-Nefertari of a pyramid and enclosure (or shrine) to Tetisheri.
Its discoverer, C. T. Currelly, believed the textual reference to a &quot;pyramid&quot; of Tetisheri to refer not to the building in which the stela was found, but rather to the more imposing pyramid associated with a large mortuary temple at its base discovered in 1900 by A. C. Mace. Based on recent discoveries, however, this view can no longer be maintained. The foundations of the structure, originally described by Currelly in 1903 as a &quot;shrine&quot; or &quot;mastaba,&quot; was demonstrated in 2004 through the renewed excavations of the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago under the direction of S. Harvey to have actually formed the lowest courses of a brick pyramid, the last queen&#x27;s pyramid to have been built in Egypt. Portions of the limestone pyramidion or capstone were discovered as well, demonstrating conclusively that this structure was pyramidal in form. Magnetic survey also revealed a brick enclosure some 70 by 90 meters in scale, a feature not detected by earlier archaeologists. These accordingly may now be identified as the features described in Ahmose&#x27;s stela found within: a pyramid and an enclosure, built in the midst of Ahmose&#x27;s own mortuary complex.

==Attestations==
=== Statuette (fake?) ===
A statuette long in the collections of the British Museum bearing an inscription naming Tetisheri was identified as a forgery by W. V. Davies, based on the slavish imitation of its inscription from a fragmentary lower portion of a similar statue of the queen (now lost). However, some scholars question this attribution, and have been raising questions as to the potential authenticity of the statuette itself, if not the inscription.

*Petrie UC 14402 | At Armant, a stela with the royal name of Nebpethy Ahmose mentions King&#x27;s Mother Teti (mwt-nsw ttj, cartouche) and some restorations of the local temple. The epithet &quot;Sherit&quot; (šrt) is missing. A feature with the stela is that the jꜥḥ-sign (N11/N12) in the name of Ahmose was turned upside down.

<text>Barry Pinches (born 13 July 1970 in Catton, Norwich) is an English former professional snooker player, recognisable for his bright and flamboyant waistcoats, which usually feature the yellow and green colours of Norwich City F.C. He is a former top 32 player and ranking-event quarter-finalist. He has compiled over 100 century breaks in his career. He has also made one maximum break.

==Career==
Pinches was born on 13 July 1970. He won the English Amateur Championship in 1988, enabling him to turn professional in 1989. He was runner-up to James Wattana at the 1988 World Amateur Championship.

After a largely unsuccessful start to his career, he hit good form for a while in the 2000s. He defeated Jimmy White 10–8 in the 2004 World Championship, in a match which overran and had to be completed after other matches, then led Stephen Hendry 11–9 before losing 12–13 and has lost in the first round twice more – the 13-year gap between his first two Crucible appearances (1991–2004) is an all-time record. In his first appearance at the Crucible, in 1991 he lost 3–10 to Terry Griffiths. His best ranking tournament run to date, was in the 2003 UK Championship, where he reached the quarter-finals with victories over Marco Fu, Graeme Dott and Stephen Lee, before Stephen Hendry ended his run.

At one point he was established in the world&#x27;s top 32, and provisionally 14 at one point – advancing 82–56–36–21 in the rankings over a strong sequence of seasons up to 2003–04. However, he dropped out of the top 32 two years later, and then won only one knock-out match in 2006–07, dropping to number #56. He attributed this loss of form to attempting to change his cue action. However, he won an invitational event that featured many top players, the 2007 Paul Hunter Classic that August, beating Neil Robertson and Ken Doherty en route. 
He also showed a return to form in the 2008 China Open by reaching the last 16, beating the defending champion, Graeme Dott 5–1 in the process, before going down by the same scoreline to Nigel Bond, who also beat him 7–10 in the final qualifying round of the 2008 World Championship. The 2008/2009 season was less successful for him however.

After reaching the final of Event 2 of the Players Tour Championship where he lost 3–4 to Mark Selby he went one better in Event 4 beating Mark Williams 4–1 and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 4–3 in the semi-final and final respectively to record the best win of his career to date.

In the 2011–12 season Pinches narrowly missed out on a maximum 147 break at Event 2 of the Players Tour Championship in Gloucester, making it to the final black. 
He would later finish the season ranked world number 64, grabbing the final spot on offer through the world rankings to play in the 2012–13 season. He fell 23 places in the rankings during the season – the most of anyone on the snooker tour.

Pinches won two matches but then lost in the final round in qualifying for the first three ranking events of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He made it to the main draw at the next event, the 2012 International Championship, thanks to wins over Daniel Wells, Xiao Guodong and Joe Perry. He had to play in a wildcard round once at the venue in Chengdu, China, and lost 5–6 to Lu Ning. This was the furthest Pinches got in a ranking event this season, with it coming to an end when he was defeated 9–10 by Liam Highfield in the second round of World Championship Qualifying. He finished the year ranked world number 62.

Pinches qualified for the 2013 Indian Open, the fourth ranking event of the 2013–14 season with a 4–1 victory over Chris Wakelin. He almost pulled off a huge shock in the first round as he led Ding Junhui 3–2, but was beaten 4–3. Pinches also reached the main draw of the World Open and China Open but lost in the first round both times.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to all 128 players on the tour earning a place in the first round of the Welsh Open, Pinches did not need to qualify and beat Nigel Bond 4–1, to set up a second round meeting with Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Pinches stated before the match that he would stick to his percentage game with a defensive approach as he has always played the same no matter who the opponent is and he was defeated 4–1. Pinches had a consistent season in the European Tour events with his deepest runs being last 16 defeats at the Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup and Gdynia Open which saw him finish 49th on the Order of Merit. He dropped out of the top 64 in the rankings during the season as he ended it at number 76, but his European Tour results earned him a place on the tour for the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons as the sixth highest non-qualified player.

He edged out Peter Ebdon 5–4 to qualify for the 2014 Wuxi Classic, but lost 5–1 to Yan Bingtao in the first round. Pinches won three games to play in the final qualifying round for the Australian Goldfields Open where he lost 5–3 to Ebdon. He qualified for the International Championship and was beaten 6–2 by Robert Milkins in the opening round. Pinches&#x27; sole win in a ranking event this season came at the Welsh Open by defeating Jimmy White 4–3, but he was knocked out 4–2 by home favourite Mark Williams in the second round.-

Pinches had a very poor 2015–16 season as he only won two matches all year, both of these coming at the Haining Open. He was involved in two frames of note during the season. At the Ruhr Open, Pinches and Alan McManus set the record for the longest official snooker frame at 100 minutes and 24 seconds. The record stood until April 2017. In the final frame of his 4–1 defeat of Pinches in the first round of the Welsh Open, Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan learned that the prize for making a 147 was £10,000 and decided after potting the 14th red to pot a pink and make a 146 instead as the prize money was not enough. Pinches dropped off the tour at the end of the season and he failed to regain his place on the main tour through the 2016 Q School. He qualified for the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic, but lost 4–3 to Cao Yupeng in the first round.

In the 2017 Gibraltar Open, Pinches lost in the second qualifying round; however, during the 2017–18 season, having again lost in Q-School in his attempt to re-qualify for the main tour, he qualified for that season&#x27;s Paul Hunter Classic. He recovered from 1–3 behind in the first round to beat Matthew Bolton 4–3, but lost in the last 64 to fellow amateur George Pragnall by the same scoreline.
On 14 October 2017 Barry entered the World Seniors Championship 1st Qualifying in Newbury for the Snooker Legends Tour. He lost 1–3 in the semi-finals to fellow amateur Matt Ford. In the frame that he won in the semi-finals he made a total clearance of 133 and won a pair of Oakley sunglasses for the highest break of the event.
He entered the 2018 Q School in May in the hope of winning back his place on the main snooker tour. In the second round he was drawn against his son Luke. It was the first time a father played his son in a world snooker event since Neal Foulds played his father Geoff Foulds in 1986. Barry beat son Luke 4–1. In the following round he defeated fellow former pro Fang Xiongman.

In June 2019, Pinches came through the third event of the 2019 Q School by winning six matches to earn a two-year card on the World Snooker Tour for the 2019–2020 and 2020–21 seasons.

In June 2021, Pinches came through event 2 of the 2021 Q School by winning five matches to earn a two-year card on the World Snooker Tour for the 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 seasons.

<doc id="704187" wikidata="Q539372" url="?curid=704187" title="Peter Šťastný">
<text>Peter Šťastný (; born 18 September 1956), also known colloquially as &quot;Peter the Great&quot; and &quot;Stosh&quot;, is a Slovak-Canadian former professional ice hockey player and politician who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1980 to 1995. Šťastný is the second-highest scorer of the 1980s, after Wayne Gretzky. During his time with the Quebec Nordiques, Šťastný became a Canadian citizen. From 2004 to 2014, he served as a Member of the European Parliament for Slovakia. During his NHL career, he played with the Quebec Nordiques, New Jersey Devils, and St. Louis Blues.

He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998 and ranks 34th all time in NHL points (and second overall for players born in Slovakia). He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2017, Šťastný was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. He is also the father of former NHL forward Paul Stastny.

==NHL career==
Šťastný was a prolific scorer in the NHL in the 1980s. He started his career in the NHL with the Quebec Nordiques in 1980 and was traded in 1990 to the New Jersey Devils. As a star member of a team playing in a francophone city, Šťastný endeared himself to the Quebec fans by learning to speak French, and later learned to speak English. He retired as a member of the St. Louis Blues in 1995.

When the startling news broke in 1980 that Czechoslovakia player of the year, Šťastný, and his brother, Anton, had defected to Canada to play with the Quebec Nordiques, it represented a watershed moment in professional ice hockey as one of the first major stars of Eastern bloc hockey to join the NHL. The following year, his brother, Marián, joined them and they became the third trio of brothers to play on the same professional ice hockey team (the first being the Bentley brothers of the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1940s and the second being the Plager brothers of the St. Louis Blues in the 1970s). Peter and Anton share the rookie record for points in a game, with 8, which they accomplished in the same game against the Washington Capitals on February 22, 1981. Two days earlier, they each recorded six points against the Vancouver Canucks. These two games, played two days apart, are four out of the nine total instances in which rookies have recorded at least 6 points in a game.

The trickle of Czechoslovak and Soviet hockey players rapidly became a flood following his footsteps. According to Peter, his defection &quot;was the best decision I ever made. It has given my family the choices and options that people behind the Iron Curtain could only dream of. Then, to play pro hockey with my two brothers was like icing on the cake.&quot;

On the ice, Peter proved to be both consistent and productive. He scored 450 goals and added 789 assists for a total of 1239 points in the regular season. After retiring as a player, he captained the Slovak national team in various international tournaments and still enjoys huge popularity among Slovaks.

===NHL milestones and records===

*1st player in NHL history to collect over 100 points in rookie year (109). Note: Wayne Gretzky had 137 points in his first year in the NHL (1979–80), but was not considered a &quot;rookie&quot;, due to his time spent with the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Indianapolis Racers and Edmonton Oilers, where he won the rookie of the year award in that league during the 1978–79 season with 110 points.
*Shares NHL record for assists by a rookie (70) with Joé Juneau (Gretzky had 86 assists in his first year).
*Holds NHL record for points in a game by a rookie with 8 (four goals and four assists on 22 February 1981 against Washington Capitals).
*Holds NHL record for points in a road game with 8 (four goals and four assists on 22 February 1981 against Washington Capitals).
*Holds NHL record for points in 2 consecutive games with 14 (3 goals and 3 assists on 20 February 1981 against Vancouver Canucks and 4 goals and 4 assists on 22 February 1981 against Washington Capitals).
*Holds Colorado Avalanche franchise record for hat tricks with 16.

==Personal life==
Šťastný was born in Bratislava, the fourth son of Stanislav and Frantiska Šťastný. His two older brothers, Vladimir (born 1945) and Bohumil (born 1947), were born when the family still lived in the village of Pružina, about 170 kilometres northeast of Bratislava. They moved to Bratislava before the birth of Marián (1953), Peter (1956), Anton (1959), and Eva (1966). Stanislav worked for a state-run company that built hydro-electric dams until 1980 when he retired, and mainly dealt with managing inventory. Frantiska stayed at home and raised the children. Vladimir served as an assistant coach of the Slovak national ice hockey team. He is the only coach with all three medals in Slovak ice hockey history.

Peter is the father of Yan Stastny, and Paul Stastny. Paul began his career with the Colorado Avalanche (the same franchise as the Quebec Nordiques, Peter&#x27;s first NHL team) in 2006–07, followed by the St. Louis Blues, for whom Peter also played. Paul also played for the Vegas Golden Knights, Winnipeg Jets and Carolina Hurricanes, before retiring in 2023. Yan made his NHL debut in 2005–06 with the Edmonton Oilers and last played professionally for the EHC Lustenau in 2018. Born in Quebec City but raised in St. Louis, Yan played for Team USA in the 2005 and 2006 World Championships. Paul would represent Team USA in the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2014 Winter Olympics. The family is the first ice hockey family known to have represented four countries in international play (Czechoslovakia, Canada, Slovakia, United States). Paul broke the record for a scoring streak in a rookie season in the NHL and was a finalist for the 2006–07 Calder Memorial Trophy, which was won by his father in 1980–81.

==Career in politics==

Šťastný has always been known for his resentment of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. He joined the party SDKÚ-DS of the former Prime-minister Mikuláš Dzurinda to pursue a career in the European Parliament since he is fluent in both English and French. He was elected as leader of the 2004 European Parliament candidate list for the SDKU.

In the June 2009 election he was re-elected as the second of his party&#x27;s MEPs. His campaign slogan was &quot;With Courage and Determination for a Strong Slovakia&quot; (Slovak: S odvahou a nasadením pre silné Slovensko). He was MEP until 2014.
He is a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

==Široký controversy==
Šťastný has called for Juraj Široký to step-down as the President of Slovak Ice Hockey Federation, stating poor performance, pursuing own financial interests over the welfare of Slovak Hockey as well as moral incredibility after it was revealed that Mr Široký was former ŠtB officer and he still has not sufficiently explained his friendship and involvement with Viktor Kožený and his fraudulent financial manoeuvres regarding so-called Harvard Funds. These grievances were penned in a letter to René Fasel in a letter describing Široký as a threat to democracy and integrity of the game in March 2008, as a result of Široký&#x27;s actions in the 1980s (during which time Peter and two of his brothers had defected to Canada). Three months later, with Široký having not resigned from HC Slovan Bratislava, for whom Šťastný had played prior to his defection to Canada, or the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation, Šťastný resigned from the Slovak Hockey Hall of Fame as a result, and had all references to him pulled from Samsung Arena, the home arena of Slovan at the time.

==International play==




Šťastný was the first player in ice hockey history to represent three countries in three international tournaments.

<doc id="704189" wikidata="Q1052589" url="?curid=704189" title="Cedega (software)">
<text>Cedega (formerly known as WineX) was the proprietary fork by TransGaming Technologies of Wine, from the last version of Wine under the X11 license before switching to GNU LGPL. It was designed specifically for running games created for Microsoft Windows under Linux. As such, its primary focus was implementing the DirectX API. WineX was renamed to Cedega on the release of version 4.0 on June 22, 2004.

Cedega Gaming Service was retired on February 28, 2011. TransGaming announced that development would continue under the GameTree Linux Developer Program, however this proved moot as the company&#x27;s core technology divisions were shuttered in 2016.

==Licenses==
Though Cedega was mainly proprietary software, TransGaming did make part of the source publicly available via CVS, under a mix of licenses. Though this was mainly done to allow a means for the public to view and submit fixes to the code, it was also frequently used as a means to obtain a quasi-demonstration version of Cedega. TransGaming released a proper demo of Cedega because of complaints of the difficulty of building a usable version of the program from the public CVS, as well as its outdated nature. The demo released by Cedega gave users a 14-day trial of a reasonably current version of the product with a watermark of the Cedega logo which faded from almost transparent to fully opaque every few seconds. This demo was removed without comment.

While the licenses under which the code was released do permit non-commercial redistribution of precompiled public-CVS versions of the software, TransGaming strongly discouraged this, openly warning that the license would be changed if they felt that abuse was occurring or otherwise threatened. TransGaming similarly discouraged source-based distributions like Gentoo Linux from creating automated tools to let people build their own version of Cedega from the public CVS.

The Wine project originally released Wine under the same MIT License as the X Window System, but owing to concern about proprietary versions of Wine not contributing their changes back to the core project, work as of March 2002 has used the LGPL for its licensing.

==Functionality==
In some cases it closely mimicked the experience that Windows users have (insert disc, run Setup.exe, play). In other cases some amount of user tweaking is required to get the game installed and in a state of playability. Cedega 5.2 introduced a feature called the Games Disc Database (GDDB) that simplifies many of these settings and adds auto-game detection when a CD is inserted so that settings are applied for the inserted game automatically.

A basic list of features:

* Some types of copy protection
* Pixel Shaders 3.0
* Vertex Shaders 3.0
* DirectX 9.0
* Joystick support including remapping axes
* The ability to run some Windows games

==History==
Cedega subscribers dwindled as users expressed a number of complaints due to lack of updates, fatal problems with supported games and with Wine having achieved a number of features that were unique to Cedega, giving even better compatibility in some cases. Users attributed the apparent lack of interest from TransGaming on Cedega to their focus on Cider, a similar Wine-based API layer for Mac OS X systems, supported by Electronic Arts to bring their Windows native games to Mac.

On November 13, 2007&#x27;s Development Status report, TransGaming explained that a number of modifications had been made to Cedega&#x27;s code to add Wine&#x27;s implementation of the MSI installation system and to be able to incorporate more of Wine&#x27;s codebase. It was never confirmed if those changes were in conformance with Wine&#x27;s LGPL license.

Also on the November 13, 2007 report, it was announced that all of the work done on Cider would be merged back into Cedega (since both share the same code). Among the new features are “new copy protection, 2.0 shader updates, a head start on shader model 3.0, performance upgrades, a self-updating user interface” and others.
On September 23, 2008, Cedega officially presented the new version 6.1.

Cedega Gaming Service was retired on February 28, 2011.

==Controversy==
TransGaming&#x27;s business practice of benefiting financially from the Wine project, without contributing anything back to it drew criticism. TransGaming obtained the source to the original Wine project when it was under the MIT License and this license placed no requirements on how TransGaming published the software. TransGaming decided to release their version as proprietary software. 

Cedega included licensed support for several types of CD-based copy protection (notably SecuROM and SafeDisc), the code for which TransGaming said they were under contract not to disclose. They had initially pledged to release their code if they reached 20,000 subscribers, but this never actually happened.

In 2002, the Wine project changed its license to the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). This means that anyone who publishes a modified version of Wine after the license change must publish the source code under an LGPL-compatible license. TransGaming halted using code contributed to Wine when the license was changed, though this later resumed with TransGaming integrating certain LGPL portions of Wine into Cedega and placing those portions of the source code on their public servers.

TransGaming offered a CVS tree for Cedega without the Point2Play GUI, copy protection support, and texture compression through its own repositories with mixed LGPL, AFPL and bstring licensing.

Scripts and guides have been made by the community to facilitate building Cedega from the source tree.

<doc id="704206" wikidata="Q1440128" url="?curid=704206" title="Henry Faulds">
<text>Henry Faulds (1 June 1843 – 24 March 1930) was a Scottish doctor, missionary and scientist who is noted for the development of fingerprinting.

==Early life==
Faulds was born in Beith, North Ayrshire, into a family of modest means. Aged 13, he was forced to leave school, and went to Glasgow to work as a clerk to help support his family; at 21 he decided to enrol at the Facility of Arts at Glasgow University, where he studied mathematics, logic and the classics. He later studied medicine at Anderson&#x27;s College, and graduated with a physician&#x27;s licence.

Following graduation, Faulds then became a medical missionary for the Church of Scotland. In 1871, he was sent to British India, where he worked for two years in Darjeeling at a hospital for the poor.

On 23 July 1873, he received a letter of appointment from the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to establish a medical mission in Japan. He married Isabella Wilson that September, and the newlyweds departed for Japan in December.

==Life in Japan==
Faulds established the first English speaking mission in Japan in 1874, with a hospital and a teaching facility for Japanese medical students. He helped introduce Joseph Lister&#x27;s antiseptic methods to Japanese surgeons. In 1875, he helped found the Rakuzenkai, Japan&#x27;s first society for the blind, and set up lifeguard stations to prevent drowning in nearby canals. He halted a rabies epidemic that killed small children who played with infected mice, and he helped stop the spread of cholera in Japan. He even cured a plague infecting the local fishmonger&#x27;s stock of carp. In 1880 he helped found a school for the blind. By 1882, his Tsukiji Hospital in Tokyo treated 15,000 patients annually. Faulds became fluent in Japanese, and in addition to his full-time work as a doctor, he wrote two books on travel in the Far East, many academic articles, and started three magazines.

Whilst accompanying a friend (American archaeologist, Edward S. Morse) to an archaeological dig he noticed how the delicate impressions left by craftsmen could be discerned in ancient clay fragments. Examining his own fingertips and those of friends, he became convinced that the pattern of ridges was unique to each individual.

Shortly after these observations his hospital was broken into. The local police arrested a member of staff whom Faulds believed to be innocent. Determined to exonerate the man, he compared the fingerprints left behind at the crime scene to those of the suspect and found them to be different. On the strength of this evidence the police agreed to release the suspect.

In an attempt to promote the idea of fingerprint identification he sought the help of the noted naturalist Charles Darwin. Darwin declined to work on the idea, but passed it on to his relative Francis Galton, who forwarded it to the Anthropological Society of London. When Galton returned to the topic some eight years later, he paid little attention to Faulds&#x27; letter. As a result of this interchange some controversy has arisen about the inventor of modern forensic fingerprinting. However, there can be no doubt that Faulds&#x27; first paper on the subject was published in the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1880; all parties conceded this.

The following month Sir William Herschel, a British civil servant based in India, wrote to &quot;Nature&quot; saying that he had been using fingerprints (as a form of bar code) to identify criminals since 1860. However, Herschel did not mention their potential for forensic use. Over the years, Faulds conducted a bitter controversy with Herschel over the use of fingerprints, demanding proof in 1894 that Herschel had ever used fingerprints officially, which Herschel duly provided, and then writing a series of books and pamphlets many years later containing variations of the argument that he had been cheated his due credit (see for complete facsimiles of these and other fundamental works on fingerprinting, and the Herschel/Faulds letters). These books were published from 1905 onward, long after fingerprinting had come into widespread use.

==Return to Britain==
Returning to Britain in 1886, after a quarrel with the missionary society which ran his hospital in Japan, Faulds offered the concept of fingerprint identification to Scotland Yard but he was dismissed, most likely because he did not present the extensive evidence required to show that prints are durable, unique and practically classifiable. Subsequently, Faulds returned to the life of a police surgeon, at first in London, and then in the Stoke-on-Trent town of Fenton. In 1922 he sold his practice and moved to James Street in nearby Wolstanton, where he died in March 1930 aged 86, bitter at the lack of recognition he had received for his work. In 2007 a plaque acknowledging Faulds&#x27; work was unveiled at Bank House, near to Wolstanton&#x27;s St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard where his grave can be seen. In 2011, a plaque was unveiled at his former James Street residence. On 12 November 2004 a memorial was dedicated to his memory in Beith town centre close to the site of the house in New Street where he was born.

==Legacy==
The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir William James Herschel in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by in 1880. Galton, following the idea written by Faulds, which he failed to credit, was the first to place the study on a scientific footing, which assisted its acceptance by the courts. The Japanese police officially adopted the fingerprinting system in 1911.

His clinic in Tokyo was bought by Ludolph Teusler and became St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital.

<doc id="704220" wikidata="Q1366283" url="?curid=704220" title="Robin Hull">
<text>Robin Hull (born 16 August 1974) is a Finnish former professional snooker player.

For some time, he was the sole Nordic player on the game&#x27;s main tour. He is known as a solid -builder, having compiled over 150 competitive during his career, among the highest for a player who has never featured in the top 16 in the world rankings.

Hull is one of six players to have missed the final black in attempting a maximum break, alongside Ken Doherty, Thepchaiya Un-Nooh (three times), Barry Pinches, Mark Selby and Liang Wenbo.

==Career==
Hull became a professional snooker player in 1992. In the 2001–02 season, he reached the last 16 of the 2001 UK Championship, and later qualified for the 2002 World Championship, knocking out Steve Davis in the final qualifying round; in the first round proper, he lost 6–10 to Graeme Dott. These results contributed to Hull entering the world top 32 at the end of the next season.

A potentially fatal viral infection kept Hull out of much of the 2003–04 season, although he still was able to reach his first ever quarter-final at the 2003 Welsh Open. He later repeated this result at the 2006 Malta Cup. However, his performances were largely inconsistent due to his health issues. He was forced to pull out of qualifying for the 2007 World Championship due to an irregular heartbeat thought to be linked to his past illness. After similar problems in the following season, he decided to retire from professional competition.

In February 2010 Hull took part in an invitation event the Finnish Challenge, which featured a number of notable professionals. He impressed, beating Darren Morgan, Ken Doherty and Matthew Stevens on the way to the final, where he lost 1–6 to Mark Williams. This result encouraged Hull to take part in the 2011 Q School tournament in an attempt to qualify for the 2011–12 main tour, which he did successfully in the first event. Due to lack of sponsorship he only played in a handful of events during the season with his best run coming in qualifying for the 2011 UK Championship in November where he beat Lucky Vatnani and Yu Delu, before losing to Peter Lines 4–6. Hull did not enter another tournament after this and finished the season ranked world number 84, outside of the top 64 who retain their places for the 2012–13 season and therefore did not retain his spot on the main tour. In the 2012–13 season Hull entered qualifying for the World Championship as an amateur, where he lost in the first round of preliminary qualifying 2–5 to Paul Wykes, despite making a 137 break during the match.

Hull regained his main tour place for the 2013–14 season by winning the EBSA European Snooker Championships in Zielona Góra, Poland, beating Welshman Gareth Allen 7–2 in the final, finishing the match with two consecutive centuries. He qualified for the 2013 International Championship by beating Liu Chuang 6–2, although he had to withdraw from the venue stages in China, and came close to beating the reigning world champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the last 64 of the minor-ranking Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup, losing 4–3 after leading 3–1. However, Hull failed to win any other match at the rest of the tournaments, and due to financial reasons skipped most of the second part of the season until the World Championship, where he delivered his best performances in years.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He scored an impressive 10–3 win against Tony Drago in the first round, followed by a 10–6 defeat of Tian Pengfei, and a 10–4 win from 3–0 behind against Ian Burns in round three, to set up a final round match against Peter Ebdon, which Hull won 10–8 to reach the Crucible for the second time in his career. He played O&#x27;Sullivan in the last 32 and lost 10–4, despite making a century in one of the frames.

The 2014–15 season began well for Hull. He defeated Xiao Guodong, Graeme Dott and Cao Yupeng to reach the quarter-finals (the third of his professional career and first for eight years) of the 2014 Wuxi Classic where he lost 5–2 to eventual runner-up Joe Perry.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hull won most of his opening round matches in the subsequent tournaments, but failed to progress beyond the last 64 stage until the 2015 China Open where he received a bye to the last 32 after Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s withdrawal, and defeated Mark King 5–4 to reach the last 16, where he lost 5–1 to Kurt Maflin.

Due to missing most of the previous season, Hull arrived at the season-ending World Championship qualifiers needing a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s performance to retain his tour card by getting into the top 64 of the world rankings. He did exactly that, as he beat Martin McCrudden, Ben Woollaston and Igor Figueiredo to qualify for the Crucible for the second year in a row. He was defeated 10–3 by Shaun Murphy in the first round, but was ranked 61st in the world afterwards.

Hull did not participate in many tournaments at the start of the 2015–16 season. His first win came at the 2015 UK Championship, where he defeated Zhang Anda 6–4 in the first round, followed by a 6–3 victory over world number eight Barry Hawkins. He was defeated in the third round 6–2 by Luca Brecel, his efforts earning him £9,000. At the Shoot-Out, the tournament in which every match is decided by a single 10-minute frame, Hull won his second professional title by beating Brecel in the final. The winner&#x27;s prize of £32,000 is the highest pay day of his career.

His Shoot-Out success allowed him to compete in the 2016 Champion of Champions, where he lost 4–2 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round. His only last 16 appearance this year came at the German Masters after he followed qualifying wins over Luca Brecel and Matthew Stevens with a 5–4 victory over Jimmy White, before losing 5–4 to Ryan Day. In the first round of World Championship qualifying, Hull suffered a huge 10–8 shock defeat to 11-time ladies world champion Reanne Evans.

==Personal life==

Hull was born and raised in Finland, to a Finnish mother and an English father.
