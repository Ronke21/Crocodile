<text>Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley (09 September 1567 – 23 June 1643) was an English peer, politician, and landowner. He briefly served in the House of Commons. Sutton became widely known for his intemperate behaviour, which ultimately led to the financial ruin of his family. He was the last of his lineage to hold the title of Baron Dudley.

==Background and early life==
Sutton&#x27;s father was Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley, a distinguished soldier who managed to regain the family estates after they were forfeited to John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, due to debt. His mother was Jane Stanley, the second wife of the 4th Baron and the daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. He had a younger brother, John, and an elder half-sister, Agnes, from his father&#x27;s first marriage.

Edward Sutton is believed to have been born in September 1567 as he was baptised on 17 September 1567. At the age of 13, in 1580, he was sent to Lincoln College, Oxford, to further his education. The following year, when he was just 14 years old, he married Theodosia Harington of Exton, Rutland who was about 5 years older.

==Lord Dudley&#x27;s players==
Sutton was the patron of a group of actors, known as Lord Dudley&#x27;s players, and a performing bear. In 1595 he drew up a warrant for his company led by Francis Coffyn and Laurence Bradshaw to travel and perform. Sutton revoked this license and patronised a different group of actors, but some actors tried unsuccessfully to use the cancelled 1595 warrant in Chester in November 1602.

Lord Dudley&#x27;s players were in Newcastle in March 1600. In 1615 the leader of the company was called Dishley.

==Political career==

Edward Sutton was elected as one of the two knights of the shire for Staffordshire in 1584. Still only 17 years old, he was returned ahead in order of precedence of Edward Legh. It is not clear how this was achieved. Legh was made High Sheriff of Staffordshire on the day of the election and had to be given leave of absence by Parliament. Sutton made no recorded contributions in the Commons. He succeeded his father in 1586 and so was unable to stand for election that year. Despite his apparent anxiety to serve in the councils of his country, Sutton did not take his seat in the House of Lords until 1593.

Sutton&#x27;s most important political intervention came through the Staffordshire election scandal of 1597. Pursuing a property dispute with the Worcestershire Lytteltons, Sutton put up his brother John as a candidate, in an attempt to stop the election of Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall, a close ally of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Sutton ensured success by procuring a blank election return from Thomas Whorwood, the High Sheriff, who was John Sutton&#x27;s father-in-law. Littleton, cheated of certain victory, filed bills against the Suttons and Whorwood in Star Chamber. 

Among his complaints against Lord Dudley was that he had personally voted for his brother in the voice vote at Stafford. As a peer, Sutton should have no part in elections to the Commons, Littleton maintained, apparently the first time this constitutional principle was expressed. The other candidate, Sir Christopher Blount, Essex&#x27;s stepfather, was also offended at having been placed below Sutton on the election indenture. His wife, Essex&#x27;s mother, wrote to the Earl complaining about the outrage, and Sutton was summoned before the Privy Council. 

However, the parliament was soon over, and it appears that Littleton chose to concentrate his efforts on the hapless Whorwood. Although his chicanery and bad manners had alienated some of the greatest in the land, the consequences for Sutton might have been worse.

==Landowner and industrialist==
Edward Sutton spent most of his life pressured by the authorities to meet debts that were beyond his ability to pay, partly inherited from his father, and partly the result of his own poor management of his resources.

Lord Dudley, like his immediate ancestors, owned substantial estates around Dudley Castle including the manors of Dudley, Sedgley and Kingswinford. He developed the mineral resources of these estates, building (probably) five blast furnaces on them. He obtained a licence to use the patent of John Robinson (or Rovenson) for making iron with pitcoal (that is, mineral coal) in 1619, and in 1622 renewed this patent in his own name. Sutton was said to be an innovator who set up an early reverberatory furnace using coal and a glassworks directed by Paul Tissac, or Tyzack, where coal rather than wood was first used as fuel. These projects brought him no profit.

Edward Sutton brought his illegitimate son Dud Dudley home from Balliol College, Oxford to manage his ironworks, but this strategy was not entirely successful. Ultimately Edward Sutton fell out with Dud and expelled Dud from the new coke-fired blast furnace that Edward had built at Hasco Bridge on the boundary between Gornal and Himley. Debts continued to grow, and by 1593 the estate had been sequestrated.

The ironworks were essential because the family&#x27;s debts were already so large that Lord Edward&#x27;s father&#x27;s will had earmarked all the proceeds of his ironworks for 21 years to pay creditors, who were given precedence over his widow and younger children. Money issues soured relations with John, Edward Sutton&#x27;s younger brother. 

John had been compensated for his exclusion from a portion of his father&#x27;s estate by the promise of an annuity from his brother, which Edward never paid. The electoral fraud of 1597 might have helped John establish new contacts and income streams, but the parliament lasted little more than three months and the scandal made any further parliamentary career impossible for him.

Always short of money, Edward Sutton fought numerous battles to maintain his inheritance and income, many of them through violence. His most bitter feud was with Gilbert Lyttelton, centred on the farm of Prestwood, near Kinver, and reached its height in the 1590s. Prestwood is at the confluence of the River Smestow and the Worcestershire Stour. 

Sutton had Lyttelton ejected by force. He then claimed the right to seize outlaws&#x27; goods on other Lyttelton estates and raided them, driving off the sheep and cattle. Extending the dispute still further, he claimed one of Lyttelton&#x27;s coal mines. He had the miners arrested, confiscated the stocks of coal and set the mine on fire. The Privy Council summoned Lord Dudley and tried to reason with him, to no effect. Lyttelton complained to the Star Chamber, which found in his favour, fining Sutton heavily for rioting and cattle rustling. It was this that led Sutton to attempt revenge by blocking Edward Littleton&#x27;s election, as he was a distant kinsman of Gilbert Lyttelton. 

Feelings were very bitter on both sides. The Privy Council had to write to the Worcestershire assizes in July 1598, demanding action against two of Gilbert Lyttelton&#x27;s sons, Stephen and John, who had attacked John Sutton and his retainers, although the Suttons had already lost the property dispute.

==Marriage and family==
Dudley was married at the age of 14 to Theodosia Harington (d. 1649). She was the daughter of James Harington of Exton, Rutland, a lawyer and long-serving MP. The Haringtons were the most important landowners in Rutland and Theodosia&#x27;s eldest brother, John, was created Baron Harington of Exton in 1603. Dudley and Theodosia had a son and four daughters:

:*Sir Ferdinando Sutton (1588-1621), who married Honora Seymour, a daughter of Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, who was considered by some a potential claimant to the throne on the death of Elizabeth I.

:*Mary Sutton (1586–1645), who married Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home.

:*Anne Sutton (1589-1615), who married Hans Meinhard von Schönberg, the Palatine Ambassador to England: their son was Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg.

:*Margaret Sutton (1597-1674), who in 1627 married Sir Miles Hobart, Knight of the Bath, of Fleet Street in the City of London and of Little Plumstead in Norfolk, a son of Henry Hobart of Plumstead by his wife Willoughby Hopton, a daughter of Arthur Hopton of Blythburgh and Witham. They had sons Edward, Miles, Tom, John and James, and a daughter Willoughby. She was buried at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

:*Theodosia Sutton (1599-1615).

Lord Dudley also had a longtime mistress Elizabeth Tomlinson, who bore him a large family of illegitimate children, at least 11 in number. Lord Dudley provided for this second family. The eldest Robert Dudley otherwise Tomlinson was given a small estate at Netherton in Dudley. Another son Dud Dudley was given a lease of Chasepool Lodge in Swindon, Staffordshire. A daughter Jane was grandmother to ironmaster Abraham Darby I. A John Dudley who features in the diary of Lady Anne Clifford may have been a son of Elizabeth Tomlinson.

At the Star Chamber, Gilbert Lyttelton attempted to discredit Dudley by claiming that he had abandoned his wife in London without support to live with Elizabeth Tomlinson, &quot;a lewd and infamous woman, a base collier&#x27;s daughter&quot;. The Privy Council ordered Dudley to pay his wife an allowance, which he failed to do. In August 1597 he was sent to Fleet Prison. He was released after a few days, on condition that he pay maintenance of £100 annually for his wife, and £20 for each legitimate child. In less than 18 months he was back before the Privy Council, having got into arrears.

Dudley&#x27;s legitimate son, Ferdinando, predeceased him, leaving a daughter Frances. Dudley married this granddaughter to Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy goldsmith, William Ward, who was one of his creditors.

Dudley died on 23 June 1643 and was buried in St Edmund&#x27;s Church, Dudley. Frances Ward inherited the estates, with their debts, and became Baroness Dudley suo jure. Humble Ward paid the debts and redeemed the estates for the benefit of themselves and their descendants.

<doc id="719004" wikidata="Q460854" url="?curid=719004" title="California State Route 14">
<text>State Route 14 (SR 14) is a north–south state highway in the U.S. state of California that connects Los Angeles to the northern Mojave Desert. The southern portion of the highway is signed as the Antelope Valley Freeway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5, Golden State Freeway) in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Granada Hills and Sylmar just immediately to the south of the border of the city of Santa Clarita. SR 14&#x27;s northern terminus is at U.S. Route 395 (US 395) near Inyokern. Legislatively, the route extends south of I-5 to SR 1 in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles; however, the portion south of the junction with I-5 has not been constructed. The southern part of the constructed route is a busy commuter freeway serving and connecting the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale, and Lancaster to the rest of the Greater Los Angeles area. The northern portion, from Vincent (south of Palmdale) to US 395, is legislatively named the Aerospace Highway, as the highway serves Edwards Air Force Base, once one of the primary landing strips for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle, as well as the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake that supports military aerospace research, development and testing. This section is rural, following the line between the hot Mojave desert and the forming Sierra Nevada mountain range. Most of SR 14 is loosely paralleled by a rail line originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad, and was once the primary rail link between Los Angeles and Northern California. While no longer a primary rail line, the southern half of this line is now used for the Antelope Valley Line of the Metrolink commuter rail system.

Linked with US 395, this road also connects Los Angeles with such places as Mammoth Mountain, Mono Lake, Yosemite National Park and Reno, Nevada. SR 14 was part of US 6 prior to truncation in 1964, when US 6 was a coast-to-coast route from Long Beach to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The non-freeway segment of SR 14 from Silver Queen Road north of Rosamond to Mojave is known as Sierra Highway, as is the old routing between I-5 and Silver Queen Road where SR 14 has been moved to a newer freeway alignment. Portions of SR 14 remain signed with names associated with US 6, including Midland Trail, Theodore Roosevelt Highway, and Grand Army of the Republic Highway.

==Route description==
SR 14 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

===Antelope Valley Freeway===
The southern portion of the freeway, from I-5 to the Avenue D exit near Lancaster, has been designated the Antelope Valley Freeway by the state legislature. The Antelope Valley Freeway begins in the Santa Susana Mountains at the Newhall Pass interchange by splitting from the Golden State Freeway (I-5). This is the busiest portion of the route with an annual average daily traffic (AADT) count of 169,000 vehicles per day. The freeway forms much of the eastern boundary of Santa Clarita along its route. Past Santa Clarita, the road continues northeast and crosses the Sierra Pelona Mountains and western San Gabriel Mountains via the canyon of the seasonal Santa Clara River. The ascent is mostly rugged and rural terrain, with only two small towns along the ascent, first Agua Dulce and later Acton. In Agua Dulce, the freeway forms the southern boundary of Vasquez Rocks Park, a county park. The highway crests the Sierra Pelona Mountains via Escondido Summit, at an elevation of , before descending and passing by Acton to the north. The highway then crests the San Gabriel Mountains via Soledad Pass, at an elevation of . The route of the highway through the mountains loosely parallels that of the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line.

After cresting both mountain passes, the highway descends into the Antelope Valley, a large valley within the Mojave Desert. The highway crosses Angeles Forest Highway and the California Aqueduct in the descent. SR 14 serves as the primary north–south thoroughfare for the communities of Palmdale and Lancaster. Between Palmdale Boulevard (County Route N2) and Avenue D in Lancaster, SR 14 runs concurrently with SR 138.

===Aerospace Highway===
From the Pearblossom Highway exit south of Palmdale to its northern terminus at US 395 near Inyokern, SR 14 has been designated the Aerospace Highway. Between Pearblossom Highway and Avenue S, there is a vista point overlooking Lake Palmdale, which features a historic plaque that honors aviation accomplishments including the Space Shuttle, breaking the sound barrier and the speed record. The freeway passes the Los Angeles–Kern county line at Avenue A, and continues to run north through Rosamond and Mojave. In Rosamond, the highway passes close to Edwards Air Force Base, which was often used as one of the main landing strips for NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle, and as the base for the X-15 and many other air and spacecraft.

The freeway portion terminates just south of Mojave, where SR 14 serves as the main street and runs through the downtown area. To the east of the route is Mojave Air &amp; Space Port, home to the National Test Pilot School and SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded human spaceflight, as well as a vast airplane graveyard; all are visible from SR 14.
SR 58 was formerly routed concurrently with SR 14 through Mojave, before it was rerouted onto a bypass running north and east of the town.

The character of the highway changes as it leaves California City with the last interchange located at California City Boulevard. Now a divided highway with at-grade intersections, departs the corridor of the rail main, to follow the crest of the forming Sierra Nevada mountains. The route continues to follow a branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad used as a connector for the Trona Railway. The main line of the railroad proceeds towards the Central Valley via Tehachapi Pass. Though SR 14 heads away from the pass, the highway has views of the mountains and the Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm. The scenery also changes, as the highway departs the Mojave Desert and crosses Red Rock Canyon State Park. Traffic counts drop dramatically as the highway becomes more rural, with an AADT of 3,200 vehicles at the northern terminus. SR 14 continues north toward US 395 in Inyokern, much of its routing as an expressway. Towards its northern terminus, SR 14 runs briefly concurrently with SR 178. At its northern terminus, SR 14 merges with US 395 as it turns into an expressway heading north to Bishop. As US 395 the route continues to follow the crest of the Sierra Nevada, serving Owens Valley, Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake.

==History==

===Trails===

The first road to use the general alignment of modern SR 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. A dirt road was completed in the 1910s from what had been a pack trail. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved.

During the late 19th century, the corridor of modern SR 14 was also in use by the Southern Pacific Railroad. South of Mojave was used for a main line, the corridor north of Mojave follows a branch line. The main line connected Los Angeles with the Central Valley, via Soledad Pass and Tehachapi Pass. While significantly longer than the more direct Ridge Route (east of modern I-5), Tehachapi Pass is lower than Tejon Pass along the Ridge Route, with a longer, less steep grade on the descent into the Central Valley. While the Tehachapi Pass portion of this line has remained the same, over time another route was built from Mojave, across the Antelope Valley towards Cajon Pass to cross the San Gabriel Mountains, there merging with another main rail trunk to Los Angeles. The Cajon Pass fork remains the primary freight rail line to connect southern and northern California in use today, now owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The fork paralleling SR 14 and crossing at Soledad Pass is still a contiguous line, but not used for through freight traffic as a significant portion was sold to the predecessors of the Southern California Regional Rail Authority to become the Antelope Valley Line of the Metrolink commuter rail service. The branch north of Mojave was built when the Southern Pacific acquired the unfinished Carson and Colorado Railroad in 1900. The Southern Pacific built a standard gauge connector to the narrow gauge Carson and Colorado line from their main at Mojave. Although plans were to eventually convert this acquired line to standard gauge, most of the line was abandoned before the conversion was complete. The southern portion of this line is still active and connects to the Trona Railway.

The Midland Trail was one of the first organized coast-to-coast trails in the United States. In the trail&#x27;s infancy, its routing changed numerous times. By 1925, the Midland Trail was established along what is modern State Route 168, joining El Camino Sierra in Big Pine. Other named trails that eventually followed this route included the Theodore Roosevelt highway, and Grand Army of the Republic Highway. Parts of modern SR 14 continue to be signed with these names, and north of Los Angeles County is still officially designated &quot;El Camino Sierra / Midland Trail&quot; as well as the aforementioned &quot;Aerospace Highway&quot;.

===U.S. Route 6===
US 6 was extended from Greeley, Colorado, to Long Beach, California, on June 21, 1937. Most of this extension used the Midland Trail, although the route entered California from Nevada slightly north of the previous route of the Midland Trail, instead passing through Bishop. While being designated US 6, parts of modern SR 14 were upgraded to freeway standards.

As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering, US 6 was truncated at Bishop. The portion of US 6 from Inyokern to Los Angeles was designated SR 14. Previously, the SR 14 designation was used for Artesia Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue, in the Los Angeles area, a portion of modern SR 91.

Between 1963 and 1975, significant portions of US 6/SR 14 were moved to a freeway alignment. The former routing south of Mojave (and the current routing to the north) is still known as Sierra Highway. The first freeway section, from just east of Solemint Junction to Red Rover Mine Road, was completed in 1963. Further portions in the intercanyon areas of Acton to Soledad Pass were completed by 1965. By 1966, the freeway was complete as far north as Avenue P-8 (now Technology Drive) in Palmdale. The freeway was completed to Mojave by 1972.

===Incidents===
The Newhall Pass interchange, where I-5, Sierra Highway, Foothill Boulevard, San Fernando Road and the southern terminus of SR 14 meet, has been the site of a number of catastrophic incidents. The interchange has partially collapsed twice due to earthquakes: the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As a result of the 1994 collapse, this interchange was renamed the &quot;Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange&quot;, honoring a Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer killed when he was unable to stop in time and drove off the collapsed flyover ramp from SR 14 south to I-5 south. After both earthquakes, the collapsed portions were rebuilt and surviving portions reinforced.

In 2007, two tractor-trailer trucks collided in a tunnel along the truck lanes for southbound I-5 at the interchange. A resulting fire started, soon encompassing the entire tunnel along with 30 other trucks and one passenger vehicle that were in the tunnel at the time. The truck tunnel was closed for several days for structural damage inspections and repairs.

===Cancelled plans===

SR 14 is an unfinished route, as the definition in the California &quot;Streets and Highways Code&quot; states that the route begins at SR 1 (Pacific Coast Highway), near Sunset Boulevard in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Between the constructed end and legislative end of SR 14 are the community of Reseda and Topanga State Park. There is no paved road that directly connects these two points, with SR 27 or I-405 being the nearest through roads in this area.

The interchange with Sierra Highway at Via Princessa in Santa Clarita has an unusual design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. This is the result of a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita that canceled plans for a freeway extension of SR 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of SR 126 was canceled, the city of Santa Clarita constructed the Cross Valley Connector (CVC) to connect SR 126 directly to SR 14 via Newhall Ranch Road and Golden Valley Road. The final CVC section, the bridge over the Santa Clara River, was opened on March 27, 2010.

==Future==
Rapid exurban growth in Santa Clarita, Lancaster, and Palmdale has made the Antelope Valley Freeway one of the most congested in southern California, with average rush hour speeds well below . Future predictions call for continued growth along the SR 14 corridor, including predictions of a tripling of the population of Palmdale by 2030. In response, multiple government agencies have proposed adding more transportation arteries between Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley, as well as expanding the capacity of the existing SR 14 and rail corridors.

Several proposals have been made to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of SR 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.

<text>Sir James South (October 1785 – 19 October 1867) was a British astronomer.

He was a joint founder of the Astronomical Society of London, and it was under his name, as President of the Society in 1831, that a petition was successfully submitted to obtain a Royal Charter, whereupon it became the Royal Astronomical Society.

==Life==

He was born in Southwark in London in October 1785, the son of James South, a pharmaceutical chemist. John Flint South was his younger half-brother. He originally trained as a chemist, then as a surgeon, but his interests in astronomy overtook all things.

In 1821 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1822 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Edward Troughton.

He won the Copley Medal in 1826 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in that same year.

He was knighted by King William IV in 1831.

Starting around 1826, James South made plans for a new, larger telescope, an equatorially mounted achromatic refractor (a telescope with a lens) in a new observatory. He bought a 12-inch (actually about 11.8) aperture lens from Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix in Paris for about 1000 pounds, large enough to be the biggest achromatic object lens in the world at the time. The telescope for the lens was completed, but dismantled around 1838. The next largest refractor, was at the Markree Observatory, which successfully completed a 13.3-inch refractor (also a Cauchoix of Paris lens) in the 1830s on a Thomas Grubb mount. The problem for James South&#x27;s telescope was the equatorial mount.

South was involved in a notorious lawsuit brought against him by the instrument maker Edward Troughton over this equatorial-mount telescope which the latter had constructed for him, and which South considered defective. Troughton sued him for payment and won. South promptly demolished the telescope mount; the 12-inch lens, which had been purchased separately, was preserved and presented to the (Dublin) Dunsink Observatory in 1862. The Observatory mounted it on a Grubb equatorial, where it survives to the present day. (See also Great refractors)

James was the second owner of the Groombridge Transit Circle of 1806 (after Stephen Groombridge).

He died at the observatory on Campden Hill in Kensington on 19 October 1867, and was buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.

==Family==

In 1816 he married Charlotte Ellis (d.1851). She was an heiress and his new-found wealth enabled him to give up surgery and concentrate on astronomy.

==Works==

South and John Herschel jointly produced a catalogue of 380 double stars in 1824, reobserving many of the double stars that had been discovered by William Herschel. South then continued and observed another 458 double stars over the following year.

==Recognition==

Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour.

<doc id="719007" wikidata="Q75790" url="?curid=719007" title="Karl Löwith">
<text>Karl Löwith (9 January 1897 – 26 May 1973) was a German philosopher in the phenomenological tradition. A student of Husserl and Heidegger, he was one of the most prolific German philosophers of the twentieth century.

He is known for his two books &quot;From Hegel to Nietzsche&quot;, which describes the decline of German classical philosophy, and &quot;Meaning in History&quot;, which challenges the modern, secular progressive narrative of history, which seeks to ground the meaning of history in itself.

==Life==
Löwith was born in Munich to a Christian family of Jewish descent. He was trained in phenomenology under Heidegger, and they developed a close friendship. However this relationship became estranged with Heidegger&#x27;s affiliation with Nazism, therefore Löwith had to emigrate from Germany in 1934 because of the Nazi regime. He was an important witness in 1936 to Heidegger&#x27;s continuing allegiance to Nazism. He went to Italy and in 1936 he went to Japan (as did figures like Emil Brunner [1889-1966]) where he lectured at Tohoku University, which had its own tradition of phenomenology. But because of the alliance between the Third Reich and Japan he had to leave Japan in 1941 and went to the United States. From 1941 to 1952, he taught at the Hartford Theological Seminary and The New School for Social Research. In 1952 he returned to Germany to teach as professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, where he died.

== Thought== 

His main influences include Heidegger, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard. His writing after WWII can be read in the same vein as other Christian philosophers and theologians of the 20th century. Often called responses to &quot;crisis&quot;, Christian intellectuals of this era, such as Karl Barth (Protestant), Florovsky (Orthodox), and Erich Przywara (Roman Catholic), attempted to articulate an understanding of Christian faith in response to the challenges of scientism, secularism, and skepticism.

===&quot;From Hegel to Nietzsche&quot;===
===&quot;Meaning in History&quot;===
Löwith&#x27;s argument in &quot;Meaning in History&quot; is that the western view of history is confused by the relationship between Christian faith and the modern view, which is neither Christian nor pagan. He writes,&quot; The modern mind has not made up its mind whether it should be Christian or pagan, it sees with one eye of faith and one of reason. Hence its vision is necessarily dim in comparison with either Greek or biblical thinking.&quot; The modern view is progressive, which is to say that it believes that the trajectory of history is moving towards a fulfillment in the bettering of the world by rational and technological means. Löwith believes that the modern view is a sort of Christian &quot;heresy&quot; insofar that this depends on the theology that history has a linear movement, in contrast to Greek pagan cyclical view of history. In this critique Löwith is prophetic in the sense that he anticipates the way post-secular theologians will pick up a similar critique of modernity in the 1990s (such is the case in the Radical Orthodox movement). The modern historical consciousness is, according to Löwith, derived from Christianity. But, this is mistaken because Christians are not a historical people, as their view of the world is based on faith. This explains the tendency in history (and philosophy) to see an eschatological view of human progress. Löwith traces the &quot;regression&quot; of history as opposed to a progression through famous western philosophers and historians. Whereas most genealogies begin from the most antique to the modern, Löwith begins with the most current. He moves from Burckhardt, to Marx, to Hegel, Voltaire, Vico, Bossuet, Augustine, Orosius, and others. He argues that the closer we get to the Biblical vision of history, &quot; I cannot discover the slightest hint of a &quot;philosophy of history&quot;. By this he means that a truly theological view of history is not movement to an immanent end, but a transcendent eschatological hope in the consummation of the world. It is not a &quot;philosophy&quot; or attempt to systematize the movement of history. This point is clear in the epilogue of &quot;Meaning in History&quot; where he says, &quot;The attempt at elucidation of the dependence of the philosophy of history on the eschatological history of fulfillment and salvation does not solve the problem of historical thinking.&quot; Here he seems to argue that like the progressive view any theological view that tries to equate the happenings of history with God&#x27;s action is inadequate, which reveals his true argument: We cannot understand the happening of history by reason.

Returning to the idea that Löwith, like Barth, and others was trying to rethink Christian faith in light of the crisis of world war, Lowith&#x27;s real concern is the relationship between faith and reason or more specifically faith and history. He writes, &quot;The Christian hope is not a worldly desire and expectation that something will probably happen but a cast of mind based on an unconditional faith in God&#x27;s redemptive purpose. Genuine hope is, therefore, as free and absolute as the act of faith itself. Both hope and faith are Christian virtues of Grace. The reasons for such an unconditional hope and faith cannot rest on rational calculation of their reasonableness. Hence hope can never be refuted by so-called facts; it can neither be assured nor discredited by an established experience.&quot; His analysis of the relationship between faith and the observable events of history is one of absolute disconnect, which is an idea he seems to adopt from Kierkegaard&#x27;s similar argument in &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;. Lowith&#x27;s answer to the change of modernity is to say that Christianity has nothing at all to do with history or reason, rather it is about being given faith, which becomes hope in the God-man. He writes, &quot;The question is therefore not the justification of absolute hope and faith by their relative reasonableness, but whether such an unconditional hope and faith can be put into man instead of God and the God-man. Hope is justified only by faith which justifies itself.&quot;

So, whereas the &quot;liberal&quot; Christianity of his contemporaries tried to accommodate or assimilate faith with reason, Löwith maintains that faith justifies itself.

<doc id="719015" wikidata="Q467261" url="?curid=719015" title="Gennadi Gagulia">
<text>Gennadi Leonidipa Gagulia (, ; 3 January 1947 – 8 September 2018) was an Abkhazian politician who was three-time prime minister of Abkhazia and the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He served as the first prime minister of Abkhazia after the post was established by the constitution in 1995, holding it until 1997. He returned to the post in 2002 and remained for several months into 2003, and held it for a final time in 2018 until he was killed in a car crash.

==Early life and career==
Gagulia was born on 3 January 1947 in the Gudauta District of the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of the Belarusian Polytechnic Institute in 1972 and worked at Stroymaster as the chief engineer and the head of the construction site from 1973 to 1977. He spent the following 15 years as a deputy director of Catering at Lake Rizal and as Chairman of the Gudauta district consumer cooperatives.

==Political career==
In the year after the Republic of Abkhazia was founded, he worked at the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations of the Council of Ministers of the republic, before eventually serving as deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia from 1992 to 1995. During the Georgian-Abkhaz War, Gagulia was a member of the Abkhazian Defense Committee, which was responsible for the distribution of food for the Abkhaz Armed Forces.

===First Term as Prime Minister (1995–1997)===
Gagulia became the first Prime Minister of Abkhazia in 1995 following the adoption of the 1994 Constitution of Abkhazia. As prime minister Gagulia had a reputation for being the most pro-Russian of Abkhazia&#x27;s prime ministers. He steadfastly opposed both reunification with Georgia and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Georgian-Abkhaz border. He also alluded to the possibility of Abkhazia unifying with Russia. While in this role, he met with a number of foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1997, Gagulia resigned from the prime ministership, citing health reasons.

=== Career (1997–2002) ===
In between his first two terms as prime minister, Gagulia served as the chair of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Abkhazia. He was also deputy prime minister under Anri Jergenia.

=== Second Term as Prime Minister (2002–2003) ===
When Jergenia was fired on 29 November 2002, Gagulia was appointed as prime minister for the second time. He only served for only 5 months until Gagulia&#x27;s government filed for resignation on 7 April 2003. Earlier that day, nine Abkhazian prisoners had escaped, four of which had been sentenced to death due to their involvement in the 2001 Kodori crisis. President Ardzinba initially refused to accept Gagulia&#x27;s resignation, but was forced to agree on 8 April. Vice President Valery Arshba denied on 8 April that the government&#x27;s resignation was due to the prison escape, and stated that instead it was caused by the opposition&#x27;s plans to hold protest rallies on 10 April.

=== Career after his Second Term (2003–2018) ===
On 15 December 2003, Gagulia was appointed head of the Presidential administration, succeeding Miron Agrba. On 18 June 2004, Gagulia resigned from his post, stating &quot;There is a certain scenario to the presidential elections in Abkhazia. I don&#x27;t match this scenario and thus I prefer to step down.&quot;

It had been suggested that Ardzinba may have also favoured Gagulia to replace him as president, but Ardzinba instead decided to back then-Prime Minister Raul Khajimba.

On 24 June 2004, Gagulia was again appointed head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Abkhazia, succeeding Yuri Aqaba. Gagulia remained in that position until April 2018.

===Third Term as Prime Minister (2018)===
Gagulia was reappointed Prime Minister of Abkhazia in April 2018 by President Raul Khajimba, replacing Beslan Bartsits.

==Death==
Gagulia was killed in a car accident outside the village of Miusera, Gudauta District on 8 September 2018. He was returning from Sochi International Airport following a 3-day visit with Khajimba to Syria. A car collided with the convoy, and the impact forced Gagulia&#x27;s car into the ditch. The car was driven by a 22-year-old Abkhaz man, who was, according to local authorities, &quot;under the influence of narcotics&quot;. He died on the spot.

Khajimba, who was travelling in the same convoy and witnessed the crash, suggested it was not an assassination attempt or terrorism, but rather an accident.

<text>Johann Heinrich Blasius (7 October 1809 – 26 May 1870) was a German zoologist. His sons, Rudolf Heinrich Paul Blasius (1842-1907) and August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius (1845–1912) were ornithologists.

== Biography ==
In 1836, he was appointed as a professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig. In 1840, he founded the Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universität Braunschweig. In 1859 he was appointed as the director of the newly founded Naturhistorisches Museum (Braunschweig) and in 1866 also of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum.

== Writings ==
He was the author of two major books on vertebrates: &quot;&quot;Fauna der Wirbelthiere Deutschlands&quot; (1857), and &quot;Die wirbelthiere Europa&#x27;s&quot; (Vertebrates of Europe, with Alexander Keyserling, 1840). He also wrote &quot;Reise im Europäischen Russland in den Jahren 1840 und 1851&quot;&quot; (Journey to European Russia in the years 1840 &amp; 1851). In 1862 ornithologist Alfred Newton (1829–1907) published &quot;A list of the birds of Europe&quot;, a translation based on Blasius&#x27; research.

Blasius was also an early contemporary critic of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;:

:I have also seldom read a scientific book which makes such wide-ranging conclusions with so few facts supporting them. … Darwin wants to show that kinds come from other kinds [German &quot;Arten&quot;]. I regard this as somewhat of a highhanded hypothesis, because he argues using unproven possibilities, without even naming a single example of the origin of a particular species. …
:Zoologists who engage in empirical research would generally regard as valid only that which can be observed in an experiment or in free-living nature. And what one observes there is that the offspring of a plant or animal inevitably resembles the parents, i.e. they belong to the same kind. The immovability of the boundaries of the kinds is, for most of us, a law of nature.

<doc id="719034" wikidata="Q2418665" url="?curid=719034" title="Mephisto (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Mephisto is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #3 (December 1968), and was created by Stan Lee and John Buscema and based on Mephistopheles: a demon character from the Faust legend, who has sometimes been referred to as Mephisto. Introduced as a recurring adversary of the Silver Surfer and Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze), Mephisto has also endured as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most prominent adversaries, being responsible for Norman and Harry Osborn&#x27;s respective transformations into the Green Goblin and Kindred; and for the superhero&#x27;s loss of his marriage to Mary Jane Watson, considering their future daughter Spider-Girl his archenemy. The father of Blackheart, Jezebel, and Father Priest, Mephisto has often come into conflict with Doctor Strange, Doctor Doom, Scarlet Witch and other heroes of the Marvel Universe, being responsible both for the creation of the Cosmic Ghost Rider and the descents of the Osborns, Phil Coulson, and Otto Octavius into villainy.

Debuting in the Silver Age of comic books, the character has appeared in over five decades of Marvel continuity. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise, including animated television series, feature film, toys, trading cards, and video games.

Mephisto has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful supervillains.

Peter Fonda played the character in the 2007 film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, Ciaran Hinds played him in its 2012 sequel &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;, and Keith David played him in the 2024 second season of &quot;Hit-Monkey&quot;.

==Publication history==
Inspired by Mephistopheles of the Faust legend, he was introduced into Marvel comics by writer Stan Lee and penciler John Buscema, Mephisto debuted in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #3 (cover dated Dec. 1968), and was established as a perennial foe for the cosmic hero, also appearing in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #8–9 (Sept.–Oct. 1969) and 16–17 (May–June 1970).

Author Mike Conroy has described Mephisto as &quot;the tempter who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer&#x27;s off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee&#x27;s heroes, the Surfer&#x27;s goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set.&quot;

Mephisto went on to become a foe for the Norse god Thor in &quot;Thor&quot; #180–181 (Sept.–Oct. 1970), &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #8 (Oct. 1971) and &quot;Thor&quot; #204–205 (Oct.–Nov. 1972). He was later revealed to be the being to whom Johnny Blaze had sold his soul to and thus had been cursed to become the Ghost Rider, in a retcon that placed him in the role originally played by Satan. This was later retconned back to Satan, though Mephisto&#x27;s influence is still felt in the 1990s by the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider.

Other appearances included posing as Satan in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #5 (Aug. 1972); tormenting the titular superhero team in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #155–157 (Feb.–April 1975) and &quot;Thor&quot; #310 (Aug. 1981) and 325 (Nov. 1982). Mephisto also guest-starred in two miniseries: &quot;The Vision and the Scarlet Witch&quot; (vol. 2) #1–12 (Oct. 1985–Sept. 1986) and &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; #1-9 (July 1985 – March 1986), before starring in the self-titled miniseries &quot;Mephisto vs.&quot; #1–4 (April–July 1987), battling four of Marvel&#x27;s super-teams. The miniseries was penciled by co-creator Buscema.

In &quot;Daredevil&quot; #266 (May 1989), penciler John Romita, Jr. redesigned the character, reimagining him as a bloated, naked creature with short, vaguely frog-like legs and a demonic-looking head. Romita explained &quot;I couldn&#x27;t see the Devil with tights and a cape.&quot; Subsequent portrayals have varied between Mephisto&#x27;s original appearance and the Romita redesign.

Mephisto continued to torment the Scarlet Witch in &quot;Avengers West Coast&quot; #51–52 (Nov.–Dec. 1989); created a new adversary for the Marvel heroes in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #270 (Sept. 1989); and appeared in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; No. 49 &quot;Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment&quot; (1989). Additionally, he was featured prominently in the &quot;One More Day&quot; story line in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #544; &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; #24; &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 2) #41 and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #545 (Oct. 2007–Jan. 2008), rising to becoming the ultimate adversary of Spider-Man, making deals with Peter Parker, Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, and Miles Morales.

In 2009, Mephisto was ranked #48 on IGN&#x27;s list of Greatest Comic Book Villains of All Time.

==Fictional character biography==
===Introduction (1960s–1970s)===
Mephisto is a perennial villain in the Marvel Universe, and is responsible for a number of evil acts, including capturing and holding the soul of Cynthia von Doom – the mother of Doctor Doom — until Doctor Strange and Doom freed her so she could ascend into Heaven. He was jealous of the worship of the fire demon Zarathos, so, posing as Satan, Mephisto creates the Ghost Rider by bonding Zarathos to Johnny Blaze. Mephisto refers to his domain as Hell. In one story where he battled Thor, he was shown to have various historical villains in his realm, such as Adolf Hitler, Blackbeard, and Attila the Hun.

Mephisto claims to have been created, along with many other demons, by the supreme being whose suicide resulted in the creation of the Marvel Universe, as well as the Infinity Gems. He also claimed that his totally evil nature is because the supreme being did not choose to make him good, as that being had no concept of it. He witnessed the Celestial known as the Progenitor succumbing to the Horde on Earth, with Mephisto, still young in the form of a fly, taking this opportunity to give birth to his maggots.

===&quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, 1980s and &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;===
In &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, Mephisto seeks to steal the Beyonder&#x27;s powers or to destroy him to win the favor of Death. Mephisto sends an army of supervillains called the Legion Accursed to attack the Beyonder, who is saved by the Thing. After the Legion Accursed was defeated, Mephisto returned its members to where they were before he formed the group.

Mephisto later creates himself a son, Blackheart, a demonic entity that plagues many of Earth&#x27;s heroes. a daughter, Mephista (who later renames herself Jezebel to separate herself from him), and a human son, Father John Priest. Mephisto later manipulates the sorcerer Master Pandemonium into gathering the five scattered fragments of his soul that were lost in an ill-fated encounter with the aforementioned Franklin Richards. When the Scarlet Witch attempts to use magic to conceive children with her husband, the android Vision, she unknowingly summons two of Pandemonium&#x27;s soul fragments, which are born as her infant twins. The revelation of her children&#x27;s origin, followed by their loss when they are reabsorbed into him, drives the Scarlet Witch insane.

Mephisto also tries to destroy the Avenger Hawkeye when he enters Hell to try to save the soul of his deceased wife, Mockingbird.

Mephisto acted as a servant of the mad Titan Thanos during the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot;, seeking to attain power for himself.

Alongside the Grim Reaper, Blackheart brings Wonder Man to Mephisto&#x27;s realm to battle Mephisto.

In a series of confrontations that also involve the Ghost Rider, the Punisher and the Wolverine, Blackheart kills Mephisto and takes over his portion of Hell. Mephisto survives, although as more of a ghostly apparition (claiming he had been denied a place in both Heaven and Hell), and for a time tricks the Silver Surfer into believing he was dead so as to collect his soul and thus perhaps regain his former power, but the Surfer refutes him and, with his allies, defeats Mephisto, resulting in his spirit form being seemingly destroyed.

Mephisto again survives death and soon finds himself with access to another universe: the Earth of the Top Cow universe. Seeking to torment an entirely new world of superheroes, he plots to enter this world and remake it for his own dark desires. But Eternity senses this cosmic disruption and sends several heroes (Jennifer Kale, the Wolverine, the Ghost Rider, the Silver Surfer and Elektra) to that universe to aid a group of Top Cow heroes (Witchblade, Weapon Zero, Cyblade and Ballistic) to combat and ultimately defeat Mephisto. However, his resulting banishment back to Earth-616 seemed to restore him as a tangible physical threat, though without his elevated place of Hellish power, and he would torment heroes for some years to come, like Nighthawk, the Black Panther, the Slingers, the Hellcat and Magik.

===2000s===
====&quot;One More Day&quot;====
Mephisto heals May Parker in exchange for changing the personal timelines of Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Mary Jane Watson so that they never married, claiming he did so only because he hated their happiness (also adding that he has no interest in taking Spider-Man&#x27;s soul because such a deal would result in him tormenting a soul that is willing to accept the punishment because its sacrifice saved another, a righteousness which disgusts him). He also, at Mary Jane&#x27;s request, erases all knowledge of Peter&#x27;s secret identity, both learning only at the point of their memories being erased that their future daughter will be erased as well. During the process, Harry Osborn is also brought back to life; the alteration of the timeline retcons the details of Harry&#x27;s death being faked by his father.

In 2021, it was revealed that Mephisto had an interest in destroying Peter&#x27;s personal life because he had foreseen a future in which he attacked Earth: at first, the vision is presented in such a way that Mephisto and his demons have managed to take over, only to be overthrown by Peter. However, Doctor Strange deduced the demon was lying by noting Mephisto always did more than hurt Peter alone. In truth, the demon&#x27;s vision was that Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s future daughter, May Day Parker, would be the one to end his reign. By attacking their relationship, Mephisto was thus hoping to avert the destruction of his future empire.

===2010s===
====&quot;Siege&quot;====

Mephisto had bartered part of his realm to the Asgardian death goddess Hela for 1,001 years in exchange for control for 101 days of the 13 surviving Dísir, dangerous evil predecessors to the Valkyries that were created by Odin&#x27;s father Bor. This troubles the minions who had previously lived in this territory, and part of &quot;Siege Aftermath&quot; shows the &quot;last stand of the perfidious diaspora&quot; in what seems to have been a revolt. The revolt is quickly put down by the Dísir under Mephisto&#x27;s command. The Dísir leader Brün tries to negotiate with Mephisto because she wishes to invade Hela&#x27;s realm of Hel and feast on the souls of the Asgardian dead. Mephisto tells her that he has no interest in Hel, but he does not object to their invasion. Thor, trying to defend Hel and its dead, enters Mephisto&#x27;s domain to find the Eir-gram, a magical sword that can cut the otherwise insubstantial Dísir. Mephisto offers to give him the Eir-Gram and a &quot;happily ever after&quot; for Asgard if he agrees not to interfere with one of Mephisto&#x27;s plans, which is not at that time named. Thor remains silent the whole time. Mephisto grants him entry to Hell, but Thor must survive many difficulties before he finds the blade.

====&quot;Fear Itself&quot;====

Mephisto appears before a de-powered Johnny Blaze during the attack by Sin in the form of Skadi and states that he has damned the human race. Mephisto then states that he will help Johnny save the human race from the Serpent and the Worthy. Mephisto goes on a date with New Mutants member Magma; apparently confiding in her, he explains that, while he is the embodiment of one of the great forces of the universe, the force that created him also gave him desires and emotions, and he occasionally wants to do things that humans do. Magma later confided to Blink that she has subsequently seen Mephisto again, but wishes to keep it secret. After speaking with the Gods at the Infinite Embassy, Mephisto headed to the Devil&#x27;s Advocacy to speak with the other demons about the Serpent&#x27;s threat on Earth.

Mephisto briefly appears to assist Deadpool in destroying one of his demon lieutenants, before taking a major part in the Hell on Earth War, where he apparently gived deathly visions of the future to the former X-Factor member Darwin and appears before him as an adult man named Tier, who claims that he is the son of Rahne Sinclair and he was to bring about the apocalypse. This is what drove Darwin to begin hunting the actual Tier in the first place. Mephisto is defeated however and replaced by X-Factor member Strong Guy as ruler of Hell.

====Remaining era====
When the Thunderbolts were accidentally transported to Hell, Mephisto took the opportunity to give them a way out if they defeated Strong Guy. The Red Hulk convinced Strong Guy to abandon the position of Hell-lord and try to regain his lost soul, allowing Mephisto to regain the throne of Hell and let the Thunderbolts return to Earth.

===The New Multiverse===
Mephisto is revealed to have assumed the form of the Maker to try to prevent Victor von Doom from redeeming his soul.

====&quot;Damnation&quot;====
Mephisto finds out that Doctor Strange has restored the lives of the Las Vegas citizens that were killed during when HYDRA bombed an attack during the organization&#x27;s takeover of the United States. He orchestrates events that cause his demons to bring Doctor Strange to his recently created Hotel Inferno. Mephisto claims that the remnants of Las Vegas were in his realm before it was restored. Hotel Inferno starts to have an effect on the people of Las Vegas. It also had an effect on the Black Panther, Captain Marvel, the Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster&#x27;s Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures. As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las Vegas, Doctor Strange fought Mephisto in a game of blackjack. The deal is that Mephisto had to return the souls to Las Vegas if Doctor Strange won and that Doctor Strange&#x27;s soul would be claimed by Mephisto if Mephisto won. Though Doctor Strange won by cheating, Mephisto found out and had Doctor Strange tortured. Mephisto then turns Doctor Strange into a Ghost Rider-like creature. After Mephisto removes the Ghost Rider from Johnny Blaze, he throws Blaze from the roof. Mephisto appeared on the battlefield and gloated on them, sending Johnny Blaze to attack him. Just then, the possessed Avengers attack Mephisto, as Wong revealed that Mephisto rendering his throne vacant has enabled the Ghost Rider to become the new ruler of Mephisto&#x27;s realm. After Doctor Strange returned from the Realm Between, he assisted the Midnight Sons and the Avengers in preventing Mephisto from returning to his realm to reclaim his throne. Though Doctor Strange defeated him, Mephisto fled back to his realm where he was defeated by Johnny Blaze and the different Ghost Riders from across the Multiverse. After Johnny Blaze sent Mephisto back to Earth, he was kept at the top of Hotel Inferno in countless restraints as Hotel Inferno remained on Earth. As Doctor Strange, the Avengers, and the Midnight Sons left upon Las Vegas returning to normal, Wong remained behind to keep an eye on Hotel Inferno&#x27;s casino.

In an alternate future where Thanos conquered the universe, Frank Castle signs a demonic deal with Mephisto to become a Ghost Rider, becoming known as the Cosmic Ghost Rider after being bestowed with the Power Cosmic by Galactus, before coming to serve Thanos after spending countless years on a lifeless Earth after Mephisto&#x27;s eventual silence, and going insane. After Thanos has Cosmic Ghost Rider drag his past self to the future to kill him, the past Thanos, upon returning to the present, beats up Mephisto and tells him to stay away from Castle, confusing Mephisto and as such bringing Castle to his attention; Mephisto is subsequently beaten up by Gwen Poole and Squirrel Girl.

Doctor Strange later spoke to Mephisto about removing the One Below All&#x27;s possession from the Hulk after the brief Defenders reunion. Mephisto states that the One Below All is far stronger than he is. Miles Morales later makes a deal with Mephisto to reverse time and resurrect Viv Vision and Kamala Khan, unknowingly at the cost of the death of a woman Miles had earlier saved.

====&quot;War of the Realms&quot;====

A flashback revealed that Mephisto came into contact with the Power Elite at some point and helped them out by creating simulacrums that the Power Elite programmed to become the Squadron Supreme of America. This group is used by a somehow-revived Phil Coulson to become the sanctioned superhero team for the United States.

====&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;″s aftermath====

When the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 threatens the life of James Martin, the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in the Proto-Clone) uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call Mephisto, who states that the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction. The Superior Spider-Man asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight the Spider-Man of Earth-44145. While Mephisto states that he either has or does not have his soul, he does have a counteroffer that will restore his body without disease (physical and mental) and the taint of Peter Parker. As the Superior Spider-Man tells Anna Maria Marconi that there is no other option, he expects Mephisto to uphold his end of the bargain.

===2020s===
====&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;====

After being killed by Deadpool and going to Hell after his death for unspecified war crimes, Phil Coulson makes a deal with Mephisto to be restored to life in exchange for his fealty, with Mephisto creating simulacrums of the Squadron Supreme of America for him to control as a United States-sponsored superhero team. Coulson later wines with Mephisto while discussing his own plans to destroy the Avengers. After acquiring the Pandemonium Cube, Coulson uses it to rewrite reality in Mephisto&#x27;s name, erasing the Avengers from existence and making himself the President of the United States. After his role in the reality change is discovered and he is defeated by his former idol Captain America, Coulson is imprisoned in the Pandemonium Cube by Mephisto as punishment and brought before a collection of Mephisto&#x27;s counterparts from 615 other universes, with whom Mephisto proposes forming a &quot;Council of Red&quot; for multiversal conquest.

====&quot;Sinister War&quot;====

Doctor Strange later visited Mephisto at the Hotel Inferno asking about what was wrong with Peter Parker&#x27;s soul as well as how Harry Osborn was seemingly revived as Kindred. It was during this confrontation that Mephisto confesses his true motivations for erasing the marriage of the Parkers, as at some undisclosed point in the future he finally seizes control of Earth, only for his reign to be ended by either Spider-Man or his daughter. Striking a deal with Peter to affect his soul and erasing both his marriage with Mary Jane and their daughter was Mephisto&#x27;s way of ensuring that that future would never come to pass in either scenario. Mephisto is also revealed as the one responsible for the torment and creation of the Kindred Twins (the souls of Sarah and Gabriel, clones previously created by a temporarily insane Harry when he was alive and a posthumous A.I. of him to pose as the children of his father and Gwen Stacy, merged with the A.I. in physical demonic forms) as part of his long game waged against Peter Parker and the Osborn family, as well for Norman Osborn&#x27;s initial transformations into the Green Goblin, having long ago made a deal with him in exchange for Harry&#x27;s soul. Doctor Strange then strikes a deal with Mephisto to have Harry&#x27;s soul returned to the body of his clone as the clone is dying, alongside the Kindred Twins.

====Using the Multiversal Masters of Evil====
At the time when a version of Doctor Doom named Doom Supreme watched the Prehistoric Avengers send Kid Thanos back to his own time, Mephisto approached Doom Supreme and suggested to him that he put together a team that would defeat any team of Avengers. Doom Supreme took Mephisto&#x27;s offer and formed a Multiversal version of the Masters of Evil consisting of a version of Kid Thanos, a version of Dark Phoenix and her pet Berserkers, a version of Erik Killmonger called King Killmonger, a version of the Green Goblin with Ghost Rider-like powers called the Ghost Goblin, and the Black Skull. Due to their agreement with the Council of Reds, they had to save Earth-616 for last. After each of the attacks from the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos meet up with the Iron Inquisitor and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of the Orb. Under Mephisto&#x27;s orders, Doom Supreme unburns Uatu&#x27;s eye fragment and puts it in his own eye. As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and the Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto&#x27;s dog form eats at the fragments of Uatu&#x27;s eye. Then he has the Orb&#x27;s corpse dumped into the ocean.

The Serpent Society later performed a ritual to summon the &quot;serpent&quot; that they worshiped by taking some lives of the people in Serpent Solutions&#x27; old headquarters. When the Avengers arrive and found that Nighthawk defeated them, the portal that formed during the ritual summons Mephisto&#x27;s dog form, as it was mentioned by Nighthawk that the serpent was one of Mephisto&#x27;s forms. Before assuming his true form and retreating, Mephisto makes the Council of Reds known to the Avengers.

In the distant past, Mephisto encounters Avenger Prime who states that he came to watch Mephisto lose. They watch as the Avengers arrive and confront the Prehistoric Avengers. As both Avengers fight, Avenger Prime goes on the offensive against Mephisto as Mephisto summons the Council of Reds to help subdue him. The Council of Reds begin their attack on the Avengers Tower in the God Quarry as the Ghost Rider&#x27;s Hell Charger drives into some of them. After the Council of Reds have been decimated by the Multiversal Avengers with help from Old Man Phoenix and the Granddaughters of King Thor, Captain Marvel, Nighthawk, and Thor of Earth-56377 find a smaller version of Mephisto who is the last of the Council of Reds. Just then, Mephisto appears and absorbs his variant as he appears in gigantic size, claiming that the Council of Reds had served their purpose. He then quotes &quot;Welcome, Avengers, to the end of everything&quot;. As Mephisto returns to Earth-616 during prehistoric times, a recuperated Kid Thanos informs him that Ghost Goblin and King Killmonger are dead, Black Skull was stripped of his Symbiote, and Doom Supreme and Dark Phoenix have fled. As Kid Thanos is shown with the corpses of Ghost Goblin, Hound, and King Killmonger as well as the unconscious body of Red Skull, Kid Thanos states that he can obtain the fresh knowledge of his fallen teammates on his dissection table as Mephisto states that Black Skull is not dead yet. When Kid Thanos states that it is a bad idea to take on the Avengers by himself, Mephisto enters a portal as he quotes &quot;Taking on the Avengers myself. Heh. That&#x27;s a fine idea&quot;. Arriving in the God Quarry, the Council of Red tell Mephisto that they are displeased with his actions and how their teammates fell to the Multiversal Avengers. Mephisto proceeds to kill the remaining Council of Red members and absorb them into his body. After defeating Captain Marvel, Nighthawk, and Thor of Earth-56377, a Celestial-sized Mephisto is spotted by Ant-Man of Earth-818 as Mephisto destroys the Carol Corps&#x27; Omni-Carrier causing Ant-Man of Earth-818 to inform Avenger Prime of what happened. Reinforcements come in the form of Ka-Zar, an alternate Galactus from the reality that Iron Inquisitor sent Ka-Zar from, Gorilla-Man, Ursa Major, and the Progenitor which was modified with Deathlok technology. As Mephisto goes on the attack, the Deathlok-modified Progenitor fights him. He proceeds to eat the remains of his fallen Council of Red members before resuming the fight. As the God Quarry begins to crumble, Mephisto takes a sample of the power from below it as Old Man Phoenix and Avenger Prime recognize the energies as the remnants of an ancient Multiverse where there is no running from it as Mephisto plans to use its powers to end the Multiverse. After he was separated from his fallen Mephisto variants, Mephisto was confronted by Doom Supreme who stated that he is too weak to wield the power he just unleashed. Mephisto states that he was planning to use this power to free himself from his usual lifestyle. Doom Supreme then turns against Mephisto by attacking him. After Doom Supreme is turned to stone by the sample of the ancient Multiverse&#x27;s energy, Iron Man and Ant-Man of Earth-818 plan to deal with Mephisto. As the reconstructed Doom the Living Planet and the Mjolnir variants work to clog the breach, Mephisto claims that they can&#x27;t hold back the entrophy as he is punched by Nighthawk and Agamotto does a special punishment for him. Once he is back in Hell, Mephisto is annoyed with Orb next to him. Mephisto is annoyed with Orb mentioning that Avenger Prime no longer stands watch alone in the God Quarry.

==Powers and abilities==
Mephisto is an extremely powerful immortal demonic entity possessing abilities used by manipulating the forces of magic. Mephisto can employ his power for a variety of uses, including superhuman physical attributes, shape and sizeshifting, projecting illusions, manipulating memories, and altering time and reality. He is also highly resistant to injury. With his regenerative healing factor, Mephisto has the ability to recover quickly.

The character has been shown to be energized by sources of evil in the human realm, such as the alien Dire Wraiths. Like other demons, Mephisto is symbiotically linked to, and considerably more powerful within, his own realm, and the character is able to transform the structure at will. Within it he has threatened a galaxy and stalemated a nourished Galactus until the latter threatened to consume his realm. If Mephisto&#x27;s physical form is destroyed, the character will regenerate and reform in his domain. Mephisto is known for acquiring souls, but cannot subjugate the will of another being without the victim&#x27;s permission, which is usually done with some form of pact.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Critical reception===
George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; stated, &quot;Mephisto may be one of Marvel&#x27;s most iconic, enduring villains - and that&#x27;s no surprise considering he&#x27;s based on the archetype of the Christian devil, pretty much the most iconic &#x27;villain&#x27; in religion, folklore, and in some cases, even as a metaphorical force in world history. Marvel&#x27;s comic book take on the concept of an omnipotent, omniscient infernal manipulator who rules over his own realm of eternal punishment through treachery and torture has had a similar impact on the history of the Marvel Universe. Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called Mephisto one of the &quot;greatest monstrous creations that ever sprang from the nightmares of the House of Ideas,&quot; writing, &quot;You can&#x27;t very well have a list of the most nefarious Marvel monsters without listing the devil, hisownself. Not really the Biblical devil, Mephisto is a netherworldly tempter, a soul broker, and a liar who pretty much serves the same exact purpose as the Devil but he won&#x27;t get Marvel in trouble with Christian conservatives. Mephisto first battled the Silver Surfer in the Silver Age (HEY!) and has bedeviled (hiYO) just about every Marvel hero. He recently pissed off fandom by cutting a Faustian deal with Peter Parker and erasing Spidey&#x27;s marriage. Mephisto was a key figure in The Infinity Gauntlet, constantly whispering Iago like in Thanos&#x27; ear and is the very symbol of corruption in the Marvel Universe.&quot;

In the 1800s, he turned Carter Slade into his Ghost Rider to retrieve the Contract of San Venganza, but Slade betrayed Mephistopheles. In 1986, Johnny Blaze makes a deal with Mephistopheles to save the former&#x27;s father from cancer in return for serving the devil at a future date, only for Blaze&#x27;s father to die in an accident the next day. In the present, Mephistopheles transforms Blaze into his latest Ghost Rider to hunt down his traitorous son Blackheart before the demon can find the contract. After receiving help from Slade, Blaze defeats Blackheart and defies Mephistopheles by keeping his Ghost Rider powers instead of returning them, despite him offering to remove them.
* Mephisto, as the Devil, appears in &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;. He takes the form of a man named Roarke (portrayed by Ciarán Hinds) and fathers a son with a woman named Nadya after saving her life.

However, Johnny Blaze protects the Danny, who boosts Blaze&#x27;s powers so he can send the devil back to Hell.

<doc id="719044" wikidata="Q7369154" url="?curid=719044" title="Ross–Loos Medical Group">
<text>Ross–Loos Medical Group was a comprehensive prepaid health services plan with 29 medical offices throughout Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties in California and a large multi-specialty hospital located on Temple Street, Los Angeles.

==Founding==
Ross-Loos was established in 1929 by two physicians: Donald E. Ross and H. Clifford Loos, older brother of writer Anita Loos. The plan consisted of monthly payments which assured benefits of medical and hospital care to over two thousand employees of Los Angeles County and the Department of Water and Power and their families.

The founders believed that health care could be improved by combining prepayment of services, eliminating the financial barriers faced by patients at the time of needed care, with the sharing of medical records and the ease of consultation in a medical group. The focus was on the improvement of medical care quality, rather than financial success, and many concepts in those plans built on a public health approach that encouraged prevention. The plans included prenatal care, well-baby visits, and immunizations in standard benefit packages, with small or zero co-payments, at a time that even the hospital costs of maternity stays were often excluded from traditional insurance.

Ross–Loos Medical Group is the first HMO in the United States; the term &quot;managed care&quot; came about chiefly through the influence of U.S. President Nixon on February 17, 1971.

Over several years many other employee groups, mostly governmental, joined the plan. Ross-Loos was so successful that the first small medical office on Grand Avenue in Los Angeles expanded into an enormous organization with 29 medical offices and a large multi-specialty hospital, on Temple Street, Los Angeles, by 1979.

==Purchases==
In 1980, Ross–Loos Medical Group was purchased by the Insurance Company of North America (INA) HealthPlan (see HMO International and California Medical Group and merged into its medical office operations which created over twenty-nine medical office locations throughout southern California. Its new name was &quot;INA and Ross-Loos HealthPlans&quot;. This new operational name was in existence a short time until 1982; through a merger of the Insurance Company of North America (INA) and Connecticut General (CG) their names changed to become CIGNA. Ross–Loos Medical Group, became known as CIGNA HealthPlans of Southern California and was merged into the large CIGNA Employee Benefits Division. In 1997 CIGNA made a decision to divest itself of its &quot;owned delivery system&quot; or &quot;staff model&quot; (see HMO – staff model) and sold their operations to MedPartners. The sale to MedPartners also caused a new name change of the CIGNA &quot;owned delivery system&quot; in Southern California, The system became merged into the recent purchase in Southern California by Medpartners of the Friendly Hills Medical Group. In 1999, MedPartners was placed in receivership for its inability to manage the combined operations of its Southern California subsidiaries Friendly Hills Medical Group, Talbert Medical Group, Mullikan Medical Group, Vineyard Medical Group, and Riverside Medical Clinic. Those MedPartners-owned facilities were divested and sold to physician-owned delivery systems or closed.

The MedPartners name was changed to Caremark Rx, the Talbert Medical Group was sold to the physicians of the Talbert Medical Group; the Riverside Medical Clinic was sold back to the member physicians, remaining in operation, with over 130 physicians; and the Mullikan and Vineyard Medical Groups were eventually closed. The Friendly Hills Medical Group was acquired by KPC Global Care, now in Chadhuri Medical Group, and briefly continued operations until it too was placed into receivership by the California Department of Corporations in 1999 and closed down. The original Ross–Loos Medical Group facilities were closed and Medical Center – Hospital on Temple Street in Los Angeles was sold to Silverlake Medical Center then eventually sold and renamed L.A. Downtown Medical Center.

The original Ross–Loos Medical Group, medical offices and hospital ended with that sale in 1999 some 70 years after its beginning.

==Current status==
The names &quot;Ross-Loos&quot;, &quot;Ross Loos Medical Group&quot;, and &quot;Ross Loos HealthPlans&quot; are still owned by CIGNA Corporation and remain registered with the State of California Department of Corporations, Department of Insurance, and Department of Managed Care.

A street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles bears the name Ross Loos Place. The road leads to the Medical Center.

SR 58 also provides access to Edwards Air Force Base. At various points it is known as the Calf Canyon Highway, Carrisa Highway, Bakersfield-McKittrick Highway, Rosa Parks Highway, Westside Parkway, Barstow-Bakersfield Highway, Bakersfield Tehachapi Highway, Kern County Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, and Mojave-Barstow Highway.

==Route description==

The California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 58 in section 358, subdivision (a). The latest amendment, effective January 1, 2015, defines the route as follows:
Route 58 is from:
(1) Route 101 near Santa Margarita to Route 33.(2) Route 33 to Route 43.(3) Route 43 to just west of Van Buren Place near Bakersfield.(4) Mohawk Street near Bakersfield to Route 99.(5) Route 99 to Route 15 near Barstow via Bakersfield and Mojave.

Due to ongoing freeway construction projects in Bakersfield and unincorporated Kern and San Bernardino counties, the definition has yet to be amended by the legislature and may not accurately reflect current or former rights of way maintained by Caltrans.

State Route 58 between Santa Margarita and Buttonwillow is a winding mountain road through a thinly populated area. From its westernmost terminus at US 101 near Santa Margarita, a few miles north of San Luis Obispo, SR 58 heads east along the former US 101 (El Camino Real) for one mile. SR 58 then heads east and up the winding mountain road, passing through a thinly populated area and an intersection with SR 229. Alternatives such as SR 46 to the north or SR 166 to the south are recommended, as much of this section of SR 58 is prohibited to truck traffic. However, this section of SR 58 does pass through the Carrizo Plain, which is known for its scenic beauty and geological features, including the San Andreas Fault. SR 58 then takes another winding road before joining with State Route 33 in the small town of McKittrick. SR 33 then splits at the north end of McKittrick before SR 58 then enters another, but brief winding road. SR 58 then proceeds northeast for several miles before changing to an east-west alignment and reaching Buttonwillow. SR 58 then joins with the north-south Interstate 5 (I-5) for a few miles to Stockdale Highway, where it resumes heading east and intersects with State Route 43 before reaching Bakersfield. In Bakersfield, the route follows the Westside Parkway to reach State Route 99 at the West Bakersfield Interchange.

East of SR 99, SR 58 briefly enters expressway status with two at-grade intersections in the Caliente area before resuming freeway status east of Caliente. SR 58 then reaches the Tehachapi city limits and traverses the Tehachapi Pass before dropping out of the Tehachapi Mountains into the Antelope Valley at the town of Mojave. Freeway conditions continue from State Route 14 east of Mojave bypassing North Edwards, Edwards Air Force Base, Boron, and Kramer Junction. Approximately east of an interchange with U.S. Route 395, SR 58 resumes expressway status with two lanes in each direction until just before reaching the easternmost terminus at Interstate 15 in Barstow.

With the lack of four-lane or greater, divided highways that cross the Sierra Nevada between SR 58 at the Tehachapi Pass and Interstate 80 at Donner Summit about hundreds of miles to the north, I-5 and SR 58 are used by motorists to travel between Northern California and points to the southeast, such as Las Vegas (via I-15) and Interstate 40, without having to face the extreme traffic congestion of greater Los Angeles.

SR 58 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and east of I-5 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 58 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. SR 58 has several names throughout its length, including the Blue Star Memorial Highway (for its entire length); the Kern County Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, for the section from SR 184 to the Kern County/San Bernardino County Line; and the Rosa Parks Highway, for the section between SR 99 and SR 184. The Korean War Veterans name honors the approximately 8,120 veterans from Kern County, while the section named for Rosa Parks honors the civil rights activist. The portion of SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield is sometimes referred to as the Barstow–Bakersfield Highway.

==History==


State Route 58 did not exist as a California sign route until 1964, although previous to 1964, it was part of California Legislative Route 58. The other part of Legislative Route 58 is California&#x27;s segment of Interstate 40; previous to 1964 it was a segment of US 66.

Prior to 1964, the segment of State Route 58 between Bakersfield and Barstow was signed U.S. Route 466. Also at that time, the segment of SR 58 between State Route 33 at McKittrick and State Route 99 in Bakersfield was signed as State Route 178. Although it was proposed for signing as Route 178 in 1934, the segment of Legislative Route 58 between US 101 near Santa Margarita and State Route 33 at McKittrick was not signed prior to 1964.

Note that US 466 was co-signed with US 99, now State Route 99, between Bakersfield and Famoso Junction. Between Famoso and US 101 at Paso Robles, US 466 largely became SR 46.

The eastern terminus was originally at I-15 in northeastern Barstow. SR 58 was rerouted to I-15 in Barstow south of the I-40 interchange in . The former eastern terminus is now known as &quot;Old Highway 58&quot;.

Freeway bypasses in Tehachapi, Boron, Mojave, Hinkley, and Kramer Junction were completed in , 1981, 2003, 2017, and 2020, respectively.

===Westside Parkway and the Centennial Corridor Project===
In western Bakersfield, the Westside Parkway, a freeway running from Stockdale Highway (near Heath Road) east to Truxtun Avenue, was completed on April 15, 2015, with interchanges in between at Allen Road, Calloway Drive, Coffee Road, and Mohawk Street. Opening in stages since 2013, the road was originally under the jurisdiction of the city of Bakersfield. As part of the Centennial Corridor project, Caltrans built an extension of the Westside Parkway east to the junction of SR 58 and SR 99 at the West Bakersfield Interchange. Although construction was controversial since it displaced dozens of homes and businesses, by September 2017, all but a few buildings in the path had been demolished.

On February 5, 2021, the city transferred the Westside Parkway to Caltrans and California Highway Patrol jurisdiction. City officials then announced in October 2022 that the project was nearly complete, and that they were working on the last 800 feet of the connection, specifically, the northbound SR 99 to westbound SR 58 transition ramp, with an estimated 8 months of construction left. Meanwhile, Caltrans began installing signage rerouting SR 58 traffic from I-5 onto Stockdale Highway and the Westside Parkway east to at least Mohawk Street.

The Centennial Corridor was inaugurated on February 9, 2024, with a ceremonial bicycle ride, and officially opened to traffic on February 17, 2024, with some connections between SR 58 and SR 99 remaining closed. The rest of SR 58 on Rosedale Highway between Mohawk Street and SR 99 is planned to be transferred to city control. Future plans are to upgrade Stockdale Highway from I-5 to Heath Road as a freeway.

==Major intersections==
Exits on the Westside Parkway segment are currently unnumbered.

<text>Data Darbar () is an Islamic shrine located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. It is the largest Sufi shrine in South Asia. It was built to house the remains of al-Hujwiri, commonly known as &quot;Data Ganj Baksh&quot; or more colloquially as &quot;Data Sahab&quot;, a Sufi saint from Ghazni in present-day Afghanistan, who is believed to have lived on the site in the 11th century CE. 

The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore, and attracts up to one million visitors to its annual &quot;urs&quot; festival.

==Location==
Data Darbar is located in the center of Old City Lahore. Surrounding it are Lower Mall Road, Bhati Gate, Gawalmandi &amp; Karbala Gamay Shah.

==History==
The shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Ali Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a larger shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri during the Mughal period. The shrine complex was expanded in the 19th century, and Hujwiri&#x27;s mosque rebuilt. However, some historians claim that the present shrine doesn&#x27;t house the grave of Ali Hujwiri. This place was a site where he used to come for worship. His actual grave is hidden in Shahi Qilla, Lahore.
The shrine came under Pakistani government control as part of the &quot;Auquf Ordinance of 1960&quot;, with the official aim of preventing shrine caretakers throughout the country from financially exploiting devotees. The shrine was greatly expanded in the 1980s under the rule of military leader Zia ul-Haq, during which time the shrine became the largest in South Asia. Offices for NGOs, a library, &quot;madrasa&quot;, police station, carpark, and offices were all added under his regime. Designated spaces for musical performances, and new free kitchen were also added during that time. New markets have emerged around the site since its massive expansion.

Since 1965, the &quot;mehfil-e-sama&quot;, a 2-day &quot;qawwali&quot; music festival, had been held adjacent to the shrine, which in 1992 shifted to a nearby school. 

=== Terror attacks ===
On 2010, two suicide bombers attacked the shrine. At least 50 people were killed, and 200 others were hurt in the blasts. On 8 May 2019, another blast at the same site killed twelve people included police officials Saddam Hussain, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Muhammad Sohail, Head Constable Gulzar Ahmad, Constable Muhammad Saleem, and security guard Rafaqat Ali near the entrance gate for female visitors.

== Architecture ==

The shrine of Hujwiri is housed in a Mughal era tomb crafted of carved white marble. The tomb is surrounded by a massive marble courtyard, while a new educational institution at the shrine complex utilizes modernist architecture.

==Significance==
The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore. The shrine has emerged a major economic, political, and social centre in Lahore, and is one of the only places in Lahore where the extremely rich and extremely poor share space together.

It is widely believed among devotees that the saint interred at the shrine is the supreme authority over all Sufi saints in the Indian subcontinent, and that no new Sufi saint could immigrate to the subcontinent without obtaining permission from the spirit of Hujwiri.

Following the establishment of a shrine dedicated to Hujwiri, his tomb was visited by Muslims and non-Muslims in search of his blessings. Illustrious figures such as Baba Farid, Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya, Dara Shikoh, and Allama Iqbal all paid obeisance to the shrine, and pledged allegiance to Hujwiri. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was a frequent visitor to the shrine.

Hujwiri&#x27;s teachings were critical of practices associated with South Asian Islam, such as the use of drugs, and dancing. He also taught that Sufi saints were themselves still obliged to the demands of Islam, and so is revered by reformist Muslims who are critical of Sufi practice, as well as traditionalist Muslims who revere Sufi shrines.

&quot;Qawwali&quot; performances are regularly held at the shrine. On special occasions, the shrine is decorated with lights, dinner is prepared for thousands of visitors, who also partake in dance while musicians play Sufi music for hours. At the boundary of the shrine, Muslim faithfuls recite the Qur&#x27;an, and pay tributes to the Prophet Muhammad. 
===Social services===
The shrine provides a wide array of social services which have made it a popular hub for impoverished residents. In a custom that is 1,000 years old, up to 50,000 visitors per day are offered free food at the shrine. Patrons facing personal difficulties frequently donate money or labour to the shrine&#x27;s free-kitchen fund, in line with Islam&#x27;s emphasis on feeding the poor. The shrine also provides for students&#x27; education in nearby schools, and helps fund local hospitals as part of its social mission.

==Access==
The shrine remains open at all hours, and welcomes visitors who freely enter the complex. The shrine is visited by approximately 30,000 to 60,000 visitors on a daily basis, though the number can double on religious holidays, and on Thursdays - the traditional night for visiting shrines. Approximately 1,000,000 devotees visit the shrine during its annual &quot;urs&quot; festival.

The shrine is served by the &quot;Bhatti Chowk&quot; station of the Lahore Metrobus.

==Administration==
The shrine is managed as part of an &quot;Auqaf&quot; foundation as part of the &quot;Auqaf Ordinance of 1960&quot;. The shrine is managed by approximately 200 full-time workers, excluding security services. The shrine produces the most revenue for the &quot;Auqaf&quot; board out of all the some 400 shrines under its control in Punjab province, and contributes approximately 33% of the board&#x27;s revenue. The shrine collects 4 times more income than is spent on the shrine&#x27;s upkeep. Considered to be the centre of all shrines in Punjab, religious practices and sermons are subject to more government regulation than at other shrines in Pakistan.

<text>Salomon Müller (7 April 1804 – 29 December 1864) was a German naturalist. He was born in Heidelberg, and died in Freiburg im Breisgau.

Müller was the son of a saddler in Heidelberg. Along with Heinrich Boie and Heinrich Christian Macklot, he was sent by Coenraad Jacob Temminck to collect specimens in the East Indies. Here, he worked as an assistant for the &quot;Natuurkundige Commissie&quot; (Commission for Natural Sciences), an organization that he eventually became a member of.

Müller arrived in Batavia in 1826, then journeyed to New Guinea and Timor in 1828 aboard the &quot;Triton&quot;. Beginning in October 1828, he remained at the port city of Kupang, penetrating the interior of Timor during the following year. In 1831, he was stationed in Java, and later explored western Sumatra from 1833 to 1835.

==Eponyms==
Hermann Schlegel named &quot;Aspidomorphus muelleri&quot; (Müller&#x27;s crown snake) and &quot;Sphenomorphus muelleri&quot; (Müller&#x27;s forest skink) in 1837, and &quot;Typhlops muelleri&quot; (Müller&#x27;s blind snake) in 1839, all in honor of Salomon Müller. (Müller in turn named &quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot; (the False gharial) in 1838 in honor of Hermann Schlegel.)

Similarly, André Marie Constant Duméril, Gabriel Bibron and Auguste Duméril named &quot;Lycodon muelleri&quot; (Java wolf snake) in 1854 in honor of Müller.

<doc id="719065" wikidata="Q11127451" url="?curid=719065" title="MacGuffin (cipher)">
<text>In cryptography, MacGuffin is a block cipher created in 1994 by Bruce Schneier and Matt Blaze at a Fast Software Encryption workshop. It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure, known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks (GUFNs). The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly, so quickly that the cipher was broken at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel.

==The algorithm==
Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES, their main change being that the data block is not split into equal halves in the Feistel network. Instead, 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function, whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block. The algorithm was experimental, intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks.

The adjacent diagram shows one round of MacGuffin. The 64-bit data block is broken into four 16-bit words (each represented by one line). The rightmost three are XORed with subkey bits derived from the secret key. They are then fed through eight S-boxes, each of which takes six bits of input and produces two bits of output. The output (a total of 16 bits) is then recombined and XORed with the leftmost word of the data block. The new leftmost block is then rotated into the rightmost position of the resulting data block. The algorithm then continues with more rounds.

MacGuffin&#x27;s key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself. Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network, decryption is easy; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse.

Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds, and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key.

==Cryptanalysis of MacGuffin==
At the same workshop where MacGuffin was introduced, Rijmen and Preneel showed that it was vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. They showed that 32 rounds of MacGuffin is weaker than 16 rounds of DES, since it took &quot;a few hours&quot; to get good differential characteristics for DES with good starting values, and the same time to get good differential characteristics for MacGuffin with no starting values. They found that it is possible to get the last round key with differential cryptanalysis, and from that reverse the last round; and then repeat the attack for the rest of the rounds.

Rijmen and Preneel tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes, taken directly from DES. This version proved to be slightly stronger, but they warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle.

<doc id="719074" wikidata="Q385406" url="?curid=719074" title="São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport">
<text>The São Paulo/Guarulhos–Governor André Franco Montoro International Airport , commonly known as São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport, is the primary international airport serving São Paulo, being the largest airport in Brazil, South America and one of the largest in the world. It is popularly known locally as either &quot;Cumbica Airport&quot;, after the district where it is located and the Brazilian Air Force base that exists at the airport complex, or Guarulhos Airport, after the municipality of Guarulhos, in the state of São Paulo, where it is located. Since November 28, 2001, the airport has been named after André Franco Montoro (1916–1999), former Governor of São Paulo state. The airport was rebranded as GRU Airport in 2012.

The airport is the busiest in Brazil in terms of transported passengers, aircraft operations, and cargo handled, placing it as the second busiest airport in Latin America by passenger traffic (41.307.915 in 2023) after Mexico City International Airport, making it one of the fifty busiest on the planet. Guarulhos has slot restrictions, operating with a maximum of 45 operations/hour and being one of the five airports with such restrictions in Brazil (the others are São Paulo-Congonhas, Brasília, Belo Horizonte-Pampulha and Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont).

Since 2012, the airport has been operated by a consortium composed of Invepar S/A, Airports Company South Africa, and Infraero. Some of its facilities are shared with the São Paulo Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force.

In 2017, it was considered by the company OAG the second best in punctuality in the world and first in Latin America, a position above that achieved in the previous year. In 2019 the airport achieved the same position in a survey carried out by FlightStats. In 2021, it was chosen by the Club Med study as one of the 35 best in the world for long layovers. In a survey carried out by Cirium Aviation, it reached first position among the most punctual large airports in the world and second place in the &quot;Global&quot; category in 2024; that same year, São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport was named one of the best airports in the world by AirHelp.

==History==
On June 6, 1967, in response to the growth of air traffic in Brazil, the Brazilian military government initiated studies concerning the renovation of the airport infrastructure in Brazil. As part of the conclusions of these studies, because of their location, strategic importance, and security issues, new passenger facilities would be constructed in the areas of the Galeão Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro and the São Paulo Air Force Base in São Paulo.

In relation to São Paulo, the initial planning of the airport involved three runways and four passenger terminals. However, the first phase of the construction comprising two runways and two terminals started only on August 11, 1980. The airport was officially inaugurated on January 20, 1985. Quickly Guarulhos became the city&#x27;s primary airport, supplanting São Paulo–Congonhas Airport.

In 1989, the runways were extended and the terminals renovated, enlarged, and had their capacity increased from 7.5 million to 8.25 million passengers/year. The whole complex covered , of which is urbanised area.

Construction of the Terminal 3, capable of handling 12 million passengers per year, had been planned since 2001 but due to a myriad of political and economic problems, the actual construction did not begin until 2011.

In 2010, the airport served more than 26.8 million passengers, an increase of 24% over 2009 and passenger volumes were 31% in excess of its capacity rated at 20.5 million per year at its present configuration.

In order to relieve the acute overcrowding at the Terminals 1 and 2, Infraero announced on May 17, 2011 that the former cargo terminals of the defunct airlines VASP and Transbrasil, later used by Federal Agencies, would undergo renovations and adaptations for use as domestic passenger terminals with remote boarding. This new terminal was initially called Terminal 4 (T4). The first phase of the renovations, comprising the former VASP terminal, opened on February 8, 2012, and the second phase, comprising the former Transbrasil terminal, was opened in June 2013. Contrary to what had been announced before, the new terminal will be permanent. Webjet was the first airline to use the new facility. The new terminal, in its first phase, increased the capacity of the airport in 5.5 million passengers/year and, in the second phase to 8 million passengers/year. In total, Guarulhos would then be able to handle 28.5 million passengers/year.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels. According to the list, Guarulhos was considered to be critically saturated, operating above 85% of its capacity.

Following a decision made on April 26, 2011 by the Federal Government for private companies being granted concessions to explore some Infraero airports, on February 6, 2012, the administration of the airport was conceded, for 20 years, to the Consortium Invepar–ACSA, also known as GRU Airport, composed by the Brazilian Invepar, an Investments and Funds Society (90%) and the South African ACSA–Airports Company South Africa (10%). Infraero, the state-run organisation, remains with 49% of the shares of the company incorporated for the administration.

On December 2, 2015, the airport&#x27;s terminals were renumbered. The former Terminal 4 was renumbered Terminal 1; the former terminals 1 and 2, which were wings of a single building, became the new Terminal 2. The Terminal 3 kept its numbering. The new numbering reflects the order by which terminals are reached when one arrives at the airport by the access road, and is expected to be less confusing in the long term. Check-in counters and gates were also renumbered, with the first digit being now the new terminal number.

On October 28, 2015, the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil (Anac) authorised Airbus A380 operations at Guarulhos Airport, effective four days later. The authorisation was granted after extensive works were conducted on the runways and taxiways (including widening runway 09L/27R to ) and special taxiing procedures were established. On November 14, 2015, Emirates operated a one-time special flight with the A380 on its Dubai-São Paulo route to commemorate its eight years of operations in Brazil.
On March 26, 2017, Emirates started daily A380 service from Dubai to São Paulo, replacing the Boeing 777-300ER previously used on that route – coincidentally, on the same day that the other UAE airline, Etihad, ended its services to São Paulo.

==Facilities==
===Runways and taxiways===
GRU has two parallel runways. Runway 10R/28L is long and wide, while runway 10L/28R is long and wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The field elevation at the airport is above mean sea level. Runway 10R/28L is mostly used for landings and runway 10L/28R for takeoffs. There are high-speed exit taxiways on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic. As of 2014, there was an average of 650 takeoff and landing operations per day at the airport.

===Terminals===
The airport has four passenger terminals, numbered 1, 2, and 3, according to their order along the airport access road when arriving from the city, plus a VIP terminal.

* The Terminal 1 is the smallest and simplest. It has only domestic flights, and as of January 2020, only Azul operates there, as former Passaredo (now VoePass) has been moved to the Terminal 2. The Terminal 1 has no jet bridges and no direct access to the other terminals, which can only be reached by a free shuttle bus.

* The Terminal 2 is the oldest and largest, and for many years was the sole airport terminal, although its two wings were considered different terminals at the time. It has the majority of domestic flights and to Latin American destinations, as well as a few intercontinental flights. The terminal is undergoing a retrofit process in the internal and external areas to modernize the facilities and improve the user experience. This terminal is divided into two boarding piers:

:* West Pier

::The West Pier has sixteen boarding bridges and only operates domestic flights.

:* East Pier

::The East Pier has thirteen boarding bridges and operates both domestic and international flights.

* The Terminal 3 is the newest and most modern. It has only international flights and concentrates most long-haul intercontinental traffic, in addition to the LATAM Group&#x27;s Latin American flights. It has a pier with twenty-two gates with fingers and five of them can accommodate the Airbus A380.

* A new VIP Terminal will be managed by BTG Pactual Bank and will be opened in December 2024, but access will be restricted to users who book and pay their entry and stay at the site.
The Terminals 2 and 3 are directly linked by a walkway.

The airport also has a large air cargo terminal with a built area of and is capable of handling any type of cargo, including refrigerated and hazardous shipments.

===Navigational aids===
There are two navigational aids that GRU traffic uses. The Bonsucesso very high frequency omnidirectional range with distance measuring equipment (VOR-DME) is located to the east of GRU.

==Developments==
In 2009 Infraero unveiled a R$ 1,489.5 million (US$784.7 USD million; €549.8 EUR million) investment plan to upgrade Guarulhos International Airport, focusing on preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics in 2016. The investment was supposed to be used as follows:

* Construction of additional taxiways. Cost: R$ 19M. Completion: April 2016.
* Enlargement of apron and taxiways. Cost: R$370,5M. Completion: May 2016.
* Construction of passenger Terminal 3. Cost: R$1,100M. Completed: March 2014. Opened for Star Alliance airlines in May.
Central to this investment plan was Terminal 3, which is projected to add 12 million passenger capacity to the 17 million of the existing two terminals. Plans for a third runway were decided to be &quot;technically impracticable&quot; and were cancelled in January 2008.

However, the former concessionary, Infraero, experienced many legal and bureaucratic difficulties, which prevented most (if any) of these improvements from being completed on schedule. As of April 2013, the new concessionary unveiled a new expansion project, which included the new Terminal 3 (with a different design than the one proposed by Infraero), the widening of the main runway in order to enable operations by the large Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-8, operated by Emirates and Lufthansa respectively, and several other improvements in the existing terminals and parking area.

The Terminal 3 is open and all Star Alliance airlines are in, as well as many other overseas carriers. International flights by LATAM also use the facility.

A train service development and construction has also been planned, however never concluded and cancelled. This included an Airport Express Line linking the airport to downtown São Paulo and a Rio–São Paulo high-speed rail connecting Guarulhos to Rio de Janeiro-Galeão and Campinas-Viracopos airports.

Since March 2017 American Airlines invested US$ 100 million on a maintenance hangar at Guarulhos Airport, building together with the LATAM Hangar of R$ 130 million. The American Airlines one is capable of performing line maintenance on two wide-body aircraft at the same time, of the types commonly used by the U.S. company on routes between São Paulo and the United States and the LATAM one is capable of performing line maintenance of one wide-body aircraft. It could also be used by other companies as storage for parts. The same conditions applies to the LATAM maintenance center.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===


===Cargo===

==Statistics==

Following is the number of passenger, aircraft and cargo movements at the airport, according to Infraero (2007-2012) and GRU Airport (2013-2023) reports:

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 28, 1986, a VASP Boeing 737-2A1 registered PP-SME flying from Guarulhos to Belo Horizonte unknowingly tried to take-off from Guarulhos, during foggy conditions, from a taxiway. The take-off was aborted, but the aircraft overran, collided with a dyke and broke in two. One passenger died.
* On March 21, 1989, a Transbrasil Cargo Boeing 707-349C registered PT-TCS operating Flight 801, flying from Manaus to São Paulo-Guarulhos, crashed at the district of Vila Barros in Guarulhos, shortly before touch-down at runway 09R. That day, at 12:00, the runway was going to be closed for maintenance and the crew decided to speed up procedures to touch-down before closure (it was already 11:54). In a hurry, one of the crew members, by mistake, activated the air-dynamic brakes, and the aircraft lost too much speed to have enough aerodynamic support (resulting in a stall). As a consequence the aircraft crashed approximately from the airport. There were 25 fatalities, of which three were crew members and 22 were civilians on the ground. As well as the 22 fatalities, there were over 200 injured on the ground.
* On March 2, 1996, a Madrid Táxi Aéreo Gates Learjet 25D registered PT-LSD transporting the Brazilian band Mamonas Assassinas crashed into Cantareira mountain range, located north of the airport, at 23:16 local time killing all 9 passengers on board. The aircraft was on final approach to land on the runway 09R, but went around. As it flew toward the runway for a second attempt to land, the ATC instructed the pilots to make a right turn heading south, but they turned north (left) and crashed into the mountain range at , from the airport. Ironically, all band members were from a Guarulhos neighborhood located close to the airport.
* On September 14, 2002, a Total Linhas Aéreas ATR42-312 registered PT-MTS on a cargo flight between São Paulo-Guarulhos and Londrina crashed while en route near Paranapanema. The crew of 2 died.

* 9 November 2024: Total Linhas Aéreas Flight 5682, a Boeing 737-400SF registered as PS-TLB, flying from Eurico de Aguiar Salles Airport in Vitória, made an emergency landing at the airport, with a fire in the cargo hold. Shortly after landing, the fire spread rapidly to the rear section. The pilots evacuated quickly and there were no injuries. The aircraft was a total loss due to the severe fire.

==Access==
The airport is located from downtown São Paulo.


===Car===
The airport has its own highway system: The Rodovia Hélio Smidt Highway which connects the airport to the Presidente Dutra Highway or the Ayrton Senna Highway. Residents of Guarulhos can access the road via Monteiro Lobato Avenue. Taxi stands are located outside each of the two terminals on the Arrivals level; inside there are car rental agency representatives.

===Bus===
Bus transportation is available through the Airport Bus Service, an executive bus line, administered by EMTU and operated by Consórcio Internorte – Área 3. This service provides transportation connecting Guarulhos to Congonhas airport; to Tietê Bus Terminal; to Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal, to Faria Lima Ave; To Republica Square (Praça da República); To Berrini Ave., Itaim Bibi district; and to the circuit of hotels along Paulista Avenue and Rua Augusta. The ride takes about one hour, depending on traffic. At the airport, tickets can be purchased at the counter located outside the lounge of the Terminal 1, Wing B&#x27;s arrivals level.

Pássaro Marron/EMTU, a syndicate of the Internorte Consortium, offers two regular bus lines, 257 and 299, connecting Tatuapé subway station (Line 3-Red) with Guarulhos Airport every 30 minutes. At Tatuapé, both buses can be picked up on a platform of that multimodal station&#x27;s North side bus terminal. At the airport, the stop for both buses is at the Arrivals level road connecting the wings of Terminal 2.

Gol Airlines and LATAM offer for their passengers free bus transfers between Guarulhos and Congonhas airports at regular times.

Viação Cometa offers daily departures to and from the airport and the cities of Santos, Sorocaba, São Vicente, and Praia Grande. Lirabus operates daily buses between the airport and Campinas. Pássaro Marron offers bus services to São José dos Campos with departures every two hours. Viação Transdutra connects the airport with the city of Arujá.

===Rail===

Line 13-Jade of the São Paulo commuter rail system, operated by CPTM, connects with the airport through Aeroporto-Guarulhos Station. This line started its operations experimentally on March 31, 2018. The line was opened initially on a trial phase and operates only on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with trains every 30 minutes to the suburban station of Engenheiro Goulart in eastern São Paulo city, from where a further connection with CPTM&#x27;s line 12 and at least another one by subway will be necessary to reach downtown and the main business areas. Service will be expanded in May 2018 to seven days a week, but still only from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Full service from 4 a.m. to midnight is expected in late June 2018.

Additionally, since December 2020 there&#x27;s the Airport Express service, from Luz station to Aeroporto-Guarulhos, departing from each termini station every hour. It attends only one station towards Aeroporto-Guarulhos (Guarulhos-CECAP station), and 2 stations towards Luz (Guarulhos-CECAP and Brás).

Aeroporto-Guarulhos station is opposite to Terminal 1, which is Guarulhos Airport&#x27;s smallest and least busy, and not linked to the other terminals except by a shuttle bus. The GRU Airport company reportedly vetoed a station closer to much busier Terminals 2 and 3 because it intended to build a shopping mall at the proposed location. The excessive number of train changes through crowded commuter rail and subway lines, and the added inconvenience of the requirement for a shuttle bus, has attracted criticism to the São Paulo state government, responsible for São Paulo&#x27;s subway and commuter rail systems, which has been accused of flawed planning and overindulgence with the airport&#x27;s private concessionaire.

To solve this situation, Governor João Doria and State Secretary of Metropolitan Transports Alexandre Baldy proposed a people mover to connect the CPTM station directly to the airport, estimated to be opened in May 2021. However, many delays prevented the construction of the line, which should be owned and fully operated by GRU Airport. In November 2020, the Brazilian federal government, through the Ministry of Infrastructure, authorized the construction of the people mover, which should cost R$ 175 million (approximately US$ 47.7 million in 2019).

In December 2020 it was announced that Brazilian firm Aerom, which owns the Aeromovel technology, had been selected to install the system. Construction was due to begin in January 2021 with completing in 2022. In June 2021 it was announced that the project had &#x27;advanced&#x27; but a schedule for construction had not been finalised.

<text>Kim Anand Thayil (born September 4, 1960) is an American musician best known as the lead guitarist of the Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden, which he co-founded with singer Chris Cornell and bassist Hiro Yamamoto in 1984. Cornell and Thayil remained as the original members of the band until Cornell&#x27;s death in 2017, and the band&#x27;s subsequent split in 2018. Thayil was named the 100th greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2010, and the 67th greatest guitarist of all time by SPIN in 2012. Thayil has won two Grammy Awards as a member of Soundgarden.

==Biography==
===Childhood and early life===
Born in Seattle, Washington in 1960, Thayil grew up in the Chicago suburb of Park Forest. His parents came from the state of Kerala in India to Seattle. His mother was a music teacher who studied to be a concert pianist at the Royal Academy of Music. His father earned a degree in chemical engineering, received employment in Chicago and moved there with his family.

Thayil started writing lyrics at 12 years old. In 1977, he formed his first band in Chicago, Bozo and the Pinheads, a punk rock band. They did both original songs (written by Thayil and inspired by his punk music tastes) and cover tunes (mostly Sex Pistols, Devo, and Ramones). Their first gig was at a school talent show for an audience of about 500 people.

He played guitar in a post-punk band called Identity Crisis in 1980 and released a 7-inch EP called &quot;Pretty Feet&quot;.

Thayil met Hiro Yamamoto at Rich East High School in Park Forest. He graduated, along with Hiro Yamamoto, from the Active Learning Process School (ALPS) at Rich East High School in 1979, the same school Bruce Pavitt graduated from two years earlier, in 1977. He and Yamamoto decided to move to Olympia, Washington, to study at The Evergreen State College, but they were unable to find jobs and decided to move to Seattle. There, Thayil earned money as a DJ for KCMU and earned a degree in philosophy at the University of Washington. In Seattle they also met Chris Cornell, a roommate, and the three formed Soundgarden in 1984.

===Soundgarden (1984–1997)===
Soundgarden became the first of Seattle&#x27;s grunge bands to sign with a major label (A&amp;M Records). They went on to release five albums, including three which went platinum at least once, and won two Grammys.

Thayil became acclaimed for his guitar work, which was typically characterized by heavy riffing, and was cited among other grunge guitarists as an influence and a pioneer of the &quot;Seattle Sound.&quot; In 1994, Thayil commented, &quot;I think Soundgarden is a pretty good band and I&#x27;m a fine guitarist. I&#x27;m not God, but I&#x27;m certainly not average. I feel very comfortable with the fact that not many other people can do what I do on guitar. I think my guitar is happy with the way I play it.&quot;

Originally one of Soundgarden&#x27;s main songwriters, Thayil&#x27;s contributions as a writer eventually dwindled to just one song on &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot;, although he contributed to details in every song, as did every band member. Thayil explained that &quot;Collaboration was paramount in our early music, especially right at the beginning when it was me on guitar, Hiro on bass and Chris on drums&quot;, but eventually all four members became songwriters of their own, &quot;all writing guitar parts that I had to learn.&quot; This led him to do &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot; all on his own, as Thayil thought &quot;Well, if I&#x27;m going to have a song on this fucking record, I&#x27;m going to have to write lyrics.&quot;

While a member of Soundgarden, he has written the following songs for the band:

* &quot;Hunted Down&quot; (&quot;Screaming Life&quot;) &quot;... music&quot;
* &quot;Nothing to Say&quot; (&quot;Screaming Life&quot;) &quot;... music&quot;

===Post-Soundgarden (1997–2010)===
Thayil joined singer Johnny Cash, bassist Krist Novoselic of Nirvana and drummer Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains for a cover of Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, featured on the tribute album &quot;Twisted Willie&quot;, released in January 1996.

After the 1997 breakup of Soundgarden, Thayil went on to contribute guitar to work by Pigeonhed and Presidents of the United States of America. More recently, he contributed guitar to the track &quot;Blood Swamp&quot; from the 2006 Sunn O)))/Boris album Altar, for which he also wrote liner notes. Thayil also plays lead guitar on a track called &quot;V.O.G.&quot; by Ascend, which features Gentry Densley (Iceburn, Eagle Twin) and Greg Anderson (Sunn O))), Engine Kid, Goatsnake). Ascend&#x27;s record, titled Ample Fire Within, was released in 2008 by Southern Lord Records.

In 1999, Thayil formed a punk band, the No WTO Combo, with Jello Biafra (formerly of Dead Kennedys), Krist Novoselic (formerly of Nirvana, at the time a member of Sweet 75), and Gina Mainwal (also of Sweet 75). The band was formed to celebrate and further the rampant protest activity against the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, which was held on November 30, 1999. Originally scheduled to play at The Showbox on that same evening, police prevented the band from doing so, forcing the show to be rescheduled for the following night. This was Thayil&#x27;s first live concert since the breakup of Soundgarden. The show was recorded by Mark Cavener and mixed by Soundgarden producer Jack Endino; it was released as the album &quot;Live from the Battle in Seattle&quot; in May 2000.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Thayil #100 on the list of the &quot;100 greatest guitarists of all time&quot;.

In 2004, Thayil played guitar for Probot, Dave Grohl&#x27;s heavy metal side-project; he was featured on the songs &quot;Ice Cold Man&quot; and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.

Thayil was a recurring participant on the &quot;Almost Live!&quot; sketch comedy show, calling things &quot;lame&quot; during &quot;The Lame List&quot; segments.

In 2009, Thayil played with Soundgarden&#x27;s Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd at a show in Seattle on March 24, 2009, at the Crocodile Cafe that was headlined by Tom Morello&#x27;s The Nightwatchman. It was the first time the three had played together in public since the band&#x27;s 1997 breakup. The three were joined by Tad Doyle of fellow 1990s Seattle band TAD, and performed three Soundgarden songs. For the last song (Spoonman) they were joined by Tom Morello (Morello had played the song before with Audioslave). Thayil has also played with Greg Gilmore of Mother Love Bone and Danny Kelly of Heliotroupe in the group Set &amp; Setting. Their debut performance was October 31, 2009, above the famed K Records warehouse now known as the Cherry Street Loft (&quot;The Loft on Cherry&quot;) in Olympia, Washington.

===Soundgarden reunion (2010–2018)===

On January 1, 2010, it was announced through Facebook and Twitter posts by Chris Cornell that the official Soundgarden fanclub had been restarted. On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Soundgarden would play its first show since 1997 the following day at the Showbox at the Market in its Seattle hometown. The band played under the name &#x27;Nudedragons&#x27;, an anagram for Soundgarden.

On August 5, 2010, the band played their first reunion show under the Soundgarden name at The Vic Theatre in Chicago. Three days later, they headlined the final night of Lollapalooza in Grant Park.

In September 2010, the band released the compilation album &quot;Telephantasm&quot;. November 2012 saw the release of &quot;King Animal&quot;, their first studio album since 1996.

In 2012, Thayil voiced a character in Season IV: Church of the Black Klok&#x27;s &quot;Dethcamp&quot; in the Adult Swim original series &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;.

On May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room, cancelling the rest of their tour and the band was disbanded again in 2018, with the exception of their one-off show of Tribute to Chris Cornell in January 2019.

In March 2018, it was announced that original member of the proto punk band MC5, Wayne Kramer would embark on a 35 date tour of North America for their 50th anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, recruiting Thayil to play guitar along with Brendan Canty of Fugazi, Doug Pinnick of King&#x27;s X, and Marcus Durant of Zen Guerrilla.

=== Projects outside Soundgarden ===
In 2020, Thayil played guitar solos on the song &quot;The Firebird&quot; for the jazz fusion band, the Barret Martin Group. In 2021, he played lead guitar and Matt Cameron played drums for a track, &quot;Only Love Can Save Me Now&quot;, on the new The Pretty Reckless album. The Pretty Reckless frontwoman Taylor Momsen said that without Thayil, recording the track would have been impossible, as &quot;Kim is a master – there&#x27;s no-one else like him.&quot; In December 2020, Thayil, Krist Novoselic, Jennifer Johnson, Jillian Raye, Jeff Fielder and Ben Smith performed the song &quot;Drone&quot; at the Seattle Museum of Pop Culture&#x27;s tribute to Alice in Chains. In 2021, Thayil appeared on Mastodon&#x27;s double album &quot;Hushed and Grim&quot;, playing lead guitar on the track &quot;Had It All&quot;. 

In 2021, Thayil, along with drummer Matt Cameron, bassist Krist Novoselic, guitarist Bubba Dupree, and vocalists Jennifer Johnson and Jillian Raye, formed the group 3rd Secret. Their self-titled debut album, which they recorded at The Bait Shop in Bellevue, Washington with producer Jack Endino, was released in April 2022. The group also performed at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.

<doc id="719078" wikidata="Q4457027" url="?curid=719078" title="P. T. Selbit">
<text>P. T. Selbit (1881–1938) was an English magician, inventor and writer who is credited with being the first person to perform the illusion of sawing a woman in half. Among magicians he was known for his inventiveness and entrepreneurial instinct and he is credited with creating a long list of successful stage illusions.

==Early life and career==
His birth name was Percy Thomas Tibbles and he was born in Hampstead, London. He developed an interest in magic in his youth, when he was apprenticed to a silversmith. The basement of the silversmith&#x27;s shop was leased to magician and inventor Charles Morritt who used it to develop new tricks and the young Tibbles would sneak in to study these when Morritt was away. Tibbles began doing a coin and card manipulation act under the stage name P. T. Selbit, which he created by spelling his last name backwards and dropping one of the &quot;B&quot;s. He also used Selbit as a pen name, working as a journalist for a theatrical paper, writing a magic handbook and editing a trade journal for magicians.

Between 1902 and 1908, Selbit worked in music halls under the name Joad Heteb. He had deduced audiences wanted something that seemed exotic so he donned greasepaint, robes and a wig to perform as a &quot;pseudo-Egyptian&quot; character. This episode reflects two characteristics that marked much of his magic career: inventive ability and an entrepreneurial desire to keep pulling in audiences with something new. In 1910 Selbit toured with an illusion titled &quot;Spirit Paintings&quot;, in which audience members were asked to name an artist and then pictures in the style of that artist mysteriously appeared on illuminated canvases. His next tour featured a trick called &quot;The Mighty Cheese&quot;, in which audience members were invited to try to tip over a huge circular model of a cheese wheel, which they found impossible to do because it contained a gyroscope.

In 1912 Selbit began working for John Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant, who had come to dominate the business of magic shows in Britain with their productions at the Egyptian Hall and St George&#x27;s Hall. Selbit&#x27;s first role with Maskelyne and Devant was to tour music halls and American vaudeville during 1912 and 1913 presenting Devant&#x27;s &quot;Window of a Haunted House&quot; illusion. In 1914 Selbit introduced the &quot;Walking through a Wall&quot; illusion at St. George&#x27;s Hall.

In 1919, Selbit staged a séance at his own flat in Bloomsbury in London. The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle who attended the séance was unaware of the trickery and declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine.

==Correspondence with Harry Houdini==

Selbit had performed an illusion known as &quot;Walking Through a Brick Wall&quot; at St. George&#x27;s Hall, London in 1913. The American magician Harry Houdini had performed the illusion a year later at Hammerstein&#x27;s Roof Garden in New York, 1914.

Friends of Selbit in England stated that Houdini had originally observed Selbit perform the illusion in London and had stolen it as his own. Houdini responded by claiming that he had purchased the rights from the owner of the illusion, Sidney Josolyne. Selbit rejected the claims of Josolyne and stated that he was the originator of the illusion, and this caused a dispute with Houdini.

In Selbit&#x27;s illusion, an attractive young lady went through the wall. This was different than Houdini&#x27;s illusion as he had gone through the wall himself. The illusion worked by use of a trapdoor that went underneath the wall.

==Sawing through a woman==

There are many versions of the illusion of sawing through a woman or sawing a woman in half as well as other illusions that are based around that theme. There remains a debate as to the exact origins of the idea, with some suggesting there is a record of it from 1809 or that the idea can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Modern magic inventor Jim Steinmeyer has written that a description of the illusion was published by the great French magician Jean Robert-Houdin in 1858, but Robert-Houdin&#x27;s idea remained just that, a written description of an effect. Selbit is generally recognised as the first magician to perform such a trick on a public stage, which he did at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921. In fact, Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the St. George&#x27;s Hall to try to persuade one of them to book him to perform it.

In Selbit&#x27;s version a female assistant got into a wooden box that was similar in proportion to a coffin but slightly larger. She was secured there by ropes around her wrists, ankles and neck. The box was then closed, obscuring her from view. After the box was placed in a horizontal position, Selbit sawed through the middle of it with a large hand saw. The impression given to the audience was that, because of the restraints and limited room in the box, the assistant&#x27;s waist must have been in the path of the saw and she would surely have been cut through. Finally the box was opened and the assistant, still with ropes attached, was revealed as unharmed.

The impact of the illusion was immense and Selbit became a box office hit. Jim Steinmeyer attributes the success and influence of the illusion not just to Selbit&#x27;s inventiveness but also to his timing. By 1920 the world was tiring of older styles of magic. The changes to the public psyche wrought by the trauma of the First World War together with rapid social and technological change meant that the time was right for a new and shocking style of magic. The sawing illusion was pivotal in creating the cliché of the pretty female assistant subjected to torture and mutilation by magicians. Before Selbit, male and female assistants had both been used in illusions.

In Victorian times the bulky nature of female clothes often precluded the use of a female assistant in illusions which required a performer to get into a confined space. By 1920, fashions had changed and it became not only acceptable but desirable to have a cast of attractive women displaying shapely limbs. Steinmeyer has noted that, &quot;beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment&quot;.

Other magicians rapidly attempted to emulate and improve upon Selbit&#x27;s trick. Within months, American magician Horace Goldin presented a version in which the assistant&#x27;s head, hands and feet were seen in full view throughout the trick. Goldin was aggressive in the use of legal measures to try to prevent anyone from competing with him. When Selbit arrived in America to tour with his sawing illusion he found that Goldin had registered many possible titles for the act with the Vaudeville Managers&#x27; Protective Agency. Selbit was thus forced to bill his act as &quot;The Divided Woman&quot;, which had less dramatic impact than the idea of sawing through a woman. Selbit tried to sue Goldin for stealing his idea but the action failed when it was ruled that Goldin&#x27;s illusion was sufficiently different.

The sawing illusion went through many developments after Selbit and other performers achieved fame and great commercial success for particular variants. Goldin later produced sawing illusions that dispensed with a covering box and ultimately used a large buzzsaw.

Another variant, which owed something to Selbit&#x27;s original, has been attributed to Alan Wakeling. However Selbit retains his place in history as the first to present a sawing trick, and thus as a figure who shaped popular perceptions of stage illusions for decades.

===Revival===
In the 1990s, the renowned English magician Paul Daniels performed a homage to Selbit on his television series &quot;Secrets&quot;. Describing the origins of the trick, Daniels performs the sawing a woman in half illusion in its original form, in the style of Selbit, also including Selbit&#x27;s development of using panes of glass, giving the effect that the woman also has her head and legs cut off and her body cut in half vertically.

==Subsequent career and illusions==
Following his court battles in America, which effectively prevented him achieving the same level of success there as he had in Britain, Selbit returned home in 1922. He turned his attention to developing new illusions in the hope of creating something that would repeat the impact of sawing. He is credited with devising &quot;Girl/Man without a Middle&quot; (1924), &quot;Through the Eye of a Needle&quot; (1924), &quot;The Million Dollar Mystery&quot;, &quot;Stretching a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Avoiding the Crush&quot;, &quot;Selbit&#x27;s Blocks&quot; and possibly also the &quot;Siberian Chain Escape&quot;. Although some effects were highly ingenious and several were sufficiently successful that they continued to be performed by subsequent generations of magicians, none achieved the fame of sawing.

In 1928 Selbit went to the aid of Morritt, the magician from whom he had surreptitiously learned so much at the start of his career. Morritt had been arrested and charged with &quot;obtaining money under false pretences&quot; as the result of a misunderstanding over the way he was scraping a living from an act titled &quot;Man in a Trance&quot;. Selbit and Will Goldston helped to fund Morritt&#x27;s defence and he was eventually acquitted.

<text>Sing Tao Holdings Limited was a Bermuda-incorporated company, but headquartered in Hong Kong. The company was listed in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The company was a media and property conglomerate until it was dismantled in 2002. After selling the main media business and subsequent takeover in mid-2002, the legal person of the listed company, along with its property business, was renamed Shanghai Ming Yuan Holdings.

Sing Tao Holdings and its predecessor Sing Tao Limited were majority owned by founder Aw Boon Haw, his daughter Sally Aw and other family members for almost 50 years. Facing financial troubles, Sally Aw sold the controlling stake to a private equity fund of Lazard in 1999. It was then acquired by Charles Ho&#x27;s listed company Global China Technology Group in January 2001. However, in mid-2002 it was re-sold to a Chinese private company Ming Yuan Investment Group, but excluding Sing Tao&#x27;s main business: newspaper (as Sing Tao Media Holdings) as well as a hotel in Canada.

In February 2020, the wholly owned subsidiary in Australia was liquidated with over 20 long serving staff made unemployed without notice and their entitlements not paid by the company. Newsagents were pursued for unsold newspapers and not credited for returns.

Around 1991, the group also owned a travel agency, a medical centre, a recording studio and a pharmaceutical company.

==History==
===Predecessor===
====A family-held publisher====
The predecessor of Sing Tao Holdings as a parent company of Sing Tao Group, was Sing Tao Limited, which was incorporated on 22 October 1951 as Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Limited. It replaced &quot;Sing Tao Jih Pao Limited&quot; as the parent company of the group, which the latter was incorporated on 29 June 1938.

It was renamed to Sing Tao Newspapers Limited on 27 May 1972 and Sing Tao Limited on 13 February 1986. At first, the main business of the company was the publisher of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; () and &quot;Sing Tao Wan Pao&quot; ().

According to the Annual Return filed to the Hong Kong Company Registries in 1952, Aw Boon Haw owned 630 out of 1500 shares of the company; other shareholders were his sons (Aw Kow () 60; Aw Swan (), 60; Aw It Haw () 100; Aw Sze Haw () 100), daughters (Sally Aw and Aw Sing () 60 each), nephews (Aw Cheng Chye (), and Aw Cheng Taik (), 60 each) and grandson, daughters and third generation relatives (total 310 shares held by 9 persons), for a total of 18 persons. , son of Aw Boon Haw, who helped the family to found &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, died in January 1951 due to a plane crash. The shareholder structure also making other newspapers that founded by Aw family in other city, did not have any relation with each other as parent company and subsidiary.

Sally Aw also replaced his foster brother Aw Swan as the head of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; in mid-1952, as Aw Swan allegedly borrow money by using his foster father&#x27;s name without his consent. Aw Boon Haw even made a public announcement to renounce his relationship with Aw Swan.

After the death of Aw Boon Haw in 1954, , Aw Cheng Chye, eldest son of Aw Boon Haw&#x27;s brother Aw Boon Par (b.1888, d.1944), was the general manager of Singapore-based Eng Aun Tong, the maker of Tiger Balm, while Sally Aw, became the head of Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Limited, which she was the largest shareholder among the family member. , Sally Aw&#x27;s brother, Aw Kow, was also a director of &quot;Sin Chew Jit Poh&quot; of Singapore and Malaysia; her brother, Aw Swan, was the general manager of &quot;Sin Chew Jit Poh&quot; from June 1971 to circa 1972; while her cousin Aw Cheng Taik was the managing director of &quot;Singapore Tiger Standard&quot; until it was defunct in the 1950s. Widow of Aw Hoe, Chan Sow Yong, also served as an executive of Sing Tao.

, Sally Aw another brother, Aw It Haw still owned a minority stake in Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.), and also served as a director.

Aw Toke Tone, son of Aw Hoe, was the managing director of &quot;Hong Kong Tiger Standard&quot; in 1967.

====Initial public offering and diversification====
The shares of Sing Tao Newspapers Limited () was once traded in Far East Exchange () and Kam Ngan Stock Exchange () from 1972, the predecessors of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (). The initial public offering price was HK$6. Sing Tao&#x27;s shared was traded in [old] Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited since 1977. Sing Tao&#x27;s listing was only few years behind the listing of Haw Par Brothers International, a Singapore company held by Singapore-based branch of Aw family. Moreover, the publisher of &quot;Hong Kong Tiger Standard&quot; was changed from &quot;The Tiger Standard Limited&quot; to &quot;Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Limited&quot; circa early 1970s (the latter was incorporated on 28 August 1970). The former was owned by Aw family directly but the latter was a subsidiary of Sing Tao Newspapers Limited in the late 1970s for 55% shares. It was owned by Aw Toke Tone (), the eldest son of the late Aw Hoe for about 90% in 1970.

In October 1972, it was announced that a subsidiary (provisional Chinese name ) was formed to invest in real estate. The group purchased a land lease on 838 Lai Chi Kok Road, Kowloon (New Kowloon Inland Lot No.5567) to build a printing factory and commercial floor area for lease in 1974. In 1977, it was announced that the group had formed its own recording studio and photography processing centre that open to retail customers.

According to 1977–78 result announcement, Sing Tao Group had also expanded into travel agency, medical centre and pharmaceutical industry. By 1979, Sing Tao operated their printing and publishing business as ), as well as Leefung-Asco&#x27;s joint venture South China Printing Co., Ltd. Sing Tao also invested 49% stake in a documentary studio Farkas Studios in 1979.

====Privatization and second IPO====
In 1985, the company was privatised by Sally Aw via an Australian-listed company Cereus Australia for a reported price HK$13 per share (HK$11.5 cash and 1 share of Cinclus.) However, shares owned by Aw family members would only receive HK$9 per share (HK$7.5 cash and 1 share of Cinclus). The deal also made Cinclus had a wide shareholders base to apply for listing as a replacement of Sing Tao.

Sing Tao and now independent listed company (ex-Cinclus), via an investment vehicle Scilla Limited, made a high-profile purchase on a land lease (Kowloon Inland Lot No.10722) in Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon in October 1985. The newspaper credited the land lease was the &quot;Land King of Canton Road&quot; (). The price was HK$630 million (HK$705 per gross floor area). It was reported that the consortium had re-sold the land lease to other real estate developer in 1986, which the location was now known as Lippo Sun Plaza, The Sun Arcade and a hotel, The Langham (Hong Kong).

However, less than a year of privatisation, Sing Tao Newspapers Limited was renamed to Sing Tao Limited (); the company started another IPO in 1986 and traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 19 March of the same year. It was reported that 75% shares were old shares that was sold by Cereus Australia&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary Cereus Newspapers (Hong Kong) Limited and only 25% were new shares.

In 1987, Sally Aw owned 101,385,026 number of shares directly while her nephew Aw Toke Tone owned 216,000 directly; they did not owned any of the subsidiaries of Sing Tao Limited, including &quot;Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Limited&quot; which Aw Toke Tone owned a minority stake in the late 1970s to 1984.

===Sing Tao Holdings===
Circa 1989 a Bermuda-incorporated company Sing Tao Holdings Limited replaced Sing Tao Limited as the holding company of the group. At the same time, Cereus Australia, the investment vehicle Aw used to privatise Sing Tao in 1985, was delisted on the Australian Securities Exchange in the same year by Kargat Pty Limited. The ex-parent company was engaged in property investment in Sydney.

According to a book published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, citing a document that Sing Tao Holdings was a diversified conglomerate already in 1989, which only 7.7% revenue was from the newspaper despite 50% investments were newspaper related.

The company published the &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, the oldest surviving Chinese language daily newspaper in Hong Kong, which is also published overseas editions in New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, London, Paris, Sydney and Melbourne. The first edition was published in 1938.

It also published the English business newspaper &quot;The Standard&quot; in Hong Kong.

Sing Tao also published the evening edition of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, known as &quot;Sing Tao Wan Pao&quot; (). The version discontinued in 1996.

The company also operates several printing businesses, most notably the South China Printing Company (1988) Limited.

Sing Tao Sports Club Limited, a professional football club founded by Sally Aw and Hsu King Shing (the coach of Sing Tao SC before its incorporation), was later owned by Sing Tao Limited and Wong Yue Kai (an accountant of Sing Tao Holdings). The paid-in share capital of the club was remained unchanged for many year for just HK$200.

In 1990s Sing Tao Holdings also acquired another listed company Jademan Holdings (a new Bermuda-incorporated parent company was found in 1993 to replace Jademan Holdings as the listed company) Jademan Holdings was the publisher of another newspaper &quot;Tin Tin Daily News&quot;. Culturecom Holdings was sold in 1998 to . A subsidiary, Sing Tao Newspapers (Canada 1988) Limited, was also turned to a 50–50 joint venture between Sing Tao Holdings and Toronto Star Newspapers Limited in the same year. Toronto Star Newspapers also acquired 75% stake of Canada-incorporated Sing Tao Daily Limited, the publisher of Canada edition.

====Sing Tao management found guilty of fudging circulation numbers====

In 1998, members of the management team were found guilty of falsifying circulation numbers for &quot;The Standard&quot; newspaper, to attract advertisers and to raise the revenue of the newspapers. According to a report by the Center for International Media Assistance, the circulation of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; and most major Beijing-friendly Chinese newspapers with overseas editions were remain unaudited, and therefore vulnerable to exaggeration:
&quot;The Standard&quot; were audited by Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited as of 2012.

The case, later known as &quot;Hongkong Standard case&quot; or &quot;Sally Aw case&quot; () was criticised by the public by not suing Sally Aw, the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings. Chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, in the &quot;Report on the key issues during the second year of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; made a defence for decision of the Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung.

However, Tung Chee-chen, brother of Tung Chee-hwa, was an independent non-executive director of Sing Tao Holdings since December 1996, while Tung Chee-hwa also served the same position in the 1980s to the 1990s. It was reported that Tung Chee-hwa was a family friend of Sally Aw.

====Takeover and dismantle====
As of 1998, the company was still owned by Sally Aw, the daughter of the founder of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; for 50.04%. It was reported that Aw agreed to sell 23% shares of the company, to Dublin-listed private equity fund China Enterprise Development Fund for a reported HK$115.8 million (HK$1.20 per share) in December 1998. However, Lazard Asia won the final bid to become the controlling shareholder for a reported HK$269 million (HK$1.25 per share). According to Charles Ho who bought Sing Tao Holdings in 2001 from Lazard, also made an attempt to buy Sing Tao, but collapsed. However, Cha denied any formal agreement was signed. Ho&#x27;s grandfather Ho Ying-chie, also filed a bankruptcy petition against Aw in January 1999. According to Ho Ying-chie, he had lent Aw HK$270 million. According to a reporter, Cha&#x27;s listed company did announce a deal with Aw to form a new holding company for Sing Tao Holdings in May 1998, but the deal collapsed in June.

During Lazard as the major shareholder, Hong Kong banker Cheung Din Youn (, brother of Barry Cheung) was the chairman and Charles Ho was the honorary chairman and an independent non-executive director.

In mid-1999, Sing Tao SC stopped its operation as a football club. The legal entity of the company was used for other business in 2010 as Sing Tao Media Services, by its new owner Sing Tao News Corporation after many years of dormant.

In 2000, Sing Tao Holdings re-launched &quot;The Standard&quot; in tabloid format.

In January 2001, Global China Technology Group, majority owned by Charles Ho, acquired approximately 51.36% shares of Sing Tao Holdings from Astral Light Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Lazard Asia Fund A, L.P., for HK355.6 million (HK$1.65 per share).

In January 2002 South China Printing, Noble World Printing, Roman Financial Press, Valiant Packaging Holdings and their subsidiaries were sold from Sing Tao Holdings to Asia Printers Group for HK$428 million; Asia Printers Group was owned by CVC Capital Partners and Citigroup.

In August 2002 the shares of Sing Tao Holdings that held by Global China Technology Group (74.5%), was sold to a private company Ming Yuan Investment Group for HK163.8 million (HK$0.524 per share). Ming Yuan Investment Group was owned by Yao Yuan (). However, the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings, a subsidiary of Sing Tao Holdings, were distributed to the shareholders of Sing Tao Holdings before the takeover by Yao. Global China Technology Group offered to the public shareholders of Sing Tao Media Holdings after the transaction, to buy the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings by offering the shares of Global China Technology Group, in a ratio of 1 to 1.75. The deal making the shareholder of Sing Tao Holdings at that time, would owned the shares of both Shanghai Ming Yuan Holdings (ex-Sing Tao Holdings) and Global China Technology Group if they did not sell the shares before the transactions.

The residual assets at the 2002 takeover was mainly property investment such as properties in Saba Road, Richmond, British Columbia and in Wyndham Place, Hong Kong. However, it excluded Colony Hotel in Toronto.

<text>The FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking is a ranking system for men&#x27;s national teams in association football, led by Argentina . The men&#x27;s teams of the member nations of FIFA, football&#x27;s world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest time ranked first.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches. The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. Since 16 August 2018, the ranking system has adopted the Elo rating system used in chess and Go.

The ranking is sponsored by Coca-Cola; as such, the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking name is also used. Coca-Cola also sponsors the women&#x27;s counterpart.

==History==
In December 1992, FIFA first published a listing in rank order of its men&#x27;s member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. From the following August, this list was more frequently updated, to be published most months. Significant changes were implemented in January 1999 and again in July 2006, as a reaction to criticisms of the system. Historical records of the rankings, such as listed at FIFA.com, reflect the method of calculation in use at the time, as the current method has not been applied retrospectively to rankings before July 2006. Membership of FIFA has expanded from 167 to 211 since the rankings began; 211 members are currently included in the rankings. The Cook Islands were temporarily removed from the ranking in the period from September 2019 until February 2022, after not having played any matches between 4 September 2015 until 17 March 2022.

===1992–1998 calculation method===
The ranking formula used from December 1992 until December 1998, was devised by two Swiss lecturers from University of Zurich (Markus Lamprecht and Dr. Hanspeter Stam). The first formula was the most simple one, compared to later revisions, but it still required complex calculation. The main concept was to award points for matches played between all FIFA-affiliated national A teams, based on their results over the past eight years in FIFA-recognised matches (friendly matches, qualifying and finals matches for the World Cup, and qualifying and final matches for a Continental championship):
* 3 points for a win
* 1 point for a draw
* 0 point for a loss
Results were not included from matches played by the FIFA association&#x27;s: B teams, C teams, League XI teams, Women, U17, U20, U23 and futsal teams.

The calculation formula was adjusted by the following factors:
# Points for winning, drawing or losing: Compensatory factors for the relative strength of the two teams involved are included, so that a victory of a lower-ranked team over a higher-ranked team is awarded a higher number of winning-points compared to a victory of a higher-ranked team over a lower-ranked team. Likewise the points from a draw will be higher for the lower-ranked team compared to the higher-ranked team.
# Points for goals scored or conceded: Goals are granted the same number of points whether or not they were scored in ordinary time or extended time. Zero points were granted from goals scored or conceded in a penalty shoot-out. Goals scored by a higher-ranked team against a lower-ranked team was also given slightly fewer points, compared to goals scored by a lower-ranked team against a higher-ranked team. Moreover, it was decided that the first goal scored by a team would be awarded more points compared to the subsequently scored goals in the same match. The total number of points from goals being scored or conceded, would be of such small scale, that the points awarded from the match result (winning/drawing) would always be of a higher value.
# Bonus points for away matches: Regardless of the final match result, the away team is given 0.3 extra points for playing a match away from home. There will be no away bonus points for the teams, if the match is played on neutral grounds.
# Multiplying factors for various competitions: The importance of the match will affect the points awarded to the teams, so that the sum of points granted through the first three rules mentioned above, will be multiplied by the following factors:
## Friendly matches: × 1.00
## Qualifier for Continental championship: × 1.10
## Qualifier for World Cup: × 1.25
## Finals of Continental championship: × 1.25
## Finals of World Cup: × 1.50
# Regional strengths and weaknesses: Regional strength is finally also factored into the award of points. In matches between teams from different continents, the granted points are multiplied by a factor of 1.0. In matches between teams from the same continent, the granted points will be multiplied by a factor of: 1.0 for European and South American teams, 0.9 for African and North+Central American teams, 0.8 for Asian &amp; Oceanian teams.
# Overall resulting in this FIFA Rank calculation formula: (Sum of points from rule 1+2+3) * Rule4 Factor * Rule5 Factor, calculated for each recognized match played in the past eight years, with the total number of ranking points being the sum of points calculated for those matches.

In example, despite being undefeated for all matches played in 1994, the world ranking of England still dropped seven places from December 1993 to December 1994, because the team only scored points from six lower factored friendly games (as per rule 4). England did not play a single competitive match in 1994, because they had failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup and neither played qualifiers for the UEFA Euro 1996 as an automatically qualified host.

The calculated results for the rankings published throughout 1992–1998, was at some point of time also rounded to the nearest integer by the official FIFA website, although other websites opted to publish the unrounded points of the ranking.

===1999–2006 calculation method===

In January 1999, FIFA introduced a revised system of ranking calculation, incorporating many changes in response to criticism of inappropriate rankings. For the ranking all matches, their scores and importance were all recorded, and were used in the calculation procedure. Only matches for the senior men&#x27;s national team were included. Separate ranking systems were used for other representative national sides such as women&#x27;s and junior teams, for example the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings. The women&#x27;s rankings were, and still are, based on a procedure which is a simplified version of the Football Elo Ratings.

The major changes were as follows:
* the point ranking was scaled up by a factor of ten
* the method of calculation was changed to take into account factors including:
** the number of goals scored or conceded
** whether the match was played at home or away
** the importance of a match or competition
** regional strength
* a fixed number of points were no longer necessarily awarded for a victory or a draw
* match losers were able to earn points

A contemporary website, described the 1999-revision of the calculation formula to be something that &quot;slightly modified and more finely tuned the tried and tested method of calculation&quot;, with the most impactful revisions being that from now on only the seven best matches annually are taken into account (removing the previous advantage of playing additional matches) along with an adjustment of the regional strength factors for confederations and the match importance factors for various competitions.

The new ranking system continued the practice of the previous one, to annually grant the awards:
*Team of the Year
*Best Mover of the Year

The changes made the ranking system more complex, but helped improve its accuracy by making it more comprehensive.

===2006–2018 calculation method===

FIFA announced that the ranking system would be updated following the 2006 World Cup. The evaluation period was cut from eight to four years, and a simpler method of calculation was used to determine rankings. Goals scored and home or away advantage were no longer taken into account, and other aspects of the calculations, including the importance attributed to different types of match, were revised. The first set of revised rankings and the calculation methodology were announced on 12 July 2006.

This change was rooted at least in part in widespread criticism of the previous ranking system. Many football enthusiasts felt it was inaccurate, especially when compared to other ranking systems and that it was not sufficiently responsive to changes in the performance of individual teams.

===2018 ranking system update===
In September 2017, FIFA announced they were reviewing the ranking system and would decide after the end of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification whether any changes would be made to improve the ranking. FIFA announced on 10 June 2018 that the ranking system would be updated following the 2018 World Cup finals. The calculation method adopted closely modelled the Elo rating system (see calculation method). The weighting designated for each confederation for ranking purposes was abolished. The new methodology does not account for home or away games and margin of the victory, as in several popular unofficial Elo-based ranking systems.

FIFA had intended to introduce the new ranking system in July 2018, but with no matches scheduled between the July and August ranking dates, delayed until August 2018. There was speculation from football journalists such as ESPN&#x27;s Dale Johnson that this was because projections of the new rankings had seen relatively little change in positions, with Germany – who had been eliminated in the first round of the World Cup – remaining as the top ranked team. FIFA had originally planned to use existing world ranking points from June 2018 as the start value, but when the August rankings appeared, the starting points had been changed to an equal distribution of points between 1600 (Germany, as the previously top ranked team) and 868 (Anguilla, Bahamas, Eritrea, Somalia, Tonga and Turks and Caicos Islands, which had 0 points in June), according to the formula:

:formula_1,

where R is the rank in June 2018. When two or more teams had equal ranks, the following team received the next immediate rank possible, e.g. if two teams had R=11, the following team had R=12, not 13. Then the rating changes according to the games played after previous release were calculated. This produced a more dramatically altered ranking table, with Germany falling to 15th and 2018 World Cup champions France moving to the top of the ranking.

===2021 alteration===
Starting with the April 2021 rankings, the teams&#x27; points are now rounded to two decimal points, instead of being rounded to the nearest integer.

==Leaders==
 FIFA World Men&#x27;s Ranking Leaders

When the system was introduced, Germany debuted as the top-ranked team following their extended period of dominance in which they had reached the three previous FIFA World Cup finals, winning one of them. Brazil took the lead in the run up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup after winning eight and losing only one of nine qualification matches, while on the way scoring twenty goals and conceding just four. Italy then led for a short time on the back of their own equally successful World Cup qualifying campaign, after which the top place was re-claimed by Germany.

Brazil&#x27;s success in their lengthy qualifying campaign returned them to the lead for a brief period. Germany led again during the 1994 World Cup, until Brazil&#x27;s victory in that competition gave them a large lead that would stand up for nearly seven years, until they were surpassed by a strong France team that captured both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 European Football Championship.

Success at the 2002 FIFA World Cup restored Brazil to the top position, where they remained until February 2007, when Italy returned to the top for the first time since 1993 following their 2006 FIFA World Cup win in Germany. Just one month later, Argentina replaced them, reaching the top for the first time, but Italy regained its place in April. After winning the Copa América 2007 in July, Brazil returned to the top, but were replaced by Italy in September and then Argentina in October.

In July 2008, Spain took over the lead for the first time, having won UEFA Euro 2008. Brazil began a sixth stint at the top of the rankings in July 2009 after winning the 2009 Confederations Cup, and Spain regained the title in November 2009 after winning every match in qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In April 2010, Brazil returned to the top of the table. After winning the 2010 World Cup, Spain regained the top position and held it until August 2011, when the Netherlands reached the top spot for the first time, only to relinquish it the following month.

In July 2014, Germany took over the lead once again, having won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In July 2015, Argentina reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching the final of both the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2015 Copa America. In November 2015, Belgium became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Belgium led the rankings until April 2016, when Argentina returned to the top. In April 2017, Brazil returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time since 2010, with Germany regaining the top spot in July after winning the Confederations Cup.

In August 2018, FIFA updated their rating system by adopting the Elo rating system, with 2018 FIFA World Cup winners France regaining the top spot for the first time after nearly 16 years. One month later, for the first time, two teams were joint leaders as Belgium reached the same ranking as France. This lasted only one month, as Belgium regained sole possession of the top spot in October 2018 and kept it for nearly four years (only Brazil and Spain have had longer continuous streaks). 

The current leader is 2022 FIFA World Cup winner Argentina, since April 2023.

==Ranking schedule==
Rankings are published multiple times a year. The next update is scheduled for 3 April 2025.

==Uses of the rankings==
The rankings are used by FIFA to rank the progression and ability of the national football teams of its member nations, and claims that they create &quot;a reliable measure for comparing national A-teams&quot;. They are used as part of the calculation, or the entire grounds to seed competitions. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament, the rankings were used to seed the groups in the competitions involving CONCACAF members (using the May rankings), CAF (with the July set of data), and UEFA, using the specially postponed November 2007 ranking positions.

The October 2009 ranking was used to determine the seeds for the 2010 FIFA World Cup final draw.
The March 2011 ranking was used to seed the draw for the 2012 CAF Men&#x27;s Pre-Olympic Tournament second qualifying round.

The rankings are also used to determine the winners of the two annual awards national teams receive on the basis of their performance in the rankings.

The Football Association uses the average of the last 24 months of rankings as one of the criteria for player work permits.

==Special releases==
To determine the seeding of teams in certain instances like FIFA World Cup qualification, FIFA occasionally releases a list of special rankings for a particular confederation to determine the seeding of the teams. For instance, the seeding for the third round draw for AFC qualifiers was based on a special release of the FIFA World Rankings for Asian teams on 18 June 2021.

==Criticism of pre-2018 methods==
Since their introduction in 1992, the FIFA World Rankings have been the subject of much debate, particularly regarding the calculation procedure and the resulting disparity between generally perceived quality and world ranking of some teams. The perceived flaws in the FIFA system have led to the creation of a number of alternative rankings from football statisticians.

The initial system was very simple, with no weighting for the quality of opponent or importance of a match. This saw Norway reach second in October 1993 and July–August 1995, a ranking that was criticised at the time. The rankings were adapted in 1999 to include weightings based on the importance of the match and the strength of the opponent. A win over a weak opponent resulted in fewer points being awarded than a win over a much stronger one. Further adaptations in 2006 were made to reduce the number of years&#x27; results considered from 8 to 4, with greater reliance on matches from within the previous 12 months.

Still, criticisms of the rankings remained, with particular anomalies being noted including: the United States rise to fourth in 2006, to the surprise of even their own players; Israel&#x27;s climb to 15th in November 2008, which surprised the Israeli press; and Belgium&#x27;s rank of world number 1 in November 2015, even though Belgium had only played in one tournament final stage in the past 13 years.

Further criticisms of the 2006–2018 formula included the inability of hosts of major tournaments to retain a high place in the rankings, as the team participated in only lower-value friendly matches due to their automatic qualification for the tournament. For example, 2014 FIFA World Cup hosts Brazil fell to a record low ranking of 22nd in the world before that tournament, at which they then finished fourth. 2018 FIFA World Cup hosts Russia had the lowest ranking (70th) at the tournament, where they reached the quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Croatia on penalties.

In the 2010s, teams realised the ranking system could be &#x27;gamed&#x27;, specifically by avoiding playing non-competitive matches, particularly against weaker opponents. This was because the low weighting of friendlies meant that even victories could reduce a team&#x27;s &quot;average&quot; score: in other words, a team could win a match and lose points. Before the seeding of the 2018 World Cup preliminary draw, Romania even appointed a ranking consultant, playing only one friendly in the year before the draw. Similar accusations had been made against Switzerland, who were a seeded team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup having played only three friendly matches in the previous year, and Poland before the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

The use of regional strength multiplier in the ranking formula before 2018 was also accused of further reinforcing and perpetuating the bias for and against certain regions.

==Calculation method==
On 10 June 2018, the new ranking system was approved by the FIFA Council. It is based on the Elo rating system and after each game points are added to or subtracted from a team&#x27;s rating according to the formula:

:formula_2
where:

* &quot;P&quot;before – the team&#x27;s number of points before the game
* &quot;I&quot; – the importance coefficient:
** 5 – friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows
** 10 – friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows
** 15 – Nations League matches (group stage)
** 25 – Nations League matches (play-offs and finals), Confederations&#x27; final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers
** 35 – Confederations&#x27; final competitions matches (before quarter-finals)
** 40 – Confederations&#x27; final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later)
** 50 – FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals)
** 60 – FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals, semi-finals, third place play-off and final)
* &quot;W&quot; – the result of the game:
** 0 – loss after regular or extra time
** 0.5 – draw or loss in a penalty shoot-out
** 0.75 – win in a penalty shoot-out
** 1 – win after regular or extra time.
:: If a game ends with a winner, but still requires a penalty shoot-out (PSO) (i.e. in the second game of a two-legged tie), it is considered as a regular game and the PSO is disregarded.
* &quot;We&quot; – the expected result of the game:
::formula_3
:where formula_4 is the difference between two teams&#x27; ratings before the game, and formula_5 is a scale.

Negative points in knockout stages of final competitions do not affect teams&#x27; ratings.

===Analysis of model properties===
The 2018 ranking is a clear improvement over the previous FIFA rankings, and it can be evaluated against well-defined numerical and statistical benchmarks.

====Inflation====

The pure Elo rating is described as a zero-sum game, where the total number of ranking points stays constant: the points gained by the winner are taken away from the losing team. This happens when the results of the game formula_6 are defined in a symmetric manner, i.e., 
formula_7.

However, the above condition is not satisfied in the FIFA ranking in :
* The shootout wins, when formula_8 and formula_9, thus formula_10,
* The knockout stages of competitions where the teams cannot lose the points, i.e. formula_11 is forced to be non-negative, which is the same as increasing of formula_6. Most often, this rule is applied for the losing team, but can be done for the winner in the shootouts when formula_13.

As a consequence, the total number of points slowly grows over time, which is known as the ranking &quot;inflation&quot;. As an example, between June 4, 2018 and March 31, 2022, there were 3,444 FIFA-recognized games, and the initial total value of points equal to 254,680 was increased by 2,099 points (approximately 0.8%) which was due to 24 games with the shootout points applied (but not the knockout), 90 games with the knockout rule (but not the shootout), and 30 games where both rules were applied.

====Probabilistic model====
Since the FIFA ranking is inspired by the Elo rating, it inherits its properties. In particular, the explicit probabilistic model of the game outcomes is not defined, that is, even if the expected result formula_14 is calculated from the difference between the rankings formula_4, the probability of observing the win, the draw or the loss is not specified. This makes difficult the assessment of how well the ranking predicts the future games. 

However, as explained in Elo rating article, it is possible, to infer the implicit probabilistic model used by the algorithm. The obvious advantage of using such a model is that we can calculate the probability of the particular outcome of the game, and, more importantly, adjust the parameters to take into account the frequency of the draws. In the context of international FIFA games, this improves the prediction capacity by 2-3%.

====Home advantage====
Using the inferred probabilistic model, the statistical analysis indicates that introducing the home advantage parameter improves the prediction capacity of the ranking by approximately 3%. 

In fact, this should be uncontroversial because the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Ranking already uses the home advantage parameter H=100 which is added to the ranking of the home team when calculating the ranking difference formula_4. The corresponding coefficient in men&#x27;s ranking should be around H=300.

====Game importance coefficients====
From the statistical perspective, the importance coefficients formula_17, which de facto change the ranking adaptation step, are counterproductive, that is, yield game prediction which are worse when compared to using the same step in all games.

==Awards==
Each year FIFA hands out two awards to its member nations, based on their rankings. They are:

===Team of the Year===
&quot;Team of the Year&quot; is awarded each year to the first ranked team in the December-edition of the FIFA World Ranking. Except in 2000 and 2001, where a different calculation method determined the award instead should be given to: The national team with the highest average points score in their seven best matches of the recent year ended on 31 December.

Argentina are the most recent Team of the Year for the fourth time in the 31-year history of the rankings. Brazil hold the records for most consecutive wins (seven, between 1994 and 2000) and most wins overall (thirteen). The table shows the three best teams of each year:

====Performances by countries====
===Best Mover of the Year===
The Best Mover of the Year is awarded to the team who made the best progress up the rankings over the course of the year. In the FIFA rankings, this is not simply the team that has risen the most places, but a calculation is performed in order to account for the fact that it becomes progressively harder to earn more points the higher up the rankings a team is.

The calculation done for the years 1993–2006, the era before the major FIFA World ranking calculation revision in July 2006, is the number of points the team has at the end of the year (&quot;z&quot;) multiplied by the number of points it earned during the year (&quot;y&quot;). The team with the highest index on this calculation received the award. The 1993–2006 table shows the top three best movers for each year.

In the years from 1993 until 2006, an official &quot;Best Mover Award&quot; was handed over to the coach of the winning national football team at the annual FIFA World Player Gala. For example, the coach of the Slovenia national football team (Srečko Katanec) received this official award at the &quot;FIFA World Player 1999 Awards Gala&quot;, with the award granted a few days after the year had ended on 24 January 2000. The award has not been an official part of the annual FIFA awards gala show, The Best FIFA Football Awards, since the show for 2006.

While an official award has not been made for national team movements since 2006, FIFA has continued each year to release a list of the &#x27;Best Movers&#x27; in the rankings. An example of the informal on-going &quot;Mover of the Year&quot; award is the recognition made by FIFA to Colombia in 2012 in an official press release.

After implementation of the major FIFA World ranking calculation revision in July 2006, the calculation methodology to decide the &quot;Mover of the Year&quot; ranking also changed in 2007, to simply the difference between the FIFA world ranking points by the end of the year compared to 12 months earlier. The Best Mover results for all subsequent years are based on the same methodology.

<doc id="719096" wikidata="Q335579" url="?curid=719096" title="Omar Rodríguez-López">
<text>Omar Alfredo Rodríguez-López (born September 1, 1975) is a Puerto Rican guitarist, songwriter, record producer and filmmaker. He has formed or played in several bands, including The Mars Volta, At the Drive-In, Antemasque, and Bosnian Rainbows. He was the bassist for the dub band De Facto. He has embarked on a solo career, both in studio and in concert, frequently described as experimental, avant-garde, or progressive. He has also collaborated with numerous artists, such as Damo Suzuki, John Frusciante, El-P, Mon Laferte and Calle 13.

==Early life==
Rodríguez-López was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in El Paso, Texas, and spent some of his childhood in South Carolina. He began playing the bass at age 12, but then switched to guitar at 15 because he &quot;needed more strings&quot;. It was during this time that Rodríguez-López met Cedric Bixler-Zavala while practicing with friend Paul Hinojos. Since then Rodríguez-López has spent most of his career living and working with his close friend Bixler-Zavala. During this time he frequently collaborated with his friends and future bandmates from El Paso, which included people such as Paul Hinojos, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Julio Venegas and the late Jeremy Ward. He attended Coronado High School in El Paso.

== Career ==

=== Startled Calf (1991–1992) ===
Rodríguez-López dropped out of high school at age 17 to go on tour with Startled Calf, an El Paso, Texas, hardcore punk band, as their vocalist, and was left stranded in Berkeley after the rest of the band were arrested. The band formed in 1991 and featured Ralph Jasso on guitar, Jimmy Hernandez on bass, and George Fraska on drums. The band broke up in 1992. Hernandez died of cancer some time after.

===At the Drive-In (1995–2001, 2012, 2016–2018)===

At 17, Rodríguez-López left El Paso to hitchhike around the country for a year in the early 1990s, during which he acquired an addiction to opiates. Eventually he got in touch with friend Cedric Bixler-Zavala who suggested he come back to El Paso. With the help of Bixler-Zavala, he was able to return to El Paso where he could begin to reclaim his life from addiction and join At the Drive-In as backup vocalist and bass guitarist. After receiving a record deal with Flipside Records and recording &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot; with the band, he became their full-time bassist before switching to guitar. After several years and two more critically acclaimed albums, for a variety of reasons, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala left At the Drive-In and the band went on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;. The remaining members, Paul Hinojos, Tony Hajjar, and Jim Ward went on to form Sparta while the duo focused on other projects.

On January 9, 2012, At the Drive-In announced that they were reforming for a tour. The band released their fourth album &quot;In•ter a•li•a&quot; in 2017 before going on an indefinite hiatus in November 2018.

===The Mars Volta (2001–2012, 2019–present)===

They refocused their efforts on the dub outfit called De Facto, which also included Jeremy Ward and Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens, and which they had started years before while still in At the Drive-In. Eventually the same collective of musicians in De Facto would be expanded into Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s new band, The Mars Volta. Once again starting from scratch he wrote and toured with the band which consumed almost all his time and money.

On May 25, 2003, less than a month before the release of their first full-length album, &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, bandmate and close friend Jeremy Ward was found dead of a heroin overdose. This event, coupled with the memories of the suicide of his friend Julio Venegas years earlier, finally convinced both him and Bixler-Zavala to quit using opiates. Since then he has been clean and credited his newfound musical work ethic on his new lifestyle. The Mars Volta&#x27;s second album, &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;, would later be dedicated to Ward.

During the early years of the band he also worked on a low budget movie called &quot;A Manual Dexterity&quot; which starred Jeremy Ward. The soundtrack &quot;A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume 1&quot; was released in 2004. The release of the second volume, which was originally planned for Spring of 2005, and the film were both delayed indefinitely due to legal problems. Conflicts over ownership of certain footage and Rodríguez-López&#x27;s reluctance to revisit the project which featured his late friend Jeremy Ward were both cited as reasons for the delay. However, Rodríguez-López stated that he does intend to release both Volume 2 and the film at some point in the future.

On February 8, 2009, he and his fellow Mars Volta bandmates won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance.

On January 23, 2013, The Mars Volta officially announced that they had broken up, following a series of tweets posted by Cedric Bixler-Zavala stating that he had departed the band. Their future was uncertain at this point, although Rodríguez-López has not ruled out the possibility of reuniting in the future.

On June 18, 2022, The Mars Volta revealed the coordinates to a location in Los Angeles, California, where fans were allowed to preview new music from the band. This was followed up by the release of the single &quot;Blacklight Shine&quot; and a tour announcement, marking both their first new music and first live shows in ten years. The band subsequently announced their first album in 10 years, The Mars Volta, which was released on September 16, 2022.

===Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group (2005–2012, 2018)===

In 2005 Rodríguez-López relocated to Amsterdam, where he eventually wrote and recorded four separate albums. His first solo project was the &quot;Omar Rodríguez-López Quintet&quot;. Rodríguez-López played several live shows in Europe with his quintet, which in 2005 also included three members of The Mars Volta Group (Juan Alderete, Marcel Rodríguez-López and Adrián Terrazas-González) and Money Mark.

The songs featured on this tour later appeared on the album &quot;Omar Rodriguez&quot;. It was characterized by long, improvisational songs with Dutch titles and no lyrics. The Quintet also performed live with Damo Suzuki, parts of which were recorded and incorporated into a 25-minute EP titled &quot;Please Heat This Eventually&quot;, which was released in 2007.

During this time Rodríguez-López was also working on The Mars Volta&#x27;s 2006 record &quot;Amputechture&quot; and composing the score to the film &quot;El Búfalo de la Noche&quot; simultaneously to his work with the quintet.

On May 29, 2007, &quot;Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo&quot; was released. It was the third full-length solo album by Rodríguez-López. It featured performances by Mars Volta members Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marcel Rodríguez-López, Juan Alderete, Adrián Terrazas-González as well as cameos by Money Mark, John Frusciante, and Jon Theodore. It was written and recorded between 2005 and 2006 in California and Amsterdam.

The Quintet later resurfaced in 2007, now known as &quot;The Rodríguez-López Group&quot; to perform on the &quot;white&quot; stage at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan on July 28. Performing with the group for the first time were singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and drummer Thomas Pridgen.

===Solo releases (2004–present)===

On October 8, 2007, the EP &quot;Omar Rodriguez-Lopez &amp; Lydia Lunch&quot;, a collaboration with spoken word poet Lydia Lunch, was released. &quot;The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange&quot; is a double LP featuring the original quintet and was released on vinyl November 20, 2007. It was also released for digital download. &quot;Calibration&quot;, a record that Rodríguez-López recorded during his stay in Amsterdam, was released February 5, 2008. It was described as being influenced by electronic music and acid-jazz.

On June 10, 2008, a recording titled &quot;Omar Rodriguez-Lopez &amp; Jeremy Michael Ward&quot; was released. It was a collaboration between the two and was recorded in 2001 before the formation of The Mars Volta. The LP consists of various ambient tracks based on field recordings in the musique concrète tradition. Rodríguez-López has continued to release a series of albums recorded in 2001 which include &quot;Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fungus&quot; and &quot;Minor Cuts and Scrapes in the Bushes Ahead&quot;, both released in late 2008.

Another album, &quot;Old Money&quot; was released in October 2008, with a vinyl version becoming available in early 2009 on the Stones Throw record label. Sonny Kay, co-owner of the former Gold Standard Labs label with Omar, created the album covers (and has done so for the majority of future Omar releases). Two Omar Rodríguez-López solo albums were released in Europe on January 26, 2009, from the Netherlands-based record label Willie Anderson Recordings: &quot;Megaritual&quot; and &quot;Despair&quot;. &quot;Despair&quot; is best described as a field recording, while &quot;Megaritual&quot; is a collaboration jam between Omar and his brother, Marcel Rodríguez-López.

In mid-2009, a new entity has been created called El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez (&quot;the New Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group&quot;) to release the first in a series of three recordings completed in 2006. Thus far these recordings have only been known as the &quot;Omar and Zach Hill collaborations&quot;. The first recording titled &quot;Cryptomnesia&quot; was released on May 5, 2009. Vocals written and performed by Bixler-Zavala were recorded in 2008. The lineup for this entity is: Omar Rodríguez-López on guitar, Cedric Bixler-Zavala on vocals, Zach Hill on drums, Jonathan Hischke on synth bass, and Juan Alderete on bass.

The Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group toured Europe in March 2009, supported by Zechs Marquise.

At the end of 2009, Rodríguez-López released three albums, &quot;Los Sueños de un Hígado&quot;, &quot;Xenophanes&quot; and &quot;Solar Gambling&quot; digitally through Rodríguez-López Productions. While &quot;Xenophanes&quot; was also released on CD and vinyl, &quot;Los Suenos De Un Higado&quot; and &quot;Solar Gambling&quot; only had a limited vinyl release. Rodríguez-López also created a video for &quot;Asco Que Conmueve los Puntos Erógenos&quot;, from &quot;Xenophanes&quot;, and posted it on YouTube on November 30, 2009.

In January 2010, &quot;Ciencia de los Inútiles&quot; was released under a new group, El Trio de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. The trio features Rodríguez-López on acoustic guitar, Ximena Sariñana on vocals and Aaron Cruz on upright bass. A video for &quot;Miércoles&quot; was also released. In May 2010, he released a collaboration titled &quot;Omar Rodriguez-Lopez &amp; John Frusciante&quot; with John Frusciante, free of charge through his website, with the option to donate. All money raised will go to the Keep Music in Schools programs. On May 30, 2010, the album &quot;Sepulcros de Miel&quot; by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quartet was digitally released, which also featured Frusciante.

The album &quot;Tychozorente&quot; was scheduled for release on November 1, 2010; however, it received an early release on September 14, 2010, as a digital download. Another album, titled &quot;Cizaña de los Amores&quot;, was digitally released on October 11, 2010. CD and vinyl versions of both albums are only available in Europe. &quot;Mantra Hiroshima&quot;, another Omar and Zach Hill collaboration, was digitally released on November 29, followed next day by &quot;Dōitashimashite&quot;, album of live material recorded in September during the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group&#x27;s first US tour. A video for &quot;Agua Dulce de Pulpo&quot; from the album &quot;Un Escorpión Perfumado&quot; was also released during that period, and the album itself was released on December 20 in digital form, with CD and vinyl versions to follow.

On April 16, 2011, Omar released &quot;Telesterion&quot;, a compilation album featuring 38 songs from Omar&#x27;s solo albums. Although this has been the only release of 2011, other projects have been hinted at, such as &quot;Двойственность вздохов&quot; (Russian for &quot;Duality of Sighs&quot;), a documentary about the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group&#x27;s Russian mini-tour, directed by Omar and shot by Paco Ibarra. The Vinyl edition of &quot;Telesterion&quot; also contained artwork for 6 solo albums that have yet to be released, and featured a new track, &quot;Cásate Colmillo&quot;, off of an album supposedly titled &quot;The Somnambulis.&quot;

On July 7, 2016, Ipecac Records announced that they would release 12 albums by Omar, fortnightly, until December 2016. They were recorded in the period 2008–2013 and one featured The Mars Volta line-up and a guest appearance by John Frusciante. The first album &quot;Sworn Virgins&quot; was released digitally on July 15, 2016, and featured the single &quot;To Kill a Chi Chi&quot;. Recorded in El Paso and Zapopan, the other titles include &quot;Corazones&quot;, &quot;Blind Worms Pious Swine&quot;, &quot;Arañas En La Sombra&quot;, &quot;Umbrella Mistress&quot;, &quot;El Bien Y Mal Nos Une&quot;, &quot;Cell Phone Bikini&quot;, &quot;Infinity Drips&quot;, &quot;Weekly Mansions&quot;, &quot;Zapopan&quot;, &quot;Nom De Guerre Cabal&quot;, and &quot;Some Need It Lonely&quot;.

===Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque (2012–2018)===
In 2012, with Mars Volta going on hiatus, Rodríguez-López formed a solo band that eventually took the name Bosnian Rainbows. It consists of Deantoni Parks (drums, keyboards), Teri Gender Bender (vocals) and Nicci Kasper (keyboards). They released one self-titled album in June 2013. On April 8, 2014, Omar announced a new musical project called Antemasque with former At the Drive-In and Mars Volta bandmates Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals) and David Elitch (drums) as well as Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The group released their first song, &quot;4AM&quot;. Flea said that Antemasque is a project between Omar and Cedric, and that he is only a contributing artist.

, both Bosnian Rainbows and Antemasque have essentially been put on hold due to touring commitments of At the Drive-In and The Mars Volta.

==Other media==
Aside from music, Rodríguez-López is also involved in filmmaking and photography. Beginning in his At the Drive-in days he started to document many kinds of things: live shows, sound checks, dressing rooms, hotels, airport lounges, sightseeing, encounters with colleagues. Since 2001 he has produced many films, of which &quot;The Sentimental Engine Slayer&quot; was the first to be released. Rodríguez-López wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, which was premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in February 2010 and saw the DVD release in January 2013. Another film directed by Omar, &quot;Los Chidos&quot;, was premiered in March 2012 at SXSW. Furthermore, Rodríguez-López and Hans Zimmer worked together to compose the score for the 2009 Guillermo Arriaga film &quot;The Burning Plain&quot;. The film was his second collaboration with the writer/director after scoring the 2007 film &quot;El Búfalo de la Noche&quot; with The Mars Volta; in addition to some original material, the score also includes material used in &quot;Amputechture&quot;. Rodríguez-López&#x27;s first photo book, &quot;Hunters in High Heels&quot; documenting the years from 2000 to 2006, was slated to release in 2013 but was since postponed indefinitely due to unknown reasons.

==Musicianship==
===Style===
Rodríguez-López&#x27;s compositional and playing style is characterized by, among other factors, riffs, melodies based in minor modes, changing meters, unresolving dissonances (in particular a heavy use of the tritone), chromatic passages, and lengthy improvisation. He is also known for his vast array of effects pedals; in a feature appearing in Guitar World, Rodríguez-López stated that he &quot;began to see effects as allies in my war against the guitar&quot;. In that interview he also stated that he hated the guitar for a very long time. He only utilized it because it was the instrument his bandmates could &quot;relate to&quot;. He said he &quot;wrestled&quot; guitar by adding effects and playing oddly to attempt &quot;making it sound like anything besides this thing I hate—the guitar!&quot;. However, he claimed to feel more comfortable with the instrument on &quot;Amputechture&quot;.

Rodríguez-López plays guitar left-handed. He has cited salsa pianist and bandleader Larry Harlow as his primary influence. Both Rodríguez-López and bandmate Cedric Bixler-Zavala have recorded with former Can lead singer Damo Suzuki for the &quot;Please Heat This Eventually&quot; EP. In the progressive rock genre in which The Mars Volta are often categorized, he has professed that he &quot;like[s] a lot of those groups, particularly King Crimson and early Genesis.&quot; As such, he has cited his main and clearest influence Frank Zappa, Crimson&#x27;s Robert Fripp, jazz fusion guitarist John McLaughlin as well as hardcore punk and hard rock guitarists Greg Ginn and Jimi Hendrix respectively. He has also named Siouxsie, Missing Persons, Wayne Shorter as being among &quot;all the greats&quot; along with Steve Reich, Tangerine Dream, Tchaikovsky, Tom Petty and Marvin Gaye.&quot; He has also stated that film is a primary influence on him, likening his recording style to that of a film director, where the &quot;scenes are shot out of sequence and the final creation is in the hands of the director.&quot;.

===Equipment===
Omar has endorsed Ibanez guitars since The Mars Volta&#x27;s inception in 2001. Previously he used Squier Super-Sonic guitars while playing with At the Drive-In. He also recorded &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; with a Gibson SG II from the early 1970s which he also used in live improv shows with Flea and John Frusciante. He uses Seymour Duncan JB Jr. pickups as well. Although he tunes to E standard tuning, Omar uses Ernie Ball .013-.056 gauge strings with a wound G string, saying that &quot;they feel more real than the really thin ones&quot;. Omar also plays through an Orange Rockerverb combo amp as well. In recent years, Omar has taken a minimalist approach to his pedals, which at one point was a very complex setup. During The Mars Volta&#x27;s 2011 tour with Soundgarden, he used a Boss DD5 Digital Delay, an MXR Phase 90, an Electro-Harmonix Memory Boy analog delay, a Boss PS-6 Harmonist, a Line 6 M9 Stompbox Modeler, an MXR M133 Micro Amp, an Ibanez WH10V2 wah-wah, an Ibanez TC7 tri-mode chorus, and a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler.

During The Mars Volta&#x27;s final shows and At the Drive-In&#x27;s reunion tour, Rodríguez-López switched back to a full-sized Ibanez Jetking guitar, although retaining his preferred single-pickup and volume knob configuration and 24&quot; neck scale. In a recent interview with TC Electronic, he is seen using a blue Ibanez Jetking with two full-size humbuckers.

While performing with Bosnian Rainbows, Rodríguez-López began to use a mid-1960s era left-handed Supro 3/4 scale guitar with a single pickup in the bridge position. Shortly afterwards, he was seen playing a custom Ibanez guitar that closely resembled his Supro. In addition, Rodríguez-López now uses flatwound strings on his guitar. Rodríguez-López&#x27;s pedalboard for Bosnian Rainbows consisted of a Boss TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, an Empress Superdelay, a Blackout Effects Whetstone analog phaser, a Catalinbread Semaphore tremolo pedal, a Boss DD-5 Digital Delay, an EarthQuaker Devices Rainbow Machine, an Empress Fuzz pedal, a Catalinbread Calisto chorus/vibrato pedal, and a Boss SL-20 slicer.

From 2015 onwards, Rodríguez-López began playing Ernie Ball Music Man guitars, notably the Albert Lee HH and St. Vincent models, as well as his signature Mariposa model from 2019 onwards.

==== Signature guitars ====
In 2008, Ibanez released the ORM-1 Omar Rodriguez-Lopez signature guitar, which was produced through 2012 and based on the Ibanez Jetking.

Rodríguez-López designed and released the Mariposa signature guitar with Ernie Ball Music Man in 2019. It has an okoume body in an angular shape with a laser-etched floral pickguard, and two custom humbuckers featuring two volume knobs with a tethered tone circuit, which creates variations in treble response when the pickups are set at different levels.

===As producer===
Rodríguez-López is also notable for his recording, producing and songwriting techniques. He has claimed that he is &quot;ignorant of music theory&quot; and that thus he lacks knowledge in writing music in standard notation, claiming that his songwriting &quot;comes from emotion completely&quot;. Rodríguez-López claims to write all of the music for his projects, then dictates the performance to the musicians involved.

In addition to his producing credits with The Mars Volta and his solo albums, he also produced the only LP from the defunct LA-based band Radio Vago and in 2009, handled the production of a recording titled &quot;Terra Incognita&quot; from actress/singer Juliette Lewis&#x27; band The New Romantiques. Omar also produced (as well as contributed bass to) &quot;Sin Sin Sin&quot;, the debut LP from the band Le Butcherettes, which was released in 2011 on Rodriguez-Lopez Productions.

== Personal life ==
Rodríguez-López says he enjoys the company of his close friends and family when not fulfilling obligations to his many bands and projects. He has been a vegetarian for most of his life.

In the documentary film &quot;Omar and Cedric: If This Ever Gets Weird&quot;, Rodríguez-López discussed instances of homophobia that he suffered as a result of his &quot;fluid&quot; sexuality, and opened up on having been in a romantic relationship with bandmate Jeremy Michael Ward which was kept in secret. 

Rodríguez-López dated singer-songwriter and actress Ximena Sariñana from 2008 to 2011. His current partner is musician and singer Teresa Suárez (aka Teri Gender Bender).

<doc id="719097" wikidata="Q1757668" url="?curid=719097" title="Coat of arms of Wrocław">
<text>The coat of arms of Wrocław is divided into quarters. It dates back to 1530. The arms were approved by Emperor Charles V.

==Description==
In the centre is the severed head of John the Baptist, the city&#x27;s patron saint. The crowned lion rampant in the first (upper left) quarter represents the Kingdom of Bohemia, which Wrocław became part of upon the death of Duke Henry VI of Silesia in 1335. In the second (upper right) quarter there is the Silesian eagle which comes from the ruling Piast dynasty. The letter &quot;W&quot; in the third quarter stands for both &quot;Wratislavia&quot;, the Latin name of the city, and for the name of the legendary founder of the city Wrócisław (probably Duke Vratislaus I of Bohemia). In the fourth quarter there is John the Evangelist with halo and an overturned crown as pectorale.

Its blazon is: &quot;Quarterly, I: Gules, a lion rampant queue fourch erect facing sinister Argent, armed and langued Or outlined Sable, crowned Or outlined Sable; II: Or, an eagle Sable charged with across its breast and wings a crescent Argent upward pointing with a crosslet Argent attached rising from the middle; III: Or, a capital letter &#x27;W&#x27; Sable serifed; IV: Gules, the head and shoulders of St. John the Evangelist gardant Argent, with youthful face and long hair Argent outlined Sable and with halo Or outlined Sable, issuant from an inverted crown Or outlined Sable. Surmounting all at center a roundel Argent, double-bordered in Sable, charged with St. John the Baptist&#x27;s head Argent, with beard and hair Sable, semi-gardant turned toward the dexter.&quot;

==Evolution==

The first version of the coat of arms was created in 1292, and featured only the head of John the Baptist. After Wrocław became part of the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1335, the Bohemian lion was added to the shield in alternating quadrants. The only surviving example of this version of the shield now exists on the wall of Lauf Castle near Nuremberg.

Wrocław became a German-speaking city by 1242 and was known as Breslau. It became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 and the German Empire in 1871. In 1938, the coat of arms was abolished, as the Nazi authorities viewed it as too Slavic. It was replaced by a &quot;purely German&quot; coat-of-arms, a shield parted horizontally, with a black Silesian eagle on the top without Christian crosslet on the breast, and an Iron Cross in red field on the bottom. This was abolished after Breslau became part of Poland in 1945 as Wrocław.
Wrocław, as part of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, changed the coat of arms again as the authorities now considered the original version as too Germanic. It was replaced by a &quot;purely Polish&quot; coat of arms with a Silesian black eagle on gold and a Polish white eagle on a red field. These coat of arms were used from 1948 to 1990.

After the collapse of communism, the city decided to revert to the coat of arms of 1530, albeit in a more stylized form.

<doc id="719104" wikidata="Q996487" url="?curid=719104" title="Listowel">
<text>Listowel ( ; , ) is a heritage market town in County Kerry, Ireland. It is on the River Feale, from the county town, Tralee. The town of Listowel had a population of 4,794 according to the 2022 census, the third largest in the county. Listowel is also the name of a townland within the town and an encompassing civil parish.

Described by the organisers of Listowel&#x27;s writers festival as the &quot;Literary Capital of Ireland&quot;, a number of internationally known playwrights and authors have lived there, including Bryan MacMahon and John B. Keane.

== Location ==

Listowel is on the N69 Limerick – Foynes – Tralee road. Bus Éireann provides daily services to Tralee, Cork, and Limerick. The nearest railway station is Tralee. Listowel used to have its own railway station on a broad gauge line between Tralee and Limerick city; however, this was closed to passengers in 1963, to freight in 1978, and finally abandoned and lifted in 1988. The station building has been preserved as a private residence.

Listowel is located at the head of the North Kerry limestone plain. Positioned in the very heart of North Kerry, on the River Feale, its hinterland is an area of mainly dairy agricultural use. The barony of Iraghticonnor is to the north, with the barony of Clanmaurice to the south. Surrounding villages include Asdee, Ballybunion, Ballyduff, Ballylongford, Causeway, Duagh, Lisselton, Lixnaw, Moyvane, Finuge and Tarbert.

== History ==
In July 2000, Listowel was officially designated as one of Ireland&#x27;s 26 &quot;Heritage Towns&quot; – in part because of modern environmental and renewal works, but also because of its architectural heritage and &quot;historic importance&quot;.

=== Origin of the name ===

Listowel&#x27;s history dates back to at least 1303 when it first appears in the Plea Roll where its name took the form of Lystothyl. By 1320 the town is referred to in ecclesiastical tax records, mis-written as Lismokill. In subsequent documents the name of the town is written variously as: Lissmoli, Listuoli, Lystuanyl, Lestovell, Lestowell, Lishtoghill, Listwohill and Listowhil. In the Annals of the Four Masters, in an entry dated 1582, the town first appears as Lios Tuathail, the currently accepted spelling of the Irish Gaelic form of the town&#x27;s name. Thomas Dineley wrote the English form of the name as &#x27;Listoel&#x27; in 1681. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century there were two versions of the name in use, Listowel and Listowell. From the late 19th Century onwards the current spelling of Listowel was generally adopted. Since the foundation of the Irish State in 1922, the town&#x27;s name has been referred to as Listowel in statute law, for example in the Statutory Instrument under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, when the Municipal District of Listowel was established as one of the six municipal districts in County Kerry.

=== Listowel Castle ===

The town developed around a fortress of the Fitzmaurice family, Listowel Castle, and its square. The last bastion against Queen Elizabeth I in the Desmond campaign, Listowel Castle was built in the 15th century and was the last fortress of the Geraldines to be subdued. It fell after 28 days siege to Sir Charles Wilmot on 5 November 1600, who had the castle&#x27;s garrison executed in the following days. The castle became the property of the Hare family, the holders of the title of Earl of Listowel, after reverting away from the Fitzmaurices, Knights of Kerry. It is now a national monument, and was subject to restoration by the Office of Public Works (OPW) from 2005. OPW tour guides are now based at the castle during the summer tourist season giving free tours of the castle.

Another smaller castle at Ballinruddery, Listowel, was built in the post-1600 period by the then Knight of Kerry.

=== Lartigue Monorailway ===
Listowel played a role in Irish railway history as it was the site of the world&#x27;s first monorail operation. The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway was built to the Lartigue system, with a double-engined steam locomotive straddling an elevated rail. It officially opened on 29 February 1888, with public services beginning on 5 March 1888. It connected the town with Ballybunion. Coaches, with a compartment on either side of the rail, had to be kept balanced. If a cow was being brought to market, two calves would be sent also, to balance it on the other side. The calves would then be returned, one on either side of the rail. In 2003, a 1000 m long replica of the original monorailway was opened.

=== Listowel Mutiny ===
Listowel was the site of a noted mutiny which occurred during the Irish War of Independence. On 17 June 1920, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Listowel police station refused to obey the commanding officer&#x27;s orders that they be relocated to police outposts outside of the town. The Black and Tans had occupied the town barracks, forcing the redeployment, something which was both dangerous and hopeless in the face of huge local hostility to the men in question. Police commissioner Colonel Smythe wished that the RIC constables would operate with the army in countering the IRA&#x27;s fight for freedom in the more rural areas. He suggested while negotiating with the constables that they would be given the power to shoot any suspect on sight. Led by Constable Jeremiah Mee, they refused, both from a point of personal safety and possibly also from a sense of sympathy with their country men struggling against the British forces. The officers were discharged after the mutiny. The episode has come down to be known as the Listowel mutiny.

=== Earl of Listowel ===
The title of Earl of Listowel is associated with the Hare family. The current incumbent Lord Listowel is Francis Michael Hare, one of the 92 hereditary peers elected to the British House of Lords.

Holders of the title have included William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel, who was a Labour politician and served as the last Secretary of State for India and Burma. Another member of the family was the Conservative politician John Hare, 1st Viscount Blakenham. He was the third son of the fourth Earl.

== Economy ==

=== Kerry Co-op ===
In the 1970s, many small dairies in Ireland started to merge so as to be able to compete with the larger milk companies within the European Economic Community (which Ireland joined in 1973). Dairies in County Kerry followed suit and Kerry Co-operative Creameries Ltd (Kerry Co-op) began trading in January 1974. In the period from 1974 to 1979, Kerry expanded its milk business in a similar fashion to other dairy co-ops. Its milk supply increased from 67 million gallons in 1974 to 87 million gallons in 1978. The new co-op acquired the independent Killarney, Limerick, Mariewasere and Ballinahina Dairies (Cork) which later became part of Kerry&#x27;s Dawn Dairies structure with the addition of Galway and Moate Dairies. However, in 1979 everything changed for Kerry Co-op when the county was chosen as a pilot area for a bovine disease eradication scheme. Allied to this, milk production was further depressed due to wet summer weather in 1979 and in 1980, which meant that Kerry lost almost 20% of its milk supply. This was significant in that it happened at a time when the co-op was in the course of completing a €18 million capital expenditure programme at the NKMP plant in Listowel.

=== Kerry Group ===

Kerry Group today is a leader in global food ingredients and flavours markets, and a leading branded consumer foods processing and marketing organisation in some EU markets.

Headquartered in Tralee, the Group employs approximately 290 people at its manufacturing plant in Listowel.

== Education ==
Listowel is serviced by many primary, post-primary and post-leaving certificate education facilities. Children between five and twelve are facilitated by Presentation Primary School for girls, Scoil Realta na Maidne, for boys, and Gaelscoil Lios Tuathail, which is a mixed school. The town has two Catholic secondary schools, Presentation Secondary School, Listowel and St. Michael&#x27;s College. The town is also served by Listowel Community College, a mixed post-primary and post-leaving certificate school and Coláiste na Ríochta, a mixed post-primary school. The town hosts Learning Initiative of North Kerry.

== Festivals and events ==

=== Listowel Races ===
The origin of Listowel races can be traced back to an annual gathering at Ballyeigh, Ballybunion, about nine miles from Listowel. This event, which dates to the early nineteenth century, consisted of a variety of games, horse-racing and a pre-arranged faction fight which concluded the event. Due to disturbances surrounding these fights, the meeting at Ballyeigh was suspended and racing transferred to Listowel, where the first meeting took place in 1858. The racecourse is located beside the River Feale, and two of the three entrances to the course are accessed by bridge across the river. The racecourse is called &quot;the island&quot; by the locals due to this fact. Traditionally it was a meeting where farmers came to spend/gamble the money they made from the harvest but it has since grown into something larger and more wideranging.

The Listowel track consists of a 1-mile, 2 furlong mile oval left-handed track with National Hunt fences and hurdles. The hurdle course is adjustable after each day&#x27;s racing to give new ground. Listowel&#x27;s racecourse is within walking distance of the town centre.

=== Listowel Writers&#x27; Week ===
Founded in 1970, Listowel is home to Ireland&#x27;s oldest literary festival. North Kerry is the birthplace of many of Ireland&#x27;s most prominent writers, including John B Keane, Bryan Mac Mahon, Brendan Kennelly, Seamus Wilmot, Gabriel Fitzmaurice, George Fitzmaurice, Maurice Walsh and Robert Leslie Boland. The Writers&#x27; Week Festival was established to celebrate those writers and to provide an opportunity for other Irish writers to develop their talents and meet new audiences.

The concept of the Literary Workshop was first introduced at Writers&#x27; Week in 1971 by Bryan MacMahon. At the event, writers share their skills in poetry, fiction, theatre, and screen – with workshops in song writing, comic writing and storytelling also subsequently added. Writers&#x27; Week also provides a programme of literary events including lectures, readings, workshops, book launches, seminars, theatre, literary and historical tours, art exhibitions, music and dance.

Competitions are also held, together with a series of literary awards. The total prize fund of €35,000 includes the Kerry Group Novel of the Year and The Pigott Poetry Prize.

Participants have included: Nobel Laureate and Booker Prize-winner J. M. Coetzee, Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, Booker Prize winners Kazuo Ishiguro, John Banville, James Kelman and Anne Enright, Poets Laureate Ted Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy, and Andrew Motion, playwrights Tom Murphy, Brian Friel, Roddy Doyle, Frank McGuinness and Hugh Leonard, poets Michael Hartnett, Leland Bardwell, John Montague, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Roger McGough, Rita Ann Higgins and Kate Cruise O&#x27;Brien, and other novelists and writers including Blake Morrison, Chris Whyte, Lionel Shriver, Colm Tóibín, Jennifer Johnston, John McGahern, Joseph O&#x27;Neill, Sebastian Barry, Joseph O&#x27;Connor, Hugo Hamilton, Edna O&#x27;Brien, Douglas Kennedy, Patrick McGrath, William Trevor, Colum McCann, Gerard Donovan, Frank McCourt, Irvine Welsh, Robyn Rowland, Andrew Lindsay, Michael Cunningham, Jane Urquhart, Anatoly Kudryavitsky, Cees Nooteboom, Michael Dibdin, Abdel Bari Atwan, Clive James, Melvyn Bragg, Alain De Botton, Lloyd Jones, Robert Fisk, Jung Chang, Terry Jones, Gabriel Byrne, and Graham Norton.

John B. Keane of Listowel wrote:

Beautiful Listowel, serenaded night and day by the gentle waters of the River Feale.
Listowel where it is easier to write than not to write,
Where first love never dies, and the tall streets hide the loveliness,
The heartbreak and the moods, great and small,
Of all the gentle souls of a great and good community.
Sweet, incomparable hometown that shaped and made me.
=== Listowel Food Fair ===
The Listowel food Fair has been running annually since 1995. The festival promotes local artisan food products, and attracts celebrity chefs, nutritionists and artisan food entrepreneurs.

== Political representation ==

At Irish local government level, the town of Listowel is located in the Municipal District of Listowel, which is named after the town. This is one of the six municipal districts in County Kerry, each of which also acts as a local electoral area (LEA) for the purpose of returning members to the local authority. The Listowel LEA currently elects six of the 33 members of Kerry County Council. In the 2019 Kerry County Council election, six councillors were elected from the Listowel LEA, three representing the Fine Gael party, two representing Sinn Féin, one representing Fianna Fáil and one independent councillor. Under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, as well as being members of Kerry County Council, the six Listowel LEA councillors are also members of Listowel Municipal District Council. As a division of a local authority, a Municipal District can exercise certain powers of the local authority.

At national level, Listowel is part of the five seat of the Kerry Dáil constituency, which returns five TDs to Dáil Éireann. For European Parliament elections, Listowel is located in the Ireland South constituency, which elects five of Ireland&#x27;s fourteen MEPs.

== Sport ==
Listowel Emmets is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club which supports the traditional Irish sport of Gaelic football,plus music, dance and the Irish language. The club has a tradition of GAA involvement and achievement since June 1885 when Listowel GAA (The Feale Amateurs) was established as a GAA branch. In 1956 Emmets GAA Club was formed and in the following year the senior, intermediate and minor North Kerry League titles were won. In 1979, the Listowel Emmets GAA pitch next to St. Michaels College was closed for redevelopment; it re-opened again in 1981, and was renamed in honour of Frank J Sheehy who was appointed as chairman to the County Board in 1953.

Listowel Celtic is the local soccer club, playing in the Premier A division of the Kerry District League. Listowel also has clubs involved in tennis, athletics, rugby, basketball, badminton and cricket. Listowel also hosts a 24hr running race; the Listowel Endurance Festival.

== Architecture ==
Listowel&#x27;s architectural features include the four-arch bridge traversing the River Feale at the entrance to the town. Dating from 1829, according to local tradition this bridge (referred to locally as the &quot;Big Bridge&quot;) replaced a smaller wooden structure, which had been destroyed in floods.

Local plasterer and builder Pat McAuliffe (1846–1921) used stucco or external plaster to decorate the façades of townhouses and shops in the town and surrounding area. A native of Listowel, McAuliffe created a number of plasterwork works, including &quot;The Maid of Erin&quot;, which depicts a romantic image of Mother Ireland surrounded by a harp, a wolfhound and other symbols of Ireland. The Maid was at the centre of a controversy in 1999 when a new owner decided to &quot;cover her dignity&quot; and painted a dress on her famous bosom. A debate ensued and he was persuaded to return her to her original semi-nude state.

The hard, coral-like fruiting bodies reach tall. The colour ranges from cream to semi-tan. The branches rise in ringlike arrangements resembling a crown. Basidia and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. The spore print is white.

The sesquiterpene compounds pyxidatols A-C, tsuicoline E and omphadiol have been obtained from the liquid culture of this fungus.

=== Similar species ===
DNA evidence and microscopy indicates that the species is closely related to members of the genera &quot;Russula&quot; and &quot;Lentinellus&quot;, as well as &quot;Auriscalpium vulgare&quot;. &quot;Artomyces piperatus&quot; is found on the North American West Coast. Other similar species include &quot;Clavulina avellanea&quot;, &quot;C. cristata&quot;, &quot;C. divaricata&quot;, &quot;C. piperata&quot;, and &quot;C. taxophila&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Ramaria stricta&quot; is similar but lacks crown-like tips.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In eastern North America, &quot;A. pyxidatus&quot; appears on decaying wood from June to September. It can be observed throughout Northern Canada during the growing season. In Britain, it was recorded in 2011, almost 116 years after its previous reliable report, a collection made by mycologist Carleton Reale on 20 October 1886. Two subsequent records have been provided in Britain since 2011; one by Yvonne Davidson in Kent in 2018, and one by Cameron Ambler in East Sussex in 2021. Found in Kent in 2023 It is widespread but uncommon in Western Europe. They are also widely found in the pine forest of northeastern India, known as the &quot;eight sisters of India&quot;.

== Uses ==
Although usually found in insubstantial quantities, these fungi are considered edible raw, but are better cooked. According to one guide, it is best served when fried with chopped potatoes.

The fungus are known to be served as meal amongst the tribal groups of Northeast India since time immemorial.

<doc id="719112" wikidata="Q2120989" url="?curid=719112" title="Tadeusz Rejtan">
<text>Tadeusz Reytan (surname also alternatively spelled as &quot;Rejtan&quot;, and rarely &quot;Reyten&quot;; ; ; 20 August 1742 – 8 August 1780) was a nobleman from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was a member of the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the Nowogródek Voivodeship. Reytan is remembered for a dramatic gesture he made in September 1773, as a deputy of the Partition Sejm. There, Reytan tried to prevent the legalization of the first partition of Poland, a scene that has been immortalized in the painting &quot;Rejtan&quot; by Jan Matejko. He has been the subject of many other art works, and is a symbol of patriotism in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus. Despite his efforts, the partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was legalized soon afterwards.

==Biography==

Tadeusz Rejtan was born on 20 August 1742 in Hruszówka (now Lyakhavichy District, Brest Region of Belarus). The date is as given in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, some other sources give other dates. He was the son of a minor, but relatively wealthy noble, Dominik Rejtan, podkomorzy of Novogrudok and Teresa Wołodkowicz. He was likely the oldest of five brothers. His brother, Michał, would come to hold the position of pisarz (scribe) of Nowogródek. His grandfather, also named Michał, was the skarbnik (treasurer) of Mazyr. The family had been aligned to the powerful Radziwiłł family, and Tadeusz would also pledge his allegiance to them.

Afterwards, he served in the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army in a cavalry banner. He might have participated in the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), but historians are not certain about the validity of that claim.

In 1773, in the Bar Confederation&#x27;s aftermath, a special session of the Polish–Lithuanian Sejm was convened in Warsaw, capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, by its three neighbours (Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria) in order to legalize their First Partition of Poland. That Sejm became known as the Partition Sejm. Rejtan was one of the deputies that tried to prevent the first partition&#x27;s legalization, despite threats from the foreign ambassadors. For example, Russian ambassador Otto von Stackelberg declared that in the face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed by the Russians; other threats included executions, confiscation of estates, and increase of partitioned territory.

Rejtan was a deputy to that Sejm, from the constituency of Novogrudok, and the local sejmik gave him very explicit instructions to defend the Commonwealth. On the Sejm&#x27;s first day (19 April), and possibly even in the discussions on the previous days, Rejtan, working together with the Stanisław Bohuszewicz and Samuel Korsak, strongly protested against the proposal of Adam Poniński who wanted to form a confederated sejm (such as sejm would be immune to the threat of liberum veto). Rejtan&#x27;s arguments were primarily legal; he argued that Poniński had no right to be the Marshal of the Sejm, and that there are no grounds to form a confederated sejm. He also appropriated one of the two Marshal&#x27;s staffs. During a discussion with another deputy, Rejtan stated that he was aware that the foreign powers could force the issue, but his intention was to make it clear that any treaty they force through the Sejm would not be unanimously accepted. Rejtan was thus able to disrupt the proceedings on that day. He would attempt to delay and disrupt the proceedings, but he was ignored, overruled and threatened by other deputies, as on 20 April Poniński returned to the Sejm with an escort of Russian and Prussian soldiers. A quickly convened Sejm court begun deliberating on the potential illegality of Rejtan&#x27;s actions, but little discussion occurred on that day.

The next day, the court sentenced him to imprisonment and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops made it difficult for the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.

Nonetheless, Rejtan would face some difficulties, many orchestrated by Poniński, and had asked general Robert Scipio von Lentulus, commander of the Prussian garrison stationed in Warsaw, for an escort, which he received. Rejtan would remain in Warsaw during the next few years (the Partition Sejm lasted till 1776), but his influence diminished. He issued a print manifesto in December 1773, criticizing the current confederated sejm, and supportive of the Bar Confederation, but it received little publicity.

After the partition, Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He spent the rest of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on 8 August 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress of the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He is said to have been escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family mansion which he would never leave up until his death. Eventually, he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.

==Legacy==

Rejtan&#x27;s dramatic attempt to prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort to protect him from some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the information about his patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–1792, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period.
He was, and to the present day is, considered a shining example of a patriot. He has been the subject of many art works, poems, songs and books. Writers who mentioned him included Stanisław Staszic, Franciszek D. Kniaźnin, Adam Mickiewicz, Józef Szujski, Leon Wegner, Seweryn Goszczyński, Jan Lechoń, Artur Oppman, Seweryna Duchińska, Maria Konopnicka, Kazimierz Brończyk, Wiktor Woroszylski, Marian Brandys, and Jerzy Zawieyski. A bust of Rejtan was funded by his family in 1860, and is in the National Museum in Kraków. A small monument of him is said to have collapsed in Kraków in 1946, soon after World War II, and was not rebuilt until 2007. A medal with his face was issued in the Grand Duchy of Poznań in 1860. Several portraits of him exist, including one by Franciszek Smuglewicz. However, his most famous depiction is that by Jan Matejko, who showed a more fictionalized version of the events at the Partition Sejm in his 1866 painting, &quot;Rejtan na sejmie warszawskim 21 kwietnia 1773 – upadek Polski&quot; (&quot;Rejtan at the Warsaw Sejm of 21 April 1773 – the Fall Of Poland&quot;). Numerous schools, streets and military units in Poland bear his name as well.

==Notes==
a Polish historian Jerzy Michalski in his 1988 entry on Rejtan in Polski Słownik Biograficzny notes that historian Wanda Konczyńska found some documents contradicting the extent of Rejtan&#x27;s mental illness, and suggesting he might have taken part in some business transactions, but the evidence is not conclusive.

<text>Antonia de Sancha (born 14 September 1961 in Hammersmith, London) is an English actress and businesswoman best known as the former mistress of British Conservative Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister David Mellor which became public knowledge in 1992.

She is the daughter of a Spanish film producer father, who died in the mid-1980s, and a Swedish mother who, suffering from severe clinical depression, died by suicide 18 months later, shortly before her daughter began studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At the time of revelation of her affair, de Sancha was described by some news outlets as a &quot;soft-porn actress&quot; because she had played the part of a prostitute in a film in which she had simulated sex. The affair with Mellor was a contributory factor in his subsequent resignation from the cabinet on 24 September 1992.

Believing her acting career was ruined and aware that newspapers were making money out of the story while she was not, de Sancha hired publicist Max Clifford to sell her story to various newspapers. She made about £30,000 from those sales.

The furore that followed publication left her deeply unhappy. &quot;It was emotional rape&quot;, de Sancha told an interviewer 10 years after the scandal referring to the bugging of her flat which led to the affair being made public. She had scarcely any work as an actress since the scandal, and considered the scandal as the reason a subsequent marriage failed.

She was the subject of an instalment of the Discovery Channel documentary series &quot;The Mistress&quot; in 2002. De Sancha subsequently ran an Indian textiles importing business in Portobello Road, Kensington, West London.

<doc id="719116" wikidata="Q187116" url="?curid=719116" title="Time Zone (video game)">
<text>Time Zone is a multi-disk graphical adventure game written and directed by Roberta Williams for the Apple II. Developed in 1981 and released in 1982 by On-Line Systems (later Sierra Entertainment), the game was shipped with six double-sided floppy disks and contained 1,500 areas (screens) to explore along with 39 scenarios to solve. Produced at a time when most games rarely took up more than one side of a floppy, &quot;Time Zone&quot; is one of the first games of this magnitude released for home computer systems. Ports were released for Japanese home computers PC-88, PC-98 and FM-7 in 1985.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Time Zone&quot; allows players to travel through time and across the globe solving puzzles while meeting famous historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Cleopatra, and Julius Caesar. The game has static pictures and a text parser that understands two-word commands.

==Development==
The game used the company&#x27;s existing &quot;Hi-Res Adventures&quot; engine. Roberta Williams was the designer and writer, and its development took six months and about ten other people—the first example of the modern video game-development model in which programmers, artists, and designers are separate people in a team larger than a few people—worked on the game for a year. Each of the more than 1,300 locations had its own artwork. The company hoped to release &quot;Time Zone&quot; before Christmas 1981, but did not do so until March 1982. Because of the game&#x27;s difficulty, Sierra offered a telephone help line that players could call for hints.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot; must be getting ready for a computer game category, if &quot;Time Zone&quot; is any indication of things to come. Without a doubt, it is the longest adventure game to date&quot;. The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;Best Computer Adventure&quot; at the 4th annual Arkie Awards.

Williams&#x27; brother-in-law and fellow employee, John, later said, &quot;It frankly wasn&#x27;t that good&quot;. &quot;Time Zone&quot; sold poorly; the original retail price of US$99 () may make it the most expensive computer game in history after inflation. The game was reissued the year of its release as part of the short-lived SierraVentures line.

<text>De Glind is a village near Barneveld in the middle of Netherlands, in the province Gelderland.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 1321 as Ghelinde, and means &quot;fenced off terrain&quot;. The &quot;havezate&quot; Glinthorst was mentioned for the first time in 1325. It was demolished around 1780. In 1840, it was home to 498 people. In 1916, a church was built in De Glind.

In 1911, Foundation De Glindhorst was established by and a village for disadvantaged youth was built. Farmers could rent a piece of land, but were obliged to take care of children. The youth village still exists, and is nowadays operated by the Rudolph Foundation.

<doc id="719119" wikidata="Q73116" url="?curid=719119" title="Armour-piercing discarding sabot">
<text>Armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) is a type of spin-stabilized kinetic energy projectile for anti-armor warfare. Each projectile consists of a sub-caliber round fitted with a sabot. The combination of a lighter sub-caliber projectile with a full-caliber propellant charge allows for an increase in muzzle velocity compared to full-caliber rounds, giving the round increased armor-penetration performance. To further enhance their armor-penetration capabilities, APDS rounds typically feature a hardened core made from tungsten or another hard, dense material.

For a given caliber, APDS ammunition can effectively double the armor penetration of a gun when compared to full-caliber rounds such as AP, Armor-piercing Capped (APC), and Armor piercing Capped Ballistic Cap (APCBC) projectiles.

APDS-rounds were commonly used in large caliber tank guns up until the early 1980s, but have since been superseded by armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) projectiles, which use fin-stabilization and can be fired from smoothbore guns. APDS rounds remain in use for small or medium calibers, such as in saboted light armour penetrator (SLAP) ammunition.

== History and development ==
Armour piercing discarding sabot munitions were developed to increase penetrating performance of anti-tank projectiles by generating higher impact velocity. A larger projectile would require a completely new weapon system, but increasing velocity faced the limitation that steel armour-piercing (AP) projectiles shattered at velocities above about 850 m/s when uncapped. Tungsten carbide, with twice the density of steel, was seen as a solution, due to its greater hardness and ability to withstand shock and pressure, but its greater weight reduced velocity.

In the 1930s, to increase terminal velocity without increasing diameter, engineers working for the French Edgar Brandt company developed &quot;saboted&quot; ammunition, in which a heavier sub-calibre core was surrounded by a lightweight &quot;sabot&quot; (the French word for a clog or the hard outer layer of hooves; however Brandt himself used term &quot;propulsive basal member&quot; in his English patents), that was retained for the duration of the flight until impact. They fielded two calibres; the 75 mm/57 mm for the 75mm Mle 1897/33 anti-tank gun and 37 mm/25 mm for several 37 mm gun types just before the French-German armistice of 1940, before evacuating to the United Kingdom, to join ongoing anti-tank ammunition development efforts there. The British term for this construction was &quot;Armour-Piercing, Composite Rigid&quot; (APCR)

While the sabot improved short range effectiveness, the additional drag caused the performance of the shot to fall off dramatically with increasing range. Between 1941 and 1944, Permutter and Coppock, two designers with the UK Armaments Research Department (ARD), developed a sabot that was discarded immediately after leaving the barrel, so the smaller, heavier, sub-projectile could carry on at the much higher velocity, suffering less drag due to its smaller diameter.

In mid-1944, the resulting APDS (the &#x27;D&#x27; standing for &quot;discarding&quot;) projectile type was introduced into service for the UK&#x27;s 57mm QF 6-pounder anti-tank gun and later in September 1944 for the 76mm QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun. 

== Construction ==
=== Sabot construction ===
The sabot of a large calibre APDS consists of a light high strength alloy full diameter pot and base unit, which is screwed together. The front part of the pot has three-four petals (sabots) which are covered with a centring band (often a nylon derivative). The rear half has a rubber obturator and driving band (again nylon) held in place by the screw-in base unit. The base unit, if a tracer element is attached to the sub-projectile, has a hole located at the centre. Before firing, the sub-projectile and sabot are locked together.

Due to the high setback forces (g-forces), friction between the pot and sub-projectile allows spin to be transferred, thus stabilising the sub-projectile. Small/medium calibre APDS use a lightweight high strength alloy base pot and three or more plastic petals. To transfer the spin to the core in small/medium calibre weapons, the core tends to have a notch at its base. Under bore acceleration, which can be higher than 100,000 g, the uneven base is forced into the softer pot material, locking the sub-projectile to the pot and imparting spin.

Not all small/medium calibre APDS rely on this technique, another method for spin coupling is by using the forward plastic petals. The petals are of a slightly larger diameter than the lands in the rifled bore. This forces the petals tightly against the core, increasing the friction between them and allowing the spin to be transferred.

=== Projectile construction ===
The sub-calibre projectile consists of a high density core with a penetrating cap, enclosed within a high strength sheath (steel) with a lightweight alloy (aluminium-magnesium alloy) ballistic cap. For modern small/medium calibre APDS projectiles, the core is not sheathed and the ballistic and penetrating caps are combined. A tracer element may be added to the APDS sub-projectile, for large calibre weapons this is part of the outer sheath, for small/medium calibre weapons it is contained within a hollow cavity in, or attached to, the base of the core.

Most modern APDS projectiles use high strength shock resistant tungsten alloys. The main constituent is tungsten, alloyed or sintered with/to cobalt, copper, iron or nickel. Very few APDS use depleted uranium (DU) titanium alloy for the penetrator material, though the retired 20 mm MK149-2 Phalanx CIWS round did use DU.

== Function ==
=== Discarding of sabot ===
When a large calibre APDS is fired and while still within the bore, the setback forces shear the forward petals, partly unlocking the sub-projectile from the sabot, but still holding it rigidly within the pot. Gas pressure is used to delay the unlocking of the pins holding the rear part of the sub-projectile by gyroscopic forces. Once outside the barrel, the pins, centring band and forward petals are released or discarded by projectile spin, the aerodynamic drag removes the pot/base unit. 

As an APDS sub-projectile does not require driving bands and the core is supported at the base and ogive region, a far more aerodynamic projectile shape can be chosen. This, in combination with the sub-projectile&#x27;s higher sectional density, gives the resulting sub-projectile vastly reduced aerodynamic drag in comparison to full-calibre tungsten-core projectiles, such as armour-piercing, composite rigid (APCR). Both the higher initial velocity and the reduced drag result in higher velocity at impact. This also lowers flight time and improves accuracy. Accuracy can suffer if there are unwanted sabot/sub-projectile interactions during discard.

=== Impact example ===
The sequence upon impact of the APDS projectile, for example the 120 mm L11, as used on the Chieftain tank, fired L15 APDS (muzzle velocity 1370 m/s), goes as follows: the lightweight ballistic cap is crushed, the penetrating cap then strikes the armour, distributing the shock across the whole surface of the core&#x27;s nose, reducing the initial shock experienced by the core. The steel sheath surrounding the core peels away, and the core goes on to penetrate the armour. The penetration of the L15 APDS is approximately 355 mm of rolled homogeneous armour at 1000 m.

== FAPDS ==
During penetration, a frangible projectile&#x27;s core, a high density alloy, fragments into many high-velocity pieces. The resulting projectiles are called Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot (FAPDS) for APDS types, or FRAP (Frangible Armour Piercing) for full-calibre projectiles. As of 2010, Diehl Defence called its FAPDS a &quot;Penetrator with Enhanced Lateral Effect&quot; (PELE). It was developed with Rheinmetall.

The effect of a frangible projectile on a lightly armoured target is much the same as a high explosive incendiary round, but with a cloud of dense, high-velocity fragments penetrating deeper into the target&#x27;s interior. Upon striking heavy armour the effect of FAPDS is more akin to a standard APDS, albeit with higher fragmentation of the core, and hence lethality if the armour is perforated.

<text>Life and Energy is a 1962 book by Isaac Asimov. It is about the biological and physical world, and their contrasts and comparisons. Thus the book is divided into two sections, which is separated by further sub-sections (i.e. chapters): 1) energy; 2) body. In order to accomplish its goal, the book starts with &quot;layman&quot; discussions about energy and how these can be used to single out human from other living systems, or even living systems from non-living matter, what differentiates a rock from an oyster, and finishes with advanced concepts, how living systems are able to &quot;produce&quot; energy.

==First Chapters: Energy==
The first chapters covers the common questions of the distinctions between living and inanimate objects.

==Following Chapters==
Asimov then explains in a step by step manner about the physical world first through slow, but interesting chapters. He writes about the effect and major role of the evolution and advance of man by fire and heat, he tells about thermodynamics (and its laws), he recollects the thoughts of previous scientists, and their painstaking works, and finally, the quantum theory and radiation, which has revolutionised physics and technology. An explanation of electricity and basic chemistry laws and features are also included.
The physical section ends here, and continues into biology. He now continues on with special chemistry, and leaves behind physics. From this, the book leads into the functions of enzymes, amino acids, cells, the body as a whole, and the process of the cells and organs to work together to become one.

<doc id="719121" wikidata="Q17896" url="?curid=719121" title="Avalon Airport">
<text>Avalon Airport is a domestic airport, located in Avalon in the City of Greater Geelong in Victoria, Australia. While located outside the Melbourne metropolitan area, it is the second busiest of the four airports serving the state capital in passenger traffic. It is located north-east of the Geelong CBD and south-west of the Melbourne CBD. The airport is operated by Avalon Airport Australia Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Linfox.

Avalon is currently served by passenger airline Jetstar, which began domestic flights in 2004. The airport is also the site of the biennial Australian International Airshow, which has been held at the venue since 1992.

Unlike Melbourne Airport, Avalon Airport is not governed by the Commonwealth&#x27;s &quot;Airports Act 1996&quot;. The airport has a single runway in addition to a helipad.

==History==
The airport is located on land of the original indigenous owners, the Wathaurong people, and a scatter stone area is preserved on the Avalon Airport site, out of respect for the original owners. The land has undergone many changes over the past century.

In the beginning, the airport was a sheep and cattle farm and homestead, founded by James Austin, an immigrant from Glastonbury, Somerset, England. James established his farm and named the homestead &quot;Avalon&quot; after the isle of Avalon at Glastonbury, the mythical island in the Arthurian legend. In 1952 the Commonwealth Government bought at Avalon for just 110 pounds, as the land was deemed to be of poor quality farmland due to the abundance of volcanic rock littering the surface.

The airport was opened in 1953, to cater for the production of military aircraft. Previously, the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne had used a runway beside the factory. However, newer jet aircraft required a longer runway for safe operations, and the Fisherman&#x27;s Bend runway was being encroached upon by development.

A runway was built by Country Roads Board, with the first plane landing on 3 April 1953 – a four-engined Avro Lincoln heavy bomber flown from Fishermans Bend. The English Electric Canberra light bomber was under construction at same time at the new airport. In 1959, Qantas established a training base at the site.

In 1961, Government Aircraft Factories combined with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, and built and serviced 110 Mirage fighters at the site, and in 1970 Jindivik Target Aircraft transferred to Avalon Airport from Fishermens Bend, adding production of 170 Nomad and 75 Hornet military jets, in addition to servicing of other jets.

In 1985, the Government Aircraft Factories changed its name to Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA). Aircraft produced during this time included the GAF Jindivik remotely piloted aircraft, and Nomad civil aircraft. Under the ASTA banner, engines for the Dassault Mirage III jet fighters were produced, as well as assembly of the F/A-18 multirole combat aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

In October 1988, the ASTA Aircraft Services division took the first Boeing 747 to Avalon for servicing and maintenance. By December 1993, fifty 747 aircraft had been through the Avalon facility, and 820 people were employed at the site. October 1995 saw a Cathay Pacific Lockheed L-1011 flown to Avalon for scrapping by ASTA Aircraft Services, in what was a one-off event.

Training of pilots from Japan&#x27;s All Nippon Airways commenced at the airport on 8 September 1993.

On 27 June 1995 Aerospace Technologies of Australia was privatised by the Commonwealth Government, selling the aircraft divisions to Rockwell Australia Limited, and the airport operations to Avalon Airport Geelong Pty Ltd. The ASTA airliner overhauling facility was closed in 1997.

The first scheduled passenger flights out of the airport were operated by Hazelton Airlines, who commenced flights between Avalon Airport and Sydney in February 1995. 36-seat Saab 340 aircraft were used for the service. The service was discontinued after a short time due to a lack of passengers.

===Post-privatisation===
In 1997, the federal Government of Australia, through the Department of Defence, granted Linfox a 50-year plus a 49-year option lease of the airport. Between 1997 and 2001 Linfox developed proposals to develop the land which formed the basis of the Avalon Airport Master Plan draft, 2013. In 1992, the airport began hosting the Australian International Airshow.

On 1 June 2004, Jetstar started commercial flights from the airport, in addition to their operations at Melbourne Airport.

In April 2010, Tigerair Australia announced it would base two aircraft and commence operations from Avalon later that year. By June 2011 however, Tigerair Australia announced it would be withdrawing several flights from Avalon, to be operated instead from Melbourne Airport. The remaining Tigerair Australia services were withdrawn after a series of incidents that led to airline&#x27;s operations being suspended by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the following month.

In October 2012, the Federal Government announced that the airport&#x27;s lease would be amended, allowing for the construction of a new terminal and the implementation of international flights. Avalon is the second airport in Victoria to be designated as a port of entry for freight operations.

In February 2022, Bonza announced that the airport would become one of its 17 destinations with the airline planning to fly to the Sunshine Coast from Avalon. Bonza started commercial flights from the airport on 21 February 2023, in addition to their operations at Melbourne Airport. Bonza suspended all flights in early 2024.

=== International flights ===
It was announced on 4 February 2018 that AirAsia X would move their Melbourne Airport operations to Avalon Airport by the end of the year. AirAsia X Airbus A330s would service the twice daily direct flights to Kuala Lumpur. Announcing it on 10 July 2018 the airline commenced its operations from Avalon Airport on 5 December 2018.
A media release on 22 October 2019 from the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Office stated that VietJet Air was expected to begin flights from Avalon to Vietnam in the second half of 2020. However, when VietJet commenced their flights to Melbourne in April 2023, they operated out of Melbourne Airport instead.

On 11 December 2019, it was announced on Citilink&#x27;s Instagram social media account that flights to Denpasar (Bali), Indonesia would be added to Avalon Airport&#x27;s list of international flights. On 10 January 2020, it was stated that the daily flight would commence on 24 January 2020.

On 18 July 2022, Air Asia announced they would be restarting flights to Australia and New Zealand but will be ending their Avalon operations and begin operating out of Melbourne Airport for the first time since 2018.

===Future===
====Airport Master Plan 2015====
The Avalon Airport Master Plan was prepared by Avalon Airport Pty Ltd in September 2015 and was endorsed by the Department of Defence. The document provides for a significant expansion of the airport&#x27;s operations, as well as the establishment of non-aviation related developments.

==Facilities==

Since the introduction of Jetstar in 2004, the Avalon Airport terminal facilities have expanded from the original size of to nearly . Over $100 million has been invested in the airport thus far to complete the following:

* An apron expansion to accommodate a further four aircraft as well as enable the opportunity to accommodate an aircraft the size of a Boeing 747.
* A total of seven A320 sized aircraft can now be parked simultaneously in front of the airport terminal.
* Installation of a flight information display system
* Fuel farm expansion to triple storage capacity from 500,000 to 1,500,000 litres of A1 jet fuel plus installation of new fuel pipelines
* Construction of a new bus, taxi and hire car road and various rerouted roads to manage incoming passenger traffic and other road infrastructure upgrades
* Fuel farm electrical maintenance and demolition of unused buildings
* Significant infrastructure upgrades as part of the Australian International Airshow

=== Passenger terminal ===
The current terminal facility is approximately in area and houses four gates capable of servicing aircraft up to and including the size of the Airbus A321. In its present configuration, the terminal can accommodate around six domestic departures per hour. The airport has a total of eight aircraft parking bays; there are six on the Northern Apron and two on the Eastern Apron. On the Northern Apron, the airport can accommodate five Code C Aircraft (Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 aircraft) and one Boeing 747.

Avalon Airport can accommodate two Boeing 747s or two Boeing 787s on the Eastern Apron. The Eastern Apron is also a remote parking bay which doubles as a freight bay. The airport is capable of fitting one Airbus A380 at a time on the Eastern Apron; this means it can also accommodate the freighter version of the Boeing 747-8, which is slightly smaller.

Currently the airport terminal is not equipped with aerobridges, and does not feature any guest lounges.

===Freight facilities===
The most notable freight operations include the Australian Grand Prix, Supercars and Superbikes, plus some specialist charters including livestock race horses, fresh produce, military hardware, touring rock bands. The airport can facilitate loads on all aircraft types from the Airbus 380 series down, with equipment available to load via the main deck, lower deck, nose or tail end of the Aircraft, with a maximum lift of 16 tonnes. It has three dedicated freighter parking positions: Two on its Eastern and one on the Northern Freighter Aprons.

===Aircraft heavy maintenance===

Avalon Airport has six hangars in total: of hangar space, including three Boeing 747 hangars. Three of these are customised B747 hangars that were used by Qantas. The Qantas Engineering maintenance facility commenced operations on 13 May 1998.

It was also responsible for the Qantas Group&#x27;s aircraft commercial project work, including cabin reconfigurations and refurbishment.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate scheduled flights at Avalon Airport:

Since 2020, international passenger flights no longer operate out of Avalon Airport.

==Other uses==
The video clip of Human Nature&#x27;s 2000 song &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; was filmed at the airport.

In July 2013, it was proposed by Geelong City Council that a theme park be built at Avalon, and they have held discussions with Village Roadshow and other companies concerning the proposal. African Safari World was a previous proposal at nearby Werribee Zoo that did not get approved.

The biennial Australian International Airshow operates from Avalon Airport. The project is owned by Aviation Development Australia Limited. The event attracts a total attendance of over 195,000 across the six days, including exhibitors from the international aerospace industry and government, military, scientific and trade delegates.

==Ground transport==
===Road===
Avalon Airport is linked to Geelong and Melbourne by the adjacent Princes Freeway. The airport has 1,500 airport car spaces, a taxi rank and a ride-share pick-up/drop-off bay.

===Public transport===
====Bus====
In 2017, Skybus launched services from the Melbourne CBD and Geelong to Avalon Airport. 

From June 2014 to December 2018, the &quot;Sunbus&quot; service was provided by Sita Buslines. It connected Avalon with Melbourne, Werribee and Geelong.

====Future rail connection====
In May 2011, the Victorian Minister for Public Transport committed $3 million for the planning of a rail link to Avalon Airport. In January 2013, three route options were presented. The railway line would start by running along the existing Port Fairy railway line, and then divert towards Avalon Airport, south of Little River, at one of three locations. The eastern option would see the line break away closer to Melbourne, near Cherry Swamp Road and Little River. The central option would place the diversion 2.5 kilometres southwest, near Peak School Road at Lara. The western route option would divert from the existing line closer to Geelong, at Plains Road, Lara. Each of the three routes would run over the Princes Freeway, north east of the Beach Road interchange at Little River, running under the flight path to a new station inside the terminal. The government would need to acquire private farmland to complete the link and is considering a number different options, including a light rail service, automated driverless trains used at several international airports.

In August 2013, the state government indicated that it may alter its election promise to build the $250 million train line to Avalon Airport, and instead create a cheaper light rail link from Melbourne&#x27;s south-west. Department documents show the government is now considering other options to meet interim demand, such as light rail, buses, or &quot;driverless transport options which are used at many airports around the world&quot;.

In September 2023, Avalon Airport called for an alternate plan which would see an infill airport station built along the existing Geelong line, with a new road for shuttle buses to connect it directly with the airport. The plan was costed at $140 million with Avalon Airport CEO Tony Brun proposing to split the cost three ways between the airport, the state and federal governments.

In May 2024, due to delays with the construction of the Melbourne Airport rail link, State Treasurer Tim Pallas suggested that Avalon Airport could receive funding for a new rail link instead if Melbourne Airport is unable to agree on its station design.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 6 August 1976, a prototype N24 Nomad crashed shortly after takeoff at Avalon while a flight test of modifications to the tail of the aircraft. Two of the three crew members were killed in the accident, notably including pilot Stuart Pearce, father of actor Guy Pearce.
*On 30 June 2011, a Tiger Airways Australia Airbus A320 flight from Sydney performed a missed approach at Avalon outside of published procedures, resulting in the aircraft overflying the Geelong suburb of Leopold at a dangerously low altitude, without guidance from Air Traffic Control. The incident made national headlines and triggered a five-week grounding of the airline over a busy school holiday period while a safety audit was conducted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

<doc id="719127" wikidata="Q7017378" url="?curid=719127" title="Paterson (poem)">
<text>Paterson is an epic poem by American poet William Carlos Williams published, in five volumes, from 1946 to 1958. The origin of the poem was an eighty-five line long poem written in 1926, after Williams had read and been influenced by James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. As he continued writing lyric poetry, Williams spent increasing amounts of time on &quot;Paterson,&quot; honing his approach to it both in terms of style and structure. While &quot;The Cantos&quot; of Ezra Pound and &quot;The Bridge&quot; by Hart Crane could be considered partial models, Williams was intent on a documentary method that differed from both these works, one that would mirror &quot;the resemblance between the mind of modern man and the city.&quot;

While Williams might or might not have said so himself, commentators such as Christoper Beach and Margaret Lloyd have called &quot;Paterson&quot; his response to T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot;. The long gestation time of &quot;Paterson&quot; before its first book was published was due in large part to Williams&#x27;s honing of prosody outside of conventional meter and his development of an overall structure that would stand on a par with Eliot and Pound yet remain endemically American, free from past influences and older forms.

The poem is composed of five books and a fragment of a sixth book. The five books of &quot;Paterson&quot; were published separately in 1946, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958, and the entire work collected under one cover in 1963. A revised edition was released in 1992. This corrected a number of printing and other textual errors in the original, especially discrepancies between prose citations in their original sources and how they appeared in Williams&#x27;s poem. &quot;Paterson&quot; is set in Paterson, New Jersey, whose long history allowed Williams to give depth to the America he wanted to write about, and the Paterson Falls, which powered the town&#x27;s industry, became a central image and source of energy for the poem.

==Background==

===Initial efforts===
In 1926, influenced by his reading of the novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce, William Carlos Williams wrote an 85-line poem entitled &quot;Paterson&quot;; this poem subsequently won the Dial Award. His intent in this poem was to do for Paterson, New Jersey what Joyce had done for Dublin, Ireland, in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Williams wrote, &quot;All that I am doing (dated) will go into it.&quot; In July 1933, he reattempted the theme in an 11-page prose poem, &quot;Life Along the Passaic River.&quot; By 1937, Williams felt he had enough material to start a large-scale poem on Paterson but realized that the project would take considerable time to complete. Moreover, his then-busy medical practice precluded his attempting such a project at that time. This did not stop Williams from taking some preliminary steps in the meanwhile. He wrote the poem &quot;Paterson, Episode 17&quot; in 1937 and would recycle it into the major work 10 years later. &quot;Morning,&quot; written in 1938, was another poem intended for &quot;Paterson&quot;. In 1939, Williams sent James Laughlin at New Directions Publishing an 87-page sheaf of poems labeled &quot;Detail and Parody for the Poem Paterson.&quot; This collection as such was not published. However, 15 of its &quot;details,&quot; titled &quot;For the Poem Patterson [spelling Williams]&quot; appeared in the collection &quot;The Broken Span,&quot; which New Directions released in 1941.

===Addressing &quot;The Waste Land&quot;===
One reason Williams deliberated on &quot;Paterson&quot; was his longstanding concern about the poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T.S. Eliot, which with its overall tone of disillusionment had tapped into a much larger sense of cultural ennui that had arisen in the aftermath of World War I and become a touchstone for the Lost Generation. As Margaret Lloyd states in her critical reappraisal of &quot;Paterson&quot;, &quot;many critics and poets indicate their poetical inclinations by aligning themselves specifically with T.S. Eliot or William Carlos Williams, and ... &quot;Paterson&quot; was, from its very conception, intended to be a &#x27;detailed reply&#x27; (SL, 239) to the Eliot bias of modern poetry.&quot;

To Williams, Eliot &quot;had moved into a vacuum with his poem,&quot; in Mariani&#x27;s words, and taken American poetry with it. Moreover, Eliot&#x27;s use of conventional meter (though varied in places by speech rhythms) did not seem endemic to American speech and thus seemed outside the course that American poetry had seemed headed since the poetry of Walt Whitman. For American poetry (and by extension his own work) to progress, Williams argued, it needed to move away from foreign traditions and classic forms and essentially find its own way.

Hart Crane, with whom Williams was in contact, had felt similarly about &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. However, Williams dismissed Crane&#x27;s reaction to &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, his long poem &quot;The Bridge&quot;, as &quot;a direct step backward to the bad poetry of any age but especially to that triumphant regression [French symbolism] which followed Whitman and imitates...the Frenchman [Mallarmé] and came to a head in T.S. Eliot excellently.&quot; Williams also studied &quot;The Cantos&quot; by Ezra Pound, the first 30 parts of which appeared in 1931. While Williams noted that Pound, in Mariani&#x27;s words, &quot;had managed to lift the language to new heights,&quot; he had also &quot;deformed the natural order of speech at times...while somehow saving the excellences and even the forms of old.&quot;

===Developing form and method===
Williams, according to Mariani, concluded that tackling &quot;Paterson&quot; meant &quot;to find a way beyond Eliot&#x27;s poetic, and beyond Pound&#x27;s, as well...in sculpting the words themselves, words with hard, concrete, denotative jagged edges.&quot; At the same time, the New Jersey dialect the poet wanted to set into verse could sound, as biographer Paul Mariani phrases it, &quot;unrelievedly flat.&quot; In a note that accompanied the &quot;Detail and Parody&quot; manuscript he sent to New Directions, Williams told Laughlin and his associate Jim Higgins, &quot;They are not, in some ways, like anything I have written before but rather plainer, simpler, more crudely cut...I too have to escape from my own modes.&quot; The formal solution eluded Williams into the early 1940s. In December 1943, he wrote Laughlin, &quot;I write and destroy, write and destroy. [&quot;Paterson&quot; is] all shaped up on outline and intent, the body of the thinking is finished but the technique, the manner and the method are unresolvable to date.&quot; Finding a form of American vernacular that would facilitate poetic expression, which approximated speech rhythms but avoided the regularity of their patterns as both Joyce and Walt Whitman had done, proved a long trial-and-error process. This period proved doubly frustrating as Williams became impatient with his progress; he wanted to &quot;really go to work on the ground and dig up a Paterson that would be a true Inferno.&quot;

Williams also studied Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot; for clues on how to structure the large work he had in mind. Muriel Rukeyser&#x27;s &quot;US1&quot; also caught Williams&#x27; attention for its use, with a technical skill that seemed to rival Pound&#x27;s in &quot;The Cantos&quot;, of such diverse and seemingly prosaic materials as notes from a congressional investigation, an X-ray report and a physician&#x27;s testimony on cross-examination. He wrote to fellow poet Louis Zukofsky, &quot;I&#x27;ve begun to think about poetic form again. So much has to be thought out and written out there before we can have any solid criticism and consequently well-grounded work here.&quot;

In 1944, Williams read a poem by Byron Vazakas in &quot;Partisan Review&quot; that would help lead him to solutions in form and tone for &quot;Paterson&quot;. Vazakas had written to Williams before the poem had appeared. Williams now wrote Vazakas, praising him for the piece and urging him to collect some of his work into a book. He also asked to see more of Vazakas&#x27;s work as soon as possible. According to Mariani, the way Vazakas combined &quot;a long prose line&quot; and &quot;a sharply defined, jagged-edged stanza&quot; to stand independent of each other yet remain mutually complementary suggested a formal solution. Williams also found an &quot;extension, a loosening up&quot; in tone in Vazakas&#x27;s poems—an approach Williams would find seconded in the poem &quot;America&quot; by Russell Davenport in &quot;Life Magazine&quot; that November. Between these works and Williams&#x27;s own continued efforts, he hit upon what Mariani calls the &quot;new conversational tone—authoritative, urbane, assured&quot; that Williams sought for his large-scale work. By late June 1944, Williams was working in earnest on the notes he had accumulated for &quot;Paterson&quot;, &quot;gradually arranging and rearranging the stray bits with the more solid sections&quot; as he approached a &quot;first final draft&quot; of what would become &quot;Paterson I&quot;.

In his preface to the revised edition of &quot;Paterson&quot;, editor Christopher MacGowan points out that, even with Williams&#x27; protracted challenges in finalizing the poem&#x27;s form, he &quot;seems to have always felt close to the point of solving his formal problems.&quot; He promised it to Laughlin for the Spring 1943 book list of New Directions. He told Laughlin April 1944 that &quot;Paterson&quot; was &quot;near finished&quot; and nine months later that it was &quot;nearing completion.&quot; Even after he had received the galley proofs of Book I in September 1945, Williams was dissatisfied and revised the work extensively. This delayed its appearance in print to June 1946.

==Composition==

Williams saw the poet as a type of reporter who relays the news of the world to the people. He prepared for the writing of &quot;Paterson&quot; in this way:

The Poetry Foundation&#x27;s biography on Williams notes the following source: With roots in his [short] 1926 poem [also entitled] &quot;Paterson,&quot; Williams took the city as &quot;my &#x27;case&#x27; to work up. It called for a poetry such as I did not know, it was my duty to discover or make such a context on the &#x27;thought&#x27;.&quot;

While writing the poem, Williams struggled to find ways to incorporate the real world facts obtained during his research in preparation for its writing. On a worksheet for the poem, he wrote, &quot;Make it factual (as the Life is factual-almost casual-always sensual-usually visual: related to thought)&quot;. Williams considered, but ultimately rejected, putting footnotes into the work describing some facts. Still, the style of the poem allowed for many opportunities to incorporate &#x27;factual information&#x27;, including portions of his own correspondence with the American poet Marcia Nardi and fellow New Jersey poet Allen Ginsberg as well as historical letters and articles concerning figures from Paterson&#x27;s past (like Sam Patch and Mrs. Cumming) that figure thematically into the poem.

==Response==

The Poetry Foundation biography on Williams notes the following critical response to Williams&#x27; Modernist epic: [Williams biographer James] Breslin reported &quot;reception of the poem never exactly realized his hopes for it.&quot; &quot;Paterson&quot;&#x27;s mosaic structure, its subject matter, and its alternating passages of poetry and prose helped fuel criticism about its difficulty and its looseness of organization. In the process of calling &quot;Paterson&quot; an &quot;&#x27;Ars Poetica&#x27; for contemporary America,&quot; Dudley Fitts complained, &quot;it is a pity that those who might benefit most from it will inevitably be put off by its obscurities and difficulties.&quot; Breslin, meanwhile, accounted for the poem&#x27;s obliqueness by saying, &quot;&quot;Paterson&quot; has a thickness of texture, a multi-dimensional quality that makes reading it a difficult but intense experience.&quot;

Poet/critic Randall Jarrell praised Book I of the poem with the following assessment:&quot;Paterson (Book I)&quot; seems to me the best thing William Carlos Williams has ever written. . .the organization of &quot;Paterson&quot; is musical to an almost unprecedented degree. . . how wonderful and unlikely that this extraordinary mixture of the most delicate lyricism of perception and feeling with the hardest and homeliest actuality should ever have come into being! There has never been a poem more American.

However, Jarrell was greatly disappointed with Books II, III, and IV of the poem, writing the following: &quot;Paterson&quot; has been getting rather steadily worse [with each subsequent Book]... All three later books are worse organized, more eccentric and idiosyncratic, more self-indulgent, than the first. And yet that is not the point, the real point: the poetry, the lyric rightness, the queer wit, the improbable and dazzling perfection of so much of Book I have disappeared—or at least, reappear only fitfully.

==Awards==

The U.S. National Book Award was reestablished in 1950 with awards by the book industry to authors of 1949 books in three categories. William Carlos Williams won the first National Book Award for Poetry.

==References in popular culture==
Williams himself &quot;looms large&quot; in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2016 film, &quot;Paterson&quot; starring Adam Driver. According to a 2017 review, the &quot;linguistic infrastructure&quot; of the film was informed by concepts found in the five-volume poem.

<text>Lionel Abrahams (11 April 1928 – 31 May 2004) was a South African novelist, poet, editor, critic, essayist and publisher. He was born in Johannesburg, where he lived his entire life. He was born with cerebral palsy and had to use a wheelchair until 11 years of age.

Best known for his poetry, he was mentored by Herman Charles Bosman, and later edited seven volumes of Bosman&#x27;s posthumously published works. Abrahams went on to become one of the most influential figures in South African literature in his own right, publishing numerous poems, essays, and two novels. Through Renoster Books, which he started in 1956, he published works by Oswald Mtshali and Mongane Wally Serote heralding the emergence of black poetry during the apartheid era.

An account of his important role in introducing black writers to PEN is given by his close friend, the writer Jillian Becker

In 1986, he married Jane Fox. That year, he was awarded honorary doctorates of literature by the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Natal.

<doc id="719139" wikidata="Q431116" url="?curid=719139" title="Cyrille Regis">
<text>Cyrille Regis (9 February 1958 – 14 January 2018) was a professional footballer who played as a forward. His professional playing career spanned 19 years, where he made 614 league appearances and scored 158 league goals, most prolifically at West Bromwich Albion and Coventry City. Born in French Guiana, Regis also won five caps with the England national team.

==Early life==
Regis was born on 9 February 1958 in Maripasoula, French Guiana, the son of Robert Regis, a labourer from Saint Lucia and Mathilde Regis, a seamstress. His father moved to England in 1962, with the rest of the family, including Cyrille, following a year later. Cyrille grew up in Harlesden, located in the Borough of Brent, and attended Cardinal Hinsley High School. At primary school, Regis said that he was a much better cricketer than footballer. &quot;I was an outdoor child. So I just wanted to play cricket outside, and I played much more cricket back then because football was just another sport I did without any real passion.&quot;

After leaving school, Regis trained as an electrician, earning a City and Guilds diploma; he continued to practise the trade until his move into professional football.

==Club career==
===Non-league career===
The 1975–76 season saw Regis move to Athenian League club Molesey, for whom he scored around 25 goals during his one campaign for the club. He was then approached by Boreham Wood, but did not join them. Instead, he went on to join semi-professional Hayes of the Isthmian League, signing on 7 July 1976.

Regis was spotted by West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s chief scout Ronnie Allen, who recommended that the First Division club should sign him. With the Albion directors unsure of paying a four-figure fee for such a young, unproven player, Allen offered to fund any initial payment from his own pocket, so sure was he that Regis would make it in the top tier of English football. The transfer took place in May 1977, for an up-front fee of £5,000, plus another £5,000 after 20 appearances.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Shortly after bringing Regis to Albion, Allen took over as team manager, following the resignation of his predecessor Johnny Giles. Regis made his first team debut in a League Cup match against Rotherham United on 31 August 1977, scoring twice in a 4–0 win. Three days later, Regis made his league debut in a 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough. Again he found the net, taking the ball from the halfway line to the penalty area before scoring with a right-foot drive. Middlesbrough&#x27;s David Mills, who later became a teammate of Regis at Albion, described it as &quot;a goal of sheer brilliance&quot;.

Regis also scored in his first FA Cup match in January 1978, helping Albion to beat Blackpool 4–1. A few days later, Albion appointed a new manager, Ron Atkinson. Ronnie Allen had departed in late December to manage the Saudi Arabia national team and John Wile, the club&#x27;s captain, had acted as caretaker manager in the interim.

Whilst a West Bromwich Albion player, he played in a benefit match for Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players.

===Coventry City===
In 1984, Regis joined Coventry City for a fee of £250,000. With Coventry, Regis won the only major trophy in his career, the 1987 FA Cup. Johan Cruyff wanted to sign Regis for Ajax as a replacement for AC Milan-bound Marco van Basten, but he accused his own club&#x27;s directors of delaying the deal until Regis&#x27; FA Cup exploits took him out of the Dutch club&#x27;s price range. Regis later became the first Coventry player to score a winning goal at Anfield, in their first ever league victory there, a 1–0 win over Liverpool in November 1989. This came a season after he had also scored in City&#x27;s first ever top flight victory, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa at Highfield Road.

Regis won the Coventry City London Supporters&#x27; Club Player of the Year for the 1986–87 season, and regularly comes in high in any legend polls for the club.

=== Aston Villa ===
Before the 1991–92 season, Regis joined Aston Villa on a free transfer, reuniting him with his former manager at West Brom, Ron Atkinson. He was one of six Villa players who made their debut for the club on the opening day of the season, scoring in a 3–2 win away to Sheffield Wednesday. Regis made over 40 appearances in his first season for Villa, and finished as the club&#x27;s leading league goalscorer, joint with Dwight Yorke.

=== Later career ===
Following the end of 1992–93, Regis moved to West Midlands rivals, Wolverhampton Wanderers. His stay with Wolves only lasted for one season, during which time he made 22 appearances, scoring twice.

Regis joined Wycombe Wanderers in August 1994. Forming a striking partnership with Simon Garner, he scored ten goals in his only season at the Buckinghamshire club.

Regis ended his professional career by playing in the Third Division with Chester City. He scored seven times in 29 league appearances, helping Chester finish 8th, before retiring due to injury in October 1996.

==International career==
Regis&#x27; dual French and British nationality made him eligible to play for either the English or French national sides, but it was England that he chose to represent. He made his England under-21 debut on 19 September 1978, in a 2–1 victory over the Denmark under-21s in Hvidovre. His first England B game was a 1–0 win against Czechoslovakia B in Prague on 28 November 1978. He played in two further matches for the B team in 1980. He scored his first goal for the England under-21s on 5 June 1979, in a 3–1 away win against Bulgaria. The result helped England reach the latter stages of the 1980 European Championship, although it was the only one out of six qualifying matches in which Regis participated. He played in the away legs of both the quarter-final and semi-final, where England lost to East Germany. In all he played six times for the under-21s, scoring three goals.

Despite winning five caps for the full England side, Regis never played the full 90 minutes for his country at senior level; he played as a substitute three times and was himself substituted twice. He made his international debut on 23 February 1982 in a 4–0 win over Northern Ireland in the Home International Championship at Wembley. Regis came on as a substitute for Trevor Francis in the 65th minute. His final international appearance for England was in 1987 against Turkey at Wembley, which ended in an 8–0 win for the home side, where he came on for the last 20 minutes.

He was the third black player to be capped by England at the highest level after Viv Anderson and Laurie Cunningham.

==Legacy==
In 2004, Regis was voted as West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s all time Cult Hero in a BBC Sport poll, gaining 65% of the vote. In the same year, he was named as one of Albion&#x27;s 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations. In the 2007–08 season, a Coventry City Hall of Fame picture gallery was erected at the Ricoh Arena, containing thirty Coventry greats from the club&#x27;s entire history, whom he was among.

Two months after Regis&#x27; death, the under-21 match between England and Romania at Molineux on 24 March 2018 was designated the Cyrille Regis International in tribute. England won the match, 2–1. On 28 July 2018, two of Regis&#x27; former clubs (West Bromwich Albion and Coventry City) played in a friendly match dubbed the &quot;Regis Shield&quot;; West Bromwich won 5–2.

==Personal life==
His younger brother is former player Dave Regis, and his nephew is Jason Roberts, for whom he acted as an agent. He was also the cousin of sprinter John Regis.

Regis became an evangelical Christian after a car crash claimed the life of his friend and former teammate Laurie Cunningham in 1989. He and Cunningham had been involved in a similar crash two years earlier. After retiring from playing, Regis worked in a variety of coaching roles before becoming an accredited football agent with the Stellar Group Ltd.

He was awarded an honorary fellowship by the University of Wolverhampton in 2001. Regis and his wife Julia visited water-related projects in Ethiopia in 2007, as part of their continued support for WaterAid.

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.

== Death ==
Regis died of a heart attack on 14 January 2018. He was 59 years old.

<text>Helmut Walcha (27 October 1907 – 11 August 1991) was a German organist, harpsichordist, music teacher and composer who specialized in the works of the Dutch and German Baroque masters.

Blind since his teenage years, he is known for his recordings of the complete organ works of Johann Sebastian Bach, entirely played by memory.

== Biography ==

Walcha was born on 27 October, 1907 in Leipzig, Germany. After being vaccinated for smallpox at a young age, his eyesight slowly worsened until he became fully blind at age 19. Despite his disability, he entered the Leipzig Conservatory and became an assistant at the Thomaskirche to Günther Ramin, who was professor of organ at the conservatory and Thomaskantor (a position held by Bach himself). Some two decades later, Ramin would teach another renowned Bach interpreter and organist, Karl Richter. In 1929, Walcha accepted a position in Frankfurt am Main at the Friedenskirche and remained in Frankfurt for the rest of his life. From 1933 to 1938 he taught at the Hoch Conservatory. In 1938 he was appointed professor of organ at the Musikhochschule in Frankfurt and organist of the Dreikönigskirche in 1946. He retired from public performance in 1981 and died in Frankfurt on 11 August, 1991.

Walcha recorded Bach&#x27;s complete solo keyboard works twice, once in mono (1947–52), and again in stereo from 1956 to 1971. The former (mono) cycle has been digitally re-mastered and re-issued as a 10-CD boxed set. This latter stereo cycle (released 10/09/2001), has been remastered, and repackaged in a 12-CD box. This edition also contains the recording of his own conclusion of the last fugue of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; - previously unreleased.

Walcha&#x27;s completion of the last fugue of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; was also recorded by his former pupil George Ritchie as part of Ritchie&#x27;s recording the work, released in 2010.

Walcha also composed for the organ. He published four volumes of original chorale preludes (published by C. F. Peters and recorded in part by, for example, Renate Meierjürgen) as well as arrangements for organ of orchestral works written by others.

He lectured on organ music and composition (illustrated by his own playing) at the Hoch Conservatory and the Frankfurt Musikhochschule. One other contribution to music scholarship is his attempted completion of the final (unfinished) fugue of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;.

Walcha taught many significant American organists of the twentieth century who travelled to Germany (some of them as Fulbright scholars): these include Robert Anderson, David Boe, Margaret Leupold Dickinson, Melvin Dickinson, Delbert Disselhorst, Betty Louise Lumby, Paul Jordan, David Mulbury, Fenner Douglass, Jane Douglass, Ray P. Ferguson, Grigg and Helen Fountain, Barbara Harbach, Charles Krigbaum, J. Reilly Lewis, George Ritchie, Margaret Vardell Sandresky, and Russell Saunders - all of whom became major teachers and performers after their studies abroad.

A section of the documentary film &quot;Desert Fugue&quot; is about Walcha, and explains how he memorised music part by part, and passed on this method of learning counterpoint to his pupils.

== Selected works ==

=== Recordings ===

==== Works by others ====
Walcha&#x27;s &quot;opus magnum&quot; is the recording of the entire organ works by Johann Sebastian Bach, which he recorded both in mono (1947–52) and stereo (1956–71) for Archiv Produktion (a subsidiary of Deutsche Grammophon). The original mono cycle was Archiv&#x27;s first release and included an improvisation by Walcha at the Organ of St. Peter and Paul in Cappel, built by Arp Schnitger in 1680; Walcha also used the Stellwagen Organ in St Jacob Church in Lübeck (built in 1636–37 by Friederich Stellwagen by extending the previous ca. 1480 organ, one of Stellwagen&#x27;s most appreciated works). The stereo cycle was the first stereo recording made by Deutsche Grammophon and was reissued including Walcha&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, comprehensive of Walcha&#x27;s own completion of the last fugue.

* Bach: Organ Works. Performed by Helmut Walcha. 12-CD set. Archiv Produktion (Deutsche Grammophon), Catalog No. 463712 (&quot;Walcha&#x27;s Bach holds a similar place in the annals of recording to Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s Schubert, Toscanini&#x27;s Verdi, and Gieseking&#x27;s Debussy.&quot; -- )
* Bach: Great Organ Works. Performed by Helmut Walcha. 2-CD set. Deutsche Grammophon, Double Catalog No. 453064 (one disc with Walcha playing the organ of St. Laurenskerk in Alkmaar and the other with him playing the organ of Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune in Strasbourg).

Works of Georg Böhm, Nicolaus Bruhns, Dietrich Buxtehude, Vincent Lübeck, Johann Pachelbel, Samuel Scheidt, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, and Franz Tunder.

Helmut Walcha has also recorded most of Bach&#x27;s harpsichord works (the English and French Suites, the Goldberg Variations, Partitas, the Italian Concerto, 15 Inventions and 15 Sinfonias, the Well-Tempered Clavier) for EMI. These recordings are still available from EMI-Toshiba (Japan) as well as from Warner. The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Goldberg Variations are also available in Europe in a 5-CD set. He also recorded The Well-Tempered Clavier for Deutsche Grammophon, using a Ruckers cembalo for the first book and a Hemsch for the second book. This recording is only available in the Far East (Korea, Japan).

Walcha&#x27;s selection from the organ works of Dietrich Buxtehude was later reissued in a single CD release:

* Dietrich Buxtehude: Orgelwerke • Organ Works. CD. Archiv Produktion, 1989, Catalog No. 427 133–2. Includes BuxWV 157, 159, 140 to 142, 145, 146, 149, 159 to 161 (the latter being Buxtehude&#x27;s most famous work Passacaglia in D minor).

All Walcha&#x27;s recordings, including other recordings of Bach works for Archiv, Deutsche Grammophon and Philips Records (harpsichord works, etc.), were reissued in 2021 by Deutsche Grammophon to mark the 30th anniversary of Walcha&#x27;s death.

<doc id="719144" wikidata="Q838369" url="?curid=719144" title="Solaris Bus &amp; Coach">
<text>Solaris Bus &amp; Coach sp z o.o. is a Polish manufacturer of public transport vehicles (buses, trolleybuses and trams), with its headquarters in Bolechowo-Osiedle near Poznań. It is a subsidiary of Spanish rolling stock manufacturer CAF with a market share for electric buses in Europe of about 18%.

The firm arose from the enterprise [[Neoplan]] Polska [[Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością|Sp. z o.o.]], established in 1994. A production facility was launched in Bolechowo-Osiedle near Poznań in 1996. The first low-floor bus produced in Bolechowo rolled off the assembly line on 22 March 1996 and it is this very date that is understood as the beginning of the company&#x27;s history. 1999 saw the premiere of the first city bus of the Solaris brand – the Solaris Urbino 12. In 2001 the company was rebranded into Solaris Bus &amp; Coach Sp. z o.o., only to be converted from a limited liability company into a joint-stock company. The company is not listed on the stock exchange.

Solaris city buses are available in diverse drive configurations as well as bodywork sizes and types. In 2006, Solaris became the first manufacturer to market, in Europe, the first serially produced hybrid drive bus Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid. The portfolio of the bus maker covers conventionally fuelled vehicles (diesel) as well as those with an alternative drive (electric, hybrid and CNG buses or trolleybuses). The Solaris Urbino 12 electric was the first Polish, and the first electric bus at that, to win an international title for the year Bus and Coach of the Year 2017. In that year, Solaris had reached a turnover of Euro 444 million. In July 2018, it was announced that Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) had acquired Solaris.

==History==

=== Neoplan Polska ===
In 1994, engineer Krzysztof Olszewski founded the company Neoplan Polska Sp. z o.o., a branch office for the Polish market of German bus brand Neoplan. In 1995, this enterprise won a tender for the delivery of 72 low-floor city buses for Poznań. The tender was made conditional upon locating the bus manufacturing factory in the vicinity of Poznań. As a result, the company launched an assembly plant for buses in Bolechowo-Osiedle. The first bus produced by Neoplan Polska came fresh off the production line on 22 March 1996. Having carried out the order for Poznań, the firm went on to reach the position of Polish market leader in the segment of low-floor city buses. Initially, the Bolechowo plant manufactured licence-based buses of the Neoplan family:

* Neoplan N4009
* Neoplan N4016
* Neoplan N4020
* Neoplan N4021

The buses stood out from other ones thanks to their reliability and the quality of execution, but above all thanks to their innovative design and, which was a novelty back then, its accessibility for elderly and disabled people thanks to the low floor. An element distinguishing the Neoplan buses produced in Poland from those made abroad was the green dachshund logo pasted onto the left-hand corner of the front face. It was supposed to symbolise the low-floor feature of the bus and the simplicity of use. The colour of the dachshund was a reference to the company&#x27;s environmental commitment in the production of public transport vehicles. The green dachshund has remained the symbol of the company to this day.

In the second half of the 1990s, the company Neoplan Polska expanded its own technical office in charge of research and development. Back then, the company was already using software that allowed it to shorten the time needed to design and build a prototype of a new model. Towards the end of the 1990s Neoplan launched a new generation of city buses. However, Mr Olszewski decided not to launch their production in the Bolechowo plant, as they would not meet with interest in Poland on account of their exorbitant price. Then, in 1998, the Neoplan Polska engineers constructed the first city bus to be produced only in Bolechowo – the Neoplan K4016TD (and its shorter version, the Neoplan K4010TD), for marketing purposes dubbed &quot;Olibus&quot;. 1999 saw the début of the first city bus of the Solaris Urbino family (see: section City and intercity buses). To begin with Neoplan Polska was tied by its contract with Neoplan, so the company of Mr Olszewski was able to sell buses only in Poland or in countries in central and eastern Europe. In 2001, Neoplan was taken over by German company MAN. That is why on 1 September 2001, the firm Neoplan Polska was turned into a private limited company (pol. &quot;spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością)&quot;, and its name was changed to Solaris Bus &amp; Coach Sp. z o.o. Krzysztof and Solange Olszewski became the sole owners. From that point on the export of Solaris buses was no longer limited by contracts with Neoplan, and all ties to that company were rendered invalid. On 1 July 2005 the company was transformed into joint-stock company (pol.&quot;spółka akcyjna&quot;) Solaris Bus &amp; Coach S.A.

Years later his wife Solange Olszewska noted: “My husband and I were looking for a name that would evoke positive connotations in all languages, that would be easy to pronounce and would be related to the future. We were unable to find anything suitable. Then, among hundreds of words, we noticed “solaris” – a simple name, bringing to mind positive associations with sunshine and beginning with the same letter as my first name.

=== Acquisition by CAF ===
On 5 September 2018 Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) finalised its acquisition of Solaris Bus &amp; Coach. This was following an announcement on 3 July 2018. Additionally, CAF has entered into an agreement with the Polish Development Fund for the acquisition by the latter of a minority stake in Solaris (35%) in the same terms and conditions agreed in by CAF in the acquisition of Solaris. On 4 October 2018, Javier Calleja was named CEO. On 1 January 2023, Javier Iriarte took over as CEO of Solaris.

=== Planned North American market entry ===
In August and September 2023, Solaris tested its Trollino trolleybus in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in the first operation of a Solaris bus in North America. The company has announced its intentions to enter the U.S. and Canadian markets in the following years, offering only trolley, battery-electric, and hydrogen fuel cell buses.
In April 2024, Solaris secured its first order for transit buses in North America, with an order for five Urbino NAe40 12-meter (40-foot) battery-electric buses from MTA Regional Bus Operations in New York City.

== Models ==

=== City and intercity buses ===
The first buses of the Solaris Urbino family were designed by a group of Polish engineers in collaboration with Berlin-based designer office IFS Designatelier under the leadership of Krzysztof Olszewski. In May 1999, at the Poznań International Fair Motor Show, the company unveiled its low-floor city bus MAXI class Solaris Urbino 12. Two other models of the MEGA class premièred that same year – the Solaris Urbino 15 and the Solaris Urbino 18. 2000 saw the market launch of the smallest member of the bus family – Solaris Urbino 9. A bodyframe made completely of stainless steel and the asymmetric front windscreen are turning into typical features of all buses of the Urbino family. The new series of city buses was characterised by the modern design and innovative technical solutions (e.g. the asymmetric line of the front windscreen improves the driver&#x27;s field of vision). The first generation buses were made chiefly for the Polish market. In March 2000 the company sold the first vehicle to a non-Polish company; the Solaris Urbino 15 went to DPO from the Czech city of Ostrava. The first-generation Solaris Urbino buses have also made it to Slovakia, Latvia, and Germany.

The second generation Urbinos premièred in 2002. The manufacturer introduced small modifications compared to the predecessors, so the second generation was a transition between the first and the third edition of the Urbino. What is more, the new Solaris Urbino 10 was introduced, replacing the Urbino 9. The year 2002 was also a historic moment for the company, as it marks the first time that export sales double and foreign orders exceed the volume of domestic commissions

2002 saw also the unveiling of the first Solaris intercity bus, dubbed Solaris Valletta for commercial purposes. The vehicle was designed for a regional operator, based in Valletta, Malta. It was the first right-hand drive Solaris bus model. 2004 saw also the début of the intercity low-entry bus model Solaris Urbino 12 LE.

In September 2004, the third generation of Solaris Urbino buses had its debut; serial production of those models kicked off in spring 2005. Many style and construction modifications were undertaken. It is this model that enabled the company&#x27;s global success internationally. Moreover, in 2004, the company presented also the Solaris Urbino 15 CNG model – the first Solaris bus running on compressed natural gas. The Solaris Urbino participated in a contest titled Bus of the Year 2005, where it came second, losing by a whisker to MAN Lion&#x27;s City. In 2006, Solaris became the first European manufacturer to present a serially produced hybrid drive bus – the Solaris Urbino 18 hybrid. In 2011 the company also launched a hybrid model of 12 meters.

In 2006 the company launched production of a 15 cm shorter model, 8.6 m long, i.e. the model Solaris Alpino, designed specifically for narrow streets of city centres and also less frequented communication routes. In 2008, the company extended the production line by two low-entry models, the Solaris Alpino 8,9 LE and the Solaris Urbino 15 LE. Also low-floor CNG- or biogas-fuelled models, designed specifically for buyers in Scandinavian countries, were launched around that time.

In mid-2009 the company designed the first prototypes of the intercity bus Solaris InterUrbino 12 which premiered in September 2009 at the Transexpo trade fair.

In September 2011, Solaris presented the prototype of the fully electric MIDI class city bus: the Solaris Urbino 8,9 LE electric. The first buyer of that electric Solaris bus was an Austrian carrier from Klagenfurt. A year later, at the IAA trade fair in Hanover, the producer unveiled the 12-metre version of its electric bus, the Solaris Urbino 12 electric. The first such model was sold in 2013, to an operator in Braunschweig, Germany. That is also, where the first articulated electric buses - the Solaris Urbino 18 electric - went to. In 2014 the producer supplied its innovative city buses Solaris Urbino 18,75 electric to Hamburg; these vehicles were the first to use a hydrogen fuel cell as an additional power source.

In September 2014, during the IAA trade fair in Hanover (world première), and in October that year, at the Transexpo trade fair in Kielce (Polish premiere), Solaris presented the new generation of Solaris Urbino buses – initially only with conventional drives and in the length versions 12 and 18 metres. This time, the producer introduced more modifications to the design compared to the predecessor buses. The design was profoundly amended and many technical innovations were applied. Over the next years, Solaris showed off a range of new generation models (the firm started using that name instead of the fourth generation, to distinguish it from the older model), though it continued to concurrently manufacture vehicles of the third generation.

In 2016 Solaris announced that the new generation Solaris Urbino 12 electric would compete in the “Bus Euro Test 2016” for the title Bus and Coach of the Year 2017. In the contest, the Solaris bus faced off against three competitors – the buses also evaluated in the test were the Mercedes-Benz Citaro C2 NGT, the Van Hool Exqui.City 18, the Irizar i2e and the Ebusco 2.01. Solaris turned out the final winner – thus becoming the first Polish bus to secure this title and the first electric bus ever to win this distinction.

Solaris supplies complete buses, i.e. it does not use the chassis of other manufacturers. However, it does implement components made by other sub-suppliers. It installs diesel engines and CNG engines made by Paccar/DAF, Cummins, whereas the transmissions are supplied by Voith or ZF Friedrichshafen. In the case of hybrid drives, Solaris vehicles use BAE Systems.

On 29 November 2016 Solaris became the leader of a technological cluster named “Polish Electric Bus - supply chain for electromobility”. The goal of the cluster is the design of electric buses, batteries and charging options. The cluster consists of: Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza (University of Science and Technology), Politechnika Poznańska (Poznań University of Technology), Politechnika Warszawska (Warsaw University of Technology), EC Grupa, Ekoenergetyka Polska, Impact Clean Power Technology, Medcom, Instytut Napędów i Maszyn Elektrycznych KOMEL and SKB Drive. Later on companies El-Cab and ENEA joined the cluster.

In 2019, a hydrogen-powered Solaris Urbino 12 hydrogen bus premiered at the UITP exhibition in Stockholm. In the same year, the first order for buses of this type was secured for Bolzano, Italy. In 2020, the manufacturer offer included the Solaris Urbino 15 LE, the first model of an electrobus designed for suburban and intercity transport, and the Solaris Urbino 12 mild-hybrid. In 2021, the Urbino 8.9 LE electric model was replaced by the new fourth-generation Urbino 9 LE electric. In the same year, the Solaris Urbino 24 electric MetroStyle 24-meter model was announced, based on a new platform of 24-meter electric, hybrid or as a trolleybus. In September 2022, Solaris unveiled its Urbino 18 hydrogen bus – the company&#x27;s second hydrogen bus.

=== Coaches ===
In the first years of operation, Neoplan Polska also handled the assembly of the coaches Neoplan Transliner and Neoplan Skyliner. Serial production of the tourist coach of the company&#x27;s own design Solaris Vacanza 12 began one year after the official unveiling in August 2001. The design of these coaches was drafted by the Berlin-based enterprise IFS Designatelier. A characteristic feature of these vehicles is the wedge-shaped bodywork line. Engines made by DAF were used for the driveline. In 2004, the company launched production of the longer model Solaris Vacanza 13. In 2003 the Solaris Vacanza was ranked second (&quot;ex aequo&quot; with the Volvo 9700) in the contest Coach of the Year 2004, right behind such brands as MAN Lion&#x27;s Star and Scania Irizar PB, which took the first place &quot;ex aequo&quot;. Due to limited sales, Solaris decided to eliminate them from its offer in 2011.

In 2002 Solaris assembled its first special purpose vehicle - a mobile blood donation station based on the Vacanza coach. Solaris bloodmobiles have been used in many Polish cities, but have also been sold to Riga. In 2018, Solaris presented the first fully electric special vehicle for blood donation, based on the Urbino 8.9 LE model.
=== Trolleybuses ===
Solaris Trollino trolleybuses have been produced since 2001, based on low-floor buses of the Solaris Urbino series. The first Trollino 12 units were created in collaboration with PKT Gdynia. In 2002, the company launched serial production of longer trolleybuses, namely 15-metre and 18-metre versions. The Solaris Trollino 15 was the first trolleybus in the world of that length. Originally, the vehicles were made with drives manufactured by Hungarian company Ganz Transelektro and Czech firm Cegelec. In spring 2007, Solaris and the firm Medcom from Warsaw decided to build a prototype of the trolleybus Solaris Trollino 12, fitted with an asynchronous drive made in Poland. It was created in August 2007 and was then submitted for tests in Lublin. Two more vehicles were made for public operator MPK Lublin. Tychy-based TLT, too, is authorised to assemble and obtain the type approval for the Trollino model.

Trollino trolleybuses are available in various length versions: 12-, 15- and 18-metre models. In Poland, the Trollino can be encountered on the streets of Gdynia, Tychy and Lublin. They are also used by the Rome trolleybus system (the battery version which enables driving in the city centre while detached from the traction line) and for the trolleybus systems in Riga, Vilnius, Tallinn, Landskrona, Opava and Ostrava. In 2009, the first Solaris trolleybus made it to Portugal, with the purchase of a single Trollino by the Coimbra system. The Solaris Trollino is also available in a special version with a &quot;MetroStyle&quot; bodywork that has an affinity to the style of the Solaris Tramino tram. Trolleybuses of that type have been supplied to Salzburg, Esslingen and Castellón de la Plana.

=== Trams ===

In March 2006 Solaris Bus &amp; Coach signed a contract with Bombardier Transportation and German firm Vossloh Kiepe on the assembly of trams in Poland. In 2006 these companies won a tender for the supply of 24 trams of the Bombardier NGT6/2 type for Kraków and 3 for Gdańsk. Under the cooperation agreement, Bombardier Transportation supplied the bodyworks and carriages, Vossloh Kiepe provided the electric fittings and Solaris ensured the delivery of the remaining components and the assembly of the vehicles, in collaboration with MPK Kraków. The assembly of the trams for Cracow took place in the tram depot Zajezdnia Podgórze. 2007 saw the delivery of three ordered vehicles to Gdańsk and of eight vehicles for MPK Kraków.

In mid-2009 Solaris presented the prototype of its own tram, named Solaris Tramino. Its debut took place on 14 October 2009 during the Trako trade fair in Gdańsk. Solaris scored its first commission for trams of its own design when it won a tender for the supply of 45 trams to the operator MPK in Poznań. The delivery of the vehicles started in July 2011 and ended in May 2012.

The second tender for Solaris concerned an order for 5 bi-articulated fully low-floor trams adapted to a 1000 mm track gauge, placed by Jenaer Nahverkehr – a public transport operator from the German city of Jena. The tram cars have been fitted with two driver cabins, three bogies, including four axles integrated with a 90 kW motor, and an air conditioning system for the passenger compartment. The trams were delivered in 2013. They were the first ones produced in Poland and sold to a customer in Germany. As part of the third tender in 2014, Solaris provided 18 tri-articulated trams riding on a 1100 mm track gauge to Braunschweig in Germany. These were the longest trams made by Solaris.

In August 2012 Solaris won a tender for the supply of 15 double-ended trams for the newly built tram network in Olsztyn. This vehicle has features such as traction batteries allowing for a short-distance ride without a connection to the traction line. These are also the least noise-emitting trams in Poland. The 15 vehicles were supplied in 2015.

At the beginning of February 2015 Solaris won a commission for the supply of 41 trams to the Leipzig-based public transport operator Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe GmbH in Germany. The new trams for the Saxon buyer have been given a completely new design, in compliance with the customer&#x27;s wishes. However, references to the former Tramino construction have been maintained. The longest vehicle of the family (37 630 mm) was named &quot;Tramino XL&quot;. The official première of the Tramino for Leipzig took place in February 2017, marking also the beginning of the delivery.

On 20 September 2016, at the InnoTrans trade fair in Berlin, the company announced that it had started cooperation with Stadler Rail – a Swiss rolling stock producer. The consortium won a tender for the delivery of 50 trams for public transport operator MPK S.A. from Kraków.

On 9 December 2016, Solaris announced the establishment of the joint venture Solaris Tram. The company started operation on 1 January 2017, with Zbigniew Palenica assuming the post of CEO, whereas the shares are divided between Solaris and Stadler Rail at a 40:60. In July 2017 Solaris Tram secured its first order, for the supply, to Braunschweig, of seven trams featuring a similar design as the vehicles from the previous contract.

== Company management and staff ==

=== Company management ===
Source:.
=== Number of employees ===
In the first year of operation there were 36 employees working in the production hall. In the following years, as new production halls were launched and production expanded, the staff number kept growing. In 2005 Solaris reported a headcount of 1000. As of 2022 Solaris employs 2700 people in Poland and in foreign agencies.

== Commercial symbols ==

=== Logo ===
Initially, Solaris did not have its own logo – it relied on the symbol of holding company Neoplan. The first logotype of Solaris was presented in 2001, when Solaris Bus &amp; Coach Sp. z o.o. was officially established. It featured a stylised inscription reading Solaris, enclosed in an ellipse. Moreover, for buses the company used a complex logo on a black background, where the letter O was replaced by a planet, whereas the letter A was set against a star in the backdrop. In 2005 a new graphic system for Solaris was shown. The company introduced the characteristic logotype resembling the letter S. In 2012 the company launched an overhauled version of the symbol making it bolder and changing the interior filling of the letter S. What is more, the stylised name Solaris, in line with the design from 2001, is placed underneath the graphic symbol.

=== Advertising slogan ===
In 2005 Solaris introduced its first advertising slogan: “Power of Enthusiasm”. It was in use until 2017, when the company replaced it with the slogan “Wspólny kierunek” (Polish for &quot;Common direction&quot;).

=== Green dachshund ===
The green dachshund &quot;(zielony jamnik)&quot; is the mascot of the company Solaris. It used to be attached to Neoplan Polska buses, distinguishing them from vehicles produced in other Neoplan factories. It was created by the company&#x27;s vice-president of the day, Solange Olszewska. The dachshund resembles a low-floor bus in shape, but it also symbolises the loyalty towards customers and low operating costs. The green colour is a symbol of concern for the natural environment. Its image is glued to the outside of the bus, usually on the front face, on the left side of the vehicle (when looking in the travel direction). A plush toy version of the symbol is often handed out during official release of buses to customers. In the case of the first and second generation and for some third-generation vehicles, the logo included the word “low-floor” written in the language of the country in question (e.g. “Niederflur” for Germany, “Нископодов” for Bulgaria or “niskopodłogowy” for Poland). In the case of low-entry buses, the inscription was changed accordingly to “low-entry”. Standard buses of the Urbino family (with diesel or natural gas engines) feature a dachshund logo in the basic form, whereas other drive or construction types have their distinguishing feature represented in the image of the dachshund, as shown in the table below: 
The green dachshund is also used as the logo of the company&#x27;s charitable foundation &quot;Fundacja Zielony Jamnik&quot;, established in 2012.

== Products ==

== Production and sales ==


Solaris buses have found buyers in over 700 cities in 34 countries in Europe, Africa and Asia (as of: 2022). The furthest Solaris buses have ventured from Bolechowo so far is the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Solaris has been leader of sales in Poland of new city buses with a DMC of more than 8 t since 2003 without interruption. The number of buses, trolleybuses and trams sold by Solaris was biggest for Poland (5528), Germany (2960), the Czech Republic (860), Italy (829), Sweden (616), France (523) and Norway (478).

=== Production facilities ===
The production of Solaris vehicles is handled in four production facilities situated in the vicinity of Poznań and in the city itself. The headquarters is located in Bolechowo-Osiedle. That is also where the final stage of production takes place. Furthermore, Solaris operates two plants in Środa Wielkopolska and one in Poznań. According to company plans, within the framework of the joint-venture of Solaris and Stadler Rail, as of 2019 the final assembly of Solaris Tramino trams is to be executed in the Stadler Polska plants located in Siedlce. In 2017 Solaris launched yet another plant – the Solaris Logistics Center – located in Jasin near Poznań. The new distribution centre and spare part warehouse was to streamline the order implementation process and raising the level of after-sales customer care.

==== Bolechowo-Osiedle ====

The factory in Bolechowo-Osiedle is the biggest production facility of Solaris. That is where the final stage of bus production takes place. Opened in 1996, is the oldest factory of Solaris, created for the execution of an order for buses for MPK Poznań. In 2014 the company started expanding the factory, adding additional production and office space. The following extension of that facility began in 2018. Annual output amounts to 1300–1400 vehicles, meaning that every day 5 to 8 new buses roll off the assembly line in Bolechowo. The average production time for one city bus is approx. 20 working days. Offices are located next to the production hall, constituting the headquarters of Solaris Bus &amp; Coach. Since 2016, it is possible to sneak a peek at the interior of the factory and the office building in Bolechowo using Google Street View.

==== Środa Wielkopolska ====
The facility in Środa Wielkopolska specialises in the production of steel bodyframes for buses and rolling stock. Solaris bought the factory in 1998, following the bankruptcy of the former owner, TRAMAD. The facility in Środa Wielkopolska employs about 360 people. About 8 bodyframes are completed here every day. In 2018, the company started the concurrent extension of the steel structure plant in Środa Wielkopolska and the plant in Bolechowo.

The second production hall in Środa Wielkopolska was launched in 2009, to serve the needs of orders for Solaris Tramino trams for the public transport operator MPK Poznań. Specialising in tram bodyframes, this particular facility caters only for the production of Tramino trams.

==== Poznań ====
The factory in Poznań at Wieruszewska street is a facility focusing on the production of rolling stock, where the final assembly of Solaris Tramino trams takes place. Just like the plant in Środa Wielkopolska, this facility was built to handle orders placed by MPK Poznań. Earlier prototype models of trams were manufactured in production halls of external firms.

=== Biggest orders ===

==== E.THE.L Athens ====
At the beginning of 2008 the municipal bus operator from Athens, E..THE.L, issued an invitation to tender for 320 city buses – namely 220 MIDI-class and 100 MAXI-class vehicles. Solaris’ bid was singled out from among others and so, in July 2008, the company signed a contract for the supply of 100 Urbino 18 and 220 Alpino 8,6 buses. The contract value exceeded EUR 80 million. The deliveries were completed by the end of 2009.

==== Cotral Lazio ====
At the beginning of 2016, Solaris won a contract for the delivery of 300 suburban buses for the operator Cotral from the Italian region of Lazio. This contract was worth nearly EUR 110 million. Under this contract, Solaris supplied 12-metre buses of the Solaris InterUrbino category. The buses were provided with, among others, baggage holds, air-conditioning and rear-view reversing cameras. The drive consists of a diesel engine made by DAF.

==== BVG Berlin ====
In 2004 Solaris secured an order of Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe for the supply of 260 city buses of the MEGA class (130 + 130 under a contractual option). Following this contract, there are now 260 low-floor Solaris Urbino 18 buses of the third generation driving on the streets of Berlin. They joined 10 older Urbino 18 buses of the previous generation, already in use in the city.

==== RTA Dubai ====
Towards the end of 2006 the Dubai Roads &amp; Transport Authority (the municipal transport operator in Dubai) put out a tender for the supply of a total of 620 city buses, although the order was divided into several batches. One of these batches, covering 225 vehicles, was won by Solaris. The contract entailed the delivery of 150 articulated Urbino 18 buses and 75 Urbino 12 buses of the third generation. The deliveries of buses were spread in time, from the end of 2007 and over the first half of 2008. One novelty applied in the buses for the Dubai RTA was a more efficient air-conditioning system and systems protecting the engine from sand storms. Special curtains of cool air have been applied in the buses, too, to prevent heat from entering the bus through open doors.

==== SWRT Wallonia ====
Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport (regional carrier of the Belgian region of Wallonia) ordered 208 hybrid buses of Solaris in 2017. Under the EUR 105 million commission the producer supplied Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid buses of the 4 generation. The deliveries were spread over a period of two years – 97 buses were supplied in 2017 and another 111 were shipped over in 2018.

==== MZA Warsaw ====
In March 2019, Solaris won the tender organized by MZA Warsaw, the subject of which was the delivery of 130 electric buses. The contract was signed on July 22, 2019. The vehicles will take to the streets of Warsaw in 2019 and 2020. The contract is worth PLN 399.5 million (roughly 89.5 million euro) and was the largest electric bus order to date in Europe. Solaris submitted the only tender.

==== ATM Milan ====
In July 2019, Solaris won an order for the supply of 250 electric buses with a length of 12 m for a carrier from Milan, winning the bid against Mercedes. It was a tender for electric buses worth up to EUR 192 million.

<doc id="719150" wikidata="Q423372" url="?curid=719150" title="Coffinite">
<text>Coffinite is a uranium-bearing silicate mineral with formula: U(SiO4)1−x(OH)4x.

It occurs as black incrustations, dark to pale-brown in thin section. It has a grayish-black streak. It has a brittle to conchoidal fracture. The hardness of coffinite is between 5 and 6.

It was first described in 1954 for an occurrence at the La Sal No. 2 Mine, Beaver Mesa, Mesa County, Colorado, US, and named for American geologist Reuben Clare Coffin (1886–1972).
It has widespread global occurrence in Colorado Plateau-type uranium ore deposits of uranium and vanadium. It replaces organic matter in sandstone and in hydrothermal vein type deposits. It occurs in association with uraninite, thorite, pyrite, marcasite, roscoelite, clay minerals and amorphous organic matter.

==Composition==
Coffinite&#x27;s chemical formula is U(SiO4)1−x(OH)4x. X-ray powder patterns from samples of coffinite allowed geologists to classify it as a new mineral in 1955. A comparison to the x-ray powder pattern of zircon (ZrSiO4) and thorite (ThSiO4) was the basis for this classification. Preliminary chemical analysis indicated that the uranous silicate exhibited hydroxyl substitution. The results of Sherwood&#x27;s preliminary chemical analysis were based on samples from three locations. Hydroxyl bonds and silicon-oxygen bonds also proved to exist after infrared absorption spectral analyses were performed. The hydroxyl substitution occurs as (OH)44− for (SiO4)4−. The hydroxyl constituent in coffinite later proved to be nonessential in the formation of a stable synthetic mineral. Recent electron microprobe analysis of the submicroscopic crystals uncovered an abundance of calcium, yttrium, phosphorus, and minimal lead substitutions along with traces of other rare earth elements.

==Crystal structure==
Coffinite is isostructural with the orthosilicates zircon (ZrSiO4) and thorite (ThSiO4). Stieff et al. analyzed coffinite using the x-ray powder diffraction technique and determined that it has a tetragonal structure. Occurring naturally with U4+ cations, the UO8 triangular dodecahedra coordinate with edge-sharing, alternating SiO4 tetrahedra in chains along the c-axis. The central uranium site of coffinite is surrounded by eight SiO4 tetrahedra. The lattice dimensions of naturally-occurring and synthetic coffinite are similar, with a naturally-occurring sample from Arrowhead Mine, Mesa County, Colorado having a=6.93kx, c=6.30kx, and a sample synthesized by Hoekstra and Fuchs having a=6.977kx and c=6.307kx.

==Physical properties==
Initial examination of coffinite by Stieff et al. described the mineral as black in color with an adamantine luster, indistinguishable from uraninite (UO2). Additionally, the discoverers reported that although no cleavage is seen in coffinite, it does exhibit subconchoidal fracturing and is very fine grained. Initial samples showed a brittle texture and a hardness between 5 and 6, with a specific gravity of 5.1. Later samples from Woodrow Mine in New Mexico collected by Moench showed fibrous internal structure and exceptional crystallization. A polished thin section of coffinite has a brown color and shows anisotropic transmission of light. Optical analysis yielded a refractive index of about 1.74.

==Geological occurrence==
Coffinite was first discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits in the Colorado Plateau region, but has also been discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits and hydrothermal veins in many other locations. Samples of coffinite from the Colorado Plateau were found with black fine-grained low-valence vanadium minerals, uraninite and finely dispersed black organic material. Other materials associated with later finds from the same region were clay and quartz. In vein deposits of the Copper King Mine in Colorado, coffinite was also found to occur with uraninite and pitchblende. Coffinite is metastable compared to uraninite and quartz, thus formation of coffinite requires a uranium source in reducing conditions, as evidenced by the associated presence of low-valence vanadium minerals. Silica-rich solution provides such a reducing condition in cases where coffinite results as an alteration product of uraninite. Hansley and Fitzpatrick also noted that the brownish color of their coffinite samples was caused by organic material, leading them to conclude that coffinite can also form in low temperature conditions if organic carbon is present. This finding is consistent with the coffinite samples of the Colorado Plateau, which included fossilized wood. In China, coffinite can be found in granite in addition to sandstone. Hansley and Fitzpatrick concluded that coarse-grained coffinite most likely forms in high temperature environments. Coffinite and uraninite precipitate inside brecciated and fractured regions of altered granite at pressures between 500 and 800 bars and temperatures at 126 to 178 °C.

==Special characteristics==
A large percentage of the Earth&#x27;s uranium supply is contained in coffinite deposits, which is significant because of uranium&#x27;s use in nuclear energy. Sedimentary deposits contain the most radioactive samples, as evidenced by the intensely radioactive coffinite found in the Colorado Plateau. Researchers at Harvard University, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and several other institutions attempted unsuccessfully to synthesize coffinite in the mid-1950s after its initial discovery. In 1956, Hoekstra and Fuchs managed to create stable samples of synthetic coffinite. All of this research was conducted for the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

<text>The University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB; ), also referred to as UP Los Baños or colloquially as Elbi (), is a public research university primarily located in the towns of Los Baños and Bay in the province of Laguna, some 65 kilometers southeast of Manila. It traces its roots to the UP College of Agriculture (UPCA), which was founded in 1909 by the American colonial government to promote agricultural education and research in the Philippines. American botanist Edwin Copeland served as its first dean. UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and Diliman-based University of the Philippines (UP) units.

The university has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology due to its pioneering efforts in plant breeding and bioengineering, particularly in the development of high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977. Six of its research units are classified as Centers of Excellence in Research via presidential decree, and it hosts a number of local and international research centers, including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, World Agroforestry Centre, and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA).

UPLB offers more than 100 degree programs in various disciplines through its nine colleges and two schools, 29 of which are undergraduate degree programs. As of 2021, nine academic programs were recognized by the Commission on Higher Education as Centers of Excellence while one program was recognized as Center of Development.

UPLB alumni have been recognized in a wide range of fields. They include 16 scientists awarded the title National Scientist of the Philippines, members of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Palanca Award winners, as well as political and business leaders.

==History==

UPLB was originally established as the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (UPCA) on March 6, 1909, by the UP Board of Regents. Edwin Copeland, an American botanist and Thomasite from the Philippine Normal College in Manila, was its first dean. Classes began in June 1909 with five professors while 12 students initially enrolled in the program.

During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an internment camp for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army. For three years, the college was home to more than 2,000 civilians, mostly Americans, that were captured by the Japanese. In 1945, as part of the liberation of the Philippines, the US Army sent 130 11th Airborne Division paratroopers to Los Baños to rescue the internees. Only four paratroopers and two Filipino guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later, destroying UPCA facilities and killing some 1,500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards.

UPCA became the first unit of the University of the Philippines to open after the war, with Leopoldo Uichanco as dean. However, only 125 (16 percent) of the original students enrolled. It was even worse for the School of Forestry, which only had nine students. Likewise, only 38 professors returned to teach. UPCA used its ₱470,546 (US$10,800) share in the Philippine-US War Damage Funds (released in 1947) for reconstruction.

Further financial endowments from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) allowed the construction of new facilities, while scholarship grants, mainly from the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Cooperation Administration, helped fund the training of UPCA faculty. From 1947 to 1958, a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities.

Dioscoro Umali became UPCA dean in 1959. Umali&#x27;s administration oversaw the creation of IRRI, SEARCA (of which he was the first director), and the Department of Food Science and Technology. New facilities were also constructed under his Five-Year Development Program.

Cornell University was instrumental in the post-war rebuilding of UP&#x27;s Los Baños colleges. The Cornell-Los Baños project, implemented in 1952 to 1960, involved the rebuilding of UPCA&#x27;s physical plant and Central Experiment Station, procurement of scientific equipment, and upgrading of teaching standards. A similar undertaking between Cornell, Syracuse University, the State University of New York, and the UP College of Forestry was implemented between 1957 and 1963. A &quot;sister university relationship&quot; was formally established in 1962 through the UP-Cornell Graduate Education program, which sought to develop and expand UP&#x27;s agricultural education, research and extension programs, and to strengthen Cornell&#x27;s own international agricultural development program. The program ended in 1972.

The 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis under the Ferdinand Marcos government marked the beginning of a prolonged period of social unrest across the country, including in UP Los Baños. This period of unrest, which included the First Quarter Storm, coincided with another issue, which was the call for the UP College of Agriculture to become independent from the University of the Philippines in Diliman.

When martial law was declared in September 1972, Marcos cracked down on any form of criticism or activism, leading to the arrest, torture and/or killing of Los Baños residents. 

Those killed included student activists Alexander Mecenas Gonzales, Modesto &quot;Bong&quot; Sison, and Manuel Bautista, campus journalists Antero Santos and Alfredo Malicay, and botany teaching fellow Cesar Hicaro. Meanwhile, Chemistry instructor Aloysius Baes was among those who were arrested and tortured. Those who went missing (&quot;desaparecidos&quot;), meanwhile, included Tish Ladlad, Cristina Catalla, Gerardo &quot;Gerry&quot; Faustino, Rizalina Ilagan, Ramon Jasul, and Jessica Sales.

Later in 1972, UPCA formally requested Ferdinand Marcos to allow the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals. However, UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea. A survey also found that there was very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on November 20, 1972, Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP&#x27;s first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units. New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years, while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman.

The establishment of UPLB as an autonomous campus also saw the establishment of the UPLB Perspective as its student paper in 1973 – earning it the distinction of being one of the first student newspapers to be allowed to publish after the September 1972 martial law crackdown on newspapers and other media establishments.

Violent crime incidents in the UPLB community, with some resulting in the deaths of students (Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez in 1993, Given Grace Cebanico in 2011, Ray Bernard Peñaranda and Maria Victoria Reyes in 2012) were widely covered by the national media. As a result, national government agencies, the local government of Los Baños, and the university administration have enacted more stringent security measures.

In recent years, the government launched new construction projects in UPLB. These include the construction of a new main library, the Food Processing Research and Development Center, the Agricultural and Economic Development Studies Center, and a microbial bank for the BIOTECH Philippine National Collection of Microorganisms.

==Campus==

The UPLB campus consists of spread across the provinces of Laguna, Negros Occidental, and Quezon.
===Los Baños campus===
The Los Baños campus houses UPLB&#x27;s academic facilities, as well as experimental farms for agriculture and biotechnology research. The more prominent buildings in the Los Baños campus, such as the Dioscoro L. Umali Hall, Main Library, and Student Union were designed by National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin. Other notable landmarks include the iconic &quot;Oblation&quot;, Alumni Plaza, Freedom Park, and Baker Memorial Hall.

UPLB is designated as caretaker of the Makiling Forest Reserve (often referred to as the &quot;upper campus,&quot; in contrast to the &quot;lower campus&quot; set at the foot of Makiling). It houses facilities of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources, College of Public Affairs, UPLB Museum of Natural History and the University Health Service, among others. The reserve is home to diverse flora and fauna, and has more tree species than the continental United States (an area 32 times bigger than the Philippines). It serves as an outdoor laboratory for faculty and students of the university.

===Land grants===
UPLB has three major land grants: the Laguna-Quezon Land Grant, La Carlota Land Grant, and Laguna Land Grant.

The Laguna-Quezon Land Grant is located in the towns of Real, Quezon, and Siniloan, Laguna, and was acquired in February 1930. It covers some portions of the Sierra Madre mountain range, and currently hosts the university&#x27;s &quot;Citronella&quot; and lemongrass plantations. The La Carlota Land Grant is situated in Negros Occidental, a province in the Western Visayas region. Acquired in May 1964, it houses the PCARRD-DOST La Granja Agricultural Research Center, which serves as a research center for various upland crops. Meanwhile, the Laguna Land Grant located in Paete, Laguna, also acquired in 1964, is mostly undeveloped. Numerous parties have expressed interest in developing the land grants; however, UPLB has not entertained the potential investors due to the &quot;lack of a solid development plan.&quot;

===Panabo Professional School===
The UP Professional School for Agriculture and the Environment (UP PSAE) in Panabo City was established in 2016 to cater to agribusiness professionals in the Davao metropolitan area. Supervised by the UPLB Graduate School, UP PSAE was established through a grant by Damosa Land Inc., a leading property developer in Mindanao.

==Organization and administration==

As part of the University of the Philippines System, UPLB is governed by the 11-person UP Board of Regents, which is jointly chaired by the head of the Commission on Higher Education and the UP president.

The Board of Regents has the authority to approve the institution, merger, and abolition of degree programs as recommended by the UP president. It also has the power to confer degrees. The UP president, who is appointed by the Board of Regents, is the university&#x27;s chief executive officer and the head of the faculty.

UPLB is administered by a chancellor who is elected by the UP Board of Regents to a three-year term. The chancellor may only serve for up to two terms. Under him are six vice-chancellors specializing in academic affairs, administration, community affairs, planning and development, research and extension, and student affairs.

The current chancellor is Dr Jose Camacho, the tenth to hold the office.

UPLB, through the UP System, is a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities, a consortium of leading research universities in the Asia-Pacific region.

===Student government===
The University Student Council (USC) is the &quot;highest governing body of all UPLB students.&quot; Together with college student councils (CSCs), it assembles as the Student Legislative Chamber and acts as the highest policy-making body of the USC. The USC is composed of a chairperson, vice-chairperson, 10 councilors, a representative for each college/school with less than 500 students, and an additional college representative for every 500 students in excess of the first 500. Members are given one-year terms. CSCs have a similar structure, but with a different number of councilors based on the student population.

The Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT), under the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (OVCSA), is responsible for sanctioning erring students. Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles. The SDT is composed of a chairperson, two appointees of the chancellor, a student juror, and a parent juror.

==Academics==

UPLB offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs through its nine colleges and two schools. Most of these programs award science degrees. It also awards high school diplomas through the University of the Philippines Rural High School (UPRHS), a subunit of the College of Arts and Sciences, which acts as a laboratory for its BS Math and Science Teaching students.

===Admission and graduation===
UPLB admits more than 2,500 students and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission is determined by the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the &quot;standard&quot; cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the &quot;actual&quot; cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010 and 2011, UPLB had a &quot;standard&quot; UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the &quot;actual&quot; cut-off was 2.8. But in 2014 and 2015, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.

High school freshman admission, on the other hand, is determined by the eight-hour-long UPRHS Entrance Examination. Only the top 125 examinees are admitted. Sophomore transferees take the two-day UPRHS Validation Examination, and are admitted depending on the available slots.

Normally, a student who completes the program may graduate with honors if his general weighted average (GWA) is 1.75 or above. The title &quot;summa cum laude&quot; is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1.20 or above, &quot;magna cum laude&quot; to graduates with a GWA of 1.45 to 1.20, and &quot;cum laude&quot; to graduates with a GWA of between 1.75 and 1.45. As of 2011 there have been 30 &quot;summa cum laude&quot;s who have graduated from UPLB.

===Tuition and financial aid===
With the passage of Republic Act 10931, tuition and fees have been waived for students pursuing their degrees for the first time in exchange for return service, although it is possible to opt out and pay the full tuition instead.

Before this law was passed, the base tuition fee per unit in UPLB was ₱1,000 (US$23). Along with other UP constituents, UPLB implemented the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP), wherein students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500) were charged the base tuition fee; students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) were charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit; those whose incomes fell between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) were charged ₱300 (US$7); while those whose incomes fell below ₱80,000 were not charged any fees. Those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 were charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit.

===Accreditation===
UPLB is identified by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence in Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering, Biology, Forestry, Information Technology, Environmental Science, Development Communication, Statistics and Veterinary Medicine, as well as a Center of Development in Chemical Engineering. Five undergraduate programs were given the ASEAN University Network-Quality Assessment certification: BS Biology, BS Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, BS Development Communication, BS Forestry and BS Agriculture.

===Libraries and collections===
As of 2007, UPLB&#x27;s 12 libraries, collectively referred to as the University Library, hold a total of 346,061 volumes. It periodically receives publications from United Nations agencies (including the UNFAO, UN-HABITAT and UNU) and the World Bank. It is a contributor to the International Information System for Agricultural Services and Technology, contributing nearly 30,000 titles between 1975 and 2010.

195,282 of these volumes are housed at the Main Library, while the rest are in unit libraries. The Main Library also houses theses, digital sources, and 1,215 serial titles, among other materials. It has a total floor area of and a seating capacity of 510, making it the largest library in UPLB.

One of UPLB&#x27;s unit libraries is the College of Veterinary Medicine-Animal and Dairy Sciences Cluster Library. It has 17,798 volumes and 198 serial titles, and a total floor area of . It claims to hold the largest collection on veterinary and animal sciences in the country.

UPLB manages the UPLB Museum of Natural History, which was established in 1976 at the foothills of Mt. Makiling. It holds over 600,000 biological specimens, including half of the specimens from the Philippine Water Bug Inventory Project, and a third of the Dioscoro S. Rabor Wildlife Collection. More than half of the specimens belong to the entomological collection. While most of its collections are in its main building, some are housed in other UPLB units.

==Research==
Six research institutes were named Centers of Excellence in Research via presidential decree: Institute of Plant Breeding, Institute of Food Science and Technology, Institute of Animal Science, National Crop Protection Center, Farming Systems and Soil Resources Institute, and National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.

UPLB hosts a number of international research institutes, including the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture, the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, the International Rice Research Institute, the World Fish Center, the World Agroforestry Center, and the Asia Rice Foundation. The APEC Center for Technology Exchange and Training for Small and Medium Enterprises (ACTETSME), established in 1996 through the initiative of then President Fidel V. Ramos during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders&#x27; Meeting in Seattle, USA, is also located at the university&#x27;s Science &amp; Technology Park. Local research institutions such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources&#x27; Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau, Department of Science and Technology&#x27;s Forest Products Research and Development Institute, and Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Philippine Carabao Center are headquartered or have offices at the university. The main office of IRRI&#x27;s Philippine counterpart, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, used to be located at UPLB but was transferred to Muñoz, Nueva Ecija in 1990. It continues to maintain a research office at the university.

Three UPLB-published journals, the &quot;Philippine Agricultural Scientist&quot;, the &quot;Philippine Journal of Veterinary Medicine&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Environmental Sciences and Management&quot; are listed in the SCImago Journal Rankings. SCImago gave these an h-index (a measure of &quot;actual scientific productivity&quot; and &quot;apparent scientific impact&quot;) of 18, 6, and 12, respectively. These journals are also listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge, along with two other UPLB-published journals: the &quot;Philippine Entomologist&quot; and the &quot;Philippine Journal of Crop Science&quot;.

===Biotechnology research===
One of the earliest innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.

Research in the 1960s allowed for the efficient mass production of &quot;macapuno&quot; (a type of coconut with jelly-like meat), while studies started in 1998 that produced delayed-ripening papaya continue to this day. The research is credited for the increase in Philippine papaya production, with the production of year 2000 rising to in 2007. In 1974, UPLB researchers discovered mango flower induction by potassium nitrate, making it possible for the fruit to be available year-round. It is credited for tripling yield and for &quot;revolutionizing&quot; the country&#x27;s mango industry.

In 2009, UPLB researchers funded by the Department of Agriculture developed an abacá variety that is resistant to the abaca bunchy top virus. The virus, first detected in 1915 at Silang, Cavite, has since spread to various provinces in the country, and damaged more than of abacá plantations in 2002 alone. The university is working further to make it resistant to mosaic and abacá bract mosaic viruses.

In July 2010, UPLB announced that the &quot;Leucinodes orbonalis&quot;-resistant &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; (Bt) eggplant variety that it had been developing with Cornell University and Mahyco was ready for commercialization. On February 17, 2011, Filipino and Indian Greenpeace activists trespassed UPLB&#x27;s Bay research farm and uprooted two Bt eggplants and more than 100 non-genetically modified eggplants. The National Academy of Science and Technology and ranking UPLB officials condemned the incident, and have taken legal action.

===Biofuel research===
Pioneering efforts in biofuel research have been conducted at the university. Studies conducted in the 1930s found that gasoline with 15–20 percent ethanol, dubbed &quot;gasanol&quot;, was more efficient than pure gasoline. Biofuel research in 2007 under the National Biofuel Program has considered new sources of biofuel, such as coconuts, &quot;Moringa oleifera&quot;, and sunflower seeds. Efforts have been concentrated on the &quot;Jatropha curcas&quot; due to its low maintenance and fast yield. Other fuel, such as coconut biofuel, were found to be too costly. Biofuel from &quot;Sorghum bicolor&quot;, &quot;Manihot esculenta crantz&quot; and &quot;Chlorella vulgaris&quot; are also being studied.

===Nanotechnology research===
UPLB&#x27;s nanotechnology program focuses on research and innovation in agriculture, food, and forest products. It has developed nanosensors and nanostructured materials from agriculture by-products, helping improve agricultural productivity. Moreover, it has developed and commercialized &quot;nanofertilizers&quot; that can be substituted for synthetic fertilizers. Researchers found that these nanofertilizers reduced fertilizer application by up to 50 percent compared with using conventional fertilizers, and are less likely to cause soil toxicity and imbalance. Studies showed that using the nanofertilizers increased the net profit of farmers by 40 percent in rice, 20 percent in corn, and 48 percent in potato. It also increased eggplant yield by 36 percent, cabbage by 5 percent, and cane tonnage by 46 percent. Significant increases in yield were also observed for coffee, cacao, and banana. In 2021, the government launched a program to optimize the manufacturing of these nanofertilizers.

In 2008, 2,170 students were housed in the eight dormitories managed by UPLB. In the academic year 2011–2012, fees for all UPLB dormitories increased by at least 25 percent from the previous rate of ₱350 (US$8) a month. As with the previous dormitory fee increase of 221 percent in 1997, making the dormitories &quot;financially self-supporting&quot; was one of the reasons cited by the University Housing Office for the revision. The move was widely criticized by various groups. The University Housing Office projects ₱13,818,000 (US$322,000) in revenue for 2010 with a deficit of ₱586,465.59 (US$13,600). according to official estimates. UPLB is currently building two new dormitories with of floor area. The new dormitories are expected to accommodate 192 persons annually. In 2023, the historic Old Men&#x27;s Dorm, referred to as Unit 1, was demolished. 
===Student organizations===
As of May 2020, there are 159 recognized student organizations in UPLB. Of these, 68 are academic, 15 cultural, one international, eight religious, 30 socio-civic, six sports and recreational, 11 varsitarian, 13 fraternities, and 7 sororities. There are also a number of organizations that exist but are not officially recognized by the university. Regional organizations were not recognized by UPLB prior to September 2008, when the University of the Philippines board of regents repealed Chapter 72 Article 444 of the 1984 University of the Philippines Code, which states that &quot;organizations which are provincial, sectional or regional in nature shall not be allowed in the University System.&quot; Likewise, Section 3 of the code states that &quot;the University of the Philippines System is a public, &quot;secular&quot;, non-profit institution of higher learning.&quot; Due to this, religious organizations have had some difficulty in getting recognized. Only recognized organizations are allowed to use UPLB facilities. The system of student organizations in UPLB is different from that of other UP constituents in that freshmen are not allowed to join any organization until they have earned at least 30 units.

===Loyalty Day===
Every October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, which has also become UPLB&#x27;s alumni homecoming. The celebration commemorates events in 1918 when more than half of students and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the Philippine National Guard for service in France during World War I. The volunteers never saw action as the Allied Forces signed an armistice with Germany during the same year, essentially ending the war.

===Feb Fair===
The university holds a major campus fair, known as &quot;Feb Fair&quot;, during Valentine&#x27;s week. The fair was initially held to express opposition to martial law under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who abolished student organizations and student councils.

===Media===
The &quot;UPLB Perspective&quot; is the official student publication of UPLB. The university administration has been repeatedly criticized for allegedly interfering in the selection process of its editor-in-chief. Other campus publications include &quot;UPLB Horizon&quot; and &quot;UPLB Link&quot;. Meanwhile, the College of Development Communication (CDC) publishes the experimental community newspaper &quot;Los Baños Times&quot;.

CDC runs the radio station DZLB 1116, the oldest educational radio station in the Philippines. Founded in August 1964 with a broadcast power of 250 watts at 1210 kHz, the station serves as a distance education tool and training facility. It currently operates through a five-kilowatt transmitter located near the main gate of the campus. The station was the 1994 recipient of the KBP Golden Dove Award for Best AM Radio Station as well as a Catholic Mass Media Award for Best Educational Radio Program in 2010.

==People==


People associated with the university include alumni, faculty, and honorary degree recipients.

Lasco, and Juan M. Pulhin. National Scientist Romulo G. Davide was given a Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2012 for &quot;his steadfast passion in placing the power and discipline of science in the hands of Filipino farmers&quot;.

Those currently in office include Senate President Migz Zubiri, House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Isidro Ungab, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, and Makati City mayor Abigail Binay. Trade and Industry Secretary Alfredo Pascual was a faculty member prior to his appointment.

Both of its honorary degree recipients held influential roles in their respective countries&#x27; politics. They are Salim Ahmed Salim, former Prime Minister of Tanzania, and Sirindhorn, Princess of Thailand.

Former UP presidents Bienvenido Maria Gonzalez (1939–1943; 1945–1951), Emil Q. Javier (1993-1999) and Emerlinda R. Roman (2005-2011) graduated from UPLB, along with the sitting chancellors of UP Baguio, UP Mindanao, and UP Open University. Alumni who held ranking posts at other academic and research institutions include Jikun Huang, Founder and Director of the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kyu-Seong Lee, Director-General of South Korea&#x27;s Rural Development Administration, and Weerapon Thongma, President of Maejo University in Thailand.

<doc id="719157" wikidata="Q3775898" url="?curid=719157" title="Geraldine Kennedy">
<text>Geraldine Kennedy (born 1 September 1951) is an Irish journalist and politician who served as the first female editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; newspaper. She previously served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1987 to 1989.

In 1982, Kennedy&#x27;s telephone, along with those of two other journalists, was tapped by former Minister for Justice Seán Doherty. The revelation in 1992 that Charles Haughey had ordered the phone taps led to Haughey&#x27;s resignation as Taoiseach.

==Early career==
Kennedy studied at Dublin Institute of Technology and began her journalistic career with a regional newspaper, the &quot;Munster Express&quot;. She moved to the &quot;Cork Examiner&quot; after less than a year, but spent only a few years there before joining &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

On the foundation of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; in 1980, Kennedy joined it as the paper&#x27;s political correspondent. The paper&#x27;s publisher, John Mulcahy, had become familiar with Kennedy when she had contributed to his journal &quot;Hibernia&quot;. When the &quot;Tribune&quot; briefly ceased production, Kennedy moved to the &quot;Sunday Press&quot;.

Early in 1987, Kennedy successfully sued the incumbent Charles Haughey-led Fianna Fáil government for illegally tapping her phone.

==Political career==
Kennedy stood in the 1987 general election as a candidate for the newly formed Progressive Democrat party in Dún Laoghaire. She came third in the poll, winning 9.4% of the first-preference vote. She was one of fourteen Progressive Democrat TDs elected to Dáil Éireann in that election — a feat the party never achieved again. Kennedy was appointed the party&#x27;s spokesperson for foreign affairs.

She stood again in the 1989 general election and won 9% of the first-preference vote but failed to retain her seat.

==Return to journalism==
Following her election defeat, Kennedy returned to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, then edited by Conor Brady, whom she had worked with at the &quot;Tribune&quot; when he was the editor. She avoided party-political journalism for several years, but she returned to covering politics in the early 1990s, and became &quot;The Irish Times&quot;&#x27; political editor in 1999. She became the newspaper&#x27;s first female editor upon the departure of Conor Brady in late 2002. One of her rivals for the editor&#x27;s chair was the paper&#x27;s high-profile columnist, Fintan O&#x27;Toole.

Kennedy was paid more than the editor of Britain&#x27;s top non-tabloid newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, which has a circulation of about nine times that of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Later columnist Fintan O&#x27;Toole told the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;: &quot;We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double-standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.&quot;

In September 2006, Kennedy approved the publication of an article in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; giving confidential details of investigations being made into payments purported to have been made in 1993 to Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Kennedy refused, upon request of the investigating Tribunal, to provide details of the source of the printed information. She responded that the documents had since been destroyed. Her refusal caused the Tribunal to seek High Court orders compelling her to provide details of the source. On 23 October 2007, the High Court granted the orders compelling her to go before the Tribunal and answer all questions. In its judgment, the High Court, criticising her decision to destroy the documents, said it was an &quot;astounding and flagrant disregard of the rule of law&quot;. In 2009, however, the Supreme Court overturned this ruling, holding that the High Court had not struck the correct balance between the journalists’ right to protect their source and the tribunal&#x27;s right to confidentiality.

Kennedy announced on 12 March 2011 her intention to retire from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; by September, after a nine-year term as editor. She actually retired in June, and was succeeded by news editor, Kevin O&#x27;Sullivan, who succeeded her as editor on 23 June 2011.

In August 2012, she was appointed adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Limerick.
She has been awarded five honorary doctorates from Irish universities.

<doc id="719178" wikidata="Q84020" url="?curid=719178" title="Order of the White Eagle (Poland)">
<text>The Order of the White Eagle () is the highest honour of the Republic of Poland and formerly the Second Polish Republic and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and one of the oldest state decorations in the world still in use. It was officially instituted on 1 November 1705 by Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, and bestowed on eight of his closest diplomatic and political supporters. It has since been awarded to the most distinguished Poles for their merits and occasionally to the heads of state of foreign countries. 

The Order of the White Eagle is attached to an azure sash slung over the left shoulder to the right side. The star of the Order, formerly embroidered, is worn on the left side of the chest. Unlike other Polish high decorations, the Order of the White Eagle does not have different classes or crosses.

==History==
The badge of the Order of the White Eagle was originally a red enamel oval gold medal with an image of the Polish white eagle on its front side, and the royal cypher of Augustus II the Strong over crossed swords on the obverse, worn on a light blue ribbon. The white eagle badge was replaced by a Maltese cross badge in 1709. By 1713 it was worn from the neck, with a blue sash, and a star. Augustus limited the number of knights to 72, but only conferred the Order 40 times before his death in 1733. His son, Augustus III, however, awarded the Order more than three hundred times. Augustus may have been inspired to found the Order by the example of Peter the Great&#x27;s recent founding of the Russian Order of Saint Andrew (of which he himself had been made one of the first knights by the Russian emperor), and above all by the example of the prestigious French Order of the Holy Spirit, with which the light blue ribbon, and the star with a bird, have a strong resemblance, and which had also inspired Peter the Great&#x27;s Order of Saint Andrew.

Initially, the creation of the Order was strongly opposed by many of the Polish nobility, since membership in the Order conferred a distinction which violated the traditional equality of all Polish nobles. Since the Order had no patron saint, Augustus II made 2 August the feast of the Order. His son, Augustus III, however, changed the Order&#x27;s feast day to 3 August.

Under the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the Order was abolished. It was renewed in 1807 as the highest award of the Duchy of Warsaw, created by Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1815 to 1831, it was awarded in the Congress Kingdom of Poland.

After Russian troops put down the Polish uprising of 1830-31 in Congress Poland, the Order of the White Eagle was officially &quot;annexed&quot; by Nicholas I, and on 17 November 1831 became part of the Russian Imperial honors system. The insignia of this new Imperial Russian Order of the White Eagle was modified to more closely resemble those of Russian orders. It remained in this form until the Russian Revolution of 1917, in which the Russian Empire fell.

The Order of the White Eagle officially became Poland&#x27;s highest decoration by act of Parliament of 4 February 1921, and the insignia was redesigned. During the interbellum (1921-1939), the Order was awarded to 24 Polish citizens and 87 foreigners, among whom were 33 monarchs and heads of state, 10 prime ministers and 15 other ministers of state, and 12 members of royal families.

After 1948, when the Polish People&#x27;s Republic came into existence, the Order of the White Eagle was no longer awarded, but it was never officially abolished. It was also used by the Polish Government in Exile. Following the collapse of Communism, the Order was once again reinstated on 26 October 1992, the Polish Government-in-Exile having already presented the seal and archives of the Order to Lech Wałęsa. The first person to be awarded the White Eagle after its reinstatement was Pope John Paul II. The President of Poland as the country&#x27;s head of state is the Grand Master of the Order.

==1713 Insignia==
The 1713 badge was a Maltese cross enameled red with white borders with diamonds set in each of the balls at the eight points of the cross and with diamond set rays appearing between each of the points of the cross, i.e., a larger longer ray between each arm of the cross and a smaller ray between each of the two points of these arms. In the centre of the cross was a white enamelled eagle in high relief with spread wings and facing left and with a diamond set royal crown on its head. At the top of the cross between the two top points was a diamond studded semi-circular link through which passed a diamond studded ring through which, in turn, passed the light-blue ribbon from which it was worn. The reverse side of this Maltese cross was enamelled white with red borders and had at its center an oval gold medallion with the founder&#x27;s crowned royal cypher above two crossed swords taken from his arms as the Arch-Marshall of the Holy Roman Empire.

The &quot;star&quot; of the order consisted of an eight-pointed gold star with straight rays which bore a red-bordered white enamelled cross pattée with golden rays between the arms and with a golden rosette at its centre. The arms of this cross pattée bore the motto &quot;Pro Fide, Lege et Rege&quot; (For Faith, Law and the King) in golden letters.

The King of Poland could also wear the cross from a collar of 24 alternating links of white enameled eagles, crowned and holding scepters and orbs, and dark blue enameled ovals, surrounded by gold rays, bearing alternatively full-length enamelled images of the Virgin Mary crowned, dressed in pink and pale blue and supporting the Christ Child on her left arm and holding a gold scepter in her right hand and the letters of her name, &quot;MARIA&quot;, arranged into a stylized monogram in white enamel. This collar was made for the coronation of Stanisław II Augustus, the last King of Poland, but the coat of arms of the founder, Augustus the Strong, show the cross of the Order hanging from a collar of a very different design.

==Insignia during the Partitions==


The &quot;badge&quot; of the order consisted of a gold crowned double-headed eagle enamelled in black, with a cross superimposed upon its chest: this was a gold Maltese cross enamelled in red with white enamel outline and golden rays between the arms. A white enamel crowned eagle with spread wings, facing left (the coat-of-arms of Poland) was superimposed on the cross. On its reverse side the double-headed eagle bore in the center of its back a diminutive red-bordered white-enamelled cross pattée with a gold rosette at its center gold rays between its arms. The black double-headed eagle hung by its two crowned heads from an enamelled Russian imperial crown, which, in turn, hung from a dark blue silk moire ribbon.

The &quot;star&quot; of the order consisted of an eight-pointed gold star with straight rays; the central golden disc bore a red-bordered white enamelled cross pattée with a golden rosette at its center and golden rays between the arms, surrounded by a blue enamel ring bearing the motto &quot;Pro Fide, Lege et Rege&quot; (For Faith, Law and the King).

==Insignia after 1921==
The &quot;badge&quot; of the order consists of a gold Maltese cross enamelled in red with white enamel outline and with golden palmette-like rays between the arms. A white enamel crowned eagle with spread wings, facing left (the coat-of-arms of Poland) is superimposed on the cross. It is worn on a plain light blue sash. This design clearly reflects a return to the essential design of the 1713 badge, but without the diamonds of the earlier badge. The reverse side of the badge bears the same Maltese Cross with golden rays as the front side and this cross bears the same design as that of the star of the order (see below), except that the arms of the cross are not enamelled red, i.e., only the outline of the cross and its central disc with its surrounding oak wreath are enamelled. The &quot;star&quot; or &quot;plaque&quot; of the order consists of an eight-pointed silver star with straight rays, with a gold Maltese cross, enamelled in red with white enamel outline and with golden palmette-like rays between the arms, superimposed upon it. The motto of the order, &quot;Za Ojczyznę i Naród&quot; (&quot;For Fatherland and Nation&quot;), appears on the arms of the cross. The central disc is in white enamel with the monogram &quot;RP&quot; (Rzeczpospolita Polska) surrounded by a green enamelled oak wreath.

<doc id="719181" wikidata="Q4961146" url="?curid=719181" title="Brendon Batson">
<text>Brendon Martin Batson (born 6 February 1953) is a former professional footballer who played as a right-back. In his eleven-year career, he played for Arsenal, Cambridge United and West Bromwich Albion. Born in Grenada, he made three appearances for the England B team.

==Club career==
Born in St. George&#x27;s, Grenada, Batson moved with his family to Trinidad at the age of 6 and then migrated from the West Indies to England when he was nine years old in 1962. Until then he had never even seen a game of football and a teacher at his school, on watching his early efforts and reflecting on his birthplace opined, &quot;Well, perhaps cricket is your game.&quot; However, he was signed as a schoolboy by Arsenal, and whilst at the club&#x27;s academy won the FA Youth Cup of 1971. Batson signed as a professional at 17 years old at the club and eventually went on to feature for the Gunners&#x27; first team, becoming the first black player to do so. In all, he made 10 appearances for Arsenal, before moving to Cambridge United in 1974. He spent four years at Cambridge, captaining the side to the Fourth Division Championship under manager Ron Atkinson in the 1976–77 season. At Cambridge, Batson made a total of 163 appearances and scored six goals altogether.

When Atkinson moved to West Bromwich Albion in 1978, he successfully encouraged Batson to follow him and team up with fellow black players Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham, leaving in a deal worth £28,000. Although not by any means the first black footballers to play professionally in England, the players nicknamed &quot;Three Degrees&quot; by Atkinson, a reference to contemporary vocal trio of the same name, were pioneering, iconic and extremely popular with West Brom&#x27;s fans. This trio&#x27;s fame is to such an extent that in 2012 plans were put forward for a statue of which would honor the footballing trio being purposely displayed in October 2014 at The Hawthorns. The completed statue was publicly unveiled in New Square in the town on 21 May 2019.

Whilst a West Bromwich Albion player, he featured in a benefit match for Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players. He played 160 games for the Baggies before his career was cut short in 1982 by a serious knee injury.

==International career==
Batson was capped three times for the England B team against the United States, Spain and Australia.

==Administrative career==
Following the end to his playing days, Batson was thereafter appointed as the deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association in 1984. He then spent a total of 18 years in this position and remains as a trustee of the association. He later rejoined West Brom within the role of a managing director at the club, helping to form the West Bromwich Albion Former Players&#x27; Association in 2003. Batson in 2007, joined the Sports Grounds Safety Authority, then known at the time as the Football Licensing Agency (FLA). He is the longest serving member of the board of the authority.

==Personal life==
Married Pamela Hodgetts on the 20th September 2024. Batson’s first marriage was to Cecily, who died in September 2009. Batson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours
and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours, both for services to football.

<doc id="719187" wikidata="Q148920" url="?curid=719187" title="Abies nordmanniana">
<text>Abies nordmanniana, the Nordmann fir or Caucasian fir, is a fir indigenous to the mountains south and east of the Black Sea, in Turkey, Georgia and the Russian Caucasus. It occurs at altitudes of 900–2,200 m on mountains with precipitation of over 1,000 mm.

The current distribution of the Nordmann fir is associated with the forest refugia that existed during the Ice Age at the eastern and southern Black Sea coast. In spite of currently suitable climate, the species is not found in areas of the Eastern Greater Caucasus, which are separated from the Black Sea Coast by more than 400–500 km.

== Description ==
It is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to 55–61 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m. In the Western Caucasus Reserve, some specimens have been reported to be and even tall, the tallest trees in the Caucasus, Anatolia, the Russian Federation and the continent of Europe.

The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.8–3.5 cm long and 2 mm wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two blue-white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is usually blunt, often slightly notched at the tip, but can be pointed, particularly on strong-growing shoots on young trees. The cones are 10–20 cm long and 4–5 cm broad, with about 150–200 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds.

==Taxonomy==

The species is named by Christian von Steven after his compatriot, the Finnish zoologist Alexander von Nordmann (1803–1866), who was the director of the Odessa Botanical Gardens.

===Subspecies===
There are two subspecies (treated as distinct species by some botanists), intergrading where they meet in northern Turkey at about 36°E longitude:
* Caucasian fir (&quot;Abies nordmanniana&quot; subsp. &quot;nordmanniana&quot;). Native to the Caucasus mountains and eastern Pontic Mountains of northeastern Turkey west to about 36°E. Shoots often pubescent (hairy).
* Turkish fir (&quot;Abies nordmanniana&quot; subsp. &quot;equi-trojani&quot;). Native to northwestern Turkey, including the western Pontic Mountains as well as Uludağ and other mountains southeast of the Sea of Marmara. Often treated as a separate species, &quot;Abies bornmuelleriana&quot;. In Turkey this subspecies is treated as a distinct species (&quot;Abies equi-trojani&quot; ). It is endemic to a single location on Kaz Dağı (Mount Ida) in Balıkesir Province, northwestern Turkey. This subspecies occupies an area of only 164 km2 and is assessed as &quot;Endangered&quot;. Its shoots are usually glabrous (hairless).

== Uses ==
The Nordmann fir is one of the most important species grown for Christmas trees, being favoured for its attractive foliage, with needles that are not sharp and do not drop readily when the tree dries out.

It is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, and along with the cultivar &#x27;Golden Spreader&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

In Europe, the tree has also been used for reforestation as a way to mitigate expected forest decline caused by climate changes.

The wood is soft and white, and is used for general construction, paper, etc.

<doc id="719191" wikidata="Q60174" url="?curid=719191" title="Hermann Scherchen">
<text>Hermann Scherchen (21 June 1891 – 12 June 1966) was a German conductor, who was principal conductor of the city orchestra of Winterthur from 1922 to 1950. He promoted contemporary music, beginning with Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, followed by works by Richard Strauss, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, Edgard Varèse, later Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono and Leon Schidlowsky. He usually conducted without using a baton.

==Life==
Scherchen was born in Berlin. Originally a violist, he played among the violas of the Bluthner Orchestra of Berlin while still in his teens. He conducted in Riga from 1914 to 1916 and in Königsberg from 1928 to 1933, after which he left Germany in protest of the new Nazi regime and worked in Switzerland. Along with the philanthropist Werner Reinhart, Scherchen played a leading role in shaping the musical life of Winterthur for many years, with numerous premiere performances, the emphasis being placed on contemporary music. From 1922 to 1950, he was the principal conductor of the city orchestra of Winterthur (today known as Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur).

Making his debut with Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, he was a champion of 20th-century composers such as Richard Strauss, Anton Webern, Alban Berg and Edgard Varèse, and actively promoted the work of younger contemporary composers including Iannis Xenakis, Luigi Nono and Leon Schidlowsky.

He was the teacher of Karel Ančerl, Egisto Macchi, Marc Bélanger, Françoys Bernier, Anna Renfer, Frieda Belinfante and Karl Amadeus Hartmann, and contributed to the libretto of Hartmann&#x27;s opera &quot;Simplicius Simplicissimus&quot;. He also premiered Hartmann&#x27;s early work &quot;Miserae&quot;. Conductor Francis Travis was a pupil, then conducting assistant, for five years.

He is probably best known for his orchestral arrangement (and recording) of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;. His 1953 &quot;Lehrbuch des Dirigierens&quot; (Treatise on Conducting, ) is a standard textbook.

==Technique==

Like Vasily Safonov and (in later life) Leopold Stokowski, Scherchen commonly avoided the use of a baton. His technique when in this mode sometimes caused problems for players; an unidentified BBC Symphony Orchestra bassoonist told the singer Ian Wallace that interpreting Scherchen&#x27;s minuscule hand movements was like trying to milk a flying gnat. According to Fritz Spiegl, Scherchen worked largely through verbal instructions to his players and his scores were peppered with reminders of what he needed to say at each critical point in the music.

However, Scherchen did not always dispense with the baton. The film of his rehearsal of his edition of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; with the CBC Toronto Chamber Orchestra shows him using a baton throughout.

==Family==
Scherchen&#x27;s first wife – who was also his third wife – was Auguste Marie (Gustl) Jansen, whom he married on 17 June 1921. After a brief marriage to actress Gerda Müller from 1927 to 1929, he was again together with Gustl Jansen. In 1936, Scherchen married the Chinese composer Xiao Shuxian in Peking (Beijing). A daughter, Tona Scherchen, was born to them in 1938. She has also made a name for herself as a composer. The last of his five wives was the Zurich-based Romanian mathematics teacher Pia Andronescu, with whom he had five children: Myriam, David, Esther, Nathan and Alexandra.

He died in Florence, survived by a number of children from five wives and other women.

One of his sons was Karl Hermann &quot;Wulff&quot; Scherchen. Wulff met Benjamin Britten when they were thirteen (nearly fourteen) and twenty, respectively. Their romantic relationship did not begin until four years later. John Bridcut describes the passionate exchanges of letters between the increasingly-famous composer and the teenager in &quot;Britten&#x27;s Children&quot;. Wulff&#x27;s relationship with Britten is also the subject of Serenade for Tenor, Saxophone and Orchestra, a song cycle by Lyle Chan based on the romantic letters exchanged by the pair.

Until 2014, his daughter, Myriam Scherchen, co-ran the music label &quot;Tahra,&quot; which released officially authorized historical recordings of conductors such as Scherchen, Furtwängler, Mengelberg and others, generally drawn from primary recorded sources. Tahra ceased business after the death of the co-principal of the label, René Trémine.

The sister of Auguste Maria Jansen, Helene (Lene) Jansen, was married to the Hungarian cartographer Alexander Radó, who, under the alias &#x27;Dora&#x27;, was a member of the European-wide resistance organization known as the &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot;. When Radó was threatened in Switzerland by German security agents and faced eviction, Hermann Scherchen hid him in his apartment in Geneva.

==Recordings==
Scerchen&#x27;s recorded repertoire was extremely wide, ranging from the baroque to the contemporary, from Vivaldi to Reinhold Glière. His Mahler recordings, made before Mahler became a part of the standard repertoire, were especially influential; so too were his recordings of Bach and Handel, which helped pave the way for the period-performance practice movement. Included as well were significant recordings of music by Haydn, Beethoven, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Glière, Bartók, Schoenberg and many others.

* In 1953 Scherchen made the first commercial recording of Mahler&#x27;s 7th Symphony with the Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera. (Westminster WAL 211.) Surviving live recordings of Mahler&#x27;s 3rd and 7th Symphonies by Scherchen from 1950 pre-date the earliest commercial recordings of both symphonies.
* In 1959, Hermann Scherchen recorded Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, with Pierrette Alarie, soprano, Nan Merriman, contralto, Leopold Simoneau, tenor and Richard Standen, bass. (Westminster XWL 3306, WST 306)
* In 1959, Hermann Scherchen recorded Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, with Pierrette Alarie, soprano, Nan Merriman, contralto, Leopold Simoneau, tenor and Gustav Neidlinger, bass. (Westminster WST 304)
* In 1960, Hermann Scherchen recorded works by Max Reger with alto Margarethe Bence and the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, including &quot;Eine Lustspielouvertüre&quot; (&quot;A Comedy Overture&quot;), &quot;Serenade for orchestra&quot;, &quot;Romantic Suite for orchestra&quot;, &quot;An die Hoffnung&quot;, &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart&quot;.
* In 1996, Tahra published the only commercially released recording of Malipiero&#x27;s complete &quot;L&#x27;Orfeide&quot;. It was a remastered live recording of the 7 June 1966 performance at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence, conducted by Scherchen only five days before his death. The cast included Magda Olivero and Renato Capecchi (Tah 190/191).

<doc id="719194" wikidata="Q230615" url="?curid=719194" title="Kelly Rutherford">
<text>Kelly Rutherford (born November 6, 1968) is an American actress. She is known for her television roles as Stephanie &quot;Sam&quot; Whitmore on the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;Generations&quot; (1989–1991), as Megan Lewis on the Fox primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1996–1999), and as Lily van der Woodsen on The CW series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; (2007–2012).

==Early life and education==
Kelly Rutherford was born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, on November 6, 1968, the daughter of Ann Edwards. She has a brother, Anthony. She attended Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach, California. She later studied at HB Studio in New York City, and the Beverly Hills Playhouse in California.

==Career==
Rutherford began her career on daytime soap operas. She appeared on &quot;Loving&quot; in 1987, and later was cast as a regular on &quot;Generations&quot; from 1989 to 1991. In 1992 she joined the cast of the ABC drama &quot;Homefront&quot;.

From 1993 to 1994, Rutherford was a regular on the Fox series &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot; as Dixie Cousins, a saloon singer and con artist who has a brief romantic encounter with Brisco. In later episodes, Dixie becomes Brisco&#x27;s primary love interest.

She also appeared in the film &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;. She also starred in the short-lived series &quot;The Great Defender&quot; as Frankie Collet (1995), and in &quot;&quot; as Caitlin Byrne (1996). In 1996, Rutherford joined the cast of Fox primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, as Megan Lewis. She starred on the show until 1999.

She also starred as Christine Hamilton in the horror film &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000). From 2003 to 2004, she starred in the ABC drama &quot;Threat Matrix&quot; as Special Agent Frankie Ellroy Kilmer. In next television season she starred in another short-lived series, &quot;E-Ring&quot;, on NBC. In 2007, Rutherford began starring as Lily van der Woodsen in the CW series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. The series ended in 2012. Rutherford has also starred in a number of Lifetime movies. In 2016, Rutherford was cast in the ABC thriller &quot;Quantico&quot; playing the recurring role of Laura Wyatt. From 2018 to 2019, Rutherford played the recurring role of Melissa Daniels in the CW reboot series &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rutherford married Venezuelan banker Carlos Tarajano in June 2001. Rutherford filed for divorce in January 2002, after six months of marriage. The wedding was featured shortly thereafter in the February 2002 issue of &quot;InStyle&quot; magazine.

Rutherford married her second husband, German businessman Daniel Giersch, in August 2006. She gave birth to their first child, son Hermés Gustaf Daniel Giersch, in October 2006.

While pregnant with their second child, Rutherford filed for divorce from Giersch on December 30, 2008. Rutherford and Giersch subsequently became involved in a child custody dispute over their son and their unborn child. Rutherford gave birth to their second child, daughter Helena, in June 2009.

In August 2009, Rutherford and Giersch reached a temporary settlement of joint physical custody, in effect until April 2010. Rutherford also obtained a temporary restraining order against him the following month.

Giersch&#x27;s U.S. visa was revoked in April 2012, after Rutherford&#x27;s lawyer informed the State Department about issues pertaining to Giersch&#x27;s businesses, which led the department to conclude that it had sufficient evidence to deport him.

It has been reported that the allegations involved fraud or an involvement in drugs and weapons dealing in South America, considered terrorism under the PATRIOT Act. Giersch consequently was unable to enter the United States and took up residence in France and Monaco. In May 2012, Rutherford and Giersch&#x27;s children went to France to spend the summer with their father. Rutherford asked the court to grant her sole custody so that she could keep the children primarily in the United States following their visit to France, as the existing joint custody agreement required her to travel frequently to enable Giersch to spend time with the children.

In August 2012, in a widely reported decision, a California Superior Court judge ruled that the 50/50 custody arrangement should remain and that, because Giersch is unable to travel to the United States, the children should live in France with him and attend school there, with Rutherford traveling there to visit them. Though Rutherford opposed the decision and requested a stay of proceedings while she appealed, her request was denied and it was ruled that, in two years, his eligibility to enter the United States and the consequent well-being of the children will be reassessed.

In June 2013, Rutherford filed for bankruptcy, stating she had debts of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the $1.5 million she spent on legal fees relating to the divorce and custody dispute with Giersch.

In May 2015, Rutherford was granted temporary sole custody of her children, following a ruling that both her son and daughter be brought back to the United States from Monaco, where they had been living with their father since 2012. On July 23, 2015, a California judge ruled that California did not have jurisdiction over Rutherford&#x27;s child custody case because she resides in New York, and her former husband was again awarded custody.

Rutherford then filed a case in New York but on July 27, 2015, the New York court ruled it also did not have jurisdiction.

In December 2015, the Monaco courts reconfirmed that full custody remained with the children&#x27;s father, with Rutherford granted extensive visitation rights in France and Monaco as well as shared input regarding &quot;health, schooling, religious education, and any change of residence&quot;.

<text>Joseph Lawrence Mignogna III (born April 20, 1976) is an American actor, musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, podcaster, and game show host. He was a child actor in the early 1980s and portrayed Joey Russo in &quot;Blossom&quot; and Joe Longo in &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;. Lawrence also starred in &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; (1983–1987), and the series &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; with his real-life brothers Matthew and Andrew. His film appearances include &quot;Summer Rental&quot; (1985) and &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
Lawrence was born and raised in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He is the eldest son of Donna Lynn (), a personnel manager and former elementary school teacher, and Joseph Lawrence Mignogna Jr., an insurance broker. He is of Italian, English, and Scottish descent. His family&#x27;s stage surname was changed to &quot;Lawrence&quot; during his childhood when he started acting. He has two younger brothers, actors Matthew and Andrew.

Lawrence graduated from Abington Friends School in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, in 1994 and later attended the University of Southern California.

==Career==
===Acting===
In 1981, when he was five years old, Lawrence landed his first acting role in a Cracker Jack commercial. Three weeks before turning age six, he appeared on the March 31, 1982, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, where he performed the song &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; and tap danced.

After appearing in guest spots on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, Lawrence won the role of Joey Donovan on the hit NBC sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; in 1983. He continued in that role until the series ended in 1987. 1985 marked Lawrence&#x27;s theatrical debut with the release of &quot;Summer Rental&quot;. Lawrence provided the voice of Oliver, the protagonist in the 1988 Disney film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; at the age of 12. From 1991, at the age of 15, to 1995, Lawrence co-starred in the hit TV series &quot;Blossom&quot; on NBC, playing Joey Russo.

Lawrence has also starred in the series &quot;Brotherly Love&quot; (which featured his real-life brothers, Matthew and Andrew Lawrence) and &quot;Run of the House&quot; and has guest starred on such programs as &quot;American Dreams&quot; and &quot;&quot;. One of Lawrence&#x27;s film credits is &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; (2000).
In 2006, Lawrence appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Paired with professional dancer Edyta Śliwińska, he placed third in the competition.

In May 2007, he starred in the Broadway hit &quot;Chicago&quot; as Billy Flynn. He next hosted a dance competition show on The Learning Channel, &quot;Master of Dance&quot;, which premiered June 9, 2008.

In 2009, Lawrence starred in the television film &quot;My Fake Fiancé&quot; with Melissa Joan Hart, which premiered on ABC Family with 3.6  million viewers, becoming the most-watched television film the rating season, sweeping top rank in its time period in key demos. In August 2010, Lawrence returned to television in the ABC Family sitcom &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey&quot;, again opposite Hart. Hart plays a woman who hires Lawrence as a nanny to help care for her incarcerated sister&#x27;s kids. Lawrence&#x27;s character is a former figure in the financial industry whose company came under investigation for wrongdoing and caused his professional life to be put on hold. Lawrence&#x27;s brothers have guest-starred on the show. Matthew Lawrence played Tony Longo in season 1 episode 25 and Andrew Lawrence appeared in season 1 episode 26 as Ryder Scanlon&#x27;s teacher, Evan McKay. The series was renewed for its fourth season and ended in 2015.
In 2012, he was contracted to be a Chippendales dancer for a special engagement in June at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. On March 19, 2013, Lawrence began appearing in the ABC reality show &quot;Splash&quot;, co-hosting alongside Charissa Thompson.

In 2022, Lawrence competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Walrus&quot;. He was eliminated on &quot;90s Night&quot; alongside Le&#x27;Veon Bell as &quot;Milkshake&quot;.

In August 2023, Lawrence resurfaced his &quot;Blossom&quot; catchphrase, &quot;Whoa!&quot;, by starring in a VinFast&#x27;s VF8 ad campaign, covered by &quot;Automotive News&quot; and &quot;Ad Age&quot;. In December of the same year, Lawrence reprised his role in a second installment of VinFast&#x27;s &quot;Changing Lanes&quot; campaign.

===Music career===
Lawrence has said that music was always his passion, and at the height of his success began a recording career. Lawrence was 16 when his debut album &quot;Joey Lawrence&quot; was released in February 1993. Produced by Steve Barri, Tony Peluso, Terry Lupton, and Ian Prince. Lawrence co-wrote some material, including the international hit single &quot;Nothin&#x27; My Love Can&#x27;t Fix&quot; (#6 Billboard Hot 100 Airplay, No. 10 Billboard Top 40 Mainstream, No. 19 &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 13 United Kingdom, No. 68 Australia). The song was used as the end-title theme from the film &quot;Cop and a Half&quot;; its music video received heavy airplay on MTV and MuchMusic, and Lawrence was invited to perform live on MTV&#x27;s Spring Break, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, and the UK&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1993.

In June 2011, he released a single, &quot;Rolled&quot;, which was available as a free download for one week on ABC Family&#x27;s website. In July, Joey released a second single, &quot;Give It To Ya (Acoustic)&quot; via Pledge Music. In 2017 Joey started a band with Matt and Andy called Still 3. They released their debut single &quot;Lose Myself&quot;.

===Podcasting===
In 2023, Joey launched a podcast called &quot;Brotherly Love Podcast&quot; with his brothers Andrew and Matthew. It was launched through PodCo, a podcast studio launched by actress Christy Carlson Romano and focused on rewatches of completed television series by their former actors.

==Personal life==
Lawrence married Michelle Vella in 2002; the couple divorced in 2005.

He met his second wife, Chandie Yawn-Nelson, while on vacation in Disney World when the two were teenagers. They wed there in July 2005, and have two children, Charleston and Liberty. Reports surfaced in March 2018 that Lawrence and Yawn-Nelson had filed for bankruptcy in July 2017. On April 6, 2018, the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was reportedly settled. Lawrence filed for divorce in July 2020.

In 2022 Lawrence married actress Samantha Cope whom he met on the set the Lifetime television film &quot;A Deadly Deed&quot;, directed by his brother Andrew and co-starring his daughter Charleston. The couple has one daughter, born in 2023. On August 13, 2024, Cope filed for divorce. The following December, it was announced the couple had reconciled.

<doc id="719202" wikidata="Q1572629" url="?curid=719202" title="Igil">
<text>The igil (Tuvan: ) is a two-stringed Tuvan musical instrument, played by bowing the strings. (It is called &quot;ikili&quot; in Western Mongolia.) The neck and lute-shaped sound box are usually made of a solid piece of pine or larch. The top of the sound box may be covered with skin or a thin wooden plate. The strings, and those of the bow, are traditionally made of hair from a horse&#x27;s tail (strung parallel), but may also be made of nylon. Like the morin khuur of Mongolia, the igil typically features a carved horse&#x27;s head at the top of the neck above the tuning pegs, and both instruments are known as the horsehead fiddle.

The igil is held nearly upright when played, with the sound box of the instrument in the performer&#x27;s lap, or braced against the top of the performer&#x27;s boot. Playing technique involves touching the strings with the nails or fingertips, but without pressing them to the neck. The igil has no frets. The bow is held with an underhand grip.

The igil formerly had an entire genre dedicated to it, with a repertoire of songs meant to be performed only on the igil. During the communist period in Tuva attempts were made to &quot;modernize&quot; the igil. This was nothing more than an attempt to westernize the instrument making it more like the European cello. However the instruments and playing style used by most Tuvan musicians today are largely the same as the original form of the igil.

Famous players of the igil include Ak-ool Kara-sal, Andrei Chuldum-ool, Kaigal-ool Khovalyg, Igor Koshkendei, Mongun-ool Ondar, Aldar Tamdyn, Radik Tulush and Evgenii Saryglar.

<text>The Television Interface Adaptor (TIA) is the custom computer chip which, along with a variant of the MOS Technology 6502, constitutes the heart of the 1977 Atari Video Computer System game console. The TIA generates the screen display, sound effects, and reads the controllers. At the time the Atari VCS was designed, even small amounts of RAM were expensive. The chip was designed without the extra circuitry of a framebuffer, instead requiring detailed programming to create even a simple display.

Development of the CO10444/CO11903 TIA was led by Jay Miner, who continued at Atari expanding on the design of the TIA for the Atari 8-bit computers with the ANTIC,CTIA/GTIA and POKEY chips which allow for more graphical and sound capabilities. Miner later led the design of the custom chips for the Amiga computer.

==Design==
===Background===
Around 1975, Atari&#x27;s engineers at Cyan Engineering led by Steve Mayer and Ron Milner had been considering alternatives to the development dedicated hardware such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for arcade video games and home video game consoles. Programmable microprocessors had reached the market, but Atari considered them too expensive for a home application. They were limited by cost in options for displaying graphics. At this point in time, most computer graphics were generated by using sprites drawn atop a playfield, which then were translated into an analog signal for display on a CRT Sprites would be held as a bitmap in a framebuffer, requiring random-access memory (RAM). RAM was still expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars per megabyte., and to display a two-color playfield on a 80×48 display would have cost thousands of dollars in memory. On a conventional NTSC color television, maximum resolutions generally fell between 256 and 320 pixels per line, and 192 to 240 lines per screen.

In September 1975, MOS Technology introduced the 6502 microprocessor, one of the first low-cost microprocessors on the market. Mayer and Milner arranged to speak to the chip&#x27;s designer, Chuck Peddle, on using the 6502 as the basis for their programmable video game console. Over the course of a couple of days, the basic design of the Atari VCS was laid out, with Peddle offering Atari the use of the lower-cost MOS Technology 6507 processor and the MOS Technology 6532 RAM-I/O-Timer (RIOT) as the core of the design. Using a breadboard prototype for the display adapter atop a 6502 testbed system, Milner was able to demonstrate the ability to program a simple version of their &quot;Tank&quot; game. Joe Decuir was hired on to help convert Milner&#x27;s proof-of-concept to a functional prototype, sufficient for Atari to give the go-ahead for the development to continue.

While Decuir worked on the design of the rest of the system, Jay Miner focused on making an ASIC for the display adapter. Early on, the ASIC display adapter was named the Television Interface Adaptor (TIA). The cost of RAM remained high as the team began its design, and thus the option to use memory-based framebuffers was dropped from the TIA&#x27;s design.

===RAM-less design===
Due to the lack of RAM, the TIA differs from the conventional framebuffer approach on the screen is composed by manipulating five movable graphic objects (2 players, 2 missiles and 1 ball) and a static playfield object. These are all generated on every scan line from their respective registers, unlike the technique used in a framebuffer-mapped model, requiring the program to update these on every scan line. Horizontal resolution is not uniform, as its size depends on the particular graphics object. The smallest unit of pixel corresponds to 1 color clock cycle of the chip, of which there are 160 visible ones on a line.

The Playfield object consists of a two-and-a-half byte register (20 bits wide), which can be reflected symmetrically or copied as-is to the right half of the screen for 40 bits in total (each bit being 4 color cycles wide). The color that was drawn if the bit was a 1 or a 0 was selected from a pre-defined palette of up to 128 colors (see below) and held in other registers.

The TIA also supported five separate graphics objects consisting of:
*Two 8-pixel horizontal lines which make up the &#x27;sprites&#x27; Player 1 and Player 2. These are single color, can be stretched by a factor of 2 or 4, and can be duplicated or triplicated.
*A &#x27;ball&#x27; - a horizontal line that is the same color as the playfield. It can be one, two, four, or eight pixels wide.
*Two &#x27;missiles&#x27; - another horizontal line that is the same color as its respective player. It can be one, two, four, or eight pixels wide.

Without RAM-based framebuffers, collision detection is also complicated. The TIA has hardware collision detection for all of these objects through the use of 15 set/reset flip-flops and stores a bitmap of collisions, that are typically read during the VBLANK period. Registers in the TIA allow the programmer to control the positioning of the graphical objects and their color.

The TIA also provides two channels of one-bit sound. Each channel provides for 32 pitch values and 16 possible bit sequences. There is a 4 bit volume control.

Lastly, the TIA has inputs for reading up to four analog paddle controllers using potentiometers and for two joystick triggers.

===Drawing the display===
As the registers hold data for only a single line of the display, creating a full screen requires the game program to update the registers on the fly, a process known as &quot;racing the beam&quot;.

To start the process, the game program running on the MOS Technology 6502-based CPU loads the TIA&#x27;s registers with the data needed to draw the first line of the display. The TIA then waits until the television is ready to draw the line (under the command of the TIA&#x27;s associated analog hardware) and read out the registers to produce a signal for that line. During the horizontal blanking period between lines, the 6502 quickly changes the TIA&#x27;s registers as needed for the next line. This process continues down the screen.

This is made more difficult because the MOS Technology 6507 in the 2600 is a pin-reduced version of the 6502 with no support for hardware interrupts. Generally the analog side of the display system generates an interrupt when it finishes drawing a raster line and is getting ready for the next one. The interrupt triggers the code needed to update the screen, and then returns to the &quot;main&quot; program. The 6507 left these pins off of the CPU to save money, however it does have a &quot;RDY&quot; pin to insert wait states into CPU bus cycles. The TIA was specifically designed to use the RDY pin to synchronize the CPU with the raster line timing of the video generated by the TIA: when the CPU writes to a certain register address of the TIA, the TIA lowers its RDY output signal until the end of the current line, a &quot;wait for sync&quot; command. This suspends the operation of the CPU until the start (color clock cycle 0) of the horizontal blanking period right ahead of the next line, providing a measure of automatic synchronization. The intended use of this mechanism is for the CPU to run code that sets up the TIA registers for the line about to be drawn, and which usually runs to completion some time before the TIA reaches the end of that line. To make video timing synchronization easier, the CPU then writes to the register that triggers the synchronization delay via RDY, throwing away a variable amount of CPU time.

In addition, the TIA only semi-automatically generates vertical sync timing signals (to mark the end of each video frame and the start of the next). The TIA is capable of inserting a vertical sync signal into the analog output video signal, but it does not have a frame line-counter and so cannot tell when a frame should end. Instead, it is left to the CPU program to trigger vertical sync signals and to count the lines in each frame to determine when a vertical sync signal should be generated. Like for the RDY-wait hardware, the vertical sync signal is triggered by the CPU writing to a specific TIA register address. If no write to that address was ever done and the TIA was allowed to free-run, it would generate a single infinite frame of active raster lines, which would typically appear on the TV as a rolling picture. Most published games for the Atari 2600 generated vertical sync after either every 262 or every 263 lines (but nothing about the TIA prevents it from generating frames of any length, shorter or longer, though the resulting video displays would roll vertically on normal TVs).

These and other details of TIA programming mean that programmers need to time their programs carefully to run in the exact number of cycles needed for various screen-related events. Getting this wrong means the screen is not drawn properly. The part of a program that does this is known as the &quot;kernel&quot; of that program.

Given this complexity, early games using the system tended to be simple in layout, using the TIA to create symmetric playfields with players on top. This was the original intention of the system: to run the handful of arcade games Atari had already produced like &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;Pong&quot;. In these cases the playfield data was typically laid out in the 2 kB ROM memory in the game cartridge. As each line used 20 bits of data, and there were 192 lines on an NTSC display, a display with a different layout on every line needed only 480 bytes (192 x 20 / 8) of the cartridge&#x27;s 4 kB to hold a single hard-coded display. In this case the kernel simply advanced 20 bits through ROM for every line as the TIA advanced down the screen, a task that took only a few cycles of CPU time. This can be further reduced by using the same data for multiple lines, either doubling them vertically, or reading one way through the list for the top and then back the other way for the bottom, producing a vertically mirrored display of only 240 bytes.

A key advance was the licensing of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; for the platform, which required many more player graphics to draw the enemy aliens. The solution was to change the player data for every line as the image was being drawn, creating an apparent large number of players. Another advance was made by (partially) coding the display as CPU instructions instead of storing it as fixed data in ROM. &quot;Adventure&quot; uses this concept to produce a wide variety of maps by combining different portions of the data in ROM, jumping back and forth through it during the screen drawing. This allowed the game to have 30 rooms, which would have otherwise required 14 kB of ROM.

As programmers grew more accustomed to the odd timing needed to get things to work properly on-screen, they began to use the inherent flexibility in the TIA to greatly improve the displays. One common technique was to change the color registers that were used to draw the 1 and 0 states of the playfield, resulting in displays with rainbow-like effects. Later games could modify the playfield mid-line to generate asymmetric patterns, repositioning and changing player sprites mid-screen to generate additional sprites.

==TIA Color Capabilities==

The TIA uses different color palettes depending on the television signal format used. For NTSC format (part number CO10444), a 128-color palette is provided, while only 104 colors are available for PAL (part number CO11903). Finally, the SECAM palette consists of only 8 colors.

==Noise/Tone Generator (AUD0/1)==
The TIA is capable of generating different types of pulse waves and white noise output to its two oscillators (or channels) AUD0 and AUD1. Each oscillator has a 5-bit frequency divider and a 4-bit audio control register which manipulates the waveform. There is also a 4-bit volume control register per channel.

===Frequency Divider (AUDF0/1)===
Frequencies are generated by taking 31399 Hz (31113 Hz for PAL) and dividing by the 5-bit value supplied. 
The result is a cheap frequency divider capable of detuned notes and the odd tuned frequency. The TIA is not a musical chip unless the composer works within the frequency limits or modulates between two detuned frequencies to create a vibrato tuned note. The TIA is tuned to the inverted harmonic series due to each frequency being the base frequency divided by a whole number.

===Audio Control (AUDC0/1)===
The Audio Control register generates and manipulates a pulse wave to create complex pulses or noise. The following tables (with designed duplicates) explains how its tones are generated:

<text>In cryptography, Madryga is a block cipher published in 1984 by W. E. Madryga. It was designed to be easy and efficient for implementation in software. Serious weaknesses have since been found in the algorithm, but it was one of the first encryption algorithms to make use of data-dependent rotations, later used in other ciphers, such as RC5 and RC6.

In his proposal, Madryga set forth twelve design objectives that are generally considered to be good goals in the design of a block cipher. DES had already fulfilled nine of them. The three that DES did not fulfill were:

# Any possible key should produce a strong cipher. (Meaning no weak keys, which DES has.)
# The length of the key and the text should be adjustable to meet varying security requirements.
# The algorithm should be efficiently implementable in software on large mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers, and in discrete logic. (DES has a large amount of bitwise permutations, which are inefficient in software implementations.)

==The algorithm==
Madryga met the objective of being efficient in software: the only operations it uses are XOR and rotations, both operating only on whole bytes. Madryga has a variable-length key, with no upper limit on its length.

Madryga is specified with eight rounds, but this can be increased to provide more security if need be. In each round, the algorithm passes over the entire plaintext &quot;n&quot; times, where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the plaintext in bytes. The algorithm looks at three bytes at a time, so Madryga is a 24-bit block cipher. It XORs a key byte with the rightmost byte, and rotates the other two as one block. The rotation varies with the output of the XOR. Then, the algorithm moves to the right by one byte. So if it were working on bytes 2, 3 and 4, after it finished rotating and XORing them, it would repeat the process on bytes 3, 4 and 5.

The key schedule is very simple. To start with, the entire key is XORed with a random constant of the same length as the key, then rotated to the left by 3 bits. It is rotated again after each iteration of rotation and XOR. The rightmost byte of it is used in each iteration to XOR with the rightmost byte of the data block.

The decryption algorithm is simply the reverse of the encryption algorithm. Due to the nature of the XOR operation, it is reversible.

==Cryptanalysis==
At a glance, Madryga seems less secure than, for example, DES. All of Madryga&#x27;s operations are linear. DES&#x27;s S-boxes are its only non-linear component, and flaws in them are what both differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis seek to exploit. While Madryga&#x27;s rotations are data-dependent to a small degree, they are still linear.

Perhaps Madryga&#x27;s fatal flaw is that it does not exhibit the avalanche effect. Its small data block is to blame for this. One byte can only influence the two bytes to its left and the one byte to its right.

Eli Biham has reviewed the algorithm without making a formal analysis. He noticed that &quot;the parity of all the bits of the plaintext and the ciphertext is a constant, depending only on the key. So, if you have one plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, you can predict the parity of the ciphertext for any plaintext.&quot; Here, parity refers to the XOR sum of all the bits.

In 1995, Ken Shirriff found a differential attack on Madryga that requires 5,000 chosen plaintexts. Biryukov and Kushilevitz (1998) published an improved differential attack requiring only 16 chosen-plaintext pairs, and then demonstrated that it could be converted to a ciphertext-only attack using 212 ciphertexts, under reasonable assumptions about the redundancy of the plaintext (for example, ASCII-encoded English language). A ciphertext-only attack is devastating for a modern block cipher; as such, it is probably more prudent to use another algorithm for encrypting sensitive data.

<text>The Man versus Horse Marathon is an annual race over , where runners compete against riders on horseback through a mix of road, trail and mountainous terrain. The race, which is a shorter distance than an official marathon road race, takes place in the Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells every June. There are other Man versus Horse races — in Scotland based at Dores, near Loch Ness, in Central North Island, New Zealand and in Prescott, Arizona.

==History==

The event started in 1980, when local landlord Gordon Green overheard a discussion between two men in his pub, the Neuadd Arms. One man suggested that over a significant distance across country, man was equal to any horse. Green decided that the challenge should be tested in full public view, and organised the first event.

The first woman to run the race was Ann King in 1981. In 1982, the route of the course was amended slightly to give a more even match between the competitors. The course is slightly shorter than a traditional marathon at a reported 22 miles, but over rougher terrain. In 1985, cyclists were allowed to compete too – and that year, U.S. ladies&#x27; champion cyclist Jacquie Phelan narrowly lost to the first horse. In 1989, British cyclist Tim Gould beat the first horse by three minutes – the first time that a horse was beaten by a human in the race.

In 2004, the 25th race was won by Huw Lobb in 2 hours, 5 minutes and 19 seconds. It was the first time that a man racing on foot has won the race, thereby winning the prize fund of £25,000, which had been growing by £1,000 each year from the race&#x27;s inception until claimed by a winning runner. The year&#x27;s race also saw the highest ever number of competitors; 500 runners and 40 horses. The feat was repeated in 2007, when human competitors outpaced the first equine competitor by up to 11 minutes.

The 2009 race was marred by controversy when the organizers deducted time spent in the &#x27;vet checks&#x27; from the horse times in addition to the 15 minutes for the delayed start of the horses. The deduction of this additional time enabled the horse to triumph by 8 minutes, instead of being defeated by 2. Whilst the organizers at the time claimed that the time spent in the vet check (which is not accurately monitored on a horse-by-horse basis) had always been deducted, this had not occurred in previous years. The fastest runner, Martin Cox, refused to accept the winner&#x27;s trophy in protest at the decision. Following protests from other competitors, the organizers reverted to the previously followed rules of only deducting 15 minutes for the 2010 edition of the race. However, despite Haggai Chepkwony running the fastest time since Huw Lobb&#x27;s record-breaking effort in 2004, a horse triumphed by 10 minutes. 2011 featured a number of very good riders and horses competing, and the wet track conditions favored horses over runners, but some very good times were recorded by the front runners. The winning rider was Beti Gordon riding Next in Line at Grangeway, while the top runner was Charlie Pearson from London.

2012 saw the return of Huw Lobb, becoming the first runner to beat the horse and win the (accumulated) £25,000 prize money. His winning time was, however, considerably down on his winning time from 2004. Coming third in the Cork Marathon just five days earlier may have contributed to his running slower than perhaps he might have been able to. In 2013, extensive forestry works meant the organizers had to modify the route considerably, resulting in a course of nearly 24 miles, instead of the usual route of just under 21 miles. Despite a very hot day, the longer and hillier course favoured the horses, with 2011 winner Beti Gordon comfortably beating the first man, Hugh Aggleton.

The 2013 race attracted an entry of 65 horses, with 44 completing the course, enabling it to lay claim to being &quot;the world&#x27;s largest horse race&quot;. Following a number of criticisms of the extended course in 2013 and 2014, the course for 2015 was shortened back towards 21 miles. This provided a more even match between man and equine, with Geoffrey Allen on Leo emerging victorious by just over 10 minutes from Hugh Aggleton. It was Allen&#x27;s 4th outright win, and his 5th time as first horseman, having been beaten by Florian Holzinger in 2007.

==Winners==
Note that the times are not necessarily comparable from year to year due to changes of the rules and the course layout.

<doc id="719317" wikidata="Q224367" url="?curid=719317" title="The Beach Boys Today!">
<text>The Beach Boys Today! is the eighth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released March 8, 1965, by Capitol Records. It signaled a departure from their previous records with its orchestral sound, intimate subject matter, and abandonment of car or surf songs. Side one features an uptempo sound, while side two consists mostly of introspective ballads. Supported by this thematic approach, the record established the group as album artists rather than just a singles band.

The album was produced, arranged, and largely written by Brian Wilson with additional lyrics by Mike Love. Most of it was recorded in January 1965 with the aid of over 25 studio musicians shortly after Wilson had suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring with his bandmates. Building on the advancements of &quot;All Summer Long&quot; (1964), &quot;Today!&quot; showcased more refined performances, denser and richer arrangements, slower tempos, longer structures, and influences drawn from Phil Spector and Burt Bacharach.

Unlike their prior albums, none of the songs employ just traditional rock instrumentation as accompaniment. Instead, a more eclectic selection of instruments, including timpani, harpsichord, vibraphone, and French horn, feature throughout the album. Lyrically, Wilson developed a more personalized, semi-autobiographical approach, with his songs written from the perspective of vulnerable, neurotic, and insecure narrators. The LP includes &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;, about a man who acknowledges his cruel treatment of his girlfriend, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;, about a sibling who appears to conflate fraternal and romantic feelings for his younger sister, and &quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot;, a ballad that ends with a breakdown of instruments playing asynchronously.

&quot;Today!&quot; reached number four in the U.S. during a 50-week chart stay and yielded three top 20 singles: &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; (number 9), &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; (number 8), and &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; (number 12). A rerecorded version of &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;, issued in April, became the band&#x27;s second number-one hit in the US. In the UK, the album was released in April 1966 and peaked at number 6. &quot;Today!&quot; continues to attract critical acclaim, with commentators usually focusing on the second side of the record, often describing it as a precursor to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). 

==Background==

Following the success of their chart-topping &quot;I Get Around&quot; single, the Beach Boys&#x27; touring schedule became considerably more busy. From June to August, the group toured in support of their newest LP, &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, which had marked the most complex arrangements on a Beach Boys record to date, as well as being the first that was not focused on themes of cars or surfing. They also readied a Christmas album for release in November. By the end of the year, they had released four albums in 12 months and additionally recorded the singles &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; and &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;. In November, they toured the UK and mainland Europe for the first time, appearing on various television programs and playing shows.

By this point, principal songwriter Brian Wilson had become overwhelmed by the increasing pressures of his career and personal life. He later explained, &quot;I used to be Mr Everything ... I was run down mentally and emotionally because I was running around, jumping on jets from one city to another on one-night stands, also producing, writing, arranging, singing, planning, teaching – to the point where I had no peace of mind and no chance to actually sit down and think or even rest.&quot; Adding to his concerns was the group&#x27;s &quot;business operations&quot; and the quality of their records, which he believed suffered from this arrangement. During the European tour, frontman and lyricist Mike Love told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that he and the band wished to move on from surf music and avoid resting on the band&#x27;s laurels.

Wilson was also wracked with anxiety over his relationship with 16-year-old singer Marilyn Rovell. During the group&#x27;s tour of Europe, he began consuming alcohol more frequently than he ever had, and channeled his feelings into writing songs. On December 7, in an effort to bring himself more emotional stability, he impulsively married Rovell. Around this time, he was introduced to marijuana by a new acquaintance from the music industry, Loren Schwartz. Wilson&#x27;s habitual use of the drug exacerbated tensions in his marriage.

On December 23, Wilson was to accompany his bandmates on a two-week U.S. tour, but while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, began sobbing uncontrollably over his marriage and suffered a nervous breakdown. Al Jardine, who had sat next to Wilson on the plane, later said, &quot;None of us had ever witnessed something like that.&quot; Brian played the show in Houston later that day, but was substituted by session musician Glen Campbell for the rest of the tour dates. This was the first time Wilson had skipped concert dates with the Beach Boys since 1963.

Over the next month, the group returned to studio sessions and finished the tracks that formed &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; Wilson ultimately declared to his bandmates that he would be withdrawing from future tours for an indefinite period of time. He said, &quot;I told them I foresee a beautiful future for the Beach Boys group, but the only way we could achieve it was if they did their job and I did mine.&quot; According to Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Wilson had been considering retiring from the music industry, but changed his mind upon hearing their recent song &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; (produced and co-written by Phil Spector). Wilson later told a journalist that his decision to quit touring was a byproduct of his &quot;fucked up&quot; jealousy over Spector and the Beatles. Journalist Nick Kent wrote that Wilson had also been &quot;listening intently&quot; to the work of Burt Bacharach and Hal David.

==Style==
===Orchestrations and concept===

&quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; marked a stylistic departure from previous Beach Boys LPs and was their most musically sophisticated to date, featuring more complex and innovative arrangements. Academic Jadey O&#x27;Regan identified the album as the start of a period in which the band focused predominately on &quot;unexpected structures and chordal movements, dense vocal harmonies, and a wide variety of orchestral textures not often heard in popular music of the time.&quot; However, musicologist Phillip Lambert disagreed with the notion that &quot;Brian wrote B-side songs before his December catharsis and A-side songs in the sunny glow of his subsequent freedom&quot;, believing that the compositions which preceded his plane episode still showed evidence of progressive ingenuity.

&quot;Today!&quot; was arranged as a concept album, with the first side of the record consisting of uptempo songs and the other side consisting of ballads. As music historian James Perone writes, &quot;it was organized in such a way as to explore moods that extended from song to song. In other words, more than anything else Wilson had produced before, it was a coherent work and not just a collection of stand-alone songs.&quot; However, the thematic consistency is undercut by the presence of a filler track, &quot;Bull Session with the &quot;Big Daddy&quot;&quot;, placed at the very end of the album.

Many of Wilson&#x27;s new songs were written under the influence of marijuana. His 2016 memoir, &quot;I Am Brian Wilson&quot;, suggested, &quot;smoking a little bit of pot ... changed the way I heard arrangements.&quot; Further on the subject of his marijuana use, he commented in an interview, &quot;It opened some doors for me, and I got a little more committed to music than I had done before, more committed to the making of music for people on a spiritual level.&quot; Journalist David Howard argued that Wilson&#x27;s use of marijuana had an &quot;immediate effect&quot; on his writing and production style, influencing the slower tempos, &quot;more expansive&quot; arrangements, introspective lyrics, as well as his &quot;thinking in regard to the recording process ... his productions became denser and richer.&quot;

Unlike their prior records, none of the songs feature just basic rock instrumentation as accompaniment (drums, bass, guitar, piano, organ, vocals). Seven of the eleven songs feature orchestral-style instrumentation, while the remaining four use basic rock set-ups as a foundation, being augmented with other instruments that the band members themselves could not play. This included the accordion, autoharp, English horn, oboe, electric mandolin, and French horn. Also featured are a range of percussion instruments, from sleigh bells and timbales to triangles.

Owing to the greater number of ballads, Wilson invokes his signature falsetto nine times on the record, the most he had on a Beach Boys album since 1963&#x27;s &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;. Unusually, Dennis Wilson sang lead on the first and last songs on the album (&quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; and &quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot;). This was because Brian had felt that Dennis &quot;never really had a chance to sing very much&quot;, and so he gave him more leads on the album.

===Themes and musical structures===
Lyrically, Wilson developed a more personalized, semi-autobiographical approach, with his songs written from the perspective of vulnerable, neurotic, and insecure narrators. All of the songs are expressed from a first-person perspective, and none of them involve themes related to cars or surfing. Instead, they offer a matured take on romantic relationships, as well as being more introspective, relating to such themes as growing up. Music historian Charles Granata said that the songs &quot;exhibit a unified lyrical theme: the wonder of adolescent love and the expression of tender, pleading affection&quot;, subject matter that was &quot;far more&quot; substantial than when the group &quot;declare[d] their love for a girl, car, or the surf.&quot;

Virtually every song expresses anticipation or apprehensiveness about the future, and the album is consistent with the Beach Boys&#x27; past records by remaining largely concerned with teenage experiences. Journalist Alice Bolin wrote, &quot;This makes some sense – Wilson was barely out of high school when the Beach Boys formed – but on &quot;Today!&quot;, the childlike lyrics take a turn for the unsettling&quot;, particularly when scrutinized against Wilson&#x27;s 22-year-old perspective, as Bolin felt, &quot;Wilson&#x27;s attraction to teenage girls and his prolonged interest in teenage life smacks of a kind of arrested development.&quot; In the book &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop&quot;, Bob Stanley remarked of the lyrics, &quot;Brian was aiming for Johnny Mercer but coming up proto-indie.&quot;

&quot;Today!&quot; contained more songs with a verse-chorus structure than any prior Beach Boys album. Jazz chord types and relations appear in many songs, including &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot;, and &quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot;. O&#x27;Regan uses the aforementioned songs as examples of &quot;a maturing view of life and relationships that were underpinned by and reflected in the expandable and flexible verse-chorus form.&quot; He wrote that &quot;Today!&quot; offered the &quot;clearest example&quot; of the group&#x27;s pre-1967 &quot;lyrical experimentation&quot; due to the &quot;longer and more flexible structures&quot;.

Side two marks the introduction of major seventh and major ninth chords, which, O&#x27;Regan states, &quot;soften the lively sound of the A side&quot;. Journalist Scott Interrante noted that &quot;it would be a mistake to assume that the ballads are more sophisticated. ... Wilson proves that he can be just as harmonically and structurally inventive with catchy dance songs as he can with emotional ballads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/Intro&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, &quot;Even in the upbeat songs like &#x27;Do You Wanna Dance?&#x27; and &#x27;Dance, Dance, Dance&#x27;, there is a sense of focus on the future, and a distinct, unsettling feeling that they’re trying to dance off.&quot; He further characterized A-side songs such as &quot;Good to My Baby&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; with having a &quot;deceptive simplicity&quot; in their music and lyrics.

==Recording==

&quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; was largely recorded between January 7 and 19, 1965, at Western Studio in Hollywood. Other studios used were Gold Star (&quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;) and RCA Victor (&quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;). Four songs were recorded in the previous year: &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; (June), &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; (August), &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; (October), and the backing track for &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot; (December 16).

Wilson had been employing the services of Phil Spector&#x27;s session musicians (later known as &quot;the Wrecking Crew&quot;) since the &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; sessions. He used them to a greater degree on &quot;Today!&quot;, with the number of studio musicians used for each track usually exceeding 11 players, while performance takes ran to the 30s. Dillon writes that the further takes &quot;showed his studio skills were sharper than ever and [that he] was increasingly demanding of both the session musicians and the group.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s 2016 memoir states that, following the airplane episode, he had endeavored to &quot;take the things I learned from Phil Spector and use more instruments whenever I could. I doubled up on basses and tripled up on keyboards, which made everything sound bigger and deeper.&quot;

The recording process typically involved recording an instrumental on two tracks of 3-track tape with one remaining track left for the first vocal overdub. This tape was then dubbed down to a second tape for an additional layer of vocal overdubs. &quot;Today!&quot; was ultimately mixed down to mono and was their first album not to be issued in stereo since &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; (1963). Select tracks from the album were later remixed for stereo on Beach Boys compilation albums. A complete stereo mix of &quot;Today!&quot; was first released in 2012.

==Contents==
===Side one===
====&quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;====

&quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; is a cover of the R&amp;B song by Bobby Freeman, who had a top 10 hit with it in 1958. It is distinguished from the original through its lush orchestration, three-part vocal arrangement, and instrumental bridge key change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/DYWD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon speculated that the rendition may have been inspired by the version by Del Shannon, who had recently recorded the song, although the Beach Boys&#x27; version bears a &quot;closer resemblance&quot; to an earlier version by Cliff Richard and the Shadows. It was the first song the group recorded at Gold Star, Spector&#x27;s favorite studio, and their second song that employed a timpani.

====&quot;Good to My Baby&quot;====
&quot;Good to My Baby&quot; is about a man responding to criticisms regarding the way he treats his girlfriend. Interrante opined that while it is not &quot;musically exciting or complex&quot;, the defensive and anxious tone &quot;running throughout the song adds a dark quality that’s not immediately on the surface, and ultimately makes &#x27;Good to My Baby&#x27; all the more interesting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/GTMB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; O&#x27;Regan highlights the use of a major supertonic function (II) with giving &quot;the [chord] progression a surprising lift under the positivity of the lyrics – it reaffirms the confidence the singer feels about his relationship, despite what others may think.&quot;

====&quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;====
&quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; is about a sibling who appears to conflate fraternal and romantic feelings for his younger sister. The lyrical inspiration is often attributed to Wilson&#x27;s conflicted infatuations toward Marilyn and her sisters Diane and Barbara. According to Wilson&#x27;s 2016 memoir, it was written &quot;about me and the Rovells. I wrote it from the perspective of one of them telling me not to treat another one of them badly.&quot; Carlin wrote that the subject matter &quot;recounts Diane Rovell&#x27;s pointed advice from the early (and surreptitious) days of Brian and Marilyn&#x27;s affair, only with an uncomfortable fraternal ardor: ″&quot;Why don’t you love her like her big brother?&quot;″&quot;

Wilson wrote the song for the Ronettes, modelling the chords and melodies after Spector&#x27;s songs, and submitted it to Spector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/DHMLS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the song, but rewrote the lyrics, renamed it &quot;Things Are Changing (For the Better)&quot;, and recorded it with the Blossoms. Wilson was to play piano on the recording session before being dismissed by Spector due to a substandard performance. Wilson later recycled the chord progression of the song&#x27;s refrain for the band&#x27;s &quot;California Girls&quot; (1965).

====&quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot;====
&quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; is about a boy who is anxious of when he stops being a teenager. At the time, Brian told the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, &quot;When I was younger, I used to worry about turning into an old square over the years. I don&#x27;t think I will now, and that is what inspired &#x27;When I Grow Up&#x27;.&quot; In a 2011 interview, he commented that when he wrote the song, he had a dismal view of his future. In his 2016 memoir, Love wrote that the song was &quot;probably influenced&quot; by Murry Wilson, who constantly challenged Brian&#x27;s manhood.

In the lyrics, the narrator poses such question as &quot;Will I love my wife for the rest of my life?&quot; That line in particular marked the first instance of a Beach Boys song discussing falling out of love with someone, as opposed to just being in or out of a relationship. Critic Richard Meltzer later cited &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; as the moment when the Beach Boys &quot;abruptly ceased to be boys&quot;. It is one of the first rock songs to discuss impending adulthood and is possibly the earliest U.S. top 40 song to contain the expression &quot;turn on&quot; (from the lyric &quot;will I still like the things that turned me on as a kid?&quot;).

Granata wrote that the song &quot;best exemplifies the [band&#x27;s] musical growth&quot; through its &quot;effective combination of odd sounds&quot; and its &quot;full and round&quot; vocal harmonies. With the exception of the harmonica in the verses, all the instruments were played by the group members themselves. It took 37 takes to record. O&#x27;Regan afforded attention to the drum pattern for avoiding a traditional backbeat rhythm. Instead, it &quot;effectively plays &#x27;around&#x27; the vocals with interesting fills adding texture and drama to the passing of time in the lyrics. Each part of the drum kit works independently from each other, horizontally as four separate parts, rather than a whole set working together.&quot;

====&quot;Help Me, &quot;====
&quot;Help Me,&quot; is about someone whose fiance left him for another man and subsequently begs for a woman named Ronda to &quot;help me get her out of my heart&quot; with a one-night stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/HMR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was sung by Al Jardine, his second ever lead vocal for the group. Wilson and Love denied speculation that the &quot;Ronda&quot; mentioned in the lyric was based on a real-life person, although Love said that the opening lines drew from his high school experiences.

Wilson said that he came up with the song while &quot;fooling around on the piano&quot; playing Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; with its &quot;cool, shuffle beat&quot;. O&#x27;Regan felt that &quot;the uneven rhythm&quot; represented &quot;both the limping pain from the previous relationship, and the heart-skipping feeling of new love.&quot; The song ends with a series of fake fade-outs, described by journalist Alexis Petridis as &quot;undercutting the triumphant chorus with a weird sense of uncertainty.&quot;

====&quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;====
&quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, written in a similar vein as &quot;I Get Around&quot;, is about escaping emotional stress through music and dancing. It is their first song with a writing credit to Carl Wilson, who devised the guitar riff. Interrante praised the band&#x27;s performance on the track: &quot;Despite being joined by some studio players, it&#x27;s Carl’s 12-string playing, especially his solo, and Dennis Wilson&#x27;s ecstatic drumming that are the real driving forces behind the song.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/DDD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version of the song, recorded in Nashville in September 1964, was included as a bonus track on the album&#x27;s 1990 reissue.

===Side two===
====&quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot;====
&quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot; was the first song Wilson wrote under the influence of marijuana. It is about a man who is afraid that a woman will reveal that she does not love him, and so he instead prefers to fantasize that she does. Wilson said that he did the song &quot;as a tribute to Phil Spector&quot;, although the arrangement, which highlights different, individual instruments throughout the song, was in direct contrast to the methods employed by Spector for his Wall of Sound.

The instrumentation includes drums, timpani, tambourine, bass, two guitars, acoustic guitar, piano, tack piano, organ, horns, and vibraphone. In Howard&#x27;s description, the song &quot;specifically demonstrates&quot; Wilson&#x27;s &quot;newfound insight&quot; of &quot;deconstruct[ing] songs into tiny increments and deal with each instrument individually, stacking sounds one at a time.&quot;

====&quot;I&#x27;m So Young&quot;====
&quot;I&#x27;m So Young&quot; is a rendition of the 1958 doo-wop hit originally performed by the Students. Wilson chose to record the song because another version by the Ronettes&#x27; Veronica Bennett had recently been issued as a single. In contrast to the album&#x27;s other cover song, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; approach to &quot;I&#x27;m So Young&quot; deviated minimally from the original. Interrante pointed to the outro (a feature that Wilson invented for his version) as the arrangement&#x27;s most &quot;innovative&quot; quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/ISY&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier version of the band&#x27;s recording, containing a flute and a more prominent bassline, was released on the album&#x27;s 1990 reissue. Wilson soon revisited the song&#x27;s &quot;too young to get married&quot; lyrical theme for the group&#x27;s &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; (1966).

====&quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot;====
&quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot; is about a quarrel between the narrator and his lover, and his attempt to repair their relationship. Wilson was inspired to write &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot; while walking around a red light district in Copenhagen days after proposing to his soon-to-be wife. Love said that the &quot;wistful bass line ... led to my lyrics about a guy who has a disagreement with his girlfriend, even though they can&#x27;t even remember what they fought about, leaving them both brokenhearted.&quot; Dillon cited it as &quot;a ballad that pleaded for the romantic reconciliation [Wilson] anticipated with Marilyn.&quot; Conversely, Interrante said that the track is different from the album&#x27;s other songs in that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to lyrically parallel Brian Wilson’s personal life at the time&quot; and focuses &quot;on coming to terms with the present&quot; rather than anticipating the future.

The arrangement features basses, guitars, saxophone, pianos, vibraphone, drums, and temple blocks—the sound of the latter percussion soon became a signature for Wilson– as well as English horn and French horn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/KMB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Doo-wop style background vocals sing &quot;Kiss a little bit, fight a little bit&quot; repetitively throughout the chorus and outro. Interrante described the song as among Wilson&#x27;s &quot;most interesting compositions&quot; in addition to containing &quot;some of the thickest and most beautiful harmonies the group had pulled off up to that point.&quot; Biographer Jon Stebbins praised &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot; as &quot;the pinnacle of balladry&quot;, one of the group&#x27;s &quot;most romantic and emotional songs&quot;, and &quot;a mammoth artistic achievement&quot;. A vocals-only mix was included on the 2003 compilation &quot;Hawthorne, CA&quot;.

====&quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;====
&quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot; showcases a narrator who is critical of how he treats his girlfriend and admits to having jealousy and double standards in the relationship. However, he convinces himself that his emotional abuse is fine, since it is mitigated by the fact that &quot;she can tell I really love her&quot;. Wilson considered the song to be an homage to Burt Bacharach.

It was the first track attempted for the album, although the original recorded version, made in June 1964, was scrapped in favor of a remake that was cut in August, during the same session for &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;. The high-pitched percussion sound was made by hitting a screwdriver on a microphone boom pole.

====&quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot;====
&quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot; is about someone who describes themselves as &quot;blessed with everything&quot;, yet has unfounded suspicions that his happy relationship will someday disintegrate. It features a dissonant orchestration and instruments such as saxophone, strings, and oboe. Dennis Wilson sang the lead without the accompaniment of any vocal harmonies. It is one of the group&#x27;s songs that most heavily draw from the Tin Pan Alley style of songwriting, and in Lambert&#x27;s assessment, the chord patterns &quot;are virtually unprecedented in Brian&#x27;s work.&quot; It ends with a breakdown of its instruments playing asynchronously.

It is regarded among fans and critics as one of the band&#x27;s &quot;masterpieces&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott/INBOMM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Doggett said of Dennis&#x27; performance, &quot;he showed for the first time an awareness that his voice could be a blunt emotional instrument. ... his erratic croon cut straight to the heart, with an urgency that his more precise brothers could never have matched.&quot; Granata described the track as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;the antithesis of any prescribed commercial formula—a curious experiment marking an extreme deviation from the band.&quot; Howard similarly regarded its &quot;stony lead vocal&quot; and &quot;warped string arrangement&quot; as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious arrangement to date.&quot; A 1975 recording of Brian performing the song on piano was released as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of his 2015 solo album &quot;No Pier Pressure&quot;.

====&quot;Bull Session with the &#x27;Big Daddy″&quot;====
&quot;Bull Session with the &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;&quot; ends the album with a spoof interview of the band, conducted by journalist Earl Leaf, in which they discuss the group&#x27;s recent tour of Europe. The track is a 2-minute edit of a recording that originally ran for over 20 minutes. At one point, Brian remarks, &quot;Well, I haven&#x27;t made a mistake yet in my whole career&quot;, to which Love adds, &quot;Brian, we keep waiting for you to make a mistake.&quot;

===Leftover songs===

&quot;All Dressed Up for School&quot; was a leftover track recorded by the band on September 14, 1964. The song was originally written by Wilson and Love for the singer Sharon Marie, as &quot;What&#x27;ll I Wear to School Today&quot;. Lambert described &quot;All Dressed Up For School&quot; as &quot;packed with musical invention&quot; and said that the lyrics are &quot;interesting&quot; despite being &quot;unsuitable for release in 1964.&quot; In 1990, it was released as a bonus track on a reissue of &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; and &quot;All Summer Long&quot;.

&quot;Guess I&#x27;m Dumb&quot;, written by Wilson and producer Russ Titelman, was tracked on October 14, 1964. Wilson&#x27;s 2016 memoir states: &quot;When I was finished, no one from the band wanted to sing it. The message was okay, but maybe it was just the idea of being dumb.&quot; In March 1965, Wilson gave the song to Glen Campbell as a show of thanks for his services with the touring group. It became Campbell&#x27;s tenth single on Capitol, issued on June 7. Howard said it was Wilson&#x27;s &quot;most inspired&quot; production to date, featuring a &quot;surging, elegant Burt Bacharach-inspired string and horn arrangement and Campbell&#x27;s forlorn Roy Orbison-like vocal.&quot; 

==Release and initial reception==
Three tracks from the album were issued on two singles in the months prior the LP&#x27;s release. &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot; (B-side &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;) was issued on August 24 and peaked at number 9 in the U.S. and number 27 in the UK. On October 26, it was followed with &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, reaching number 8 in the U.S. and number 24 in the UK. On November 28, the band were filmed for the concert film &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, playing &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; and other hits.

From January 27 to February 27, 1965, the band toured North America, with Campbell again substituting for Wilson. On February 15, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; (B-side &quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot;), was issued as the third single, peaking at number 12 in the US. On February 28, the band (with Brian) appeared on &quot;Shindig!&quot; performing &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; and a truncated version of &quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot;.

Released on March 8, &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; was a great commercial success, rising to number four in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on May 1. In April, a rerecorded version of &quot;Help Me, Ronda&quot; (retitled &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;) was issued as a single, becoming the group&#x27;s second number-one hit in the US. This version of the song was included on the band&#x27;s next LP, &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;, released in July. On October 1, the RIAA awarded &quot;Today!&quot; gold certification, indicating over 500,000 units sold.

The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; called the album &quot;entertaining but a disappointment in relation to past efforts&quot;, and panned the inclusion of &quot;Bull Session with the &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Anaheim Bulletin&quot;, however, admired the LP&#x27;s final track, deeming it &quot;a talkie, natural, behind-the-scenes-type informal gab session.&quot;

In the UK, &quot;Today!&quot; was released in April 1966 and peaked at number 6. Reviewing the album for &quot;London Life&quot;, Barry Fantoni described the &quot;marvellous&quot; production and numerous &quot;really beautiful tunes&quot; as displaying the Beach Boys at their peak. The &quot;Record Mirror&quot; review rued, &quot;Must garner sales, even if it doesn&#x27;t really extend the Beach Boy talents particularly&quot;.

==Retrospective assessments==
&quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot; has attracted much acclaim, although most of the critical attention has been reserved for the second side of the record. Writing in the book &quot;Icons of Rock&quot;, Scott Schinder highlighted the ballad side as &quot;startling, both in their lyrical vulnerability and their distinctive arrangements.&quot; Petridis opined that the &quot;overlooked first half is equally fascinating&quot; for its emotional content, noting that &quot;even the filler of &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; carries a slightly dark undercurrent.&quot;

On the band&#x27;s subsequent releases, Wilson&#x27;s writing and production style continued to grow in its sophistication, to the extent that writers often refer to the second side of the record as a precursor to the 1966 album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Bolin called &quot;Today!&quot; &quot;an important artifact, with its sound forming a link between the Beach Boys&#x27; doo-wop-influenced beginnings and the lush and orchestral &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Interrante wrote that it was &quot;an exciting album&quot; that showed early signs of Wilson &quot;blur[ring] the lines between ballad and uptempo songs&quot;, and that in contrast to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;&quot;Today!&quot; is about the optimism, not the sadness, of leaving adolescence.&quot;

Less favorably, biographer Steven Gaines criticized &quot;Today!&quot; as &quot;not one of Brian&#x27;s best works, consisting mostly of a melange of uninspired car tunes ...&quot; Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger declared that it was &quot;strong almost from start to finish.&quot; Similarly, Schinder wrote that it &quot;would have been the first Beach Boys LP to be sublime from beginning to end, were it not for the closing track&quot;. Interrante said of &quot;Bull Session with the &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27;&quot;, &quot;one seriously questions why it was included at all. ... I think we can all agree that the album would be better off without it.&quot; Bolin decreed that &quot;it can be hard to separate &quot;Today!&quot; from the masterpiece it led to – so much so that &quot;Today!&quot; can feel like a rehearsal for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, with its themes and ideas repeated and perfected in the later album.&quot; However, she also states that &quot;to hear it only in relation to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; would be to undermine what a strange and original work &quot;Today!&quot; really is.&quot;

&quot;Today!&quot; regularly appears on &quot;top album lists&quot; conducted by publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2005, it was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included it among &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2012, it was ranked number 271 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, with the entry stating, &quot;Brian Wilson was already a genius. He writes sweet California tunes here, and the haunting &#x27;She Knows Me Too Well&#x27; hits &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;-deep.&quot; On the list&#x27;s 2020 edition, the record&#x27;s position descended to number 466.

==Impact and legacy==
With &quot;Today!&quot;, the Beach Boys established themselves as album artists rather than just a singles band. Schinder credited its &quot;suite-like structure&quot; with presenting &quot;an early manifestation of the rock album format being used to make a cohesive artistic statement – an idea that Brian would soon explore more fully.&quot; Bolin similarly recognized it as the band&#x27;s &quot;first flirtation with the album-as-art form. Journalist Paul Lester writes that the album &quot;set new standards for rock&quot;, while Interrante echoes that its &quot;intricate and sophisticated music ... brought the group, and pop music in general to a new place.&quot;

Record producer Phil Ramone states that, while some of the album&#x27;s more unusual instrumental groupings might have been explored by jazz musicians like Claude Thornhill and Gil Evans, Wilson was pioneering in incorporating these unique combinations of instruments into the realm of mainstream pop music. In his book &quot;1965: The Most Revolutionary Year in Music&quot; (2015), Andrew Grant credits &quot;Today!&quot; with inaugurating &quot;the era of baroque pop, a.k.a. chamber pop, in which bands fused elements of classical with rock&quot;. In Perone&#x27;s belief, &quot;Today!&quot; began the reciprocal chain of influence between the Beatles and the Beach Boys, inspiring &quot;at least&quot; part of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; (1965).

==Reissues and compilations==
* In 1990, &quot;Today!&quot; was packaged with &quot;Summer Days&quot; for a CD reissue that included alternate takes of &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Young&quot; as bonus tracks.
* In 2012, Capitol issued a remastered mono and stereo edition of the album.
* In 2014, Capitol released &quot;Keep an Eye on Summer – The Beach Boys Sessions 1964&quot;, a rarities compilation that included alternate versions of &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;, &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Young&quot;, &quot;All Dressed Up for School&quot;, and &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;.

==Track listing==
Lead vocals per Craig Slowinski.

Note
* &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot; and &quot;Please Let Me Wonder&quot; were originally the only tracks on the album that listed a writing credit to Mike Love. Following his 1994 lawsuit, &quot;Love v. Wilson&quot;, he was awarded co-writing credits to seven more songs: &quot;Good to My Baby&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot;, &quot;When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)&quot;, &quot;Help Me, Ronda&quot;, &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot;, and &quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot;.

<text>The term elite media refers to newspapers, radio stations, TV channels, and other media that are deemed to serve a political or economic elite and influence the political agenda of other mass media. According to Noam Chomsky’s Propaganda Model, &quot;[t]he elite media set a framework within which others operate”.

The term can have different meanings depending on political ideology e.g.&quot;The New York Times&quot; is used as an example of elite media in the context of a criticism of class society and corporate hierarchy by Chomsky, an anarchist intellectual, while conservative Bill O&#x27;Reilly, uses the term to identify liberals with elites while associating the right, including wealthy businessmen, with the interests of common people. 

Conservatives often use &quot;Elite media&quot; or &quot;Media elite&quot; in a pejorative context, alleging that the reporting is biased and untrustworthy—-associating liberalism with elites who, unlike conservatives, have disdain for working-class needs and values.

<text>ǃOrakobab or Khoemana, also known as Korana, ǃOra, or Griqua, is a moribund Khoe language of South Africa.

==Names==
&quot;Khoemana&quot; (from &quot;khoe&quot; &#x27;person&#x27; + &quot;mana&quot; &#x27;language&#x27;) is more commonly known as either Korana (also ǃOrakobab, ǃOra, Kora, Koraqua) or Griqua (also Gri , Xri, Xiri, Xirikwa). The name &#x27;Korana&#x27; reflects the endonym ǃOra or ǃGora , referring to the ǃOra people. Sometimes ǃOra is also known as Cape Khoe or Cape Hottentot, though the latter has become considered derogatory. The various names are often treated as different languages (called South Khoekhoe when taken together), but they do not correspond to any actual dialect distinctions, and speakers may use &quot;Korana&quot; and &quot;Griqua&quot; interchangeably. Both names are also used more broadly, for example for the Griqua people. There exist (or existed) several dialects of Khoemana, but the details are unknown.

==Phonology==
Khoemana is closely related to Khoekhoe, and the sound systems are broadly similar. The strongly aspirated Khoekhoe affricates are simply aspirated plosives in Khoemana. However, Khoemana has an ejective velar affricate, , which is not found in Khoekhoe, and a corresponding series of clicks, . Beach (1938) reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had a velar lateral ejective affricate, , a common realisation or allophone of in languages with clicks, and it might be expected that this is true for Khoemana as well. In addition, about half of all lexical words in Khoemana began with a click, compared to a quarter in Khoekhoe.

In Korana, [oe] and [oa] can be pronounced as [we] and [wa].

* The phoneme [k] can be realized as /c/ before [e] or [i].
* An intervocalic [p] and [b] are sometimes realized as /β/.
* [s] is stated to be alveolar-postalveolar when not followed by a close front vowel [i], [ĩ], or [e].
* The aspirated phoneme [tʰ] is realized as an affricate sound /ts/ when followed by a close front vowel [i], [ĩ], or [e].
* The aspirated sound [kʰ] can sometimes be realized as [kx]. Some Griqua speakers may pronounce [kʰ] as [kʼ].
* The [tsʼ] sound only seldom occurs.
* [m] and [n] can occur syllabically as [m̩] and [n̩].
* The trilled [r] can also be realized as a flapped [ɾ] in some speech.
* Voicing can be very weak in Khoemana in casual speech, so voiced plosives can be hard to distinguish from voiceless plosives.

There are four tones in Khoemana: high (notated with an acute accent), rising (notated with a caron), mid (no accent), and falling (notated with a circumflex).

==Population==
Reports as to the number of Khoemana speakers are contradictory, but it is clear that it is nearly extinct. It was thought to be extinct until the discovery of four elderly speakers around Bloemfontein and Kimberley. A 2009 report by Don Killian of the University of Helsinki estimated that there were less than 30 speakers at the time. Matthias Brenzinger reported in 2012 that one possible speaker remained, but that she refused to speak the language. The discrepancies could be because the language has multiple dialects and goes by several names, with scholars not always referring to the same population. Khoemana is listed as &quot;critically endangered&quot; in UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Language Atlas&quot;. The loss of this endangered language would have a significant impact on the heritage and culture of Khoemana speakers.

==Attestation==
Robust Khoemana (before more recent language attrition) is principally recorded in an 1879 notebook by Lucy Lloyd, which contains five short stories; some additional work was done in Ponelis (1975). As of 2009, the EuroBABEL project is searching for remaining speakers.

==History==

The people and their language first began to attract scholarly attention in the 1660s, coinciding with Dutch colonial efforts in the Cape of Good Hope and the resulting armed conflicts. At the time, Khoemana was widely spoken throughout the coastal regions of South Africa. After years of attrition during the colonial era to the 1930s, and under apartheid from 1948 to 1994, the language has all but vanished. Currently, speakers of Khoemana are not only scarce but scattered, due to forced migrations during the apartheid era. This has rendered the language particularly vulnerable.

<text>Making History (1996) is the third novel by Stephen Fry. Its plot involves the creation of an alternative historical timeline in which Adolf Hitler never existed. While most of the book is written in standard prose, a couple of chapters are written in the format of a screenplay. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History.

==Plot==

===Changing history===
The story is told in first person by Michael &quot;Puppy&quot; Young, a young history student at Cambridge University on the verge of completing his doctoral thesis on the early life of Adolf Hitler and his mother. He meets Professor Leo Zuckerman, a physicist who has a strong personal interest in Hitler, the rise of Nazism and the Holocaust. Michael assumes this is due to his Jewish heritage. However, it is later revealed that Leo was born Axil Bauer, the son of Dietrich Bauer, a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz who – when the Nazi defeat became certain – gave his son the identity of a Jewish doctor that he murdered. Leo has developed a machine that enables the past to be viewed—but it is of no practical use as the image is not resolvable into details. Together, they hatch a plan to modify the machine such that it can be used to send something back in time. They decide to use a permanent male contraceptive pill, stolen from Michael&#x27;s girlfriend (a biochemistry researcher), who, due to his continual distraction, has left him to take a position at Princeton University. They decide to send the pill back in time to the well in Braunau am Inn so that Hitler&#x27;s father will drink from it and become infertile, with the result that Hitler will never be born.

===Consequences===
When Michael awakens he is completely disoriented. He soon discovers that he is in the United States, at Princeton University. Everyone he encounters is surprised that he is speaking with an English accent. It takes some time for Michael&#x27;s memory to return. He realises that his plan was successful, history has changed, and for some reason his parents must have moved to America. Initially he is elated and tells his new friend Steve how happy he is because Steve has never heard of Hitler, Braunau am Inn, or the Nazi Party. Steve corrects Michael and reveals that, while never hearing of Hitler, he is all too aware of the Nazi Party.

Michael begins to discover the history of this new world. It turns out that without Hitler, a new leader emerged, Rudolf Gloder, who was equally ruthless. In fact, Michael and Zuckerman have replaced Hitler with a Nazi leader who was even more charming, patient, and effective, and as committed to the Final Solution as Hitler had been.

In this alternative timeline, the Nazis won a mandate in the Reichstag in 1932 and built up an electronics industry of their own. Unlike Hitler, Gloder proceeded with stealth, ensuring peaceful unification with Austria in 1937. More alarmingly, Gloder&#x27;s Nazis also had a head start on the research and development of nuclear weapons, which led to the destruction of Moscow and Leningrad, eliminating Joseph Stalin and his Politburo in this alternative 1938. The Greater German Reich annexes Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Turkey, and invades the remnants of the former Soviet Union. In 1939, France, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations capitulate, although Britain rebels in 1941, leading to the execution of several dissidents, among them the Duke of York (the historical King George VI) and George Orwell. Jews are exiled to a &quot;Jewish Free State&quot; within the former Yugoslavia, where most of this world&#x27;s Holocaust occurs. The United States develops nuclear weapons in 1941, leading to a Cold War between Nazi Europe and the United States. The latter has never gone to war against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific.

As a result, this United States has become far more socially conservative. Because there was no sixties upsurge of social liberalism and decriminalisation of homosexuality in (Nazi-occupied) Western Europe in this world, in the US the latter is still a felony and racial segregation is still active. Students at Princeton are purely white and the only Black people on campus are manual workers; students feel free to harass them and use slurs.

Steve turns out to be homosexual and in love with Michael, and when he discovers Michael&#x27;s background, he marvels at his talk of gay pride marches, urban gay communities, and a mass social movement in Michael&#x27;s world of origin, regarding it as &quot;utopian&quot;. Much to his own surprise, Michael reciprocates Steve&#x27;s feelings.

Michael is apprehended by the authorities, who believe that he is a possible spy—since Britain had been under Nazi rule for nearly half a century, anyone speaking like a Briton is a suspect. Michael learns that the water from the well in Hitler&#x27;s home town was used to create &quot;Braunau Water&quot;, which was the instrument to sterilise the European Jews, wiping them out in one generation. In a cruel twist of fate, the person who perfected the synthesis was Dietrich Bauer. Once more his physicist son, Axel, is wracked with guilt and has developed a Temporal Imager. With Michael and Steve&#x27;s help, they plan to send a dead rat to poison the well so that it will be pumped clean of the sterilising water. As they begin to do this, they are interrupted by the federal agents who apprehended Michael earlier and they end up shooting Steve, who dies in Michael&#x27;s arms just as the time alteration occurs.

===Changing history again===
Time changes again. Expecting the disorientation, Michael comes to his senses faster now and discovers that almost everything is back to how it was, except that his favourite band, Oily-Moily, never existed (one of the band&#x27;s members was of Austrian extraction). He gives up his career in academia, figuring he can at least make some money &quot;writing&quot; the songs that he remembers from the previous reality. Finally, Michael is reunited with Steve, who is English in this universe and also remembers the previous reality. Their gay relationship is no longer criminal.

===Structure of the book===

Every chapter told by the first-person narrator in the (changing) late 20th century reality is followed by one in the German past. These early such chapters depict Hitler&#x27;s father, an abusive husband and father and a petty tyrant in his job as a customs inspector; Hitler&#x27;s mother, a gentle and sensitive woman escaping into fantasy from the harsh reality of her life; the 10-year old Adolf Hitler standing up to his father... Later chapters take place in the trenches of WWI, told from the point of view of Hitler&#x27;s comrades in arms: ordinary German combat soldiers, completely unaware of the hidden power struggle going on around them between the two potential leaders of the future Nazi Germany—Adolf Hitler and the charismatic officer Rudi Gloder. In one scene, Hitler tricks Gloder into a foolhardy heroic act and getting himself killed; but in the changed history, where Hitler was never born, it is Gloder who tricks another soldier into this act, and gets decorated for recovering his body. Later on, the ruthless Gloder murders a fellow soldier who discovered his opportunist machinations, followed by the past-war scene where Gloder joins the budding Nazi Party in 1919 Munchen and becomes its star demagogue. The significance of some details in these past scenes only becomes clear much later. For example, there is an early scene where Hitler&#x27;s mother&#x27;s vomits when trying to draw water and getting out of the pump a stinking maggot-filled mass; this turns out at the book&#x27;s end to be the result of the protagonist sending back in time the rotting bodies of dead rats in order to prevent Hitler&#x27;s father from drinking the sterilizing water.

==Reception==
Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the comic tone of the book &quot;shockingly tasteless&quot; and &quot;deeply offensive&quot; given the subject matter.

Israeli researcher Asaf Ben Vered noted that &quot;The protagonist of &quot;Making History&quot; gets told that &quot;There are no Jews left in Europe&quot;. That result could not have been achieved solely by sterilizing Jewish men through the &quot;Braunau Water&quot;. In that case, in the 1990s there should have still been a big number of sad old and middle aged Jews with no progeny, and the Nazis could not have kept them completely hidden from the world. Plus, if only Jewish men were sterilized, at least some Jewish women would have let themselves be impregnated by non-Jewish men; in fact, Jewish religious law specifically stipulates that such children would be considered Jewish. (...) Anyway, why would Gloder do it at all? To be sure, he is an anti-semite, like many Germans of his time. But as seen from his cynically frank wartime diary, he is above all a completely ruthless and totally unprincipled opportunist, for whom German Nationalism and wartime heroism are simply tools to be used or discarded. He needed the Jewish nuclear scientists to develop nuclear bombs by 1938. He still needs them when entering a nuclear arms race with the US. Were the Jewish scientists and their families exempted from deportation to the &quot;Jewish Free State&quot;? Would they go on working for him when all other Jews were deported? (...) The book avoids the real moral dilemma which it could have easily posed and which would have made it a far more profound and thought-provoking work. Suppose the opportunist Gloder had altogether avoided the Final Solution, and contented himself with some anti-Jewish rhetoric. Which world would be worse? Our world – or a world with an entrenched Nazi dictatorship in Europe and a racist and homophobic America, but no gas chambers and ovens, six million Jews able to live out their life, even if under Nazi rule? Putting it this way, the protagonist would have needed at least some serious thinking and inner debate before proceeding as he does in the final chapters.&quot;

<doc id="719328" wikidata="Q592866" url="?curid=719328" title="Prime Minister of Tuvalu">
<text>The prime minister of [[Tuvalu]] is the country&#x27;s head of government. According to Tuvalu&#x27;s constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the parliament and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role.

Part V, section 62 of the Constitution of Tuvalu describes the vesting of the executive authority:
:(1) The executive authority of Tuvalu is primarily vested in the Sovereign, and the Governor-General as the representative of the Sovereign.
:(2) The executive authority so vested in the Sovereign shall be exercised in accordance with section 53 (performance of functions by the Head of State).

Following the parliamentary vote, the governor-general of Tuvalu is responsible for swearing in as the prime minister the person who commands the confidence of a majority of members of parliament.

Part V of the Constitution establishes the executive authority of Tuvalu and confirms that while the Prime Minister is the head of government, executive power is exercised by ministerial government, with Part V, section 67 to 69 establishing the role of the cabinet.

The office of prime minister was established when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978. However, the post is sometimes considered a continuation of the earlier office of chief minister, created in 1975. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on one occasion, the deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister until a new one is elected by parliament. The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election.

Part V, Section 63 of the Constitution of Tuvalu establishes the office of Prime Minister. Under section 64, the Prime Minister is elected by the members of parliament, with sections 64 to 67 describing what happens if the office of the Prime Minister becomes vacant, the removal from office of an incapacitated Prime Minister, the process for the suspension of the Prime Minister, and the effect of removal or suspension of the Prime Minister.

Until the Second Toafa Ministry in 2010, the prime minister also had the role of foreign minister. Enele Sopoaga was the foreign minister in the short-lived Second Toafa Ministry. In subsequent ministries, foreign affairs was another minister&#x27;s responsibility in the cabinet.

Several former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.

Feleti Teo was appointed as prime minister on 26 February 2024, after he was elected unopposed by the parliament.

==List of prime ministers==
Toaripi Lauti was the Chief Minister of the Ellice Islands from 1975 to 1978 when Tuvalu became an independent country. He became the first Prime Minister of Tuvalu after that.
Notes

# Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana. 
# Sir Iakoba Italeli resigned as Governor-General on 22 August 2019 to contest a seat in parliament in the 2019 general election.
# Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani was appointed as Governor-General on 29 September 2021, during the term of prime minister Kausea Natano
# King Charles III acceded to the throne on 8 September 2022, during the term of prime minister Kausea Natano.

<text>Criminal psychology, also referred to as criminological psychology, is the study of the views, thoughts, intentions, actions and reactions of criminals and suspects. It is a subfield of criminology and applied psychology.

Criminal psychologists have many roles within legal courts, including being called upon as expert witnesses and performing psychological assessments on victims and those who have engaged in criminal behavior. Several definitions are used for criminal behavior, including behavior punishable by public law, behavior considered immoral, behavior violating social norms or traditions, or acts causing severe psychological harm. Criminal behavior is often considered antisocial in nature. Psychologists also help with crime prevention and study the different types of programs that are effective to prevent recidivism, and understanding which mental disorders criminals are likely to have.

== History ==
Criminal psychology started the late 18th century&quot;.&quot; The first seeds of forensic psychology were planted in 1879 when Wilhelm Wundt, often referred to as the father of psychology, founded his first lab in Germany. Before criminal psychology, there was a conflict in criminal law between medical experts and court judges on determining how to proceed with a majority of cases which specialized the development of a specialized field for individual investigations and assessments of suspects. It is generally accepted that criminal psychology was a predecessor to the broader field of criminology, which includes other fields such as criminal anthropology which studies more systemic aspects of crime as opposed to individual suspects and court cases.

== Profiling ==

Criminal profiling, also known as offender profiling, is a form of criminal investigation, linking an offender&#x27;s actions at the crime scene to possible characteristics. This is a practice that lies between the professions of criminology, forensic science and behavioral science. Most commonly used for homicide and sexual cases, criminal profiling helps law enforcement investigators narrow down and prioritize a pool of suspects. Part of a sub-field of forensic psychology called investigative psychology, criminal profiling has advanced substantially in methodology and grown in popularity since its conception in the late 1800s. However, there is a substantial lack of empirical research and effectiveness evaluations validating the practice of criminal profiling. Due to the lack of empirical research, it is important that criminal profiling is used as a tool in investigative cases. Cases should not depend on solely the profile but as well as traditional techniques as well.

Criminal profiling is a process now known in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as criminal investigative analysis. (see also: &quot;FBI method of profiling&quot;) Profilers, or criminal investigative analysts, are trained and experienced law enforcement officers who study every behavioral aspect and detail of an unsolved violent crime scene, in which a certain amount of psychopathology has been left at the scene. The characteristics of a good profiler are discussed. Five behavioral characteristics that can be gleaned from the crime scene are described:

# amount of premeditation,
# degree of control used by the offender,
# escalation of emotion at the scene,
# risk level of both the offender and victim, and
# appearance of the crime scene (disorganized versus organized).

The process of interpreting the behavior observed at a crime scene is briefly discussed.

In a 2017 article by Pew Research Center, it was found that federal and state prisons in the United States held 475,900 inmates who were African American and 436,500 who were white. Similar historical data supports the substantially higher incarceration of African American people. This is in contrast with census data which has placed the percentage of African American people at about 12% of the US population. Negative ethnic stereotypes contribute to this disproportionate incarceration; it has served as a justification for the unofficial policies and practices of racial profiling by criminal justice practitioners.

The cultural, environmental and traditional concepts of communities play a major role in individual psychology, providing profilers with a potential basis for behavioral patterns learned by offenders during their upbringing. They also evaluate the safety of prisons for those incarcerated, as some individuals may be predisposed to recidivism if the prisoners&#x27; mental health is not adequately addressed. There are several individual factors contributing to developing a criminal profile that both meets legal requirements and treats individuals humanely.

==Comparison to forensics==
The effect of psychosocial factors on brain functioning and behavior is a central part of analysis for both forensic and criminal psychologists, under the category of applied psychology. For forensic psychiatry, major areas of criminal evaluations include assessing the ability of an individual to stand trial, providing an opinion on what the mental state of the individual was at the time of offense risk management for future offenses (recidivism), providing treatment to criminals including medication and psychotherapy, and being an expert witness. This process often involves psychological testing. Forensic psychologists have similar roles to forensic psychiatrists, although are unable to prescribe medication. Criminal psychologists focus on research, profiling, and educating/assisting law enforcement with the detainment of suspects.

Criminal and forensic psychologists may also consider the following factors:

#The current presence of mental disorders and disabilities
#The level of accountability or responsibility an individual has for a crime due to mental disorders
#Likelihood of recidivism and involved risk factors
#Epidemiology of related mental disorders under consideration
#The motivation behind why a crime was committed.
Criminal psychology is also related to legal psychology, forensic psychology and crime investigations.

The question of competency to stand trial is to question of an offender&#x27;s current state of mind. This assesses the offender&#x27;s ability to understand the charges against them, the possible outcomes of being convicted/acquitted of these charges and their ability to assist their attorney with their defense. The question of sanity/insanity or criminal responsibility is an assessment of the offender&#x27;s state of mind at the time of the crime. This refers to their ability to understand right from wrong and what is illegal. The insanity defense is rarely used, as it is very difficult to prove. If declared insane, an offender may be committed to a secure hospital facility, potentially for much longer than they would have served in prison.

== Crime Prevention ==
There are several programs that attempt to help teens and young adults that are having disciplinary problems and involvement with the law. These programs include &quot;Scared Straight&quot;, Boot Camps, and rehabilitation. Research shows that these programs are ineffective or that they may even increase the likelihood of participants reoffending. In order for these interventions to be effective the person needs to voluntarily accept treatment. Research has shown that the most effective methods for preventing recidivism &quot;are&quot; Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) or rehabilitation programs that teach skills necessary to continue living after the duration of the programs. There are several therapies that are used to help criminals:

* Intensive Multimodal Cognitive Therapy
* Anger Management
* Motivational Interviewing
* Dialectical Behavior Therapy
* Schema Modal Therapy
* Functional Family Therapy
* Group-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
* Mentorship Programs

* Multidimensional Family Therapy

The goal of these therapies is to help violent offenders cope and avoid committing crimes after being released. Research on in-patient therapy methods showed to not help criminals. There are risk management tools that are used to assess criminals or people who are becoming involved with the law. There is evidence that these tools help with violence and crime, but health professionals have mixed reviews on if they are effective. Research supports that Multisystemic Therapy did not have an effect on preventing crime or reoffending in juveniles.

== Different types of mental disorders within the system ==
The criminal justice system has a wide variety of people that are incarcerated, some of these people have mental illness or disabilities. Some people that are in the system come from lower socioeconomic status and have childhood trauma that later results in mental illness, and this increases the likelihood of them being involved with the law at a young age.

Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is caused by a pregnant mother consuming alcohol. This can cause the individual to have issues with decision-making, substance abuse, and the ability to function. They are more likely to commit crimes around the age of 12, which can include drug offenses, shoplifting, and sex crimes.

Some people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are incarcerated, but not more than a non-autistic person. There is a difference though between gender and age. Male teenagers are more likely to have altercations with the law. When the altercations do occur they most often include crime related to stalking, drugs, theft/property damage.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is another mental illness that inmates may have, and this can be co-morbid with other disorders, such as depression, anxiety, substance use and personality disorders. The most common co-morbid disorders among criminals is depression and substance use disorder. The inmates with PTSD are most likely to be violent with other inmates and commit more violent crimes.

Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is another disorder that criminals are likely to have. This disorder can also be co-morbid with disorders like conduct disorder and later on can develop into antisocial personality disorder. People with ADHD often commit crimes such as assault, sex crimes, homicide, and drug charges. After being released from jail/prison people with ADHD are more likely to reoffend quicker than inmates that do not have ADHD.

== Career paths ==
A bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology or criminal justice as well as a master&#x27;s degree in a related field are needed in order to pursue a career in criminal psychology. A doctorate, either a Ph.D. or a Psy.D, typically yields higher pay and more lucrative job opportunities. In addition to degrees, a licensing exam is required by state or jurisdiction.

Criminal profilers require a master&#x27;s degree or a doctorate, several years of experience and in some cases passing state examinations to become a licensed psychologist.

Criminal profilers can work in various settings including offices and courtrooms and can be employed at a number of institutions. Some include local, state, or federal government, and others can be self-employed as independent consultants. , the average amount of a criminal psychologist is $58,246 and can increase to $95,000. Several factors contribute to how much a person makes within the field, including how much time a person has worked within the field, and the city with which a person works in. Criminal psychologists who work within larger cities tend to make more than psychologists who work in lower populated cities. Those who work for hospitals or federal government tend to have a lower salary. Some of the top paying states for forensic psychologists are New Hampshire, Washington, New York, Massachusetts, and California.

<doc id="719333" wikidata="Q2364661" url="?curid=719333" title="Kwadi language">
<text>Kwadi is an extinct &quot;click language&quot; once spoken in the southwest corner of Angola. It became extinct around 1960. There were only fifty Kwadi in the 1950s, of whom only 4–5 were competent speakers of the language. Three partial speakers were known in 1965, but in 1981 no speakers could be found. Salvage work was carried out 2014 with two remembers who had acquired the language from an old speaker while they were children.

Although Kwadi is poorly attested, there is enough data to show that it is a divergent member of the Khoe family, or perhaps cognate with the Khoe languages in a Khoe–Kwadi family. It preserved elements of proto-Khoe that were lost in the western Khoe languages under the influence of Kxʼa languages in Botswana, and other elements that were lost in the eastern Khoe languages.

The Kwadi people, called &quot;Kwepe&quot; (&quot;Cuepe&quot;) by the Bantu, appear to have been a remnant population of southwestern African hunter-gatherers, otherwise only represented by the Cimba, Kwisi, and the Damara, who adopted the Khoekhoe language. Like the Kwisi they were fishermen, on the lower reaches of the Coroca River.

Kwadi was alternatively known by varieties of the words &quot;Koroka&quot; (&quot;Ba-koroka, Curoca, Ma-koroko, Mu-coroca&quot;) and &quot;Cuanhoca&quot;.
&quot;Zorotua&quot;, or &quot;Vasorontu&quot;, was apparently a dialect.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Kwadi is tentatively reconstructed as having the seven oral vowels the three nasal vowels . Diphthongs seem to have been and . The status of /ao/ is not certain, and /oa/, /ua/ may have been allophones.

===Tones===
The tone system is unclear, due to limited data and to the poor quality of recordings. At least two tones (high and low) are necessary to explain that data:

: &#x27;dog&#x27;, &#x27;fish&#x27;
: &#x27;meat&#x27;, &#x27;man, male&#x27;

===Consonants===
The following consonants are attested. Those is parentheses are doubtful: they are either found in only a single lexeme, or are plausible allophones of another consonant.

Only dental clicks remain. Proto-Khoe–Kwadi *ǃ, *ǂ, *ǁ are replaced with non-click consonants such as .

In disyllabic words, the second consonant is predominantly /m/, /n/, /l/, /d/, /b/, and it is possible those were the only consonants allowed within morphemes in native words, as would be typical for the area.

==Morphology==
===Pronouns===
Kwadi has personal pronouns for first and second person in singular, dual, and plural numbers. Pronouns have subject, object, and possessive cases. 1st person plural may have distinguished clusivity. Object pronouns are suffixed with &quot;-le/-de&quot;, except for the first person dual object pronoun, which is just &quot;mu&quot;. Possessive pronouns are the same as the subject form, except for the first person singular possessive pronoun, which is &quot;tʃi&quot;. Third person pronouns are simply the demonstratives, which are formed with a demonstrative base &quot;ha-&quot; followed by a gender/number suffix.

The known possessive pronouns are &quot;tʃi&quot; &#x27;my&#x27; and &quot;ha&quot; &#x27;his&#x27;. From the Khoe languages, it&#x27;s not expected that all pronouns have distinctive possessive forms.

===Nouns===
Kwadi nouns distinguished three genders (masculine, feminine, and common), as well as three numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Some nouns form their plural with suppletion. For example: &quot;tçe&quot; &quot;woman&quot; vs. &quot;tala kwaʼe&quot; &quot;women&quot;. The attested paradigm of nominal suffixes for masculine and feminine nouns is given below.

<text>&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror, or simply Tower of Terror, is a series of similar accelerated drop tower dark rides located at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, Tokyo DisneySea, Walt Disney Studios Park, and formerly located at Disney California Adventure. The attraction is inspired by Rod Serling&#x27;s anthology television series, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and takes place in the fictional Hollywood Tower Hotel in Hollywood, California. The Tokyo version features an original storyline not related to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and takes place in the fictional Hotel Hightower. All versions of the attraction place riders in a seemingly ordinary hotel elevator, and present a fictional backstory in which people have mysteriously disappeared from the elevator under the influence of a supernatural element many years previously.

The original version of the attraction opened at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, then named Disney-MGM Studios, at Walt Disney World in July 1994. A decade later, Disney began plans to add similar versions of the attraction to their newest parks at the Disneyland Resort in California, Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan, and Disneyland Paris. In California and Paris, Disney sought to use the popular attraction to boost attendance at the respective resorts&#x27; struggling new theme parks. The California and Tokyo versions of Tower of Terror opened in 2004 and 2006, respectively, while financial problems delayed the opening of the Paris version until 2007. The California version closed in January 2017 and was replaced by &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!, which was later incorporated into Avengers Campus in 2021.

The Tower of Terror buildings are among the tallest structures found at their respective Disney resorts. At , the Florida version is the second tallest attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort, with only Expedition Everest at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom being taller by . After its retheme, the structure at the Disneyland Resort is still the tallest building on the property, as well as one of the tallest buildings in Anaheim. At Disneyland Paris, it is the second tallest attraction.

==History==
===Development===

In the late 1980s, a second phase of development was being designed for Disneyland Paris (then known as Euro Disney). Included was a free-fall type ride in Frontierland that was to be named Geyser Mountain. It would have been part roller coaster and part free-fall ride that shot guests up a vertical shaft. The plan was scrapped, but was picked up by Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios (then named Disney-MGM Studios) as part of a massive expansion to their U.S. park. Several attractions had already been proposed, including &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Crimestoppers&quot;, which would be later made into Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland. Still needing a major &quot;E-ticket&quot; attraction, the idea of a drop-shaft ride came up and was chosen. There had been several proposed ideas for haunted attractions, including a ride based on Stephen King&#x27;s novels, a Vincent Price ghost tour, a Mel Brooks-narrated ride, a real hotel, an awards show honoring classic movie monsters starring Godzilla hosted by Eddie Murphy and Elvira, and a whodunit murder mystery, but none progressed into development.

Walt Disney Imagineering eventually took inspiration from Rod Serling&#x27;s anthology stories featured in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, as a foundation for the attraction&#x27;s original story. Imagineers mused that the attraction would be able to take guests into the Fifth Dimension that Serling always described as unlocking in every episode of the series. With the project in firm development, Disney licensed the rights to use the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; intellectual property from CBS. The Imagineering team settled on a 1930s-era Hollywood hotel with a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; theme, but a new ride system had to be built, which would allow both more capacity inside the ride and make the drop fast. Otis Elevator Company was tasked to create the vertical ride system, while Eaton-Kenway developed a ride vehicle that could drive itself horizontally. Joe Dante directed the ride&#x27;s preshow film.

Disney felt Rod Serling needed to be part of the attraction, although he had died almost two decades earlier. In order to include Serling in the attraction, Disney opted to hold auditions to cast his voice, with Carol Serling, Rod&#x27;s widow, serving as a consultant for the casting. After many auditions, Mark Silverman was chosen by Carol to provide her late husband&#x27;s voice. The archival footage of Serling used in the preshow was taken from the episode, &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot;. Silverman would later reprise this voice role for additional lines for the Disney California Adventure attraction. He also reprised the voice of Serling for the first-season finale of the 2019 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The child actor in the ride&#x27;s pre-show and ride experience is voiced by Kat Cressida, who also voices Constance Hatchaway in The Haunted Mansion.

The new ride was formally announced on September 30, 1991, and it was later described as a haunted attraction with a &quot;stomach-churning 130-foot drop&quot; for its finale, a contrasting experience to the friendlier Haunted Mansion attraction at Magic Kingdom. Site-clearing and preparation began in early 1992, and the original location was moved slightly after a sinkhole formed. The tower&#x27;s interior and exterior design took inspiration from existing Southern California landmarks, including the Biltmore Hotel and Mission Inn. The distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural features that are present on and around the attraction&#x27;s roof were designed so that the rear facade would blend with the skyline of the Morocco Pavilion at Epcot, which is located less than two miles from Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios. After construction ended, the ride was initially set to open on July 4, 1994. However, the Tower of Terror opened on July 22, 1994, along with the Sunset Boulevard section of Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios.

===Engineering===
The ride system employs specialized technology developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, particularly the ability to move the vehicle in and out of the vertical motion shaft. The elevator cabs are self-propelled automated guided vehicles, which lock into separate vertical motion cabs. The cabs can move into and out of elevators horizontally, move through the &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; scene, and on to the drop shaft. The Florida ride runs on a unique loop system, with two identical ride systems built within the Tower. There are four shafts in the back section of the building containing the dark-ride portion of the attraction. After the corridor scene, the four shafts merge into two, identical &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; scenes, and then a cab enters the single drop shaft. After the drop sequence, the elevators unload in the building&#x27;s basement, then return to one of the show shafts to re-load the next guests. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror initially featured a single drop until May 1996, when the ride was upgraded with a second one. A third drop was added three years later in 1999. In January 2003, the attraction&#x27;s triple drop was replaced with randomized multi-drop sequences selected by a computer within the ride.

In order to achieve the weightless effect the Imagineers desired, cables attached to the bottom of the elevator car pull it down at a speed slightly faster than what a free fall would provide. Two enormous motors are located at the top of the tower, measuring tall, long, and weighing . They are able to accelerate at 15 times the speed of normal elevators. They generate 275 times the torque of a Chevrolet Corvette engine, reaching top speed in 1.5 seconds. The ride&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Never the Same Fear Twice!&quot;, refers to the drop pattern being randomly selected by a computer before the ride begins. The drop reaches a top speed of . Initially, the attraction&#x27;s vehicles seated 22 guests, restrained by lap bars; in 2002, the vehicles each had a seat removed from the back row and lap bars were replaced by seatbelt restraints. The vehicles for Tokyo&#x27;s Tower of Terror still accommodate 22 guests, 7 in the first two rows and 8 in the third.

The design of the 199 ft (60.7 m) tall Tower of Terror was founded on advanced dynamic analysis to model the effects of moving parts on the structural and non-structural elements. Since the facility was intended to provide new and non-repeatable sensations to visitors, a very wide variety of elevator drops and sequences of downward and upward motions, spanning anywhere from 1 floor to 13 floors, were modeled. Each elevator drop mode was analyzed as a time history - in other words accelerations that change in time - applied to the entire structural system. The objective was to push the motion beyond a free fall and provide the thrill to riders while ensuring structural integrity and safety. In addition to the self-weight of the structure, when motors weighing 270 kilo-pounds (123 metric tons) move, the force they exert on the structure is amplified by an order of magnitude. The applied accelerations were tested in the model over a range of 1.0 g (32.2 feet/s/s or 9.81 m/s/s) to 2.5 g (80.5 feet/s/s or 24.5 m/s/s). In addition to strength requirements, the design applied very stringent deflection criteria. In the case of the tower, floors have to support cabs while in horizontal motion in and out of the elevators with minimal deflections to avoid blurry projection screens.

On August 13, 2014, video recording was added to the ride&#x27;s on-ride camera, as an additional offering included with the on-ride photo through Disney PhotoPass. This was the first ride at Walt Disney World to offer on-ride videos. Little over a month later, on September 18, 2014, on-ride videos were also added to Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at Magic Kingdom as well as TRON Lightcycle / Run when it opened on April 4, 2023, making it the only three attractions in Walt Disney World to offer both in-ride photos and videos.

==Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios version==
===Queue and preshow===

In the American and European versions of the attraction, guests make their way to the dilapidated Hollywood Tower Hotel through the front gate to enter the queue through overgrown gardens and then enter the hotel lobby. Once in the lobby, guests are ushered to the hotel library, which houses the hotel&#x27;s collection of books and antiques. With a crash of thunder and lightning, the power in the library goes out, except for a television set which crackles into life and plays the opening sequence from the fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, hosted by Rod Serling. The episode depicts the events of a stormy night in Hollywood 1939, where a powerful lightning bolt strikes the hotel and causes five people—an actor, a singer, a child star, her nanny, and a hotel bellhop—to vanish from the elevator, along with an entire wing of the building. Serling then tells guests that they&#x27;ll be stepping in a maintenance service elevator to become the stars of an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The television then turns off and then guests are directed through to the boiler room to board the elevator.

===Ride experience===
After guests are loaded into the elevator, the doors close, the lights dim and the elevator starts to ascend. Serling&#x27;s voice greets passengers to &quot;a most uncommon elevator about to ascend into your very own episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;&quot;. The elevator stops its ascent and the doors open to reveal a dimly-lit hotel corridor, with a single window at the end. The ghosts of the five missing passengers appear, causing a faint purple light, and ghostly wind. The ghosts beckon the guests to join them before disappearing in a burst of electricity that scatters throughout the corridor. The corridor lights dim, and the entire room fades to darkness, transforming into a field of stars. The window floats forward and morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.

The elevator doors close and the car continues its ascent, once more, opening its doors to a maintenance room. The elevator car exits from the lift shaft horizontally into the room, which slowly fades into darkness as it turns into The Fifth Dimension, an element frequently referred by Serling in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. Now, in total darkness, the car reaches a field of stars which splits open and the elevator enters a pitch-black vertical shaft. As Serling&#x27;s narration ends the elevator begins the drop sequence at a top speed of . At least once during the drop sequence, wide elevator doors in front of the riders open to reveal a view of the park, where the on-ride camera captures the in-ride photograph and video. One of four randomized profiles of drops and lifts are selected by a computer, where the ride vehicle drops or rises various lengths at different intervals. Some effects include projected images of the breaking window, wind effects, lightning flashes, and ominous blue-lit figures of the five ghostly original riders.

Once the elevator finishes its sequence, the car backs up into the hotel basement. A short clip plays, showing elements from the Season 5 opening sequence, along with the 1939 elevator passengers and Serling falling into the &quot;vortex&quot; seen in the Season 3 opening sequence. Serling welcomes back the guests and sends them off after their &quot;visit&quot; to the hotel, as he would normally close an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The car rotates and parks itself at the exit doors that lead to the unload area. Guests exit the elevator, leaving the hotel through the gift shop. After leaving the elevator, guests are led through a hotel corridor towards an old &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; desk of the hotel, converted to display the on-ride photographs, serviced by Disney PhotoPass. Guests can use their MagicBands to link the photograph and video to their My Disney Experience account via the RFID touchpoints.

===&quot;Summer Nightastic!&quot;===
In February 2010, Disney announced that the Tower of Terror would receive &quot;new lighting effects and a new addition&quot; as part of a summer entertainment package called &quot;Summer Nightastic!&quot;. The Fifth Dimension scene was mostly covered by black tarps with fiber-optic stars, and Serling&#x27;s voice was removed from just before the drop profile. Replacing it is music played in the drop shaft, along with a projected photograph of the riders just before they enter the drop shaft. Similar to the California and Paris versions of the ride, the riders disappear, leaving an empty elevator. A new drop profile was created for &quot;Summer Nightastic!&quot;, and replaced the other drop profiles on all rides. After the music played, three sudden, distorted bell rings were heard, which began the drop profile. The profile mainly consisted of utilizing the entire tower for the drop sequences, as compared to the numerous faux and shortened drops in the randomized version. The changes were implemented on June 5, 2010, but were officially introduced the day after. All changes were temporary, and lasted until August 14, 2010.

===&quot;Disney&#x27;s Jollywood Nights&quot; ===
On November 12, 2023, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios announced that a new show, Twilight Soirée at The Tip-Top Club would take place in the Courtyard of the Hollywood Tower Hotel, near the ride&#x27;s exit, as part of &quot;Disney&#x27;s Jollywood Nights&quot;.

==Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions==

While similar in concept and theme to the original attraction in Florida, the version of Tower of Terror at Disney California Adventure, which opened in 2004 and closed in 2017, and its sister attraction at Walt Disney Studios Park which opened in 2007, feature some significant differences. The exterior of these rides use architectural features reminiscent of Pueblo Deco styles found throughout Southern California during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The designs for this version were originally designed for the Paris park. However, when California Adventure was in need of an additional crowd-puller, the Paris version&#x27;s plans were used for its version. When financial troubles hit Disney&#x27;s Parisian resort, the attraction had to be put on hold.

The Paris version of the ride was green-lit in 2005 and was under construction in the center of the park, behind the &quot;La Terrasse&quot; seating area, by early 2006. Upon completion, it was joined by a new Hollywood Boulevard lined by faux movie sets. The attraction opened in 2007 and, unlike the American versions, it was constructed using concrete rather than steel due to French construction guidelines and standards, at a total cost exceeding €180 million.

The Paris and California versions were originally intended to be almost identical upon completion, but there are differences, notably the height of the building and the location of some rooms backstage, as well as other differences due to different construction and work regulations in France. In Paris, the default language for the pre-show library video and the ride is French, but can be changed to English by the Cast Member upon request. The library video is the same as the American version, but is dubbed in French and subtitled in English. These versions have a slightly different queue area. The boiler room scene in the queue area has two floors, instead of the one floor in the original Florida version. The two floors allow for one elevator in one shaft to have guests on the ride, while the other elevator of the same shaft was loading guests. There are three elevator shafts, with two elevators per shaft, for a total of six ride vehicles operating.

===New ride operation system===
Imagineers redesigned the ride system for the attraction in California and Paris and made some changes to the show scenes. Instead of the autonomous vehicle found in the original incarnation, the new ride system limits the elevator car to a single shaft, three shafts in total in the newer versions. Each shaft was its own separate ride with its own separate operating system. This makes it easier to repair individual areas of the attraction without causing the entire attraction to go down. Each shaft has the capacity to accommodate two vehicles operating from two load levels, each vehicle loading and unloading at the same point. The ride was designed so that one vehicle can be in its ride profile while the other is at its loading level, giving each ride shaft the ability to accommodate more riders. Disney used this ride system again for Tokyo DisneySea&#x27;s Hotel Hightower.

===Ride experience===
====California (2004–2017) and Paris (2007–2019)====
As the elevator doors close, the lights of the service elevator flicker out. The elevator itself is pushed into the shaftway by a mechanical arm in front of the doors. With a flash of lightning, the walls of the basement disappear altogether, leaving only a star field around the service doors with a rotating purple spiral. The elevator rises quickly, arriving at floor with large ornate mirror, and a door leading to a different section of the room. Lightning strikes the hotel and the lights of both the corridor and elevator to flicker out. A ghostly wind blows through a window and the reflection of riders in the elevator becomes distorted. With another blast, the elevator rumbles and shakes, and with a final blast of lightning, the electrified reflection disappears, leaving only the image of the empty elevator in the mirror as the doors close. The elevator descends (or ascends in shaft C) and opens to reveal a blue lighted corridor with an image of another elevator where ghosts of the five missing passengers appear. They beckon riders to join them before disappearing in a bolt of electricity which scatters throughout the floor. The lights dim, and the walls in the corridor become a star field, leaving just the other elevator. The other elevator doors open to reveal the lost passengers inside as both elevators appear to float through space.

The distant guests fall, then the distant elevator shatters, followed by the ride elevator falling. This version of the ride does not have a randomized drop sequence, so the ride experience is identical in every drop shaft, regardless of which floor passengers board on. Two small drops occur in pitch-black darkness, followed by a rise to the top of the tower as in-cabin lights flicker. The doors then open out to reveal the view from the top floor before the car drops briefly, pauses, and drops along the remainder of the shaft. The elevator then rises almost to the top, and immediately drops without stopping, in complete darkness. The elevator then ascends all the way to the top of the tower, shudders, and falls to the bottom of the shaft, to the area in between the two loading floors, with the elevator being finally returned to its load level and horizontally pulled back into place at the boiler room service doors. The service doors open and guests exit the hotel through the basement and the gift shop.

====&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror – A New Dimension of Chills (Paris, 2019–present)====

On September 10, 2019, it was announced that the Paris version would be &quot;reimagined&quot; to &quot;The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror – A New Dimension of Chills&quot;. The ride was enhanced with new ride profiles, drop sequences, effects, and storylines that expand upon the original one. According to Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald, the reimagining introduced three new &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; storylines, each starring the little girl who disappeared in the hotel&#x27;s elevator from the original story and the attraction&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror – A New Dimension of Chills, which opened on September 28, 2019.

===Closure of the California version===
On July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, Disney announced that the California version would be replaced by an attraction based on Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; film series, titled &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!, which opened in May 2017 and uses the same structure and ride system. This is the first American Disney attraction to be based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Marvel Entertainment having been wholly acquired by Disney in 2009).

Tower of Terror&#x27;s final day of operation at Disney California Adventure was January 2, 2017; the ride then closed January 3. In preparation for the closure, Disney began a &quot;farewell&quot; promotion of the ride on September 9, 2016, which featured a &quot;Late Check Out&quot; option to experience the drop portion of the ride in total darkness. The same audio would play, but the show scenes on the fifth and fourth floors would be completely dark. On the night of September 19 and early morning of September 20, the &quot;Hollywood Tower Hotel&quot; sign was removed to prepare for the new attraction. The other three Disney parks with versions of the Tower of Terror are unaffected, and Disney has stated that there are no plans to change the attraction in its other locations.

==Tokyo DisneySea version==
The attraction at Tokyo DisneySea is known simply as Tower of Terror and omits any connection or tie-in whatsoever with &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, as the television series is not well known in Japan. Instead, the attraction focuses on an original storyline, set in the fictional Hotel Hightower. The ride tower is located in the American Waterfront area of the park, close to the &quot;S.S. Columbia&quot; ocean liner, and its facade is an example of Moorish Revival architecture. The ride system for this version is similar to that of the Disney California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park versions.

===Storyline===
The storyline of the attraction is more complex than that of its American and French counterparts. The scenario involves the adventures of the hotel&#x27;s famous builder and owner, Harrison Hightower III (modeled after Imagineering executive Joe Rohde), who went on many expeditions throughout the world and collected thousands of priceless artifacts. Most of these artifacts were stolen for personal gain and stored in his hotel, one of them is an idol named Shiriki Utundu, brought in by Hightower from an expedition to Africa. Hightower claimed that the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they threatened that the idol would curse him.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1899, Hightower held a press conference about his expedition to Africa, followed by a party, where he boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered the elevator to retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life. The idol&#x27;s rage and power caused the elevator to plummet and crash on the ground floor, with Hightower inside it; when the doors were pried open, only his hat and the idol were recovered. The hotel was abruptly closed and condemned for more than a decade, rumored by locals to be haunted. In 1912, following pressure to demolish the hotel, a New York restoration company reopened it because of its historical significance and now offers paid tours of the building. It is on these &quot;tours&quot; that guests embark when they enter the hotel.

===Queue and preshow===
The queue area winds through gardens filled with statues from many different countries up to the Hotel Hightower before guests then enter the lobby. On each ceiling arch is painted a mural of Hightower on one of his adventures, portraying his escape from native people with a valuable artifact or item in his possession. At the end of the lobby is the elevator in its destroyed state, its doors left open with only a single plank of wood holding them together. Guests are then ushered into a room filled with many photographs of Hightower, his expeditions, and his hotel.

Guests enter Hightower&#x27;s office, where a large stained glass window depicts a confident Hightower, while Shiriki Utundu sits on a pedestal nearby the stained glass. A tour guide talks about Hightower, then winds up an old gramophone that plays a recording of Hightower&#x27;s last interview. The lights dim and the stained glass window changes to show a frightened Hightower holding the idol, Hightower&#x27;s voice echoing throughout the office, warning guests the curse is real, and then entering the elevator on that fateful night, then shows the outside of the hotel. All throughout, as the elevator ascends, Hightower urging them to leave while they can. All the lights in the hotel go out, and a flash of green lightning shatters the bottom of the window. Shiriki Utundu comes to life, laughs mischievously at the guests, and vanishes into a star-field. A gray fog covers the window, which remains the same when the fog lifts. Guests are then ushered into an enormous storage room where Hightower kept his treasures.

===Ride experience===
The mechanics of DisneySea&#x27;s Tower of Terror are identical to the installations at Disney California Adventure (California) and Walt Disney Studios Park (Paris), although there are thematic changes. Also, the order of the mirror and corridor scenes is reversed compared to the American and European counterparts.

As the ride begins, a flash of electricity appears on top of the elevator doors, as the lights flicker and then go out. While the elevator is pushed backward, the ghost of Harrison Hightower III calls the riders fools, and explains the idol had cursed him to repeatedly experience the same fate. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness as the elevator enters the drop shaft. The elevator quickly ascends and the doors open at the penthouse floor, revealing the idol sitting on a table in the center of the room. Hightower&#x27;s spirit physically appears beside the idol and mocks it. The idol zaps him with a bolt of green electricity, blasting him backward past the open elevator doors at the opposite end of the apartments. Hightower falls down the shaft as the entire apartment fades away, and a starfield comes into view. The idol turns toward the guests&#x27; elevator and laughs before the doors close.

The elevator ascends again (in shaft C, it actually descends), and the doors reopen on the ballroom floor with a large ornate mirror on the back wall. Hightower tells the guests to wave and say &quot;goodbye&quot; to themselves. As they do, the lighting of the hotel is replaced with an eerie green glow, making the reflections of the guests seem ghostlike – an effect similar to the California and Paris rides. The ghostly reflection of the riders disappears and leaves the idol alone in the empty elevator. The idol laughs menacingly at the riders and suddenly shoots forward at them. The elevator vibrates, then begins the drop sequence. At the end of the drop sequence, the elevator returns to its loading level, where the idol&#x27;s green eyes glare one last time in the dark and then disappear as Hightower warns riders to never return.

==&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; references in the attraction==
In an effort to be true to the spirit of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, Disney Imagineers reportedly watched every episode of the original television show at least twice. The attraction buildings are littered with references to &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes.

===Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios===
* The Mystic Seer machine from the episode &quot;Nick of Time&quot; can be seen sitting on the high shelf in the libraries, near the television.
* The book titled &quot;To Serve Man&quot;, from the episode of the same name, is seen in both libraries.
* Chalk marks can be seen on one of walls of the waiting area that leads from the elevator unload, a reference to the episode &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;. In Paris, this can be found in the upper level of the boiler room next to the attraction warning signage; a similar version was present in Disney&#x27;s California Adventure.
* The slot machine from the episode &quot;The Fever&quot; is seen in one of the unload areas.
* The ventriloquist dummy Caesar from the episode &quot;Caesar and Me&quot; is present in both unload areas.

* A poster advertising &quot;Anthony Fremont&#x27;s Orchestra&quot; is displayed next to the concierge desk in the lobby, an ironic reference to Anthony Fremont, the young boy with god-like powers from the episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot;, since he had a strong dislike for singing. This poster was displayed in the photo gallery at Disney California Adventure.
* On the concierge&#x27;s desk, an issue of &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine sits open to an article titled &quot;Four Pages of Hilarious Star Caricatures by Walt Disney&quot;.

===Disney California Adventure===
* A door with the number 22 in brass numbering was present in the hotel lobby as a reference to the episode &quot;Twenty Two&quot;.
* A Shirley Temple doll sat on the hotel lobby, similar to the one at Walt Disney Studios.
* Outside the library in the glass case adjacent to the doors, there is a gold thimble accompanied by a card that reads, &quot;Looking for a gift for Mother? Find it in our Gift Shop!&quot;. This is a reference to the episode &quot;The After Hours&quot;.

===Walt Disney Studios Park===
* A dusty old doll sits on a couch in the hotel lobby, believed to be Talky Tina from the episode &quot;Living Doll&quot;, the little girl in the attraction&#x27;s pre-show and experience or Sally Shine from the 1997 movie &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;.
* The queue of the Disneyland Paris version features a reference to the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Little Girl Lost&quot;. Chalk marks on the walls are in the same style as those in the episode, when people were trying to find the portal to the girl. This can be found in the upper level of the boiler room next to the attraction warning signage. Periodically the girl&#x27;s voice can be heard calling out for help from the wall and from the radios around the boiler room. In Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, this can be seen on one of walls of the waiting area that leads from the elevator unload.
* Upon exiting, the display cases on the ground floor contain advertisements for, among other things, a &quot;Housemaid Wanted&quot; (a reference to the episode &quot;I Sing The Body Electric&quot;) and for &quot;A Pair of Reading Glasses Wanted&quot; (&quot;Time Enough At Last&quot;).
* From the episode &quot;The Invaders&quot;, the eponymous characters are found on display in both libraries; they are also present in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios.

===Florida, California and Paris===
* The pre-show includes a little girl holding a hidden Mickey in the form of a Mickey Mouse plush toy; this one appears again in the corridor scene. A hidden Mickey can also be found in each corner of the library&#x27;s carpet pattern. A third hidden Mickey exists in one of the libraries in the form of a sheet music of the 1932 song &quot;What! No Mickey Mouse? (What Kind of Party is This?)&quot;, composed by Irving Caesar.
* The trumpet from &quot;A Passage for Trumpet&quot; can be seen in one of the libraries.
* The elevator has an inspection certification, signed by Mr. Cadwallader, the sinister deal-maker from the episode &quot;Escape Clause&quot;. The last inspection date of the elevator is October 31, 1939, the very same night lightning struck the Hollywood Tower Hotel. Its certification number is 10259, a nod to October 2, 1959, the date &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; first aired.
* The flying saucer from the episode &quot;The Invaders&quot; is present hanging from the ceiling in the unload areas.
* The corridor scene was heavily inspired by the 1985 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; opening sequence where the intro shows a room with a window at the end. At the end of the intro, the room becomes a star field, and the window morphs into the title. This is referenced in every version of the ride, including the version in Japan, where the entire corridor/penthouse becomes a star field. The window in the Hollywood Studios version morphs into the one shown in the Season 5 intro of the original show.
* &quot;Picture If You Will...&quot;, a phrase Rod Serling often used in various &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes, appears in the area where guests purchase their on-ride photo; in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, this phrase appears in the area where guests scan their park ticket or MagicBand for their on-ride photo and video.
* In promotional television commercials for the attraction, an elevator&#x27;s floor indicator outside the doors can be seen with its needle pointing past the 12th floor to the 13th, a reference to the 9th floor in the episode &quot;The After Hours&quot;.
* Although not a reference to &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, there is a felt letter board with the hotel&#x27;s directory for amenities, located between the inoperable elevators in the lobby, with missing letters that have fallen to the bottom of the board to spell a message. In Orlando, the message spells &quot;TAKE THE STAIRS&quot;, while in Paris, the message spells &quot;COME WITH ME&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
Jazz music from the 1930s is played throughout the queueing area for the Tower of Terror at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, as well as in the lobby and library. The ride&#x27;s score was composed by Richard Bellis, except for the Tokyo DisneySea version, which was scored by Joel McNeely, who has released the overture on his site. Bellis incorporates the main &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; theme, composed by Marius Constant, to the attraction&#x27;s theme, which can be found on several theme park albums:
* &quot;Disneyland/Walt Disney World Music Vacation&quot; (as part of a medley)
* &quot;Walt Disney World Resort: The Official Album&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Walt Disney World Resort: Official Album&quot; (2000)
* &quot;Official Album: Walt Disney World Resort Celebrating 100 Years of Magic&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The Official Album of the Disneyland Resort&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Disneyland Resort: Official Album&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Walt Disney World: Official Album&quot; (2013)
* &quot;Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection – Disneyland&quot; (2015)

==In media==
===In television===
&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror was featured in the 1994 Halloween edition of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Walt Disney World Inside Out&quot;, hosted by Scott Herriott, where guest star Gilbert Gottfried set out to experience Tower of Terror himself. The attraction is also one of various featured in the Disney+ docu-series &quot;Behind the Attraction&quot;, produced by Dwayne Johnson, released on July 21, 2021. The episode dedicated to the attraction also features the Tokyo variant and the transformation of the Disney California Adventure version to &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!.

===Television film adaptation===

Following the attraction&#x27;s success, Walt Disney Television produced the TV film &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;, starring Steven Guttenberg and Kirsten Dunst. Based on the attraction itself and not &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, it is Disney&#x27;s first film based on one of its theme park attractions and the only one made for television to date. Many scenes were filmed in the attraction at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, when it was still named Disney-MGM Studios, while other scenes were filmed in Disney&#x27;s Burbank studios.

===Film adaptation===
On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a new film based on the attraction, starring Scarlett Johansson, who would also produce the project through her production company, These Pictures, alongside Jonathan Lia, while Josh Cooley would write the script. Development on the film was initially canceled following Johansson&#x27;s lawsuit against Disney after the company released the Marvel film &quot;Black Widow&quot; on the streaming service Disney+, but resumed after the lawsuit was settled.

<text>Ben Franklin is an unincorporated community in Delta County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 75 in 2000.

==History==
The population was 75 in 2010 and 2017.

The local Methodist church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On April 2, 1957, an F2 tornado destroyed six homes and damaged several others in Ben Franklin. Two people were injured and losses totaled $25,000. This and a previous event may have belonged to the same family. Grazulis listed the tornado as the same as the Ambia–Harmon F2s, considering all three to be a F3 event. One death was reported.

<doc id="719360" wikidata="Q7363550" url="?curid=719360" title="Ron Boswell">
<text>Ronald Leslie Doyle Boswell (born 9 December 1940) is a former Australian politician. He was a Senator for Queensland from 1983 to 2014, representing the National Party. He was the party&#x27;s Senate leader from 1990 to 2007, a record term. He was also a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government from 1999 to 2003. He was Father of the Senate from 2008 until his retirement in 2014.

==Early life==
Boswell was born in Perth on 9 December 1940. In his memoirs he recalled a tumultuous childhood including &quot;two parental separations, frequent changes of school, and an abduction (by his mother, accompanied by her lover) to Melbourne&quot;.

Boswell spent his early years in Perth, attending five schools in six years. He moved to Brisbane after his father was transferred for work reasons, where he attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Gregory Terrace.

Boswell left school at the age of 14 and began working as an office boy at an insurance firm. He later worked as an insurance agent and travelling salesman, including selling paintbrushes. He first came into contact with Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen in his role as a manufacturers&#x27; agent, lobbying against the deregulation of weekend trading hours.

== Politics==
===Early involvement===

Boswell was convinced to join the National Party by his wife, a long-time member. He was elected chairman of the party&#x27;s Wynnum branch in 1974 and to the party&#x27;s central council in 1976, serving on its management committee and as a metropolitan vice-president. He was also chairman of the party&#x27;s fishing industry committee.

===Opposition (1983–1996)===
In 1982, Boswell won preselection for the third position on the National Party&#x27;s Senate ticket in Queensland, behind incumbent senators Florence Bjelke-Petersen and Stan Collard. He was elected to a three-year Senate term at the 1983 federal election, which followed a double dissolution. In the lead-up to the election he hired a publicity officer &quot;to get his name known in provincial Queensland&quot;. He would be re-elected to the Senate on a further six occasions, in 1984, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007.

Prior to the 1984 election, Boswell controversially announced that he would deny supply to the Hawke government if it were re-elected, leading to a public rebuke from National Party leader Ian Sinclair.

In 1988, Boswell was added to John Howard&#x27;s shadow ministry, holding the regional development and external territories portfolio under Howard and his successor Andrew Peacock until 1990. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 1993 under John Hewson, holding the portfolios of Northern Australia and external territories. He was moved to the consumer affairs portfolio in May 1994 after Alexander Downer became opposition leader. In December 1994 he and five other conservative senators crossed the floor to vote against the &quot;Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994&quot;, which guaranteed sexual privacy. Downer supported the legislation and Boswell consequently resigned from the shadow cabinet.

Following a National Party leadership spill after the 1990 election, Boswell was elected as the party&#x27;s Senate leader, defeating David Brownhill. He would retain the position for a record 17 years, until stepping down after the 2007 election.

===Howard government (1996–2007)===
Boswell was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in July 1999 but left the position in October 2003. After he was succeeded as leader of the Nationals in the Senate by Nigel Scullion following the 2007 election, Boswell became Scullion&#x27;s deputy. He was succeeded in that position by Fiona Nash in 2008.

Boswell&#x27;s bid for re-election at the 2001 election was framed as a head-to-head contest between him and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson for Queensland&#x27;s sixth Senate seat. In his valedictory speech to the Senate in 2014, he stated that he &quot;risked everything to stand up against her aggressive, narrow view of Australia [...] defeating Pauline Hanson and One Nation in 2001 has been my greatest political achievement&quot;. He was an outspoken opponent of other far-right groups such as the League of Rights and the Citizens Electoral Council, in 1988 denouncing the League of Rights as &quot;racist, anti-semitic and neo-Nazi&quot;.

===Final years (2007–2014)===
Boswell reluctantly announced his support for the merger of the Nationals and Liberals in 2008, seeing the creation of the Liberal National Party of Queensland as &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot; following suggestions that a new standalone conservative party should be created.

In 2011, Boswell was a critic of the then Australian Government&#x27;s carbon emissions trading scheme. He called for the scheme to be abandoned. On 17 September 2012, during a Senate debate on a proposed marriage inequality bill, Boswell spoke out against same sex marriage in Australia stating: &quot;Two mothers or two fathers can’t raise a child properly. Who takes the boy to football? Who tells him what&#x27;s right from wrong? What does he do? Go along with mum, or two mums? How does he go camping or fishing? It won’t work, it’s defying nature!&quot;

Boswell announced on 21 September 2012 that he did not intend to seek re-election in 2013 and would retire when his Senate term expired in 2014.

==Personal life==
In 1966, Boswell married Leita Beattie, who worked as a schoolteacher at Moreton Bay College for over 40 years. He was widowed in 2021.

Boswell published his memoirs, &quot;Ron Boswell: Not Pretty, But Pretty Effective&quot;, in December 2023.
