<text>Henri de Bourbon, 2nd [[Prince of Condé]] (29 December 1552 – 5 March 1588) was a French &quot;prince du sang&quot; and Huguenot general like his more prominent father, Louis I, Prince of Condé.

==Life==
Henri was the eldest son of Louis de Bourbon and Eléanor de Roye, daughter and heiress of Charles de Roye, Count of Roucy. Of the eight children in his family, he and his brother François, Prince of Conti, were the only ones to have children.
Following the death of his father, Louis, at the Battle of Jarnac, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret introduced Henri and her own son, Henry of Navarre, as pages to Admiral Coligny. Since both were &quot;princes of the blood&quot;, this act gave the Huguenot cause legitimacy.

At the Battle of Moncontour on 3 October 1569, Henri was wounded in the face and was forced to retreat. Attending the wedding of Henry of Navarre and the subsequent massacre of Protestants, Henri was forced to convert to Catholicism, face death or life imprisonment. In his escape from Paris, Henri was joined by Theodore Beza, who published his &quot;Du droit des magistrats sur leurs sujets&quot; in Germany.

By 1573 the Huguenot cause had made some political gains in the Midi, consequently Henri was assigned &quot;governor general and protector&quot;. Following the Peace of Monsieur, he was restored to his governorship of Picardy. During the sixth war of religion, he commanded the forces that captured Brouage and allowed English aid for the Huguenots. And, it would be Henri, angered by Catholic resistance to his governorship of Picardy, who started the seventh war of religion by seizing the town of La Fère in November 1579.

In 1588, Henri died at Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély after a brief illness.

==Marriages==
He married twice, first to his cousin, Marie of Cleves. With Marie, Henri had one child:

* Catherine (30 October 1574 – 30 December 1595), Marquise of Isles, never married.

Secondly, Henri married his second cousin once removed, Charlotte Catherine de La Tremoille (1568–1629), daughter of Louis III de La Trémoille. They had at least two children:

* Éléonore de Bourbon (1587–1619), married in 1606 to Philip William, Prince of Orange.
* Henri II, Prince of Condé (1588–1646)

<text>Malmö Fotbollförening (), commonly known simply as Malmö FF or MFF, is a Swedish professional football club based in Malmö, Scania. They compete in the Allsvenskan, the top division of Swedish football, and play home matches at the Eleda Stadion. Malmö FF is Sweden&#x27;s most successful football club in terms of domestic trophies won. They hold 24 Swedish championships and 16 Svenska Cupen titles, both of which are national records.

The club formed in 1910 and is affiliated with the Scania Football Association, winning its first national championship in 1944. Their most successful period was the 1970s, during which they won five Swedish championships, four Svenska Cupen titles, and became the only side from the Nordic countries to have reached the a European Cup or UEFA Champions League final. They finished as runner-up in the 1978–79 European Cup, losing 1–0 to English club Nottingham Forest in the final. For this feat, Malmö FF was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;1978/79: Forest join élite club&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Malmö FF also became the only Nordic side to be represented at the Intercontinental Cup, the predecessor of the FIFA Club World Cup, by competing in the tournament&#x27;s 1979 edition. The club is the leader of the overall Allsvenskan table maratontabellen, meaning that they have won the most matches of any side in Allsvenkan history. They also lead the table in terms of total goals scored.

Malmö FF is nicknamed &quot;Di blåe&quot; (Scanian for &quot;The Blue Ones&quot;), and their colours are sky blue and white. This is reflected in their kit: sky blue shirts, white shorts and sky blue socks. They have two long-standing rivalries: a regional derby with fellow Scanian club Helsingborg and a competitive rivalry with IFK Göteborg. Another historical rivalry exists with local Division 2 Södra Götaland side IFK Malmö. The MFF Support are their official fan club.

==History==
===Early years===
The club arose from a municipal initiative in 1905 to encourage young people in Malmö to play organised football. One of the youth teams, Bollklubben Idrott, also known simply as BK Idrott, was a predecessor to Malmö FF. BK Idrott joined the newly created football department of IFK Malmö in 1909, but soon left because of issues between the two clubs. On 24 February 1910 the 19 members of BK Idrott founded Malmö FF; the first chairman was Werner Mårtensson.

The club spent its first ten years in local and regional divisions as there was no official national league competition, playing the majority of their matches in the city division called the Malmömästerskapen. They also competed in regional competitions in Scania, and played matches against Danish clubs. In 1916 Malmö FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition (&quot;Distriktsmästerskapen&quot;) for the first time, playing against rivals Helsingborgs IF but losing 3–4. The club defeated local rivals IFK Malmö three times during the season, and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malmö&#x27;s best football club. In 1917 Malmö FF competed for the first time in Svenska Mästerskapet, a cup tournament for the title of Swedish champions, but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4–1 against IFK Malmö. The club continued to play in the cup until 1922, reaching the quarter-finals in 1920 when they were knocked out by Landskrona BoIS. The cup was eventually discontinued and the title of Swedish champions was given to the winners of the Allsvenskan which was first created for the 1924–25 season.

In 1920 the Swedish Football Association invited Swedish football clubs to compete in official national competitions. Malmö FF earned a place in the Division 2 Sydsvenska Serien. They won this division in the first season, and were promoted to the Svenska Serien Västra, the highest level of competition in Sweden at the time. However, they were relegated after a single season, and found themselves back in Sydsvenska Serien for nearly a decade until they again achieved promotion to Allsvenskan, in 1931.

===First years in the Allsvenskan and early achievements===

The club achieved mid-table league positions for two seasons, but was relegated in 1934 as a penalty for breaking amateur regulations. The club had paid their players a small sum of money for each game. Although against the rules, this was common at the time; Malmö FF was the only club to show it in the accounting records. In addition to relegation to Division 2, the club suffered bans for the entire board of directors and twenty-six players. The version of events told by Malmö FF and local press suggests that local rival, IFK Malmö, had reported the violation to the Swedish Football Association. This belief has contributed to the longstanding competitive tensions between the clubs.

The club made their way back to the Allsvenskan in 1937 after two seasons in the Division 2. In the same year Eric Persson was elected as chairman after being secretary since 1929, and held the position until 1974. Persson is regarded by club leaders and fans as the most important person in the club&#x27;s history, as he turned the club professional in the 1970s. Under his leadership the club went from being titleless in 1937 to holding ten Swedish championships by the end of the 1974 season. In 1939 the club reached its highest position yet, third place in the Allsvenskan, nine points behind champions IF Elfsborg. Malmö FF&#x27;s first Swedish championship came in 1944, when the club won the penultimate game of the season against AIK before 36,000 spectators at the Råsunda. The last game of the season was won 7–0 against Halmstad BK.

The following nine seasons, Malmö FF finished in the top three in the league. The club won the Swedish Championship in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953, and were runners-up in 1946, 1948 and 1952. The club also won the Svenska Cupen in 1944, 1946, 1947, 1951 and 1953, and finished as runners-up in 1945. Between 6 May 1949 and 1 June 1951, the team were unbeaten in 49 matches, of which 23 were an unbroken streak of victories.
The club finished as runners-up in the Allsvenskan twice more, in 1956 and 1957. The following year the club left Malmö IP for Malmö Stadion, which had been built for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, and was to host the club for 50 years. In 1964 Malmö FF contracted Spanish manager Antonio Durán; this was the first of a series of changes that led to the most successful era in the club&#x27;s history. Young talents such as Lars Granström and Bo Larsson emerged during the early 1960s and would prove to be crucial ingredients in the success that would come in the 1970s. The club finished second in 1964 but went on to win their sixth Swedish Championship in 1965, when Bo Larsson scored 28 goals to finish as the league&#x27;s top goal scorer. Malmö FF once again won the Allsvenskan in 1967, after a less successful year in 1966. The club&#x27;s young players, as well as talents bought in from neighbouring clubs in Scania in 1967, became a team that consistently finished in the top three in the Allsvenskan.

===Successful 1970s, European Cup 1979, 1980s and 1990s===
After finishing as runners-up in Allsvenskan for the final two years of the 1960s, Malmö FF started the most successful decade of their history with a Swedish Championship in 1970. The club won Allsvenskan in 1970, 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1977 as well as Svenska Cupen in 1976 and 1978. The 1977 Allsvenskan victory qualified the club for the 1978–79 European Cup, and after victories against AS Monaco, Dynamo Kyiv, Wisła Kraków and Austria Wien, Malmö FF reached the final of the competition, which was played at the Olympiastadion in Munich against Nottingham Forest. Trevor Francis, who scored the only goal of the match, won it 1–0 for Nottingham Forest. Nevertheless, the 1979 European Cup run is the biggest success in the history of Malmö FF. The team were given the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal the same year, awarded for the most significant Swedish sporting achievement of the year, for their achievement in the European Cup.
Much of the success during the 1970s was due to new tactics and training methods brought to the club by Englishman Bob Houghton, who managed the club between 1974 and 1980. Eric Persson was succeeded as chairman in 1974 by Hans Cavalli-Björkman. After the team performed respectably under managers Keith Blunt and Tord Grip in the early 1980s, Roy Hodgson took over in 1985. Roy Hodgson led Malmö FF to two Swedish Championships in 1986 and 1988, and the club won Allsvenskan five years in a row between 1985 and 1989. At the time, the championship was decided by play-offs between the best teams after the end of the regular season; this arrangement was in place from 1982 until 1992. The club reached the play-off final four times between 1986 and 1989 but only managed to win the final twice. Apart from Allsvenskan and Swedish Championships, Malmö FF won Svenska Cupen in 1984, 1986 and 1989.

Other than finishing as runners-up in Allsvenskan in 1996, the team did not excel in the 1990s, as the club failed to win Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen throughout the entire decade. The 1990s ended with relegation from Allsvenskan in 1999. Hans Cavalli-Björkman was succeeded as chairman by Bengt Madsen in 1999, and former player Hasse Borg was contracted as Director of Sport. These operational changes, as well as the emergence of young talent Zlatan Ibrahimović, led to the return to Allsvenskan in 2001. Ibrahimović rose to fame and became an important player in Malmö FF&#x27;s campaign to return to the top league. He was later sold to Ajax in 2001, before playing for several European clubs in Italy&#x27;s Serie A, FC Barcelona in Spain&#x27;s La Liga, Paris Saint-Germain in France&#x27;s Ligue 1, Manchester United F.C. in England&#x27;s Premier League, LA Galaxy in the MLS, and AC Milan again until his retirement in 2023.

===Start of the 2000s to the present===

The return to Allsvenskan was the start of the successful early 2000s, under the management of Tom Prahl, when the club finished in the top three times in a row. In 2004, it won Allsvenskan, the club&#x27;s fifteenth Swedish Championship. In 2005, the club reached the last qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League but were defeated by FC Thun. Successful sponsor work and player sales also made Malmö FF the richest club in Sweden. This position was further cemented by the successive Champions League group stage appearances the two following years. Malmö FF moved from Malmö Stadion to Eleda Stadion in 2009, a stadium built entirely for football and located next to the old one.

In 2009, Madsen announced that he would step down as chairman, and was replaced by Håkan Jeppsson early the following year.
In 2010, the club marked their 100th anniversary with many celebratory events at the beginning of the season. On the day of the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2010, the Swedish football magazine &quot;Offside&quot; declared Malmö FF to be the greatest football club in Swedish history. The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became Swedish champions for the sixteenth time. Unlike in 2004, these successes were achieved without any major transfers before the season, and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players.

In October 2013, Malmö FF won their seventeenth Swedish championship and 20th Allsvenskan title in the penultimate round of the league away from home. Similar to 2010, the title was the result of a young squad. The average age of the squad, 23.8 years, was the youngest team to become champions since the beginning of the 21st century. The following year Malmö FF qualified for the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League by beating Ventspils, Sparta Prague and Red Bull Salzburg in the qualifying rounds. This was the first time the club qualified for the competition proper since the re-branding from the European Cup in the 1992–93 season and the first time since the 2000–01 season that a Swedish club qualified. In the following months Malmö FF defended their league title, winning their eighteenth Swedish championship and 21st Allsvenskan title. This was the first time a club defended the Allsvenskan title since the 2003 season.

The 2015 season saw Malmö FF failing to retaining the title and missing out on the top-four for the first time since 2009. However, the club managed to qualify once again to the group stages of the UEFA Champions League in the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League edition, beating Žalgiris Vilnius, Red Bull Salzburg and Celtic in qualifiers. In October 2016, Malmö FF won their nineteenth Swedish championship and 22nd Allsvenskan title. The title was Malmö FF&#x27;s third in the span of four years. This resulted in the club surpassing IFK Göteborg in terms of Swedish championship titles, indisputably becoming the most successful Swedish football club of all time.

The 2020s have brought renewed national success to the club, winning the Allsvenskan in 2020, 2021, 2023 and 2024, reaching a total of 27 league titles, while reaching the Champions League group stage in the 2021–22 edition and reaching the knockout stages of the UEFA Europa League in 2019–20, under the management of Jon Dahl Tomasson and Henrik Rydström.

Malmö FF is a dominant force in Sweden. As of the end of the 2021 Allsvenskan season, the club are the leaders of the overall Allsvenskan table maratontabellen. Malmö FF are also the record holders for the total number of Swedish championships, Allsvenskan titles and Svenska Cupen titles.
==Colours and crest==
Because of the club colours, sky blue and white, the club is often known by the nicknames &quot;Di blåe&quot; (Scanian: The Blues) and &quot;Himmelsblått&quot; (The Sky Blues). The home kit is sky-blue shirts, white shorts, and sky-blue socks. The away strip is black. Various alternative kits have been used for European play such as an all-white kit introduced in the 1950s, and re-used for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and all-black kits with sky-blue and golden trimmings were used for the European campaigns in 2005 and 2013.

===Kit evolution===



The club colours have not always been sky blue. The predecessor club BK Idrott wore blue and white striped shirts and white shorts, and this kit was still used for the first six months of 1910 after Malmö FF was founded. This was later changed to red and white striped shirts and black shorts to show that Malmö FF was a new, independent club. This colour combination has on occasion been used in modern times as the away kit. The present sky-blue kit was introduced in 1920. Since 2010 a small Scanian flag is featured on the back of the shirt just below the neck.

===Crest evolution===
The crest of Malmö FF consists of a shield with two vertical sky-blue fields on the sides, and one vertical white field in the middle. Underneath the shield is &quot;Malmö FF&quot; spelled out in sky-blue letters with a sky-blue star under the text. In the top area of the shield is a white horizontal field over the three vertical fields. The abbreviation of the club name &quot;MFF&quot; is spelled out with sky-blue letters in this field. On top of the shield are five tower-like extensions of the white field. The present shield crest made its debut on the shirt in the 1940s. There were other crests before this but they were never featured on the shirt. While the first crest was black and white, the second crest was red and white in accordance with the club&#x27;s main colours between 1910 and 1920.

In the original shield logo the full club name and sky-blue star beneath the shield were not featured, they were later added when club chairman Eric Persson discovered while abroad that people had trouble identifying what city the club came from just by looking at the club crest. The six-pointed star has its origins from the oldest seal of the City of Malmö.

For the 100th anniversary of the club in 2010, the years 1910 and 2010 were featured on each side of the shield on a sky-blue ribbon behind the shield.

Malmö FF is the only Swedish club to wear two stars above its crest, representing at least 20 domestic championship titles. The stars are only featured on match shirts and are not part of the club&#x27;s crest.

==Supporters==


Malmö FF has several fan clubs, of which the largest is the official fan club MFF Support, founded in 1992. MFF Support describes itself as &quot;a non-profit and non-political organization working against violence and racism&quot;. The chairman of MFF Support is Thelma Ernst.

There are also several smaller independent supporter groups. The most prominent of these is Supras Malmö, which was founded in 2003 by a coalition of smaller ultras groups and devoted fans. The name &quot;Supras&quot; is derived from the words &quot;supporters&quot; and &quot;ultras&quot; – the latter indicating that the group is inspired by a fan culture with roots in southern Europe. Supras Malmö is the most visible group in the main supporter stand at Eleda Stadion, marking its presence with banners, flags and choreography. Another group with similar goals is Rex Scania. MFF Tifosi 96 (MT96) is a network of supporters creating tifos for special occasions and important games.
Malmösystrar (Sisters of Malmö) is the largest female supporter faction in Europe with over 200 members.

Malmö FF supporters maintains a friendship with the supporters of Hertha BSC.

===Rivalries===

Because of geographical proximity, minor rivalries exist with Trelleborgs FF and Landskrona BoIS, which are both also located in Scania. The main rivals of the club are Helsingborgs IF, IFK Göteborg and IFK Malmö. The rivalry between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF has existed since Malmö FF were promoted up to Allsvenskan in the 1930s, and is primarily geographic, since both teams are from Scania in southern Sweden. The rivalry with IFK Göteborg relates more to title clashes; the two are the most successful clubs in Swedish football history and the only two to have appeared in European cup finals, IFK Göteborg in the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987 and Malmö FF in the European Cup in 1979.

During the 2000s, a rivalry between Malmö FF and FC Copenhagen has grown stronger. The rivalry is mainly about geographical proximity and the fact that the teams have played against each other more frequently. During a match in the Royal League in 2005 at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, the meeting was given greater significance than before, this after Danish police, for unclear reasons, handed out blows with batons to Malmö supporters in the stands.

The rivalry with IFK Malmö is both geographical and historical. The two clubs come from the same city and used to play at the same stadium in the early 20th century. The supposed actions of board members of IFK Malmö in 1933, revealing Malmö FF&#x27;s breaches of amateur football rules to the Swedish Football Association, further contribute to the competitive tensions between the two clubs. IFK Malmö have not played in Allsvenskan since 1962; thus matches between the two sides are rare.

===Average attendances===

Malmö FF are well known for their large average attendance. Average attendances at Malmö FF&#x27;s home matches in Allsvenskan and European competitions for the last ten seasons running.


==Stadia==

Malmö FF&#x27;s first stadium was Malmö IP, which was shared with arch-rivals IFK Malmö. The team played here from the founding of the club in 1910, until 1958. The stadium still exists today, albeit with lower capacity, and is now used by women&#x27;s team FC Rosengård, who were previously the women&#x27;s section of Malmö FF. Capacity in 2012 is 7,600, but attendances were usually much higher when Malmö FF played there. For the last season in 1957, the average attendance was 15,500. The club&#x27;s record attendance at Malmö IP is 22,436 against Helsingborgs IF on 1 June 1956. The stadium is still considered a key part of the club&#x27;s history, as it was here that the club were founded, played their first 47 seasons, and won five Swedish championships.

A new stadium was constructed in Malmö after Sweden was awarded the 1958 FIFA World Cup – this saw the birth of Malmö Stadion. Malmö FF played their first season at the stadium in 1958. The first time the club won the Swedish championship at the stadium was in 1965. An upper tier was added to the stadium in 1992. The club enjoyed the most successful era of their history at this stadium, winning ten out of twenty Swedish championships while based there. The stadium originally had a capacity of 30,000 but this was lowered to 27,500 due to changes in safety regulations. The club&#x27;s record attendance at the stadium was 29,328 against Helsingborgs IF on 24 September 1967.

Following the 2004 victory in Allsvenskan, plans were made to construct a new stadium. In July 2005, Malmö FF announced that work was to begin on Eleda Stadion, designed for 18,000 seated spectators and 6,000 standing. The stadium can also accommodate 21,000 as an all-seater for international and European games in which terracing is not allowed. Construction started in 2007 and was finished in 2009. The new stadium is located next to Malmö Stadion. Although there was still small-scale construction going on around the stadium at the time, the stadium was inaugurated on 13 April 2009 with the first home game of the 2009 season against Örgryte IS; Malmö FF&#x27;s Labinot Harbuzi scored the inaugural goal in the 61st minute. The first Swedish championship won at the stadium occurred in 2010, when the club beat Mjällby AIF on 7 November in the final game of the season 2–0. Attendance at this game set the stadium record of 24,148. Stadion is a UEFA category 4 rated stadium.


==European record==
Malmö FF has a rich European legacy with participation in UEFA competitions since 1964. The club&#x27;s best European performance was in the 1978–79 season, when they reached the final of the UEFA Champions League (then European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup), where they were beaten 0–1 by English Champions Nottingham Forest. This makes Malmö FF the only Nordic club to have reached this far in the European Cup or Champions League. Malmö FF is also the only Nordic club to have been represented at the Intercontinental Cup (succeeded by FIFA Club World Cup) in which they competed for the 1979 title. Malmö FF is one of the four Swedish clubs to have participated in the UEFA Champions League group stages, along with IFK Göteborg, AIK, and Helsingborg.

==Ownership and finances==
Malmö FF made the transition from an amateur club to fully professional in the late 1970s under the leadership of club chairman Eric Persson. The club is an open member association, and the annual general meeting is the highest policy-making body where each member has one vote, therefore no shares are issued. The meeting approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and the board, and decides on incoming motions. During the successful 2010&#x27;s era Håkan Jeppsson was the chairman after taking over after Bengt Madsen in 2010, prior to his sudden death in 2018. The club&#x27;s legal status means that any interest claims are made to the club and not to the board of directors or club members. Daily operations are run by a managing director who liaises with the chairman.

With an equity of 497 million SEK the club is the richest football club in Sweden as of 2019. The turnover for 2018 was 343 million SEK. The highest transfer fee received by Malmö FF for a player was 86.2 million SEK (€8.7 million at that time) for Zlatan Ibrahimović who was sold to Ajax in 2001. At the time, this was the highest transfer fee ever paid to a Swedish football club.

The main sponsors of Malmö FF are Volkswagen, Elitfönster AB, Intersport, Imtech, JMS Mediasystem, Mercedes-Benz, SOVA and Svenska Spel. The club also had a naming rights deal with Swedbank regarding the name of Eleda Stadion between 2007 and 2017 when it was called Swedbank Stadion.

==Media coverage==
Malmö FF have been the subject of several films. Some examples are Swedish football documentaries &quot;Blådårar 1&quot; and &quot;Blådårar 2&quot;, which portray the club from both supporter and player perspectives during the 1997 and 2000 seasons. &quot;Blådårar 1&quot; is set in 1997, when the club finished third in Allsvenskan. The film focuses on devoted fan Lasse, player Anders Andersson, former chairman Hans Cavalli-Björkman and other individuals. &quot;Blådårar 2&quot; is set in 2000, the year after the club had been relegated to Superettan, and follows the team as they fight for Malmö FF&#x27;s return to Allsvenskan. The second film continues to follow Lasse, but also has a significant focus on Zlatan Ibrahimović, his progress and how he was eventually sold to AFC Ajax during the 2001 season.

The club have also been featured in &quot;Mitt Hjärtas Malmö&quot;, a series of documentaries covering the history of Malmö. Clips used included match footage from the 1940s (Volume 7), and match footage from the 1979 European Cup Final in Munich from a fan&#x27;s perspective (Volume 8). Volume 9 of the series is devoted entirely to coverage of the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2010.

In the 2005 Swedish drama movie &quot;Om Sara&quot;, actor Alexander Skarsgård plays the fictional football star Kalle Öberg, who plays for Malmö FF.
Finally, a recurring sketch in the second season of the comedy sketch show &quot;Hipphipp!&quot; involved a group of Malmö FF fans singing and chanting while performing everyday tasks, such as shopping or operating an ATM.

<text>Hans Joachim Morgenthau (February 17, 1904 – July 19, 1980) was a German-American jurist and political scientist who was one of the major 20th-century figures in the study of international relations. Morgenthau was born in Coburg, Germany in 1904. Morgenthau&#x27;s works belong to the tradition of realism in international relations theory; he is usually considered among the most influential realists of the post-World War II period. Morgenthau made landmark contributions to international relations theory and the study of international law. His &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot;, first published in 1948, went through five editions during his lifetime and was widely adopted as a textbook in U.S. universities. While Morgenthau emphasized the centrality of power and &quot;the national interest,&quot; the subtitle of &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot;&quot;the struggle for power and peace&quot;indicates his concern not only with the struggle for power but also with the ways in which it is limited by ethical and legal norms.

In addition to his books, Morgenthau wrote widely about international politics and U.S. foreign policy for general-circulation publications such as &quot;The New Leader&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;Worldview&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He knew and corresponded with many of the leading intellectuals and writers of his era, such as Reinhold Niebuhr, George F. Kennan, Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt. At one point in the early Cold War, Morgenthau was a consultant to the U.S. Department of State when Kennan headed its Policy Planning Staff, as well as a second time during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations until he was dismissed by Johnson when he began to publicly criticize American policy in Vietnam. For most of his career, however, Morgenthau was esteemed as an academic interpreter of U.S. foreign policy. 

==Education, career, and personal life==
Morgenthau was born in an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Coburg, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Germany in 1904. After attending the Casimirianum, he continued his education at the Universities of Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. He received his doctorate in 1929 with a thesis entitled &quot;International Jurisdiction: Its Nature and Limits&quot;, and pursued postdoctoral work at the Geneva Graduate Institute, in Switzerland.

He taught and practiced law in Frankfurt before emigrating to the United States in 1937, after several interim years in Switzerland and Spain. One of his first jobs in the U.S. was teaching night school at Brooklyn College. From 1939 to 1943, Morgenthau taught in Kansas City and taught at Keneseth Israel Shalom Congregation there. Morgenthau then was a professor at the University of Chicago until 1973, when he took a professorial chair at the City College of New York. In the early 1950s, Morgenthau was a visiting professor at Harvard, teaching a graduate seminar; at that time he met Henry Kissinger, who was working on his dissertation. 

Morgenthau was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

On moving to New York, Morgenthau separated from his wife, who remained in Chicago partly because of medical issues. He is reported to have tried to initiate plans to start a new relationship while in New York, with Ethel Person (d. 2012), a psychiatrist at Columbia University.

On October 8, 1979, Morgenthau was one of the passengers on board Swissair Flight 316, which crashed while trying to land at Athens-Ellinikon International Airport. The flight had been destined for Bombay and Peking.

Morgenthau died on July 19, 1980, shortly after being admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York with a perforated ulcer. He is buried in the Chabad section of Montefiore Cemetery, in proximity to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, with whom he had a respectful relationship.

==European years and functional jurisprudence==
Morgenthau completed his doctoral dissertation in Germany in the late 1920s. It was published in 1929 as his first book, &quot;The International Administration of Justice, Its Essence and Its Limits&quot;. The book was reviewed by Carl Schmitt, who was then a jurist teaching at the University of Berlin. In an autobiographical essay written near the end of his life, Morgenthau related that, although he had looked forward to meeting Schmitt during a visit to Berlin, the meeting went badly and Morgenthau left thinking that he had been in the presence of (in his own words) &quot;the demonic&quot;. By the late 1920s Schmitt was becoming the leading jurist of the rising Nazi movement in Germany, and Morgenthau came to see their positions as irreconcilable. (The editors of Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; [see below] state that &quot;the reader of [Morgenthau&#x27;s] &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; ... will easily recognize that Morgenthau deplored Schmitt&#x27;s understanding of the political on moral grounds and conceptual grounds.&quot;) 

Following the completion of his doctoral dissertation, Morgenthau left Germany to complete his Habilitation dissertation (license to teach at universities) in Geneva. It was published in French as &quot;La Réalité des normes en particulier des normes du droit international: Fondements d&#x27;une théorie des normes&quot; (The Reality of Norms and in Particular the Norms of International Law: Foundations of a Theory of Norms). It has not been translated into English. The legal scholar Hans Kelsen, who had just arrived in Geneva as a professor, was an adviser to Morgenthau&#x27;s dissertation. Kelsen was among the strongest critics of Carl Schmitt. Kelsen and Morgenthau became lifelong colleagues even after both emigrated from Europe to take academic positions in the United States.
In 1933, Morgenthau published a second book in French, &quot;La notion du &quot;politique&quot;&quot;, which was translated into English and published in 2012 as &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot;. In this book Morgenthau seeks to articulate the difference between legal disputes between nations and political disputes between nations or other litigants. The questions driving the inquiry are: (i) Who holds legal power over the objects or concerns being disputed? (ii) In what manner can the holder of this legal power be changed or held accountable? (iii) How can a dispute, the object of which concerns a legal power, be resolved? and (iv) In what manner will the holder of the legal power be protected in the course of exercising that power? For Morgenthau, the end goal of any legal system in this context is to &quot;ensure justice and peace&quot;.

In his work in the 1920s and 1930s, Morgenthau sought a &quot;functional jurisprudence,&quot; an alternative to mainstream international law. He borrowed ideas from Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, Roscoe Pound, and others. In 1940 Morgenthau set out a research program for legal functionalism in the article &quot;Positivism, Functionalism, and International Law&quot;.
Francis Boyle has written that Morgenthau&#x27;s post-war writings perhaps contributed to a &quot;break between international political science and international legal studies.&quot; However, &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; contains a chapter on international law, and Morgenthau remained an active contributor to the subject of the relationship between international politics and international law until the end of his career.

==American years and political realism==
Hans Morgenthau is considered one of the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the realist school in the 20th century. This school of thought holds that nation-states are the main actors in international relations and that the main concern of the field is the study of power. Morgenthau emphasized the importance of &quot;the national interest,&quot; and in &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; he wrote that &quot;the main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape of international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power.&quot; Morgenthau is sometimes referred to as a classical realist or modern realist in order to differentiate his approach from the structural realism or neo-realism associated with Kenneth Waltz. Recent scholarly assessments of Morgenthau show that his intellectual trajectory was more complicated than originally thought. His realism was infused with moral considerations—though not always acknowledged as such—and during the last part of his life he favored supranational control of nuclear weapons and strongly opposed the U.S. role in the Vietnam War (see below).

===Realism and &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; (1948)===
Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Man versus Power Politics&quot; (1946) argued against an overreliance on science and technology as solutions to political and social problems. The book presented a &quot;pessimistic view of human nature&quot; centered on a universal lust for power and the inevitability of selfishness. &quot;Scientific Man versus Power Politics&quot; also argued that, in Robert Jervis&#x27;s words, &quot;much of modern Liberalism fails to understand the contingent nature of its own knowledge.&quot;

Starting with the second edition of &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot;, Morgenthau included a section in the opening chapter called &quot;Six Principles of Political Realism&quot;.

The principles, paraphrased, are:
# Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature.
# The main signpost of political realism is the concept of interest defined in terms of power, which infuses rational order into the subject matter of politics, and thus makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible. Political realism avoids concerns with the motives and ideology of statesmen. Political realism avoids reinterpreting reality to fit the policy. A good foreign policy minimizes risks and maximizes benefits.
# Realism recognizes that the determining kind of interest varies depending on the political and cultural context in which foreign policy is made. It does not give &quot;interest defined as power&quot; a meaning that is fixed once and for all.
# Political realism is aware of the moral significance of political action. It is also aware of the tension between the moral command and the requirements of successful political action. Realism maintains that universal moral principles must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place, because they cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation.
# Political realism refuses to identify the moral aspirations of a particular nation with the moral laws that govern the universe.
# The political realist maintains the autonomy of the political sphere; the statesman asks &quot;How does this policy affect the power and interests of the nation?&quot; Political realism is based on a pluralistic conception of human nature. The political realist must show where the nation&#x27;s interests differ from the moralistic and legalistic viewpoints.

Morgenthau argued in &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; that skillful diplomacy drawing on these principles could lead to stability via the balance of power. He wrote that &quot;the balance of power and policies aiming at its preservation are not only inevitable, but an essential stabilizing factor in a society of sovereign nations.&quot; (For further discussion, see section on Criticism, below.)
In practice, however, countries &quot;actively engaged in the struggle for power must actually aim not at a balance -- that is, equality -- of power, but at superiority of power in their own behalf,&quot; Morgenthau wrote. The reason is partly that the relative strength of countries can be difficult to calculate, since key elements of national power, such as &quot;the quality of government,&quot; are elusive and frequently change. Because &quot;no nation can foresee how large its miscalculations will turn out to be, all nations must ultimately seek the maximum of power obtainable under the circumstances. Only thus can they hope to attain the maximum margin of safety commensurate with the maximum of errors they might commit.&quot;

===Center for the Study of American Foreign and Military Policy===
In the 1950s, Morgenthau directed the University of Chicago’s Center for the Study of American Foreign and Military Policy. Among other things, he sought to rebuild the center’s resources on “China Studies,” after many experts on the country had been publicly discredited during the Second Red Scare. Morgenthau approached Chinese immigrant and political scientist Tsou Tang to explore the Sino-American relationship using both American and Chinese materials. Morgenthau trusted Tsou, having served on Tsou&#x27;s committees for his master&#x27;s and PhD theses. Tsou&#x27;s 1963 book, &quot;America’s Failure in China, 1941-50&quot;, drew upon his research at the center.

===1955: &quot;Dual state&quot; theory===
In a 1955 article in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, Morgenthau quoted others speaking about a &quot;dual state&quot; existing in the United States: the democratic façade of elected politicians who operate according to the law, and a hidden national security hierarchy and shadow government that operates to monitor and control the former. This has been said to be the origin of the notion of a deep state in the United States.

===Dissent on the Vietnam War===
Morgenthau was a strong supporter of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. When the Eisenhower administration gained the White House, Morgenthau turned his efforts towards a large amount of writing for journals and the press in general. By the time of Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration in 1961, he had become a consultant to the Kennedy administration. After Johnson became president, Morgenthau became much more vocal in his dissent concerning American participation in the Vietnam War, for which he was dismissed as a consultant to the Johnson administration in 1965. Morgenthau sparred with Johnson&#x27;s advisors McGeorge Bundy and Walt Rostow. Morgenthau&#x27;s dissent concerning American involvement in Vietnam, which he viewed mainly as a civil war whose &quot;global significance&quot; was &quot;remote,&quot; brought him considerable public and media attention.

On 21 June 1965, Morgenthau debated Bundy live on television under the title &quot;Vietnam Dialogue: Mr. Bundy and the Professors&quot; with Eric Sevareid as the moderator. During the debate, Bundy accused Morgenthau of being a defeatist and pessimist, citing his 1961 statement that the Pathet Lao were destined to win the Lao civil war, leading Morgenthau to reply: &quot;I may have been dead wrong on Laos, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I am dead wrong on Vietnam.&quot; Bundy then brought up a statement Morgenthau made in 1956, praising President Diem of South Vietnam for creating a &quot;miracle.&quot; The American journalist A.J. Langguth wrote that Bundy&#x27;s point was irrelevant as Diem had been assassinated in 1963, but Bundy made it sound as if Morgenthau was opportunistic and inconsistent. Bundy was generally regarded as having won the debate by viewers at the time.

In these years Morgenthau continued to write prolifically, publishing a three-volume collection of his essays in 1962.

===American years after 1965===
Starting in 1960, Morgenthau became increasingly concerned with the revolutionary implications of nuclear weapons and the possibility of nuclear war, which he maintained would be a moral calamity of an unprecedented kind. He remarked in the journal &quot;Christianity and Crisis&quot; that &quot;no such radical qualitative transformation of the structure of international relations has ever occurred in history.&quot; While in the 1950s and earlier, Morgenthau had tended to emphasize, in William Scheuerman&#x27;s words, &quot;the continuities of human history,&quot; his recognition of the radical novelty of nuclear weapons led, from the early 1960s onward, to a stress on discontinuity, as represented by the possibility of a civilization-ending nuclear conflict. Morgenthau&#x27;s views on this issue were influenced by Karl Jaspers&#x27; &quot;The Future of Mankind,&quot; which he reviewed in 1961 for &quot;Saturday Review&quot;.

After 1965, Morgenthau became a leading voice in the discussion of just war theory in the modern nuclear era. Just war theory was further developed in the work of Paul Ramsey, Michael Walzer, Jeff McMahan, and other scholars.

Morgenthau&#x27;s book &quot;Truth and Power,&quot; published in 1970, collected his essays from the previous decade dealing with both foreign policy, including Vietnam, and U.S. domestic politics, e.g. the civil rights movement. Morgenthau dedicated the book to Hans Kelsen, &quot;who has taught us through his example how to speak Truth to Power.&quot; Morgenthau&#x27;s last major book, &quot;Science: Servant or Master,&quot; was dedicated to his colleague Reinhold Niebuhr and published in 1972.

In summer 1978, Morgenthau wrote his last co-authored essay titled &quot;The Roots of Narcissism,&quot; with Ethel Person of Columbia University. This essay was a continuation of Morgenthau&#x27;s earlier study of this subject in his 1962 essay &quot;Public Affairs: Love and Power,&quot; where Morgenthau engaged some of the themes that Niebuhr and the theologian Paul Tillich were addressing. Morgenthau admired Tillich&#x27;s book &quot;Love, Power and Justice,&quot; and he wrote a second essay related to the book&#x27;s themes. More recently, Anthony Lang has recovered and published Morgenthau&#x27;s extensive course notes on Aristotle (for a course Morgenthau taught while at the New School for Social Research during his New York years). The comparison of Morgenthau to Aristotle has been further explored by Molloy.

Morgenthau was a tireless reviewer of books during the several decades of his career as a scholar in the United States. He wrote nearly a hundred book reviews, including almost three dozen for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; alone. Morgenthau&#x27;s last two book reviews were not written for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and were of the books &quot;Soviet Perspectives on International Relations, 1956–1967&quot;, by William Zimmerman and &quot;Work, Society and Culture&quot; by Yves Simon. The last book review Morgenthau wrote for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; appeared in 1971. Morgenthau&#x27;s first book review, written in 1940, was of &quot;Law, the State, and the International Community&quot;, by James Brown Scott. Morgenthau also commented on the Pentagon Papers.

Like Hannah Arendt, Morgenthau dedicated time and effort to the support of the state of Israel. Both Morgenthau and Arendt made annual trips to Israel to lend their established academic voices to its still young and growing academic community during its inaugural decades as a new nation. Morgenthau&#x27;s interest in Israel also extended to the Middle East more generally, including the politics of oil. Morgenthau&#x27;s interest in Israel extended further to related issues of geopolitics, and issues related to Andrei Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

Morgenthau remained throughout the Cold War an active participant in the discussion of U.S. foreign policy. He wrote in this connection about Henry Kissinger and his role in the Nixon administration. In a 1975 essay, Morgenthau criticized Kissinger&#x27;s approach toward internal upheaval in the Third World, arguing that the root of &quot;instability&quot; was not &quot;Communist subversion&quot; but popular dissatisfaction with the status quo. A foreign policy that failed to recognize this could lead to the support of &quot;tyranny,&quot; Morgenthau wrote: &quot;[I]n an essentially unstable world, tyranny becomes the last resort of a policy committed to stability in the last resort.&quot; Morgenthau in 1977 also wrote a brief &quot;Foreword&quot; on the theme of terrorism as it began to emerge in the 1970s. In addition to addressing current political issues, Morgenthau also wrote about the philosophy of democratic theory when faced with situations of crisis or tension.

==Criticism==
The reception of Morgenthau&#x27;s work can be divided into three phases. The first phase occurred during Morgenthau&#x27;s life up to his death in 1980. The second phase was between 1980 and the one hundred year commemoration of his birth that took place in 2004. The third phase of the reception of his writings is between the centenary commemoration and the present, which shows a vibrant discussion of his continuing influence.

===Criticism during European years===
In Morgenthau&#x27;s early career, the book review of his dissertation by Carl Schmitt had a lasting and negative effect on Morgenthau. Schmitt had become a leading juristic voice for the rising Nazi movement in Germany, and Morgenthau came to see their positions as irreconcilable, although it has been argued that Schmitt and Morgenthau engaged in a &quot;hidden dialogue&quot; in which they influenced each other. Morgenthau subsequently met Hans Kelsen at Geneva while a student, and Kelsen&#x27;s treatment of Morgenthau&#x27;s writings left a lifelong positive impression upon the young Morgenthau. Kelsen in the 1920s had emerged as Schmitt&#x27;s most thorough critic and had earned a reputation as a leading international critic of the then rising National Socialist movement in Germany, which matched Morgenthau&#x27;s own negative opinion of Nazism.

===Criticism during American years===
While Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;Politics Among Nations&quot; had a large influence on a generation of scholars in global politics and international law, Morgenthau&#x27;s views did not go unchallenged. On the one hand, some critics rejected the basic premises of Morgenthau&#x27;s realist perspective. On the other hand, some theorists working within a realist framework, such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, took issue with aspects of Morgenthau&#x27;s approach even while sharing some of his basic assumptions.

In his &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; (1979), Kenneth Waltz urged more attention to purely &quot;structural&quot; elements of the international system, especially the distribution of capabilities among states. Waltz&#x27;s neorealism was more self-consciously scientific than Morgenthau&#x27;s version of realism. Waltz argued that balances of power recurrently form whether or not states intend that result. Waltz criticized Morgenthau for seeing the maintenance of a balance of power as dependent on states&#x27; motives and conscious aims, leading to what Waltz called a &quot;distortion&quot; of balance-of-power theory.

In contrast to Waltz&#x27;s &quot;defensive&quot; realism, John Mearsheimer presented a theory of &quot;offensive realism&quot; in &quot;The Tragedy of Great Power Politics&quot; (2001). Mearsheimer agreed with Morgenthau that states seek to maximize their relative power but disagreed about the cause: whereas Morgenthau posited, in Mearsheimer&#x27;s words, &quot;a will to power inherent in every state,&quot; Mearsheimer argued that the &quot;anarchical&quot; character of the international system pushes states to acquire as much power as possible to maximize their chances of survival.

Another area of criticism concerned Morgenthau&#x27;s treatment of the concept of the national interest. One scholar has suggested that Morgenthau erred in thinking that &quot;the &#x27;rational core of the national interest&#x27; can be ascertained by objective analysis.&quot; On this account, &quot;the concept of the national interest simply cannot bear the weight Morgenthau assigned to it.&quot;

Morgenthau&#x27;s concept of politics itself has been seen, at least by some writers, as a firmer basis for his position. While Morgenthau viewed politics as a struggle for power, he also viewed it as a struggle conducted by specific means and within certain limits. From this perspective, Morgenthau&#x27;s distinction between political power and military power represented an effort &quot;to insulate&quot; the properly political realm &quot;from the intrusion of physical violence and domination.&quot;

The conceptual distinction between political and military power may not always have influenced Morgenthau&#x27;s views on specific policy issues, but it probably did so in the case of nuclear weapons. His concern with nuclear weapons and the arms race led to discussions and debates with Henry Kissinger and others. Morgenthau saw many aspects of the nuclear arms race as a form of irrationality requiring the attention of responsible diplomats, statesmen, and scholars. However, Morgenthau&#x27;s view that a world state would be required to solve the problem of nuclear weapons is in tension with the skepticism about global governance that his realist perspective implies.

===Criticism of Morgenthau&#x27;s legacy===

Christoph Frei&#x27;s intellectual biography of Morgenthau, published in English translation in 2001 (from the earlier German edition) was one of the first of many substantial publications about Morgenthau in the 2000s. Christoph Rohde published a biography of Morgenthau in 2004, still available only in German. Also around 2004, commemorative volumes were published on the occasion of the centenary of Morgenthau&#x27;s birth.

John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago has contrasted Morgenthau&#x27;s political realism to the neo-conservativism prevailing during the Bush administration in the context of the 2003 Iraq War. Morgenthau saw the ethical and moral component of international politics as an integral part of the reasoning process of the international statesman and the essential content of responsible scholarship in international relations. Scholars continue to explore various aspects of Morgenthau&#x27;s thought, as well as his place in relation to twentieth-century intellectual currents and the disciplinary history of political science and international relations.

<text>Agustín García Calvo (October 15, 1926 – November 1, 2012) was a Spanish philologist, philosopher, poet, and playwright.

== Biography ==
García Calvo was born and died in Zamora. He read Classical Philology at Salamanca University, being one of the first students of Spanish philologist Antonio Tovar. He concluded his doctoral dissertation on Ancient prosody and metrics in Madrid at the age of 22. In 1951, he worked as a grammar-school teacher. In 1953 he was appointed to a university chair of Classical Languages in Seville, and he occupied a second chair at Madrid&#x27;s Universidad Complutense (then called &quot;Central University of Madrid&quot;) from 1964 to 1965. In 1965 the Franco administration expelled him from his Madrid chair, along with Enrique Tierno Galván, José Luis López Aranguren and Santiago Montero Díaz, because they had given support to student protests against the fascist government. José María Valverde and Antonio Tovar resigned from their university chairs as a sign of protest against this reprisal. García Calvo spent many years of his subsequent exile in Paris, being appointed professor at Lille University and at the Collège de France. He also worked as a translator for the exiled Spanish publishing house Ruedo Ibérico. In the French capital he organized a regular circle of political discussion in one of the cafés of the Latin Quarter. In 1976, following the death of General Franco, he recovered his chair in Madrid, where he remained teaching ancient philology until his retirement in 1992. He was emeritus professor at the &quot;Universidad Complutense&quot; until 1997 and remained active as a lecturer, writer and columnist until his death in 2012.

== Political thought ==

In his written works and public statements, García Calvo attempted to give voice to an anonymous popular sentiment that rejects the intrigues of Power. An essential part of this struggle consists in denouncing Reality - an idea that appears to be a true reflection of &quot;what there is&quot;, while in fact it is an abstract construction in which things are reduced by force to the status of mere ideas. In this process of reduction all unpredictable and undefined aspects that may be found in things are destroyed, thus facilitating their subjection to all kinds of plots, schemes and intrigues. People - just another case of a &quot;thing&quot; - are in this way organized into individuals, subject to a double and contradictory requirement, which is that each of them has to be the one he is, and yet all of them have to constitute a mass of many. Fortunately this kind of social organization always leads to flaws and imperfections, and it is just these unpredictable impulses, inaccessible to planning and calculation, to which García Calvo refers when he speaks of &quot;the people&quot;.

The ever-increasing sophistication of Power arrives at its pinnacle in democratic societies that are composed of masses of individuals. Given that the &quot;scheme of progress&quot; consists in imposing this democratic system in all parts of the world, popular struggle has to be directed against democracy itself, being this the kind of political régime that administers death to the people in the most advanced societies. The simultaneous survival of comparatively old-fashioned systems of domination (for example, communist dictatorships and some forms of religious rule in Arab countries) is only meant to legitimate democracy through a rhetoric of &quot;unfavourable comparison&quot; and must therefore be considered a &quot;cheat&quot;.

An essential ingredient of the maintenance of Power and Reality is God, a personage who has assumed many different names (such as the name of &quot;Man&quot;) in the past, but in his most advanced and sophisticated form presents himself under the name of &quot;Money&quot; - a ubiquitous idea to which everything can be reduced, since everything has a cost or value. The religion in which this new God is worshipped is Science - a religion whose most important mission is to keep the idea of Reality up-to-date and to convince individuals that everything is under control.

In democracy, State and Capital are only two manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon. Popular struggle must be directed against both, without ever claiming a &quot;right&quot; to anything (as this would imply an acknowledgement of the legitimacy of Power) or proposing alternative forms of government (as this would only contribute to the further advance of Power). This popular struggle is not an individual struggle (since the individual, created after the image of the State, is essentially a reactionary entity and must be conceived as the people&#x27;s most important adversary), but rather &quot;the people&#x27;s struggle&quot; - a struggle that originates in what remains in us of &quot;the people&quot;, beneath all our individual features and in open contradiction with these.

Speech or language plays an important role in oppressing the people, but also in their rebellion. Those words that have signification in each of the world&#x27;s languages constitute a Reality that happens to be different in each tribe. Insofar as language helps create the illusion that we know everything there is and that we know how to call it and how to manipulate it, language is a weapon directed against the people. On the other hand we continuously see conjectures or glimpses arise in the common use of language that point to the opposite conclusion (that we do not know what there is and that Reality does not reach so far as to include everything that occurs), and in this sense language, something that anyone can use although no-one can possess it, also constitutes the people&#x27;s self-expression &quot;par excellence&quot;.

Specific examples of what this struggle against Reality may look like can be found (1) in García Calvo&#x27;s attacks on the car (the individual vehicle) and his activism in defence of the train, (2) in the struggle against the idea that &quot;we all together form public finance&quot; and (3) in the decision to use the same style in writing as in oral communication, as opposed to the pedantic use of language that we know from academic scholars, civil servants and newspaper journalists.

<doc id="691962" wikidata="Q1495753" url="?curid=691962" title="Lupus of Sens">
<text>Saint Lupus of Sens (or Saint Loup de Sens) (born c. 573; died c. 623) was the nineteenth bishop of Sens.

==Life==
He was the son of Betton, Count of Tonnerre, &quot;Blessed Betto,&quot; a member of the royal house of the Kingdom of Burgundy.
He distinguished himself by his tact and firmness in dealing with the rival Merovingian Princes of his time. 

==Church in Saint-Loup-de-Naud==

The Romanesque church dedicated to Saint Loup at Naud, 8 km from Provins in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious iconographic program in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the Trinity. About 980, Sevinus, archbishop of Sens, made a gift to the Benedictine community of the abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif at Sens of four altars &quot;in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum&quot;—&quot;in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup&quot;—betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention Saint-Loup-de-Naud among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the counts of Champagne and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community&#x27;s dismay; the sculpted &quot;portail&quot; with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at Chartres was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when pilgrimages brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War and again by the Huguenots in 1567, during the French Wars of Religion.

<doc id="691968" wikidata="Q1409242" url="?curid=691968" title="Oily fish">
<text>Oily fish are fish species with oil (fats) in soft tissues and in the coelomic cavity around the gut. Their fillets may contain up to 30% oil, although this figure varies both within and between species. Examples of oily fish include small forage fish such as sardines, herring and anchovies, and other larger pelagic fish such as salmon, trout, tuna, swordfish and mackerel.

Oily fish can be contrasted with whitefish, which contain oil only in the liver and in much less overall quantity than oily fish. Examples of whitefish are cod, haddock and flatfish. White fish are usually demersal fish which live on or near the seafloor, whereas oily fish are pelagic, living in the water column goes from the bottom.

Oily fish meat is a good source of important fat-soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A and D, and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids (white fish also contain these nutrients but at a much lower concentration). For this reason the consumption of oily fish rather than white fish can be more beneficial to humans, particularly concerning heart diseases such as stroke and ischemic heart disease; however, oily fish are known to carry higher levels of contaminants (such as mercury or dioxin or POPs) than whitefish. Among other benefits, studies suggest that the omega-3 fatty acids in oily fish may help improve inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.

== Health benefits ==
=== Dementia ===
A 1997 study published in &quot;Annals of Neurology&quot; followed 5,386 elderly participants in Rotterdam. It found that fish consumption decreased the risk of dementia. However, the 2.1-year average follow-up was less than the three years dementia commonly affects people prior to diagnosis. Thus, the study was unclear as to whether fish consumption protected against dementia, or if dementia prevented the participants from wanting more fish.

French research published in 2002 in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; (BMJ) followed 1,674 elderly residents of southern France for seven years, studying their consumption of meat versus seafood and the presence of dementia symptoms. The conclusion was that people who ate fish at least once a week had a significantly lower risk of being diagnosed with dementia over a seven-year period. This study reinforced the Annals of Neurology findings. Because of the longer term, the BMJ study provided stronger evidence of a genuine protective effect. There was a possible confounding factor in that individuals with higher education have both a lower risk of dementia and higher consumption of fish.

=== Cardiovascular health ===

Consuming 200–400 g of oily fish twice per week may also help prevent sudden death due to myocardial infarction by preventing cardiac arrhythmia. The eicosapentaenoic acid found in fish oils appears to dramatically reduce inflammation through conversion within the body to resolvins, with beneficial effects for the cardiovascular system and arthritis.

== Recommended consumption ==
In 1994, the UK Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy recommended that people eat at least two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish.

In 2004 the UK Food Standards Agency published advice on the recommended minimum and maximum quantities of oily fish to be eaten per week, to balance the beneficial qualities of the omega-3 fatty acids against the potential dangers of ingesting polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. It reiterated the 1994 guideline of two portions of fish per week including one portion of oily fish, but advised eating no more than four portions per week, and no more than two portions for people who are pregnant, may become pregnant or who are breastfeeding.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) Exposure Reference Dose (RfI) for methylmercury (MeHg) is 0.1 micrograms per kg body weight per day. The corresponding limit of blood mercury is 5.8 micrograms per liter. The restrictions apply to certain oily fish – &quot;marlin, swordfish, shark and, to a lesser extent, tuna&quot;. The recommendations on maximum consumption of oily fish were up to four portions (1 portion = 140g, or approx 4.9 ounces) a week for men, boys, and women past childbearing age, and up to two portions a week for women of childbearing age, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, and girls. There is no recommended limit on the consumption of white fish.

The EPA and 2007 U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines sets a limit only on consumption of fatty fish with greater than one part per million of methylmercury, specifically tilefish, king mackerel, shark and swordfish. There are limits, however, for nursing/pregnant women and children under the age of six. This population should completely avoid fish with high risk of mercury contamination (those listed above) and limit consumption of moderate and low-mercury fish to 12 ounces or less per week. Albacore tuna should be limited to six ounces or less per week. 

== Omega-3 content ==

Concerns about contamination, diet or supply have led to investigation of plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, notably flax, hempseed and perilla oils. Lactating women who supplemented their diet with flaxseed oil showed increases in blood and breastmilk concentration of alpha-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid but no changes to concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid.

<text>Comet 87P/Bus is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 6.5 years. It fits the definition of an Encke-type comet with (TJupiter &gt; 3; a &lt; aJupiter). It was discovered by Schelte J. Bus in 1981 on a plate taken with the 1.2m UK Schmidt telescope at Siding Spring, Australia. The discovery was announced in IAU Circular 3578 on March 4, 1981. It has been observed on each of its subsequent apparitions, most recently in 2020.

Its nucleus is estimated to have an effective radius of 0.27 ± 0.01 kilometers and to be elongated, with an a/b ratio greater than 2.2. Its rotational period is estimated to be 32 ± 9 hours.

A close approach to Jupiter on 13 May 1952, at a distance of 0.0668 AU, lowered the orbital period from 12.46 years and the perihelion distance from 4.43 AU to 6.43 years and 2.13 AU respectively. Another close approach to Jupiter on 24 February 2023, at a distance of 0.182 AU, raised the perihelion to 3.62 AU and the orbital period to 9.58 years.

<text>Geoffrey Durham (born 22 July 1949) is a British comedy magician and actor who was known for many years as &quot;the Great Soprendo&quot;.

==Early life==

Durham was born in East Molesey, Surrey, England. At the age of ten, he developed an interest in magic and performed occasional shows for friends and relatives. By the age of 13, however, that interest had waned. He later studied Spanish at Leeds University and then took a job as a stage-hand at the Leeds City Varieties Theatre. He worked there for 18 months, ending up as head flyman, and then left to become an actor.

After working in various stage shows for several years his interest in magic was rekindled while preparing for a show in Liverpool, in which his character performed some tricks. He dug out some of his old props and found he enjoyed learning and performing magic so much that he decided to make it his new career.

==Magic career==
Durham presented a magic act as an outrageous Spanish magician for at least 15 years before performing as himself. As &#x27;The Great Soprendo&#x27;, Durham appeared in many children&#x27;s TV shows, including &quot;Crackerjack&quot;, and appeared in theatres all over the country. His catchphrase was &quot;Piff Paff Poof!&quot;

After ditching his disguise as the Great Soprendo, Durham has had continued success in his own right. He was a regular contributor to the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;, and his &quot;Newspaper Tear&quot; featured on the &quot;50 Greatest Magic Tricks&quot; on the same channel. He occasionally appeared as one of the &quot;Puzzle Panel&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

Durham acted as magic consultant on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot; in 1988. He coached Sylvester McCoy in magic for the scenes in Part Four, in which the Doctor performs a magic show in the Dark Circus to appease the Gods of Ragnarok. Durham received an on-screen credit for his work.

Durham is a member of the Inner Magic Circle, and was presented with the Maskelyne Award in 2002. Durham had previously refused to join the Magic Circle because membership was only open to men, and was instead a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians.

Durham appeared in the 1987 film &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, which starred Emily Lloyd and Tom Bell.

==Personal life==
Durham married the writer and comedian Victoria Wood in March 1980, but they separated in October 2002 and were later divorced. The couple had a daughter, Grace, and a son, Henry. Durham remarried in December 2014.

In 1994, Durham went to a Quaker meeting and became a member of the Society of Friends two years later. He has described his life with Quakers as &quot;the single most inspiring, moving and rewarding thread running through the whole of my adult life&quot;. He was involved for many years with the Quaker outreach programme &quot;Quaker Quest&quot;, and he remains a regular speaker at Quaker events. He has written &quot;The Spirit of the Quakers&quot; and &quot;Being a Quaker: A Guide for Newcomers&quot;.

<doc id="691986" wikidata="Q5255534" url="?curid=691986" title="Democrat and Chronicle">
<text>The Democrat and Chronicle is a daily newspaper serving the greater Rochester, New York, area. Headquartered at 245 East Main Street in downtown Rochester, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; operates under the ownership of Gannett. The paper&#x27;s production facility is in Rockaway, New Jersey. Since the &quot;Times-Union&quot; merger in 1997, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; is Rochester&#x27;s only daily circulated newspaper.

==History==
Founded in 1833 as &quot;The Balance&quot;, the paper eventually became known as the &quot;Daily Democrat&quot;. The &quot;Daily Democrat&quot; merged with another local paper, the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, in 1870, to become known as the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;. The paper was purchased by Gannett in 1928. Prior to 1959, the newspaper was headquartered at 59-61 E. Main Street, on Rochester&#x27;s Main Street Bridge.

From 1928 to 1985, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; was Gannett&#x27;s flagship paper. In 1959, the newspaper relocated to Gannett&#x27;s headquarters in the Gannett Building at 55 Exchange Boulevard. It shared the space with the &quot;Rochester Times-Union&quot;, an afternoon daily paper. Gannett moved its headquarters to Tysons Corner, Virginia, home of USA Today, in 1985. Over time, Gannett merged the &quot;Times-Union&quot; into the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;. Their staffs were merged in 1992, and the &quot;Times-Union&quot; circulation ended in 1997. That same year, newspaper production was relocated from the Gannett Building to a facility in Greece, New York.
In May 2016, the &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; relocated its headquarters to a new, smaller building at the Midtown Plaza site on East Main Street. At 153,350 square feet, the former headquarters in the Gannett building was considerably larger than the current headquarters, which is 42,000 square feet. The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; no longer needed the much larger space in the building, which included the area that formerly held the printing presses before 1996, which was expensive to maintain.

With the move came new branding as &quot;D&amp;C Digital&quot;, emphasizing focus on the outlet&#x27;s digital marketing services and video properties.

In 2010, The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; ranked number one among US newspapers in market penetration, the percentage of readers in a metro area who read in print or online. The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot; held that top spot for several years, and have been among the leaders since the 1990s.

In 2023, the paper announced it would relocate its printing offices from Greece, New York to Rockaway, New Jersey that April.

=== Sexual abuse scandal ===

The &quot;Democrat and Chronicle&quot;, along with its parent company Gannett, was sued in October 2019 by a former paperboy who accused the newspaper of enabling a former district manager to sexually abuse him in the 1980s. In late 2018, this former paperboy emailed investigative reporters and Gannett management, asking them to investigate his claims. Karen Magnuson, then Executive Editor for Gannett&#x27;s Democrat &amp; Chronicle, told reporters to put their investigative reporting of abuse claims on &quot;pause&quot; and brought the email to the attention of Gannett&#x27;s management to conduct their own investigation. Gannett COO Michael G. Kane then sent the original claimant a letter indicating no evidence had been found and they were &quot;closing out&quot; the matter. Shortly after, New York passed its Child Victim Act, lifting the statute of limitations on child sex abuse claims. This initial case is currently pending. Four more lawsuits were filed in early 2020. Additionally, three more men filed suit against Gannett for child sex abuse in September 2020. As the New York state window to file under its Childs Victim Act closed in August 2021, a ninth man sued the Democrat and Chronicle, and its publisher Gannett, in Rochester NY alleging child sex abuse by the same former district manager of paper carriers. In July 2022, Gannett defense attorneys notified the court of their intent to file a motion to have the former paperboy&#x27;s Child Victims Act cases taken &quot;out of the state court system and turn them over to the New York Workers&#x27; Compensation Board&quot; stating that the 11-14-year-old paperboys should have applied for workman&#x27;s compensation at the time of their injuries in the 1980s, or in 2019 upon enactment of the CVA as it is a simple online process. All these cases are currently pending in New York State court.

Nearly three years after the first lawsuit filing, in July 2022, Gannett (the parent company and publisher of the Democrat &amp; Chronicle) defense attorneys notified the court of their intent to file a motion to have the former paperboys&#x27; Child Victims Act cases taken &quot;out of the state court system and turn them over to the New York Workers&#x27; Compensation Board&quot; stating that the 11–14-year-old paperboys should have applied for workman&#x27;s compensation at the time of their injuries in the 1980s or upon enactment of the CVA in 2019. In December 2022, presiding Judge, Deborah A. Chimes acquiesced to Gannett&#x27;s demands that NY Workers Compensation Board – despite the existence of the Child Victims Act as NY State law – determine if Plaintiffs have a valid cause of action for damages or whether they are limited to benefits under the Worker’s Compensation Law. This despite the fact that the Workers Compensation Board has no mechanism to consider this question of justice and legal rights, as the Board is tasked by the state of New York solely to: &quot;administer workers’ compensation, disability benefits and Paid Family Leave.&quot; On July 26, 2024, this demand of Gannett, received and accepted fully by Judge Deborah Chimes, was reversed, by the Fourth Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court. The nine plaintiff cases remain pending action by Judge Chimes and her court.

<text>Marculf (in French &quot;Marcoult&quot;, &quot;Marcouf&quot;, &quot;Marcoul&quot; or &quot;Marcou&quot;) (d. 558) was the abbot at Nantus in the Cotentin. He is regarded as a saint and is associated with the healing of scrofula.

==Life==
Marculf was born in the Saxon colony of Bayeux around AD 500. The accounts of his life are merged with that of Saint Helier, whom he sent to convert the inhabitants of Jersey to Christianity. Marcouf also visited Jersey himself, where miracles are ascribed to him.

He died on May 1, 558, in the Îles Saint-Marcouf off the east coast of the Cotentin Peninsula. His relics were transferred to the abbey of Corbény in Champagne, where they played a part in the coronation ceremonies of kings of France, crowned at Reims, and in the tradition of the royal touch.

The traditional power ascribed to French and English kings to cure scrofula (the king&#x27;s Evil) by the laying on of hands derives from the of the relics of Marcouf, according to the chronicle of Joan of Arc, &quot;Chronique de la Pucelle&quot;.

The north ambulatory of the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Coutances contains the Chapel of Saint Marcouf, with a stained glass window showing scenes from the saint&#x27;s life.

<doc id="692003" wikidata="Q27203" url="?curid=692003" title="Kibble balance">
<text>A Kibble balance (also formerly known as a watt balance) is an electromechanical measuring instrument that measures the weight of a test object very precisely by the electric current and voltage needed to produce a compensating force. It is a metrological instrument that can realize the definition of the kilogram unit of mass based on fundamental constants.

It was originally known as a watt balance because the weight of the test mass is proportional to the product of current and voltage, which is measured in watts. In June 2016, two months after the death of its inventor, Bryan Kibble, metrologists of the Consultative Committee for Units of the International Committee for Weights and Measures agreed to rename the device in his honor.

Prior to 2019, the definition of the kilogram was based on a physical object known as the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK).
After considering alternatives, in 2013 the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) agreed on accuracy criteria for replacing this definition with one based on the use of a Kibble balance. After these criteria had been achieved, the CGPM voted unanimously on November 16, 2018, to change the definition of the kilogram and several other units, effective May 20, 2019, to coincide with World Metrology Day. There is also a method called the joule balance. All methods that use the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant are sometimes called the Planck balance.

== Design ==
The Kibble balance is a more accurate version of the ampere balance, an early current measuring instrument in which the force between two current-carrying coils of wire is measured and then used to calculate the magnitude of the current. The Kibble balance operates in the opposite sense; the current in the coils set very precisely by the Planck constant, and the force between the coils is used to measure the weight of a test kilogram mass. Then the mass is calculated from the weight by accurately measuring the local Earth&#x27;s gravity (the net acceleration combining gravitational and centrifugal effects) with a gravimeter. Thus the mass of the object is defined in terms of a current and a voltage— allowing the device to &quot;measure mass without recourse to the IPK (International Prototype Kilogram) or any physical object&quot;.

== Origin ==
The principle that is used in the Kibble balance was proposed by Bryan Kibble (1938-2016) of the UK National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in 1975 for measurement of the gyromagnetic ratio. In 1978 the Mark I watt balance was built at the NPL with Ian Robinson and Ray Smith. It operated until 1988.

The main weakness of the ampere balance method is that the result depends on the accuracy with which the dimensions of the coils are measured. The Kibble balance uses an extra calibration step to cancel the effect of the geometry of the coils, removing the main source of uncertainty. This extra step involves moving the force coil through a known magnetic flux at a known speed. This was possible by setting of the conventional values of the von Klitzing constant and Josephson constant, which are used throughout the world for voltage and resistance calibration. Using these principles, in 1990 Bryan Kibble and Ian Robinson invented the Kibble Mark II balance, which uses a circular coil and operates in vacuum conditions . Bryan Kibble worked with Ian Robinson and Janet Belliss to build this Mark Two version of the balance. This design allowed for measurements accurate enough for use in the redefinition of the SI unit of mass: the kilogram.

The Kibble balance originating from the National Physical Laboratory was transferred to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) in 2009, where scientists from the two labs continued to refine the instrument.
In 2014, NRC researchers published the most accurate measurement of the Planck constant at that time, with a relative uncertainty of 1.8. A final paper by NRC researchers was published in May 2017, presenting a measurement of the Planck constant with an uncertainty of only 9.1 parts per billion, the measurement with the least uncertainty to that date. Other Kibble balance experiments are conducted in the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology (METAS) in Berne, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) near Paris and Laboratoire national de métrologie et d’essais (LNE) in Trappes, France.

== Principle ==
A conducting wire of length formula_1 that carries an electric current formula_2 perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength formula_3 experiences a Lorentz force equal to the product of these variables. In the Kibble balance, the current is varied so that this force counteracts the weight formula_4 of a mass formula_5 to be measured. This principle is derived from the ampere balance. formula_4 is given by the mass formula_5 multiplied by the local gravitational acceleration formula_8. Thus,
: formula_9 
The Kibble balance avoids the problems of measuring formula_3 and formula_1 in a second calibration step. The same wire (in practice, a coil) is moved through the same magnetic field at a known speed formula_12. By Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, a potential difference formula_13 is generated across the ends of the wire, which equals formula_14. Thus 
: formula_15 
The unknown product formula_16 can be eliminated from the equations to give
: formula_17
: formula_18
With formula_13, formula_2, formula_8, and formula_12 accurately measured, this gives an accurate value for formula_5. 
Both sides of the equation have the dimensions of power, measured in watts in the International System of Units; hence the original name &quot;watt balance&quot;. The product formula_16, also called the geometric factor, is not trivially equal in both calibration steps. The geometric factor is only constant under certain stability conditions on the coil.

== Implementation ==
The Kibble balance is constructed so that the mass to be measured and the wire coil are suspended from one side of a balance scale, with a counterbalance mass on the other side. The system operates by alternating between two modes: &quot;weighing&quot; and &quot;moving&quot;. The entire mechanical subsystem operates in a vacuum chamber to remove the effects of air buoyancy.

While &quot;weighing&quot;, the system measures formula_2. The system controls the current in the coil to keep the electromagnetic force on the coil balanced with the force of gravity. Coil position and velocity measurement circuitry uses an interferometer together with a precision clock input to determine the velocity and control the current needed to maintain it. The required current is measured, using an ammeter comprising a Josephson junction voltage standard and an integrating voltmeter.

While &quot;moving&quot;, the system measures formula_13 and formula_12. The system ceases to provide current to the coil. This allows the counterbalance to pull the coil (and mass) upward through the magnetic field, which causes a voltage difference across the coil. The velocity measurement circuitry measures the speed formula_12 of movement of the coil. This voltage is measured, using the same voltage standard and integrating voltmeter.

A typical Kibble balance measures formula_13, formula_2, and formula_12, but does not measure the local gravitational acceleration formula_8, because formula_8 does not vary rapidly with time. Instead, formula_8 is measured in the same laboratory using a highly accurate and precise gravimeter. In addition, the balance depends on a highly accurate and precise frequency reference such as an atomic clock to compute voltage and current. Thus, the precision and accuracy of the mass measurement depends on the Kibble balance, the gravimeter, and the clock.

Like the early atomic clocks, the early Kibble balances were one-of-a-kind experimental devices and were large, expensive, and delicate. As of 2019, work is underway to produce standardized devices at prices that permit use in any metrology laboratory that requires high-precision measurement of mass.

As well as large Kibble balances, microfabricated or MEMS watt balances (now called Kibble balances) have been demonstrated since around 2003. These are fabricated on single silicon dies similar to those used in microelectronics and accelerometers, and are capable of measuring small forces in the nanonewton to micronewton range traceably to the SI-defined physical constants via electrical and optical measurements. Due to their small scale, MEMS Kibble balances typically use electrostatic rather than the inductive forces used in larger instruments. Lateral and torsional variants have also been demonstrated, with the main application (as of 2019) being in the calibration of the atomic force microscope. Accurate measurements by several teams will enable their results to be averaged and so reduce the experimental error.

== Measurements ==

Accurate measurements of electric current and potential difference are made in conventional electrical units (rather than SI units), which are based on fixed &quot;conventional values&quot; of the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant, formula_35 and formula_36 respectively. The current Kibble balance experiments are equivalent to measuring the value of the conventional watt in SI units. From the definition of the conventional watt, this is equivalent to measuring the value of the product formula_37 in SI units instead of its fixed value in conventional electrical units:
: formula_38
The importance of such measurements is that they are also a direct measurement of the Planck constant formula_39:
: formula_40

The principle of the electronic kilogram relies on the value of the Planck constant, which is as of 2019 an exact value. This is similar to the metre being defined by the speed of light. With the constant defined exactly, the Kibble balance is not an instrument to measure the Planck constant, but is instead an instrument to measure mass:
: formula_41

== Effect of gravity ==
Gravity and the nature of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local gravitational acceleration &quot;g&quot;, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, &quot;g&quot; varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth&#x27;s surface the measurement is made (see &quot;Earth&#x27;s gravity&quot;). There are also slight seasonal variations in &quot;g&quot; at a location due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth&#x27;s shape (earth tide and polar motion) caused by the Moon and the Sun. Although &quot;g&quot; is not a term in the &quot;definition&quot; of the kilogram, it is crucial in the process of measurement of the kilogram when relating energy to power in a kibble balance. Accordingly, &quot;g&quot; must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of &quot;g&quot; must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, &quot;g&quot; is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilised helium–neon laser interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the &#x27;gravity&#x27; term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST&#x27;s Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8 ppb of .

<doc id="692013" wikidata="Q2004727" url="?curid=692013" title="Autobiography of Weni">
<text>The Autobiography of Weni is a tomb inscription from Ancient Egypt, which is significant to Egyptology studies. Weni the Elder, or Uni, was a court official of the 6th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt.

The location of the Tomb of Weni was lost as a result of Auguste Mariette&#x27;s 1880 description of Weni&#x27;s tomb being unclear (&quot;[on] the high hill which gives the middle cemetery its name&quot;). It was rediscovered in 1999 by an American archaeologist team led by Dr. Janet Richards. More recent works in the necropolis of Pepi I in Saqqara uncovered a second tomb for Weni with a near-identical copy of his biography. 

==Biography==
Weni began his career under Teti, and rose through the ranks of the administration under Pepi I Meryre, for whom he was in turn a judge, a general and a vizier. Later, Weni became the governor of Upper Egypt during the reign of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. As judge he investigated the queen who was apparently suspected of involvement in a conspiracy. While he was general, he reorganized the military into a format that was still in use in the New Kingdom.

Weni rose through the ranks of the military to become commander in chief of the army. He was considered by both his contemporaries and many Egyptologists to have been a brilliant tactician. His victories earned him the privilege of being shown leading the troops into battle, a right usually reserved for pharaohs. Weni is the first person, other than a pharaoh, known to have been portrayed in this manner. Many of his battles were in the Levant and the Sinai. He is said to have pursued a group of marauders all the way to Mount Carmel. He battled a semi-nomadic people known in Ancient Egyptian texts as &quot;the sand-dwellers&quot; at least five times.

While he was commander in chief of the army, he made several key reforms to the military. He began training his troops to have a pre-emptive rather than a defensive posture. Weni included Nubian mercenaries in the army for the first time and he reorganized the army to control infighting amongst the troops and to minimise uncontrolled pillaging. He recorded his reorganization of the army in great detail and his reforms lasted until the time of the New Kingdom.

After the death of Pepi, Weni was appointed the governor of Upper Egypt by Merenre. He made many infrastructure improvements, some of which were beneficial to the military. His most noted project was a canal that ran parallel to the Nile at the First Cataract. He likely died during Merenre&#x27;s reign.

<text>The ampere balance (also current balance or Kelvin balance) is an electromechanical apparatus used for the precise measurement of the SI unit of electric current, the ampere. It was invented by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin.

The current to be measured is passed in series through two coils of wire, one of which is attached to one arm of a sensitive balance. The magnetic force between the two coils is measured by the amount of weight needed on the other arm of the balance to keep it in equilibrium. This is used to calculate the numerical value of the current.

The main weakness of the ampere balance is that the calculation of the current involves the dimensions of the coils. So the accuracy of the current measurement is limited by the accuracy with which the coils can be measured, and their mechanical rigidity.

A more complicated version of an ampere balance, that removes this source of inaccuracy by a calibration step, is the Kibble balance, invented by Bryan Kibble in 1975. This experimental device was developed at government metrology laboratories worldwide with the goal of providing a more accurate definition of the kilogram, the world&#x27;s standard of mass. In this application, the Kibble balance functions in the reverse sense to the Ampere balance: it was used to weigh the International Prototype of the Kilogram, defining the kilogram in terms of an electric current and a voltage. In 2019, the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole were redefined in terms of fundamental constants, removing the dependence on physical objects.

== Usage ==
Approximate readings may be obtained by reading the position of the weight on the scale, or a more accurate reading may be obtained as follows: The upper edge of the shelf on which the weights slide is graduated into equal divisions, and the weight is provided with a sharp tongue of metal in order that its position on the shelf may be accurately determined. Since the current passing through the balance when is obtained with a given weight is proportional to the square root of the couple due to this weight, it follows that the current strength when equilibrium is obtained is proportional to the product of the square root of the weight used and the displacement of this weight from its zero position. Each instrument is accompanied by a pair of weights and by a square root table, so that the product of the square roots of the number corresponding to the position of the sliding weight and the ascertained constant for each weight, gives at once the value of the current in amperes. Each of these balances is made to cover a certain range of reading. Thus, the centiampere balance ranges from 1 to 100 centiamperes, the deciampere balance from 1 to 100 deciamperes, the ampere balance from 1 to 100 amperes, etc.

<text>Nuevo tango (&quot;New tango&quot;) is both a form of music in which new elements are incorporated into traditional tango music, and an evolution of tango dance that began to develop in the 1980s.

==Dance==
===Origins===
Prior to the 1990s, Argentine tango was taught with a didactic method: teaching tango by having students copy examples shown by the instructor. Emphasis was not given to how or why movement was done a certain way. Tango dance in Argentina fell into general disrepute during the junta of 1976–83, to the point that the few professionals left as teachers were looked down upon, and the young people of the time rarely participated in the few opportunities to dance. Ironically, the quote &quot;el ser Argentino…vive la expresion tango&quot; (meaning tango is part of the Argentine essence, or identity) comes from the 1975 book &quot;El Tango y Gardel&quot;, commissioned by the Argentine government in homage to Carlos Gardel. Gustavo Naveira&#x27;s instruction began to be offered after Argentina became democratic again in 1983 and restrictions on social life eased. He reported that despite his nerves about teaching, the classes drew &quot;crowds of 200 or more&quot;, and many older former dancers became instructors as social tango returned. The popular reinstatement of tango is culturally seen by many Argentines as a point of nationalistic pride and self-representation.

Starting in the 1990s in Buenos Aires, the Tango Investigation Group (later transformed into the Cosmotango organization) founded by Gustavo Naveira and Fabián Salas applied the principles of dance kinesiology from modern dance to analyze the physics of movement in Argentine tango. Taking what they learned from this analysis they then began to explore all the possibilities of movement within the framework of Argentine Tango. From the work of these founders of the tango nuevo movement, there was shift in all styles of tango away from teaching what to dance toward teaching how to dance. 

&quot;Milonga&quot; in the last decades of the 20th century maintained a sense of exclusion toward the new tango style, where &quot;the clash was between generations&quot; whose older constituents acted as stewards of the formulaic style. According to one professional, &quot;They didn’t want anybody else to come and change things.&quot; The alternative center for young dancers then sprang up in the form of the modern practica, beginning with the opening of the popular El Motivo at the Villa Malcolm social club in 2004. The accelerating creation of a nuevo tango beginning around this time is consistent with anthropologist Martin Stokes&#x27;s idea that dance is a play form, and that along with music it is a form of &quot;social creativity&quot;, subject to instability in times of social change. Its formation and forging of a new social scene exemplifies the view of musical anthropology that music creates, rather than is created from, social life.

Though widely referred to as a tango style outside of Argentina, tango nuevo is not considered a style of dancing tango by the founders of the movement. It refers only to the method of analysis and teaching developed through the application of the principles of dance kinesiology to Argentine tango. In 2009, Gustavo Naveira published an essay &quot;New Tango&quot;, in which he states: &quot;There is great confusion on the question of the way of dancing the tango: call it technique, form, or style. The term Tango Nuevo, is used to refer to a style of dancing, which is an error. In reality, Tango Nuevo is everything that has happened with the tango since the 1980s. It is not a question of a style... The words Tango Nuevo express what is happening with tango dancing in general; namely that it is evolving.&quot; Therefore, as Gustavo Naveira and the other founders of the tango nuevo movement have said, all styles of tango, which have now been influenced by the analysis of the dance, are all tango nuevo.

Despite the insistence by the founders of the tango nuevo movement that it is not a single style, it has become an accepted term by many that it is a separate and distinct style of tango. Considered by many as the most famous practitioners of tango nuevo are Mariano &quot;Chicho&quot; Frumboli, Pablo Verón, Roberto Herrera (who even dedicated a whole Tango show to this new style: &quot;Tango Nuevo&quot;, premiere 2005), Gustavo Naveira, Norberto &quot;El Pulpo&quot; Esbrés, Fabián Salas, Esteban Moreno, Claudia Codega, Sebastián Arce and Mariana Montes. All of these dancers have highly individual styles that cannot be confused with each other, yet are all referred to by many as the tango nuevo style.

Critics of what some call the tango nuevo style claim that with all the emphasis being on the physics of the dance, that the connection to the music, the feeling, and the traditions of Argentine tango have been lost to the newer generations of tango dancers. Referring to the newer generations of tango nuevo dancers, one of the founders of the tango nuevo movement, Mariano &quot;Chicho&quot; Frumboli stated in an interview: &quot;They are completely lost! I learnt with the last great milongueros, I took the information directly from them. [...] The problem is that we missed something in the teaching, I take total responsibility, and other colleagues should do so as well. I can&#x27;t pass on what I have learned. I was crazy about creating, because I saw a new vein in the evolution of the movement. I threw myself into that, and I lost the way to be able to pass on the tango essence that I have very much inside. Because of this I feel that lately there are a lot of people who don&#x27;t understand or know what the real essence of this dance is.&quot;

Critics of tango nuevo also say that there is little difference in the way it is practiced than show tango. In an interview, Mariano Frumboli said: &quot;Today you do a volcada and a colgada and it is the same because they are there, commercially speaking, in the same package. Then, between doing a sandwichito or a volcada… people do a volcada! Because it&#x27;s more eye-catching. [...] They are not going to make a sandwichito to enjoy that moment, but whatever shows them more and better.&quot; The increased openness in bodily movement extends to the face, where previously the &quot;cara de tango&quot; or standardized expression of passion was socially required; this is no longer a given between professional dancers at social tango events.

In July 2009, Gustavo Naveira wrote about nuevo tango:
==Music==

The most important composer of nuevo tango was Astor Piazzolla, who revolutionized tango in the 1950s by introducing new instruments such as the saxophone and electric guitar, and who brought new forms of harmonic and melodic structure into the traditional tango. Piazzolla&#x27;s Quintento Nuevo Tango (1978–1988) with Astor Piazzolla, Fernando Suarez Paz, Hector Console, Horacio Malvicino and Pablo Ziegler was decisive for the worldwide success of Nuevo Tango. Sometime later, Piazzolla met jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, which led to the production of an album considered a classic of the genre: &quot;Summit&quot;.

Other composers of tango nuevo include Osvaldo Pugliese, Ariel Ramirez, and Juan Carlos Caceres. Neotango is 21st century tango composed and/or orchestrated in the 21st century. Often it includes the fusion of electronic and acoustic sounds. Some examples of neotango music artists are Tanghetto, Bajofondo, Electrocutango, Federico Aubele, Gotan Project, Nuevo Tango Ensamble, Ensemble Montréal Tango, &quot;Narcotango&quot; (album by Carlos Libedinsky), Dure-mère, Rodrigo Favela (Latin tango), Pablo Ziegler and Otros Aires.

<text>PIONIER is the Polish national research and education network created to provide high-speed Internet access and to conduct network-based research. Most of the government founded higher education organisations and all of metropolitan area networks in Poland are connected to the PIONIER network, and are members of the PIONIER Consortium. The previous versions of the Polish academic computer network were called POL-34 and POL-155.

==History==

POL-34 was created as a result of an experiment hosted in Poznań in 1997 during a scientific conference in which the representatives of all major Polish MAN&#x27;s took part. Its target was to create a high-speed WAN. During the experiment Poznań, Łódź and Gdańsk were connected and the 34 Mbit/s ATM network in a 622 Mbit/s SDH environment has been created and since then called POL-34. Since its creation, POL-34 has been a purely Internet Protocol network.

In the beginning, POL-34 used fiber-optic links leased from TEL-ENERGO, a company founded by State Power Companies, Polish Power Networks and Polish Power Distribution Association. At the same time, ever since its creation POL-34 was in the process of creating its own infrastructure. Today the Consortium owns all fiber-optic connections to major nodes.

In 1999 a project to extend the bandwidth of the network was proposed and POL-155 was created. Speed was expanded to 155 Mbit/s Asynchronous Transfer Mode between Gdańsk, Łódź and Poznań and a constant effort to create 155 Mbit/s links between smaller nodes was made.

In 2000 POL-34/155 and various other academic organisations set up a project of creating a 10 Gbit/s network within GEANT project. Network called PIONIER is the result of that project.

==Organization==

Currently the network connects Białystok, Bielsko-Biała, Bydgoszcz, Częstochowa, Gdańsk, Gliwice, Kielce, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Opole, Poznań, Puławy, Radom, Toruń, Warsaw, Wrocław, Koszalin, Szczecin, Olsztyn and Zielona Góra with a fiber-optic 10 Gbit/s patch-cord, and consists of 5738,86 km of optical fiber. PIONIER&#x27;s Network Operations Center is based in Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center.

It has connections to various commercial networks, national research and education networks (CESNET, DFN, SANET, URAN), and is well integrated with the GÉANT network.

Both POL-34/155 and PIONIER is operated by a consortium of 22 metropolitan area network operators and other educational institutions. Decisions within the consortium are made by voting.

<text>Grigorii Petrovich Maksimov (; 1893–1950) was a Russian anarcho-syndicalist. From the first days of the Russian Revolution, he played a leading role in the country&#x27;s syndicalist movement – editing the newspaper &quot;Golos Truda&quot; and organising the formation of factory committees. Following the October Revolution, he came into conflict with the Bolsheviks, who he fiercely criticised for their authoritarian and centralist tendencies. For his anti-Bolshevik activities, he was eventually arrested and imprisoned, before finally being deported from the country. In exile, he continued to lead the anarcho-syndicalist movement, spearheading the establishment of the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA), of which he was a member until his death.

==Biography==
In 1893, Grigorii Petrovich Maksimov was born into a peasant family in Smolensk. He studied at a seminary of the Orthodox Church in Vladimir, but ultimately decided not to become a priest and instead moved to Saint Petersburg, where he studied to become an agriculturist. During his time at the Agricultural Academy, he became acquainted with anarchism, through the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin.

After graduating in 1915, he was immediately drafted into the Imperial Russian Army and deployed to the Eastern Front. He returned to Petrograd during the February Revolution and participated in the workers&#x27; strikes that overthrew the Russian Empire. He quickly became a prolific speaker in factories and at workers&#x27; rallies. By June 1917, he had been elected to the city&#x27;s central council of factory committees and became one of its most active members, as part of a rising tide of anarcho-syndicalism in the Russian capital.

In August 1917, he joined the editorial staff of the anarcho-syndicalist newspaper &quot;Golos Truda&quot; and became one of its main contributors. In the articles he penned for the paper, Maksimov spoke in favour of the factory committees as a model for workers&#x27; control, while he criticised mainstream Russian trade unions, which he considered to be a relic of capitalism. He also criticised the anarcho-communists for their advocacy of the immediate expropriation of factories by workers, instead believing in the need for a transitional stage for workers to be trained for the tasks of self-management.

Following the October Revolution, Maksimov participated in the First All Russian Congress of Trade Unions, where delegates of the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks resolved to integrate the anarcho-syndicalist factory committees into the state-controlled trade unions. Maksimov objected, crediting the factory committees for the overthrow of capitalism and the Tsarist autocracy, and cited Karl Marx&#x27;s appeals for a permanent revolution against the state, even declaring himself a better Marxist than the Marxists themselves. Maksimov rebuffed the claims of David Riazanov, who favoured the trade unions, dismissing him as a &quot;white-handed intellectual who had never worked, never sweated, never felt life.&quot; But despite Maksimov&#x27;s objections, the Bolshevik-majority Congress voted to dissolve the factory committees and to convert them into organs of the state&#x27;s trade union apparatus. 

In &quot;Golos Truda&quot;, Maksimov denounced the centralisation of industry by the Bolshevik party and declared that Russian anarchists should oppose the Soviets, as they were by this time under the control of the state. When there was a subsequent flare-up of terrorism by the anarcho-communists, he condemned their violent tactics, arguing that they shifted revolutionary energy away from organised action. Political repression followed soon after, with the Bolshevik government closing down &quot;Golos Truda&quot; in May 1918.

In August 1918, Maksimov participated in the First All-Russian Conference of Anarcho-Syndicalists, which was held in Moscow. The conference was fiercely critical of the Bolshevik government, which it denounced as a regime of &quot;state capitalism&quot;. To express the anarcho-syndicalist critique, the conference also established a new newspaper, &quot;Volny Golos Truda&quot;, which was edited by Maksimov. But the critical articles published in this paper quickly resulted in it being shut down. Despite this setback, in November 1918, the syndicalists were able to convene a second congress, which resolved to form a nationwide anarcho-syndicalist confederation. The conference elected Maksimov as secretary of an Executive Bureau that would form this confederation. 

During the subsequent period, Maksimov attempted to organise food workers into underground factory committees, which he hoped would form the nucleus of a nationwide General Confederation of Labor. In March 1920, Maksimov spoke at the Second All-Russian Congress of Food-Industry Workers, which adopted his resolution that denounced the Bolshevik&#x27;s &quot;dictatorship over the proletariat&quot; and called for the establishment of free soviets. Although his own organising efforts resulted in little success on this front, Maksimov&#x27;s idea for a decentralised workers&#x27; confederation was taken up by the workers&#x27; opposition, led by Aleksandra Kollontai.
In November 1920, during a wave of political repression against the anarchist movement, Maksimov was arrested by the Cheka and held in custody for weeks. Following the outbreak of the Kronstadt rebellion, the 10th Bolshevik Party Congress declared a ban on factions, suppressing the workers&#x27; opposition and imprisoning Maksimov. In order to draw the attention of visiting European syndicalists, who had arrived in Moscow for the first congress of the Profintern, Maksimov and his fellow anarchist inmates in Taganka prison staged a hunger strike. The resulting protest forced the Soviet government to release the prisoners, on condition that they immediately leave the country. In January 1922, Maksimov left for Berlin.

In their German exile, the anarcho-syndicalists founded a new newspaper called &quot;Robochii Put&quot; (), printed using the presses of the Free Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (FAUD). Out of a reaction to the disorganisation of the Russian anarchist movement, Maksimov and his fellow emigrants resolved to establish an international syndicalist organisation, together with their foreign comrades. In December 1922, they established the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA).

After a brief stay in Paris, in 1925, he moved to the Chicago, where he hung wallpaper and edited &quot;Golos Truzhenika&quot;, the Russian language organ of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Following Peter Arshinov&#x27;s defection to the Soviet Union, Maksimov also took up editing &quot;Delo Truda&quot;, which took a notedly more syndicalist stance under his stewardship. During his time in the United States, Maksimov attempted to reconcile the syndicalist and communist factions of the anarchist movement. In 1933, he published a &quot;Social Credo&quot; that synthesised the two tendencies, drawing from the works of Peter Kropotkin. He called for the IWA to form agricultural cooperatives and factory committees in order to transform the economy, as part of a transition towards communism.

In 1940, he merged &quot;Delo Truda&quot; with the Detroit-based journal &quot;Probuzhdenie&quot;, which kept him busy as its editor. During the 1940s, he also wrote a history of Soviet political repression and compiled a collection of the Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s works.

In 1950, Grigorii Petrovich Maksimov died of a heart attack. He is interred in Waldheim Cemetery, near other Chicago anarchists.

<text>Skorradalsvatn () is a lake in the west of Iceland. It is situated in a narrow valley between the Hvalfjörður and the valley &quot;Reykholtsdalur&quot; (see Reykholt). Its length is about 15 km.

Around the lake there are some high mountains, for example Skarðsheiði . Unusually for Iceland, the shores of the lake are quite forested due to reforestation started by a governmental initiative. Consequently, the valley looks a bit like some regions in the Alps, for example near Salzburg in Austria.

The lake is also a reservoir so that the level of the water surface has been raised.

There are no villages on the shores, but many of summer houses.

<doc id="692068" wikidata="Q1585737" url="?curid=692068" title="Black Elk Peak">
<text>Black Elk Peak, formerly known as Harney Peak, is the highest natural point in the U.S. state of South Dakota and the Midwestern United States. It lies in the Black Elk Wilderness area, in southern Pennington County, in the Black Hills. The peak lies west-southwest of Mount Rushmore. At , it is the highest summit in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Though part of the North American Cordillera, it is generally considered to be geologically separate from the Rocky Mountains.

It is also known as Hiŋháŋ Káǧa (&#x27;owl-maker&#x27; in Lakota) and Heȟáka Sápa (&#x27;elk black&#x27;).

The U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which has jurisdiction in federal lands, officially changed the mountain&#x27;s name from Harney Peak to Black Elk Peak on August 11, 2016, honoring Black Elk, the noted Lakota Sioux medicine man and Catholic Servant of God for whom the Wilderness Area is named.

In September 2016, a team of professional surveyors obtained precise GNSS data over the course of two days and found the highest natural rock to be at NAVD88 and a nearby secondary peak located approximately 300 feet south of the lookout tower and unofficially named &quot;McGillicuddy&#x27;s Peak&quot;, to be slightly lower at NAVD88. This is believed to be the only precise survey that has been made to determine the true elevation of this peak.

The peak&#x27;s fire lookout tower and the staircase leading to it, as well as a nearby dam and pumphouse, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

==Name==
This peak was called &quot;Hiŋháŋ Káǧa&quot;, or, &quot;Owl maker,&quot; after rock formations that look like owls (and the association of owls with impending death by the Lakota Sioux). They dominated this region and inhabited the territory at the time of European colonization. They considered it a sacred site within the Black Hills, which they call &quot;Pahá Sápa&quot; and &quot;Ȟé Sápa&quot;.

The mountain was named Harney Peak in 1855 by American Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren in honor of US General William S. Harney, his commander in a regional military expedition. In punitive retaliation for other Sioux raids, in September 1855 Harney&#x27;s forces killed Sicangu warriors, women and children in what Americans called the Battle of Blue Water Creek in Garden County, Nebraska.

Harney later commanded the United States military in the Black Hills area in the late 1870s. 
The Lakota had tried to get the name of the peak changed for 50 years, as Harney had massacred their people.

In 2014 the Sioux renewed their effort to get the name changed, in an effort led by Basil Brave Heart of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A Korean War veteran, he felt that Harney had not honored the military with his action.

Some Lakota requested state officials in 2015 to reinstate their original name for the peak. The Lakota Council of the Pine Ridge Reservation and descendants of Black Elk, a noted medicine man, supported naming it for him, as the national wilderness area around the peak is named for the shaman. He became known beyond the Lakota in part through the book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; (1932), written by John G. Neihardt from long talks with the shaman. South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard opposed the name change, as did other state officials, and no action was taken in 2015.

The U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially changed the mountain&#x27;s name from &quot;Harney Peak&quot; to &quot;Black Elk Peak&quot; on August 11, 2016, by a unanimous vote of 12–0, with one abstention. On August 18, 2016, Gov. Daugaard announced that the state would accept the new name.

==History==

Black Elk Peak and the Black Hills were located within the Great Sioux Reservation established by the United States government in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868; it covered most of the territory west of the Missouri River in South Dakota (the area now called West River). American settlement was concentrated east of the river, where there was more water for farming.

The first American settlers believed to have reached the summit were a party led by General George Armstrong Custer in 1874, during the Black Hills expedition. The federal government took back the Black Hills and another strip of land in a new treaty in 1877. More than a decade later, it broke up the Great Sioux Reservation in 1889 into five smaller reservations, the same year that North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted as states to the Union. The government made some nine million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase for ranching and homesteading. Most American settlement in West River did not start until the early 20th century. The area attracted many European immigrants as well as settlers from the East.

Black Elk Peak is the site where Black Elk (Lakota Sioux) received his &quot;Great Vision&quot; when nine years old. He later became a medicine man known for his wisdom. Late in life, he returned to the peak accompanied by writer John Neihardt. Black Elk was sharing much of his life and philosophy with Neihardt through long talks translated by his son. Neihardt tried to express the medicine man&#x27;s wisdom in his book &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; (1932).

Neihardt recorded Black Elk&#x27;s words about his vision as follows:

&quot;I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world,&quot; he is quoted as saying. &quot;And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.&quot;

New York mining promoter James Wilson organized the Harney Peak Tin Company around 1884 or 1885. The Harney Peak Tin Company did not actually mine any tin and was liquidated by court order in the 1890s, losing investors almost $3 million (equivalent to approximately $ million in ) in the largest fraud scandal in Black Hills mining history.

American settlers used Black Elk Peak as a fire lookout tower in 1911, with a wood crate placed at the summit for a seat. In 1920, a 12&#x27;x12&#x27; wood structure was built, and it was expanded to 16&#x27;x16&#x27; the following year. The federal Civilian Conservation Corps enlisted local men and completed construction of a stone fire tower in 1938, one of numerous projects in the state during the Great Depression. The Harney Peak fire tower was last staffed in 1967.

A United States post office was operated at Black Elk Peak from 1936 until 1942, and again from 1945 until 1946. The Harney Peak post office was reportedly one of the &quot;most elevated post offices in the United States&quot;.

A manmade dam was also created on the peak in 1935. This concrete reservoir holds of water; a pumphouse was added in 1938. In 1982, the lookout tower and its stairway, dam, and pumphouse were nominated by the USDA Forest Service for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The Forest Service cited the site&#x27;s cultural, recreational, and architectural significance to South Dakota. On March 10, 1983, the site was officially added to the register.

==Climate==
==Hiking==

The summit can be reached from Sylvan Lake, Camp Remington, Highway 244, Palmer Creek Rd., Mount Rushmore, or Horse Thief Lake. From the trailhead at Sylvan Lake in Custer State Park, to the summit and back is about . This is the shortest, least strenuous, and most popular route. No permit is required for use of the trail. However, A South Dakota State Parks pass is required to access the Sylvan Lake trailhead.

An old stone tower, once used as a fire lookout tower, is located at the summit. The ashes of Valentine McGillycuddy were interred near the base of the tower and a plaque reads, &quot;Valentine McGillycuddy, Wasicu Wakan.&quot; &quot;Wasicu Wakan&quot; is Lakota for &quot;Holy White Man.&quot;

<doc id="692071" wikidata="Q2468103" url="?curid=692071" title="USCGC Taney">
<text>WPG/WAGC/WHEC-37, launched as USCGC &quot;Roger B. Taney and for most of her career calledUSCGC &quot;Taney (), is a United States Coast Guard high endurance cutter notable as the last warship floating which fought in the attack on Pearl Harbor. She was named for Roger B. Taney (1777–1864), who served as U.S. Attorney General, Secretary of the Treasury, and Chief Justice of the United States.

She is also one of two Treasury-class (out of seven total) Coast Guard cutters still afloat. Active for 50 years, &quot;Taney&quot; saw action in both theaters of combat in World War II, serving as a command ship at the Battle of Okinawa, and as a fleet escort in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She also served in the Vietnam War, taking part in Operation Market Time. &quot;Taney&quot; was also used in drug interdiction and fisheries protection work.

She was decommissioned in 1986, and has since served as a museum ship in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Maryland. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1988. In 2020, Historic Ships in Baltimore and the Living Classrooms Foundation announced that they will remove the name &quot;Taney&quot; from the ship, in recognition of her namesake&#x27;s historical acts of racial injustice, instead identifying her as simply WHEC-37.

==1936–1941==
Treasury-class &quot;Roger B. Taney&quot;, Coast Guard Builders No. 68, was laid on 1 May 1935 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was launched on 3 June 1936 and was sponsored by Miss Corinne F. Taney. She was commissioned at Philadelphia on 24 October 1936. The &quot;Roger B. Taney&quot; departed Philadelphia on 19 December, transited the Panama Canal from 27 to 29 December, and arrived at her home port, Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, on 18 January 1937. She conducted local operations out of Honolulu through the summer of 1937. On 16 June 1937, she transferred a number of her crew for temporary duty to USCGC &quot;Itasca&quot;. The &quot;Itasca&quot; was preparing to lend navigational support to Amelia Earhart&#x27;s flight around the world. In May or June 1937 &quot;Roger B. Taney&quot;&#x27;s name was shortened to simply &quot;Taney&quot;.

The &quot;Taney&quot; had arrived in the Pacific at a time when the United States, and Pan-American Airways in particular, was expanding its commercial air travel capabilities. The &quot;Clipper&quot; flights across the Pacific to the Far East made islands like Hawaii, Midway, Guam, and Wake Island important way-stations. Other islands and islets assumed greater importance when a route across the South Pacific was mapped out to Australia and Samoa. The military benefits which accrued to the United States by its expansion onto some of the more strategic bits of land in the broad Pacific were not lost upon President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who undertook, in the late 1930s, to annex territory in the Pacific.

Two such places were Kanton and Enderbury Islands. The &quot;Taney&quot; played a role in their colonization by the United States. In early March 1938, the Coast Guard cutter loaded supplies and embarked colonists who would establish the claim of the United States upon the two islands that seemed—at least to the uninitiated—to be mere hunks of coral, rock, and scrub in the Central Pacific. She disembarked four Hawaiians at Enderbury Island on 6 March 1938 and landed a second contingent—of seven colonists—at Canton Island on the next day. The men, assisted by the Coast Guardsmen, erected buildings and laid the foundations for future signal towers.

The Coast Guard&#x27;s task over the ensuing years leading up to the outbreak of war in the Pacific was to supply these isolated way-stations along the transpacific air routes and to relieve the colonists at stated intervals. &quot;Taney&quot; performed these supply missions into 1940. Meanwhile, tension continued to rise in the Far East as Japan cast covetous glances at the American, British, Dutch, and French colonial possessions and marched deeper into embattled China.

As the Navy and Coast Guard began gradually increasing and augmenting the armament on its vessels to prepare them for the inexorably advancing war, &quot;Taney&quot; underwent her first major rearmament at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard in December 1940. She received her last major pre-war refit at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, in the spring of the following year, 1941. On 25 July 1941, the Coast Guard cutter was transferred to the Navy and reported for duty with the local defense forces of the 14th Naval District, maintaining her base at Honolulu.

Outside another &quot;line island cruise&quot; in the late summer, &quot;Taney&quot; operated locally out of Honolulu into the critical fall of 1941. She conducted regular harbor entrance and channel patrols, alternating often with one of the four old destroyers of Destroyer Division 80: , , , and .

==World War II==
The message: &quot;Air Raid, Pearl Harbor. This is no drill&quot; came at 07:55 on 7 December 1941, as Japanese planes swept overhead in an attempt to cripple the Pacific Fleet. &quot;Taney&quot;, moored alongside Pier 6, Honolulu harbor, manned her anti-aircraft guns within four minutes. Officers not aboard were ordered to return and the ship readied to get underway. The ship began firing newly installed three inch guns at Japanese planes passing high overhead. The ship fired on a second and third group of attacking planes, the last of which flew over the Honolulu harbor entrance, perhaps intending to attack the power plant, and was low enough to be engaged by the 50 caliber machine guns. The Japanese planes changed course to avoid &quot;Taney&#x27;s&quot; fire. Coast Guardsmen from the &quot;Taney&quot; were ordered to take up defensive positions around Aloha Tower and protect it from being occupied.

The ship got underway at 0546 on 8 December to patrol the harbor approaches making seven sound contacts and dropping depth charges during the patrol that ended on 14 December. &quot;Taney&quot; patrolled the waters off Honolulu for the remainder of 1941 and into 1942, conducting many depth charge attacks on suspected submarines in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. During this time, the ship received the classification WPG-37. On 22 January 1942, the cutter departed Honolulu in company with USAT &quot;Barbara Olson&quot;, and arrived at Kanton Island on 28 January 1942. After sending a working party ashore to unload supplies, &quot;Taney&quot; screened &quot;Barbara Olson&quot; offshore until 7 February 1942, when both ships got under way to evacuate the American colony on Enderbury Island. Embarking the four colonists at 10:15 that day, &quot;Taney&quot; shelled the island and destroyed its buildings to prevent them from being used by Japanese forces. &quot;Taney&quot; subsequently escorted her merchantman consort to Jarvis Island, where she evacuated the four Interior Department colonists and burned all structures to the ground before departing. Reaching Palmyra Atoll on 12 February 1942, the ships remained there until 15 February 1942, before &quot;Taney&quot; headed back for the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Honolulu on 5 March 1942. She made another voyage to Palmyra Island later that spring and when heading back to Hawaii, she received orders to search for survivors in the waters around Midway Island after the Battle of Midway, including a stop at the island itself.

&quot;Taney&quot; operated locally out of Honolulu into 1943 before sailing for Boston late that winter. Prior to heading for the east coast, the ship received a re-gunning at Mare Island, being fitted with four single-mount 5-inch guns, making her the only ship in her class with this modification. After making port at Boston on 14 March 1944, &quot;Taney&quot; soon shifted south to Hampton Roads, where she arrived on 31 March 1944. Early in April, she departed Norfolk as a unit of Task Force 66 (TF 66) as convoy guide for convoy UGS-38. The passage across the Atlantic proved uneventful, as the convoy made landfall off the Azores on 13 April 1944.

Some 35 minutes after sunset on 20 April 1944, however, the convoy was spotted and tracked by the Germans, who launched a three-pronged attack with Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 medium bombers. Each flew very low, using the shoreline as a background, thus confusing the search radar of the Allied ships. The first wave struck from dead ahead, torpedoing SS Paul Hamilton and SS &quot;Samite&quot;. &quot;Hamilton&quot;, which had been carrying both a load of ammunition and hundreds of Army Air Force personnel, blew up in an explosion that killed all 504 men on board.

The second wave of German torpedo planes hit the SS &quot;Stephen F. Austin&quot; and SS &quot;Royal Star&quot;. Two torpedoes passed close by &quot;Taney&quot;. The third wave damaged , which later sank. All of the damaged vessels — save &quot;Paul Hamilton&quot; and &quot;Lansdale&quot; — reached Bizerte, Tunisia, on 21 April 1944. &quot;Taney&quot; later departed Bizerte with homeward-bound convoy GUS-38 and arrived at New York City on 21 May 1944.

&quot;Taney&quot; participated in two more round-trip convoy escort missions, with convoys UGS/GUS-45 and UGS/GUS-52. Detached as a unit of TF 66 on 9 October 1944, she sailed for the Boston Navy Yard soon thereafter for extensive yard work to convert her to an amphibious command ship. During this metamorphosis, &quot;Taney&quot; — classified as WAGC-37 — was fitted with accommodations for an embarked flag officer and his staff, as well as with increased communications and radar facilities. Her main battery also underwent change: she now sported two open-mount 5-inch guns, as well as 40- and 20-millimeter antiaircraft guns. With the work completed in early January 1945, &quot;Taney&quot; departed Boston on 19 January 1945, bound for Norfolk, Virginia.

She conducted shakedown and training in her new configuration before departing the east coast and sailing, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, to Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 22 February 1945, she soon embarked Rear Admiral Calvin H. Cobb and later underwent various minor repairs. New communications equipment was also installed before the ship departed the Hawaiian Islands for the Marshalls on 10 March 1945.

&quot;Taney&quot; proceeded independently via Eniwetok and arrived at Ulithi on 23 March 1945, remaining there until 7 April 1945. Joining Task Group 51.8 (TG 51.8), the amphibious command ship proceeded to Okinawa and arrived off the Hagushi beaches amidst air raid alerts on 11 April. During one raid, her antiaircraft gunners achieved at least three hits on a Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bomber which crossed the ship&#x27;s bow away, and later during her first day at Okinawa experienced four more &quot;red alerts&quot;. The ship briefly shifted to Kerama Retto from 13 to 15 April before returning to Hagushi on the latter date.

By the end of May 1945, &quot;Taney&quot; had gone to general quarters 119 times, with the crew remaining at battle stations for up to nine hours at a stretch. During this period off Okinawa in April and May, &quot;Taney&quot; downed four suicide planes and assisted in numerous other &quot;kills&quot;. The command ship also conducted combat information center duties, maintaining complete radar and air coverage, receiving and evaluating information on both friendly and enemy activities. On one occasion, &quot;Taney&quot;&#x27;s duties took her close inshore close enough to even receive fire close aboard from a Japanese shore battery.

Suicide air attacks by the Japanese continued throughout June 1945, although most were intercepted by combat air patrol (CAP) fighters and downed before they could reach their targets. Such raids took place on 18 out of 30 days that month. On 25 June 1945, at 01:20, a float seaplane passed near &quot;Taney&quot;, provoking return fire from the command ship and batteries ashore which combined to splash the intruder. During this month-long period, at least 288 enemy planes attacked the ships in &quot;Taney&quot;&#x27;s vicinity, and at least 96 of these were destroyed.

In mid-July 1945 a typhoon forced the ships at Hagushi to take evasive action. &quot;Taney&quot; led a convoy eastward on 19 July 1945 and returned the next day when the storm passed. She performed the same duties again on 1 August 1945 when she led a convoy to sea on typhoon-evasion operations. The ship returned to its anchorage on 3 August 1945.

The end of the war found &quot;Taney&quot; still off Okinawa. On 16 August 1945, she got under way to support as three Japanese planes were detected approaching from the northeast. One crashed to the north, and two crashed into the sea shortly thereafter. On 25 August 1945, TG 95.5 was dissolved, and Rear Admiral Cobb, who had been embarked during the Okinawa campaign, hauled down his flag and departed.

&quot;Taney&quot; soon proceeded to Japan, where she took part in the occupation of Wakayama, anchoring off the port city on 11 September 1945 and sending a working party ashore the next day. While anchored there, &quot;Taney&quot; weathered a typhoon on 17 September 1945. She was, in fact, one of the few ships which stayed at her berth during the storm, her ground tackle holding well in the sticky clay bottom.

Departing Wakayama on 14 October 1945, &quot;Taney&quot; returned to the west coast of the United States, via Midway, and arrived at San Francisco on 29 October 1945. Moving on for the east coast, &quot;Taney&quot; transited the Panama Canal and later arrived at her ultimate destination, Charleston, South Carolina, on 29 November 1945. During the ensuing period of conversion, the Coast Guard vessel was reconfigured as a patrol cutter. She now sported a main battery of a single-mount 5-inch gun, a hedgehog, a twin 40-millimeter mount, and two 20-millimeter guns, in addition to depth charge tracks and projectors and was reclassified once again as WPG-37.

==1946–1961==

Upon shifting back to the west coast, &quot;Taney&quot; was based at Alameda, California until February 1972. Her primary post-war duty was serving as an ocean station weather ship. The weather patrols (later termed &quot;ocean station patrols&quot;) consisted of sailing for three weeks on assigned stations in the Pacific, and each cutter assigned performed four or five such patrols each year. Their primary task was to report meteorological information, which was used in weather forecasts for the burgeoning trans-Pacific commercial air traffic as well as for surface vessels. The ocean station vessels also provided communications and navigation assistance and were always standing by for search and rescue emergencies. She also conducted dedicated law enforcement and search and rescue patrols, or stood on search and rescue standby, when she was not on ocean station duty.

In June through July 1949 &quot;Taney&quot; served on &quot;Ocean Station Fox&quot; and later in July she served on &quot;Ocean Station Able&quot;. In June 1950 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Oboe&quot; and in September she served on &quot;Ocean Station Fox&quot;. In January through February 1951 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Uncle&quot; and the following year, August to September, she served on &quot;Ocean Station Uncle&quot;. Later in 1952, from November to December, she served on &quot;Ocean Station Nan&quot;. In April to May 1953 &quot;Taney&quot; served on &quot;Ocean Station Victor&quot; and in June of that year she served on &quot;Ocean Station Victor&quot;. From 4 to 25 October 1953 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Uncle&quot; and from June to July 1954 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Nan&quot;. In November of that same year she again served on &quot;Ocean Station Nan&quot;. In March and April and again in June and July 1956 she served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot;. She again served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; from January to February, June to July, and October to November 1957 and from February to March and August 1958. She served on &quot;Ocean Station Romeo&quot; from October to November 1958. She served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; from December 1958 to January 1959, May to June, and October to November 1959.

The &quot;Taney&quot; served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; in March and April 1960. A unique honor occurred on 27 April 1960 when &quot;Taney&quot;, as the senior U.S. ship present, hosted French President Charles de Gaulle on his tour of San Francisco Bay. She then served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; in August 1960. She served again on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; in January and then from May to June 1961.

==1965–1966==
On 1 May 1965 the Treasury-class vessels were re-designated as High Endurance Cutters or WHEC. This designation indicated a multi-mission ship able to operate at sea for 30–45 days without support and &quot;Taney&quot; was then re-classified as WHEC-37. In March 1965 she conducted an Alaskan Patrol and on 29 March she successfully fought a fire on board the disabled fishing vessel &quot;Glacier Bear&quot; south of Cape Fairweather and then towed her to safety. In May 1965, off northern California, she kept the Soviet refrigerator ship &quot;Chernjakhovsk&quot; under close surveillance.

In 1966 &quot;Taney&quot; undertook a 90-day &quot;Double VICTOR Cruise&quot;. She departed Alameda on 26 August and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 September, where she refueled before steaming to Honolulu, mooring at Berth 8. She departed Honolulu on 3 September en route to &quot;Ocean Station Victor&quot; via Midway Island, arriving at the latter on 6 September, departing the same day. On 8 September 1966 &quot;Taney&quot; crossed the 180th meridian and then arrived at &quot;Ocean Station Victor&quot; on 11 September, relieving USCGC &quot;Chautauqua&quot; (WHEC-41). She served on &quot;Victor&quot; until relieved by USCGC &quot;Winnebago&quot; (WHEC-40) on 1 October, then steamed towards Yokosuka, Japan. Here the crew enjoyed liberty before again heading back to the ocean station. She arrived at &quot;Victor&quot; on 22 October, relieving &quot;Winnebago&quot;. On 4 November Typhoon Marie passed close aboard &quot;Taney&quot;, with winds gusting close to 70 knots (130 km/h), but she weathered the storm without damage. On 12 November 1966 &quot;Taney&quot; was relieved again by &quot;Winnebago&quot; and she then steamed to Midway Island to refuel before heading back to Alameda, arriving there on 20 November.

==1968–1971==
The &quot;Taney&quot; served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; from 7 to 28 January 18 February to 10 March 21 April to 12 May and 27 October to 17 November 1968. Her final assignment to &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; was from 19 January to 9 February 1969. She was then ordered for duty with Coast Guard Squadron Three which was supporting the Navy&#x27;s Operation Market Time patrols off the coast of Vietnam. There &quot;Taney&quot; served a 10-month tour of duty, providing naval gunfire support and preventing enemy infiltration along the coastal routes used by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces.

She departed U.S. waters in April 1969 and arrived in theater on 14 May 1969 and she served in the area until 31 January 1970. During her tour of duty, &quot;Taney&quot; steamed for over and inspected over 1,000 vessels. She participated in dozens of naval gunfire support missions, firing more than 3,400 five-inch (127 mm) shells at Viet Cong positions. Her medical staff also treated over 6,000 Vietnamese villagers. For her service, the government of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) awarded &quot;Taney&quot; the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm and the Vietnam Civil Actions Medal with palm. After departing Vietnamese waters, she arrived at Alameda in February 1970.

After returning to U.S. waters, she once again began serving on ocean stations. From 30 August to 20 September 1970 and from 3 to 24 January 1971 she served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot;. From 28 March to 18 and 9 April to 30 May 1971 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Victor&quot;. She served on &quot;Ocean Station November&quot; from 22 August to 12 September and again from 24 October to 14 November 1971.

==1972–1986==

In February 1972 &quot;Taney&quot; was shifted back to the east coast and was homeported at Norfolk. From 2 September 1972 to 23 September 1972 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Hotel&quot;. Again from 13 to 22 October 1972 she conducted another &quot;Ocean Station Hotel&quot;. From 28 October to 17 November 1972 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Delta&quot;. From 26 January to 15 February. From 17 April to 7 May 1973 she served on &quot;Ocean Station Bravo&quot;. As the ocean stations were decommissioned during the early 1970s due to advances in radar and electronic navigation, &quot;Taney&quot; was assigned exclusively to the only station still operational: &quot;Ocean Station Hotel&quot; off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. Fitted with a special storm-tracking antenna housed in a distinctive bulbous dome fitted atop her pilot house, &quot;Taney&quot; deployed seven times yearly, conducting 21 deployments off the coast. This last ocean station had been established to track storms threatening the middle states on the east coast which had often struck without warning. Eventually, the use of more sophisticated storm-tracking satellites and radars rendered this station obsolete. Hence, &quot;Ocean Station Hotel&quot; was closed down in 1977 and the &quot;Taney&quot; gained the distinction of being the last Coast Guard cutter to serve on an ocean station.

The mid-1970s were a period of transition for the Coast Guard with the passage of the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act and the nation&#x27;s shift towards increased interdiction of narcotics smugglers. These operations called for off-shore patrols of up to three weeks. From September 1976 through her decommissioning she was stationed at Portsmouth, Virginia and began law enforcement and search and rescue patrols.

In December 1976 she assisted the sailboat &quot;Capella&quot; off New York. In December 1979 &quot;Taney&quot; helped seize the F/V &quot;Eneida&quot; for narcotics violations.

The month of January, 1980, was an unusually busy month for the crew of the &quot;Taney&quot;. On 10 January 1980, while underway on drug enforcement patrol duty, she was diverted to a Search and Rescue mission involving a lost Cessna 441 jet with two passengers. On 15 January 1980, she seized the M/V &quot;Ameila Isle&quot; east of Fort Pierce, Florida, carrying 4 tons of contraband. She continued south for additional drug enforcement patrol throughout the Caribbean region. Including a patrol break in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The month concluded with Fishery Patrol off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. In December 1980 she seized the British-flagged M/V &quot;Party Doll&quot; which was carrying 10 tons of contraband. Despite being the long arm of the law at sea she continued in her traditional Coast Guard humanitarian mission of search and rescue as well. On 16 November 1982, she rescued seven persons from the disabled ketch &quot;Klarwasser&quot; off the coast of North Carolina and rescued 19 migrants off the sailboat &quot;Apre Dien Ni&quot;. In May 1985 she assisted the disabled F/V &quot;Northwind&quot; off New York. She also continued nabbing drug smugglers. On 30 September 1984, she seized the P/C &quot;Thriller&quot; in the Yucatán Channel, carrying 1,000 pounds of marijuana. Her final bust occurred on 4 October 1985 when she seized the M/V &quot;Sea Maid I&quot; which was towing a barge that carried 160 tons of marijuana off Virginia.

==Fate==

She was decommissioned on 7 December 1986 and turned over to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, for use as a museum ship. Over her distinguished career, &quot;Taney&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service and numerous theater ribbons for service in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam War.

In 1988, the USCGC &quot;Taney&quot; (WHEC-37), Structure – #88001826, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. She was designated a National Historic Landmark on the same day. The &quot;Taney&quot; is located in the historic Baltimore Inner Harbor as part of the Historic Ships in Baltimore collection. &quot;Taney&quot; is included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

<doc id="692075" wikidata="Q513120" url="?curid=692075" title="Vernon Richards">
<text>Vernon Richards (born Vero Benvenuto Costantino Recchioni, 19 July 1915 – 10 December 2001) was an Anglo-Italian anarchist, editor, author, engineer, photographer, and companion of Marie-Louise Berneri.

Richards&#x27; founding of the paper &quot;Spain and the World&quot; in 1936 lead to the revival of the British anarchist publisher Freedom Press and the subsequent publishing of the newspaper &quot;War Commentary&quot;, followed in 1945 by the relaunch of &quot;Freedom&quot; newspaper.

Richards and Berneri were joined in Freedom Press by a group of regular contributors including John Hewetson, Tony Gibson, Philip Sansom, George Woodcock and Colin Ward. &quot;Freedom&quot; remained under Richards&#x27; editorship until 1968 and he retained a strong influence over Freedom Press until his retirement. He also authored and translated a number of books including &quot;Lessons of the Spanish Revolution&quot; (1953) and &quot;Errico Malatesta: His Life &amp; Ideas&quot; (1965).

== Biography ==
Richards was born in 1915 in Soho, London to the Italian militant anarchist railway worker Emidio Recchioni and his wife Costanza (&quot;née&quot; Benericetti) where they ran a popular delicatessen, &quot;King Bomba&quot;. Emidio had fled Italy following a prison escape with Errico Malatesta. Friends speculated that Richards inherited his single-mindedness from his father, though Richards later described his father as a &quot;bourgeois terrorist&quot;.

Richards was educated at Emanuel School in Wandsworth and studied civil engineering at King&#x27;s College London. He then worked as a railway engineer.

In 1931 in Paris Richards met Marie Louise Berneri, daughter of Camillo and Giovanna Berneri, and began a long-distance relationship. Richards and Camillo together edited the bilingual Italian and English anti-Mussolini paper &quot;Italia Libera&quot;/&quot;Free Italy&quot;, resulting in Richards&#x27; deportation from France in 1935.

In 1935, he anglicised his name from Vero Recchioni to Vernon Richards. From December 1936 Richards began work on a new anarchist newspaper in London, &quot;Spain and the World&quot;, reporting on the Spanish Civil War. In 1937 Marie moved to London to join him, marrying him in October 1937 so she could gain British citizenship.

After the first issue of &quot;Spain and the World&quot; the paper was taken on by Freedom Press with Richards&#x27; as editor, going on to play a leading role in the revival of British anarchism and Freedom Press.

Following the fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War &quot;Spain and the World&quot; was briefly relaunched as &quot;Revolt!&quot; In November 1939 with the onset of war the paper was renamed again as &quot;War Commentary&quot;.

On 26 April 1945 as an editor of &quot;War Commentary&quot; Richards was sentenced to nine months in prison along with two contributors, John Hewetson and Philip Sansom, for conspiring to cause disaffection among members of the armed forces under Defence Regulation 39a. The same charges against Berneri were dropped as legally a wife could not be prosecuted for conspiring with her husband – about which she was reportedly furious. Coming at the end of the war, the four day trial at the Old Bailey saw significant press coverage and public controversy. The arrests led to the formation of the prominent Freedom Defence Committee. The trial also saw an end to Richard&#x27;s career as an engineer, with Richards&#x27; and Berneri deciding to try and earn a living as professional photographers.

After Richards&#x27; release from prison their friend George Orwell, who was extremely averse to being photographed, allowed Richards and Berneri to photograph him to help them start out. The photos feature a relaxed Orwell at home and in the street and remain in widespread use. The complete set was published in the 1998 book &quot;George Orwell at Home (and Among the Anarchists): Essays and Photographs&quot;.

At this time a split had formed within Freedom Press between anarcho-syndicalists with ties to the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and anarcho-communists associated with Richards and Berneri who aligned more with Errico Malatesta&#x27;s critique of revolutionary trade unionism. The split saw the painter and &quot;War Commentary&quot; contributor Cliff Holden hold Richards at gunpoint to extract money for a new paper. Richards&#x27; views on the Spanish Civil War, including critiques of the CNT from &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Spain and the World&quot; were later republished in the book &quot;Lessons of the Spanish Revolution&quot;.

In December 1948 Berneri gave birth, but the child died shortly afterwards. She then died of a viral infection from childbirth in April 1949.

In the 1950s Richards sold the family store, &quot;King Bomba&quot;, and in 1968 with his partner Peta Hewetson he moved to Suffolk where he grew and sold vegetables from a smallholding. He also worked as a travel agent, including trips to Francoist Spain and the Soviet Union.

Richards formally retired from Freedom Press in 1995. A workaholic, he continued to write books into his eighties, though following Peta Hewetson&#x27;s death in 1997 he became more reclusive. He died on 10 December 2001 in Hadleigh, Suffolk.

In a &quot;Guardian&quot; obituary Colin Ward, who had worked with Richards for decades, described him as a &quot;ruthless exploiter of others&quot; and a &quot;manipulator&quot; with a noted tendency to lose friends. Richard&#x27;s papers are held by the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.

<doc id="692076" wikidata="Q7607464" url="?curid=692076" title="William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley">
<text>William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley (1426 – 14 February 1492) was an English peer, given the epithet &quot;The Waste-All&quot; by the family biographer and steward John Smyth of Nibley. He was buried at &quot;St. Augustine&#x27;s Friars, London&quot; according to one source, but most likely in the Berkeley family foundation of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Bristol.

==Descent and Marriages==
William of Berkley was born to James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley, and Lady Isabel Mowbray at Berkeley Castle in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, in 1426. His first marriage was in 1466 to Elizabeth West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr, but he obtained a divorce on 20 November 1467. In November 1468, he married Joan Strangeways, daughter of Sir Thomas Strangeways and Lady Katherine Neville. After the death of his second wife, he married Anne Fiennes, sister of Thomas Fiennes, 8th Baron Dacre, in .

==Titles==
William was invested as a knight . William assumed the title of Baron Berkeley by writ after the death of his father James Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley on 22 October 1463.

He was invested as a Knight Bachelor on 18 April 1475. He was styled as Viscount of Catherlough (now known as County Carlow, Ireland) between 1481 and 10 February 1485.

William was created Viscount Berkeley on 21 April 1481, as a Privy Counsellor (PC) on 5 March 1482/83, and as Earl of Nottingham on 28 June 1483. He assumed the life office of Earl Marshal and Great Marshal of England on 19 February 1485/86. Finally, he was created Marquess of Berkeley on 28 January 1488/89.

==Disinherits brother==
He had no surviving male issue, thus the marquessate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death, but he had a younger brother, Maurice Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley. He disinherited Maurice, as having brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying, beneath his status, to Isabel Mead, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxall, an alderman and mayor of Bristol in 1459, 1462 and 1469. 

In order to achieve this, the castle, lands and lordships composing the Barony of Berkeley he settled on King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to his own rightful heirs. Thus, in 1553 on the death of King Edward VI, the unmarried grandson of Henry VII, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family. Therefore, on the death of the 1st Marquis, only the &quot;de jure&quot; barony title was passed on to his younger brother Maurice, that is to say, he was Baron Berkeley &quot;by right&quot;, if not actually in possession of the baronial property. The 4th, 5th and 6th barons were also &quot;de jure&quot; only, with Henry (d. 1613) becoming &quot;de facto&quot; 7th Baron in 1553.

==Accomplishments==
On 20 March 1469/70, he was challenged by Thomas Talbot, 2nd Viscount Lisle, to settle the claims to his great-uncle Thomas&#x27;s estates by combat. Thomas was killed in the combat. The battle, known as the Battle of Nibley Green, is notable for being the last battle fought in England entirely between the private armies of feudal magnates.

<text>John Philip Jacob Elkann (born 1 April 1976) is an Italian industrialist. In 1997, he became the chosen heir of his maternal grandfather Gianni Agnelli, following the death of Gianni&#x27;s nephew Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, and since 2004 has been leading the Agnelli family, an Italian multi-industry business dynasty. The family has been compared to the US political family of the Kennedys.

Elkann chairs the automaker Stellantis and is the chief executive officer (CEO) of Exor, the holding company controlled by the Agnelli family, which also holds a controlling stake in Ferrari, CNH Industrial, Iveco Group, Juventus FC, and The Economist Group. In July 2018, he was appointed chairman of Ferrari after Sergio Marchionne left due to health issues. In 2021, Elkann oversaw the merger between Fiat Chrysler and the PSA Group. He is the leader of a group that controls 14 brands, with production sites in 29 countries, employs 400,000 people, and is present in over 130 markets.

== Early life and family ==
Born in New York City on 1 April 1976, Elkann held both Italian and American citizenship; he renounced the latter in 2012. He is the eldest son of Alain Elkann, a New York-born journalist and writer of French-Jewish (the Elkann surname comes from Montbéliard in France where his paternal grandfather was from) and Italian-Jewish background, and his then Italian wife Margherita Agnelli. His parents divorced in 1981 and both have remarried. Elkann&#x27;s maternal grandparents were the head of Fiat S.p.A., Gianni Agnelli, and the socialite Marella Agnelli (born &quot;Donna&quot; Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto); his great-grandfather was the industrialist Edoardo Agnelli, and his great-great-grandfather was Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat S.p.A. His paternal great-grand-uncle was the banker Ettore Ovazza. He has a brother, Lapo Elkann, and a sister, Ginevra Elkann, as well as five half-siblings from his mother&#x27;s second marriage, as Margherita Agnelli de Pahlen, to Serge de Pahlen. His younger half-siblings are Maria (born 1983), Pierre (born 1986), twins Sophie and Anna (born 1988), and Tatiana (born 1990).

Elkann attended primary school in both the United Kingdom and Brazil, before his family moved to Paris, where he obtained a &quot;baccalauréat scientifique&quot; at the State School Lycée Victor-Duruy in 1994. Later that same year, he moved to Italy to attend the Polytechnic University of Turin, where he graduated with a degree in management engineering in 2000; his thesis was entirely dedicated to e-commerce and online auctions. Among the people who have influenced his education and career, supporting him in his professional journey from a young age, John Elkann has cited Gianluigi Gabetti, Sergio Marchionne, Warren Buffett, and the Wallenberg family. As a result of his international upbringing, he is fluent in four languages: Italian, English, French, and Portuguese.

== Career ==
While pursuing a degree in engineering, Elkann gained work experience through several internships. They included a headlight plant in Birmingham, England (1996); a production line in Tychy, Poland (1997); a car dealership in Lille, France (1998); and at General Electric&#x27;s corporate initiatives group where he worked on a thesis on e-auctions (1999). In December 1997, at the age of 21, he was selected as the heir of his grandfather Gianni Agnelli in place of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, the son of Gianni&#x27;s younger brother, Umberto Agnelli, who had died at the age of 33. He was appointed to the Fiat S.p.A. board that same year, when he was 22, the same age his grandfather Gianni also joined it in 1943, and to the board of Giovanni Agnelli Sapaz (now Giovanni Agnelli B.V.), the family partnership controlling Exor.

In 2000, after graduating in Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin, he joined General Electric&#x27;s Corporate Audit program. He left General Electric two years later; Elkann described his work at General Electric as &quot;a beautiful experience, because you sit around a table where no one speaks your language and two out of three come from another continent.&quot; He moved back to Turin to be closer to his ageing grandfather, as well as to the family business. In 2003, Elkann joined IFIL, which later became Exor, where he was in charge of control and development, and was in particular responsible for supervising Rinascente and Alpitour. Elkann worked on the turnaround of Fiat Group. He was instrumental in the appointment of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) CEO Sergio Marchionne in May 2004.

After the death of Gianni in 2003, which was followed by that of Elkann&#x27;s great-uncle Umberto Agnelli in 2004, Elkann became vice-chairman of Fiat and vice-chairman of Giovanni Agnelli Sapaz. Franzo Grande Stevens and Gianluigi Gabetti were instrumental in the appointment of Elkann. In 2008, Elkann was seen as &quot;the great unknown&quot;, and he replaced 83-year-old Gabetti as the head of IFIL, which managed a portfolio worth eight billion euros. In March 2009, he merged the holding companies IFI and IFIL to create Exor, stepping to the role of chairman. In 2010, he became chairman of Fiat S.p.A. (then FCA), succeeding Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, and chairman of the Giovanni Agnelli Sapaz, succeeding Gabetti; at the time, Fiat had changed four CEOs in three years. Before this appointment, he mainly played a background role at Fiat. &quot;The Financial Times&quot; called Elkann&#x27;s appointment &quot;a confirmation of change that could prove to be the making of a new Fiat and also of the Agnelli family&#x27;s future fortunes.&quot;

In February 2011, Elkann was appointed chairman and CEO of Exor. The value of the company&#x27;s assets has grown and multiplied nine times in ten years. Since 2017, Elkann became chairman of Ferrari, GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, and the , a philanthropic institution supporting education. He is an active member of several non-profit organizations and think tanks engaged in the global geopolitical debate, one of the founders of the Collège des Ingénieurs Italia, and a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. A member of the Confindustria presidential committee, he followed Fiat&#x27;s decision to leave the group and resigned from his role as vice-chairman in October 2011, three months before Fiat&#x27;s official departure in January 2012, &quot;in the interests of the Association&#x27;s autonomy and independence&quot;, as written in his resignation letter to then-president Emma Marcegaglia. In a 2013 interview to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Elkann identified Bill Ford Jr. as a mentor. That same year, he was included by &quot;Fortune&quot; in the world&#x27;s most influential managers under the age of 40.
In a November 2013 interview to &quot;Campden FB&quot;, Elkann said he wanted to change capitalism. He said: &quot;There is an alternative to financial investors and professional investment managers, and that&#x27;s what we want to be. You need to be able to portray business to society in a favourable way. All the emphasis has been on shareholder value, not stakeholder value. One of the benefits of family businesses is they focus on all stakeholders.&quot; Guido Corbetta, a professor at Bocconi University in Milan and a family business expert, said that one of the biggest achievements at Exor was the management of the succession to Elkann from his grandfather. Corbetta said: &quot;He was dominant. Anyone succeeding him would have huge shoes to fill. But the fact that Elkann has done so and managed to beat his own path, distancing himself a lot from his grandfather&#x27;s particular style of running businesses and being successful, is a great achievement for Fiat, the Agnelli family, and even more so Elkann.&quot; In 2015, Elkann acquired the insurer company PartnerRe and took part at Ferrari’s debut as a listed company in stock exchange in Wall Street.

Having previously held a seat on Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp board and an inherited seat on the board of RCS Media Group, Elkann acquired a majority stake in The Economist Group in 2015; he was described as the opposite of fellow media mogul Silvio Berlusconi. In June 2017, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italian newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;, which was acquired by the Agnelli family in 1926, he organized an international conference, &quot;The Future of Newspapers&quot;, which was attended by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and other media representatives, such as Lionel Barber, Zanny Minton Beddoes, Mark Thompson, and Robert Thomson. Under Elkann&#x27;s management, Exor purchased the controlling stake in GEDI Gruppo Editoriale from CIR Group for $113 million in 2019; GEDI is the owner of two of Italy&#x27;s most influential newspapers, namely the Rome-based, liberal-leaning &quot;La Repubblica&quot; and the centrist, Turin-based &quot;La Stampa&quot;.

In July 2018, a few days before the death of Marchionne, Elkann was chosen to take his place at Ferrari. In 2019, Elkann announced he would be trying to merge FCA with Peugeot S.A. (PSA Group), with the goal of forming the world&#x27;s fourth largest OEM by volume and third largest by revenues, and catch up on electric cars, as well as autonomous vehicles. In May 2019, he tried to also enlist Renault. In December 2019, it was announced that FCA and Peugeot had reached an agreement to merge. In July 2020, he and FCA&#x27;s CEO Mike Manley announced that the name of the combined company would be Stellantis.

In March 2020, Elkann and FCA&#x27;s board of directors agreed to forego their remaining compensation for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Between December 2020 and September 2021, following the resignation of Louis Camilleri, he held the position of CEO of Ferrari until the appointment of Benedetto Vigna. In May 2021, Elkann was nominated Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour in the automotive industry by Italy&#x27;s president Sergio Mattarella. In 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be around US$2 billion.

In two January 2023 interviews to &quot;La Repubblica&quot; and &quot;La Stampa&quot;, in remembrance of the twenty years since Gianni&#x27;s death, Elkann said: &quot;If we compare the company in 2003 and today&#x27;s we see that revenues go from 22 billion to 130 in the first nine months of 2022 alone; there were 22 car models produced then, which employed 49,000 people, for 4 brands: today 280,000 people produce over 100 models for 14 brands. We have enhanced the Fiat brand, so much so that next year the electric 500 will also be exported to the USA. We have relaunched the Maserati and Alfa Romeo brands and we are relaunching Lancia. Furthermore, today we produce in Italy and sell models of highly successful non-Italian brands, such as Jeep, all over the world.&quot; On 15 May 2023 he announced as a founder the launch of Lingotto, an investment management company fully owned by Exor and headquartered in London. 

In January 2025, Elkann was appointed a board director at Meta Platforms.

The project was funded through external donations, through the Stellantis Foundation as the main supporter.

<text>Historic Ships in Baltimore, created as a result of the merger of the USS Constellation Museum and the Baltimore Maritime Museum, is a maritime museum located in the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, Maryland in the United States.
The museum&#x27;s collection includes four historic museum ships and one lighthouse:

* USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, a sloop-of-war; the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy
* WHEC-37, a Coast Guard cutter; the last surviving vessel that participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor
* USS &quot;Torsk&quot; (SS-423), a World War II-era submarine; credited with the last sinking of an enemy ship by the USN in that war
* &quot;Chesapeake&quot; (LV-116), a lightship; stationed at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay for most of her 40-year service life
* Seven Foot Knoll Light, a screw-pile lighthouse

All are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The four ships are also National Historic Landmarks.

The Liberty ship SS John W. Brown is also homeported out of Baltimore.

Historic Ships in Baltimore is an affiliate of the Living Classrooms Foundation.

<text>Thomas Gibson (born July 3, 1962) is an American actor and director. He is best known for his television roles as Aaron Hotchner on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (2005–2016), Greg Montgomery on &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; (1997–2002) and Daniel Nyland on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994–1997).

==Early life==
Gibson was born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Charles M. and Beth Gibson. His mother was a social worker, and his father was a lawyer and liberal Democrat who served in the South Carolina state Senate and House. He is Catholic. Gibson&#x27;s interest in the performing arts began at a young age. Gibson was fascinated by Louis Armstrong. He and his sister were on a swim team together, and they frequented a pizza parlor after their swim meets. It was at this pizza parlor that Gibson would sing along with a Dixieland band, complete with his attempt to impersonate Armstrong&#x27;s singing voice.

As a child, Gibson enrolled in Little Theater School and later graduated from Bishop England High School. He then attended the College of Charleston (1979–1981) and became an intern at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, where he was encouraged to apply to the Juilliard School. After a year and a half at Charleston, Gibson won a scholarship to Juilliard&#x27;s Drama Division (&quot;Group 14&quot;: 1981–1985), where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1985.

==Career==
Gibson started acting when he was nine years old, in children&#x27;s theater. He appeared in Julian Wiles&#x27; &quot;Seize the Street: the Skateboard Musical&quot;, a Young Charleston Theater Company (now Charleston Stage) production. As a teenager, he began his classical theater training by becoming a member of the Young Charleston Theater Company and the Footlight Players, often performing at the historic Dock Street Theatre. During his time at College of Charleston, Gibson was an intern at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. Gibson made his stage debut in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;A Map of the World&quot; in the New York Shakespeare Festival. He subsequently appeared in more plays for producer Joe Papp, both in Public Theater and in Central Park. He worked on and off Broadway for the next 10 years in a range of plays by Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Molière, Tennessee Williams, Howard Brenton, Romulus Linney, Noël Coward, and Alan Ball. Gibson also waited tables at Tavern on the Green.

Gibson&#x27;s first television appearance was in 1987, in a guest role on the legal drama &quot;Leg Work&quot;, followed by stints on the daytime dramas &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;. In 1992, Gibson made his movie debut in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Far and Away&quot;, in which he portrayed Stephen Chase. Chase was the villainous rival of Joseph Donnelly (Tom Cruise) for Shannon Christie&#x27;s (Nicole Kidman) affections. His next lead role was in 1993 as David, a gay waiter, in Denys Arcand&#x27;s &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot;. Also in 1993, he played bisexual businessman misanthrope Beauchamp Day in the television version of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the City&quot; (1993). At the time, &quot;Tales of the City&quot; was highly controversial for its gay, transgender, bisexual, and drag-queen characters along with nudity, sexual situations, drug use, and explicit language. Gibson later reunited with Arcand in &quot;Stardom&quot; (2000). In 1999, Gibson had a supporting role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s final film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, where he was reunited with Cruise and Kidman. Gibson then returned to television, portraying Dr. Danny Nyland on the medical drama &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; from 1994 to 1998. From 1997 to 2002, Gibson portrayed Greg Montgomery in the sitcom &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, for which he was nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award. After &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, Gibson appeared in various TV movies.

===&quot;Criminal Minds&quot; ===
In 2005, Gibson was cast as Supervisory Special Agent Aaron &quot;Hotch&quot; Hotchner, the unit chief of the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), in the series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.

Gibson directed six episodes of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; beginning in 2013 (in 2001, he directed two last-season episodes of &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;). Gibson had a prior altercation with an assistant director and had undergone anger-management counseling at that time.

On August 11, 2016, Gibson was suspended (after appearing in two episodes of the 12th season of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;) following an on-set altercation with writer-producer Virgil Williams; he apologized for the confrontation in a statement, claiming the dispute arose from creative differences in an episode he was directing.

The following day, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios (which co-distribute &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;) issued a statement announcing that Gibson&#x27;s contract with the series had been terminated. The statement included the information that his character&#x27;s exit story from the series had yet to be determined. In the October 12, 2016, episode &quot;Taboo&quot;, the absence of Gibson&#x27;s character is explained as being away on special assignment; however, in the episode &quot;Elliot&#x27;s Pond&quot;, it is revealed that he resigned and went into the Witness Protection Program after noticing a serial killer stalking his son.

==Personal life==
Gibson resided in San Antonio, Texas, and has a house on Sullivan&#x27;s Island, South Carolina, which he frequents. Gibson has three children including his son, Travis Carter, who was featured in the Season 10 episode &quot;Boxed In&quot; (#5) of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; as a friend of a kidnapped child. Gibson and his wife Christine separated in 2011, and he filed for divorce in 2014. The divorce was final on February 14, 2018.

Gibson enjoys golf. He plays at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am every year, as well as other golfing events, and is friends with golfer Corey Pavin. He was part of the 2010 Host Committee for the Inaugural SAG Foundation Golf Classic, and he co-hosted the 2nd Annual SAG Foundation Golf Classic with &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; castmate Joe Mantegna.

<text>The Oxford University Museum of Natural History (OUMNH) is a museum displaying many of the University of Oxford&#x27;s natural history specimens, located on Parks Road in Oxford, England. It also contains a lecture theatre which is used by the university&#x27;s chemistry, zoology and mathematics departments. The museum provides the only public access into the adjoining Pitt Rivers Museum.

==History==

The university&#x27;s Honour School of Natural Science started in 1850, but the facilities for teaching were scattered around the city of Oxford in the various colleges. The university&#x27;s collection of anatomical and natural history specimens were similarly spread around the city. Regius Professor of Medicine, Sir Henry Acland, initiated the construction of the museum between 1855 and 1860, to bring together all the aspects of science around a central display area. The building was officially opened in 1860, although various departments had occupied their premises from as early as 1858. In 1858, Acland gave a lecture on the museum, setting forth the reason for the building&#x27;s construction. He viewed that the university had been one-sided in the forms of study it offered—chiefly theology, philosophy, the classics and history—and that the opportunity should be offered to learn of the natural world and obtain the &quot;knowledge of the great material design of which the Supreme Master-Worker has made us a constituent part&quot;. This idea, of Nature as the Second Book of God, was common in the 19th century.

The largest portion of the museum&#x27;s collections consist of the natural history specimens from the Ashmolean Museum, including the specimens collected by John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name, William Burchell and geologist William Buckland. The Christ Church Museum donated its osteological and physiological specimens, many of which were collected by Acland. The construction of the building was accomplished through money earned from the sale of Bibles. Several departments moved within the building—astronomy, geometry, experimental physics, mineralogy, chemistry, geology, zoology, anatomy, physiology and medicine. As the departments grew in size over the years, they moved to new locations along South Parks Road, which remains the home of the university&#x27;s Science Area.

The last department to leave the building was the entomology department, which moved into the zoology building in 1978. However, there is still a working entomology laboratory on the first floor of the museum building. Between 1885 and 1886 a new building to the east of the museum was constructed to house the ethnological collections of General Augustus Pitt Rivers—the Pitt Rivers Museum. In 19th-century thinking, it was very important to separate objects made by the hand of God (natural history) from objects made by the hand of man (anthropology).

The museum is being renovated and the layout being changed between 2023 and 2024.

==The building==

The neo-Gothic building was designed by the Irish architects Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward, mostly Woodward. The museum&#x27;s design was directly influenced by the writings of critic John Ruskin, who involved himself by making various suggestions to Woodward during construction. Construction by Lucas Brothers began in 1855, and the building was ready for occupancy in 1860.

The adjoining building that houses the Pitt Rivers Museum was the work of Thomas Manly Deane, son of Thomas Newenham Deane. It was built between 1885 and 1886.

The museum consists of a large square court with a glass roof, supported by cast iron pillars, which divide the court into three aisles. Cloistered arcades run around the ground and first floor of the building, with stone columns each made from a different British stone, selected by geologist John Phillips (the Keeper of the Museum). The ornamentation of the stonework and iron pillars incorporates natural forms such as leaves and branches, combining the Pre-Raphaelite style with the scientific role of the building.

Statues of eminent men of science stand around the ground floor of the court—from Aristotle and Bacon through to Darwin and Linnaeus. Although the university paid for the construction of the building, the ornamentation was funded by public subscription, and much of it remains incomplete. The Irish stone carvers O&#x27;Shea and Whelan had been employed to create lively freehand carvings in the Gothic manner. When funding dried up, they offered to work unpaid, but they were accused by members of the University Convocation of &quot;defacing&quot; the building by adding unauthorised work. According to Acland, the O&#x27;Shea brothers responded by caricaturing the members of Convocation as parrots and owls in the carving over the building&#x27;s entrance. Acland insists that he forced them to remove the heads from these carvings.

On 12 January 1954 both the Natural History and Pitt Rivers museums were Grade I listed as being &quot;one of the most significant and carefully detailed museum complexes of the mid-late C19, as well as being a seminal monument to Oxford&#x27;s scientific awakening.&quot;

==Significant events==

===The 1860 evolution debate===

A significant debate in the history of evolutionary biology took place in the museum in 1860 at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Representatives of the Church and science debated the subject of evolution, and the event is often viewed as symbolising the defeat of a literalist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative. However, there are few eye-witness accounts of the debate, and most accounts of the debate were written by scientists.

The biologist Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, are generally cast as the main protagonists in the debate. Huxley was a keen scientist and a staunch supporter of Darwin&#x27;s theories. Wilberforce had supported the construction of the museum as the centre for the science departments, for the study of the wonders of God&#x27;s creations.

On the Wednesday of the meeting, 27 June 1860, botanist Charles Daubeny presented a paper on plant sexuality, which made reference to Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection. Richard Owen, a zoologist who believed that evolution was governed by divine influence, criticised the theory pointing out that the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than that of other primates. Huxley stated that he would respond to this comment in print, and declined to continue the debate. However, rumours began to spread that the Bishop of Oxford would be attending the conference on the following Saturday.

Initially, Huxley was planning to avoid the bishop&#x27;s speech. However, evolutionist Robert Chambers convinced him to stay.

Wilberforce&#x27;s speech on 30 June 1860 was good-humoured and witty, but was an unfair attack on Darwinism, ending in the now infamous question to Huxley of whether &quot;it was through his grandfather or grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey.&quot; Some commentators suggested that this question was written by Owen, and others suggested that the bishop was taught by Owen. (Owen and Wilberforce had known each other since childhood.)

Wilberforce is purported to have turned to his neighbour, chemist Professor Brodie and exclaiming, &quot;The Lord has delivered him into mine hands.&quot; When Huxley spoke, he responded that he had heard nothing from Wilberforce to prejudice Darwin&#x27;s arguments, which still provided the best explanation of the origin of species yet advanced. He ended with the equally famous response to Wilberforce&#x27;s question, that he had &quot;no need to be ashamed of having an ape for his grandfather, but that he would be ashamed of having for an ancestor a man of restless and versatile interest who distracts the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digression and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.&quot;

However it seems unlikely that the debate was as spectacular as traditionally suggested – contemporary accounts by journalists do not make mention of the words that have become such notable quotations. Additionally, contemporary accounts suggest that it was not Huxley, but Sir Joseph Hooker who most vocally defended Darwinism at the meeting.

While all the accounts of the event suggest that the supporters of Darwinism were the most persuasive, it seems likely that the exact nature of the debate was made more sensational in the reports of Huxley&#x27;s supporters to encourage further support for Darwin&#x27;s theories.

===The 1894 demonstration of wireless telegraphy===
The first public demonstration of wireless telegraphy took place in the lecture theatre of the museum on 14 August 1894, carried out by Professor Oliver Lodge. A radio signal was sent from the neighbouring Clarendon Laboratory building, and received by apparatus in the lecture theatre.

===Charles Dodgson and the dodo===
The museum displays a 1651 painting of a dodo by Flemish artist, Jan Savery. Charles Dodgson, better known by his pen-name Lewis Carroll, was a regular visitor to the museum, and Savery&#x27;s painting is likely to have influenced the character of the Dodo in Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.
=== 2024 University of Oxford pro-Palestinian campus occupations ===

On the 6 May 2024 a Palestinian solidarity encampment was erected on the front lawn of the museum. This began the 2024 University of Oxford pro-Palestinian campus occupations.

==Collections==
The museum collections are divided into three sections: Earth Collections covering the Palaeontological collections and the mineral and rock collections, Life Collections which include zoological and entomological collections, and the Archive Collections.

The Hope Entomological Collections, numbering over five million specimens are held by the museum. The Hope Department was founded by Frederick William Hope and the first appointed curator of the collections was John Obadiah Westwood. Many important insect and arachnid specimens from various collectors and collections make up the museums holdings including (but not limited to) those of Octavius Pickard-Cambridge, George Henry Verrall, Pierre François Marie Auguste Dejean, Pierre André Latreille, Alfred Russel Wallace, Charles Darwin, Jacques Marie Frangile Bigot, and Pierre Justin Marie Macquart among others.

==The museum today==
The museum is led by a director ( Professor Paul Smith, formerly Head of the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham), who succeeded Professor Jim Kennedy in 2011, and there are front of house, education, outreach, IT, library, conservation, and technical staff.

Since 1997 the museum has benefited from external funding, from government and private sources, and undertaken a renewal of its displays. As well as central exhibits featuring the dodo and dinosaurs, there are sets of displays with contemporary designs but within restored Victorian cabinets, on a variety of themes: Evolution, Primates, the History of Life, Vertebrates, Invertebrates and Rocks and Minerals. There are also a number of popular touchable items, which include two bears, a fox, and other taxidermy. Additionally, there is a meteorite and large fossils and minerals. Visitors can also see large dinosaur reconstructions and a parade of mammal skeletons.
A famous group of ichnites (fossilised footprints) was found in a limestone quarry at Ardley, 20 km northeast of Oxford, in 1997. They were thought to have been made by &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and possibly &quot;Cetiosaurus&quot;. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the front lawn of the museum.

The tower of the museum is a popular nesting area for migrating swifts. Cameras have been installed which broadcast a live stream to a display near the main entrance.

On March 17, 2020, the museum shut indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It reopened with some restrictions on September 22, 2020.

The &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot; tree in front of the museum was 35.7m tall in 2006. As &quot;the tallest object in central Oxford&quot;, in 2024 the tree was fiited with a lightning rod to help protect it in the event of a lightning strike.

== Keepers, secretaries and directors ==


==In popular culture==

The Museum has been featured in several movies, television shows and documentaries.

Several scenes for the 2004 Animal Planet Docufiction film &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; (known in the United States as &quot;Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real&quot;) were filmed at the Oxford museum.

Various scenes were filmed around Oxford for the 2017 blockbuster science fiction Action sequel &quot;&quot;, one scene where Viviane Wembly is giving a tour to a group of students featuring Laura Haddock and Anthony Hopkins was shot in the university and museum.

Scenes were shot at the museum for the BBC One and HBO fantasy drama &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;.

A deleted scene for the Marvel Superhero film &quot;Eternals&quot; featuring Kit Harington and Lia McHugh was filmed at the museum.

<doc id="692099" wikidata="Q1796666" url="?curid=692099" title="Body surface area">
<text>In physiology and medicine, the body surface area (BSA) is the measured or calculated surface area of a human body. For many clinical purposes, BSA is a better indicator of metabolic mass than body weight because it is less affected by abnormal adipose mass. Nevertheless, there have been several important critiques of the use of BSA in determining the dosage of medications with a narrow therapeutic index, such as chemotherapy.

Typically there is a 4–10 fold variation in drug clearance between individuals due to differing the activity of drug elimination processes related to genetic and environmental factors. This can lead to significant overdosing and underdosing (and increased risk of disease recurrence). It is also thought to be a distorting factor in Phase I and II trials that may result in potentially helpful medications being prematurely rejected. The trend to personalized medicine is one approach to counter this weakness.

==Uses==
Examples of uses of the BSA:
* Renal clearance usually divided by the BSA i.e. per 1.73 m² to gain an appreciation of the true glomerular filtration rate (GFR);
* The Quetelet index uses a somewhat modified form of the BSA;
* The cardiac index is a measure of cardiac output divided by the BSA, giving a better approximation of the effective cardiac output;
* Chemotherapy is often dosed according to the patient&#x27;s BSA.
* Glucocorticoid dosing is also expressed in terms of BSA for calculating maintenance doses or to compare high dose use with maintenance requirement.

There is some evidence that BSA values are less accurate at extremes of height and weight, where Body Mass Index may be a better estimate (for hemodynamic parameters).

==Calculation==
Various calculations have been published to arrive at the BSA without direct measurement. In the following formulae, BSA is expressed in m2, weight (or, more properly, mass) W in kg, and height H in cm.

The most widely used is the Du Bois formula, which has been shown to be equally as effective in estimating body fat in obese and non-obese patients, something the Body mass index fails to do.

:formula_1

The Mosteller formula is also commonly used, and is mathematically simpler:

:formula_2

Other formulas for BSA in m2 include:

For any formula, the units should match. Mosteller pointed out that his formula holds only if the density is treated as a constant for all humans. Lipscombe, following Mosteller&#x27;s reasoning, observed that the formulas obtained by Fujimoto, Shuter and Aslani, Takahira, and Lipscombe are suggestive of formula_3, which is dimensionally correct for the case of constant density. It equals formula_4.

A weight-based formula that does not include a square root (making it easier to use) was proposed by Costeff and recently validated for the pediatric age group. It is [4W (kg) + 7]/[90 + W (kg)].

==Average values==
Average BSA for children of various ages, for men, and for women, can be estimated using statistical survey data and a BSA formula:
The estimations in the above tables are based weight and height data from the U.S. NCHS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2014).

There was an average BSA of for 3,000 cancer patients from 1990 to 1998 in a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) database.

During 2005 there was an average BSA of for 3,613 adult cancer patients in the UK. Among them the average BSA for men was and for women was .

<text>Oak Hill Country Club is a country club in the northeastern United States, located in the Town of Pittsford, New York, a suburb southeast of Rochester. Founded in 1901, and best known for its East golf course, the club has hosted multiple major championships. The club facilities are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The club has a rich history of golf, starting out in 1901 as only 9 holes on on the banks of the Genesee River in Rochester. The clubhouse was no more than a converted farm house. At the time, golf was a relatively new sport in America, and as popularity of the sport grew, so did the country club.

By 1921, Oak Hill had doubled in size and had a new clubhouse, so when the University of Rochester proposed a land swap in 1921, it was a tough decision for members. However, the country club decided to take the university up on their offer, and moved the club to a plot in nearby Pittsford.

This decision ended up benefiting Oak Hill, the University of Rochester, and the City of Rochester. Now with triple the land of the old country club, Oak Hill had room for two 18-hole courses. Designed by Donald Ross, they became the East Course and the West Course. Local physician and civic personality John Ralston Williams cultivated and planted tens of thousands of oak trees among the fairways and roughs on what once was a farmed-out field.

===East Course===
The East Course — which hosts the major tournaments — is built around the east branch of Allen Creek, which acts as a lateral hazard on 9 of its 18 holes. It has had several changes made over the years - first by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in the early 1960s, later (and more recently for the 1989 Open and 2003 PGA) by Tom Fazio and his design group and finally by Andrew Green who completed a restoration project in 2019.

In 1941, the &quot;Rochester Times-Union&quot;, a local paper at the time, posted a $5,000 purse which attracted the greatest golfers in the world, including names such as Sam Snead, Walter Hagen, and Ben Hogan. This tournament, won by Snead, put Oak Hill on the national golf map. Several prestigious tournaments were held at Oak Hill over the next 78 years, including seven men&#x27;s major championships – including three U.S. Opens and four PGA Championships, as well as the Ryder Cup.

In 2019, the East Course was ranked 22nd in &quot;Golf Digest&quot;&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s 100 Greatest Golf Courses.

<doc id="692101" wikidata="Q4079394" url="?curid=692101" title="Tomás Batista">
<text>Tomás Batista (born December 7, 1935) is a Puerto Rican sculptor. He is the creator of some of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most notable monuments.

==Early years==
Batista (birth name: Tomás Batista Encarnación) was born and raised in Luquillo, Puerto Rico, a town located in the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico. His family was poor, but he did well in school and finished high school. His family recognized that their son had talent as an artist at a young age. After graduating from high school, he moved to San Juan to continue his education. There he met and went to work with the Spanish artist, Ángel Botello. In 1955, while working with Botello, Batista discovered that he had a natural talent to work with the restoration process in wood. He learned from Botello the secrets of restoration and how to work with gold on wood. In 1957, he realized his first work of art, the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;.

In 1958, Batista was awarded a grant and studied sculpting at the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture under the direction of the Maestro Compostela. Batista also studied art in La Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes La Esmeralda in Mexico City, Mexico on a Guggenheim fellowship in 1960 and in the Instituto de Cultura Hispánica in Spain. In 1966, he was named director of the Department of Sculpture and Restoration of the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture. In 1972, Batista spent a year in Spain, where he created the busts of Eugenio María de Hostos and Ramón Emeterio Betances.

==Sculptures==
He created is Monumento al Jíbaro Puertorriqueño (Monument to the Common Puerto Rican Countryman) in Cayey. In this monument Batista reflects the humbleness and hard working nature of the typical Puerto Rican farmer and his family. The monument is located by the Luis A. Ferré Highway in Cayey.

Among Batista&#x27;s other works are the sculptures of Julia de Burgos in Carolina, Hayuya in Jayuya, and Rafael Hernández in Bayamón. In 1993, he unveiled the monument of the Cacique Loguillo which is located in his hometown.

==Awards and recognition==
He received a second place prize in sculpture in &quot;Concurso Esso para Artistas Jóvenes&quot; held in San Juan in November 1964. His stone sculpture, &quot;Caracol,&quot; subsequently traveled to Washington, DC, where it was part of the Puerto Rican delegation in the Esso Salon of Young Artists, a contest held in 1965 for young Latin American artists sponsored by the Pan American Union and Esso. In 1976, he was named &quot;The Most Outstanding Young Man in Puerto Rico&quot; by the Junior Chamber of Commerce. In 1987 Batista was awarded the &quot;Medalla de la Orden del Quinto Centenario&quot; (&quot;Medal of the Order of the 5th Century&quot;), during the commemoration of Puerto Rico&#x27;s discovered by Christopher Columbus.

The City of Bayamón is the sponsor of Batista&#x27;s work with a permanent exposition in the Salón Batista. In 1991, a permanent exhibition of his works was also established in his native city of Luquillo. Tomás Batista&#x27;s works of art are found in museums in Puerto Rico, New York and Washington, D.C., and also in private collections. Batista currently travels around the island and abroad giving conferences about his art.

<doc id="692102" wikidata="Q6144512" url="?curid=692102" title="Earnest James Ujaama">
<text>Earnest James Ujaama (born 1966) is an American community activist and former terrorist. 

A long-term resident of Seattle and well-known community activist, Ujaama was arrested under terrorism charges in July 2002, the first American to be detained on US soil while under investigation using the Patriot Act. Amid conflicting reports and media coverage of the extent of his involvement in terrorist networks, he was convicted three times of various offences, in 2003, 2007, and 2015. He cooperated extensively with the government and testifed against other terrorists, and since 2015 has embarked upon an academic career.

== Early life ==
Ujaama was born James Earnest Thompson in Denver in 1966, and moved to Seattle at the age of 5. He was born a Catholic. His mother was a social worker at the Central Area Motivation Program. At the age of 9, Thompson began a business in raking leaves; at the age of 14, he started a business in home maintenance. Thompson studied at Ingraham High School. Before he graduated from high school, he enrolled in the University of Washington, but dropped out after two years. 

In the mid-1980s, Thompson moved to Pelican, Alaska, where he worked at a seafood company. At age 22, Thompson bought and ran a computer store in the University District of Seattle, renaming it Campus Computers. He sold it after six months. He worked for Olympic Computers selling IBM computers, but was accused of carrying out scams on his customers. He was later found to have never filed a tax return.

Thompson was a mentor working with gangs and trouble youth. He wrote the motivational book &quot;The Young People&#x27;s Guide to Starting a Business Without Selling Drugs&quot; and the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Coming Up&quot;, which were well received. He moved to Los Angeles to try to make his novel into a movie, without success. 

In the early 1990s, Thompson changed his name to Earnest James Ujaama; he had followed his brother Mustafa Ujaama – born Jon Thompson – who had converted to Islam earlier while in the military.

In 1993, Ujaama, funded by a grant from the city of Seattle, taught a class at Seattle Vocational Institute. Ujaama was invited to speak at the 1994 NAACP convention in Chicago. On June 10, 1994, then-state representative Jesse Wineberry declared it to be &quot;James Ujaama Day&quot; in the state of Washington.

== Conversion to Islam ==
In late 1996, Ujaama returned to Seattle, where he converted to Islam circa 1997. Ujaama then moved to London and studied under Jamaican-born cleric Abdullah el-Faisal. Moving between London and Seattle, Ujaama eventually started selling tapes of el-Faisal&#x27;s sermons, but kept the proceeds. While in London, Ujaama married a Muslim woman from Somalia. In late 1998, Ujaama spent two weeks in a jihad training camp in Afghanistan. Ujaama later studied under Abu Hamza al-Masri, attending the Finsbury Park Mosque. 

In late 1999, Ujaama returned to the United States, where he learned about a ranch in Bly, Oregon. That October, he traveled to the ranch, where he carried out firearm practice; he sent a fax to Abu Hamza al-Masri to promote this idea, but he greatly exaggerated his progress. He also drafted a flyer that said &quot;Get away from dunia [earthly matters] and be among Muslims!&quot;, advertising a cost of / (including airfare).

In November/December 1999, Oussama Kassir and Haroon Aswat (emissaries from Abu Hamza) came to Bly to inspect the property. (They arrived in New York City on an Air India flight on November 26, 1999; afterwards, they took a Greyhound bus to Seattle, and were then driven by Ujaama to Bly.) However, Kassir and Aswat realized upon their arrival that there was nothing in the ranch, and that Ujaama had been running a scam.

In January 2000, Ujaama moved back to London. From 2000 to 2001, Ujaama (under the alias Bilal Ahmed) operated the &quot;Supporters of Shariah&quot; website, which was used to advocate for &quot;violent jihad&quot;.

During this period, Ujaama was also known as Abu Samayya or Abdul Qaadir.

== Terrorism charges ==
On July 22 2002, Ujaama was arrested in Denver under a material witness warrant, becoming the first American to be detained on US soil while under investigation using the Patriot Act. He was charged by federal grand jury on August 28, 2002. The lead FBI agent in the case testified that he did not believe Ujaama needed to be locked up.

In 2003, Ujaama agreed to cooperate with US authorities in return for a plea deal, receiving two years in jail. He admitted that he had travelled to Afghanistan in 2000 to deliver money and computer equipment to the Taliban, a violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Ujaama agreed to testify against Abu Hamza, Oussama Kassir, and Haroon Aswat. All three were charged by prosecutors, but resisted extradition. The government dropped all other terrorism, conspiracy and firearms charges Ujaama had been indicted on. Scholar of Muslim-American history Edward E. Curtis later wrote, &quot;Some readers may regard the original indictment as evidence of the threat posed by Islamic terror; for others, it may be proof that the government is using or abusing the war on terror to prosecute its larger foreign policy objectives and domestic agendas.&quot;

In December 2006, after his release, Ujaama fled to Belize. On his return to the US, new charges of conspiring to provide and conceal material support or resources to terrorists, providing material support or resources to terrorists and unlawful flight to avoid giving testimony were brought, to which he again pled guilty. He was sentenced to four further years in jail. He cooperated with authorities, meeting with prosecutors over 70 times and eventually testifying at the trials of Oussama Kassir and Abu Hamza al-Masri.

On October 23, 2015, Ujaama was convicted for a third time at a US district court in Manhattan. He was sentenced to time served, with US attorney John P. Cronan calling his cooperation &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;largely unprecedented&quot;.

== Later life ==
Since 2015, Ujaama has worked as a trucker and travelled overseas. In a 2021 interview, he said the case against him was &quot;a farce&quot; and accused the US Justice Department of misrepresenting the camp he trained at by falsely linking it to al-Qaida. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel like I didn&#x27;t do anything immoral or wrong … I believed in what I was doing … All these things get turned around and twisted around.&quot;

In 2021, Ujaama received a PhD from the School of Criminal Justice at Walden University; his thesis is titled &quot;Modern Black Codes: Presidential Crime Control Rhetoric and Black Criminalization&quot;.

<doc id="692110" wikidata="Q944800" url="?curid=692110" title="Frottola">
<text>The frottola (; plural frottole) was the predominant type of Italian popular secular song of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. It was the most important and widespread predecessor to the madrigal. The peak of activity in composition of frottole was the period from 1470 to 1530, after which time the form was replaced by the madrigal.

While &quot;frottola&quot; is a generic term, several subcategories can be recognized, as would be expected of a musical form which was used for approximately a hundred years, maintaining immense popularity for more than half of that time. Most typically, a frottola is a composition for three or four voices (more towards the end of the period), with the uppermost voice containing the melody: instrumental accompaniments may have been used. The poem usually has a rhyme scheme of ABBA for a &quot;ripresa&quot; (reprise), and a stanza of CDCDDA or CDCDDEEA, though there is much variation between subtypes of frottola. Most likely the poetic forms are descended from the fourteenth-century ballata, though the music shows a startling simplification from late fourteenth-century practice.

Musically, the frottola avoids contrapuntal complexity, preferring homophonic textures, clear and repetitive rhythms, and a narrow melodic range. It was an important predecessor not only to the madrigal, but to much later practices in the Baroque era such as monody, since it anticipates chordal accompaniment, has the melody in the highest voice, and shows an early feeling for what later developed into functional harmony.

Very little is known about performance practice. Contemporary editions are sometimes for multiple voices, with or without lute tablature; occasionally keyboard scores survive. Frottole may have been performed as solo voice with lute accompaniment—certainly Marchetto Cara may have performed them this way at the Gonzaga court, as is implied by his renown as lutenist, singer, and composer of frottole—and they also may have been performed by other combinations of singers and instruments as well.

The most famous composers of frottola were Bartolomeo Tromboncino and Marchetto Cara, although some of the popular secular compositions of Josquin (for example &quot;Scaramella&quot; and &quot;El Grillo&quot;) are stylistically frottole, though not in name.

The frottola was a significant influence not only on the madrigal, but on the French chanson, which also tended to be a light, danceable, and popular form. Many French composers of the period went to Italy, either to work in aristocratic courts or at the papal chapel in Rome. While in Italy, they encountered the frottola, and incorporated some of what they heard in their native secular compositions.

==Composers==

Composers of frottole include:

* Francesco d&#x27;Ana
* Giovanni Brocco
* Antonio Caprioli
* Marchetto Cara
* Giacomo Fogliano
* Lodovico Fogliano
* Erasmus Lapicida
* Filippo de Lurano
* Rossino Mantovano
* Michele Pesenti
* Bartolomeo Tromboncino
* Michele Vicentino

Except for Tromboncino and Cara, who were extremely famous, very little is known about most of these composers; in many cases only their names survive, and those because Petrucci, the prominent Venetian publisher, included their names in collections containing their music.

<doc id="692112" wikidata="Q899390" url="?curid=692112" title="Vacuum ejector">
<text>A vacuum ejector, or simply ejector, or aspirator, is a type of vacuum pump, which produces vacuum by means of the Venturi effect.

In an ejector, a working fluid (liquid or gaseous) flows through a jet nozzle into a tube that first narrows and then expands in cross-sectional area. The fluid leaving the jet is flowing at a high velocity which due to Bernoulli&#x27;s principle results in it having low pressure, thus generating a vacuum. The outer tube then narrows into a mixing section where the high velocity working fluid mixes with the fluid that is drawn in by the vacuum, imparting enough velocity for it to be ejected, the tube then typically expands in order to decrease the velocity of the ejected stream, allowing the pressure to smoothly increase to the external pressure.

The strength of the vacuum produced depends on the velocity and shape of the fluid jet and the shape of the constriction and mixing sections, but if a liquid is used as the working fluid, the strength of the vacuum produced is limited by the vapor pressure of the liquid (for water, or 32 mbar at ). If a gas is used, however, this restriction does not exist.

If not considering the source of the working fluid, vacuum ejectors can be significantly more compact than a self-powered vacuum pump of the same capacity.

== Common types ==

===Water aspirator===
The cheap and simple water aspirator is commonly used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee fitting attached to a tap and has a hose barb at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the hose barb is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. In the past, water aspirators were common for low-strength vacuums in chemistry benchwork. However, they are water-intensive, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for (e.g. solvent removal), they can violate environmental protection laws such as the RCRA by mixing potentially hazardous chemicals into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer. Their use has decreased somewhat as small electric vacuum pumps are far more effective, environmentally safe, and have become more affordable, but the unmatched simplicity and reliability of this device have caused it to remain popular for small labs or as a backup.

Another, much larger version of this device is used in maritime operations as a device to dewater (drain) areas in a ship that have been flooded in emergency situations. Typically referred to as an eductor in these applications, this is preferred over electrical pumps due to their simplicity, compact size, and greatly mitigated risk of explosion in the event that flammable liquids and/or vapors are present. Additionally, unlike many mechanical pumps, they can also pass debris as the eductor has no moving parts that can be fouled. This makes an eductor especially useful in situations where fitting a debris strainer to the suction port will present more issues than it resolves. The size of the debris that can be passed depends on the physical size of the eductor. Sizes, flow ratings, and applications vary, including eductors that are permanently installed (typically used in very large spaces, such as a ship&#x27;s main engine room), or portable models that can be lowered into spaces by a rope and supplied and drained through firefighting hoses. Most are supplied through a ship&#x27;s firefighting main, and portable models can also be supplied by an emergency pump, provided it can supply sufficient flow to operate the eductor.

=== Steam ejector ===
The industrial steam ejector (also called the &quot;steam jet ejector&quot;, &quot;steam aspirator&quot;, or &quot;evactor&quot;) uses steam as a working fluid and multistage systems can produce very high vacuums. Due to the lack of delicate moving parts and the flow of steam providing somewhat of cleaning action, steam ejectors can handle gas flows containing liquids, dust, or even solid particles that would damage or clog many other vacuum pumps. Ejectors made entirely from specialised materials such as PTFE or graphite have allowed usage of extremely corrosive gasses, since steam ejectors have no moving parts they can be constructed in their entirety from almost any material that has sufficient durability.

In order to avoid using too much steam or impractical operating pressures, a single steam-ejector stage is generally not used to generate vacuum below approximately 10 kPa (75 mmHg). To generate higher vacuum, multiple stages are used; in a two-stage steam ejector, for example, the second stage provides vacuum for the waste steam output by the first stage. Condensers are typically used between stages to significantly reduce the load on the later stages. Steam ejectors with two, three, four, five and six stages may be used to produce vacuums down to 2.5 kPa, 300 Pa, 40 Pa, 4 Pa, and 0.4 Pa, respectively.

Steam ejectors are also suitable for pumping many liquids since if the steam can be easily condensed into the liquid then there is no need to separate the working fluid or manage a mist of liquid droplets. This is the manner in which a steam &quot;injector&quot; operates.

An additional use for the injector technology is in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw air out of the vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The exhaust from the ejectors is invariably directed to the smokebox, by which means it assists the blower in draughting the fire. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam and is only required to operate when the train is moving.

=== Air ejector ===
Commonly called an air ejector, Venturi pump, or vacuum ejector. This ejector is similar in operation to the steam ejector but uses high-pressure air as the working fluid. Multistage air ejectors can be used, but since air cannot easily be condensed at room temperature, an air ejector is usually limited to two stages as each subsequent stage would have to be significantly larger than the last. These are commonly used in pneumatic handling equipment when a small vacuum is required to pick up objects since compressed air is often already present to power other parts of the equipment. Air ejectors used to suction liquids directly will produce a fine mist of droplets, this is how airbrushes and many other spraying systems operate, but when a spray is not required it is typically an undesirable effect that limits the applications to gas suction.

<text>&quot;For the art, see stained glass fusing.&quot;

Fusing is a type of manufacturing process for joining or terminating electrical magnet wire, that is coated with a varnish (film) type insulation, to itself or some type of electrical terminal, without prior removal of the insulation. During the fusing process, the varnish film insulation is vaporized automatically. The entire process takes between a quarter of a second to 50 seconds, depending upon the geometry of the wires being joined.</text><links>

<text>Faber and Faber Limited, commonly known as Faber &amp; Faber or simply Faber, is an independent publishing house in London. Published authors and poets include T. S. Eliot (an early Faber editor and director), W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis, Margaret Storey, William Golding, Samuel Beckett, Philip Larkin, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Paul Muldoon, Milan Kundera and Kazuo Ishiguro.

Founded in 1929, in 2006 the company was named the KPMG Publisher of the Year.

Faber and Faber Inc., formerly the American branch of the London company, was sold in 1998 to the Holtzbrinck company Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG). Faber and Faber ended the partnership with FSG in 2015 and began distributing its books directly in the United States.

==History==
Faber and Faber began as a firm in 1929, but originated in the Scientific Press, owned by Sir Maurice and Lady Gwyer. The Scientific Press derived much of its income from the weekly magazine &quot;The Nursing Mirror&quot;. The Gwyers&#x27; desire to expand into trade publishing led them to Geoffrey Faber, a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford; they founded Faber and Gwyer in 1925. After four years, &quot;The Nursing Mirror&quot; was sold and Geoffrey Faber and the Gwyers agreed to go their separate ways. Faber selected the company name of Faber and Faber, although there was no other Faber involved.

T. S. Eliot, who had been suggested to Faber by Charles Whibley, had left Lloyds Bank in London to join Faber as a literary adviser; in the first season, the firm issued his &quot;Poems 1909–1925&quot;. In addition, the catalogues from the early years included books by Ezra Pound, Jean Cocteau, Herbert Read, Max Eastman, George Rylands, John Dover Wilson, Geoffrey Keynes, Forrest Reid, Charles Williams, and Vita Sackville-West. In 1928, Faber and Faber published its first commercial success, &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;. The book was at first published anonymously; the author&#x27;s name, Siegfried Sassoon, was added to the title page for the second impression. Over the next six months, it was reprinted eight times.

===Role in publishing===
Poetry was originally the most renowned part of the Faber list, with W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Louis MacNeice joining Ezra Pound, Marianne Moore, Wyndham Lewis, John Gould Fletcher, Roy Campbell, James Joyce, David Jones (artist-poet) and Walter de la Mare being published under T. S. Eliot&#x27;s aegis.

Under Geoffrey Faber&#x27;s chairmanship, the board in 1929 included Eliot, Richard de la Mare, Charles Stewart, and Frank Vigor Morley. The firm&#x27;s art director was Berthold Wolpe. Faber published biographies, memoirs, fiction, poetry, political and religious essays, art and architecture monographs, children&#x27;s books, and an ecology list. It also published Eliot&#x27;s literary review, &quot;The Criterion&quot;. Eliot rejected two books by George Orwell, &quot;A Scullion&#x27;s Diary&quot; (the original version of &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;) and &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

During the Second World War, paper shortages resulted in high profits, but much of this profit went to taxation.

Notable postwar Faber writers include William Golding (although the company almost rejected his &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;), Lawrence Durrell, Robert Lowell, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, W. S. Graham, Philip Larkin, P. D. James, Tom Stoppard, and John Osborne. The firm increased its investment in contemporary drama, including plays by three Nobel Laureates: Harold Pinter, Samuel Beckett, and T. S. Eliot. Other playwrights subsequently joined Faber, including Alan Ayckbourn, Alan Bennett, Brian Friel, Tony Harrison, David Hare, Frank McGuinness, and Timberlake Wertenbaker.

===Today===
Modern writers such as Kazuo Ishiguro, Peter Carey, Orhan Pamuk, and Barbara Kingsolver also joined Faber. In addition, Faber has published the translated work of prominent novelists and poets including Milan Kundera, Thomas Bernhard, Günter Grass, Nikos Kazantzakis, Wisława Szymborska, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Czesław Miłosz. Having published the theatrical works of Samuel Beckett for several years, the company acquired the rights to the remainder of his oeuvre from the publishing house of John Calder in 2007. Faber announced in October 2011 that Jarvis Cocker, lead singer of the band Pulp, would be joining as editor-at-large, an appointment similar to one held by Pete Townshend of The Who in the 1980s.

In 2008, the imprint Faber Finds was set up to make copyrighted out-of-print books reavailable, using print-on-demand technology. Works republished in the imprint have included items from the Mass-Observation archives, and works by John Betjeman, Angus Wilson, A. J. P. Taylor, H. G. Wells, Joyce Cary, Nina Bawden, Jean Genet, P. H. Newby, Louis MacNeice, John Carey, F. R. Leavis, Jacob Bronowski, Jan Morris, and Brian Aldiss. In 2009, Faber Finds began to release e-books.

Faber&#x27;s American arm was sold in 1998 to Farrar, Straus and Giroux (&quot;FSG&quot;), where it remained as an imprint focused on arts, entertainment, media, and popular culture. In February 2015, Faber announced the end of its partnership with FSG.

In June 2012, to coincide with the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, Faber launched a website – Sixty Years in Sixty Poems. Commissioned for The Space – the new digital arts platform developed by the Arts Council in partnership with the BBC – Sixty Years in Sixty Poems took the poems from Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy&#x27;s anthology, Jubilee Lines, and interpreted them using actors&#x27; recordings, sound-based generative design, and archive film footage.

==Faber Academy==
In 2008, Faber launched Faber Academy, a creative writing business offering courses for aspiring writers. Courses include &quot;Writing a Novel&quot;, &quot;Advanced Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Getting Started: Beginners&#x27; Fiction&quot;. At times, courses are tutored by famous writers, such as Mike Figgis, Jeanette Winterson, and Tobias Hill. Notable students have included S. J. Watson and Georgian/British singer-songwriter Katie Melua.

In 2018, The Faber Academy started offering a scholarship to two writers every year, with a focus on under-represented groups such as writers of colour, disabled writers and LGBTQ+ writers.

==Faber Digital==
Faber Digital was launched in 2009. It has published a number of book-related apps for the iPhone and the iPad, including Malcolm Tucker: The Missing Phone (which was nominated for a BAFTA award), QI: Quite Interesting, Harry Hill&#x27;s Joke Book, and The Waste Land for iPad app. The Waste Land for iPad app was Faber&#x27;s second collaboration with Touch Press, following the Solar System for iPad, which won the Futurebook Award for Digital innovation at the Book Industry Awards in 2011. In 2013, in partnership with Bloomsbury Publishing plc, Faber Digital launched Drama Online, a subscription-based digital content platform for libraries, educators, students, and researchers.

==Faber Factory==
Faber introduced Faber Factory in 2011, an eBook conversion and digitisation service. Faber Factory won the Services to Independent Publishers Award at the IPG Awards in 2013 and 2015.

==Location==
The firm&#x27;s original location was its Georgian offices at 24 Russell Square, in Bloomsbury, London. Faber later moved to 3 Queen Square, London, and on 19 January 2009 the firm moved to Bloomsbury House, 74–77 Great Russell Street, London. The company relocated to The Bindery, Hatton Garden, London in 2023.

<doc id="692122" wikidata="Q574784" url="?curid=692122" title="Lauda (song)">
<text>The lauda (Italian pl. laude) or lauda spirituale was the most important form of vernacular sacred song in Italy in the late medieval era and Renaissance. &quot;Laude&quot; remained popular into the nineteenth century. The lauda was often associated with Christmas, and so is in part equivalent to the English carol, French noel, Spanish villancico, and like these genres occupies a middle ground between folk and learned lyrics.

==Origin and spread of the lauda==
Originally, the &quot;lauda&quot; was a monophonic (single-voice) form, but a polyphonic type developed in the early fifteenth century. The early &quot;lauda&quot; was probably influenced by the music of the troubadours, since it shows similarities in rhythm, melodic style, and especially notation. Many troubadours had fled their original homelands, such as Provence, during the Albigensian Crusade in the early 13th century, and settled in northern Italy where their music was influential in the development of the Italian secular style.

A monophonic form of the &quot;lauda&quot; spread widely throughout Europe during the 13th and 14th centuries as the music of the flagellants; this form was known as the &quot;Geisslerlied&quot;, and picked up the vernacular language in each country it affected, including Germany, Poland, England and Scandinavia.

After 1480 the singing of &quot;laude&quot; was extremely popular in Florence, since the monk Savonarola (and others) had prohibited the dissemination of any other style of sacred vernacular music. Many of Josquin&#x27;s motets and masses are based on melodies he heard in &quot;laude&quot; during his sojourns in Italy around this time.

&quot;Laude&quot; had a resurgence of popularity again at the time of the Counter-Reformation, since one of the musical goals of the Council of Trent was to increase the intelligibility of text, and the simple, easily understood laude provided an ideal example.

The &quot;lauda&quot; declined in importance with the development of the oratorio. However, tunes and lyrics continued to influence later music.

==Latin songs with some characteristics of the lauda==
Song Latin songs, notably 13 Latin antiphons preserved in the Bobbio Abbey, have sometimes been called &quot;Latin laude,&quot; however which more closely resemble Latin language version of the Italian ballata.

==Selected recordings==

<text>Diane Kruger (; Heidkrüger; ; born 15 July 1976) is a German actress. Early in her career, she gained worldwide recognition and received the Trophée Chopard from the Cannes Film Festival. 

Kruger became known for her roles in film as Helen in the epic war film &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), Dr. Abigail Chase in the heist film &quot;National Treasure&quot; (2004) and its 2007 sequel, Bridget von Hammersmark in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s war film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (2009), and Gina in the psychological thriller film &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011). She also starred as Detective Sonya Cross in the FX crime drama series &quot;The Bridge&quot; (2013–14). In 2017, she made her German-language debut in Fatih Akin&#x27;s &quot;In the Fade&quot;, for which she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress. In 2019, Kruger starred in the spy-thriller &quot;The Operative&quot; with Martin Freeman.

==Early life==
Diane Heidkrüger was born on 15 July 1976. She grew up in a deeply Catholic German family, and attended Catholic school. She has stated that one of her grandmothers was Polish.

She was brought up in West Germany with her younger brother, Stefan. Her mother sent her to student exchange programs when she was a teenager to improve her English. As a child, Kruger wanted to become a ballerina and successfully auditioned for the Royal Ballet School in London, but a knee injury cut short her ballet career. Later, Kruger moved to Paris, attending drama school and working as a model and began learning and speaking fluent French.

==Career==
=== Modeling ===
In 1993, Kruger represented Germany in the Elite Model Look and started modeling afterwards. Despite her relatively short stature for a model, she managed to land bookings such as advertisements from Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Salvatore Ferragamo, Giorgio Armani, Jil Sander, Christian Dior, Burberry and Louis Vuitton; runway shows from Marc Jacobs, D&amp;G and Sonia Rykiel; and appearances on the cover of &quot;Vogue Paris&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; to her modeling repertoire. She gradually stopped modelling after deciding to pursue a career in acting.

=== Acting ===
Kruger became interested in acting and took lessons at the Cours Florent. She made her film debut in 2002, opposite Dennis Hopper and Christopher Lambert in &quot;The Piano Player&quot;, a TV film by Jean-Pierre Roux. The same year, she also starred in her then husband&#x27;s directorial début &quot;Mon Idole&quot;.

She played Julie Wood in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; and Lisa in &quot;Wicker Park&quot; (2004), alongside Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne. One of her more high-profile roles to date is her portrayal of Helen of Sparta in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s epic &quot;Troy&quot;. In 2004, Kruger starred with Nicolas Cage and Sean Bean (who co-starred with her in &quot;Troy&quot;) in the film &quot;National Treasure&quot;, going on to appear in films &quot;Joyeux Noël&quot; (2005) and &quot;Copying Beethoven&quot; (2006). She reprised her role as Dr. Abigail Chase in &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;, released in December 2007.

Kruger was the hostess of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Kruger was a jury member of the 58th Berlin International Film Festival in 2008. The festival is chaired by Costa Gavras.

In 2009, she co-starred as a German actress turned Allied spy in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. In December 2009, she announced the nominations of the 67th Golden Globe Awards and also picked up nominations from the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild for Best Supporting Actress and Outstanding Performance by a Cast of a Motion Picture for her role in &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;.

Kruger played Anna in Jaco Van Dormael&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Nobody&quot;. Critical response has praised the film&#x27;s artistry and Kruger&#x27;s acting. Kruger made a cameo appearance in an April 2010 episode of the Fox show &quot;Fringe&quot;, in which her former boyfriend, actor Joshua Jackson, starred. In 2010, Kruger also appeared in Mark Ronson&#x27;s music video for &quot;Somebody to Love Me&quot;, where she plays Boy George.

In the 2011 film &quot;Unknown&quot;, Kruger starred as Gina, a Bosnian undocumented immigrant, and key character alongside leading actor Liam Neeson. It was also announced in 2011 that Kruger had replaced Eva Green in the role of Marie Antoinette in the French-language film, &quot;Les Adieux à la Reine&quot;. In 2012, she was named as a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. The festival is chaired by Nanni Moretti. She starred in the film adaptation of Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s novel &quot;The Host,&quot; which was released in March 2013. Kruger also portrayed El Paso, Texas, police officer Sonya Cross on FX&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge&quot;, which aired in 2013. In 2015, she was named as a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the 2015 Venice Film Festival. In 2016, she co-starred in &quot;The Infiltrator&quot; with Bryan Cranston and John Leguizamo. 
In 2017, Kruger made a rare film appearance in Germany in the thriller &quot;In the Fade&quot; by Fatih Akin, for which she won several awards. In 2019, Kruger replaced Marion Cotillard in the spy movie &quot;The 355&quot;, playing a BND agent.

In 2022, Kruger starred in the thriller &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, opposite Ray Nicholson, son of Jack. The following year, she joined the cast of David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Shrouds&quot;, replacing Léa Seydoux. She will portray three different characters in the film.

==Public image==
Kruger was included in &quot;People&quot; &quot;50 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot; 2004 issue. She appeared on &quot;Maxim&quot; &quot;Hot 100&quot; list twice, ranking at No. 50 in 2005 and No. 88 in 2009. She also ranked at No. 83 on AskMen &quot;Top 99 Women&quot; list in 2010.

Kruger is a brand ambassador for Swiss watch manufacturer Jaeger-LeCoultre. In December 2009, she was announced as the global &quot;spokesmodel&quot; of L&#x27;Oréal. It was announced in May 2010 that she would become the latest face for Calvin Klein&#x27;s newest fragrance line, Beauty.

==Personal life==
Kruger is fluent in German, English and French. Additionally, she studied Latin in school for eight years, though she does not speak it. Kruger has stated that she has a fear of horses and will not take part in any films that require her to ride or interact with horses, revealing that she has given up roles in the past because of this. Her fear stems from having been previously thrown off the animals by accident.

In 1999, she began dating French actor and director Guillaume Canet. They were married on 1 September 2001. They acted together in &quot;Joyeux Noël&quot; (2005) and divorced in 2006. Kruger said that the marriage was unsuccessful because their careers had kept them in different parts of the world. 

From 2006 to 2016, she was in a relationship with actor Joshua Jackson.

In 2015, Kruger met actor Norman Reedus on the set of &quot;Sky&quot;. The two were first seen together as a couple in July 2016. In November 2018, Kruger gave birth to their daughter, her first and his second child.

<text>Rathaus Spandau (Spandau Town Hall) is the western terminus of Berlin U-Bahn line U7 (the Eastern one being Rudow). It was opened on 1 October 1984 with the line&#x27;s extension from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau. The station takes its name from the nearby Rathaus Spandau, the historic city hall of Spandau.

Close to the U-Bahn station Rathaus Spandau is the Berlin-Spandau station of the Berlin S-Bahn line S5 and the Deutsche Bahn for regional and intercity transport. The next station on the U7 line is Altstadt Spandau.

The station was built in a box under a cover in order to minimise the disturbance of surface traffic. With its two island platforms, the station, which was designed by Rainer G. Rümmler, has almost monumental dimensions. It has a big hall with high ceilings, much light and 64 lamps, columns with black granite and a parquet floor like floor. The southern end of its platforms are spanned by a gallery for the movement of passengers to the surface and from which the entire station can be seen. The U-Bahn station also includes a signal control centre for the line to Paulsternstraße.

U-Bahn line U7 uses the inner tracks, which are built for large profile trains, while the track beds of the outer tracks, which are built for the operation of small profile trains on a planned extension of the U-Bahn line U2, which currently runs only as far as Ruhleben, are currently empty. Uniquely for the Berlin U-Bahn, this line would run to the left of the platforms to improve interchanges for the planned extensions of the U7 to Staaken and the U2 to Falkenhagener Feld. An extension of the U7 south to Heerstraße is currently being planned, with a projected completion date in the mid-2030s. In 2021, the 4.26km, 5-station extension was projected to cost €578 million.

Although the station is very close to Spandau S-Bahn station, it has kept its name. Nevertheless, Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe buses always show the destination as &quot;S+U Rathaus Spandau&quot;, but the S-Bahn station is only signed as &quot;Spandau&quot;.

<text>Altstadt Spandau is a station in the Spandau district of Berlin, on that city&#x27;s U-Bahn line . It takes its name from the Altstadt Spandau, the historic central area of the former independent city of Spandau.

The station was opened on 1 October 1984 (architect R.G.Rümmler) with the line&#x27;s extension from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau. It lies between Rathaus Spandau and Zitadelle stations.
The next station is Zitadelle.

The station was, like many U-Bahn stations at that time, very elaborately and magnificently designed by Rainer G. Rümmler. In March 2017, it was announced that the station - along with six other northern U7 stations - would be heritage listed. This happened at the end of 2018.

It lies at a depth of , as to the east the nearby river Havel had to be crossed. Therefore the caisson method was used to construct the station. In the direction of Spandau Town Hall, the then unusual shield tunneling method was used to preserve the historical buildings in Spandau&#x27;s Altstadt (Old Town).

A barrier-free extension of the station, including a lift, is planned for the end of 2019.

<text>The prime minister of Slovakia, officially the chairman of the government of the Slovak Republic (Slovak: &quot;Predseda vlády Slovenskej republiky&quot;), commonly referred to in Slovakia as Predseda vlády or informally as Premiér, is the head of the government of the Slovak Republic. Officially, the officeholder is the third-highest constitutional official in Slovakia after the president of the Republic (appointer) and chairman of the National Council; in practice, the appointee is the country&#x27;s leading political figure.

Since the office was created in 1969, fifteen different people have served as head of government. Since 1993, when Slovakia gained independence, nine people have occupied the function. On 25 October 2023, Robert Fico became the prime minister of Slovakia.

==History==
The office of the prime minister of Slovakia was established in 1969 by the Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation. A similar office had existed from 1918 when various officials were presiding over executive bodies governing the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia or the Slovak State respectively. Since 1993, when the independent Slovak Republic was established, nine persons have held the office. Since 25 October 2023, the prime minister of Slovakia has been Robert Fico.

==Powers and role==
Since Slovakia is a parliamentary republic, the prime minister is accountable to the National Council. The Slovak Constitution provides that upon the accession to the office, each prime minister must gain and thereafter maintain the confidence of the Parliament. When the prime minister loses confidence, the president must dismiss him and designate a new prime minister or entrust the dismissed prime minister to act as a caretaker with limited powers.

The prime minister is the most powerful state office since he commands and presides over the government. Although it is not the prime minister but the president who appoints ministers in Cabinet, the president appoints ministers on the prime minister&#x27;s advice.

==Designated Prime Minister of Slovakia==
Designated Prime Minister of Slovakia () is an unofficial title for a person who has been entrusted by the president of the Slovak Republic with forming a new government and replacing the outgoing prime minister. This title, as well as the authorization of the president to entrust the designated prime minister, is not set by an act but is a legal or, more precisely, constitutional tradition. According to this tradition, the president designates a person who has the support of the majority of deputies in the National Council.

<doc id="692139" wikidata="Q1674430" url="?curid=692139" title="Interval cycle">
<text>In music, an interval cycle is a collection of pitch classes created from a sequence of the same interval class. In other words, a collection of pitches by starting with a certain note and going up by a certain interval until the original note is reached (e.g. starting from C, going up by 3 semitones repeatedly until eventually C is again reached - the cycle is the collection of all the notes met on the way). In other words, interval cycles &quot;unfold a single recurrent interval in a series that closes with a return to the initial pitch class&quot;. See: .

Interval cycles are notated by George Perle using the letter &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;cycle&quot;), with an interval class integer to distinguish the interval. Thus the diminished seventh chord would be C3 and the augmented triad would be C4. A superscript may be added to distinguish between transpositions, using 0–11 to indicate the lowest pitch class in the cycle. &quot;These interval cycles play a fundamental role in the harmonic organization of post-diatonic music and can easily be identified by naming the cycle.&quot;

Here are interval cycles C1, C2, C3, C4 and C6:

Interval cycles assume the use of equal temperament and may not work in other systems such as just intonation. For example, if the C4 interval cycle used justly-tuned major thirds it would fall flat of an octave return by an interval known as the diesis. Put another way, a major third above G is B, which is only enharmonically the same as C in systems such as equal temperament, in which the diesis has been tempered out.

Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven-pitch segment of C7 will produce the diatonic major scale:

This is known also known as a generated collection.
A minimum of three pitches are needed to represent an interval cycle.

Cyclic tonal progressions in the works of Romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Wagner form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Béla Bartók, Alexander Scriabin, Edgard Varèse, and the Second Viennese School (Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern). At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.

Interval cycles are also important in jazz, such as in Coltrane changes.

&quot;Similarly,&quot; to any pair of transpositionally related sets being reducible to two transpositionally related representations of the chromatic scale, &quot;the pitch-class relations between any pair of inversionally related sets is reducible to the pitch-class relations between two inversionally related representations of the semitonal scale.&quot; Thus an interval cycle or pair of cycles may be reducible to a representation of the chromatic scale.

As such, interval cycles may be differentiated as ascending or descending, with, &quot;the ascending form of the semitonal scale [called] a &#x27;P cycle&#x27; and the descending form [called] an &#x27;I cycle&#x27;,&quot; while, &quot;inversionally related dyads [are called] &#x27;P/I&#x27; dyads.&quot; P/I dyads will always share a sum of complementation. Cyclic sets are those &quot;sets whose alternate elements unfold complementary cycles of a single interval,&quot; that is an ascending and descending cycle:
In 1920 Berg discovered/created a &quot;master array&quot; of all twelve interval cycles:

<text>Zitadelle is a station on the Berlin U-Bahn line U7. It was opened on 1 October 1984 with the line&#x27;s extension from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau. Its name means &quot;Citadel&quot; in English and it was named for the historic Spandau Citadel. Unlike most U-Bahn stations, Zitadelle has side platforms.
The station&#x27;s interiors were also designed to resemble the citadel&#x27;s style.
It lies between the stations Altstadt Spandau and Haselhorst.
It was built/opened by R.G.Rümmler in 1984 (planned was the name &quot;Am Juliusturm&quot;). This station has side platforms because during its construction the important street above could not be blocked. So first the northern platform was built then the southern.
The next station is Haselhorst.

<text>Anovulation is when the ovaries do not release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle. Therefore, ovulation does not take place. However, a woman who does not ovulate at each menstrual cycle is not necessarily going through menopause. Chronic anovulation is a common cause of infertility.

In addition to the alteration of menstrual periods and infertility, chronic anovulation can cause or exacerbate other long-term problems, such as hyperandrogenism or osteopenia. It plays a central role in the multiple imbalances and dysfunctions of polycystic ovary syndrome.

During the first two years after menarche 50% of the menstrual cycles could be anovulatory cycles.

It is in fact possible to restore ovulation using appropriate medication, and ovulation is successfully restored in approximately 90% of cases. The first step is the diagnosis of anovulation. The identification of anovulation is not easy; contrary to what is commonly believed, women undergoing anovulation still have (more or less) regular periods. In general, women only notice that there is a problem once they have started trying to conceive.

Temperature charting is a useful way of providing early clues about anovulation, and can help gynaecologists in their diagnosis.

==Signs and symptoms==

Anovulation is usually associated with specific symptoms. However, it is important to note that they are not necessarily all displayed simultaneously. Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Infrequent and light menstruation occurs in about 40% of women with ovulatory dysfunction. Another potential symptom is irregular menstruation, where five or more menstrual cycles a year are five or more days shorter or longer than the length of the average cycle. Absence of mastodynia (breast pain or tenderness) occurs in about 20% of women with ovulatory problems. Also possible is increased body mass and facial hair, which is relatively easy to treat, and is often associated with PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome.

===Associated conditions===
For most women, alteration of menstrual periods is the principal indication of chronic anovulation. Ovulatory menstrual periods tend to be regular and predictable in terms of cycle length, duration and heaviness of bleeding, and other symptoms. Ovulatory periods are often accompanied by midcycle symptoms such as mittelschmerz or premenstrual symptoms. In contrast, anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding). Mittelschmerz and premenstrual symptoms tend to be absent or reduced when a woman is anovulatory.

==Causes==

Hormonal imbalance is the most common cause of anovulation and is thought to account for about 70% of all cases. About half the women with hormonal imbalances do not produce enough follicles to ensure the development of an ovule, possibly due to poor hormonal secretions from the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland controls most other hormonal glands in the human body. Therefore, any pituitary malfunctioning affects other glands under its influence, including the ovaries. This occurs in around 10% of cases. The pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus. In 10% of cases, alterations in the chemical signals from the hypothalamus can easily seriously affect the ovaries. There are other hormonal anomalies with no direct link to the ones mentioned above that can affect ovulation. For instance, women with hyper- or hypothyroidism sometimes have ovulation problems. Thyroid dysfunction can halt ovulation by upsetting the balance of the body&#x27;s natural reproductive hormones.

Currently, the four main causes of ovulatory disorders are polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HA), primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), and hyperprolactinemia.

=== Polycystic ovarian syndrome ===
Women with PCOS make up the greatest portion of anovulatory women in clinical practice. The criteria for a PCOS diagnosis is referred to as the Rotterdam criteria and consists of

# oligoovulation and/or anovulation
# excess androgen activity
# polycystic ovaries (by gynecologic ultrasound)

=== Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ===
Hypothalamic causes of HA include functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency. Laboratory findings of low serum estradiol and low FSH are associated with the decrease in hypothalamic secretion of GnRH.

A rare form of HA that presents as primary amenorrhea can be due to a congenital deficiency of GnRH knows as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or, Kallmann syndrome if it is associated with anosmia. Infiltrative disease or tumors affecting the hypothalamus and pituitary can result in HA.

FHA accounts for around 10–15% of all cases of anovulation. Weight loss or anorexia can lead to FHA by causing a hormonal imbalance, leading to irregular ovulation (dysovulation). It is possible that this mechanism evolved to protect the mother&#x27;s health. A pregnancy where the mother is weak could pose a risk to the baby&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s health. On the other hand, excess weight can also create ovarian dysfunctions. Dr Barbieri of Harvard Medical School has indicated that cases of anovulation are quite frequent in women with a BMI (body mass index) over 27 kg/m2.

=== Primary ovarian insufficiency ===
POI was previously referred to as premature ovarian failure (POF) and diagnosed when menopause occurred before age 40 but occurs in only 1 percent of all women. The ovaries can stop working in about 5% of cases. This may be because the ovaries do not contain eggs. However, a complete blockage of the ovaries is rarely a cause of infertility. Blocked ovaries can start functioning again without a clear medical explanation. In some cases, the egg may have matured properly, but the follicle may have failed to burst (or the follicle may have burst without releasing the egg). This is called luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS). Physical damage to the ovaries, or ovaries with multiple cysts, may affect their ability to function. This is called ovarian dystrophy.

=== Hyperprolactinemia ===
Hyperprolactinemia anovulation makes up 5 to 10 percent of women with anovulation. Hyperprolactinemia inhibits gonadotropin secretion by inhibiting GnRH. Hyperprolactinemia can be confirmed by several measurements of serum prolactin.

==Diagnosis==

===Fertility awareness and LH measurement===

Symptoms-based methods of fertility awareness may be used to detect ovulation or to determine that cycles are anovulatory. Charting of the menstrual cycle may be done by hand, or with the aid of various fertility monitors. Records of one of the primary fertility awareness signs—basal body temperature—can detect ovulation by identifying the shift in temperature which takes place after ovulation. It is said to be the most reliable way of confirming whether ovulation has occurred.

Women may also use ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) which detect the increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels that usually indicates imminent ovulation. For some women, these devices do not detect the LH surge, or high levels of LH are a poor predictor of ovulation; this is particularly common in women with PCOS. In such cases, OPKs and those fertility monitors which are based on LH may show false results, with an increased number of false positives or false negatives. Dr. Freundl from the University of Heidelberg suggests that tests which use LH as a reference often lack sensitivity and specificity.

===Classification and testing===
The World Health Organization criteria for classification of anovulation include the determination of oligomenorrhea (menstrual cycle &gt;35 days) or amenorrea (menstrual cycle &gt;6 months) in combination with concentration of prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2). The patients are classified as WHO1 (15%)—hypo-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic, WHO2 (80%)—normo-gonadotropic, normo-estrogenic, and WHO3 (5%)—hyper-gonadotropic, hypo-estrogenic. The vast majority of anovulation patients belong to the WHO2 group and demonstrate very heterogeneous symptoms ranging from anovulation, obesity, biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. This classification system does not include a separate category for anovulation caused by hyperprolactinemia, and experts do not consistently use this system.

Diagnosis of anovulation cause involves hormone level tests, in conjunction with an assessment of associated symptoms. A patient history and physical exam should include history of onset and pattern of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, signs of PCOS such as hyperandrogenism and obesity, eating disorders, causes of excessive physical or mental stress, and breast secretions. Patients with symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism, can be tested for serum androgen levels as well as serum total testosterone levels. A 17-hydroprogesterone test may also be conducted if congenital adrenal hyperplasia is suspected. If the differential is broad, hormone serum levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin can be diagnostic since most causes of anovulation are hormonal imbalances. Transvaginal ultrasound may also be used to visualize polycystic ovaries.

==Treatments==
Treatment should be based on diagnosis of anovulation. Treatment varies based on the 4 most common causes of anovulation: polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HA), primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), and hyperprolactinemia.  Importantly, semen analysis should be carried out of the XY partner to exclude severe XY factors before managing anovulatory subfertility. Overall, in healthy individuals with anovulation, ovulatory disorders may be favorably influenced by a healthy diet such as a higher consumption of monounsaturated fats rather than trans fats, vegetable rather than animal protein sources, high fat dairy, multivitamins, and iron from plants and supplements.

===Treatment for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)===

Treatment for management of anovulation due to PCOS is multifaceted, including weight reduction, ovulation induction agents, insulin-sensitizing agents, gonadotrophins and ovarian drilling. In PCOS patients with overweight or obesity, weight loss is first line treatment. Studies show a reduction in weight as little of 5% by caloric restriction and increased physical activity can re-establish spontaneously ovulation and improve response to ovulation induction therapy if initiated. Weight loss also generally results in improved menstrual regularity and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS.

It is well recognized that insulin resistance can be part of the sequelae of PCOS and if present, contribute to anovulation. Metformin, a biguanide, is a common insulin sensitizer often given to treat women with PCOS. No other insulin sensitizers have evidence of effective and safe use of fertility treatment. Previously, metformin was recommended as treatment for anovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome, but in the largest trial to date, comparing clomiphene with metformin, clomiphene was more effective than metformin alone. Following this study, the ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored A consensus workshop does not recommend metformin for ovulation stimulation. Subsequent randomized studies have confirmed the lack of evidence for adding metformin to clomiphene.

==== Ovulation induction ====

The main ovulation induction medications include:
*Antiestrogen, causing an inhibition of the negative feedback of estrogen on the pituitary gland, resulting in an increase in secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone. Medications in use for this effect are mainly clomifene citrate and tamoxifen (both being selective estrogen-receptor modulators), as well as letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor).
*Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), directly stimulating the ovaries. In women with anovulation, it may be an alternative after 7–12 attempted cycles of pituitary feedback regimens (as evidenced by clomifene citrate), since the latter ones are less expensive and more easy to control.

=== Treatment for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HA) ===
In women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism suspicious for functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, treatment should be centered around weight gain, reducing intensity and frequency of exercise, and stress reduction with psychotherapy or counseling. Athletes and women with anorexia can have reduced GnRH pulsing due to hypothalamic dysfunction due to increased energy requirements without their needs being met calorically and severely reduced caloric intake, respectively. If anovulation persists following lifestyle modifications, ovulation can be induced with pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or gonadotrophin (FSH &amp; LH) administration.

=== Treatment for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) ===
For women with POI that desire pregnancy, ovulation induction strategies should be avoided and assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes, should be offered.

=== Treatment for hyperprolactinemia ===
For anovulatory women with hyperprolactinemia without symptoms, they can forgo treatment and continue with close follow up and medical observation. If symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are present, dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, are first line treatment which act by inhibiting production of prolactin by the pituitary and can shrink a prolactin-secretin lesion (i.e. prolactinoma) if present. In rare cases, endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal surgery and radiotherapy, may be required to resect and shrink a prolactinoma if greater than 10 mm in size. Importantly, individuals should be able to conceive following normalization of serum prolactin levels and shrinking or removal of the tumor.

===Other treatments===
Corticosteroids (usually found in anti-inflammatory drugs) can be used to treat anovulation if it is caused by an overproduction of male hormones by the adrenal glands. Corticosteroids are usually used to reduce the production of testosterone.

<text>Rohrdamm is a station on the Berlin U-Bahn line U7 in the Siemensstadt district.

Designed by architect Rümmler, the station was opened on 1 October 1980, as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Richard-Wagner-Platz to Rohrdamm. Until the second extension of the line from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau in 1984, it was the western terminus of the U7. The name literally means &quot;pipe dam&quot;; as the eponymous street was laid out along a water pipe which gets its water from the Tegeler See and fills the water works in Jungfernheide, from which about 250,000 people get drinking water. The station&#x27;s machine-like decoration, featuring cog-wheels and pipes, points to this. The adjacent stations are Paulsternstraße and Siemensdamm.

<text>Major League Volleyball (MLV) was a women&#x27;s professional volleyball league in the United States. It was established in 1987 and disbanded during its third season on March 20, 1989.

The league was launched in 1987 with six teams consisting of nine players per team, most of them former Olympians or college All-Americans. According to the league&#x27;s first commissioner, Steve Arnold, each MLV player received a base salary of $5,500 per season. Bonuses were awarded to teams for each victory and for a top-three finish, while the team that won the league championship received $25,000. Bonuses were also awarded to players for excelling in one of six statistical categories. For example, the player who was best in serving aces got an extra $3,000. The egalitarian pay scale made contract negotiations unnecessary.

There were no independent team owners during the first two years of the league&#x27;s existence. Instead, there were essentially six major shareholders. &quot;It was a concept I developed through having operated pro sports leagues and teams,&quot; said Arnold, an attorney who had been a sports agent and was involved with the World Football League, American Basketball Association, World Hockey Association and World TeamTennis. Before the league&#x27;s third and final season began in 1989, Major League Volleyball granted licensing agreements to ownership groups for each of the league&#x27;s six teams. The initial licensing fee paid by each ownership group was $100,000. During the MLV&#x27;s two years in operation they gave out awards for Most Valuable Player (MVP). In the leagues first season in 1987 it was given to Rita Crockett. And in 1988 it was awarded to Ruth Lawson of the Minnesota Monarchs.

The MLV draft was open to any American players who did not have collegiate eligibility and did not play for a professional league in another country or on the U.S. national volleyball team. Through a trust agreement with the USVBL, the players retained their Olympic eligibility.

MLV got a contract with ESPN to televise 10 regular season contests on a tape delay basis, and a playoff game and live coverage of the league&#x27;s championship match. It had a solid start in attendance with crowds between 350 and 3,000 in the opening weeks of competition in 1987. The three-day championship tournament held at Williams Arena in 1988 had a total attendance of 7,072, including 3,404 (a league record) for the semifinal match between the San Jose Golddiggers and Minnesota Monarchs on Friday, May 20.

The league had only two sets of warmups circulating among its teams until two weeks into the first season. And the game uniforms, ordered from Japan, were in quarantine until two days before the season opened.

The content, records, and player information were obtained from a collection of VCR recordings of the original ESPN broadcasts. Commentary on players is credited to MLV sports analyst and host Chris Marlowe.

<text>Jakob-Kaiser-Platz is a metro station on the Berlin U-Bahn line U7, located in the Charlottenburg-Nord district. It was opened on 1 October 1980 (architect R.G.Rümmler) with the line&#x27;s extension from Richard-Wagner-Platz to Rohrdamm. The eponymous traffic circle located above the station is named after politician and Resistance fighter Jakob Kaiser (1888–1961). The next station going eastbound is Jungfernheide (change there for DB and S-Bahn)

==History==
Originally planned under the name Charlottenburg-Nord, the station was built in 1967 future proofing for line U7 in the construction of the above autobahn A 111 and was used to the inclusion of the underground operation as a pedestrian tunnel to the crossing of the highway. However, the actual construction of the underground line between Richard-Wagner-Platz and Rohrdamm did not begin until 1973. Together with the other stations of this construction section, the subway station, opened under the name Jakob-Kaiser-Platz , was put into operation on 1 October 1980.

Like the other stations of the U7 line that were also built at the same time, this station was also designed by Rainer G. Rümmler . Rümmler designed a 110-meter-long central platform with two entrances to the west and east of the A 100 city motorway . The station itself is relatively simple and resembles the neighboring underground station Halemweg . The walls behind the tracks and the support columns are in yellow. The station nameplates are colored dark blue / red. The floor is brightly tiled today . The entrances to the Kurt Schumacher-damm are also yellow roofed in the striking style of the 1970s.

For 2013, a refurbishment of the station was planned. The station was rebuilt to be more accessible and two elevators were installed. The completion of the work was then scheduled for 2017, the cost of which was estimated at 2.1 million euros. Meanwhile, the wall panels have been replaced on the rear track areas by yellow tiles and station signs located there replaced by a smaller and simpler version. The ceiling lights, which were previously arranged transversely to the edge of the platform, gave way to a longitudinal strip of light. The first lift finally went into operation in December 2018, it leads from the east side of the Kurt Schumacher Damm on the platform and cost about 1.1 million euros. A second elevator on the western side will be completed in 2021. For barrier-free expansion, a total of 3.9 million euros are now estimated.

A bus run to now closed Berlin Tegel &quot;Otto Lilienthal&quot; Airport.

<doc id="692163" wikidata="Q990637" url="?curid=692163" title="Broomball">
<text>Broomball is a both a recreational and organized competitive winter and ball sport played on ice or snow. It is played either indoors or outdoors, depending on the climate and location. It is most popularly played in Canada and the United States.

Unlike most winter team sports played on ice, organized broomball does not use ice skates. Player footwear for formal play consists of shoes created specifically for broomball which are designed to improve a player&#x27;s traction on the ice. Though the sport can be played outdoors on snow, organized broomball in the 21st century is primarily played on an ice hockey rink.

Players hit a ball around the ice or snow with a stick. Regardless of whether the broomball stick used by players is a literal broom or a conventional broomball stick with a molded paddle-shaped end, the stick is simply called a &quot;broom.&quot; The broom may have a wooden or aluminum shaft and has a rubber-molded triangular head similar in shape to that of a regular broom (or, originally, an actual corn broom with the bristles either cut off or covered with tape or another restricting material). Players wear special rubber-soled shoes instead of skates, and the ice is prepared in such a way that it is smooth and dry to improve traction. The ball used differs based on location: The indoor ball is smooth while the outdoor ball has ridges and resembles a small soccer ball.

In a game of broomball there are two teams, each consisting of six players: a goaltender and five others. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opponent. Goals are scored by hitting the ball into the opponent&#x27;s net using a traditional broom or the more conventional paddle-shaped stick designed for the sport. Tactics and plays are similar to those used in sports such as ice hockey, roller hockey and floorball. The sport uses its own offside rules in both International Federation of Broomball Associations (IFBA) rules and American broomball rules, but both differ. While ice hockey goal nets are sometimes used, a regulation-sized broomball net is considerably larger by comparison. IFBA sanctioned games use a net, while American broomball uses nets.

The sport involves organized competitions and events run by its international governing body, the IFBA. The national organization in Canada is Broomball Canada while in the United States the two main organizations are All Elite Broomball (AEB) and the United States Broomball Association (USBA). Every two years the IFBA holds the IFBA World Broomball Championships (also known as the Challenge Cup), an international event with teams from around the world. Historically, the championships have been dominated by the North American teams.

A similar game called Moscow broomball is played in Russia.

== Gameplay ==

The sport is played on either an indoor or outdoor ice rink. Conventional play involves the use equipment designed specifically for broomball, though recreationally the traditional corn broom with tape is still used. A regulation broomball goal net is considerably larger than the one used in the sport of ice hockey, though conventional ice hockey nets are often used unofficially.

A broomball game begins with a face-off. A typical game of broomball is broken up into two or three periods. Each team has a goaltender plus five other players, typically two defenders and three attackers (two forwards and one centre). If the ice surface is especially small, some leagues use fewer players on the ice.

The object of the game is to score goals into the opponent&#x27;s goal or net. The team with the most goals at the end of a game is declared the winner. In some tournaments, if the scores are tied after regular time, an additional overtime period is played to determine a winner. In the overtime period (in most cases), six players, three on each team, play five minutes without a goalie. The team to score more goals in the overtime period is declared the winner. In the event of another tie, a second overtime period may be played. In some games a shootout period will be played. The shooter has the choice to have the ball placed a specified distance from the net or, like in hockey, can play the ball from centre ice.

== Equipment ==
Sport specific equipment involves broomball shoes, broomball sticks, and broomball balls. Equipment used is either traditional for an informal style of play, or a deliberately manufactured design created for modern, formal play.

===Protective equipment===
In competitive play, protective equipment for broomball is similar to that used in the sports of ice hockey and ringette with some sport specific equipment designed for broomball.

===Broomball stick===

In traditional play, a broom is literally a broom, usually a corn broom, with tape added to keep the bristles from fraying. In the modern game, a broomball stick has a shaft with a stylized hard plastic paddle at the end.

===Broomball shoes===
Shoes designed specifically for broomball are available for purchase, but only for games played on ice. The soles are designed to give players traction on the ice.

===Broomball balls===

In informal play, players can use any type of ball, though a soccer ball is usually used. In more formal play, two types of balls are manufactured for use. An outdoor ball is usually the color blue, while the indoor ball is the color orange.

===Broomball goal nets===

Broomball goal nets have a different shape than those used in ice hockey and ringette and are larger.

=== Goaltender equipment ===
Goaltenders generally wear a full face cage in addition to thick padding on the legs, thighs, chest and shoulders. Goaltenders are permitted to use a &quot;blocker&quot;, a specially designed rectangular glove attachment that is used to block shots. A blocker is similar to those used by ice hockey and ringette goalies. Goalie&#x27;s must also wear a chest protector.

== Officials ==
Broomball games are controlled by two on-ice referees. Both referees have the same powers to call all penalties, off-sides, goals, and so on. There usually are off-ice officials as well, depending on the level of the game being played, including a scorekeeper, a timekeeper, a penalty timekeeper, and goal judges.

Referees are generally required to wear black and white vertical-striped jerseys, with a red arm band on one arm. They use this arm to signal penalties throughout the game.

== History ==

There is no known fully accurate history of broomball. The exact origin of the sport has been difficult to pinpoint. The best estimates in regards to its origin involves the First Nations in Canada, who are believed to have passed the sport on to the settlers.

The first known recorded broomball games in North America have been found documented in Perdue, Saskatchewan, on March 5, 1909, though the game has also been observed to have been played by organized girls teams in the Canadian province of Ontario in the early 1900s.

The Canadian style of the game is believed to have spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota. In 1910 a group of men would gather and play on the ice by the docks in Duluth, Minnesota. By the 1960s a broomball community was thriving in Minnesota.

Initially the sport used brooms, usually corn brooms, and an assortment of different types of balls which were bigger than a baseball but not larger than a soccer ball. The playing area for a game of broomball took place on either a snow-covered area or field, or on an area of ice created by frozen ponds, lakes, rivers and the like, until both enclosed indoor and outdoor ice rinks, usually ice hockey rinks using artificial ice became more prevalent. Today the game is played on snow mostly during organized winter festivals, but play using an ice surface, especially artificial ones, has grown in popularity and is the playing area more prevalently seen used today. In regards to equipment, sport specific sticks and balls are available and have been developed for the game with balls designed for both indoor and outdoor play, while protective equipment is similar to and sometimes identical to that found in the sport of ice hockey.

Broomball gradually spread internationally over the following decades, and by the 1980s, organized broomball was being played in Australia, Japan, Sweden, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland.

== International governing body ==

The International Federation of Broomball Associations (IFBA) is the world governing body of broomball. Its headquarters are in Canada.

Every two years the IFBA runs the IFBA World Broomball Championships (also known as the Challenge Cup), an international event with teams from around the world. Historically, the championships have been dominated by the North Americans teams.

== International status ==
Broomball has been gaining popularity internationally. The sport is now an established international recreational sport, played in many countries around the world. Canada and the United States are the &quot;powerhouse&quot; nations of the sport, with their local representative teams often battling in prestigious tournaments held annually across North America.

In Japan, some top teams and players are attracted to regular tournaments. Australia holds its annual National Championships in centres across the country and is continually increasing its number of players in a country where ice sports are not considered popular. Switzerland and Italy regularly send representative teams to tournaments in North America. Other broomball nations include Finland, Germany, and Russia.

=== IFBA Rules vs USA Rules ===

There are two main differences between International Federation of Broomball Associations (IFBA) gameplay and American broomball gameplay: the way offside works, and the size of the net. The results of these rules are generally considered to effect the game by making both the score and the pace of play slightly slower under IFBA rules.

====Offside====
Under &quot;IFBA&quot; rules, the red line (center ice) is the only line used to determine offside. Once the offensive team clears the red line, the defense must work to get it back over the same line.

In &quot;American broomball&quot;, a &quot;floating blue line&quot; is employed, meaning the offensive team must pass the blue line, and then the defense must work to get it back over the red line.

====Goalnets====
The other major difference is the size of the goalnets.

* &quot;IFBA&quot; sanctioned games use a net.
* &quot;American broomball&quot; uses nets.

While there are other slight differences, these two are by far the biggest.

==University and college broomball==

Broomball is played at many universities and colleges, mostly in North America. Some leagues are competitive while others function as a social event.

===United States===
In the United States, broomball is played at the following educational institutions:
* Boston University
* Carleton College
* University of Chicago
* Iowa State University
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology
* Miami University
* Michigan State University
* Michigan Technological University
* University of Nebraska-Lincoln
* University of Notre Dame
* Princeton University (intramural sport)
* Rochester Institute of Technology
* University of Texas at Austin
* Yale University

==Moscow broomball==
Broomball is played, with a slightly different ruleset, by expatriates in Moscow.

<doc id="692164" wikidata="Q567079" url="?curid=692164" title="Berlin Jungfernheide station">
<text>Berlin Jungfernheide is a railway station located at Charlottenburg-Nord, in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of Berlin, served by the S-Bahn lines and , the U-Bahn line and Regional-Express trains of the Deutsche Bahn. Its name literally translates into &quot;maidens&#x27; heathland&quot;; it was named after the Jungfernheide, a former large forest in the proximity of this station.

== S-Bahn station ==

The S-Bahn station Jungfernheide was opened in 1894, around 20 years after the tracks were first laid on that stretch. It originally had a single island platform, served by trains of the Berlin Ringbahn. This was supplemented in 1908 by a second platform for suburban trains and then later by a third, built specifically for the new Siemensbahn, which was funded by the company Siemens to serve their plant some distance west of the station.

Following the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, however, services were disrupted and the station was reduced to having two platforms. The station fell into complete disuse after 1980, when passenger numbers fell to unsustainable levels. This situation was intensified by the building of the U-Bahn line , which was essentially a parallel service to the S-Bahn to Spandau.

Following the fall of the Wall, many disused S-Bahn lines were brought back into use. This included the Ringbahn but none of the other routes through Jungfernheide, which therefore reopened with only one platform on 15 April 1997, at which time only the line from the south was in use. It was not until 2002 that the Ringbahn was operated again in its entirety and Jungfernheide enjoyed a status as an important interchange between S-Bahn and U-Bahn, owing to its being served by direct trains from the majority of Berlin&#x27;s central districts.

== U-Bahn station ==

The subway station was opened on 1 October 1980 on the occasion of the commissioning of the route from Rohrdamm to Richard-Wagner-Platz on the . Originally, a changeover to the S-Bahn was planned at this time. However, this had been shut down as a result of the strike of the Reichsbahn two weeks before.

As with other new Berlin U-Bahn buildings of the time, the architect &quot;Rainer Gerhard Rümmler&quot; was responsible for the visual design. The result was decorated with colorful floral motifs fired on ceramic tiles. 

The station is designed with two stacked platforms, as a connection to Tegel Airport (Urban Tech Republic) and Rathaus Reinickendorf was provided by the Urban Ring &quot;U0&quot; and the extended line. For this purpose, the eastern platform edge would have been used on both levels. Today, the trains are stacked in two levels, stopping in the direction of Rudow at the upper platform and at the lower platform in the direction of Rathaus Spandau.

On 17 December 1997, the subway station received an elevator that connects both platforms with the front hall for accessibility reasons.

In one part of the station and the adjoining unused track tunnel the fire-brigade exercise facility of the Berlin subway is located. It was inaugurated on 14 July 2003. The facility is 350 meters long, including a 90-meter smoke chamber. This makes the U5 platforms and tracks totally unusable. The U5 extension was later cancelled and became a tram route. In addition to the BVG-own staff firefighters, police, emergency physicians and Technisches Hilfswerk train in the emergency training center &quot;(Notfallübungscenter (NÜC))&quot; the fire fighting and evacuation. An emergency exit can also be included in the exercises.

== Deutsche Bahn station ==

The part of the station for regional trains was opened on 28 May 2006 along with the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof, which also included a major reorganisation of the train services in and around Berlin. The station is served around half-hourly for most of the day by the Regional-Express line RE4, which runs between Rathenow and Jüterbog, and the RegionalBahn service RB10, from Nauen to Berlin Hbf.

Before the Ringbahn was reactivated in this area, its &quot;platform B&quot; was used in the early 1990s as a terminus for regional trains.

==Rail services==
The station is serves by the following services:

<doc id="692165" wikidata="Q2061038" url="?curid=692165" title="Riviera Maya">
<text>The Riviera Maya () is a tourism and resort district south of Cancun, Mexico. It straddles the coastal Federal Highway 307, along the Caribbean coastline of the state of Quintana Roo, located in the eastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Originally the name applied narrowly, focusing on the area of coastline between the city of Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The designation has since expanded up and down the coast, now including the towns of Puerto Morelos, situated to the north of Playa del Carmen, as well as the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, situated to the south of Tulum. This larger region is what is currently being promoted as part of the Riviera Maya tourist corridor.

Once the area was originally only called the &quot;Cancun–Tulum corridor&quot;, but in 1999 it was renamed as the Riviera Maya, analogous to the Italian and French Riviera, with the instigation of among others, Miguel Ramón Martín Azueta. At the time, he was the municipal president of Solidaridad, Quintana Roo. The Riviera Maya includes the municipalities of Solidaridad in the north and Tulum in the south, and extends approximately inland, to the border with the state of Yucatán.

==Tourism==
The Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale all-inclusive resorts and a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.

Government development plans include establishing a number of medium-sized cities of ~200,000 inhabitants within the Riviera Maya with initial planning spanning 20 years. Target areas for urbanization include the towns and villages of: Puerto Aventuras, Akumal, Chemuyil, and Tulum.

A major attraction throughout the Riviera Maya are coastal and reef aquatic activities dependent on the beaches, coastal water and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (also known as the Belize Barrier Reef) which begins near Cancun and continues along the whole length of the Riviera Maya continuing southward to Guatemala. This barrier reef system is the second longest in the world.

Activities at the most visited locations include jet-skiing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming in cenotes, swimming with dolphins, zip-lining, horse riding, sailing, and guided jungle tours. Archeology is also a big tourist draw in the area, including the popular archeological sites operated by the Instituto Nacional de Archeological such as Tulum on the coast, and Chichen Itza and Coba located some distance inland. The self-named ecoparks of Xcaret and Xel-Ha also include some smaller archeological ruins as part of their attractions, but these natural water theme parks operated by private business consortia attract much larger crowds due to the diversity and range of activities provided, such as swimming with captive dolphins.

==Climate==
The mean annual temperature is . The climate is dominated by a rainy season from May through November, and within the dry season there is a period dominated by northerly winds, called El Norte, which usually occurs in the months of January and February. The maximum mean annual precipitation throughout the Yucatán Peninsula occurs along the coast of the Riviera Maya with of rainfall with a general decline to the NW with only per year or less on the opposite side of the Peninsula. While the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán experiences a large number of tropical storms and hurricanes, the storm tracks and therefore landfalls of these are divergent to both the north (Cancun) and the south (south of Tulum and down to Belize) striking generally outside the Riviera Maya. Groundwater and therefore cenote water temperatures are year round. Coastal waters range from in January to in August.

==Geography==

The Riviera Maya is completely within the state of Quintana Roo on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The terrain is flat and covered by low tropical jungle. The geology is high purity carbonates down to a depth of 0.5–1.5 km below the surface. Mean annual rainfall is 1.5 m per year and the efficient infiltration results in the complete absence of any surface rivers. As is common in karst, underground river networks have formed by dissolution, and these have been explored and mapped by cave diving through sinkhole collapses, locally called cenotes.

The whole of the Yucatán Peninsula is underlain by a density-stratified coastal aquifer system with a lens-shaped freshwater body floating on top of intruding saline water. The formation of caves (speleogenesis) within this coastal carbonate aquifer is principally associated with carbonate dissolution at the fresh-saline water contact within the aquifer. By 2008, the Quintana Roo Speleological Society (QRSS) reported more than of flooded cave passages within the limits of the Riviera Maya including the two longest underwater cave systems in the world of Sac Actun and Ox Bel Ha. These groundwater resources, accessed via the thousands of cenotes throughout the landscape, once supported the Maya civilizations and today remain the only natural sources of potable water in the area.

The Caribbean coastline is a series of crescent shaped white sand beaches interrupted every 1–10 km by rocky headlands and inlets, called s, through which groundwater discharges into the coastal water. Large sections of the extensive mangrove swamps that lie behind the beaches and headlands are included in the areas scheduled for tourism development.

==Transportation==
Most tourists to the Riviera Maya arrive through Cancún International Airport, approximately north of Playa del Carmen.

About north of Tulum, a new international airport was announced. In March 2011, the bidding for construction contracts was to be concluded.

The Tulum International Airport was finally finished in December 2023 and is now open.

In 2018 construction started on the Tren Maya, which would run the length of the Riviera Maya and connect it with other destinations on the Yucatán peninsula.

<text>Biak is the main island of Biak Archipelago located in Cenderawasih Bay near the northern coast of Papua, an Indonesian province, and is just northwest of New Guinea. Biak has many atolls, reefs, and corals.

The largest population centre is at Kota Biak (Biak City) on the south coast. The rest of the island is thinly populated with small villages.

Biak is part of the Biak Islands (&quot;Kepulauan Biak&quot;), and is administered by Biak Numfor Regency.

==Geography==
Biak covers an area of The island is long and wide at its widest point. The highest point is approximately 740 meters elevation, located in the northwest of the island.

The island of Supiori lies close to the northwest, separated from Biak by a narrow, shallow channel. The smaller Padaido Islands lie south and southeast of Biak.

Collectively Biak, Supiori, the Padaido Islands, and the island of Numfor to the southwest are known as the Schouten Islands, also called the Biak Islands or Geelvink Islands. Biak is the largest island in the group, and the most populated. The islands enclose Cenderawasih Bay on the north. The island of Yapen lies south of Biak and the Padaido Islands, separated by a broad channel.

The island is administered by Biak Numfor Regency, which also includes Numfor and the Padaido Islands. The administrative center is at Biak City. Supiori was formerly part of Biak Numfor Regency, but was made a separate regency in 2004.

== History ==
Biak was first sighted by Europeans by the Portuguese navigator Jorge de Menezes in 1526. In his voyage from Malacca to Maluku via northern Borneo, Jorge de Menezes landed at Biak Islands, at the entrance of the Gulf, where he was forced to winter; the island is thenceforth called in Portuguese maps &quot;Ilha de Dom Jorge&quot; or &quot;Ilha onde invernou Dom Jorge&quot;, to become, finally, &quot;Ilha de S. Jorge&quot;.

The Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra sighted the island on 24 June 1528, when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. Another sighting was later reported in 1545 by Spanish navigator Íñigo Ortiz de Retes on board of galleon &quot;San Juan&quot; when also attempting the return to New Spain

The archipelago was first mapped in the Portuguese charts of Gaspar Viegas (c. 1537), an anonymous map of 1540, and on the maps of João de Lisboa and of Bartolomeu Velho (c. 1560), and by other Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch maps.

In World War II, a strategic airfield of the Imperial Japanese Army was located there, serving as a base for operations in the Pacific theatre. American forces eventually captured the island during the Battle of Biak. The captured airfield was renamed Mokmer Airfield and later transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force. Biak became the second landing of allied forces after Hollandia. Many Biak islanders received supplies from allied forces such as clothes and foods.

To restore Dutch rule after the war they reopened schools and re-employed graduates from teacher schools in Miei. Some Biak islanders including Frans Kaisieppo, Eduard Rumbrar, Markus Kaisiepo, Marttinus Rumayau, and Lukas Rumkorem were educated in &quot;Bestuur&quot; schools. By September 1945, Lukas Rumkorem founded Perserikatan Indonesia Merdeka (PIM), the first political party in Biak which held meetings during September and November in Nusi and from January 1946 in Bosnek. Although Rumkorem&#x27;s activity would be found out by &quot;Hoofd Plaatselik Bestuur&quot; (HPB), no further action would be taken as the HPB went on sick leave until the resident found out. By the middle of 1947, Lukas Rumkorem would be captured by Dutch authority accused of trying to kill Frans Kaisiepo and Marcus Kaisiepo. De Bruijn as district leader of Biak would reorganised and formed regional council &quot;Kakain Karkara&quot; on 20 November 1947 to rebuild villages which were destroyed after &quot;Koreri&quot; movements against social changes brought by outsiders.

In his administration de Bruijn had a right hand man by the name of Stefanus Yoseph which was formerly under the employ of Japanese and met de Bruijn during his employment in Wissel Lakes (Paniai), Stefanus Yoseph was entrusted as warden in Biak, during which he stayed with Petero Jandi a Makassarese working as woodworker in HPB office. According to Stefanus, Petero Jandi was an Indonesian nationalist extremist (with links with Polongbangkeng group from South Sulawesi) which was captured and exiled to Biak. When Solait the &quot;bestuurassistent&quot; was on holiday in Ambon, Stefanus was chosen as &quot;bestuurassistent&quot;. During this time they supported two prisoners, Hermanus Rumere and Ambonese named Watti which led an attack on ammunition depot and Biak prison on 14 March 1948. Another important figure in this rebellion was Hanoch Rumbrar a clerk in HPB office, which became the intermediary between civilians and Petero Jandi&#x27;s movement in garnering support and campaign from January to 10 March to become part of &#x27;Sukarno&#x27;s Republic&#x27;. They gained some support however some rejected not because they were pro-Dutch but afraid of similar retaliation during Manseren incident (1942-1943). This movement also tried to coordinate with Silas Papare&#x27;s PKII particularly with Saleh, Ratulangi&#x27;s exiled assistant in Serui. A week before this rebellion de Bruijn was on official travel. The plan was to attack KNIL garrison in Sorido followed with attack to central radio station and KNIL military post in Boruku field and Mokmer to gain weapons and free prisoners in Serui before invading Manokwari and Sorong. The rebellion did not go to plan and led to shootouts as one of local Biak youth, Terrianus shot Dutch Sergeant Schipper. By Monday, Stefanus Yoseph was captured, followed by Petero Jandi, Hanoch Rumbrar, and others the next day. Around 40 rebels would be captured and brought to Cipinang prison in Jakarta and released in the 1950s. Petero Jandi would receive capital punishment in Hollandia while others holdouts in jungle, like Petrus Korwa and Hanoch Rumbrar were sent to Digul.

PIM activities would resume after the arrival of Corinus Krey from Hollandia on 7 August 1949. On 1 October 1949, there would be a meeting in the home of Yenures village leader, David Rumaropen to reorganise PIM and formally reactivated on 5 October 1949 in Bosnik, in the home of Lukas Rumkorem, with him as leader, Corinus Krey as deputy and J. Tarumaselly as advisor and Petrus Warikar as secretary. By 1958, a new movement led by Lukas Rumkorem was formed called Tentara Tjadangan Tjenderawasih (TTT), which according to J. Tarumaselly had branches in other region of Papua. This organisation sent some papuan youths to undergo military training outside Biak which was planned to guide Indonesia infiltration forces. TTT also made contacts with Indonesia Consulate General in Singapore to utilise Chinese-Indonesian as they move more freely with KPM ships other activities include surveillance of potential important locations in Biak by J. Tarumaselly and T. Rumngeur which was sent to Indonesian representatives in Singapore, Ambon, Hollandia, and Serui. TTT activities would be stopped after Dutch authorities found out and captured David Woisiri, Rafael Maselkosu, J. Tarumaselly, Jonathan Saroy, and Frits Werluken member of TTT branch of Serui.

It was transferred from Dutch rule, along with half of New Guinea, to Indonesia in the 1960s. On 15 August 1962, New York Agreement was signed, which contained provision for Penentuan Pendapat Rakyat. From 29 September to 19 October 1962, there was a papuan delegations consisting of 19 members to visit Indonesian regions and meet with Sukarno in Jakarta. Another delegations from papuan regions consisted of 34 people declare their oaths for Indonesia, among these Biak sent 2 delegates, Ds. F.J.S. Rumainum and Frans Kaisiepo. Another declaration from education employees delegates consisted of 16 people with Biak represented by L. Manidbodibo and N. Urbinas.

On 1 July 1998, the anniversary of the unsuccessful 1971 Papuan declaration of independence, Biak was the scene of what is commonly known as the &#x27;Biak Massacre&#x27; or &#x27;Bloody Biak&#x27;. Members of the &quot;Organisasi Papua Merdeka&quot; (Free Papua Movement), raised &#x27;The Morning Star&#x27;, at Kota Biak water tower and camped there for the next six days.

At 05:30 on 6 July 1998, the demonstration was fired upon by the &quot;Tentara Nasional Indonesia&quot; (TNI or Indonesian Military). Many were shot while attempting to flee. Survivors were rounded up and forced to the docks where they were kept for several days while further demonstrators were caught.

About 200 of the original demonstrators were forcibly loaded onto two Indonesian naval vessels and taken to two different locations to be thrown into the ocean. In the following days, bodies washed up on Biak&#x27;s shores, or were snarled in fishing nets. The TNI explained that the bodies turning up belonged to victims of the Aitape tsunami which occurred approximately away in Papua New Guinea.

== Demographics ==

The people of Biak are predominantly Melanesians, though speaking predominantly Austronesian languages and the main religion is Christianity.

In Biak and surrounding regions, many titles relating to jobs in Tidore Sultanate administration became used as clan and family names, which include &quot;Korano&quot; or &quot;Kolano&quot; (ultimately from Javanese &quot;Klono&quot; in Panji), &quot;Sanadi&quot; or &quot;Sangaji&quot; (district leader), &quot;Mayor&quot; which had job to deliver tribute to Tidore. &quot;Dimara&quot; (village leader), military leaders such as &quot;Kapitarau&quot; (sea captain) and &quot;Kapisa&quot; (captain), as well as numerous names with starting element of &quot;Rum-&quot; such as Rumbiak, Rumbewas, Rumbekwan, have origin in Tidore language, as &quot;Rum&quot; referred to specific area in palace of Tidore.

However due to extensive foreign trading relationship Biak and Yapen islands as well as the Yondama bay host a sizeable descendant of foreign traders. This can be seen with these islands has the largest local Chinese-descent population in Papua provinces. They have intermarried with locals for generations and sometimes took on local family name. Proof of extensive foreign tradings also include various local traditions involving Chinese porcelains, such as &quot;Mansorandak&quot; tradition of stepping on a plate after going back from long voyage.

The official language is Indonesian and the main local language is Biak. Other languages such as English are also used, but limited. Administratively there are 12 kecamatan, covering only the island itself, having 122,166 people in the 2020 census.

==Climate==


Biak features a tropical rainforest climate with nearly identical temperatures throughout the course of the year. The average annual temperature in the city is , which is also generally the average temperature of each day in Biak. The city sees a good amount of precipitation in every month throughout the course of the year, averaging roughly of precipitation per year. Its driest months November, average a little under of rain per month.

==Economy==

The island is relatively rural and most Papuans on the island subsist off the land, primarily by fishing or gathering. It has large reserves of copper and nickel. 
For generations, most Papuans have inherited &quot;customary claims&quot; to parcels of land that they live off of and these property rights are defended by both the property&#x27;s owner and possibly also the property owner&#x27;s clan.

==Transport==
Biak is served by Frans Kaisiepo Airport, which has flights from all over Indonesia.

Biak lies at latitude 1 degree south of the equator and consequently, any rockets launched from the island would require less fuel to reach Earth&#x27;s orbit and enter into a geocentric orbit than had the same rocket been launched further away from the equator. The equatorial location offers particularly efficient launches to equatorial and near-equatorial orbits; facing eastward toward the Pacific Ocean reduces the downrange risks of launch. 
, space satellite launch services had been planned for the new Biak Spaceport.

== Tradition ==

The Biak Numfor culture revolves around their ancient animist religion, although today they are Christian as well.

Their beliefs revolve around a ritual ceremony called Wor, where they will be plagued by all kinds of bad luck and sickness. The Wor is in all aspect of their life and some of their traditional ceremonies are still being held now. They include the first hair cut ceremony (Wor Kapapnik), the growing up ceremony (Wor Famarmar) and the Wedding ceremony (Wor Yakyaker Farbakbuk). All of these ceremonies are accompanied by singing, dancing and offering to ancestral spirits.

=== Yosim Pancar Dance ===

The Biak Numfor have a friendship dance called &quot;Yosim Pancar&quot; which is popular across West Papua and coastal Papua. Its small to mid-size dance group formations could last all-night long. Several &quot;Yosim Pancar&quot; moves that are popular till this day are: Pancar Gas, Gale-Gale, Jef, Pacul Tiga, Seka, and Poco-poco adaptation.

This dance is an amalgamation of two traditional dances namely &quot;Yosim&quot; dances originating from the bay of Sairei (Serul, Waropen) and Pancar dances originating from Biak, Numfor and Manokwari. The musical instruments used for Yosim usually used are cuku lele (Ukulele), and guitars which shows foreign influences as these were not instruments from Papua. Included was also local bass made from three strings, with the strings made from Pandan leaves. As well as Kalabasa, a dried Calabash, which was then filled with beads. In &quot;Yosim&quot; dance, the women are dressed with weavings to cover the chest, and headress made from bird feathers. While the men are bare-chested and wearing the same headress. The dance movement are more energetic though simple. In &quot;Pancar&quot; dance, the music are from Tifa drums which is the universal instruments for coastal Papuans. The drum skin is usually made from soa-soa (lizards). The movements are more stiff following the Tifa beats.

Movements include Seka, this dance movement are usually from southern coast with famous version from Kaimana, Fakfak, and Timika. In Pacul Tiga, or Pancar Meneru the dancer swing forward three steps, and throw both arms and one leg to the left and right, which was then repeated for the other leg. Jef movements are influenced by rock and roll dance from 1969-1971, Gale-Gale movements are from Wondama Bay and Mor-Mambor islands. Pancar movements are performed by the dancers move in a circle. These movements was inspired by animals, and have four variations.

The rhythm and song of Yosim Pancar dance are now being modernized with special effect sounds and pop dance beat. Originally the rhythm is to summon ancestral spirits and let them join the group. The traditional musical instrument of this dance is a self-made string bass from coconut tree and roots which is similar to the guitar or ukulele.

== Flora and fauna ==
The rain forest-covered Biak Islands have been designated the Biak–Numfoor rain forests, especially as they have the largest number of endemic bird species of any single area in the New Guinea region. There are also numerous reptile and amphibian species found here. Among the many snake species catalogued by Tom Mendelson during his herpetological survey of Biak in the 1990s, the green tree python (&quot;Morelia viridis&quot;) and the amethystine python (&quot;Morelia amethystina&quot;) were quite common. The Biak glider is a recently reclassified gliding possum species, formerly considered a sugar glider subspecies.

There are numerous types of flora in the tropical rain forest of the island, including a variety of trees and other commercially important species plus the lush vegetation of mangrove swamps. The recently discovered palm tree &quot;Manjekia maturbongsii&quot; is endemic to Biak.

<text>Flora Fountain is a Fountain located at the Hutatma Chowk is an ornamentally sculpted architectural heritage monument located at the southern end of the historic Dadabhai Naoroji Road, at the Fort business district in the heart of South Mumbai, Mumbai, India. Flora Fountain, built in 1864, depicts the Roman goddess Flora. It was built at a total cost of Rs. 47,000, or 9,000 pounds sterling, a large sum in those days.

==History==
The fountain originally intended for the Victoria Gardens, is now surmounted by the figure of Plenty (&quot;Courtesy of Special Collections, University of Houston Libraries.&quot;). History of the Flora Fountain is traced to the time when the Old Mumbai Fort was demolished in 1860 as part of the then Governor, Sir Bartle Frère&#x27;s efforts to improve civic sanitation (municipal improvements) and the urban space requirements of the growing city. Prior to this demolition, the Fort had been built between 1686 and 1743 by the British East India Company with three gates (the Apollo Gate, the Church Gate and the Bazaar Gate), a moat, esplanade, level open spaces on its western fringe (to control fires) and residences. A small road called the Hornby Road, named after the then Governor of Bombay (Mumbai) between 1771 AD and 1784 AD, also existed at the old Fort area. Consequent to the demolitions, the Hornby road was widened into a broad avenue and on its western side commercial plots were developed to build new commercial buildings in Neo Classical and Gothic Revival designs. The Dadabhai Naoroji Road (D. N. Road), developed into a veritable sight of colonial splendor with Crawford Market linked to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus anchoring the northern end and the Flora Fountain, forming the southern end of the Mile Long Road.

The Flora Fountain was erected at the exact place where the Church gate (named after St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai ) stood before its demolition along with the Mumbai Fort. It was constructed by the Agri–Horticultural Society of Western India, out of a donation of Rs 20,000 by Cursetjee Fardoonjee Parekh. Designed by Richard Norman Shaw, it was sculpted in imported Portland stone by James Forsythe. A white coat of oil paint has to some extent marred the antiquity of the structure.
The fountain was originally to be named after Sir Bartle Frère, the Governor of Bombay at the time, whose progressive policy had resulted in many of the great public buildings of Mumbai. However, the name was changed before the fountain was unveiled as Flora Fountain, named after Flora, a Roman Goddess of flowers and the season of spring; her majestic and pretty Portland stone statue adorns the top of the fountain. The four corners of the fountain have four life-sized female mythological figures carrying foliage to represent the four seasons.

The fountain was originally intended to be built at the Jijamata Udyaan at Byculla but, in 1908, the grass plot and the palm trees that had camouflaged the fountain were cleared for creating space for pedestrians and horse–traffic between the tram lines and the kerb of the fountain.

==Hutatma chowk==
From the time the Flora Fountain was built in 1864 and until 1960, the chowk (square) where five streets meet (hence, also known as the Piccadilly Circus of Mumbai) and the fountain stands now, was named as the Flora Fountain area. But in 1960, to commemorate the people who laid their lives in the turbulent birth of Maharashtra State at the square, it was renamed as the Hutatma Chowk with a stone statue bearing a pair of torch-holding patriots. The Flora Fountain, surrounded by the British Victorian era heritage buildings, is very much part of the chowk and has been declared a heritage structure and it continues to charm visitors with its beauty and with its spray of water. It sits well alongside the Hutatma statue which adorns the chowk. (Picture depicts the two structures). It was the decision of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly that recommended to the &quot;Government to take necessary steps to erect as early as possible a memorial at Flora Fountain in Bombay in commemoration of the sacrifices of the persons who died on the police firing at Flora Fountain in Bombay in the month of November 1955.&quot;

==Nostalgia==

Nostalgic writing by a cricketer, an unnamed resident of Mumbai who played street cricket in front of the fountain in his youth, reads that the fountain at the centre of the Mumbai city evokes feelings:

&quot;The Centres of the world are well etched in the mind: the New York City&#x27;s Time Square and the Paris&#x27;s Champs-Élysées, London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus. Even now I feel a curious magic about Mumbai&#x27;s Flora Fountain. We called it the heart of the city and so it was.&quot;
==Poetic expression==
A poem in Marathi language by Niranajan Bhagat translated to English extols the beauty of the Flora Fountain thus:

A Glass and concrete jungle;
In its midst always 
Quiet, comely,
With hope filled face, 
she stands
Flora
A dream of spring in her matchless eyes, 
holding in both hands stone flowers.
About her, in all corners,
Iron butterflies fly round and round
And lifeless insects play

<text>Lower Navarre (; Gascon/Bearnese: &quot;Navarra Baisha&quot;; ; ) is a traditional region of the present-day French &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Atlantiques. It corresponds to the northernmost &quot;region&quot; of the Kingdom of Navarre during the Middle Ages. After the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre (1512–24), this &quot;merindad&quot; was restored to the rule of the native king, Henry II. Its capitals were Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and Saint-Palais. In the extreme north there was the little sovereign Principality of Bidache, with an area of and a decreasing population of 44,450 (in 1901), 25,356 (in 1990).

Although this denomination is not completely correct from the historical point of view, it is also known as &quot;Merindad de Ultrapuertos&quot; (&quot;the regions beyond the mountain passes&quot;) by the southerners, and &quot;Deça-ports&quot; (&quot;this side of the mountain passes&quot;) by the Gascon-speakers. Despite its lost administrative cohesion, the memory of its past heyday has left an imprint on its inhabitants, who keep identifying themselves as Lower Navarrese and therefore Navarrese. The &quot;Nafarroaren Eguna&quot; or Day of Navarre is a festival held in Baigorri every year to strengthen their bonds and celebrate their Basque identity as one of the seven constituent regions of the Basque Country.

==Geography==
Lower Navarre is a collection of valleys in the foothills of the Pyrenees. The Aldudes valley, around the town of Saint-Étienne-de-Baïgorry in the south of Lower Navarre, preserves many old traditions, with houses of pink sandstone and contests of &quot;Force Basque&quot;, the basque traditional strength sports. The Irouléguy wines are produced in the area around the town of Irouléguy.

The river Nive rises in Lower Navarre and flows through the province and on to Bayonne, where it meets the Adour. Beyond Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port itself, the Nive enters the Ossès valley, with many beautiful old houses with carved lintels in the villages of Ossès, Irissarry and Bidarray. A reserve for the pottok, the wild Basque Pyrenean pony, in the valley conserves this rare breed. The Baigura massif towers over the western valleys and sets a natural boundary with the rolling valleys of Labourd.

North of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port is the Mixe region around the town of Saint-Palais, a former Navarrese capital. Although close to Béarn, Basque influence and traditions are strong. Lower Navarrese is a dialect of the Basque language spoken in the region. Just south of Saint-Palais, the three principal routes to Compostela on the Way of St James met at the hamlet of Ostabat, bringing much wealth and trade to the area in medieval times.

The Way of St James headed south from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port towards the mountain pass above Orreaga. Pilgrims travelled across the Cize region of Lower Navarre on their way to Navarre across the mountains. In these rolling hills, ewes&#x27; milk cheese, &quot;pur brebis&quot;, is commonly made, including Ossau-Iraty cheese. Villages like Estérençuby and Lecumberry are popular for agro-tourism and the Irati beech forest on the frontier borderline is known for its views and history. Dolmens and other neolithic monuments dot the landscape, including the Tour d&#x27;Urkulu high in the mountains at 1,149m—a 2,000-year-old circular platform of huge stone blocks. Lower Navarre is well delimited by mountain ranges on the west (with Mount Iparla as its highest and most iconic landmark), south (Orreaga, Mount Urkulu and Pyrenees altogether) and the east (bounded by the western mountains of Zuberoa).

==History==
The lands of the Lower Navarre were part of the Duchy of Vasconia that turned into Gascony by the end of the first millennium. At the time of King Sancho III of Navarre &quot;The Great&quot; (died in 1035), Duke Sancho VI William of Gascony pledged allegiance to the Navarrese king, for a short period Gascony becoming vassal to the Kingdom of Navarre, with which it had always had close ties. Moreover, the valleys of Baigorri, Ossès, Cize and Arberoa were attached to the latter, establishing the first nucleus of the Navarrese grip on the lands north of the Pyrenees. While these valleys were taken over again by Gascony for a period, the Ultrapuertos County (called &quot;Merindad&quot; in Navarre) was regained for Navarre in 1234, coming to be governed by the sheriff of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. However, the definite boundaries were not established until the 1244-1245 war between the Labourdins and Navarrese came to an end.

In 1512, the Duke of Alba, under orders from King Ferdinand II of Aragon, conquered Navarre, including Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. The Navarrese monarchs retreated to their sovereign domain of Béarn. In 1516, King John III of Navarre retook the town of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, but failed to take the citadel; he and Queen Catherine died soon after, and the 10,000 mercenary army of the spanish Emperor Charles V recovered control of the town. Charles V&#x27;s troops retained Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port and its hinterland, besides devastating the region, but were met with strong resistance led by local lords loyal to King Henry II of Navarre. The latter succeeded in taking over the town and its castle in May 1521, losing it to the Duke of Alba in June; the spanish evacuated Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in 1522, but recovered it in January 1524. While possession of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port was hotly contested, Saint-Palais (Donapaleu in Basque) remained out of spanish reach and would become the main royal center of the surviving Navarrese monarchy in Lower Navarre. 

Eventually, the legitimate Navarrese king (&quot;de facto&quot; deprived of the rest of Navarre by Aragon-Castilian usurpation), restored Navarrese official institutions and bodies in Lower Navarre, e.g. the Sovereign Council in 1523, the Chancery in 1524, the Royal Mint a little later in Saint-Palais, etc. In 1525, a new military inroad led by the spanish viceroy of Navarre subdued the region, and tried to earn the loyalty of the nobles, but they unanimously kept their allegiance to the Navarrese monarchs of the House of Albret, and the lord of Luxa and the lord of Miossens, Esteban d&#x27;Albret, reconquered the region in 1527. Although Emperor Charles V, the spanish monarch, recovered Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port within months, by 1528 he had lost interest in asserting and maintaining his control over the portion of Navarre north of the Pyrenees, difficult to hold and defend. Accordingly, he abandoned his remaining holdings in Lower Navarre, including Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, to its hereditary king Henry II, as part of a treaty with France—the Treaty of Cambray in 1530. In 1555, Henry II of Navarre died and was succeeded by his daughter Jeanne, who ruled until her death in 1572.

During the 16th century the Albrets ruled over a wider territory (Béarn, etc. as French vassals) and the effective seat of the Navarrese Royalty shifted to Pau, capital city of Béarn, where Henry III (later Henry IV of France), the son of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret was born. Henry III generally respected the laws issued by the Navarrese parliament, despite sometimes raising objections to their wordings. Henry succeeded to the French throne in 1589; he and his successors would now be titled &quot;King of France and Navarre.&quot; His son Louis II (Louis XIII of France) was definitely reluctant to any binding reading of the Navarrese laws, and forced more loose wordings, devoid of specific meaning in order to feel his hands free. Ultimately this led to an encroaching French centralization of all relevant decisions and prerogatives during the 17 and 18th centuries.

In 1620 and 1624 respectively the House of Commons and the Justice system were merged with those of Béarn and transferred from Saint-Palais to Pau, despite protests voiced by the Navarrese representatives, who pointed to their different traditions and languages—Basque and Béarnese. The title of King of Navarre continued to be held by the lineage of the Albrets and the Bourbons up to the French Revolution, while the kingdom itself merged with France in 1620. It retained its historic personality as a kingdom and, albeit fragmented, a separate legal status. The two third estate representatives of Lower Navarre did not vote at the States-General of 1789 and its follow-up, the French National Assembly (1790), arguing that the impending new administrative arrangement was none of their business, since they did not belong in the Kingdom of France. All the same, the new French administrative design did not spare Lower Navarre. It came to be integrated in the Basses-Pyrénées department along with the rest of French Basque districts, and Béarn.

== Administration of Lower Navarre, Ancien Régime ==
The administration of the independent Kingdom of Navarre after 1512 was centralized in Saint-Palais and consisted of a handful of institutions organized in a structure generally found in the Kingdom of France. By 1527 these administrations had been partially decentralized to Pau, and consisted of:

* the Governor of Navarre and Béarn
* Estates of Navarre (French: &quot;États de Navarre&quot;), in Saint-Palais
* Chancery of Navarre, in Saint-Palais
* Chambre des Comptes of Navarre, in Pau, Nérac and Vendôme
* Mint of Navarre and Béarn (French: &quot;Monnaie de Navarre et Béarn&quot;), formed by the merger &quot;Mint of Navarre&quot; in Saint-Palais, with the mints of Béarn in Pau and Morlaàs, in Béarn, by the Chambre des Comptes of Navarre, in Pau
* Conseil Souverain of Navarre and Béarn, the predecessor of the Parliament of Navarre and Béarn, in Pau
* Conseil Privé, the King&#x27;s private council for Navarre and Béarn, in Pau

<doc id="692193" wikidata="Q6468838" url="?curid=692193" title="President of Slovakia">
<text>The president of the Slovak Republic () serves as the head of state of Slovakia and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The people directly elect the president for five years, for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The presidency is essentially a ceremonial office, but the president exercises certain limited powers with absolute discretion. Their official residence is the Grassalkovich Palace in Bratislava.

==History==
The office was established by the constitution of Slovakia on 1 January 1993, when Slovakia permanently split from Czechoslovakia and became independent. The office was vacant until 2 March, when the first president, Michal Kováč, was elected by the National Council of Slovak Republic. However, in 1998, the National Council could not elect a successor to Kováč. As a result, the position was vacant for half a year after Kováč&#x27;s term ended in March 1998. The duties and powers of the office devolved upon the then-prime minister and speaker of the National Council. To resolve the issue, the constitution was changed to provide for the popular election of the president. Presidential elections have been held in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, and 2024.

Peter Pellegrini is the current president, taking office on 15 June 2024.

==Role and powers==

The president of Slovakia has a limited role in policy-making, as the office is largely ceremonial within the framework of a parliamentary republic. According to the constitution, the president is the supreme representative of the state both in Slovakia and abroad.

The president represents the Slovak Republic externally and concludes and ratifies international treaties. The president may delegate to the government or, with the government&#x27;s consent, to individual members of the Slovak Republic, the conclusion of international treaties. Historically, all Slovak presidents delegated this power to the government which has been done by Decision of President No. 250/2001 Coll. (which superseded Decision of President No. 205/1993 Coll.).

Among the president&#x27;s constitutional powers are nominating and appointing the prime minister. The constitution does not limit the president&#x27;s choice; through their decisions, the president ensures the due performance of constitutional bodies. Because the government of whoever is appointed prime minister must receive a vote of confidence in parliament, the president usually appoints the winning party or coalition leader in parliamentary elections.

The president has sole discretion to appoint three members of the judicial council, one member of the Budget Council, and two members of the council of the Nation&#x27;s Memory Institute; to award distinctions, to appoint the president and vice-president of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic (from among the Constitutional Court judges), and to grant pardon or parole. They can veto any bill or proposal by the National Council, except for constitutional amendments. This veto can be overridden if the National Council passes the same bill again with a majority of all council members, so this power is considered relatively weak.
The president is formally the commander-in-chief of the Slovak armed forces, but this role is ceremonial because by the constitution when the president acts as the commander-in-chief, their decision is valid only after it is signed by the prime minister or a minister authorized by the prime minister.

Among their other constitutional duties are signing bills into law, appointing ministers on the prime minister&#x27;s recommendation, and appointing various other state officials, such as generals, professors, judges, rectors, and prosecutors.

The president has discretionary power over the appointments of some officials. For example, there have been cases when the president has refused to appoint vice-governors of the National Bank of Slovakia recommended by the government. These actions of the president were confirmed by the Constitutional Court.

Presidential powers are substantially increased in special circumstances when the National Council passes a vote of no confidence in the government. In such a case, many executive powers of government (e.g., appointment of officials, foreign trips, signing treaties) are subject to the president&#x27;s approval, and the president can appoint the government without being subject to the parliament&#x27;s approval.

<doc id="692194" wikidata="Q1456119" url="?curid=692194" title="Pitt Rivers Museum">
<text>Pitt Rivers Museum is a museum displaying the archaeological and anthropological collections of the University of Oxford in England. The museum is located to the east of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and can only be accessed through that building.

The museum was founded in 1884 by Augustus Pitt Rivers, who donated his private collection to the University of Oxford with the condition that a permanent lecturer in anthropology must be appointed. Edward Burnett Tylor thereby became the first lecturer in anthropology in the UK following his appointment to the post of Reader in Anthropology in 1885. Museum staff are still involved in teaching archaeology and anthropology at the university. The first curator of the museum was Henry Balfour. A second stipulation in the Deed of Gift was that a building should be provided to house the collection and used for no other purpose. The university therefore engaged Thomas Manly Deane, son of Thomas Newenham Deane who, together with Benjamin Woodward, had designed and built the original Oxford University Museum of Natural History building three decades earlier, to create an adjoining building at the rear of the main building to house the collection. Construction started in 1885 and was completed in 1886.

The original donation consisted of approximately 22,000 items; this has now grown to more than 600,000 items, including major photographic holdings, nearly of which has been acquired via donation by colonial officials, travellers, scholars, and missionaries.

==Organization==
The main exhibition space in the museum&#x27;s building is a large, rectangular, colonnaded room. It has two mezzanine levels and a massive, vaulted ceiling, and is brimming with glass display cases and exhibits.

The museum&#x27;s collection is arranged typologically, according to how the objects were used, rather than according to their age or origin. The display of many examples of a particular type of tool or artifact, showing historical and regional variations, is an unusual and distinct feature of this museum. This topological layout is based upon Pitt Rivers&#x27; theories; he intended for his collection to show progression in design and evolution in human culture from the simple to the complex. Although this evolutionary approach to material culture is no longer appropriate in the modern display paradigm for archaeological and anthropological objects, the museum has broadly retained the original typological organization due to the Pitt Rivers Deed of Gift which stipulated that any changes to the displays &quot;shall not affect the general principle originated by Augustus Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers&quot;.

As the museum has an extensive collection of objects, those on display are changed periodically.

The museum was closed from 17 March 2020 to 22 September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this closure, a decision was made to remove displays of shrunken heads as well as other human remains. The museum&#x27;s director issued a statement, &quot;Exhibiting Tsantsas (shrunken heads) reinforced racist and stereotypical thinking that goes against the museum’s core values.” The shrunken heads had been on display since the 1940s.

==The Haida Totem Pole==
The largest object on display in the museum is the Haida house post, a totem pole, which has a height of 11.36m. It originally stood in front of the Star House in the village of Old Massett (Haida name Uttewas), on Graham Island, in British Columbia, Canada. The Star House belonged to Chief Anetlas (c.1816–1893); it is thought that the house was constructed in 1882. The pole was purchased by Edward Burnett Tylor and transported to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1901.

==Photo gallery==
==Expansion==
Despite the Pitt Rivers being so full as to be &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;, designs for a new museum building in the 1960s were never realised. By 1964, the university wanted to expand the science area onto the Pitts Rivers site and move the museum to a larger plot on Banbury Road. A round museum was proposed, covering a site larger than the Sheldonian Theatre, the Clarendon Building, and the Bodleian Library combined. The concept was strongly supported by the museum&#x27;s curator Bernard Fagg and, after concerted lobbying from Fagg, the university&#x27;s Standing Committee on Museums and Galleries. In February 1966, the university greenlit the new museum and promised to keep the Banbury Road site free for three years while funding was arranged. Several architects were considered for the project including Leslie Martin (who was already working on plans for a new zoology building), Powell &amp; Moya, and Pier Luigi Nervi; Nervi was selected and planning applications were submitted and approved by Oxford City Council in a 32-29 vote. The new museum needed £4.5 million to cover construction costs and £2.25 million as an endowment. In May 1968, Fagg suffered a stroke which left him in hospital until the end of the academic year and significantly limited his involvement in fundraising efforts. By 1970, the campaign had lost momentum, the fundraising committee dissolved, and in September, the university announced the project would be shelved.

In 2004, the museum received £3,700,000 from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to build an annex adjoining the museum. Building work was completed in 2007, bringing the academic staff of the museum back to the site, and providing a laboratory for conservation of the specimens.

A second phase of development began on 7 July 2008 necessitating the closure of the museum and galleries. The museum reopened on 1 May 2009. In this work, the 1960s exhibition gallery was dismantled, restoring the original view through to the museum&#x27;s totem pole. Original display cases were returned to their original place at the front of the museum. The space upstairs vacated by these cases provides additional space for a Clore Duffield Education Centre. A new entrance platform was built to allow visitors to enter on the same level as the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and improves access for wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs. The entrance platform provides re-located shop and reception areas. An environmental control system was also installed.

== Multaka network ==
In 2019, the museum joined six similar museums in Germany, Italy, Greece and Switzerland, creating the international Multaka network. This intercultural museum project organizes guided tours for refugees and migrants designed and offered for free by specially trained Arabic-speaking Multaka guides. The visitor-centered discussions with migrants in their language are focused on the historical origin and history of acquisition of cultural objects, including the visitors&#x27; own understanding of their country&#x27;s cultural heritage.

==Awards==
The Pitt Rivers Museum, along with the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, won &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s award for Family Friendly Museum of 2005. In 2019, the Pitt Rivers Museum was finalist of the Art Fund Museum of the Year Award.

== Colonial legacy ==
In recent years, the Pitt Rivers Museum has been called sector-leading in its work on decoloniality. Further details can be found on the website.[Expansion needed]

In September 2020, the museum announced it had made a number of critical changes to its displays, including the removal from display of human remains and the installation of a new Introductory Case as an intervention in its permanent galleries that engages with the colonial legacy of the museum. The changes attracted worldwide attention as they involved the removal of the museum&#x27;s collection of shrunken heads, which had been on display since the 1940s, citing the reason that &quot;the displays reinforced racist and stereotypical thinking that goes against the museum’s values today&quot;. The museum has also said that it would make changes to the labels to include stories &quot;through the voices of artists and indigenous leaders&quot;.

As part of this process the Pitt Rivers Museum is meeting with originating communities to address errors and gaps in the information it stores, and to discuss repatriation. One of these is the Living Cultures initiative, a collaboration between the museum, a Maasai community based campaign group called Oltoilo Le Maa, and community development organisation InsightShare. Additionally, the museum, together with the Museum of Natural History, returned the remains of 17 Aboriginal Australians to the Australian government in 2022.

== 2024 Pro-Palestine Encampments ==

Beginning on May 6th, pro-Palestine demonstrators under the name Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) occupied the lawn of the University Museum of Natural History and Pitt Rivers Museum, demanding Oxford University enter negotiations about severing institutional relationships facilitating &quot;the genocide and occupation of the Palestinian people.&quot; This followed the nationwide movement in the US of pro-Palestine sit-ins and encampments protesting the escalating violence of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. In response, the University did not commit to the protestors demands but affirmed their right to protest and freedom of speech. Ultimately, following escalations involving die-ins and a second encampment outside the Radcliffe Camera and a series of marches, Oxford University began clearing the lawn encampment to be reopened for public use, and blocked entry to the space with metal fences. They cited &quot;proactive measures to protect the lawn&quot; and removed the recently created &quot;Gaza Memorial Garden&quot; planted there.

<doc id="692197" wikidata="Q1302778" url="?curid=692197" title="Dual carriageway">
<text>A dual carriageway (BrE) or a divided highway (AmE) is a class of highway with carriageways for traffic travelling in opposite directions separated by a central reservation (BrE) or median (AmE). Roads with two or more carriageways which are designed to higher standards with controlled access are generally classed as motorways, freeways, etc., rather than dual carriageways.

A road without a central reservation is known as a single carriageway regardless of how many lanes there are. Dual carriageways have improved road traffic safety over the years and over single carriageways and typically have higher speed limits as a result. In some places, express lanes and local or collector lanes are used within a local-express-lane system to provide more capacity and to smooth out traffic flows for longer-distance travel.

==History==
A very early (perhaps the first) example of a dual carriageway was the &quot;Via Portuensis&quot;, built in the first century by the Roman emperor Claudius between Rome and its harbor of &quot;Portus&quot;. The route between the city and the port experienced a great deal of commercial and pedestrian traffic, as Portus served as the primary avenue for the grain shipments of the &quot;Cura Annonae&quot; into Rome, as well as transporting the majority of goods imported from across the Mediterranean world. This influx of road activity necessitated the construction of a dual thoroughfare as the road approached the &quot;Porta Portese&quot;, the corresponding gate in the Aurelian Walls of Rome for the &quot;Via Portuensis&quot;.

One claim for the first divided highway in the United States was Savery Avenue in Carver, Massachusetts, first built in 1860, where the two roadways were separated by a narrow strip of trees down the middle. In 1907 the Long Island Motor Parkway opened, and roughly 20% of it featured a semi-dual-carriageway design. The New York City Belt Parkway system, which was built between 1907 and 1934, also pioneered the same design. However the majority of it featured concrete or brick railings as lane dividers instead of grass medians.

In the year of 1924 the first Italian &quot;autostrada&quot; was opened running from Milan to Varese. It featured a broad road bed and did not feature lane dividers except near cities and through the mountains.

The London end of the Great West Road became Britain&#x27;s first dual carriageway when it was opened in 1925 by King George V.

In 1927 the Rome bypass was opened. It ran bypassing Rome to the east. Almost the entire length featured a dual-carriageway design. In the early 1930s, it was extended southward all the way to Naples and northward to Florence. Most of the original routing was destroyed by the Allies in World War II.

By 1930 several US and European cities had built dual-carriageway highways, mostly to control traffic jams and/or to provide bypass routes for traffic.

In 1932 the first German &quot;autobahn&quot; opened between Cologne and Bonn. It ran and became a precedent for future highways. Although it, like the first &quot;autostrada&quot;, did not feature a dual-carriageway design, it inspired the mass construction of future high-speed roadways.

During the 1930s, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union began construction of a network of dual carriageway expressways. By 1942, Germany had over of dual carriageway roads, Italy had nearly , and the Soviet Union had .

What may have been the world&#x27;s first long-distance intercity dual carriageway/freeway was the Queen Elizabeth Way in Southern Ontario in Canada, initially linking the large cities of Toronto and Hamilton together by 1939, with construction on this stretch of the present-day Queen Elizabeth Way beginning in 1936 as &quot;Middle Road&quot;. It was gradually upgraded to a freeway from the 1950s to 1970s.

Opened to traffic in 1940, the Pennsylvania Turnpike was the first rural dual carriageway built in the United States. By 1955 several states had built dual carriageway freeways and turnpikes and in 1957 the Interstate Highway System began. Completed in 1994, the major highway system links all the major cities of the United States.

==European implementations==
===United Kingdom===
In the UK, although the term &quot;dual carriageway&quot; applies to any road with physically separated lanes, it is frequently used as a descriptive term for major routes built in this style. Such major dual carriageways usually have two lanes of traffic in each direction, with the lane nearest the centre being reserved for overtaking. Occasionally dual carriageways have only one lane in each direction, or more than two lanes each way (sometimes to permit easier overtaking of slower uphill traffic). Different speed limits apply on dual carriageway sections from those that apply on single carriageway sections of the same class of road, except in cities and built-up areas where the dual carriageway is more of a safety measure.
When first constructed, many dual carriageways—including the first motorways—had no crash- or other barriers in the central reservation. In the event of congestion, or if a driver missed their exit, some drivers made U-turns onto the opposite carriageway; many accidents were caused as a result of their misjudging the speed of approaching traffic on the other carriageway when doing so.

The majority of dual carriageway roads now have barriers. Some are heavy concrete obstructions which can bounce a vehicle back into the path of other traffic; others are made from steel ropes mounted on moderately weak posts, where the rope cuts into the vehicle body to slow the vehicle while keeping it against the barrier until it has stopped. Often on urban dual carriageways where the road has been converted from a four-lane single carriageway the central reservation will not be substantial: often just a small steel divider to save space.

Turning right (that is, across the line of traffic heading in the opposite direction) is usually permitted only at specific locations. Often the driver will be required to turn left (away from the dual carriageway) in order to loop around to an access road that permits crossing the major road. Roundabouts on dual carriageways are relatively common, especially in cities or where the cost of a grade-separated junction would be prohibitive. Where space is even more limited, intersections may be controlled by traffic lights. Smaller residential roads adjoining urban dual carriageways may be blocked off at one end to limit the number of junctions on the dual carriageway; often other roads will pass over or under the dual carriageway without an intersection.

A dual carriageway with grade-separated junctions and which meets other requirements may be upgraded to motorway standard, denoted by an &quot;(M)&quot; added after the road number (e.g. &quot;A1(M)&quot; or &quot;A38(M)&quot;). Unlike in Ireland, there was no official terminology for &#x27;high-quality dual carriageways&#x27; until April 2015, when in England a new standard was set to designate certain high-quality routes formally as &quot;Expressways&quot;. Many roads such as the A1, the A14, the A19 and the A42 are built to a high quality, with grade-separated junctions, full barriers at roadside and central reservations and, in some cases, three lanes of traffic. They may still fall short of motorway standard in terms of hard shoulders, the height of overpasses or the quality of intersecting junctions.

====Speed limits====
The national speed limit applies on dual carriageways (unless it is in a &#x27;built-up area&#x27;, or a lower limit is posted), which is as follows:

A dual carriageway in a built up area will have a statutory speed limit of unless otherwise sign-posted. It is common for such urban dual carriageways to have an increased speed limit of . A road deemed to be in a built up area is indicated by the presence of street lights; on lit dual carriageways that are not considered to be in a built-up area, the speed limit will be clarified with intermittent signs.

===Ireland===
Although in Ireland the term dual carriageway technically applies to any road with physically separated lanes, it is usually used only to refer to those route sections that do not have a motorway designation. Most often it is &quot;national roads&quot; (roads with a route number prefix of &quot;N&quot;; e.g. N8) that are built as or upgraded to dual carriageway. A number of non-national roads (for example, &quot;regional roads&quot;) are dual carriageway, for example in urban areas near or in cities, or where the road was part of a national route.

Dual carriageways of this class differ from motorways in a number of ways. The hard shoulder is demarcated with a dashed yellow line (as opposed to an unbroken yellow line on motorways). The standard speed limit of for national routes usually applies (by default the limit is for non-national roads, even if dual carriageway). Local authorities have the power to apply a limit of up to as used on most motorways (The High Quality Dual Carriageway section of the N1 between the end of the M1 and the border with Northern Ireland and the N25/N22 Ballincollig Bypass in Cork are the only route sections with such special limits).

Traffic lights and junctions are permitted at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this has resulted in fewer flyover junctions. Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due to the need to preserve access to adjoining property or to the absence of a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified do not need to be equipped with emergency phones.

Motorway restrictions only apply to motorway sections, rather than all dual carriageway sections of national roads (these are signposted with the &quot;N&quot; prefix on the route number, rather than &quot;M&quot;). Some &quot;national secondary roads&quot;, and &quot;regional roads&quot; in particular often have houses, schools and other developments fronting on to them. Less important &quot;national primary roads&quot;, and older sections not yet upgraded may also feature such developments built before the introduction the Irish Planning system in 1964. Today Irish planning policy prohibits such development on National Primary or National Secondary roads where the speed limit exceeds .

This policy results from concerns expressed by the National Roads Authority. A local authority is not obliged to implement this policy and can disregard this policy at its own discretion. This would usually only occur in exceptional circumstances or where planners are overruled by elected councillors using section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001. Accordingly, hard shoulders are included wherever feasible to provide for the resulting pedestrian and cyclist traffic, and are present on much of the national route network. These hard shoulders may also be used as running lanes by motorised traffic under certain conditions.

Until 2005, many motorways and dual carriageways in Ireland did not have crash barriers in the central reservation, the policy being to use a wider median instead. Crash barriers are now mandatory for such routes, and wire cabling or full crash barriers (depending on whether or not the route is a motorway, and median width) have been fitted to existing routes.

Between 2000 and 2010, three major types of dual carriageway were built on national road schemes in Ireland:

* High Quality Dual Carriageways (HQDC) – these were built mainly on the major inter-urban routes, to full motorway standard but without motorway regulations. The Roads Act, 2007 allows for these roads to be redesignated as motorways by ministerial order. Many of the sections of HQDC on the major inter-urban routes have been redesignated as motorways and full motorway regulations were applied when the redesignations came into effect.
* Standard dual carriageway of the traditional type was mainly used for schemes on the N11 road, the N18 road and the N25 road. Plans for this type of dual carriageway on the N20 road have been superseded by newer plans to build a motorway, the M20, to replace most of this route. Traditionally this type of dual-carriageway had a mixture of at grade junctions (including roundabouts), grade separated junctions, and median crossings. Nowadays they are similar to HQDCs, but minor at grade exits—generally left turn only—are allowed and the design speed (by Irish standards) is only 100 km/h. Median crossings and roundabouts are no longer generally found on these schemes. An example of a standard dual carriageway scheme, opened in 2006, is the Ennis bypass although this road has grade separated junctions and no median crossings. This route was upgraded to motorway status in 2009.
* 2+2 roads—officially these roads are designated as &quot;Type 2&quot; dual carriageways by the National Roads Authority (NRA). They were created by widening existing roads or building new roads, and have two lanes in each direction with a steel cable barrier in the middle but no hard shoulder. Most junctions are at-grade. With the exception of the restricted median width and the lack of lay-bys, this type of dual carriageway is similar to many dual carriageways found in the UK. The first 2+2 scheme was the N4 Dromod Roosky bypass, opened on 7 December 2007.
* 2+1 roads—officially these roads are designated as &quot;Type 3&quot; dual carriageways by the NRA. They have two lanes in one direction and one lane in the other, alternating every few kilometres, and usually separated with a steel cable barrier. Sections of 2+1 road were built on the N20 and the N2. In July 2007, the NRA announced that it would no longer build 2+1 roads and 2+2 roads were built instead.

===Germany===

In Germany the term &quot;Autobahnähnliche Straße&quot; (motorway-like road) refers to roads that are similar to German autobahn in grade-separation and signage. Most of them are designated as &quot;Kraftfahrstraßen&quot; (expressways), which means that the roads allow higher speed traffic than is common on other roads. This in turn requires them to have dual carriageways in most cases. An exception is the 2+1 road system in some rural areas; these roads are also referred to as expressways.

&quot;Autobahnähnliche Straßen&quot; mostly are colloquially referred to as &quot;gelbe Autobahn&quot; (yellow motorway) because they have the same technical standard as the &quot;Autobahn&quot; but have black on yellow signs instead of the white on blue signs used on the &quot;Autobahn&quot; motorway network. These are generally high-speed arterial roads in larger cities or important roads within a federal state that do not connect to major cities, so that they do not fall under the federal budget for the &quot;Autobahn&quot; network. The federal road Bundesstraße 27 is an example where about half of its length is upgraded to a high speed motorway standard. On the basis of their structure these roads have, comparable to the German &quot;autobahn&quot;, the legal foundation that no default speed limit exists (design speed 130 km/h), although the standard advisory speed limit () still exists. Nevertheless, expressways are often given speed limit signs.

 &quot;Exit signs.&quot;

At the moment some (blue) motorways have been taken out of the &quot;Autobahn&quot; network programme but still have the blue signs (e. g. the B 59, formerly A 540 near Grevenbroich); and on the other hand some former non-&quot;Autobahn&quot; (yellow) motorways have been added to &quot;Autobahn&quot; budgeting but the signs have not been changed either (e. g. parts of the B 6, now A 36 in the north of the Harz highland area in Saxony-Anhalt). Motorways that are neither in the &quot;autobahn&quot; network nor in the &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; network are given black on white signs, following the same sign code as high-speed dual carriageways—this is mostly seen on urban trunk roads.

===Italy===


Roads in Italy are an important mode of transport in Italy. Italian Highway Code (&quot;Codice della strada&quot;) divides dual carriageways into three different classifications:
* &quot;strada extraurbana principale&quot; (meaning &quot;main highway&quot;) or &quot;type-B road&quot;: a road with separate carriageways, at least two lanes for each direction, paved shoulder on the right and no cross-traffic. This type of road is quite similar to an &quot;autostrada&quot; or &quot;type-A road&quot; (Italian official name for motorways or freeways), but its building standards are lower. Access limitations and drive behaviour on type-B roads are the same as the motorways (no pedestrians, bicycles and other slow vehicles), as well as the signage (except for the background color, that is blue instead of green). Speed limits on type-B roads are up to . Type-B roads are always toll-free.
* &quot;strada extraurbana secondaria&quot; (meaning &quot;secondary road&quot;) or &quot;type-C road&quot;. This category contains all the roads in non-urban context that are neither &quot;autostrada&quot; (type A) nor &quot;strada extraurbana principale&quot; (type B). This means that a dual carriageway that may not be classified as type-B road, since it does not meet such quality standards, belongs to this category. For type-C roads, there are neither special signage nor access restrictions, unless a specific sign is placed. The speed limit is , on both single and dual carriageways.
* &quot;strada urbana di scorrimento&quot; (meaning &quot;urban expressway&quot;) or &quot;type-D road&quot;: a road in urban context, with separate carriageways, and at least two lanes for each direction. At-level junctions with smaller roads, regulated by traffic lights, are allowed as well as roundabouts. Unless a prohibition sign is placed, there are not access restrictions. Speed limits on this type of road are up to .

Italian type-B and type-C roads do not follow a specific numbering criterion. They may be numbered as Strade Statali (SS; &quot;state roads&quot;), Strade Regionali (SR; &quot;regional roads&quot;), Strade Provinciali (SP; &quot;provincial roads&quot;) or Strade Comunali (SC; &quot;municipal roads&quot;).

===Spain===
The Spanish word for dual carriageway is &quot;autovía&quot; (literally &quot;autoway&quot;). All of them are government-owned and not tolled.

First-generation autovías, built in the 1980s and early 1990s, were just duplications in parallel of existing roads, as shown in the photograph. Modern autovías are two carriageways built from scratch, leaving the old road they replace as an alternative route for pedestrians, bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles.

Private properties may have direct access to an autovía, as well as bus stops and gas stations in the hard shoulders. A controlled-access highway (motorway) in Spain is referred to as &quot;autopista&quot; (literally &quot;autotrack&quot;). They may be operated by private companies and be tolled. The two major accesses to Spain from France, AP-7 into Catalonia and AP-8 into the Basque Country, are autopistas. In comparison, the prime road between Spain and Portugal is the photographed autovía A-5. In both autopistas and autovías, the generic speed limit is , minimum speed is , driving backwards is strictly prohibited, and they shall not have at-grade junctions.

===Croatia===

Dual carriageways or expressways in Croatia () are non-tolled roads with 2 or more lanes in each direction, but without emergency lanes. The main motorways in Croatia are also dual carriageways, but they have emergency lanes and tolls.

Many bypasses and beltways of smaller cities in Croatia have been recently constructed or planned as dual carriageways. All dual carriageways in Croatia house a central median, usually fitted with guardrails.

The most heavily used expressways in Croatia is the D10 road, connecting capital Zagreb to Vrbovec and Križevci.

==Other regional implementations==

=== United States ===


In the United States, this type of road may be called a divided highway, boulevard, parkway, expressway, freeway, or interstate, and has a grassy median or Jersey barrier separating the traffic directions. With few exceptions, all roads in the federally funded Interstate Highway System are fully controlled access divided highways known as freeways. A broader definition, expressways, includes both freeways and partial limited-access divided highways, and &quot;expressway&quot; is often used specifically to refer to the latter.

United States Numbered Highways, state highways and other locally maintained highways may also be divided. Speed limits on rural divided highways range from , with some portions as high as . One privately run toll road in Texas, SH 130, has the highest speed limit in the United States at . Urban divided highways which are at grade and typically have much lower speed limits are sometimes called boulevards.

In keeping with the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD), since the early 1970s all divided highways are striped by color to show the direction of traffic flow. Two-way undivided roads have an amber center line, with a broken line indicating passing zones and a solid line indicating no passing zones and solid white baseline shoulder stripes.

On undivided roads with more than one lane in each direction, the center is normally marked with a double solid line. The double solid stripe denotes that it is illegal to pass on the other side of the center line. Multilane one-way carriageways use broken white lines between lanes; the median-side baseline is solid amber, and the right sideline is solid white.

Frequently in the U.S. the two carriageways are separated by some distance (wide medians with small forests or even hills in them), but drivers can always tell whether the roadway is two-way or one-way—and, if one-way, the direction in which the traffic flows—by looking at the striping coloration. For an example, see inset showing U.S. Route 52 near Lafayette, Indiana.

Some divided highways have been turned into undivided highways by widening the lanes of an existing road (for example US Highway 33 between Elkhart and Goshen in northern Indiana).

===Canada===

Like other countries, there are several types of divided highways; fully controlled-access divided routes with interchanges (commonly known as &quot;freeways&quot; in the United States, Australia, and regionally within Canada), expressways that often include a mix of interchanges and traffic signals, and divided arterial roads that are almost entirely stop-controlled. &quot;Unlike&quot; some other countries, divided dual carriageways in Canada are seldom equipped with traffic circles, roundabouts, or rotaries as alternatives to stoplights.

In Canada, the term &quot;divided highway&quot; is used for this type of road, and the segment between the roadways is referred to as a &quot;median&quot;. There may be gaps in the median strip of a partially controlled-access road to allow turning and crossing. More informally, a divided highway may be referred to as &quot;twinned&quot;. This stems from the practice of &quot;twinning&quot; an existing two-lane highway and converting it into a divided highway. Such highways in southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and parts of Atlantic Canada usually feature full controlled-access with interchanges where robust federal and provincial funding has made such freeways possible. However, due to a lack of funding elsewhere, partial controlled-access &quot;expressways&quot; and limited-mobility divided arterial roads are more common in the western provinces where there are no specially numbered systems of freeways.

On some portions of Ontario&#x27;s 400-series highway network, the median may be either steel guardrail or an Ontario tall-wall barrier rather than an unpaved strip, particularly in urban areas.

Some partial limited-access divided highways such as the Hanlon Parkway and Black Creek Drive have stop-controlled at-grade intersections and private entrances, but have sufficient right-of-way to convert them to full freeways with interchanges if traffic warrants. There are also RIRO expressways, such as Highway 11 and a portion of Highway 35, which are not full freeways since they allow access to existing properties, but traffic speeds are faster than regular roads due to a median barrier preventing left turns (motorists have to use a &quot;turnabout&quot; overpass to access exits on the opposing direction). Speed limits in Canada are usually 80 to 90 km/h on signalized divided highways and 100 to 120 km/h on freeways.

===Australia===
In Australia, dual carriageways are referred to in some regions as divided roads, though there is no official terminology.
Each state&#x27;s road agency has its own definition of what constitutes a &#x27;motorway/freeway&#x27; standard divided road. Most states only declare a divided road as a &#x27;motorway&#x27; or &#x27;freeway&#x27; if access is completely controlled. Speed limits are usually 100 km/h or 110 km/h.

VicRoads, the agency responsible for highways in the state of Victoria, has often declared rural limited-access dual carriageways as freeways. Furthermore, VicRoads applies the M designation to these roads in alpha-numeric route numbers, where most other states will only do so if access is completely controlled.

Dual carriageways exist in and around the major capital cities however there are currently several road projects under construction have now been completed, creating roughly 2,000 kilometres of continuous dual carriageway from Geelong in Victoria to Curra in South East Queensland except for one 14 kilometre section of the Pacific Highway through Coffs Harbour.

Since 2013, it has been possible to drive between Australia&#x27;s two largest cities (Sydney and Melbourne) on a continuous dual carriageway. When it was completed, the Hume Highway duplication became the first major interstate duplicated motorway.

===Brazil===

The country has about of divided highways, only in the State of São Paulo. Currently it&#x27;s possible to travel from Rio Grande, in the extreme south of the country, to Brasília () or Casimiro de Abreu, in the state of Rio de Janeiro (), only on divided highways.

The first highway to be transformed into a divided highway in Brazil was Rodovia Presidente Dutra, which is part of BR-116. In the stretch between the 2 largest cities in the country, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the highway was duplicated in 1967.

===Argentina===

Argentina has approximately 2,800 km of divided highways. It&#x27;s 50 km on the Ruta 1, which connects Buenos Aires to La Plata; 157 km on Ruta 3, between Buenos Aires/San Miguel del Monte and Puerto Madryn/Trelew; 485 km on the Ruta 7, which connects Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile; 700 km on Ruta 9, which connects Buenos Aires, Rosario and Córdoba; and 589 km on the Ruta 14, which connects Buenos Aires to Paso de los Libres, on the border with Brazil.

===Chile===
Chile&#x27;s main route is Route 5 (Pan-American Highway). From Puerto Montt to Caldera () it&#x27;s a divided highway. Chile doesn&#x27;t just expand the highway after the city of Caldera because in this part of the country, it enters the Atacama Desert, where there is low traffic of vehicles. The Route 68, () connecting Santiago to Valparaíso, is also a divided highway. In 2020, Chile had 3,347 km (2,080 mi) of duplicated highways, the second largest network in South America, after Brazil.

===China===
The best examples of dual carriageways in mainland China can be seen on the China National Highways. On some routes, such as China National Highway 106, there is a central reservation.

===Thailand===
Most Highways in Thailand are single carriageways with a hard shoulder. Dual carriageways have frequent u-turn lanes and intersections slowing down traffic. Coupled with the increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for a limited-access motorway, the Thai Government issued a Cabinet resolution in 1997 detailing the motorway construction master plan. Some upgraded sections of highway are being turned into a &quot;motorway&quot;, while other motorways are not being built from highway sections.
===Turkey===
Turkey has 28,986 km of dual carriageway as January 2023. Speed limit changes, but normally 110 km/h is the limit of state road (e.g. D 100). Turkey has 3,633 km of motorways. The minimum speed limit on the Turkish motorways is 40 km/h and the maximum is 140 km/h. Almost all of the network is 6 lanes (3 in each direction) wide and illuminated. Some parts converted from uncontrolled access dual carriageways are 4 lanes (2 in each direction) wide. The motorway sign in Turkey is green and uses Highway Gothic typeface. 
===India===

India has many dual carriageways. Many of them are under the control of National Highways Authority of India and some of them are under state and local authorities. National Highway (India) and State highways in India comes under these type of roads, like Golden Quadrilateral and major arterial roads.
===Pakistan===
Hyderabad–Mirpurkhas Dual Carriageway was constructed in 2012 on which the work started in 2009. It was under the Special Directives of President Asif Ali Zardari and Chief Minister Sindh Syed Qaim Ali Shah the first dual carriageway constructed under the Public Private Plan it extends up to 60 km.

N-55 and N-5 are dual carriageways.

===Philippines===
Principal Philippine Expressways, Metro Manila Roads and Avenues in Metro Cebu are examples of dual carriageways in the Philippines. STAR Tollway, NLEX, SCTEX and SLEX have portions with central reservations. Some highways inside Metro Manila have underpasses, tunnels and flyovers.

===Singapore===
A high proportion of roads in Singapore are dual carriageways with central reservations; examples include Clementi Road, Commonwealth Avenue and Holland Road. Often there might be railings erected on the central reservation to prevent pedestrians from dashing across the road. These usually have traffic lights along the way but flyovers and road tunnels (or &#x27;underpasses&#x27;) can be built to minimize the use of traffic lights; for example, at the Holland Road-Farrer Road-Queensway junction there are three levels of roads. Before the 1980s, roundabouts were popular, but since then many have been changed to traffic-light controlled junctions.

These dual carriageways are to be distinguished from motorways, known in Singapore as expressways such as the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) where no traffic lights are used.

===Malaysia===
Known dual carriageways in Malaysia include the North–South Expressway (the main motorway system in Peninsular Malaysia), the East Coast Expressway (serving the Peninsular east coast), the Federal Highway (serving Kuala Lumpur), the AMJ Highway (linking Malacca and the Johorean towns Muar and Batu Pahat) and the under construct Pan Borneo Highway of Sabah and Sarawak. Some highways inside Klang Valley have underpasses, tunnels and flyovers e.g. SMART Tunnel (mostly tunnel section) and Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (mostly elevated section). Apart from major motorways and expressways, treelined dual carriageways also pass through most urban areas.

<text>Soule (; Basque: Zuberoa; Zuberoan/ Soule Basque: Xiberoa or Xiberua; ) is a former viscounty and French province and part of the present-day Pyrénées-Atlantiques &quot;département&quot;. It is divided into two cantons of the arrondissement (district) of Oloron-Sainte-Marie (Mauleon-Licharre and Tardets-Sorholus), and a part of the canton of Saint Palais (arrondissement of Bayonne).

Its provincial capital is Mauléon, which combined with Licharre in 1841 to form &quot;Mauléon-Licharre&quot;, but today is often known as &quot;Mauléon-Soule&quot;. Historically, Soule is the smallest province of the Basque Country (785 km2; 303 sq. mi.). Its population has been decreasing (23,803 in 1901; 16,006 in 1990; 15,535 in 1999).

== Etymology ==

The territory is named &quot;Xiberoa&quot; in Souletin Basque, &quot;Zuberoa&quot; in standard Basque, &quot;Sola&quot; in Gascon and &quot;Soule&quot; in French; all of them derivate from &quot;Subola&quot;, the previous name of the region attested for the first time in the year 635 in the diaries of a Franco-Burgundian expedition led by Duke Arnebert against the Basques. &quot;Subola&quot; comes from the name the Romans gave to the Aquitani tribe that inhabited the region by the time of their arrival, the Suburates, also called &quot;Sibusates&quot; by Julius Caesar in his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot; and &quot;Sybillates&quot; by Pliny the Elder.

== History ==

Soule has been continuously inhabited since the last glaciation. There are several deposits from the Neolithic as well as fifteen protohistoric settlements. The first text written in Soule dates from the 7th century.

=== Ancient Soule ===

The territory was already inhabited in the Middle Paleolithic; Neanderthal prehistoric settlements have been found in the caves of Xaxixiloaga in Aussurucq and Etxeberri. At the end of the Neolithic the population had extended and assimilated knowledge from other peoples. There are protohistoric settlements that show a simple material life and a lifestyle dominated by migration. Remains of coins and other monetary artifacts have been found, proving the existence of an exchange economy in Soule, which very likely worked as an access point between Aquitaine—Novempopulania—in the north and the southern side of the Pyrenees.

At the time of the Roman arrival in the 1st century, Soule was inhabited by an Aquitani tribe named Suburates, who spoke the Aquitanian language (a form of Proto-Basque). As with other peoples in Aquitaine, the Romans had some influence in the territory, although Soule kept its language and culture and was relatively unimportant during the times of the Roman Empire, due to its isolation. The only evidence of Roman influence in Soule exists in the chapelle of the Madeleine, in Tardets.

Soule is first mentioned as a territory in a text from the 7th Century. In 636 (or 635) the Frankish army led by the Duke Arembert was ambushed and defeated by the Basques in a place named &quot;vallis subola&quot;. This valley is then included in the territory of the &quot;Wascones&quot; (Duchy of Vasconia), which included intermittently lands to either side of the western and central Pyrenees. It was later referred to as Gascony.

=== Middle Ages ===

The region of Soule may have developed a primeval political structure before the 11th century with a strong influence from the Kingdom of Pamplona, established in 824. However, it would be in 1023 when Sancho VI Duke of Gascony would name Guillaume Fort as first Viscount of Soule. His descendants would inherit the title for around two centuries. The Viscounts of Soule had their base in the fortress of Mauléon, a strategic region that controlled the pass from Aquitaine to the Iberian peninsula. The viscounts of Soule took advantage of their territory. Despite being small in size, it held a strategic position between the Kingdom of Navarre to the south and the Duchy of Aquitaine to the north.

In 1152, Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry II of England, and thus the Duchy of Aquitaine joined the Crown of England. In 1261, after ten years of conflict, the last viscount of Soule, Auger III, surrendered the castle of Mauléon to Edward I of England, and as a result the territory of Soule was administered by the crown of England. At this time the current network of roads between the Souletin villages was constructed.

==== Soule under English rule ====

The English Soule was under the direct authority of the Duke of Aquitaine, who was also the King of England. Control over the territory was delegated to a lord, who kept the castle of Mauléon and collected the taxes. The lord of Soule had fourteen captains, of whom only one was English, the rest being either locally-born or Gascons. The ex-viscount Auger III allied with the Kingdom of Navarre, and taking advantage of the war between Philip IV, king of Navarre, and Edward I of England, retook his fortress at Mauléon in 1295, but he was forced to hand it back after Aquitaine was formally declared English in 1303.

The Hundred Years&#x27; War kept Soule isolated from the exterior for many years. Finally, in 1449, an army led by Gaston IV, the Count of Foix and Viscount of Béarn, took possession of the castle in the name of the French king ending the English presence in Soule.

===Modern Period===

====Soule under French rule====

In the mid 15th century, Soule finally recognizes the King of France as its own, with the Basque district becoming the smallest province and exclave of the kingdom and the most distant from the centre of power, Paris. It came to be surrounded by the sovereign Kingdom of Navarre on the south and west and the independent principality of Viscounty of Béarn on the east. In 1511, King Francis I of France urged the Souletins to set down their institutional and legal framework on paper, which they did in Bearnese, the administrative written language up to that point. In 1539, an amendment to their region specific laws went on to be written in French, the new official language as decreed by King Francis I. Despite numbering more than fifty towns and villages, Soule was populated by fewer than 4,000 people. The only town was Mauléon, with a population totalling fewer than 350 people. As of 1512, given its proximity to France and its particular geographic situation surrounded by the Kingdom of Navarre-Bearn and the recently invaded Navarre to the south, Soule became ensnared in the political, religious and military manoeuvres derived from its shaky position, with the French Wars of Religion affecting the province tremendously.

====The end of home rule====
The province of Soule relied largely on the commons set on the highlands and lowlands of the valley for the use of local farmers and shepherds. However, they were also coveted by local and alien lords with estate grants on Soule. By the mid 17th century and in the context of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, anger spread like fire among common Souletins at the aristocracy&#x27;s takeover of lands and the curtailment of their legal and institutional sovereignty. In 1661, a widespread rebellion erupted led by the priest Bernard Goihenetche &#x27;Matalaz&#x27;, but was harshly suppressed by an army sent over from Gascony.

Still Soule managed to retain many native laws and institutions, with its representatives attending the Parliament of Navarre and Béarn (six deputies, two for each estate). The representatives of Soule in the National Costituent Assembly held in Paris (August 1789) voted against the suppression of the French provinces and the establishment of a new administrative arrangement that wiped out the existence of their native order, giving way to the &quot;départément&quot; system.

Attempts by the Basque deputies in Paris to create a Basque department failed, their districts merged with Béarn among protests of the Basque representatives, and even Soule was divided into two cantons. After the end of the First Carlist War in Spain and the relocation of customs to the Pyrenees from the Ebro (1841), trade with Navarre collapsed. In the late 19th century, the establishment of espadrille factories in Mauleón made up for the decay of economic life and emigration, with a number of inhabitants in Navarre and Aragón pouring in and being recruited on the workforce.

== Geography ==

Soule is located in the northern basin of the western Pyrenees, and is the smallest of the Basque region. It is surrounded by Lower Navarre on the west, Navarre on the south, Béarn on the east and north. Along with Labourd and Lower Navarre, it forms the Northern Basque Country, also known as French Basque Country or &quot;Pays basque&quot;. Its entire territory extends around the axis provided by the river Saison, known in Basque as Uhaitza, that flows from south to north until it joins the river Oloron, that works as a border between Soule and Béarn.

Soule includes three geographical regions: the lowlands at north on a territory known as &quot;Pettara&quot; or Lower Soule, a forest region known as &quot;Arbaila&quot; and the highlands at south, in a region named &quot;Basabürüa&quot; with a highest peak at at the Pic d&#x27;Orhy.

=== Orography ===

Soule&#x27;s orography divides into three regions: the northern lowlands, made up by extensive plains; the central region, which is fairly hilly and the southern highlands, which are part of the northwestern Pyrenees, with altitudes reaching up to above sea level at the Pic d&#x27;Orhy.

In the Pyrenees, from west to east, the first peak is the Pic d&#x27;Orhy, above and the fourth highest peak in the Basque Country after Iror Errege Maia and Euzkarre among others, all of them in Navarre. Also in the highlands are located the Otsogorrigaina ( and Sardekagaina (, which are the second and third highest mountains in Soule. In total, there exist more than 20 peaks higher than .

=== Hydrography ===

The river Saison (known as Ühaitza in Souletin Basque) is the main river of Soule. It is long and originates at Licq, in the highlands region. Smaller rivers rising at the Pyrenees join the Saison before it converges with the river Oloron, together flowing into the river Adour.

=== Climate ===

The oceanic climate of Soule is generally warm and humid. The highlands and Pyrenees experience an alpine climate.

== Demography ==

Soule is the province with the lowest population density of the Northern Basque Country, with . Soule has experienced a significant population decline since the 19th century; many people have emigrated to larger cities and regions outside the province, such as Labourd, Béarn and Paris. In the last century, Soule has lost more than three quarters of its population, which has caused the need for different municipalities to be merged in order to assure the maintenance of public services.

== Administrative divisions ==

Traditionally, Soule has been divided into three geographical regions, each of which group a determinate number of municipalities or communes.

*Pettarra, comprising the lower Soule, in the north. It includes the towns and villages of Ainharp, Aroue-Ithorots-Olhaïby, Berrogain-Laruns, Domezain-Berraute, Espès-Undurein, Etcharry, Gestas, L&#x27;Hôpital-Saint-Blaise, Lohitzun-Oyhercq, Mauléon-Licharre, Moncayolle-Larrory-Mendibieu, Osserain-Rivareyte, Viodos-Abense-de-Bas.
*Arbaila, in the mid-lands. It is divided into two regions: &quot;Arbaila Txipia&quot; (&quot;small Arbaila&quot;) and &quot;Arbaila Handia&quot; (&quot;big Arbaila&quot;). It includes the towns and villages of Aussurucq, Garindein, Gotein-Libarrenx, Idaux-Mendy, Menditte, Musculdy, Ordiarp, Ossas-Suhare, Pagolle, Roquiague, Sauguis-Saint-Étienne.
*Basabürua, comprising the highlands and Pyrenees. It is divided into two regions: &quot;Ibarresküin&quot; (&quot;the right valley&quot;) and &quot;Ibarrezker&quot; (&quot;the left valley&quot;). It includes the towns and villages of Alçay-Alçabéhéty-Sunharette, Alos-Sibas-Abense, Barcus, Camou-Cihigue, Esquiule, Etchebar, Haux, Lacarry-Arhan-Charritte-de-Haut, Laguinge-Restoue, Larrau, Lichans-Sunhar, Licq-Athérey, Montory, Sainte-Engrâce, Tardets-Sorholus, Trois-Villes.

For administrative purposes, the communes of Soule are grouped into four cantons; the canton of Mauléon-Licharre, that includes 19 communes; the canton of Tardets-Sorholus, that includes 16 communes; the canton of Saint-Palais and the canton of Oloron.

==Culture==

After decades of emigration and demographic, social and cultural decay, the territory is showing a strong determination to recover the lost vitality of centuries ago. Assorted cultural events linked to old traditions bear witness to that dynamism.
There is a tradition of folk musical theatre, the &quot;pastoral&quot;: the inhabitants of a village spend the year preparing and rehearsing the play and its dances. Traditionally, the subject of the play was Catholic, but recently pieces of Basque history are also presented. Another event akin to the pastoral beloved of the people of Soule is the &quot;maskaradas&quot;. This theatrical performances are put on in many villages of Soule in carnival time through spring. Each year a specific village takes the responsibility of arranging a new performance. It consists of a music band in due carnival outfit surrounded with a group of set carnivalesque characters and dancers parading up and down the main street of the host village; at the end, they stage an informal play usually in the market place or handball court.

Soule is also renowned for its singing tradition, elegant dances and local music instruments, such as &quot;xirula&quot; and &quot;ttun-ttun&quot;. These instruments are gaining new dynamism thanks to music schools founded to that end by local cultural activists.

===Language===

Soule&#x27;s own language has been Basque for centuries, with the region featuring its own Souletin dialect. At the same time, the neighbouring Béarnais (Gascon) has been widely understood, and in recent centuries even spoken as a lingua franca. However, both Basque and Béarnais have lost ground to French with both languages struggling to survive into the next generation. Basque is attested to have been widespread farther east of the territory into the Pyrenees in previous centuries.

The inhabitants call non-Basque speaking foreigners &quot;Kaskoinak&quot;, while other Basque speaking people (especially when referring to those of the French Basque Country) are dubbed &quot;Manexak&quot; after a commonplace sheep breed in the area.

<text>Metrocentre is a shopping centre and entertainment complex in the Dunston area of Gateshead. It is located on the former site of Dunston Power Station, near to the River Tyne.

Metrocentre opened in stages, with the first phase opening on 28 April 1986, and the official opening being held on 14 October that year. It has 206 shops, 38 restaurants, an Odeon cinema, a Clip n’ Climb, a bingo alley, a Namco Funscape, The Escapologist and Treetop Golf, occupying over of retail floor space, making it the second-largest shopping centre in the UK, behind Westfield London. Additional retail space can be found in the adjoining Metro Retail Park and MetrOasis.

==History==

Metrocentre&#x27;s construction was financed by the Church Commissioners of England, and was masterminded by Sir John Hall&#x27;s company, Cameron Hall Developments. The ground upon which it is built was purchased for £100,000 in the early 1970s. Access to the development was facilitated by an urban development grant from the Department of the Environment, and the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.

In early 1984, the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead helped to host an exhibition at a local hotel to draw attention to the proposed scheme. To the surprise of all involved, over 1,000 visitors, including the top retailers in the UK, Marks &amp; Spencer, Burton, Boots, Sears, BHS, House of Fraser and Littlewoods came to the North East to view the exhibition and express their interest in the development. Suddenly, the Metrocentre became “flavor of the month” in retailing.

The first phase of the development, the Red Mall, was opened in April 1986. At the time, it featured a large Carrefour supermarket, which later became a Gateway, and subsequently Asda. Metrocentre also featured the first out-of-town branch of Marks &amp; Spencer. The Green Mall opened as part of Phase 2 on 14 October, with the Blue and Yellow Malls following in Phase 3 in 1987. A UCI cinema also opened in Phase 3.

In August 1987 the MetroCentre railway station, which is connected to the centre via a covered footbridge, was opened by British Rail.

1988 saw Metroland and the Yellow Mall open to the public. A Roman Forum-themed area also opened, and by 1989, a Mediterranean Village-themed area, a GX Superbowl bowling alley, a 350 bay Coach Park and the entire mall opened.

=== 1990s–2000s ===

By 1990, Phase 4 and the A1 Western Bypass opened, and by 1991, the Westren Bypass 3rd lane opened inbound from the A1 South. With 1992 rolling in, the north perimeter link to A1 North and West opened, and in 1994, a new road called Handy Drive opened.

In October 1995, the centre was sold to Capital Shopping Centres (later intu Properties) for £364 million, although the Church Commissioners retained a 10% stake.

In 1997, Asda moved from Metrocentre to a larger stand-alone store nearby, facilitating the redevelopment of the Red Mall, with the former Asda store being demolished in 2002, with the new Debenhams department store open by October 2004. The refurbishment programme at the time also included the construction of a new Transport Interchange, sited at the edge of the Blue Mall, replacing the former bus station.

In November 2006, centre owner Capital Shopping Centres announced plans to redevelop the centre&#x27;s Yellow Mall. The Metroland indoor funfair closed in April 2008, and the area, along with the neighbouring Clockworks Food Court, has since been refurbished to become Metrocentre Qube.

Until August 2007, when it was purchased for £82.5 million, the adjacent retail park was not under the same ownership as the shopping centre.

In 2008, plans were announced for the £35 million redevelopment to the Yellow Mall into a new dining and leisure area. With this, The New Metroland and Megabowl were closed for the accommodation for the new scheme, and by May 2009, the Qube opened, with restaurants like Nando’s, Frankie &amp; Benny’s, Yo! Sushi, The Red House and PizzaExpress. With that, the first three specially commissioned art projects were installed in the Upper Qube. The first one to be installed was “This and That” by Colin Rose. It is an impressive sculpture made up of two giant steel cones.

The second art project was installed in the Lower Qube. The small piece, named “Outside In” by local artist Stephen Newby is made up of four blown stainless steel cubes. In November 2009, a Namco Funscape amusement centre opened in the Lower Qube, with 18 ten-pin bowling lanes, the fastest Dodgem Track in Europe, a children’s soft play area and more. With that, it caused Odeon to move from the Lower Blue Mall to the Upper Qube in December 2009.

=== 2010s–2020s ===
Autumn 2010 saw a mixed TK Maxx and Homesense store open on the site of the former cinema in the Lower Blue Mall. In November 2011, construction started on the new MetrOasis, on the site of a former Esso garage. In 2012, the Central Mall was redeveloped as the Platinum Mall, which focuses on higher-end stores and designer outlets. Initial stores in the Platinum Mall included Mamas &amp; Papas, H&amp;M Kids and Tessuti.

The centre was rebranded as intu Metrocentre in 2013, following the renaming of its parent Capital Shopping Centres Group as intu Properties. With that, the old federation brewery site was demolished in 2013.

In March 2018, a 78,000 sq ft Next store opened, taking twelve shops on the upper floor, and the former BHS unit on the lower level, to create one of the largest Next stores in the country. Next further expanded their presence in the centre in 2020 by opening a Beauty &amp; Home store in the former Debenhams anchor unit.

On 26 October 2020, it was announced that Sovereign Centros was to oversee asset management of the centre on behalf of owners Metrocentre Partnership, following the collapse of intu. The shopping centre was again rebranded, as The Metrocentre, with Savills as on-site property managers. Owners, the Metrocentre Partnership includes Church Commissioners and GIC Real Estate.

==Malls and retailers==
The Metrocentre has five malls: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Platinum.

Many large retail chains are represented in the centre. It is anchored by a number of large stores and department stores:
*Marks &amp; Spencer (Green Mall)
*Next (Green Mall) 
*Harrods Beauty (Town Square) (Formerly House of Fraser)
*Primark (Exhibition Square)
*TK Maxx (Blue Mall)
*Sports Direct (Red Mall) (Formerly Debenhams)
*JD

Major fashion retailers include: All Saints, H&amp;M, New Look, Next, Primark, River Island and Zara.

Other major retailers include: Boots, Hotel Chocolat, Poundland, WH Smith, Ann Summers, Lush, Waterstones, Lego, and Apple.

==Leisure facilities==

The centre&#x27;s leisure facilities, which are mainly located in the Qube / Yellow Mall, consist of an Odeon cinema and Namco Funscape, Clip &amp; Climb, Treetop Golf and Escapologist Escape Rooms. 

The Odeon, a 12 screen cinema, opened in 2010. It features a VIP lounge, as well as multiple 3D screens, and an IMAX Digital – the first in the north-east of England.

Namco Funscape is located on the lower floor, and is a family entertainment centre including an 18-lane ten-pin bowling alley, dodgem ride and soft play. 

Treetop Golf, which opened in upper Qube in late 2023, features two 18 hole mini golf courses. Clip &amp; Climb in lower Qube is home to 26 climbing walls and a 10m drop slide. It replaced the old Angry Birds Adventure Golf space when it closed on 19 February 2023.

In November 2023 Everlast Gyms opened the UK&#x27;s largest hybrid gym on what was the top floor of the former Debenhams department store. The 40,000 sq ft gym includes a full size boxing ring, spin studio, yoga room, saunas and ice baths.

The Qube&#x27;s exterior is clad with zinc and glass, to distinguish it as the entertainment part of the centre.

Qube is also home to a number of restaurants, including Bella Italia, Nando&#x27;s, Pizza Express, YO! Sushi and Zizzi.

===Metroland===
The centre also featured an entirely enclosed theme park called Metroland. Renamed &quot;The New Metroland&quot; following refurbishment works by operators Arlington Leisure in 1996, it was Europe&#x27;s largest indoor amusement park until its closure in 2008. Metroland opened in February 1988 at the cost of £20 million. The park&#x27;s main rides included a rollercoaster, Ferris wheel, pirate ship, waltzers, a miniature railway and dodgem cars.

On the final weekend before its closure (19–20 April 2008), the park held the &#x27;Last Ride Weekend&#x27;, where the admission price was £5 for the whole day, with unlimited access to all the rides. The park finally closed at 8:00 pm on 20 April 2008, despite strong local opposition, and petitions raising around 4,000 signatures. Proceeds from the last night of operation went to charity.

After the closure, many of the park&#x27;s rides were either scrapped or sold off, with the rollercoaster being relocated to The Big Sheep, a farm and theme park complex in Devon, where it reopened in March 2016. The park offered a free ride to visitors from the North-East of England for a period after the rollercoaster&#x27;s reopening.

==Metro Retail Park==
Metro Retail Park occupies over 183,000 sq ft of space and is home to 15 brands, the majority of which are home and lifestyle brands. Situated to the west of Metrocentre it has the layout of a conventional out-of-town retail park, with large stores such as Barker and Stonehouse, Oak Furniture Land and Furniture Village.

The former Toys R Us unit was demolished in November 2022 to make way for a £5m redevelopment to bring in three new units, occupying over 25,000 sq ft of space. Work also included the introduction of 6 rapid EV charging units and increased cycle bay provision.

==metrOasis==
The metrOasis retail area, on the perimeter of the shopping centre, opened to the public in September 2012. It is located between Qube and the Metro Retail Park, on the site of a former petrol station. The development is home to a range of dining and entertainment venues, with construction beginning in January 2012. The retail area includes drive-thru Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Starbucks, as well as a Toby Carvery and Burger King.

== Transport ==
Metrocentre has a large bus station and the MetroCentre railway station is connected to the centre via a covered footbridge. The centre&#x27;s car parking facilities has approximately 10,000 spaces.

<text>Labourd (; ; ; ) is a former French province and part of the present-day Pyrénées Atlantiques &quot;département&quot; of Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. It is one of the traditional Basque provinces, and identified as one of the territorial component parts of the Basque Country by many, especially by the Basque nationalists.

Labourd extends from the Pyrenees to the river Adour, along the Bay of Biscay. To the south are Gipuzkoa and Navarre in Spain, to the east is Lower Navarre, and to the north are the Landes. It has an area of almost and a population of over 200,000 (115,154 in 1901; 209,913 in 1990), making it the most populous of the three French Basque provinces. Over 25% of the inhabitants speak Basque (17% in the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz zone, 43% in the rest). Labourd has also long had a Gascon-speaking tradition, notably along the banks of the river Adour but also more diffusely throughout the whole viscounty (about 20% in Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz).

The main town of Labourd is Bayonne, although the capital up to the French Revolution was Ustaritz, 13 km away, where local Basque leaders assembled. Other important towns are Biarritz, Anglet (between Bayonne and Biarritz), Hendaye, Ciboure and Saint-Jean-de-Luz along the coast, and Hasparren inland. The area is famous for the five-day &quot;Fêtes de Bayonne&quot; and the red peppers of Espelette. Many tourists come to the coast, especially to Biarritz, and to the hills and mountains of the interior for walking and agri-tourism. La Rhune (&quot;Larrun&quot; in Basque), a 900 m high mountain, lies south of Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the border with Spain.

The traditional buildings of Labourd have low-roofed, half-timbered features, stone lintels, and red, white and green paint. The house of Edmond Rostand, Villa Arnaga at Cambo-les-Bains, is such a house and is now a museum dedicated to the author of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and to Basque traditions.

Lapurdian (&quot;Lapurtera&quot;) is a dialect of the Basque language spoken in the region.

==History==
Ancient Labourd was inhabited by the Tarbelli, an Aquitanian tribe. They had the fortified town of &quot;Lapurdum&quot;, which eventually would become modern Bayonne and give its name to the region.

In the Middle Ages, it formed part of the Duchy of Vasconia, which eventually came to be called Gascony.

After the early 9th century, the area of the river Adour was referred to as the County of Vasconia. According to many authorities, Duke Sancho VI of Gascony ceded Labourd and its ports, Bayonne and Biarritz, to King Sancho III of Navarre around 1023, and Sancho in turn bestowed it on his majordomo, Lope Sánchez, as viscount. This Lope was supposedly the king&#x27;s relative, being a nephew of King Ramiro Garcés of Viguera. This oft-repeated story has no basis in contemporary documents, and there is no evidence that Navarre extended its territory north of the Pyrenees prior to the late 12th century.

Around 1125, Bayonne was chartered by Duke William IX of Aquitaine. In 1130–31, King Alfonso the Battler of Aragon and Navarre attacked Bayonne over a dispute on jurisdictions with the Duke of Aquitaine, William X the Saint.

Labourd was ruled directly, between 1169 and 1199, by Richard Lionheart, who gave a second charter to Bayonne c. 1174 and, c. 1175, returning to the merchants of this city the duties they paid in the tolls of Poitou, Aquitaine and Gascony. This caused an uprising of Gascons and Basques (including Labourdins from outside Bayonne), but Richard defeated all the cities that had revolted.

Richard married the Navarrese princess Berengaria of Navarre in 1191, which favored the trade between Navarre and Bayonne (and England). This marriage also included a jurisdictional transaction that shaped the borders of the Northern Basque Country: Lower Navarre was definitively annexed to Navarre, while Labourd and Soule remained as parts of Angevin Aquitaine. This pact was materialized in 1193 in form of the sale of their rights by the legitimate viscounts of Labourd, who had established their seat in Ustaritz. From that point, Ustaritz was the capital of Labourd, instead of Bayonne, until the suppression of the province in 1790.

John I of England, gave to Bayonne the Municipal Law, that created the figures of mayor, 12 jurors, 12 councilors and 75 advisors.

Labourd passed to French hands in 1451, just before the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Since then and until the French Revolution, Labourd was largely self-ruled as an autonomous French province.

In 1610, Labourd suffered a major witch-hunt at the hands of the judge Pierre de Lancre after feuds between the elites (merchant bourgeoisie vs nobility) and different social layers (nobility vs common people) took a turn for the worse over elements of superstition and alleged public morality, which ended up with some 70 supposed &quot;sorginak&quot; burnt at the stake (see Basque witch trials).

In 1790, France suppressed the historical provinces, including Labourd, incorporating them into the newly created département of Basses-Pyrénées, together with Béarn. Dominique Joseph Garat and his older brother were then representing the Biltzar (Assembly) of Labourd&#x27;s third estate in Paris. Like the other Basque representatives, he opposed the new administrative layout (but eventually voted for it) and the inclusion of the Basques in the same department with Bayonne and Béarn.

During the War of the Pyrenees, Labourd had its customary trade with the Southern Basque Country interrupted, and was shaken by indiscriminate repression unleashed by the Convention (1793-1794) resulting in mass deportation to the Landes of Gascony, seizure of landholdings, and the death of an estimated 1,600 civilians from the bordering towns of Sara, Itxassou, Ascain, Biriatu, etc. The abuses included the establishment of new, alien names to the villages and towns of Labourd, but they were soon after reverted to their usual names.

In the last decades, petitions have asked for the separation from Béarn and the creation of a Basque département, together with the other two historical Basque provinces of Lower Navarre and Soule.

===Mariner activities===
Labourd, like the other coastal territories of the Basque Country, played an important role in early European exploitation of the Atlantic Ocean.

The earliest document (a bill) that mentions the whale oil or blubber dates from 670. In 1059, Labourdin whalers already gave to the viscount the oil of the first captured animal. It seems that Basques disliked the taste of whales but made good business selling their meat and oil to the French, Castilian and Flemish. Basque whalers used for this activity the longboats known as traineras, that only allowed whaling near the coast or based in a larger ship.

It seems that it was this industry, along with cod-fishing, is what brought Basque sailors to the North Sea and eventually to Newfoundland. Basque whaling in Newfoundland and Labrador began in the 1530s. By at least the early 17th century Basque whalers had reached Iceland.

The development of the rudder in Europe seems also a Basque and specifically Labourdine development. Three masted ships appear in a fresco of Estella (Navarre), dating to the 12th century, seals preserved in the Navarrese and Parisian historical archives also show similar ships. The rudder itself is first mentioned as steer &quot;a la Navarraise&quot; or &quot;a la Bayonaise&quot;.

After Navarre lost San Sebastian and Hondarribia to Castile in 1200, it signed a treaty with Bayonne that made it the &quot;port of Navarre&quot; for nearly three centuries, a role that extended also into the Early Modern Age, after Navarre had been annexed by Castile (but both provinces remained autonomous).

<text>CMS Pipelines is a feature of the VM/CMS operating system that allows the user to create and use a pipeline. The programs in a pipeline operate on a sequential stream of records. A program writes records that are read by the next program in the pipeline. Any program can be combined with any other because reading and writing is done through a device independent interface.

==Overview==
&quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; provides a CMS command, codice_1. The argument string to the codice_1 command is the pipeline specification. PIPE selects programs to run and chains them together in a pipeline to pump data through.

Because CMS programs and utilities don&#x27;t provide a device independent stdin and stdout interface, &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; has a built-in library of programs that can be called in a pipeline specification. These built-in programs interface to the operating system, and perform many utility functions.

Data on CMS is structured in logical records rather than a stream of bytes. For textual data a line of text corresponds to a logical record. In &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; the data is passed between the stages as logical records.

&quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; users issue pipeline commands from the terminal or in EXEC procedures. Users can write programs in REXX that can be used in addition to the built-in programs.

==Example==
A simple example that reads a disk file, separates records containing the string &quot;Hello&quot; from those that do not. The selected records are modified by appending the string &quot;World!&quot; to each of them; the other records are translated to upper case. The two streams are then combined and the records are written to a new output file.

 PIPE (end ?) 
 &lt; input txt 
 | a: locate /Hello/ 
 | insert / World!/ after
 | i: faninany
 | &gt; newfile txt a
 ? a:
 | xlate upper
 | i:

In this example, the codice_3 stage reads the input disk file and passes the records to the next stage in the pipeline. The codice_4 stage separates the input stream into two output streams. The primary output of codice_4 (records containing Hello) passes the records to the codice_6 stage. The codice_6 stage modifies the input records as specified in its arguments and passes them to its output. The output is connected to codice_8 that combines records from all input streams to form a single output stream. The output is written to the new disk file.

The secondary output of codice_4 (marked by the second occurrence of the codice_10 label) contains the records that did not meet the selection criterion. These records are translated to upper case (by the codice_11 stage) and passed to the secondary input stream of codice_8 (marked by the second occurrence of the codice_13 label).

The pipeline topology in this example consists of two connected pipelines. The &quot;end character&quot; (the codice_14 in this example) separates the individual pipelines in the pipeline set. Records read from the input file pass through either of the two routes of the pipeline topology. Because neither of the routes contain stages that need to buffer records, &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; ensures that records arrive at codice_8 in the order in which they passed through codice_4.

The example pipeline is presented in &#x27;portrait form&#x27; with the individual stages on separate lines. When a pipeline is typed as a CMS command, all stages are written on a single line.

==Features==
The concept of a simple pipeline is extended in these ways:
* A program can define a subroutine pipeline to perform a function on all or part of its input data.
* A network of intersecting pipelines can be defined. Programs can be in several pipelines concurrently, which gives the program access to multiple data streams.
* Data passed from one stage to the next is structured as records. This allows stages to operate on a single record without the no need for arbitrary buffering of data to scan for special characters that separate the individual lines.
* Stages normally access the input record in locate mode, and produce the output records before consuming the input record. This lock-step approach not only avoids copying the data from one buffer to the next; it also makes it possible to predict the flow of records in multi-stream pipelines.
* A program can dynamically redefine the pipeline topology. It can replace itself with another pipeline, it can insert a pipeline segment before or after itself, or both. A program can use data in the pipeline to build pipeline specifications.

&quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; offers several features to improve the robustness of programs:
* A syntax error in the overall pipeline structure or in any one program causes the entire pipeline to be suppressed.
* Startup of the programs in the pipeline and allocation of resources is coordinated by the &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; dispatcher. Individual programs can participate in that coordination to ensure irreversible actions are postponed to a point where all programs in the pipelines have had a chance to verify the arguments and are ready to process data. When the pipeline is terminated, the dispatcher ensures resources are released again.
* Errors that occur while data flow in the pipeline can be detected by all participating programs. For example, a disk file might not be replaced in such circumstances.

==History==
John Hartmann, of IBM Denmark, started development of &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; in 1980. The product was marketed by IBM as a separate product during the 80&#x27;s and integrated in VM/ESA late 1991. 
With each release of VM, the &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; code was upgraded as well until it was functionally frozen at the 1.1.10 level in VM/ESA 2.3 in 1997. Since then, the latest level of &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; has been available for download from the CMS Pipelines homepage for users who wish to explore new function.

The current level of &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; is included in the z/VM releases again since z/VM 6.4, available since November 11, 2016.

An implementation of &quot;CMS Pipelines&quot; for TSO was released in 1995 as BatchPipeWorks in the BatchPipes/MVS product. The up-to-date TSO implementation has been available as a Service Offering from IBM Denmark until 2010.

Both versions are maintained from a single source code base and commonly referred to as &quot;CMS/TSO Pipelines&quot;. The specification is available in the Author&#x27;s Edition.

<text>Discovery, Inc. was an American multinational mass media factual television conglomerate based in New York City. Established in 1982, the company operated a group of factual and lifestyle television brands, such as the namesake Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Science Channel, and TLC. In 2018, the company acquired Scripps Networks Interactive, adding networks such as Food Network, HGTV, and Travel Channel to its portfolio. Since the purchase, Discovery described itself as serving members of &quot;passionate&quot; audiences, and also placed a focus on streaming services built around its properties.

Discovery owned or had interests in local versions of its channel brands in international markets, in addition to its other major regional operations such as Eurosport (a pan-European group of sports channels, most prominently the rightsholder of the Olympic Games throughout most of Europe), GolfTV (an international golf-focused streaming service, which is the international digital rightsholder of the PGA Tour), Discovery Communications Nordic (which operates general-interest channels in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland), TVN Group in Poland, and a portfolio of various free-to-air channels in Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

In May 2021, AT&amp;T announced its proposal to merge its media subsidiary WarnerMedia with Discovery, Inc. The transaction was approved by the European Commission in December 2021 and was completed on April 8, 2022, forming Warner Bros. Discovery.

== History ==

The company was established in 1982 in Landover, Maryland as the Cable Educational Network. Its namesake and flagship brand, Discovery Channel, first launched on June 17, 1985. In 1991, Discovery Channel&#x27;s owners acquired The Learning Channel. Three years later, Cable Educational Network was renamed Discovery Communications.

In October 1996, Discovery launched several new spin-off networks, including Animal Planet, and the digital cable channels Discovery Kids, Discovery Travel &amp; Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. This was followed by the 1997 purchase of a 70% stake in Travel Channel, and the 1998 launches of Discovery en Español, Discovery Wings, and Discovery Health Channel. Also in 1998, Discovery acquired a stake in the struggling CBS Eye on People channel; Discovery eventually acquired the remainder of CBS&#x27;s stake, leading to its January 1999 relaunch as Discovery People. The network quietly folded in 2000, being replaced by other Discovery channels on providers.

On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Channel, and announced that it would be re-branded as FitTV. In 2002, Discovery relaunched Discovery Civilization as Discovery Times, as part of a joint venture with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In June 2002, coinciding with Discovery&#x27;s 17th anniversary, the company launched a 24/7 high definition channel known as Discovery HD Theater. In 2003, Discovery Communications moved its headquarters from Bethesda to Silver Spring. In 2003 and 2004, Discovery acquired academic film companies such as AGC, AIMS Multimedia, and Clearvue &amp; SVE to form Discovery Education, which is now led by Jeremy Cowdrey, former CEO of Imagine Learning. In 2019, Discovery Communications moved its headquarters to New York City, keeping 300 employees in a smaller hub in Silver Spring.

=== Zaslav era ===
Former NBCUniversal executive David Zaslav was named president and CEO of Discovery Communications on November 16, 2006. In the years that followed, Zaslav placed a major focus on bolstering Discovery&#x27;s core networks, programming, and expanding the company&#x27;s reach into digital media. He described these goals as reflecting an expansion into becoming a &quot;content company&quot; rather than just a &quot;cable company&quot;.

In March 2007, Discovery sold its stake in Travel Channel back to Cox Communications, in exchange for the stake in Discovery that Cox owned. Cox would later sell the controlling interest in the channel to Scripps Networks Interactive in 2009. In June 2008, Discovery Home was replaced by Planet Green, a network devoted primarily to environmentalism and sustainable living.

In 2007, according to Crunchbase, TreeHugger was acquired by Discovery Communications on August 1, 2007, for $10 million. In 2012, Mother Nature Network, founded by Joel Babbit and Chuck Leavell (now Narrative Content Group) acquired TreeHugger.

On January 15, 2008, Discovery announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Harpo Productions to relaunch Discovery Health as a new service, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in 2009. In 2008, Discovery Times was relaunched as Investigation Discovery, a new brand that would be dedicated to true crime programs and documentaries. The company also formed its Emerging Networks Group, and named Clark Bunting as president and Clint Stinchcomb as executive vice president and general manager. On April 30, 2009, Discovery announced a joint venture with Hasbro to relaunch Discovery Kids as a new youth- and family-oriented entertainment channel. The channel, ultimately named The Hub, launched on October 10, 2010. After multiple delays, OWN officially launched on January 1, 2011.

On March 17, 2009, Discovery Communications sued Amazon.com for patent infringement by its Kindle e-reader line, regarding &quot;secure distribution of electronic text and graphics to subscribers and secure storage&quot;. The patents were originally developed by Discovery founder John Hendricks, who had been developing technologies related to e-books and the digitization of television programs. While Discovery had divested the television-related patents, it retained the e-book patents. Amazon subsequently accused Discovery of violating a patent for an &quot;Internet-based customer referral system&quot;; The two parties settled in 2011.

On October 4, 2011, due to the wider implementation of high-definition feeds for mainstream cable channels, HD Theater was relaunched as Velocity, a new &quot;upscale male&quot; network focusing on automotive programming. On May 26, 2012, Planet Green (which had begun to abandon its original concept in 2010 due to poor viewership) was relaunched as Destination America.

In January 2014, Discovery launched Curiosity, a website that aggregates online education content.

In April 2014, Discovery made an investment and strategic partnership with Dog TV, a television network made specifically for dogs.

In May 2014, Discovery and its shareholder Liberty Media acquired British television studio All3Media for $930 million in a 50/50 joint venture. The new ownership stated that All3Media would be operated as an independent company. In October 2014, Discovery acquired controlling interest in Hub Network from Hasbro and re-branded it as Discovery Family. During the same month of that year, Discovery Communications announced a special dividend of shares of the company&#x27;s Series C common stock payable to holders of record of the company&#x27;s Series A common stock, Series B common stock and Series C common stock as of the close of business on July 28, 2014. As a result of the dividend, each holder of a share of the company&#x27;s Series A common stock, Series B common stock or Series C common stock will receive one additional share of the company&#x27;s Series C common stock on or about August 6, 2014. In November 2014, Curiosity was spun out as a venture-funded startup, receiving $6 million in funding.

In November 2015, Discovery Communications and Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lionsgate Entertainment with Discovery CEO David Zaslav joining the Lionsgate board of directors as part of the acquisition. In December 2015, Discovery launched Discovery Go, a TV Everywhere service offering access to live streaming and on-demand content from Discovery Communications&#x27; cable networks.

In May 2016, Discovery initiated a restructuring plan aiming to save $40 to $60 million by the third quarter of 2016, including a shift in strategy to &quot;maximize&quot; its linear television business whilst plotting larger investments in content, digital media, sports, and international markets. In August 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in the Hong Kong-based digital talent and content company VS Media; Discovery intended to have VS distribute Discovery Digital Networks content in China, and to offer their own resources to VS.

In October 2016, Discovery purchased a minority stake in Group Nine Media, a digital media holding company consisting of Thrillist Media Group, NowThis, The Dodo and Discovery&#x27;s digital network Seeker—for $100 million. The transaction gave Discovery an option to acquire a majority stake at a later date.

=== Acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive ===
On July 31, 2017, Discovery announced it would acquire Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of networks such as Food Network, HGTV, and DIY Network, for $14.6 billion, pending regulatory approval. On March 6, 2018, the acquisition was completed, with the company renamed as Discovery, Inc. afterwards. Following the purchase, SNI shareholders owned 20% of Discovery&#x27;s stock. Discovery retained an operational hub in SNI&#x27;s home city of Knoxville, but planned to move its corporate headquarters from Silver Spring, Maryland, where it had operated since 2003, to New York City in late-2019.

Discovery&#x27;s brands were reorganized into two groups under different chief brand officers: SNI&#x27;s chief programmer Kathleen Finch became chief brand officer of Lifestyle, overseeing TLC, the six former Scripps channels, and Discovery&#x27;s other lifestyle networks. Rich Ross, who formerly served as group president of Discovery and Science, stepped down, and would be replaced by TLC president Nancy Daniels as chief brand officer of Discovery &amp; Factual.

An on-air result of the acquisition were multiple programs featuring crossovers between TLC and Scripps talent, such as the Food Network series &quot;Buddy vs. Duff&quot; (a cake design competition series starring Buddy Valastro and Duff Goldman of the TLC and Food Network programs &quot;Cake Boss&quot; and &quot;Ace of Cakes&quot;), and a revival of TLC&#x27;s &quot;While You Were Out&quot; incorporating HGTV personalities.

On August 3, 2017, Discovery announced that it would contribute Velocity into a joint venture with the digital, live events, and direct-to-consumer businesses of automotive publisher TEN: The Enthusiast Network. Discovery will hold a majority stake in the venture; it will not include TEN&#x27;s print brands, but there will be opportunities for cross-promotion. In April 2018, it was announced that TEN had been renamed Motor Trend Group, and that Velocity would be re-branded as an extension of its namesake magazine &quot;Motor Trend&quot;.

In December 2017, Discovery announced that it would acquire an additional 24.5% stake in OWN that it did not already own, for $70 million. Oprah Winfrey will remain as CEO of OWN, and extended her exclusivity agreement with the network and Discovery through 2025. Harpo Productions retains a &quot;significant minority stake&quot; in the venture. In February 2018, Discovery sold a majority stake in Discovery Education to the private equity firm Francisco Partners.

=== Focus on direct-to-consumer services ===
During its 2018 upfronts, Zaslav stated that the company was now strongly focused on serving &quot;passionate fans and passionate audiences&quot;, and was preparing to increase its focus on direct-to-consumer offerings targeting such audiences. The SNI purchase, Eurosport&#x27;s Olympics rights, and the aforementioned &quot;Motor Trend&quot;-branded network were described as being examples of this strategy. Food Network Kitchen would also launch in 2019, with a focus on live and on-demand cooking classes.

In June 2018, Discovery announced a 12-year agreement to acquire the international media rights to the PGA Tour, with plans to develop an international streaming service to house these rights. The service was officially announced in October 2018 as GolfTV, with Eurosport executive vice president Alex Kaplan named the president and general manager of Discovery Golf. Former Amazon executive Peter Faricy, who was named Discovery&#x27;s chief executive of global direct-to-consumer operations in August 2018, considered GolfTV consistent with the aforementioned strategy, as golf was one of several sports &quot;where people&#x27;s passions and their interest in participating and learning more becomes a core part of their life.&quot;

With Discovery choosing 230 Park Avenue South as its new New York City headquarters, Discovery sold its former Silver Spring headquarters to Foulger-Pratt and Cerberus Capital Management in September 2018, and leased a smaller space at nearby 8403 Colesville Road.

In November 2018, Chip and Joanna Gaines of the former HGTV series &quot;Fixer Upper&quot; announced on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, that they were in early talks to form a &quot;lifestyle focused media network&quot; with Discovery named after their personal company Magnolia. It was reported that Discovery had considered rebranding either DIY Network or Great American Country as this new channel. In April 2019, Discovery confirmed its Magnolia joint venture, which is scheduled to launch in 2020 and replace DIY Network, with an over-the-top subscription component to launch later. Magnolia Network was originally scheduled to launch on October 4, 2020, but it was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. It was also announced that &quot;Fixer Upper&quot; would be revived for the new channel.

In January 2019, Discovery increased its ownership of Play Sports Group, operator of the YouTube channel Global Cycling Network, to 71%. Discovery previously acquired a 20% share in 2017. The group is the foundation for an in development global cycling OTT service.

On April 1, 2019, after a previous agreement with the broadcaster lapsed six years prior, Discovery announced a 10-year global content partnership with BBC Studios, under which it will become the exclusive subscription video-on-demand rightsholder of programming from the BBC Natural History Unit (which will become the basis of an international subscription service by 2020) outside of China, Ireland, and the UK. In addition, Discovery and the BBC reached an agreement to break up their UKTV joint venture (which was inherited from Scripps), with Discovery acquiring the BBC&#x27;s shares in the Good Food, Home, and Really channels, and BBC Studios acquiring Discovery&#x27;s shares in the seven remaining channels, and its streaming platform UKTV Play. Home was later rebranded as a local version of HGTV, and Good Food was closed in favor of the local version of Food Network.

On May 13, 2019, Discovery announced that it would acquire &quot;Golf Digest&quot; from Condé Nast to integrate into its Discovery Golf division.

In March 2020, Discovery began to deploy a new direct-to-consumer brand known as Discovery+, initially in India, which would focus on content from across its factual and lifestyle television brands, as well as the BBC. In December 2020, Discovery announced that it would launch Discovery+ in the United States on January 4, 2021, which would feature new exclusive programming from across Discovery&#x27;s brands, and previews of Magnolia Network (whose linear launch had since been delayed to 2022).

In May 2021, Discovery formed a multi-platform content partnership with the Georgia Aquarium.

===Merger with WarnerMedia===

On May 17, 2021, AT&amp;T announced that it had reached an agreement to merge its content and broadcasting subsidiary, WarnerMedia (the former Time Warner, which AT&amp;T had acquired in 2018 for just over $85 billion in an attempt to become a vertically integrated media conglomerate) with Discovery Inc. to form a new company, subject to regulatory approval. The merger, scheduled to be completed in mid-2022, would be structured as a Reverse Morris Trust; AT&amp;T shareholders will hold a 71% interest in the new company&#x27;s stock and appoint seven board members, and Discovery shareholders will hold 29% and appoint six board members. AT&amp;T will receive $43 billion in cash and debt from the spin-off.

Zaslav will lead the new company. He stated that the new company&#x27;s goal would be to &quot;[tell] the most amazing stories and have a ton of fun doing it&quot;, and emphasized that the two companies spend over $20 billion annually on content (outpacing Disney, Netflix and even Amazon). The company will aim to expand their streaming services (which includes WarnerMedia&#x27;s HBO Max) to reach 400 million global subscribers.

On June 1, 2021, it was announced that the merged company would be known as Warner Bros. Discovery, and an interim wordmark was unveiled with the tagline &quot;The stuff dreams are made from&quot;—a line from the 1941 Warner Bros. film &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. Zaslav stated that the name would reflect &quot;the combination of Warner Bros.&#x27; fabled hundred-year legacy of creative, authentic storytelling and taking bold risks to bring the most amazing stories to life, with Discovery&#x27;s global brand that has always stood brightly for integrity, innovation and inspiration&quot;. On June 7, 2021, Discovery announced that it would divest Great American Country to GAC Media, a new Fort Worth-based investment group led by Tom Hicks and former Crown Media Holdings CEO Bill Abbott.

Electronic Arts, who were a bidder in the proposed sale of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, purchased the mobile gaming studio Playdemic from WBIE for in the same month.

In September 2021, Fox Corporation acquired TMZ from WarnerMedia in a deal worth about $50 million with TMZ being operated under the Fox Entertainment division.

In November 2021, Discovery and WarnerMedia discussed a plan to combine the two streaming services, HBO Max and Discovery+, into one streaming service in two phases: an initial phase that allows for quick bundling of the services and a second phase that allows for a common service on one tech platform. In the same month, it was announced that Discovery will rename itself Warner Bros. Discovery and reclassify and convert its stock into stock of WBD.

On December 22, 2021, it was announced that the transaction was approved by the European Commission and it is expected to be completed in mid-2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and additional closing conditions.

On January 5, 2022, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that WarnerMedia and Paramount Global (at the time known as ViacomCBS) were exploring a possible sale of either a majority stake or all of The CW, and that Nexstar Media Group (which became The CW&#x27;s largest affiliate group when it acquired former WB co-owner Tribune Broadcasting in 2019) was considered a leading bidder. The news led to speculation that, should a sale take place, new ownership could steer the network in a new direction, transforming The CW from a young adult-oriented network into one that featured more unscripted and even national news programming. However, reports also indicated that WarnerMedia and ViacomCBS could include a contractual commitment that would require any new owner to buy new programming from those companies, allowing them to reap some continual revenue through the network. Network president/CEO Mark Pedowitz confirmed talks of a potential sale in a memo to CW staffers, but added that &quot;It&#x27;s too early to speculate what might happen&quot; and that the network &quot;must continue to do what we do best.&quot;

On January 26, 2022, it was reported that the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. was expected to close sometime during the second quarter of 2022. This was later narrowed down to mid-April 2022. On February 1, 2022, it was reported that AT&amp;T had elected to structure the merger as a spin-off of WarnerMedia, followed by a merger with Discovery Inc. to form the new company. The company had been contemplating structuring the transaction as a split-off (under which AT&amp;T shareholders would be given the option as to whether to exchange their shares for those of the new company, rather than receive them pro rata). On February 7, the merger was approved by the Brazilian antitrust regulator Cade. It was approved by the United States Department of Justice two days later.

The transaction was approved by Discovery shareholders on March 11, and formally completed on April 8, 2022.

== 2010 hostage crisis ==
On September 1, 2010, the Discovery headquarters were the site of a hostage taking; a lone gunman identified as James J. Lee ( – September 1, 2010), armed with two starter pistols and an explosive device, took three people hostage inside of the Discovery Communications headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, prompting an evacuation of the building.
Lee&#x27;s motive was believed to have been grounded in environmental activism. Lee had previously been arrested in 2008 while protesting in front of the same site.

The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland has since labeled the crime a terrorist attack.

The incident began at 1:00 p.m. ET, when the 43-year-old Lee entered the building with two starter pistols and fired a single round at the ceiling of the lobby. The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) confirmed that Lee had an explosive device and was holding three people hostage in the lobby. The building was placed on lockdown and most of the 1,500 employees were evacuated. Children from a day care center inside were safely removed to a nearby McDonald&#x27;s restaurant on Colesville Rd. Lee was shot and killed by an MCPD SWAT team at 4:48 p.m. ET after the hostages made a run to escape. The remaining hostages were immediately freed. The incident was described by the FBI as the first instance of a would-be suicide bomber taking hostages in the United States.

Lee was an environmental protester who, in 2008, was given six months of supervised probation and fined $500 after he was arrested during a protest outside the Discovery Communications headquarters. Lee had published criticisms of the network in an online manifesto at Savetheplanetprotest.com, among which was a demand for the company to cease the broadcasting of television series displaying or encouraging the birth of &quot;parasitic human infants and the false heroics behind those actions&quot;. His manifesto also railed against &quot;immigration pollution and anchor baby filth&quot;, leading commentators such as Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center to decry Lee as an &quot;eco-fascist&quot;. Lee&#x27;s opinions were dominated by Malthusian analysis, though he also cited works ranging from Daniel Quinn&#x27;s novel &quot;My Ishmael&quot; to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore&#x27;s documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; credited the Twitter community for initially breaking the story.

<text>The Petite France (), in Alsatian dialect: Französel (also known as the Quartier des Tanneurs; ; &quot;Tanner&#x27;s Quarter&quot;) is the south-western part of the Grande Île of Strasbourg in Alsace in eastern France, the most central and characteristic island of the city that forms the historic center. The district is bounded to the north by the Quai de la Bruche (Brischstade), the Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes, the Place Benjamin-Zix and the Rue des Dentelles; to the east by the Rue du Pont-Saint-Martin, the Pont Saint-Thomas (Thomas Bridge) and the Mills footbridge; to the south by the Channel of &quot;Zorn-Mühle&quot;; to the west by the Covered Bridges.

At Petite France, the river Ill splits up into a number of channels that cascade through an area that was, in the Middle Ages, home to the city&#x27;s tanners, millers and fishermen, and is now one of Strasbourg&#x27;s main tourist attractions. Petite France forms part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Grande Île, designated in 1988.

== History ==
=== Pflanzbad, Mühlenplan, Gedeckte Brücken ===
The Petite France district did not emerge as an urban entity until the 20th century. Originally, the term &quot;Little France&quot; was reserved for the dam that separates the Spitzmühlen Canal from the shipping canal. Up until the 19th century, the three units that make up the district today were called in Alsatian dialect &quot;Am Pflanzbad&quot;, &quot;Der Mühlenplan&quot; and &quot;Bei den Gedeckten Brücken&quot;. 

In the 13th century, the Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes, the main street of the quarter, was known as &quot;Glanzhof&quot;, in the 15th century it became the &quot;Pflanzhof&quot;, and later the &quot;Pflanzbad&quot;. This designation referred to a public bathhouse (No. 22) in which women underwent a bath treatment with fragrant and beneficial herbs.

The &quot;Mühlenplan&quot; still corresponds to the Rue des Moulins, which is sometimes also called the mill quarter. Petite France is therefore not a historical district in the narrower sense, but a picturesque district that emerged with its narrow alleys of half-timbered houses on the banks of the Ill and was not very popular at the time because of the tanneries (white and red tanners) and the associated smells. In addition to the tanners and mill owners, poor fishermen, executioners and prostitutes also lived here. Due to the poverty, many houses were built in half-timbered construction. The origin goes back to the 16th century. 

Just upstream of Petite France, the river Ill flows through the &quot;Barrage Vauban&quot;, a defensive structure built at the end of the 17th century. Downstream of this, the river splits into the Canal du Faux-Rempart, which flows to the north of the Grande Île, and four channels which flow through the Petite France quarter before reuniting in the main channel of the river, flowing to the south of the Grande Île. These four channels are spanned by the &quot;Ponts Couverts&quot;, an earlier defensive structure of three bridges and four towers that, despite its name, has not been covered since the 18th century.

Downstream of the &quot;Ponts Couverts&quot;, the four channels flow through an area of largely half-timbered buildings which, together with the narrow lanes and footbridges that connect them, mostly date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The sloping roofs of many of the buildings include open lofts where hides were once dried. Three of the four channels flowing through the quarter run over weirs that once drove mills and other industries, whilst the northernmost channel is navigable. This passes through a lock and the &quot;Pont du Faisan&quot; swing bridge in the centre of the quarter, and is largely used by passenger trip boats.

On the north bank of the Ill at the heart of the quarter is the &quot;Maison des Tanneurs&quot;, home of the Tanner&#x27;s Guild, and &quot;Place Benjamin-Zix&quot;. From this square lead several streets, including the &quot;Rue du Bain-aux-Plantes&quot; and the &quot;Rue des Dentelles&quot;, also lined by half-timbered houses. To the east these lead to the Saint-Thomas church, the city’s main Lutheran church, and to the west back to the &quot;Pont Couverts&quot; and to the Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux church, actually two churches (one Protestant and one Catholic) in the same building.

=== Hospice of the Incurable ===
The origin of the name Petite-France (&quot;Little France&quot;) was not given for patriotic or architectural reasons. It can be found in the Alsatian name &quot;Blatterhüs&quot; of a hospice for the incurable, originally founded in the &quot;Finkwiller&quot; district and then moved in 1687 to a new building at 6 rue des Moulins, on what is now the &quot;Quai de la Petite-France&quot; (&quot;Blodergängel&quot; in Alsatian during the 18th and 19th centuries), where it operated for a period of almost 300 years until 1789 in the then German-speaking and culturally German-influenced Lutheran University City of Strasbourg. Until 1789, all of Alsace was a foreign country under customs law (province à l&#x27;instar de l&#x27;étranger effectif), i.e. it had a customs border with France, but not with the Holy Roman Empire. The hospice was founded in 1503 by Gaspard Hofmeister, a citizen of the city, for the Landsknechte of Charles VIII of France, who had contracted syphilis during the Italian wars. The return of the Landsknechte from the siege of Naples brought syphilis to the region. The hospice had been expanded in 1506 and 1522 before being moved in 1687. Syphilis is a disease that appeared suddenly in Europe at the end of the 15th century and soon required considerable care for the often marginalized patients. The population called the hospice &quot;Zum Französel&quot; at the time - syphilis was considered a &quot;French disease&quot;. In the 18th century the place was called the Hospice of the Incurable. In 1795 the building was referred to as &quot;La Petite France&quot;, then by extension the entire district.
