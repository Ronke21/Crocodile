<text>The Mumbai Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Mumbai and the wider Mumbai Metropolitan Region in Maharashtra, India.

While the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited is responsible for all metro rail projects being developed in Maharashtra, except for those in the Mumbai Metropolitan Area, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is the authority responsible for maintaining the metro system in the Greater Mumbai area.

The rapid transit metro system is designed to reduce traffic congestion in the city and supplement the overcrowded Mumbai Suburban Railway network. It is being built in three phases, over 15 years, with overall completion expected in October 2026. The Mumbai Metro is the fourth longest operational metro network in India with an operational length of as of January 2023. When completed, the core system will comprise sixteen high-capacity metro railway lines, spanning a total of more than (25% underground, the rest elevated, with a minuscule portion built at-grade) and serviced by 350 stations.

Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro is operated by Mumbai Metro One Private Limited (MMOPL), a joint venture between Reliance Infrastructure (50%), Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, (50%) and formerly by RATP Dev Transdev Asia (5%) and Hong Kong MTR. While lines 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and their extensions will be built and operated by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the completely underground Line 3 and Line 11 will be built by Mumbai Metro Railway Corporation Limited (MMRCL).

In June 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone for the first phase of the Mumbai Metro project, although construction work began in February 2008. A successful trial run was conducted in May 2013, and the system&#x27;s first line commenced operations on 8 June 2014. Many metro projects were delayed because of late environmental clearances, land acquisition troubles and protests.

After nearly eight years, two new metro corridors, 2A and 7, were inaugurated on 2 April 2022, and are now operational. On 5 October 2024, the 12 km underground BKC to Aarey Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road section of Aqua Line was inaugurated. Additionally, there are 8 other metro lines currently under construction in the city.

==History==
Being the capital of Maharashtra, Mumbai is among the largest cities in the world, with a total metropolitan area population of over 2 crore (20 million) as of 2011, and a population growth rate of around 2% per annum. Mumbai has the advantage of a high modal share of the public (88%) in favour of a public mass transport system. The existing Mumbai Suburban Railway carries over 70 lakh (7 million) passengers per day, and is supplemented by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus system, which provides feeder services to station-going passengers to allow them to complete their journeys. Until 1980s, transport in Mumbai was not a big problem. The discontinuation of trams resulted in a direct increase of passenger pressure on the suburban railway network. By 2010, the population of Mumbai doubled. However, due to the city&#x27;s geographical constraints and rapid population growth, road and rail infrastructure development has not been able to keep pace with growing demand over the last 4-5 decades. Moreover, the Mumbai Suburban Railway, though extensive, is not built to rapid transit specifications. The main objective of the Mumbai Metro is to provide mass rapid transit services to people within an approach distance of between , and to serve the areas not connected by the existing Suburban Rail network.
The master plan unveiled by the MMRDA in 2004 encompassed a total of of track, of which would be underground. The Mumbai Metro was proposed to be built in three phases, at an estimated cost of 19,525 crore. In September 2009, the proposed Hutatma Chowk – Ghatkopar was reduced to a line between Hutatma Chowk and Carnac Bunder.

In 2011, the MMRDA unveiled plans for an extended Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ metro line. According to its earlier plans, a Colaba-to-Bandra metro line was to be constructed, running underground for from Colaba to Mahalaxmi, and then on an elevated track from Mahalaxmi to Bandra. However, the MMRDA decided to increase ridership on the line by running it out past Bandra to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. The Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ line will be built at a cost of , and will be the city&#x27;s first underground metro line. It will have 27 stations.On 27 February 2012, the Union Government gave in-principle approval to the plan for Line 3. Money for the project is being borrowed from Japanese International Cooperation Agency (50%), the state government (16%), the central government (14%), and others. In April 2012, the MMRDA announced plans to grant the Mumbai Metro Rail Company increased management autonomy, in an effort to enhance the project&#x27;s operational efficiency. In July 2012, the MMRDA announced plans to add more metro lines to its existing plan, including a line parallel to the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Dahisar. This line is expected to reduce the passenger load on the Western Line and vehicle traffic on the highway. Another proposed route, the , 28-station Wadala–Kasarvadavali line, received in-principle approval from the state government in 2013. The MMRDA also intends to convert the proposed Lokhandwala–SEEPZ–Kanjurmarg monorail route into a metro line. The Mumbai Metro master plan was revised by the MMRDA in 2012, increasing the total length of the proposed network to . In June 2015, two new lines were proposed. A line from Andheri West to Dahisar West, and a line from BKC to Mankhurd. The following table shows the updated master plan unveiled by the MMRDA: 


On 18 February 2013, the MMRDA signed a memorandum of understanding with Transport for London, the transit authority in Greater London. The arrangement will facilitate the exchange of information, personnel and technology in the transportation sector.

The revised Mumbai Metro master plan had proposed a line along the Thane-Teen Haath Naka-Kaapurbavdi-Ghodbunder Road route. The feasibility report concluded that the line was not feasible as most residents of Thane and its neighbouring areas travelled to Mumbai for work daily. On 14 June 2014, Chavan announced that the MMRDA was instead examining a proposal for a metro line along the new proposed route of Wadala-Ghatkopar-Teen Haat Naka route. RITES will prepare the detailed project report and is expected to submit it by August 2014. The preliminary report proposed a line with 29 stations, to be built at an estimated cost of 22,000 crore. This would be the fourth line of the metro, after the previously proposed Charkop-Dahisar route was merged with the Charkop-Bandra-Mankhurd route to form Line 2.

In May 2015, the MMRDA said that it had begun planning for the Andheri-Dahisar line and Seepz-Kanjurmarg. Both lines are expected to be elevated, although the latter could be constructed underground if a proposal to extend Line 3 to Kanjurmarg is undertaken. DPRs for both lines had been prepared in 2004, along with the master plan, and the MMRDA would now update the DPRs. The agency also intends to construct Line 9 of the metro as an underground corridor from Sewri to Worli. However, planning for the project will only begun after the construction of the proposed Mumbai Trans Harbour Link commences.

In a report on 14 November 2014 about the cancellation of the PPP agreement for Line 2, &quot;Mint&quot; quoted a senior MMRDA official: &quot;as decided earlier, all future lines of Mumbai Metro will be constructed by the Mumbai Metro Railway Corp. Ltd (MMRCL), a joint venture between the state government and the Union government.&quot; On 20 May 2015, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis requested officials to consider constructing the Charkop-Bandra-Dahisar and the Wadala-Thane-Kasarvadavali lines as elevated corridors. Although both corridors had been planned as elevated lines in the Mumbai Metro master plan, the previous Congress-NCP had decided to construct all metro lines underground, after delays and difficulties caused by acquiring land for Line 1. However, Fadnavis believes that the two proposed lines can be constructed quicker and cheaper if they were elevated due to the proposed route of the alignment. The Government plans to implement all future metro lines (except Line 3) as elevated corridors. On 15 June 2015, the MMRDA announced that it would implement Line 2 of the metro in three parts. The Andheri-Dahisar line will have connectivity with the existing Line 1 and the proposed JVLR-Kanjurmarg line.

In June 2015, Fadnavis announced that he would request the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to assist in the implementation of the Mumbai Metro. He said that he intends to expand the metro system by before the state assembly elections in October 2019. In July 2015, UPS Madan announced that the State Government formally appointed the DMRC to revise and update the Mumbai Metro master plan. The DMRC will prepare DPRs for the Andheri East to Dahisar East, Jogeshwari to Kanjurmarg, Andheri West to Dahisar West and Bandra Kurla Complex to Mankhurd lines. The Andheri-Dahisar line will have connectivity with the existing Line 1 and the proposed JVLR-Kanjurmarg line. All four lines are proposed to be elevated and constructed as cash contracts. The lines are estimated to cost a total of , or about per km. In addition, the planned Line 3 and Wadala-Ghatkopar-Thane-Kasarvadavli line of the metro would also be constructed.

Fadnavis announced on 8 April 2017 that the government was considering a circular metro loop line along the Kalyan-Dombivli-Taloja route. The proposed line would link Kalyan and Shil Phata with 13 stations, bring metro connectivity to Kalyan East, Dombivli, Ambernath and Diva.

The Mumbai Metro resumed services for general public on 19 October 2020, after being shut down since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Protests and delay==
The project has faced significant and costly legal challenges. In 2018, protestors rallied to protect trees that were to be chopped down as part of construction plans. The central government first proposed the construction of a metro station at the forest area of Aarey colony. The protest resulted in several arrests. Protests again flared in 2022.
==Lines==


Line 1 connects Versova in the Western Suburbs to Ghatkopar in the Central Suburbs, covering a distance of . It is fully elevated, and consists of 12 stations. Work on the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar corridor, a part of Phase I, began on 8 February 2008. A crucial bridge on the project was completed at the end of 2012. The line opened for service on 8 June 2014.

This corridor is being executed in two phases. 

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched phase 2A in January 2023. The long 2A corridor was executed by DMRC on behalf of MMRDA. The corridor has 17 stations (Dahisar (West) to D N Nagar), and cost .

The line was approved by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on 19 October 2016. The MMRDA issued a tender to conduct a detailed aerial mapping survey of the alignment in April 2017. Authorities will also be able to determine the location of trees along the alignment accuracy of up to 10 cm utilizing a differential GPS (DGPS), while a digital aerial triangulation system will help determine the types of trees, their heights and diameters. Line-6&#x27;s first section is expected to open in 2025.

This corridor is long, and runs from Dahisar (East) in the north to Andheri (East) in the south, with a further extension till Bhayander in the north, and Mumbai International Airport Terminal 2 in the south. The line is partially elevated (under construction, with completion slated for 2019), and partially underground (approved, with construction planned to begin in 2018).

The elevated section is expected to cost , while the outlay for the recently approved underground section is . Civil works, including viaduct and station works, is being executed by NCC, Simplex Infrastructure, and J. Kumar Infraprojects. The corridor is partially operational since 2 April 2022 and fully operational since 19 January 2023.

A section of Line 7 from Dahisar East to Aarey (along with the section of Line 2 from Dahanukarwadi to Dahisar East ) was opened on 2 April 2022, by the then CM Uddhav Thackeray. The final section of the line (along with the final section of Line 2A from Dhanukarwadi to Andheri West) was inaugurated on 19 January 2023 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This is a proposed metro line between the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport and the under construction Navi Mumbai International Airport. It will connect Mumbai airport to upcoming Navi Mumbai airport and its length would be approx 32 km.

It&#x27;s expected to cost ₹15,000 crore and finish construction by October 2026. The line has an anticipated daily ridership of 3 lakh.

==Network==

Lines on the Mumbai Metro are currently identified by numbers. In March 2016, MMRDA Metropolitan Commissioner, U.P.S. Madan, announced that all lines on the system would be color-coded after more lines are opened.
==Rolling stock==
Reliance Infrastructure consulted a number of major international rolling stock builders to provide the train fleet for the Mumbai Metro. Bidders for the contract included established metro-vehicle manufacturers such as Kawasaki, Alstom, Siemens and Bombardier, but CRRC Nanjing Puzhen of China was ultimately chosen to supply rolling stock for ₹600 crore. In May 2008, CSR Nanjing completed the first 16 trains, each comprising four cars. The first ten trains were reported to be ready for operation in January 2013.

The coaches are fire retardant, air-conditioned and designed to reduce noise and vibration, and will feature both high seating capacity and ample space for standing passengers. They will be outfitted with a number of features for safety and convenience, including LCD screens, 3D route maps, first-aid kits, wheelchair facilities, fire-fighting equipment and intercom systems permitting communication with the train driver. Each coach will furthermore feature a black box to assist in accident investigations. The trains will be capable of carrying over 1,100 passengers in a four-car unit, with each carriage being approximately wide.

In 2018, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation chose Alstom to supply 31 eight car trains for Aqua line (line 3). These trains are capable of driverless operations and were built at Alstom&#x27;s factory in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh.

In 2018, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which will operate all metro lines except Line 3, awarded a tender to Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. (BEML) to supply 63 trainsets (378 coaches) for Yellow Line (Line 2) and Red Line (Line 7) at a cost of ₹3,015 crores ($427.33 million). Capable of driverless operations, the trains are manufactured at BEML&#x27;s factory in Bengaluru and first trainset for the Yellow Line arrived in Mumbai on 27 January 2021, and will continue to receive the rest of the sets until 2022. On 17 January 2021, Bombardier won the tender to supply 234 driverless coaches for the Green Line (Line 4) of six-car configuration for Mumbai metro. However, the contract was cancelled in March 2022 due to delays and uncertainties of the project.

==Power supply==
Mumbai Metro runs on alternating current (AC) which is typically more labour and cost-intensive. MMRDA joint project director Dilip Kawathkar stated that AC power was chosen &quot;after a proper study by a team of experts&quot; which found that the AC model was &quot;a better option&quot;. Bidders for Line 3 were reportedly in favour of the DC model. Experts believe that the decision to use AC will escalate the project cost of underground lines by 15%, since more digging is required for the rail to work on AC.

==Signalling and communications==
The Mumbai Metro will feature an advanced signalling system, including an automatic train protection system (ATPS) and automated signalling to control train movements on the Line 1. A four-minute service interval is anticipated on the route.

Siemens will supply the signalling systems required for the project, while Thales Group will supply the Metro&#x27;s communication systems. The network&#x27;s signalling and train control systems will be based on LZB 700M technology.

==Ridership==
On 21 October 2019, 1,960 days (approx. 5 years) after Mumbai Metro Line 1&#x27;s inception, the system crossed 600 million passengers, with an average daily ridership of around 450,000 passengers.

<text>Carisoprodol, sold under the brand name Soma among others, is an oral medication used for musculoskeletal pain. Effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to six hours. 
Common side effects include headache, dizziness, and sleepiness. Serious side effect may include addiction, allergic reactions, and seizures. In people with a sulfa allergy certain formulations may result in problems. Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not clear. How it works is not clear. Some of its effects are believed to occur following metabolic conversion into meprobamate, carisoprodol&#x27;s main active metabolite.
Carisoprodol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. Its approval in the European Union was withdrawn in 2008. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 343rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800thousand prescriptions. In the United States, it is a Schedule IV controlled substance.

== Medical uses ==
Carisoprodol is meant to be used along with rest, physical therapy and other measures to relax muscles after strains, sprains and muscle injuries. It comes in tablet format and is taken by the mouth three times a day and before bed.

== Side effects ==

The usual dose of 350 mg is unlikely to engender prominent side effects other than somnolence, and mild to significant euphoria or dysphoria, but the euphoria is generally short-lived due to the fast metabolism of carisoprodol into meprobamate and other metabolites; the euphoria derived is, according to new research, most likely due to carisoprodol&#x27;s inherent, potent anxiolytic effects that are far stronger than those produced by its primary metabolite, meprobamate, which is often misblamed for the drug-seeking associated with carisoprodol, as carisoprodol itself is responsible for the significantly more intense central nervous system effects than meprobamate alone. Carisoprodol has a qualitatively different set of effects to that of meprobamate (Miltown). The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient&#x27;s ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs. Other side effects include: dizziness, clumsiness, headache, fast heart rate, upset stomach, vomiting and skin rash.

There are 368 drugs known to interact with carisoprodol including 28 major drug interactions. The interaction of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially codeine, those of the codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) which allows the use of a smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect, is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is a large part of the problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from combining doses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to asphyxiate while unconscious.

Meprobamate and other muscle-relaxing drugs often were subjects of misuse in the 1950s and 60s. Overdose cases were reported as early as 1957, and have been reported on several occasions since then.

Carisoprodol is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, so this drug must be used with caution with patients that have impaired hepatic or renal function. Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid for elderly people.

=== Withdrawal ===

Carisoprodol, meprobamate, and related drugs such as tybamate, have the potential to produce physical dependence of the barbiturate type following periods of prolonged use. Withdrawal of the drug after extensive use may require hospitalization in medically compromised patients. In severe cases the withdrawal can mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal including the potentially lethal status epilepticus.

Psychological dependence has also been linked to carisoprodol use although this is much less severe than with meprobamate itself (presumably due to the slower onset of effects). Psychological dependence is more common in those who use carisoprodol non-medically and those who have a history of substance use (particularly sedatives or alcohol). It may reach clinical significance before physiological tolerance and dependence have occurred and (as with benzodiazepines) has been demonstrated to persist to varying degrees of severity for months or years after discontinuation.

Discontinuation of carisoprodol, as with all GABA-ergics, can result in cognitive changes which persist for weeks, months, or rarely even years including greatly increased anxiety and depression, social withdrawal, hair-trigger agitation/aggression, chronic insomnia, new or aggravated (often illogical) phobias, reduced IQ, short term and long-term memory loss, and dozens of other sequelae. The effects, severity, and duration appear to be slightly dose-dependent but are mainly determined by the patients pattern of use (taken as prescribed, taken in bulk doses, mixed with other drugs, a combination of the above, etc.), genetic predisposition to substance use, and a history of substance use all increase the patients risk of persistent discontinuation syndrome symptoms.

Treatment for physical withdrawal generally involves switching the patient to a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam or clonazepam then slowly titrating them off the replacement drug completely at a rate which is both reasonably comfortable for the patient but rapid enough for the managing physician to consider the rate of progress acceptable (overly rapid dose reduction greatly increases the risk of patient non-compliance such as the use of illicitly obtained alternative sedatives and/or alcohol). Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have demonstrated moderate success in reducing the rebound anxiety which results upon carisoprodol discontinuation but only when combined with regular and active attendance to a substance use support group.

Carisoprodol withdrawal can be life-threatening (especially in high dose users and those who attempt to quit &quot;cold turkey&quot;). Medical supervision is recommended, with gradual reduction of dose of carisoprodol or a substituted medication, typical of other depressant drugs.

===Non-medical use===
Combining a muscle relaxant like carisoprodol with opioids and benzodiazepines is referred to as &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot; as it has been reported to increase the power of the &quot;high&quot;.

Recreational users of carisoprodol usually seek its potentially heavy sedating, relaxant, and anxiolytic effects. Also, because of its potentiating effects on narcotics, it is often used in conjunction with many opioid drugs. Also it is not detected on standard drug testing screens. On 26 March 2010 the DEA issued a Notice of Hearing on proposed rule making in respect to the placement of carisoprodol in schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA ended up classifying it under schedule IV. Carisoprodol is sometimes mixed with date rape drugs.

== Overdose ==

As with other GABAergic drugs, combination with other drugs that depress the respiratory system, such as alcohol, sedatives and opioids possess a significant risk to the user in the form of overdose. Overdose symptoms are similar to those of other GABAergics including excessive sedation and unresponsiveness to stimuli, severe ataxia, amnesia, confusion, agitation, intoxication and inappropriate (potentially violent) behavior. Severe overdoses may present with respiratory depression (and subsequent pulmonary aspiration), coma, and death.

Carisoprodol is not detected on all toxicology tests which may delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms in combination with opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils, which are generally unresponsive to light. Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective in the management of carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as indicated and, in rare cases, bemegride. Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery.

In 2014 actress Skye McCole Bartusiak died of an overdose due to the combined effects of carisoprodol, hydrocodone and difluoroethane.

In 1999 actress Dana Plato died after taking carisoprodol (Soma) along with a few doses of a hydrocodone / acetaminophen painkiller (Lortab), in an overdose that was ruled a suicide.

== Pharmacology ==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Carisoprodol, has a chemical structure similar to glutamate, a neurotransmitter, and dimethylglycine.

Carisoprodol&#x27;s structural similarity to meprobamate indicates GABAergic activity, including GABAA agonism, similar to the mechanism of benzodiazepines.
This will allow for further muscle relaxation and anxiety reduction. Therefore, carisoprodol, at low to moderate dosages, may be clinically indicated for absent seizures, yet exacerbate tonic-clonic seizures.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Carisoprodol has a rapid, 30-minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 oxidase isozyme CYP2C19, excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life. In patients with low levels of CYP2C19 (poor metabolizers), standard doses can lead to increased concentrations of carisoprodol (up-to a four-fold increase). A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate, which is a known addictive substance; this could account for the addictive potential of carisoprodol (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration).

It is slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol, chloroform and acetone. The drug&#x27;s solubility is practically independent of pH.

== History ==
In June 1959, several American pharmacologists convened at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan to discuss a newly discovered structural analogue of meprobamate. The substitution of one hydrogen atom with an isopropyl group on one of the carbamyl nitrogens was intended to yield a drug with new pharmacological properties. It had been developed by Frank Berger at Wallace Laboratories and was named carisoprodol.

Building on meprobamate&#x27;s pharmacological effects, carisoprodol was intended to have better muscle relaxing properties, less potential for addiction, and a lower risk of overdose. Carisoprodol&#x27;s effect profile did indeed turn out to differ significantly with respect to meprobamate, with carisoprodol possessing stronger muscle relaxant and analgesic effects.

== Usage and legal status ==

=== Norway ===
Reports from Norway have shown carisoprodol has addictive potential as a prodrug of meprobamate and/or potentiator of hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, and similar drugs. In May 2008 it was taken off the market in Norway.

=== European Union ===
In the EU, the European Medicines Agency issued a release recommending member states suspend marketing authorization for this product in the treatment of acute (not chronic) back pain.

As of November 2007, carisoprodol has been taken off the market in Sweden due to problems with dependence and side effects. The agency overseeing pharmaceuticals considered other drugs used with the same indications as carisoprodol to have the same or better effects without the risks of the drug.

=== United States ===
In December 2011, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued the final ruling placing carisoprodol on Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The placement of carisoprodol on Schedule IV was effective in January 2012.

=== Canada ===
Federally, carisoprodol is a prescription drug (Schedule I, sub-schedule F1). Provincial regulations vary. It is no longer readily available.

=== Indonesia ===
* In September 2013, carisoprodol was taken off the market due to problems with diversion, dependence and side effects.
* In September 2017, one child died and 50 had seizures when PCC, which stands for &quot;Paracetamol Caffeine Carisoprodol&quot; was mixed (probably illicit) into children&#x27;s drinks in elementary and junior high schools in Kendari.

<text>Lars Engqvist (born 13 August 1945) is a Swedish politician. He served as chairman of the youth organization of the Swedish Social Democrats from 1972 to 1978, and then worked as a journalist. He was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Arbetet&quot;, a Malmö-based newspaper. In the early 1990s he was the mayor of Malmö, and then president of the Swedish Film Institute before receiving his first government appointment in 1998.

On 1 June 2004 he was appointed deputy Prime Minister of the Swedish government. The appointment was mainly to make him the acting prime minister under Göran Persson, when the latter received knee surgery in early June. The appointment would not affect his status as the Minister of Health and Social Affairs. However, at the same time it was also announced that Engqvist would step down from his government posts on 1 October, to become the new Governor of Jönköping County.

In April 2005 he was appointed chairman of the Swedish public service television company Sveriges Television, succeeding Allan Larsson. The appointment drew criticism because of his close ties to the Social Democratic Party and the government.

<text>The University of Gloucestershire is a public university based in Gloucestershire, England. It is located over five campuses, three in Cheltenham and two in Gloucester. 

The university is the successor of a large number of merged, name-changed and reformed institutions of further and higher education. Its history spans nearly two centuries. The University was established through two distinct strands of educational provision in Gloucestershire, being that provided by Local Government and that founded by the Anglican Church. The university can trace its earliest history to the Mechanics Institutes of Cheltenham (1834) and Gloucester (1840), and the Cheltenham Training College, which was established in 1847 by the Reverend Francis Close. In 1921, the Cheltenham Training College separated into two schools, St Paul&#x27;s College of Education and St Mary&#x27;s College of Education, which eventually merged in 1979. The College of St Paul &amp; St Mary went on to combine with the Gloucestershire College of Arts &amp; Technology in 1990, forming the . In October 2001, the college was awarded university status.

The university provides almost 100 undergraduate courses and around 57 taught post-graduate courses within eight schools.

A 10-year memorandum of understanding exists between the university, Gloucestershire College and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College to support access to higher education.

==History==

=== Predecessor colleges and institutes ===

The following are points in the university&#x27;s history appearing in the timeline.
* 1834 – Cheltenham Mechanics&#x27; Institute
* 1840 – Gloucester Mechanics&#x27; Institute
* 1847 – Cheltenham Training College (Church Foundation)
* 1852 – Cheltenham School of Art
* 1920 – St Paul&#x27;s College of Education
* 1920 – St Mary&#x27;s College of Education
* 1967 – Gloucestershire College of Education
* 1979 – College of St Paul and St Mary
* 1980 – Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology from four other Local Authority colleges
* 1990 – Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology (HE)
* 1990 – Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education
* 2001 – University of Gloucestershire

From 1992, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education (CGCHE) was permitted to award first and postgraduate degrees, and in 1998 it achieved research degree-awarding powers. In 2001, the University of Gloucestershire was awarded university status.

====Mechanics&#x27; Institutes====
Mechanics&#x27; Institutes developed in the United Kingdom over the 19th century. A number formed the earliest roots of Universities and Colleges. The Cheltenham Mechanics Institute is associated with a notable historical incident. A speaker, George Holyoake, became the last person prosecuted and convicted for blasphemy following a public lecture he delivered at the institute in April 1842.

====Anglican Foundation====
The Anglican Foundation of the University of Gloucestershire evolved from the Christian Foundation of the former colleges of St. Mary and St. Paul, merged as the College of St Paul and St Mary which united with the higher education courses of the Gloucestershire College of Arts &amp; Technology subsequently to create the university. Until September 2011, Foundation Fellows played a significant role in the governance of the university. Following a review of governance by the university in 2010/11, it was agreed that council should be responsible for appointing all its external members. Foundation Fellows are still eligible to apply to council to become external members.

===2001-present day===
In February 2012 Rennie Fritchie was announced as the new chancellor succeeding Lord Carey of Clifton, the former Archbishop of Canterbury. In late 2023, she was then succeeded by Michael Bichard, Baron Bichard, who currently holds the position. The Bishop of Gloucester Rachel Treweek serves as pro-chancellor. As of August 2023, Clare Kelly Marchant (born ) holds the post of vice-chancellor. Marchant was awarded a damehood for services to higher education in the 2024 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

====2009–2011====
In 2009–2010 several formerly senior figures in the university resigned. In November 2009, Paul Bowler, the deputy vice-chancellor, resigned shortly after being suspended from his post only seven months after joining the institution. Paul Bowler, a former investment banker who joined Gloucestershire in May 2009, was on a week&#x27;s leave when he was told not to return to work. On 7 December, a university spokesperson said, &quot;The deputy vice-chancellor Paul Bowler, has resigned. Financial benefits have not been sought by Mr Bowler, who is leaving of his own accord to pursue other interests&quot;.

In December 2009 Dr. Sharp, dean and associate pro vice-chancellor, following his resignation, took up a post in the new UK Higher Education International Unit.

The vice-chancellor, Patricia Broadfoot, resigned in March 2010, during conflicting views on the financial health of the institution. The precise circumstances of this resignation and the salary paid to her as recorded in the public accounts have attracted various media attention being the reported highest of all UK vice-chancellors for the year.

In May 2010, the chancellor, Lord Carey, resigned.

In September 2010, Paul Bowler was a witness in an employment tribunal case brought by a member of staff of the university under the &#x27;whistleblowing&#x27; legislation – the Public Interest Disclosure Act. The tribunal found for the complainant and outcome was reported in the higher education press.

In March 2011, Paul Hartley resigned.

====2012 onwards====

Stephen Marston, former vice-chancellor, has committed himself to listening to staff concerns. He states &#x27;new culture&#x27; being addressed and reports a new senior management human resources appointment.

Since his appointment the university has been nominated for several awards for student support, including the Times Higher Leadership and Management awards for outstanding student services in 2014 and 2015, and Outstanding Student Support by WhatUni.

In 2015 applications rose by 6%, and the numbers confirming offers of places had increased by 18% when the official UCAS deadline passed.

==Campuses==
The university has three campuses located in Cheltenham and Gloucester.

===The Park===
The Park, Cheltenham, is the largest of the campuses and is the administrative centre. It is located in the Park district of Cheltenham. The estate dates from the 19th century and was originally designed as zoological, botanical and horticultural gardens.

The Media School was relocated to the Park Campus in 2011 from the former Pittville campus. The new facilities include a newsroom, television &amp; radio studios, edit suites, and teaching facilities. It has been awarded Skillset Media Academy status and is part of the North by Southwest – The Gloucestershire and Wiltshire Skillset Media Academy Partnership.

Student accommodation is available in the Park villas, Challinor, Eldon &amp; Merrowdown and Eldon &amp; Merrowdown Annexe located on and next to the campus, as well as Spa Court and Regency Halls across the town of Cheltenham.
A partnership with the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust was launched in May 2009 and the Park Campus grounds became designated as a community green space. The garden includes over 900 trees, both native and ornamental, a shallow lake and a meadow with native species.

===Francis Close Hall===
Francis Close Hall site includes restored historic buildings close to Cheltenham&#x27;s town centre. The campus can trace its history back to the Cheltenham Training College founded by the Rev. Francis Close in 1847.

The campus is also home to the university&#x27;s Special Collections and Archives service, the official repository for the historic records of the university and predecessor institutions. It contains several special collections relating to Gloucestershire and beyond. The department is custodian of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society Library, and curates and maintains the Gloucestershire Poets, Writers and Artists Collection, which includes works and artefacts relating to the Dymock Poets, Whittington Press, U A Fanthorpe, Michael Henry, James Elroy Flecker and the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail. Other collections include the Local Heritage Initiative Archive. The service is open to staff, students and the public.

The campus has a mix of humanities, education, natural &amp; social science and creative arts, the latter housed in open-plan illustration and landscape architecture studios, with VR technology, 3D printers and model making workshops.

Student accommodation is available in Shaftesbury Hall (on campus), Hardwick Halls and Pittville Student Village. Further accommodation includes St George&#x27;s, St Mary&#x27;s, Maidenhorn and Whitehart.

===The Centre for Fashion, Art and Photography===
The Hardwick Centre for Fashion, Art and Photography opened in 2011 and is in close proximity to Francis Close Hall. The purpose-built studios cater for students studying a mixture of creative subjects including its Fine Art (undergraduate and postgraduate), Photography and Fashion degrees. There is a gallery for public exhibitions. It has recently been renamed as The Centre for Fashion, Art and Photography.

===Oxstalls===
The campus is located in Gloucester and re-opened in 2002. It was closed in August 1993. Following protests about the removal of higher education from the city, a solution was reached with Gloucester City Council. The campus site is from a predecessor college.

<doc id="703663" wikidata="Q4999126" url="?curid=703663" title="Burleith">
<text>Burleith is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., United States. It is bordered by 35th Street NW to the east, Reservoir Road NW and the historic Georgetown district to the south, Whitehaven Park to the north, and Glover Archbold Park to the west. The neighborhood is home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and the Washington International School (primary campus).

==History==

The history of Burleith can be traced back to 1886, when the Huidekoper family came into ownership of the Burleith tract of land. During their tenure as residents, they built a few buildings, but kept most of the land as woods and fields. In 1922 the Huidekopers sold the land to Shannon and Luchs, Inc. Instead of keeping the land in its natural state like the previous owners, Shannon and Luchs decided to hire an architect to develop the area. The architect designed homes with moderate prices between $8,950-$13,500 that were targeted for middle class residents with &quot;moderate income, but above average taste&quot;.

==Burleith Citizens Association==
In 1925 the Burleith Citizens Association was developed to deal with civic and social issues concerning the neighborhood. Issues have included parking, noise control, traffic lights, and the relationship with neighboring Georgetown University. The Association also plans social activities, such as picnics and children events. Burleith is in Ward 2 and belongs to ANC 2E along with Georgetown and Hillandale.

==Hillandale==
To the west of Burleith is a 24-hour gated community called Hillandale; some consider this a separate neighborhood but it is technically part of Burleith. Residents of Hillandale have included U.S. Senators Joseph Lieberman (I-Connecticut) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia. Prior to 1979, Hillandale was an estate owned by John Dustin Archbold&#x27;s family.

<text>The Sharp Aquos is a product brand name for LCD televisions, component screens, tablets and smartphones, originally sold by Sharp Corporation of Japan and also used by licensees.

== History ==
It encompasses small, portable models (e.g. the 13&quot; B series) up to large home-theater screens (e.g. 65&quot; high-definition widescreen models), as well as component screens for portable devices including mobile phones. Aquos was first released in 2001 with 13&quot;, 15&quot;, and 20&quot; 4:3 sizes starting, pricing at $1,799.99, $2,999.99, and $4,999.99 respectively. Since then, the Aquos brand is Sharp&#x27;s premium LCD line (as Sharp also makes non-Aquos LCD TVs that sell for less), and recently they have been the first series of LCD HDTVs to feature integrated Blu-ray Disc players with the BD-60U and BD-80U series debuting in 2009. Some Aquos LCD TVs are notable for displaying color in a RYGB color space known as Quattron, which adds a yellow component, as opposed to the standard RGB color space used by most color televisions.

Aquos televisions run a Linux-based operating system. Sharp&#x27;s SmartLink technology was incorporated into the Aquos LC-15L1U-S.

From 2015 to 2018, Sharp-branded TVs sold in the United States were made by Chinese manufacturer Hisense. In 2019, Sharp regained its licensing and brand, buying back its assets from Hisense. Sharp-manufactured Sharp TVs have been back on the market since late 2019.

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
In 2015, Sharp&#x27;s North America TV business was sold to China based Hisense, allowing them to sell TVs in the United States. The intention to acquire was announced in July 2015. Sharp Corporation was subsequently acquired by Taiwan based Foxconn in August, 2016. In 2017, the new owner of Sharp, Foxconn filed a lawsuit against Hisense concerning quality of TVs sold under its Sharp branding citing the TVs &quot;violate FCC rules on electromagnetic interference emissions, and [...] Hisense gave consumers deceptive information about picture size, brightness levels and the 4K resolution.&quot; This lawsuit was dropped in early 2018.

Between 2015 and 2018, all Sharp brand TVs sold in the United States were made by Chinese manufacturing company Hisense. As of late 2019, Sharp Corporation has regained the license from Hisense and now continue making Sharp branded TVs.

<doc id="703683" wikidata="Q1174600" url="?curid=703683" title="David Gregory (mathematician)">
<text>David Gregory (originally spelt Gregorie) FRS (3 June 1659 – 10 October 1708) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer. He was professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, and later Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, and a proponent of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;.

==Biography==
The fourth of the fifteen children of David Gregorie, a doctor from Kinnairdy, Banffshire, and Jean Walker of Orchiston, David was born in Upper Kirkgate, Aberdeen. The nephew of astronomer and mathematician James Gregory, David, like his influential uncle before him, studied at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College (University of Aberdeen), from 1671 to 1675. The Gregorys were Jacobites and left Scotland to escape religious discrimination. Young David visited several countries on the continent, including the Netherlands (where he began studying medicine at Leiden University) and France, and did not return to Scotland until 1683.

On 28 November 1683, Gregory graduated M.A. at University of Edinburgh, and in October 1683 he became Chair of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh. He was &quot;the first to openly teach the doctrines of the &quot;Principia&quot;, in a public seminary...in those days this was a daring innovation.&quot;

Gregory decided to leave for England where, in 1691, he was elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy at the University of Oxford, due in large part to the influence of Isaac Newton. The same year he was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1692, he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.

Gregory spent several days with Isaac Newton in 1694, discussing revisions for a second edition of Newton&#x27;s Principia. Gregory made notes of these discussions, but the second edition of 1713 was not due to Gregory.

In 1695 he published &quot;Catoptricae et dioptricae sphaericae elementa&quot; which addressed chromatic aberration and the possibility of its correction with achromatic lens.

In 1705 Gregory became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. At the Union of 1707, he was given the responsibility of re-organising the Scottish Mint. He was an uncle of philosopher Thomas Reid.

Gregory and his wife, Elizabeth Oliphant, had nine children, but seven died while still children.

On his death in Maidenhead, Berkshire he was buried in Maidenhead churchyard.

<doc id="703687" wikidata="Q1124875" url="?curid=703687" title="Monster's Ball">
<text>Monster&#x27;s Ball is a 2001 American romantic drama film directed by Marc Forster, produced by Lee Daniels and written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who also appeared in the film. It stars Billy Bob Thornton, Heath Ledger, Halle Berry, and Peter Boyle, with Sean Combs, Mos Def, and Coronji Calhoun in supporting roles.

Thornton portrays a corrections officer who begins a relationship with a woman (Berry), unaware that she is the widow of a man (Combs) he assisted in executing. Principal photography began in May 2001 in New Orleans, Louisiana and lasted for five weeks.

&quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; premiered at AFI Fest on November 11, 2001, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 8, 2002, by Lionsgate Films. The film received positive reviews, with critical acclaim directed at Berry&#x27;s, Ledger&#x27;s and Thornton&#x27;s performances, Forster&#x27;s direction, and Addica and Rokos&#x27; screenplay. It was also a significant commercial success, grossing $45 million worldwide on a production budget of $4 million.

The film received numerous accolades and nominations, and was nominated twice at the 74th Academy Awards for Best Actress (Berry) and Original Screenplay (Addica and Rokos), with Berry winning for her performance, becoming the first African-American woman to win the award.

==Plot==

Hank Grotowski, a widower, and his son, Sonny, are correction officers in a Georgia prison. They reside with Hank&#x27;s father, Buck, an ailing, bigoted retired correction officer whose wife died by suicide. When Willie and Darryl Cooper, friends of Sonny&#x27;s who are Black come by the house, Hank frightens them off with a shotgun at the behest of Buck.

Hank, the prison&#x27;s deputy warden, is to oversee the execution of convicted murderer Lawrence Musgrove. Musgrove is visited by his wife Leticia and son Tyrell before his execution. While at home, overwhelmed by her husband&#x27;s impending death as well as numerous personal and financial difficulties, Leticia lashes out at her son for his obesity, resorting to physical and emotional abuse. The night before the execution, Hank tells Sonny that a &quot;monster&#x27;s ball&quot; is held by the correction officers, a get-together of those who will participate in the execution. While Musgrove waits to be taken, he draws a sketch of Sonny and Hank. The proceedings prove too much for Sonny, who, as he is leading Lawrence to the electric chair, vomits, and then collapses. Following the execution, Hank confronts Sonny in the prison&#x27;s bathroom and assaults him for ruining Musgrove&#x27;s last walk.

The next morning, Hank attacks Sonny in his bed and orders him to leave the house. Sonny grabs a revolver from under his pillow and holds his father at gunpoint. The confrontation ends in their living room with Sonny asking his father if he hates him. After Hank confirms that he does and always has, Sonny takes his own life by shooting himself in the chest. A shocked, ashamed, and devastated Hank buries Sonny in the back garden. He subsequently resigns as deputy warden, burns his uniform in the backyard, and locks the door of Sonny&#x27;s room. He later purchases a local gas station in an attempt to provide a distraction in his retirement. The Coopers offer condolences to Hank, which he accepts.

One rainy night, Hank is driving and sees Tyrell lying on the ground by the side of the road, with Leticia calling for help. After some hesitation, Hank stops. On being told Tyrell was struck by a car, he drives them to a hospital, where Tyrell dies from his injuries. At the suggestion of the authorities at the hospital, Hank drives Leticia home. A few days later, Hank gives Leticia a ride home from the diner where she works. They begin talking in the car about their common losses, and she invites him in. Hank finds out that Leticia is Lawrence&#x27;s widow, though he does not tell her that he participated in her husband&#x27;s execution. They drown their grief with alcohol and have sex.

Hank eventually offers to give Leticia Sonny&#x27;s truck which had been fixed up by the Coopers and their father Ryrus. She finally accepts after initial discomfort. When Leticia stops by Hank&#x27;s home with a present for him, she meets Buck who insults her and implies that Hank is only involved with her because he enjoys sex with black women. Leticia, offended by the remarks, refuses to interact with Hank. After Hank is made aware of Buck&#x27;s actions, he finally stands up to his father and commits him to a nursing home. He then renames the gas station &quot;Leticia&#x27;s&quot;, and when asked he replies that it is his girlfriend&#x27;s name.

Leticia is evicted from her home and Hank invites her to move in with him. While he is out, she discovers Lawrence&#x27;s drawings of Sonny and Hank, discovering Hank&#x27;s involvement in her husband&#x27;s death. She is horrified at first by the revelation but, numbed by her suffering and realizing the execution was obviously legal since Lawrence likely committed murder, she stays. The film ends with the two of them eating ice cream together on the back porch as Hank states that he thinks they&#x27;ll be okay.

==Production==
===Development===

The basis for this film came from the desire of actors-turned-writers Addica and Rokos to make a script that would interest a big star alongside themselves with Harvey Keitel in mind since he liked the latter&#x27;s writing when offered one of their scripts. They were inspired by their troubled relationships with their fathers as a starting point that eventually led to a generational tale about executioners, which eventually led to the inspiration for the title (an old term for the last meal of a condemned man and a &quot;ball&quot; that took place with his jailers the night before). They wrote the script over a period of eight months in 1995, which led to some interest from a producer of a film Rokos had previously acted in. Years of development occurred due to interest from filmmakers ranging from Robert De Niro to Oliver Stone along with studios that wanted a lighter ending, but the transition to Lee Daniels and Lionsgate led to interest back to the original ending. The film was produced by Lionsgate and Lee Daniels Entertainment, the first production for the latter. Before Halle Berry was cast as Leticia, Angela Bassett and Vanessa Williams were first cast, but both of them declined. Wes Bentley turned down the part of Sonny, which eventually went to Heath Ledger.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began in May 2001 in New Orleans, Louisiana and lasted for five weeks. A week before production, Sean Combs auditioned for the role of Lawrence Musgrove, and won it. At one point, the production moved to the fields, cellblocks and death houses of Louisiana State Penitentiary for a week to shoot prison interiors and exteriors, with some scenes shot in actual death chambers.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 142 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Somber and thought provoking, &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; has great performances all around.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and rated it as the best film of 2001, stating that it &quot;has the complexity of great fiction&quot;. Ebert also praised the performances of Berry and Thornton, saying, &quot;[Thornton] and [Berry] star as Hank and Leticia, in two performances that are so powerful because they observe the specific natures of these two characters, and avoid the pitfalls of racial cliches. What a shock to find these two characters freed from the conventions of political correctness, and allowed to be who they are: weak, flawed, needful, with good hearts tested by lifetimes of compromise.&quot; Of the screenplay, Ebert wrote, &quot;The screenplay by [Addica] and [Rokos] is subtle and observant; one is reminded of short fiction by Andre Dubus, William Trevor, Eudora Welty, Raymond Carver. It specifically does not tell &quot;their&quot; story, but focuses on two separate lives. The characters are given equal weight, and have individual story arcs, which do not intersect but simply, inevitably, meet.&quot;

Ben Falk of BBC.com spoke highly of Berry and Thornton&#x27;s performances, writing, &quot;This is by far Berry&#x27;s best-ever performance and Thornton reminds us that there are few, if any, leading men who can convey sadness and hope almost simultaneously in just one minimal glance.&quot;

<text>The University of Huddersfield is a public research university located in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. It has been a University since 1992, but has its origins in a series of institutions dating back to the 19th century. It has made teaching quality a particular focus of its activities, winning the inaugural Higher Education Academy Global Teaching Excellence Award in 2017, and achieving a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) Gold Award, in 2017 and 2023. The university has also put an increasing focus on research quality, and as of 2022 more than three quarters of its academic staff hold a doctorate, the third highest rate in England.

Its chancellor George W. Buckley, a graduate of the university and a former CEO of 3M, was appointed in 2020.

== History ==
The present University of Huddersfield can trace its history back through several predecessor institutions.

=== An early false start (1825) ===
In 1825 there was an attempt to set up a Scientific and Mechanics Institution in the town. Supported by a group of donors, its patron was leading Whig and large local landowner Sir John Ramsden. Its aims were to instruct local mechanics and tradesmen in scientific principles relating to their work, through lectures and a circulation library, which by 1827 contained over 700 volumes. The financial crisis of 1825–1826 led to the failure of the institution’s bankers, and it faltered and later became part of the Huddersfield Philosophical Society, an organisation with which its rules now more closely aligned. Some 19th-century students earned qualifications as external students of the University of London.

=== Young Men&#x27;s Mental Improvement Society (1841–1843) ===
The history of the university is usually traced to 1841. It was in that year that five young men who were employed by local industrialist Frederic Schwann, who had been born in Frankfurt, approached their employer for support in establishing a new subscription library and some elementary educational classes, ‘to supply in some cases the deficiency of early instruction, and to procure for others the means of further improvement’. They first met in the Temperance Hotel, Cross Church Street, Huddersfield in May 1841. Classes began for the first 40 or so pupils in the room of the British School at Outcote Bank, and were taught by experienced staff from the local Collegiate Schools and businessmen like Schwann. A subscription library was founded, and classes were delivered in Reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, design and French.

===Huddersfield Mechanics&#x27; Institution (1844–1883)===
The increase in student numbers prompted a move to Nelson&#x27;s Buildings in New Street, and the renaming of the institution to more closely reflect its remit. The first Secretary, Robert Neil, was appointed in 1844, and acted not just as a Secretary but as a teacher-supervisor, influencing the formative development of the organisation. In March 1844 he organised a Soiree (tea party) for 700 at the town&#x27;s Philosophical Hall, and in May a Rural Gala for 500 at Fixby Pastures. Negotiations with the local railway company led to reduced fares into York for 300 membership to enjoy the cultural opportunities of the city. In 1846, Neil was succeeded by George Searle Phillips, who was described by historian John O&#x27;Connell as &#x27;philosopher, propagandist and missionary&#x27; of the institution. He oversaw expansion of the curriculum, revision of the fee system to make the institution self-supporting, the visitation of absent students and the compilation of statistics of the institution&#x27;s achievements.

In 1850, growing attendance meant another move, to Wellington Buildings, Queen Street. At this time, a &#x27;Preliminary Savings Bank&#x27; scheme was also introduced in the Institution, linked to the Huddersfield Banking Company, which took almost 7000 deposits during its first year of operation. Based on the Scottish system of encouraging working people to make small, regular saving deposits, it was a forerunner of the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. In 1854, after Phillips resignation, Frank Curzon took over as Secretary and remained in post until 1883. During his tenure a prize giving and distribution ceremony was introduced to reward attendance and good conduct. He not only oversaw a recruitment drive, but also the move to the first purpose built home of the institution, on Northumberland Street. The institution took possession in 1861, as student numbers passed 800 annually.

The continued prosperity of the institution during the 1860s has been attributed to two main developments – the demand for more technical and scientific education, and the introduction of an examination system by the newly formed national Department of Science and Art. The institution managed an examinations system and gave grants to science schools (often based in Mechanics&#x27; Institutions) on a &#x27;payment by results&#x27; basis. In 1857 the Society of Arts held its first examinations outside London at Huddersfield.

=== Technical School and Mechanics&#x27; Institute (1883–1896) ===
A merger took place with the town’s Female Educational Institute in 1883, and the institution become the Technical School and Mechanics&#x27; Institute. A new building was constructed on what it today the ring road called Queensgate that cost £20,000, and was funded by the subscriptions of members and philanthropic supporters. Called the Ramsden Building, after the Ramsden family who owned the land upon which the building stood, the building is still in use by the Health and Human Sciences Department of the university today. Before the building opened to students in 1884, it was used for a five-month Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition. These kinds of exhibitions, inspired by the Great Exhibition, showcased the latest in textile technology alongside copies of great masters paintings or more contemporary works.

=== Technical College and College of Technology (1896–1970) ===
In 1896, the Technical School and Mechanics&#x27; Institute became the Technical College, which changed its name in 1958 to become the College of Technology.

World War I was a time of growth for the College. A Coal Tar Chemistry Department was created, funded by the government and by donations which were also used to provide research scholarships in Chemistry. More than 100 chemists worked at the College as research staff as products were created for British Dyes Ltd.

During World War II, the College housed student teachers evacuated from Avery Hill College of Education, Eltham, London (now part of the University of Greenwich), and trained members of the armed forces training to be radio mechanics, engineers, fitters and clerks. Civilians also trained at the College in more basic workshop skills.

One notable visitor to the college in 1964 was Dusty Springfield, who appeared at &#x27;Sound Sixty-Four&#x27;, an event organised by the Huddersfield Tech students as part of Rag Week.

=== Huddersfield Polytechnic (1970–1992) ===
It was the College of Technology which, in 1970, merged with the Oastler College of Education to become Huddersfield Polytechnic. The Oastler College had been founded in 1963, as a day training college for school teachers. Huddersfield Polytechnic was officially inaugurated by the then Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher on 23 April 1971.

In 1974, a further merger took place with the Technical Teaching Training College at Holly Bank. That college had been noted in education circles for its policy of training students over the age of 25, one of whom was the future Education Secretary David Blunkett. However, after the merger, it became part of the Polytechnic&#x27;s Faculty of Education, and those idiosyncrasies were gradually eroded. Teacher training remained on the Holly Bank site until the land was sold by the university in 2001.

The campus precinct was redeveloped by the firm Wilson and Womersley. Awarding J. L. Womersley a Fellowship for the design, the Deputy Rector commented on the courage and vision of the plan, with the Central Services building in particular being a monument to that vision. The large brown Central Services Building, now known as the Schwann Building, a prominent feature not just of the campus but also the town of Huddersfield itself, was completed in January 1977. The brown colour was chosen so it would better fit in with the local sandstone. The building was officially opened by the Duchess of Kent.

Several high-profile bands played the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including The Stranglers, The Jam and The Undertones.

Former Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned to his hometown in 1983, the same year he stood down as an MP, to open a university building on Firth Street and to deliver a lecture. He would later have a different building named after him on the campus. An annual memorial lecture takes place at the university in his name, and notable speakers have included former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown in 2018 and Sir John Major in 2022.

=== University of Huddersfield (since 1992) ===
The Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield in 1992.

Professor Ken Durrands was Vice-Chancellor at the time the institution achieved university status. He was later credited with having &quot;transformed&quot; it into &quot;a thriving university&quot;. However, in 1994 he was forced to leave his post before the end of his contract, following a row over the removal of independently-elected representatives from the university&#x27;s governing body.

Sir William Taylor served as Vice-Chancellor for a year during 1994 and 1995. He had previously been the Vice-Chancellor of Hull University. He only intended to remain at Huddersfield for 12 months, on an interim basis.

The next Vice-Chancellor was John Tarrant, appointed in October 1995. He served in the role until 2006, and was later Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities until his retirement in 2010.
The present Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bob Cryan, himself from the Deighton area of Huddersfield, took over the job in January 2007. At the time, he was the youngest Vice-Chancellor in the UK. His strategy for the university during this time has been to lead an &quot;inspiring, innovative University of international renown&quot;. An engineer by background, Professor Cryan became the President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology in 2023.

In May 2007, the university welcomed Queen Elizabeth for a visit to the campus, during which she unveiled the foundation stone for the new Creative Arts Building. The following year, the building was officially opened by the Duke of Kent. The university is closely associated with annual events, including the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and Huddersfield Literature Festival, both of which are partly hosted at university venues.

In 2013, the University of Huddersfield was named University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards. Accepting the award, Professor Cryan said: &quot;It is a tribute to all the staff who have worked so hard to get us where we are today. We are now well established as one of the country’s innovative universities – and the best is yet to come.&quot;

The university attracts students from more than 130 countries. With an annual turnover of approximately £150 million each year, it estimates it is worth £300 million annually to the local economy.

The university came under scrutiny in July 2020 for the provision of training at a Bahraini centre accused of facilitating state-sponsored torture.

In 2021, the university&#x27;s chancellor George W. Buckley, lent his name to a new Leadership Centre at the university, aimed at supporting future managers and leaders.

== Campuses ==

=== Queensgate Campus ===
 The university&#x27;s main campus, Queensgate, is south-east of Huddersfield town centre. Virtually all of the university&#x27;s teaching takes place on the site. The campus is split in two by the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. It features a mixture of converted mill buildings, and purpose-built facilities. More than £250 million has been invested by the university in the campus.

A notable feature of the University of Huddersfield in recent years has been the amount of building work taking place on the Queensgate campus. The Creative Arts Building opened in 2008, and it has since been adorned by a large piece of public art in the form of the poem Let There Be Peace, by Lemn Sissay. The new £17 million Business School opened in 2010, followed by the £3 million Buckley Innovation Centre in 2012, the £22.5 million Student Central building in 2014, and the £27.5 million Oastler Building for Law and the School of Music, Humanities and Media, in 2017. Redevelopments of existing buildings include the creation of the £1 million Holocaust Centre, opened in 2018, now known as Holocaust Centre North.

As part of the university&#x27;s 175th anniversary commemorations in 2016, several of the buildings on the Queensgate campus were renamed after significant figures with connections to the Huddersfield area and the university&#x27;s predecessor institutions. The distinctive brown Central Services Building was renamed the Schwann Building, after Frederic and Mary Schwann who had been inspired to create the Young Men&#x27;s Mental Improvement Society in 1841. Other buildings were named for Edith Key, Joseph Priestley, the Brontë sisters and the university&#x27;s own chancellor emeritus, Sir Patrick Stewart.

In a second round of renaming in 2017, other campus buildings were named in honour of Karen Sparck Jones, Dame Caroline Haslett, Sir John Cockcroft, and Charles Sikes.

The university&#x27;s latest major building project, the Barbara Hepworth Building, is home to teaching across subjects in art, design and architecture. It was completed in summer 2019.

Next, the university plans to build a Health Innovation Campus, at the nearby Southgate site. The area had been derelict since the demolition of the old Huddersfield Sports Centre. The proposals were approved by Kirklees Council in 2020 and form part of the broader Huddersfield Blueprint project under which a series of redevelopment schemes are taking place throughout the town.

In 2021, the Yorkshire Film and Television School was launched at the university. It features a custom-built film studio facility on Firth Street in Huddersfield, on the edge of the campus. It has been named the Stewart Film Studio, after the university&#x27;s chancellor emeritus Sir Patrick Stewart.

In 2022, the newly renovated Technology Building was renamed in honour of Laura Annie Willson.

=== University Campus Oldham ===
University Campus Oldham (UCO), located in Oldham, Greater Manchester, opened in May 2005. It offers full and part-time courses at degree, diploma, foundation degree and postgraduate level. Since August 2012 University Campus Oldham (UCO) has been managed by Oldham College. UCO Teacher Education programmes have continued to be validated by the university, and lead to a University of Huddersfield award.

=== University Campus Barnsley ===
University Campus Barnsley, located in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, opened in 2005. The campus offers facilities for subjects such as music, art and design, journalism and media production. £5.5 million has been invested with the help of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, Yorkshire Forward and Objective 1.

From August 2013 University Campus Barnsley (UCB) has been managed by Barnsley College. UCB programmes starting in September 2013 continue to be validated by the university, and lead to a University of Huddersfield award.

Previously the Barnsley Mining and Technical College was at this site. The “Tech” opened in 1932 when mining was at the heart of Barnsley’s economy and the College was supposedly the largest mining college in the world.

=== International Study Centre ===
The International Study Centre (ISC) at the university offers degree preparation courses for international students. The programmes are run by Study Group. The ISC is located on the university’s main Queensgate campus. Students can mix with others and also have access to the library and other specialist IT facilities.

== Organisation and governance==
=== Chancellor ===
The university&#x27;s first two chancellors were Reginald Cross, who held the role between 1992 and 1994, and Sir Ernest Hall, who served between 1996 and 2004.
Sir Patrick Stewart served as chancellor for 11 years, having first been appointed in 2004. He has been a regular visitor to the campus, sometimes leading workshops with drama students, in addition to being an overseas ambassador for the university. One feature of Sir Patrick&#x27;s tenure as chancellor was his attendance at summer graduation ceremonies, and his leading of parades of graduates through the town. The first such parade took place in 2008. He has continued his association with the university as emeritus chancellor. In 2016, the building used by the university&#x27;s Drama department, previously known as the Milton building, was renamed the Sir Patrick Stewart building. He returned to the campus to reopen it.

Prince Andrew, Duke of York replaced Sir Patrick Stewart to become the university’s fourth chancellor in July 2015. He had previously served as the patron of the university since 2013. In 2013 he opened the university&#x27;s centre for young entrepreneurs situated in the Buckley Innovation Centre. He resigned in 2019 following a &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview concerned with his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and amid student protests against him; the student union had called for his resignation and issued a statement that the university&#x27;s chancellor was &quot;a man with ties to organised child sexual exploitation and assault.&quot;

Since 2020, the chancellor has been businessman and graduate of the university, George W. Buckley.

=== Senior management ===
The university is run by the vice-chancellor, Professor Bob Cryan. Underneath him is deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Tim Thornton, and three pro vice-chancellors. Each of the five academic schools is led by a dean, with a seventh dean who oversees the graduate school. The university previously had seven schools, but the former schools of Art, Design and Architecture and Music, Humanities and Media merged in 2021 to form the school of Arts and Humanities. Other university services are run by directors.

==Academic profile==

=== Academic schools ===

The university is organised into the following academic schools:
* Applied Sciences
* Arts and Humanities
* Computing and Engineering
* School of Business, Education and Law
* Human and Health Sciences

===Research ===
The university has world-leading applied research groups in biomedical sciences, engineering and physical sciences, social sciences and arts and humanities. It has quadrupled its research income and its number of postgraduate researchers in recent years.

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise, the University of Huddersfield achieved its best ever result. It rose to 68th in the UK Research Power league table, having been placed 97th in the 2008 REF. More University of Huddersfield academics, 262, were entered than in any previous cycle, and the proportion of world leading research submitted increased to 15%.

The 2021 REF allowed the university to further develop its performance, submitting 589 academic staff. It is now placed in the top third of all UK institutions on the measurement of &#x27;research power&#x27;.

The university also host the MIAMI facilities, a world-class laboratory addressed to materials sciences investigations and energy studies.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
It was ranked 701+ in the 2015–16 QS World University Rankings. The university was the Entrepreneurial University of the Year at the &quot;THE awards&quot; 2012. It won the Outstanding Registry Team 2013 at the &quot;THE Leadership and Management&quot; awards 2013. The university was University of the Year at the &quot;THE awards&quot; 2013. In 2014 the university was named the Times Higher Education&#x27;s (THE) Best University Workplace. The university was the &quot;New University of the Year at the Educate North Awards&quot; 2015. The university has also been ranked as 20th place on the QS World University Rankings for the subject of Music, being the highest ranked non-conservatoire university in Britain on the list.

The university has a policy of ensuring all academic staff have, or are working towards, a teaching qualification. In 2016, the university came top among all UK universities for having qualified teaching staff. More than 90% of its academics were found to have a teaching qualification, with the next-highest institution scoring 84%. By 2020, the university remained joint top among English universities.

==Heritage Quay== 

The university&#x27;s archive collection is named Heritage Quay and housed in the Schwann building on the Queensgate Campus. It holds the archives of all the university&#x27;s predecessor institutions. Heritage Quay opened in 2014 and is open to the general public, allowing easier access to both students and non-students to the many collections within the university&#x27;s archives. It received more than £1.5 million in Lottery funding, and in 2016 won the Buildings That Inspire category in The Guardian&#x27;s University Awards. Heritage Quay is home to the archive of the Rugby Football League. The university has been partnering with the RFL and Kirklees Council as part of a project to turn the historic George Hotel in Huddersfield into a national museum of rugby league although the project has been thrown into some doubt by the council&#x27;s desire to house the museum at a different location in the town. Heritage Quay&#x27;s collections focus on &quot;education, British 20th/21st century music, sport, politics, theatre, and art and design&quot;. In 2023, it became the new home of brass band history.

==Student life==

=== Accommodation ===
The Storthes Hall Park Student Village and Ashenhurst Student Houses are the university-affiliated accommodation. These residences are privately owned and operated by Digs Student, independently of the university.

Storthes Hall is situated in a parkland to the south of the town with 1,386 en-suite single, double or disabled bedrooms in shared flats of six to eight students.

Ashenhurst Houses are located in woodlands close to the campus and Storthes Hall Park. There are 280 single bedrooms in shared houses of six to eight students, all with shared facilities including a communal lounge and kitchen/dining area.

HudLets work with halls of residences and private landlords to ensure students have access to high-quality accommodation at a fair price during their studies. Incorporated In 2014, Huddersfield Students&#x27; Union Lettings LTD (trading as HudLets) is a subsidiary of Huddersfield Students&#x27; Union.

=== Students&#x27; Union ===
Huddersfield Students&#x27; Union (HSU) represents, supports and advises students on all aspects of their time at the university.

HSU is a charity based on campus, led by students for students, although they work closely with the university, it is a completely separate organisation. The Union is home to over 100 student-led Sports Clubs and Societies and five Student Networks helping members making change on and off campus. The student-run radio station Radio Hud and magazine and website Galvanise are among the prominent media-focused societies which operate from the SU. Galvanise relaunched in 2022, having previously been known as T&#x27;Hud.

The Students&#x27; Union is also home to a lettings agency (HudLets), an Advice Centre and Shop.

In November 2017 HSU celebrated its 90th birthday.

In January 2014 HSU moved to Floor 5 of the newly purpose-built Student Central building. The building cost £22.5 million and includes an 800-capacity sports hall, catering outlets, a shop, offices for the student radio station Radio Hud and magazine T&#x27;Hud, and a range of university support services including welfare and the careers centre. There was some controversy when the new building opened as it does not include a bar. Reports suggested the bar in the previous union building had been losing as much as £100,000 a year, with students instead choosing to drink at home or in other nearby pubs and clubs.

The university has developed a significant association with the Royal family in recent years, in particular with the appointment of The Duke of York as patron in 2013 and then chancellor in 2015, although he later resigned in 2019. The Duke&#x27;s former wife, Sarah, Duchess of York, was in 2016 given the title of Visiting Professor of Philanthropreneurship. Their elder daughter, Princess Beatrice, has also visited the university to meet students and view their work.

The Queen visited the campus in 2007 to lay the foundation stone of the Creative Arts Building. Other royals to have visited the university in the years since include the Princess Royal, who in 2015 opened the new Student Central building, the Duke of Kent and the Duke of Gloucester. The Prince of Wales visited University Campus Barnsley in 2012.

In 2022, the university&#x27;s Centre for Precision Technologies was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize, at a prize giving event at St James&#x27;s Palace in London.

<doc id="703696" wikidata="Q526440" url="?curid=703696" title="Great Bitter Lake">
<text>The Great Bitter Lake (; transliterated: &quot;al-Buḥayrah al-Murra al-Kubrā&quot;) is a large saltwater lake in Egypt which is part of the Suez Canal. Before the canal was built in 1869, the Great Bitter Lake was a dry salt valley or basin. References are made to the Great Bitter Lake in the ancient Pyramid Texts. 

The canal connects the Great Bitter Lake to the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. The canal also connects it to the Small Bitter Lake (; transliterated: al-Buhayrah al-Murra as-Sughra). 

Ships traveling through the Suez Canal use the Great Bitter Lake as a &quot;passing lane&quot;, where they can pass other ships or turn around.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English and Arabic names are translations of the Greek name (). It was also known in Latin as &quot;dead lake&quot; (). The ancient Egyptian name for the Bitter Lakes region was &quot;km-wr&quot;, lit. &quot;great black one&quot;.

==Salinity==
The salinity of the lake varies along its depth and is highest at the bottom where the water is in contact with the preexisting salt deposit, which has been consistently diminishing due to dissolution –thereby steadily increasing the depth of the lake– since the canal started operation in 1869. 

Salinity is subject to seasonal variation as a result of yearly evaporation cycles. In the early 20th century, the minimum and maximum values were measured as 4.5% and 5.4%, respectively, with an average salinity of 4.9% (&quot;i.e.&quot; 49 g of salt per kg of lake water).

When the Suez Canal was closed for eight years, beginning during the Six-Day War in 1967, the salinity of the lake increased substantially. In 2017 the minimum and maximum values measured at 4.1% and 4.5%, with an average close to 4.1%.

The salinity of the lake also depends on how much seawater flows into it from the Red and the Mediterranean Seas. Even when the canal is open, in certain places the Great Bitter Lake can have a salinity level &quot;more than twice&quot; the level of the sea. While this makes it difficult for plant life to exist there, many species (of crabs, for example) migrate from the Red Sea through the area.

As the canal has no locks, seawater flows freely into the lake from the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In general, north of the lakes, the current reverses seasonally, being north-going in winter and south-going in summer. South of the lakes, the current is tidal, reversing with the tides in the Red Sea.
Fish and crabs can migrate, generally in a northerly direction, through the canal and lakes in what is known as a Lessepsian migration, as some Red Sea species have come to colonize the eastern Mediterranean.

== Molluscan species ==
=== Description and brief history ===
Following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the area has witnessed massive marine migrations from the canal to the Mediterranean. Anti-Lessepsian migrations, species migrating from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, were rare. The first recorded molluscan anti-Lessepsian migrant was &quot;Cerastoderma glaucum&quot; by Fisher (1870).

The hypersaline state of the water in the lake was found to make faunal and floral growth impossible there. Nevertheless, some seaweed was found on the eastern side of the lake, giving a slight hope of prolific biotope.

In 1998, Hoenselaar and Dekker studied the material collected in 1950 by Beets (1953), in which they discovered a total of 44 gastropods and 47 bivalve species in the lake. Of these species, they concluded that only three gastropods and five bivalves were of Mediterranean origin. The rest were all originally from the Red Sea. This imbalance of origin is due to the water currents, which mainly flow toward the Mediterranean Sea, generally hampering migration from the Mediterranean Sea toward the Red Sea. Still, in the years since 1950, more molluscan populations likely have migrated.

=== Gastropods and bivalves of the Great Bitter Lake ===
Thirty-one gastropods (table 1) and 19 bivalve species (table 2) are documented in the lake. The gastropods &quot;Pusulina radiata&quot; and &quot;Cyclope neritea&quot;, and the bivalves &quot;Cerastoderma glauca&quot; and &quot;Tapes decussatus&quot; are the only anti-Lessepsian species that are originally from the Mediterranean Sea. 

Between spring 2016 and winter 2017, 41 different species of four phyla were found, among which were 12 molluscan species. Of all phyla, molluscs recorded the highest density, with a record of 90,632 individuals per m2, due to the dominant presence of &quot;Modiolus oriculatus&quot; (75,052 individuals per m2 annually).

=== Molluscs and heavy metals ===
The Great Bitter Lake’s bottom soil is mainly composed of mud and sand (mostly carbonate), which can be related to the extensive and continuous drilling activities happening in the Suez Canal for its expansion. The soil is bleak due to the stagnant nature of the lake combined with the accumulation of pollutants coming from the naval traffic that occurs inside the lake. The motionless state of the lake, though, transforms the lake sediments into a depository of heavy metals. Several factors determine the availability of heavy metals at the bottom of the lake. In the recent years, a major part of heavy-metal pollution has originated from overpopulation, industrialization, sewage, dumpsites, crude-oil spills, agricultural chemicals, and more. Once these heavy metals integrate with the sediments composing the lake&#x27;s soil, they serve as a guide to local pollution, answering the questions of where, how, and when did the polluting event occur. Heavy metals are spread out heterogeneously over the lake’s area. The different concentrations of these metals were in 11 areas of the lake; six were onshore at 2–3 m deep, and five were offshore at a depth of 12–15 m.

Molluscs are bioindicators of heavy-metal pollution in an aquatic body due to their ability to absorb heavy metals. The distribution of heavy metals is widespread all over the lake at different depths in both water and sediments. Each station records a certain level for the heavy metals available in its periphery. Each type of chemical reaches its highest (or lowest) concentration somewhere in the lake and each at different spots. On one side, the distribution shows that the pollution is not only concentrated in one area of the lake, but also that it is vastly spread out; on the other side, it shows that molluscan species inside the lake are not all exposed to the same quantity nor type of heavy metals. Consequently, molluscan species accumulate different types of heavy metals depending on their location in the lake, which can be used to estimate the various toxicity rates in the water of the lake. 

==Quincy agreement==

On 14 February 1945, Great Bitter Lake was the site of the Quincy agreement. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, having flown directly from the Yalta Conference, met on board the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Quincy&quot; with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.
President Roosevelt&#x27;s interpreter was U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Bill Eddy, who recorded the men&#x27;s conversation in his book &quot;FDR Meets Ibn Saud&quot;. The meeting is the subject of a BBC documentary by Adam Curtis, entitled &quot;Bitter Lake&quot; (2015).

==Yellow Fleet==

During the Six-Day War in 1967, the canal was closed. Egypt kept it closed until 1975, trapping 15 ships in the lake. These ships became known as the &quot;Yellow Fleet&quot;, because of the desert sands that soon covered their decks. The crews of the ships eventually organized, shared resources, and later set up their own post office and stamp. Two German-flagged ships eventually sailed out of the canal on their own power. Stranded cargo included various perishables (such as eggs and fruit), T-shirts, and a load of toys destined for Woolworth&#x27;s.

<text>Leeds Beckett University (LBU), formerly known as Leeds Metropolitan University (LMU) and before that as Leeds Polytechnic, is a public university in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It has campuses in the city centre and Headingley. The university&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1824, with the foundation of the Leeds Mechanics Institute. Leeds Polytechnic was formed in 1970, and was part of the Leeds Local Education Authority until it became an independent Higher Education Corporation on 1 April 1989. In 1992, the institution gained university status. The current name was adopted in September 2014.

The annual income of the institution for 2016–17 was £221.4 million of which £3.4 million was from grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £217.1 million.

== History ==

The university traces its roots to 1824 when the Leeds Mechanics Institute was founded. The institute later became the Leeds Institute of Science, Art and Literature and in 1927 was renamed Leeds College of Technology. In 1970, the college merged with Leeds College of Commerce (founded 1845), part of Leeds College of Art (f. 1846) and Yorkshire College of Education and Home Economics (f. 1874), forming Leeds Polytechnic. In 1976, James Graham College and the City of Leeds College of Education (f. 1907 as part of City of Leeds Training College) joined Leeds Polytechnic. In 1987, the Polytechnic became one of the founding members of the Northern Consortium.

===Name change===
After plans to change the name to Leeds Carnegie were abandoned, in 2013 it was announced that the Board of Governors had applied to the Privy Council to change the name to Leeds Beckett University, after one of the university&#x27;s founding colleges, Beckett Park, which in turn was named after Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe. The proposed change resulted in a backlash among students. The Privy Council approved Leeds Metropolitan University&#x27;s application to change its name to Leeds Beckett University in November 2013. The name change took place in September 2014.

=== Coat of arms and crest ===
Leeds Beckett University was granted its arms in 1993 under warrant authorised by Sir Conrad Marshall John Fisher Swan, Garter Principal King of Arms (1992–1995). Symbolism found within the coat of arms:

* Green colour - conservation
* Owl - Leeds and wisdom
* Yorkshire rose - County symbol
* Open books - learning
* Chevron - represents a place of protection
* Fountain - knowledge

== Campuses ==

=== City Campus ===
This comprises a number of locations on the northern side of Leeds city centre, largely between the Inner Ring Road and the University of Leeds campus. In addition to the former Polytechnic site, several other buildings have recently been acquired. These include: Old Broadcasting House, the former home of the BBC in Leeds; Electric Press, a building on Millennium Square; and Old School Board, the birthplace of school education in Leeds. The latest additions for the 2008/09-year were the Rose Bowl, the new home of the Leeds Business School, opposite the Civic Hall and designed to reflect the facade of the Civic Hall, and the Broadcasting Place complex, including Broadcasting Tower, a new set of buildings which fits in with the red stone brick buildings famous in Leeds and which provides teaching space for the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology, the Faculty of Art, Architecture and Design, and the School of Cultural Studies and Humanities, as well as student accommodation. Three buildings on the site have been disposed of since becoming a university, the Brunswick building was sold and in 2008 demolished; it is now the site of the Leeds Arena. A further tower block has been sold and is now a Premier Inn. More recently, Cloth Hall Court has also been disposed of and sold to their neighbour, The University of Leeds. The remaining largely 1960s buildings of the former polytechnic were reclad in the early 2010s.

New high-rise student accommodation has been built around the City Campus and includes Opal Tower and the Sky Plaza. These are now the tallest buildings in the Northern half of the city centre.

=== Headingley Campus ===
A campus sited in Beckett Park, Headingley, the campus is connected to the city centre by Headingley railway station which is a short walk from the campus. Bus routes on Otley Road and Kirkstall Lane are also close by.
====James Graham Building====

The main building was constructed in 1912 as the Education Block for the City of Leeds Training College and is a Grade II Listed Building of red brick, gritstone ashlar dressings, slate and a lead roof. It is of classical Neo-Georgian style by G. W. Atkinson, the winner of an architectural competition. The main entrance is reached by a flight of stairs to a recessed portico framed by 4 Corinthian pillars and a pediment above, and the building as a whole was constructed around two internal quadrangles. However, these have now been filled in to create large lecture theatres.
During the WW I and WW II it was used as a military hospital.
It is now named after James Graham, Secretary of Education of the City of Leeds, who was a major instigator of the Training College, and greatly involved in the planning (some at his own expense) and supervision of the project. He also named all of the Halls, apart from Priestley, which was chosen by a committee.

====The Halls====

The James Graham Building stands in front of a large lawn called the Acre. On the two sides are buildings of the same date and materials, which were originally halls of residence for the college students but are now teaching facilities. These are also Grade II Listed buildings. Bronte Hall was designed by G. W. Atkinson. The others were designed by the runners up in the architecture competition, using Bronte as a template but allowing individual touches. The five halls on the East were for women, the two halls on the West were for men (women being more numerous as teachers).

====The Grange====

This is a Grade II* listed building of ashlar gritstone with blue slate roofs and a lead-covered dome. The earliest portions date from 1752, but there were major alterations in about 1834 and 1858 by the Beckett family, who ultimately sold it and the surrounding estate to Leeds Corporation to build the college and make a public park. It was used by the college as a hall of residence for men, but the university converted it into IT offices and service areas.

===Carnegie Campus===

In 2006, the campus extended beyond the confines of Beckett Park to include the Carnegie Stand at the Headingley Stadium. This dual-purpose stand accommodates more than 4,500 spectators, and also provides teaching rooms and a hall. After bulldozing R. W. Rich Hall, a student hall of residence built in the 1960s, the Carnegie Village, was opened in August 2009, providing on-campus accommodation for 479 students.

=== Accommodation ===

The university provides 4,500 bedrooms in a variety of locations and all first year undergraduates are guaranteed a place in university accommodation, so long as Leeds Beckett University is the student&#x27;s first choice university.
Carnegie Village was newly built in September 2010 and provides Passivhaus standard townhouses and apartments at Headingley Campus. The largest hall is Kirkstall Brewery on Broad Lane which has places for over 1,000 students and is about from the Headingley campus. As its name suggests, it is a former brewery property, but is mostly modern blocks. The second largest is Sugarwell Court, in Meanwood, which is about from the City campus, and accommodates 388 students. This is also a converted industrial site.

Two of the most popular accommodation buildings are next to each other in Burley near The Leeds Studios and from City Campus. Formerly owned by Opal Property Group and now owned by Greystar Real Estate Partners, they are Marsden House (previously Opal 1) and Leeds Student Village (previously Opal 2).

Accommodation types not owned by the university vary. Across North Leeds there are many sites which are primarily low-rise buildings, often converted from a former industrial use. The growing number of sites around the city centre has led to the building of new highrise complexes, these include CLV Leeds (previously Opal 3), The Skyplaza and Broadcasting Tower.

==Organisation and governance==
Peter Slee joined the university as Vice-Chancellor in September 2015, succeeding Susan Price, who had been in post since January 2010.

The current Deputy Vice-Chancellors are Paul Smith (Strategic Development), Silke Machold (Research &amp; Innovation) and Phil Cardew (Academic).

*Art, Architecture and Design
*Built Environment, Engineering &amp; Computing
*Business
*Clinical &amp; Applied Sciences
*Cultural studies and humanities
*Education
*Events, Tourism &amp; Hospitality management
*Film, music &amp; performing arts
*Health &amp; community studies
*Law
*Department of Languages

====Law====
Leeds Law School offers undergraduate, postgraduate and professional law courses, as well as having a Law Research Unit. Postgraduate law courses include the Legal Practice Course (LPC) and the conversion course, the Graduate Diploma in Law. Undergraduate courses include the LLB (Hons) Law. The Dean of Leeds Law School is Deveral Capps, who joined Leeds Beckett in February 2015.

Leeds Law School is based at Portland (), in the Leeds city centre. Facilities include a Mock Courtroom, a Hydra Foundation Suite, study spaces and a Postgraduate Resource Room.

==Reputation and rankings==

In November 2006, the university won the award for &quot;outstanding contribution to the local community&quot; at the annual higher education awards ceremony hosted by &quot;The Times Higher Education Supplement&quot;. It also came second in the main category, &quot;the university of the Year&quot;, which was won by the University of Nottingham. In this category, the university was highly commended for its &quot;low-charging, high impact&quot; strategy.

In June 2007, the university was recognised for its environmentally friendly attitude by being ranked number one in the UK in the Green League 2007: a ranking of sustainability in the higher education sector, compiled by People &amp; Planet.

In June 2013, Leeds Beckett University became only the third university in the UK to achieve the Customer Service Excellence standard, a Government benchmark awarded to public sector bodies who demonstrate a commitment to driving customer-focused change within their organisation.

In 2013, the university obtained the Gold Investors in People standard, one of only a handful of higher education institutions to do so.

In January 2015, Leeds Beckett University entered Stonewall&#x27;s nationally recognised league table of gay-friendly employers at number 51 in the rankings.

== Leeds Beckett University repository ==
In common with many institutions in the UK, and globally, the university maintains an open access repository that comprises an open access research archive and an OER repository: A store of open educational resources produced at Leeds Beckett that are freely available for reuse under a Creative Commons (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales) licence.

== Partnerships ==
The university has established a number of sporting and cultural partnerships, both in the UK and overseas.

Simon Lee embarked on a controversial programme of partnerships with external bodies during his time as vice-chancellor, which were dubbed as &quot;rubbing shoulders&quot; after the university took a majority stake in the Leeds Tykes rugby club, renaming it Leeds Carnegie. It was subsequently revealed that the club signed Waisale Serevi after he had been paid for other work at the university. The university sold its stake in April 2009.

The university spent large sums on other partnerships, including £423,000 to the Northern Ballet Theatre and £283,000 on the Irish Football Association.

In April 2014, the Quality Assurance Agency confirmed the quality and standards of provision at Leeds Beckett University.
In October 2009, the Quality Assurance Agency gave the university a &quot;limited confidence&quot; rating, due to concerns over maintenance of academic standards.
In 2009 Simon Lee resigned following a series of controversies over the university&#x27;s fees strategy, allegations of bullying and foreign travel for his wife paid for by the university. The chancellor, Brendan Foster, also resigned less than a month later. The controversies that led to these resignations formed part of the edition of 29 July 2010 of the BBC Radio 4 documentary &quot;Face the Facts&quot;.

=== Sporting ===
* Leeds Rugby — Leeds Rhinos and Leeds Carnegie
* Yorkshire County Cricket Club
* In January 2007, the university became the primary sponsor for Rugby Football League&#x27;s main knock-out cup competition, the Challenge Cup. This is the first partnership of this kind between the governing body of a sport in England and a university
* In May of the same year, the university purchased a 51% stake in the Leeds Tykes rugby union club. The name of the club was changed to Leeds Carnegie to fit with Carnegie College The university subsequently divested itself of that stake
* Carnegie have also sponsored the last three Rugby League World Club Challenge matches. This is an annual match between the domestic champions of the Super League and the Australasian NRL. Incidentally all three of the matches sponsored by Carnegie have been won by the European team.
* Leeds Carnegie was a brand name used by several sports teams associated with the Carnegie School of Physical Education, now part of Leeds Beckett University.

=== Cultural ===
* Royal Armouries
* West Yorkshire Playhouse

== Students&#x27; Union ==
Leeds Beckett Students&#x27; Union is the representative body for students and is affiliated to the National Union of Students. In 2012, it was voted the second best Students&#x27; Union in the city of Leeds and 39th nationally. In 2016 it was voted 6th best SU in the country. The union on the City Campus has a Student Advice Service and a bar &quot;The Hive&quot; which contains two live music venues called &quot;The Stage&quot; and Stage 2. The Headingley campus also has its own bar called &quot;The Hive&quot;.

<text>Gastón Norberto Gaudio (; born 9 December 1978) is an Argentine former professional tennis player. He won eight singles titles and achieved a career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 5 in April 2005. Gaudio&#x27;s most significant championship came at the 2004 French Open, when he defeated fellow Argentine Guillermo Coria from two sets down in the final.

==Early life==
Gaudio learned the game at the Temperley Lawn Tennis Club, and his first coach was Roberto Carruthers. He was the youngest of 3 children in his family. In addition to tennis Gaudio played football and rugby as a child and chose tennis to help out his parents financially when their business ran into economic problems.

==Tennis career==
Gaudio started playing tennis at the age of six. He finished as No. 2 in Argentine juniors in 1996 and turned professional the same year.

===1996-1997===

Gaudio finished as No. 2 junior in Argentina in 1996. Gaudio was ranked at 639 in the world in 1997.

===1998: Top 150===
In 1998 he reached four ATP Challenger finals during the second half of the year and won three of them. He won in Elche with a victory over fellow Argentine Diego Hipperdinger in July. He lost in Belo Horizonte to Brazilian Francisco Costa, and won in Santa Cruz with a victory over Ecuadorian Luis Morejón, both in August. He finished the year by winning in Santiago defeating Karim Alami and ranked world No. 138.

===1999: Top 70===
Gaudio won two consecutive Challengers in Nice and Espinho defeating Jacobo Díaz and Markus Hipfl, respectively. Gaudio&#x27;s first notable performance was when he reached the third round at the French Open as a qualifier, so he won five matches total at the event, including coming back from two sets to love down in the second round against Bernd Karbacher to win, 6–7, 4–6, 6–3, 6–1, 6–4, then losing to world No. 6 Àlex Corretja. He finished the year ranked No. 73.

===2000: Top 25===
2000 saw Gaudio establish himself on the main tour and win his only Challenger of the year in Braunschweig over countryman Franco Squillari, 6–4, 6–7, 6–4. In addition to his Challenger title, Gaudio made the semifinals in Auckland, Santiago and, in his most impressive performance of the season, the Monte Carlo Masters, where he defeated Marat Safin, Félix Mantilla, Julien Boutter, and Juan Carlos Ferrero without dropping a set, before losing to Slovakia&#x27;s Dominik Hrbatý in a tough three-set match, 4–6, 7–5, 6–2. Gaudio also made the final of Stuttgart, again playing against fellow-Argentine Franco Squillari. Gaudio lost the final, 2–6, 6–3, 6–4, 4–6, 2–6, despite having beaten his opponent soundly in the Gstaad quarterfinals and in the Braunschweig finals earlier in the year (both on clay) and leading Squillari 2 sets to 1 in Stuttgart. Gaudio also represented Argentina in his first Olympic Games, losing to Vladimir Voltchkov of Belarus, 6–7, 6–4, 1–6, in the first round. He finished the year ranked No. 34.

===2001: Second ATP final===
Gaudio started his 2001 in poor fashion, losing his first four matches of the season to Vladimir Voltchkov, former French Open finalist Andrei Medvedev, three-time French Open winner Gustavo Kuerten, and, in his Davis Cup debut, Mexican Bruno Echagaray. Gaudio soon went back to his winning ways, however, reaching the final of Viña del Mar, losing to bitter rival and countryman Guillermo Coria, 6–4, 5–7, 2–6. Gaudio would avenge that defeat to Coria in a hard-fought victory in the quarterfinals of Buenos Aires, which involved both players making rude gestures and insulting each other regularly. After this victory, Gaudio lost in the semifinals to José Acasuso, 3–6, 6–7. In the American hard-court swing after the 2001 Australian Open, he made the quarterfinals of the Miami Masters, losing to 19th seed Jan-Michael Gambill, 6–3, 5–7, 4–6. Along the way, Gaudio dismantled fifth seed Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 6–4, 6–1, and toughed out a three-set slugfest against future French Open winner and 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero, 6–0, 3–6, 6–3. Although he did not manage to win his first title in 2001, Gaudio had some success, making a final, a semifinal and four quarterfinals (one of them at the prestigious Miami Masters). In addition to this, he helped Argentina return to the World Group with a perfect 5–0 record in his singles matches, which were all played in Argentina on clay courts. The year was not great though; Gaudio lost a lot of early-round matches and an astounding 12 first-round matches, never making it past the first round of a Grand Slam. Because of his inability to win these early-round matches, Gaudio&#x27;s ranking slipped from No. 34 at the beginning of the year to No. 48 at the end of 2001.

===2002: First ATP title===
Gaudio had a decent start to his 2002 campaign, making the third round of the Australian Open and the quarterfinals of Indian Wells Masters as well as the round of 16 at Miami Masters. Continuing on from his successful Davis Cup debut, in 2002 Gaudio defeated Ivo Karlović in the fifth match to secure a semifinal place for Argentina. Gaudio also won the first tournament of his career in Barcelona without dropping a set. Gaudio defeated world No. 1 and US Open champion Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals, and then dismissed Spaniard and French Open winner of the same year Albert Costa, 6–4, 6–0, 6–2, in the final. Gaudio followed up his maiden title with another in Mallorca a week later.

Gaudio made the fourth round of the French Open, losing to Juan Carlos Ferrero, 7–6, 1–6, 7–6, 2–6, 4–6, while leading 4–1 in the final set. After Roland Garros, Gaudio made the final in Gstaad and the semifinals in Kitzbühel, losing on both occasions to Àlex Corretja. In the Davis Cup semifinals against Russia, Gaudio was leading 5–1 in the fifth set against Yevgeny Kafelnikov and had a match point, which was overruled by umpire Jorge Dias in Kafelnikov&#x27;s favour, who then went on to take the set 8–6 and the match. He finished the year ranked No. 21.

===2003: Top 20===
There were no titles for Gaudio in 2003, but he was involved in two controversies, the first of them involved compatriot Guillermo Coria in the Hamburg Masters. They were part of an all-Argentine semifinal lineup, the others being David Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri. Gaudio and Coria played in one semifinal, and Coria won the first set and Gaudio the second. Coria took an injury timeout for cramps. After the timeout, Coria, after breaking serve at the change of ends beat his left breast while staring at his opponent, which Gaudio took as an insult. Coria proceeded to win the last set 6–0, and there was allegedly a confrontation after the match in the locker room.

The other was the Davis Cup in the semifinals against Spain in Málaga, where the two top Argentine players Guillermo Coria and David Nalbandian were unavailable due to injury. An out-of-form Gaudio was called up along with Agustín Calleri, Mariano Zabaleta, and Lucas Arnold. Although Gaudio had a 4–0 singles record from the first round and quarterfinals coming into the semifinals, Spain won 3–2, with Gaudio losing both of his singles matches. In the first rubber against Juan Carlos Ferrero, he lost 14 games in a row in a 4–6, 0–6, 0–6 defeat. In the fifth and deciding rubber against Carlos Moyà, he lost, 1–6, 4–6, 2–6, and was roundly criticized back in Argentina for these performances. &quot;When I returned to Buenos Aires after playing Davis Cup in Moscow and Málaga, you had the impression it was my fault and that hurt me,&quot; he said. He finished the year ranked No. 34.

===2004: French Open title &amp; top 10===
2004 started slowly for Gaudio, but he eventually reached the final in Barcelona, losing to Tommy Robredo in five sets, then posted two victories in the World Team Cup over Martin Verkerk and Lleyton Hewitt.

Gaudio came into the French Open ranked 44th and was unseeded for the tournament. In the first round, he upset top-10 player and compatriot Guillermo Cañas over two days in five sets. Then he won another five-set match against Jiří Novák. Gaudio dropped only one more set en route to the final, as he defeated Thomas Enqvist, Igor Andreev, Lleyton Hewitt, and David Nalbandian to set up an unprecedented all-Argentine final with world No. 3, then-reigning &quot;King of Clay&quot;, and pre-tournament favourite Guillermo Coria.

In the final, Gaudio defeated Coria, 0–6, 3–6, 6–4, 6–1, 8–6. Gaudio became the first Argentine to win a Grand Slam since Guillermo Vilas in 1979, and the first man ever to win a Grand Slam after losing the first set 6–0. He became the fifth-lowest-ranked player to win a Grand Slam, the first man in the open era to win a Grand Slam having saved match points in the final. Gaudio reached the top 10 in the ATP Entry rankings for the first time. Gaudio had achieved his childhood dream by winning at Roland Garros. He stated that his father, Norberto, who overcame a life-threatening illness, as the biggest inspiration for him.

Gaudio would not reach another Grand Slam quarterfinal for the remainder of his career. In fact, the 2004 French Open was the only occasion he progressed past the fourth round of a grand slam tournament.

Gaudio did not play Wimbledon and returned to the tour in July. He made 3 finals in 3 weeks: in Båstad losing to his friend Mariano Zabaleta, in Stuttgart losing to compatriot Guillermo Cañas in 5 sets, and in Kitzbühel losing to Nicolás Massú. He also made his first appearance at the Tennis Masters Cup, where he lost all 3 matches in the Round Robin stage. He finished the year ranked world No. 10. It was also a golden age in tennis for Argentina as an unprecedented 3 Argentine players finished in top 10 (Guillermo Coria finished No. 7, David Nalbandian finished No. 9).

===2005: Top 5===
Gaudio consolidated his top-10 ranking in 2005, by winning five tournaments and his record of 42–8 on clay is second only to Nadal. He also reached his career-high ranking of No. 5 in April.

Gaudio and Coria were at the centre of another dispute at the World Team Cup where Gaudio said, &quot;Let&#x27;s be truthful, this isn&#x27;t a team, because there&#x27;s someone who makes decisions choosing the best for himself. I can understand that a player gets tired and decides to rest before Paris. I also did so on Tuesday against the Czechs but not in the most important match of all. Coria and I were the best team and if we were a real team this wouldn&#x27;t have happened.&quot;

He lost in the fourth round of Roland Garros to David Ferrer after leading 4–0 in the fifth set and losing six consecutive games. When leading in the fifth set, Gaudio said to Ferrer&#x27;s coach at one point, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry; I&#x27;m not going to win today.&quot; Gaudio also qualified again for the Tennis Masters Cup, where he made the semifinals, defeating Mariano Puerta and Fernando González, but losing to Nikolay Davydenko in the round-robin stage, before losing to Roger Federer, 0–6, 0–6, in the semifinals. He finished the year ranked world No. 10 for the second consecutive year. For the second consecutive year, 3 Argentines finished in the top 10 (Nalbandian finished No. 6, Coria finished No. 8).

===2006: 250 career wins===

Gaudio was not able to keep up his level of play to the standards he set from mid-2004 to 2005. His best performances for 2006 included semifinals in Acapulco and the Monte Carlo Masters. He finished the year ranked at No. 34. Ranked in the top 10, Gaudio started 2006 off well at the French Open, where he lost in the fourth round in four sets to Russia&#x27;s Nikolay Davydenko. Gaudio lost at the second round in Wimbledon to Irakli Labadze (a qualifier) and lost his 2006 US Open third-round match to Marc Gicquel.

===2007===
Gaudio started 2007 poorly and lost eight consecutive matches stretching back to 2006, before recording a victory over Luis Horna, who retired from the match with a strained hamstring. Gaudio followed up with a conventional win against Juan Pablo Guzmán, before losing to former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the quarterfinals of Acapulco. At the French Open, he won his first-round match against Marc Gicquel (he lost to him the previous year) in five sets. He was to face former world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, seeded 14th for the tournament, and won the first two sets, 6–4, 6–3. Despite the lead, however, Hewitt fought back and won the next three sets, thus the match. As a result, Gaudio&#x27;s ranking dropped to No. 99. In late 2007, Gaudio&#x27;s ATP ranking had fallen to No. 180. During the second part of the year, he started to play clay-court Challenger events in Europe to attempt to rebuild his career, but he suffered an ankle injury while playing in the Napoli Challenger.

===2008===
Gaudio only played two matches during the entire season. He came back in January 2008 at a Challenger event in Miami, Florida. He lost in the opening round, 0–6, 3–6, to Kei Nishikori. Later in the month, Gaudio continued his comeback attempt at the Movistar Open in Viña del Mar, Chile. Granted a wild card into the main draw of the tournament, Gaudio lost to Santiago Ventura, 0–6, 3–6, in the first round. He did not play another match for the remainder of the 2008 season.

Gaudio finished the 2008 season unranked as a result of not winning a single match over a period of 12 months, causing his ranking points to fall to 0 by 22 September 2008.

===2009===
In January, Gaudio reached the quarterfinals of Iquique Challenger, where he retired without completing a single game. It was his first match played after a few days short of an entire year.

In February 2009, he received a wild card into the main draw for the Buenos Aires tournament, an ATP World Tour 250 event in his home country. Gaudio lost to Daniel Gimeno Traver of Spain in the first round, 2–6, 6–4, 2–6.

He received another wild card into the main draw in the Barcelona tournament, an ATP World Tour 500 event, where he won his first match on the world tour since the 2007 French Open by defeating Diego Junqueira of Argentina, 6–4, 3–6, 6–4, before losing his second-round match to Tommy Robredo, 6–7, 1–6.

Gaudio won a tournament after almost four years at the Tunis Challenger. He beat Portuguese Frederico Gil, 6–2, 1–6, 6–3, in the final. Gaudio was awarded a wild card into the 2009 French Open, where he was beaten by Czech Radek Štěpánek in the first round, 3–6, 4–6, 1–6. In October, he made the final of the Buenos Aires Challenger, losing to training partner Horacio Zeballos.

Gaudio finished the 2009 season ranked at No. 167.

===2010===
In an interview on the Argentine program Vertigo, Gaudio revealed that he had received psychiatric treatment for clinical depression during his time away from tennis. After a poor start in 2010, he won the San Remo Challenger, defeating countryman Martín Vassallo Argüello, 7–5, 6–0.

In an unlikely turn of events, Gaudio returned to the French Open to play in the qualifying. He posted an impressive victory over American Lester Cook in the first round but was taken out by Thiago Alves in straight sets in his next match.

Gaudio announced his retirement from tennis on 30 August 2011, although his last match played was on 2 August 2010 at the Kitzbühel Challenger where he lost in the first round, more than a year prior.

<text>The University of Lincoln is a public research university in Lincoln, England, with origins dating back to 1861. It gained university status in 1992 and its present name in 2001. The main campus is in the heart of the city of Lincoln alongside the Brayford Pool. There are satellite campuses across Lincolnshire in Riseholme and Holbeach and graduation ceremonies take place in Lincoln Cathedral.

==History==
===19th and 20th centuries===
The University of Lincoln developed out of several educational institutions, including &quot;Hull School of Art&quot; (1861), &quot;Hull Technical Institute&quot; (1893), the Roman Catholic teacher-training &quot;Endsleigh College&quot; (1905), &quot;Hull Central College of Commerce&quot; (1930), and &quot;Kingston upon Hull College of Education&quot; (1913). These merged in 1976 into &quot;Hull College of Higher Education&quot;, with a change of name to &quot;Humberside College of Higher Education&quot; in 1983, absorbing several courses with international reputations and recruitment established by Grimsby College of Technology in fishing, food and manufacturing, which were delivered across both sites.

It became Humberside Polytechnic in 1991. 

In 1992 it was one of many UK institutions to become full universities, as the University of Humberside.

The university developed a new campus to the southwest of Lincoln city centre, championed as a key regeneration policy by the new coalition administration of Lincolnshire Council, on a site overlooking the Brayford Pool. Links with Grimsby College were severed and the university&#x27;s campuses in Hull closed. It was renamed the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in January 1996, entering its first 500 Lincoln based students in September 1996.

Queen Elizabeth II opened the university&#x27;s main Lincoln campus, the first new city-centre campus built in the UK for several decades. Over £375 million has been invested at Brayford Pool, transforming a city-centre brownfield site, revitalising the area and attracting investment from the retail, leisure and property sectors. Economists estimate that the university has created at least 3,000 new jobs in Lincoln and generates more than £250 million a year for the local economy – doubling previous local economic growth rates, which Robert Parker who led the council that pushed the redevelopment project through, cited facilitating the university campus as his greatest achievement in politics.

===21st century===

With another change of name to the University of Lincoln in October 2001, the university moved its main campus from Hull to Lincoln in 2002.

On 28 October 2004, the National Centre for Food Manufacturing at Holbeach was reopened by John Hayes, Member of Parliament for South Holland and the Deepings, after redevelopment as a specialist food-science technology park. The consolidation involved the University of Lincoln acquiring the Leicester-based De Montfort University&#x27;s schools in Lincolnshire: the Lincoln School of Art in uphill Lincoln, and the Lincolnshire School of Agriculture&#x27;s sites at Riseholme, Caythorpe and Holbeach. Caythorpe was later closed and its activities moved to Riseholme. Courses held in Grimsby were also moved to Lincoln at that time.

Through the late 1990s, the university&#x27;s sites in Hull were scaled down as the focus shifted towards Lincoln. In 2001 this process took a step further when it was decided to move the administrative headquarters and management to Lincoln and to sell the Cottingham Road campus in Hull, the former main campus, to its neighbour, the University of Hull. The site now houses the Hull York Medical School. Until 2012 the university maintained a smaller campus, the Derek Crothall Building, in Hull city centre. Another campus and student halls in Beverley Road, Hull, were also sold for redevelopment.

In 2012 all agricultural further education provisions were transferred from Riseholme College to Bishop Burton College. Bishop Burton College has now moved into a new, purpose-built site at the Lincolnshire Showground with only limited use of the Riseholme Campus which has now mainly reverted to the University of Lincoln from 2021 onwards. Development of the site has not been decided but the university has purchased the recently vacated Lawress Hall a former training, conferencing and wedding venue on an adjacent site which was formerly owned by the Government.

March 2021 saw the new Lincoln Medical School open in time for the 2021/2022 academic year. The building, on the Brayford Pool campus, features lecture theatres, trainee observation theatres and a library dedicated to medical research, allied health care, pharmacy, chemistry and biology textbooks. It is run as a partnership with the University of Nottingham Medical School.

==Organisation and administration==
===Academic Colleges and schools===
The University of Lincoln is structured as a college and school-based system. There are two colleges (changed from four on 1 August 2023) involved in research and teaching, each headed by a pro-vice-chancellor:

==Academic profile==
===Reputation and rankings===

The university&#x27;s Strategic Plan 2022-2027 sets out targets of being among the top 15 of universities in the UK. Lincoln was ranked 17th by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2020, its highest to date. In 2017, it ranked 8th in Agriculture and Forestry and 2nd in Business and Economics in The Complete University Guide rankings. More than half its submitted research was rated as internationally excellent or world-leading in the UK&#x27;s last nationwide assessment of university research standards, the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014). It was awarded gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF 2017).

In 2020, the university was named Modern University of the Year in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University 2021, as the highest-ranked multi-faculty modern university in the UK, climbing to 45th (out of 135), its highest ever position in the guide. In the same year it was named one of the world&#x27;s greatest young universities in &quot;The Times&quot; Higher Education Young University Rankings, placed 14th in the UK for overall student satisfaction of the 129 mainstream universities in the National Student Survey 2020, and given a five-star rating in the QS Stars rating of global universities.

In December 2023, the University of Lincoln was awarded the top Gold rating overall in the Teaching Excellence Framework. This also includes student experience and student outcomes.

In 2023, the university was awarded the Queens Anniversary Prize for its work in supporting the UK&#x27;s food and farming industries through innovations in research, education and technology. 

===Identity===
The University of Lincoln&#x27;s official logo from 2001 to 2012 was the head of Minerva, an Ancient Roman goddess of wisdom and knowledge. From July 2012 this was changed to incorporate the university&#x27;s coat of arms, which features swans, fleur de lys and textbooks.

==Campus facilities==
===Libraries===

The university Libraries and Learning Skills department has three libraries: the main University Library, a Library at the Holbeach Campus which is part of the National Centre for Food Manufacturing, and the Ross Library for Biomedical and Health Sciences at the Lincoln Medical School.

The University Library occupies the Great Central Warehouse (GCW) building, a renovated industrial railway-goods warehouse. It opened in December 2004 on the Brayford campus. In total it houses over 300,000 books, journals and other reference materials.

The Great Central Warehouse building was built in 1907 by the Great Central Railway. It spent the second half of the 20th century as a builder&#x27;s warehouse, before falling into disrepair in 1998. It was converted into a library by the university&#x27;s in-house team of architects and was formally opened in 2004 by the chief executive of the UK&#x27;s Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. In 2005, the conversion won gold and silver for conservation and regeneration at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Regional Awards in Leicester. It has also gained awards from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).

===Live music===

Built in 1874 by the Manchester, Sheffield &amp; Lincolnshire Railway, the Engine Shed was the one surviving four-track, dead-end railway building in Lincolnshire. It opened as a refitted entertainment venue in September 2006 as the region&#x27;s largest live music venue. It consists of the Engine Shed, the Platform and Tower Bar, which combined can accommodate up to 2,000 people. In 2014 the university transferred control of The Engine Shed to the Students&#x27; Union.

===Lincoln Arts Centre===
The Lincoln Arts Centre (LAC) holds a 450-seat multi-purpose auditorium designed for live arts performances, conferences and film screenings. Its events are designed to complement, rather than compete with those of neighbouring venues.

===Science and Innovation Park===
The Lincoln Science and Innovation Park is a large redevelopment south of the main university campus. It will comprise university facilities, including laboratories, and space for industry partners to add new offices and research facilities.

The Science and Innovation Park is being developed in partnership with the Lincolnshire Co-operative.

===Sports Centre===
Facilities include a double sports hall, four squash courts, synthetic pitches, a fitness suite, a dance studio, eight badminton and short tennis courts, two basketball courts, two volleyball courts, two netball courts, two five-a-side football pitches and a seven-a-side football pitch. It also holds the School of Sport And Exercise Science, the majority of whose facilities are located in the building.

==Student life==
According to the university, over 100 national groupings appear among the student population at the Brayford Pool campus. Based on the available academic year data, the total student population was undergraduates and postgraduates.

===Students&#x27; Union===
The University of Lincoln Students&#x27; Union dates back to the university&#x27;s formation. It was reconstituted in 2007 as a company limited by guarantee, and registered as a charity, introducing a more conventional governance structure for students&#x27; unions. It
supports and represents the students of the university; sabbatical officers are elected by the student body and supported by the staff. A number of sports teams operate in the national BUCS&#x27; leagues, competing nationally against other institutions.

The Students&#x27; Union was awarded NUS (National Union of Students) Higher Education Students&#x27; Union of the Year 2014/15 at an annual awards ceremony.

In 2014, ownership of the on-campus pub &quot;The Shed&quot; was transferred to the Students&#x27; Union after its acquisition from Greene King. It was later renamed &quot;The Swan&quot;. In 2015, the Students&#x27; Union was awarded Best Bar None Gold and named second in the Best Bar None Safest Venue category.

In 2016, after a student referendum, the Students&#x27; Union voted to disaffiliate from the NUS, due to dissatisfaction after the controversial 2016 NUS Conference. The decision was taken to formally leave the NUS in December, but a second referendum was held after approaches from students who opposed the first vote. The re-run had 1,302 students voting to remain part of the NUS and 437 backing disaffiliation.

The issue arose again in 2019, after consultations with students at All Student Member meetings in 2018 and 2019. However, the backlash across the student body caused a referendum to be held to leave the NUS. This proposed disaffiliation from the NUS on 1 January 2020: a total of 2614 (15.7%) of students voted, with 996 to remain, 1,539 to leave and 79 abstaining.

===Student accommodation===
Lincoln offers many accommodation options for students. The university owns and operates the Student Village, including the Lincoln Courts and Cygnet Wharf, a waterfront complex situated on the Brayford Pool Campus. In Lincoln Courts, there are 17 blocks of self-catering apartments, each apartment housing five to eight students, and Cygnet Wharf, three buildings with flats of 10–12 residents. The site has a range of facilities, with a total of 1,037+ bedrooms available including apartments specifically designed for students with disabilities.

Furthermore, there is a range of other University-owned and private off-campus student accommodation in Lincoln.

<text>Stephanie Louise Kwolek (; July 31, 1923 – June 18, 2014) was a Polish-American chemist best known for inventing Kevlar (poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide). Her career at the DuPont company spanned more than 40 years.

For her discovery, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company&#x27;s Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement. As of August 2019, she was the only female employee to have received that honor. In 1995 she became the fourth woman to be added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. Kwolek won numerous awards for her work in polymer chemistry, including the National Medal of Technology, the IRI Achievement Award and the Perkin Medal.

==Early life and education==
Kwolek was one of two children born to Polish immigrant parents in the Pittsburgh suburb of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, in 1923. The grade school she attended was small enough to require her classroom be shared by two different grades, which she found to be an advantage. As Kwolek&#x27;s love of science grew, she easily outpaced even the older children across the room. Her father, John Kwolek, died when she was ten years old. He was a naturalist by avocation, and Kwolek spent hours with him, as a child, exploring the natural world. They would spend afternoons together exploring the woods nearby, collecting plants and observing animals that they would later name and characterize in a scrapbook Kwolek kept, as a child. She attributed her interest in science to him and an interest in fashion design to her mother, Nellie (Zajdel) Kwolek, who worked as a seamstress. Her mother told her that she was too much of a perfectionist to work a career in fashion, so Kwolek decided to become a doctor.

In 1946, Stephanie earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in chemistry from Margaret Morrison Carnegie College of Carnegie Mellon University. She had planned to become a doctor and hoped she could earn enough money from a temporary job in a chemistry-related field to attend medical school.

==DuPont career==
Kwolek was offered a position at DuPont&#x27;s Buffalo, New York, facility in 1946 by William Hale Charch, a future mentor. During her interview with DuPont, Dr. Charch had said the company would reach out to her in about two weeks to tell her whether she had secured the job. Kwolek asked if they could possibly respond sooner because she had to notify another company if she would accept their offer. Charch then called in his receptionist to dictate Kwolek&#x27;s offer letter in front of her. 

As a chemical company, DuPont was trying to find a petroleum-based polymer fiber that would be lighter and harder-wearing than steel in radial tires. The firm had vacancies, given that many men had been overseas fighting in World War II. DuPont had introduced nylon shortly before the war, and that business boomed and blossomed into several textile applications. 
At the same time, the protracted second World War emphasized the need for a lightweight, wearable armor to protect personnel and equipment. As the war raged overseas, soldiers engaged in battle had to do without body armor because there was no material strong enough to stop a rifle bullet but light enough to wear in battle. Steel was the only armor material available, and its weight limited its use to armored vehicles. Even then, steel could be pierced by specialized armor-piercing ammunition. 

Kwolek intended to work for DuPont temporarily, in order to raise money for further study. At DuPont, the polymer research she worked on was so interesting and challenging that she decided to drop her plans for medical school and make chemistry a lifetime career.
 Her research group moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1950. In 1959, she won a publication award from the American Chemical Society (ACS), the first of many awards. The paper, The Nylon Rope Trick, demonstrated a way of producing nylon in a beaker at room temperature. It is still a common classroom experiment, and the process was extended to high molecular weight polyamides. In 1985, Kwolek and coworkers patented a method for preparing PBO and PBT polymers. Because Dupont was at the cutting edge of polymer technology and innovation, Kwolek never outgrew the position and spent her whole career doing research at Dupont. Over her 40-year career, Kwolek would file 28 patents. In addition to Kevlar, she contributed to products such as Spandex (Lycra), Nomex, and Kapton. She continued as a consultant to Dupont after her retirement in 1986, and became the first woman to earn the company’s Lavoisier medal for research in 1995. 

She was engaged in the search for new polymers as well as a new condensation process that takes place at lower temperatures around . The melt condensation polymerization process used in preparing nylon, for example, was instead done at more than . The lower-temperature polycondensation processes, which employ very fast-reacting intermediates, make it possible to prepare polymers that cannot be melted and only begin to decompose at temperatures above .

===Kevlar===
Kwolek is best known for her work during the 1950s and 1960s with aramids, or &quot;aromatic polyamides&quot;, a type of polymer that can be made into strong, stiff, and flame-resistant fibres. Her laboratory work in aramids was conducted under the supervision of research fellow Paul W. Morgan, who calculated that the aramids would form stiff fibres owing to the presence of bulky benzene (or &quot;aromatic&quot;) rings in their molecular chains but that they would have to be prepared from solution because they melt only at very high temperatures. Kwolek determined the solvents and polymerization conditions suitable for producing poly-m-phenylene isophthalamide, a compound that DuPont released in 1961, as a flame-resistant fibre with the trade name Nomex. She then extended her work into poly-p-benzamide and poly-p-phenylene terephthalamide, which she noted adopted highly regular rodlike molecular arrangements in solution. From these two &quot;liquid crystal polymers&quot; (the first ever prepared), fibres were spun that displayed unprecedented stiffness and tensile strength. The innovative polymer Poly-p-phenylene terephthalamide, as invented by Kwolek, was released commercially under the name Kevlar. 
In 1964, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage, Kwolek&#x27;s group began searching for a lightweight yet strong fiber to replace the steel used in tires. The polymers she had been working with, poly-p-phenylene terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystal while in solution that at the time had to be melt-spun at over , which produced weaker and less stiff fibers. A unique technique in her new projects and the melt-condensation polymerization process was to reduce those temperatures to between .

As she explained in a 1993 speech:

The solution was unusually (low viscosity), turbid, stir-opalescent and buttermilk in appearance. Conventional polymer solutions are usually clear or translucent and have the viscosity of molasses, more or less. The solution that I prepared looked like a dispersion but was totally filterable through a fine pore filter. This was a liquid crystalline solution, but I did not know it at the time.
This sort of cloudy solution was usually thrown away. Kwolek was denied the use of the spinneret for her solution because it was thought the solution would clog the machine. However, Kwolek persuaded technician Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution. She was amazed to find that the new fiber would not break when nylon typically would. Not only was it stronger than nylon, Kevlar was five times stronger than steel by weight. Both her supervisor and the laboratory director 
understood the significance of her discovery, and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. Kwolek learned that the fibers could be made even stronger by heat-treating them. The polymer molecules, shaped like rods or matchsticks, are highly oriented, which gives Kevlar its extraordinary strength. Kwolek continued research of thermotropic Kevlar derivatives containing aliphatic and chlorine groups.

===Applications of Kevlar===
Kwolek was not much involved in developing practical applications of Kevlar. Once senior DuPont managers were informed of the discovery, &quot;they immediately assigned a whole group to work on different aspects&quot;, she said. Still, Kwolek continued research on Kevlar derivatives. She did not profit from DuPont&#x27;s products, as she signed over the Kevlar patent to the company.

Kevlar is used in more than 200 applications, including tennis rackets, skis, parachute lines, boats, airplanes, ropes, cables, and bullet-proof vests. It has been used for car tires, fire fighter boots, hockey sticks, cut-resistant gloves and armored cars. It has also been used for protective building materials like bomb-proof materials, hurricane safe rooms, and bridge reinforcements. During the week of Kwolek&#x27;s death, the one millionth bullet-resistant vest made with Kevlar was sold. Kevlar is also used to build cell phone cases; Motorola&#x27;s Droid RAZR has a Kevlar unibody.

Kevlar has gone on to save lives as a lightweight body armor for police and the military; to convey messages across the ocean as a protector of undersea optical-fiber cable; to suspend bridges with super-strong ropes; and to be used in countless more applications from protective clothing for athletes and scientists to canoes, drumheads, and frying pans.

== Awards, honors, and legacy ==
For her discovery of Kevlar, Kwolek was awarded the DuPont company&#x27;s Lavoisier Medal for outstanding technical achievement in 1995, as a &quot;Persistent experimentalist and role model whose discovery of liquid crystalline polyamides led to Kevlar aramid fibers.&quot; At the time of her death in 2014, she was still the only female employee to receive that honor. Her discovery generated several billion dollars of revenue for DuPont, being her employer at the time, but she never benefited directly from it financially.

In 1980, Kwolek received the Chemical Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists, and an Award for Creative Invention from the American Chemical Society. In 1995, Kwolek was added to the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1996, she received the National Medal of Technology and the IRI Achievement Award. In 1997, she received the Perkin Medal from the American Chemical Society. In 2003, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

She has been awarded honorary degrees by Carnegie Mellon University (2001), Worcester Polytechnic Institute (1981) and Clarkson University (1997).

The Royal Society of Chemistry grants a biennial &#x27;Stephanie L Kwolek Award&#x27;, &quot;to recognise exceptional contributions to the area of materials chemistry from a scientist working outside the UK&quot;.

Kwolek is featured as one of the Royal Society of Chemistry&#x27;s &quot;175 Faces of Chemistry&quot;.

==Later life ==
In 1986, Kwolek retired as a research associate for DuPont. Toward the end of her life, she consulted for DuPont, and served on both the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences. During her 40 years as a research scientist, she filed and received either 17 or 28 patents.

She often tutored students in chemistry. She also devised and wrote about numerous classroom demonstrations that are still used in schools today, such as the Nylon Rope Trick.

Kwolek died at the age of 90 on June 18, 2014. Her funeral was at St Joseph on the Brandywine.

<text>A divided city is one which, as a consequence of political changes or border shifts, currently constitutes (or once constituted) two separate entities, or an urban area with a border running through it. Listed below are the localities and the state they belonged to at the time of division.

<doc id="703734" wikidata="Q1190089" url="?curid=703734" title="Caveman">
<text>The caveman is a stock character representative of primitive humans in the Paleolithic. The popularization of the type dates to the early 20th century, when Neanderthals were influentially described as &quot;simian&quot; or &quot;ape-like&quot; by Marcellin Boule and Arthur Keith.

The term &quot;caveman&quot; has its taxonomic equivalent in the now-obsolete binomial classification of &quot;Homo troglodytes&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758).

==Characteristics==

Cavemen are typically portrayed as wearing shaggy animal hides, and capable of cave painting like behaviorally modern humans of the last glacial period. They are often shown armed with rocks, cattle bone clubs, spears, or sticks with rocks tied to them, and are portrayed as unintelligent, easily frightened, and aggressive. Typically, they have a low pitched rough voice and make vocalizations such as &quot;ooga-booga&quot; and grunts or speak using simple phrases. Popular culture also frequently represents cavemen as living with, or alongside of, dinosaurs, even though non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years before the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The era typically associated with the archetype is the Paleolithic Era, sometimes referred to as the Stone Age, though the Paleolithic is but one part of the Stone Age. This era extends from more than 2 million years into the past until between 40,000 and 5,000 years before the present (i.e., from around 2,000 kya to between 40 and 5 kya).

The image of these people living in caves arises from the fact that caves are where the preponderance of artifacts have been found from European Stone Age cultures. However, this most likely reflects the degree of preservation that caves provide over the millennia, rather than an indication of them being a typical form of shelter. Until the last glacial period, the great majority of humans did not live in caves, as nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes lived in a variety of temporary structures, such as tents and wooden huts (e.g., at Ohalo). A few genuine cave dwellings did exist, however, such as at Mount Carmel in Israel.

Stereotypical cavemen have traditionally been depicted wearing smock-like garments made from the skins of animals and held up by a shoulder strap on one side, or loincloths made from leopard or tiger skins. Stereotypical cavewomen are similarly depicted, but sometimes with slimmer proportions and bones tied up in their hair. They are also depicted carrying large clubs approximately conical in shape. They often have grunt-like names, such as &quot;Ugg&quot; and &quot;Zog&quot;.

==History==

Caveman-like heraldic &quot;wild men&quot; were found in European and African iconography for hundreds of years. During the Middle Ages, these beings were generally depicted in art and literature as bearded and covered in hair, and often wielding clubs and dwelling in caves. While wild men were always depicted as living outside of civilization, it was not always clearly whether they were human or non-human.

In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1912), ape-men are depicted in a fight with modern humans. &quot;How the First Letter Was Written&quot; and &quot;How the Alphabet was Made&quot; are two of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot; (1902) featuring a group of cave-people. Edgar Rice Burroughs adapted this idea for &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot; (1918). A genre of cavemen films emerged, typified by D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Genesis&quot; (1912); they inspired Charles Chaplin&#x27;s satiric take in &quot;His Prehistoric Past&quot; (1914), as well as &quot;Brute Force&quot; (1914), &quot;The Cave Man&quot; (1912), and later, &quot;Cave Man&quot; (1934). From the descriptions, Griffith&#x27;s characters cannot talk, and use sticks and stones for weapons, while the hero of &quot;Cave Man&quot; is a Tarzanesque figure who fights dinosaurs. &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot; (1977–1980), is an animated comedy depicting cavemen as being hairy and carrying clubs.

Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Brute Force&quot; represents one of the earliest portrayals of cavemen and dinosaurs together, with its depiction of a &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. The film reinforced the incorrect notion that non-avian dinosaurs co-existed with prehistoric humans. The anachronistic combination of cavemen with dinosaurs eventually became a cliché, and has often been intentionally invoked for comedic effect. The comic strips &quot;B.C.&quot;, &quot;Alley Oop&quot;, the Spanish comic franchise &quot;Mortadelo y Filemón&quot;, and occasionally &quot;The Far Side&quot; and &quot;Gogs&quot; portray &quot;cavemen&quot; with dinosaurs. Gary Larson, in his 1989 book &quot;The Prehistory of the Far Side&quot;, stated he once felt that he needed to confess his cartooning sins in this regard: &quot;O Father, I Have Portrayed Primitive Man and Dinosaurs In The Same Cartoon&quot;. The animated series &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, a spoof on family sitcoms, portrays the Flintstones even using dinosaurs, pterosaurs and prehistoric mammals as tools, household appliances, vehicles, and construction equipment.

<doc id="703736" wikidata="Q1651726" url="?curid=703736" title="Wayne Hays">
<text>Wayne Levere Hays (May 13, 1911 – February 10, 1989) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1949 to 1976. A Democrat, he resigned from Congress after a much-publicized sex scandal.

==Early years==
Hays was born in Bannock, Ohio, the son of Bertha Taylor and Walter L. Hays. He graduated from Ohio State University in 1933. He served as mayor of Flushing, Ohio, from 1939 to 1945 and simultaneously served in the Ohio state senate in 1941 and 1942. Starting in 1945 he served a four-year term as Commissioner of Belmont County. He was a member of the Army Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps from 1933 until called to active duty as a second lieutenant on December 8, 1941, with a medical discharge in August 1942.

==Politics==
Hays was first elected as a Democrat to the 81st Congress in 1948, and was subsequently elected to thirteen succeeding Congresses. He was chairman of the powerful Committee on House Administration.

Hays received 5 votes for President at the 1972 Democratic National Convention without campaigning for the office. In 1976, Hays ran for the party&#x27;s nomination for President as a favorite son candidate in the Ohio primary.

Hays&#x27;s strong rule of the House Administration Committee extended to even the smallest items. In the mid-1970s, lawmakers avoided crossing Hays for fear that he would shut off the air conditioning in their offices.
==Sex scandal==
In May 1976, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; broke the story quoting Elizabeth Ray, Hays&#x27; former secretary, saying that Hays hired her on his staff, and later gave her a raise as staff of the House Administration Committee for two years, to serve as his mistress. Hays had divorced his wife of 38 years just months prior, and married his veteran Ohio office secretary, Patricia Peak, five weeks before the scandal broke. Ostensibly a secretary, Ray admitted: &quot;I can&#x27;t type. I can&#x27;t file. I can&#x27;t even answer the phone.&quot; She even &quot;let a reporter listen in as the Ohio congressman told her on the phone that his recent marriage (to another former secretary) would not affect their arrangement.&quot;

&quot;Time Magazine&quot; reported, &quot;Liz chose to tell her story after Hays decided to marry Pat Peak and did not invite her. &#x27;I was good enough to be his mistress for two years but not good enough to be invited to his wedding,&#x27; she pouted.&quot; Three days later, Hays admitted to most of the allegations on the House floor, denying only &quot;that Miss Ray&#x27;s federal salary was awarded solely for sexual services. She was not, insisted Hays, &#x27;hired to be my mistress.&#x27;&quot; He resigned as chairman of the Committee on House Administration on June 18, 1976, and then resigned from Congress on September 1, 1976.

Marion L. Clark, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor, who was a member of team that reported the sex scandal, was killed September 4, 1977, when she reportedly walked into a moving small private airplane propeller at the airfield of Iosco County Airport, East Tawas, Michigan.

==Personal life==
Hays and his first wife had a daughter, Martha Brigitta.

==Later years==
After leaving office, Hays returned to Red Gate Farm, his 300-acre property in Belmont, Ohio, where he bred Angus cattle and Tennessee Walking Horses. Hays served one term, from 1979 to 1981, as member of the Ohio House of Representatives. In the 1978 Democratic Primary, he defeated Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., a future Judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Hays was defeated for re-election by future Congressman Bob Ney.

Hays died at Wheeling Hospital in Wheeling, West Virginia, on February 10, 1989, at the age of 77, after suffering a heart attack at his home.

<text>The 1983 congressional page sex scandal was a political scandal involving members of the United States House of Representatives.

==Reprimand recommendation==
On July 14, 1983, the House Ethics Committee recommended that Rep. Dan Crane (R-IL) and Rep. Gerry Studds (D-MA) be reprimanded for having engaged in sexual relationships with minors, specifically 17-year-old congressional pages. Though at least some of the sexual contact was not criminal (the age of consent in the District of Columbia being 16 years), the committee felt &quot;any sexual relationship between a member of the House of Representatives and a congressional page, or any sexual advance by a member to a page, represents a serious breach of duty.&quot; The Congressional Report found that in 1980, a year after entering office, Crane had sex four or five times at his suburban apartment with a female page and in 1973, the year he entered office, Studds invited a male page, who testified he felt no ill will towards Studds, to his Georgetown apartment and later on a two-week trip to Portugal. Both representatives admitted to the charges.

==Motion to censure==
On July 20, 1983, the House voted by a supermajority to revise the reprimand recommendation to censure, a more extreme measure. Censure had never previously been used in a case of sexual misconduct. The motion to censure the two House members was introduced by Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-IL), the Republican House Minority Leader. Aides later said that Michel proposed this bill to head off a move by Republicans to expel the two legislators. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA) was one of the leaders of the calls for the expulsion of Crane and Studds.

At the beginning of the debate, Crane said, &quot;I want the members to know I am sorry and that I apologize to one and all.&quot; When he was called to be censured, Crane stood facing the House. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, after the censure was read, Crane, escorted by a friend, quickly left the chamber. However, an Associated Press article says that Crane walked back to his seat in the rear of the House and slumped in it. Crane would go on to lose the 1984 election.

Studds gave up his right to a public hearing reluctantly, saying that he objected to the conclusions of the Ethics Committee but wanted to protect the privacy of the pages involved and that the affair was a &quot;mutually voluntary, private relationship between adults.&quot; At the same time, Studds did admit to &quot;a very serious error in judgment,&quot; saying that he should not have had sex with a congressional subordinate, regardless of the individual&#x27;s age or sex. As his censure was read, Studds faced the Speaker who was reading the motion, with his back to the other House members. Studds continued to be re-elected until his retirement in 1997; he died in 2006.

==Impact==

Shortly after this scandal, the House Page Board was established for the purpose of protecting pages.

<text>John James Ingalls (December 29, 1833August 16, 1900) was an American Republican politician who served as a United States senator from Kansas. Ingalls is credited with suggesting the state motto and designing the state seal.

==Life and career==
John James Ingalls was born in Middleton, Massachusetts, on December 29, 1833. He graduated from Williams College in 1855. Foreshadowing his later reputation as a wit, his commencement oration, entitled &quot;Mummy Life,&quot; was a satire of college life. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1857. Moving to Kansas Territory, Ingalls settled in Atchison in 1860. He joined the anti-slavery forces and worked to make Kansas a free state. He was a member of the Wyandotte constitutional convention in 1859 and is reputed to have coined the state motto, &quot;Ad Astra per Aspera&quot;.

When Kansas was admitted to the Union in 1861, he became secretary of the first state Senate and state senator in 1862. During the Civil War he served as judge advocate in the Kansas militia. As an editor of the Atchison newspaper, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Champion&quot;, for three years, he won a national reputation for a series of magazine articles. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1873, succeeding Samuel C. Pomeroy, Ingalls served for 18 years. He supported labor and agriculture against monopolies. He also favored the Interstate Commerce Act and the Pendleton Civil Service Act. Ingalls rejected the nomination of James Campbell Matthews to the recorder of deeds in 1886. Ingalls claimed that his rejection was because of Matthews&#x27; non-residency of Washington, D.C.; however, journalists argued that his rejection was racially based.

In 1887 Ingalls was elected President pro tempore of the Senate. Praised throughout his life for his keen sarcasm and quick wit, John James Ingalls died in Las Vegas, New Mexico on August 16, 1900. He was buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Atchison.

In 1905, the state of Kansas donated a marble statue of Ingalls to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. After an effort starting in 2011, Kansas replaced Ingalls with Amelia Earhart in 2022.

==Personal life==
John James Ingalls married Anna Louise Chesebrough in 1865, they had eleven children including Sheffield Ingalls. 

John James Ingalls was a second cousin of Charles Ingalls (father to &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;&#x27;s Laura Ingalls Wilder).

<text>Affiliate marketing is a marketing arrangement in which affiliates receive a for each visit, signup or sale they generate for a merchant. This arrangement allows businesses to outsource part of the sales process. It is a form of performance-based marketing where the commission acts as an incentive for the affiliate; this commission is usually a percentage of the price of the product being sold, but can also be a flat rate per referral.

Affiliate marketers may use a variety of methods to generate these sales, including organic search engine optimization, paid search engine marketing, e-mail marketing, content marketing, display advertising, organic social media marketing, and more.

Though the largest companies run their own affiliate networks (for example Amazon), most merchants join affiliate networks which provide reporting tools and payment processing.

==History==

===Origin===
The concept of revenue sharing—paying commission for referred business—predates affiliate marketing and the Internet. The translation of the revenue share principles to mainstream e-commerce happened in November 1994, almost four years after the origination of the World Wide Web.

The concept of affiliate marketing on the Internet was conceived of, put into practice and patented by William J. Tobin, the founder of PC Flowers &amp; Gifts. Launched on the Prodigy Network in 1989, PC Flowers &amp; Gifts remained on the service until 1996. By 1993, PC Flowers &amp; Gifts had generated sales more than $6 million per year on the Prodigy service. In 1998, PC Flowers and Gifts developed the business model of paying a commission on sales to the Prodigy Network.

In 1994, Tobin launched a beta version of PC Flowers &amp; Gifts on the Internet in cooperation with IBM, which owned half of Prodigy. By 1995 PC Flowers &amp; Gifts had launched a commercial version of the website and had 2,600 affiliate marketing partners on the World Wide Web. Tobin applied for a patent on tracking and affiliate marketing on January 22, 1996, and was issued U.S. Patent number 6,141,666 on Oct 31, 2000. Tobin also received Japanese Patent number 4021941 on Oct 5, 2007, and U.S. Patent number 7,505,913 on Mar 17, 2009, for affiliate marketing and tracking. In July 1998 PC Flowers and Gifts merged with Fingerhut and Federated Department Stores.

In November 1994, CDNow launched its BuyWeb program. CDNow had the idea that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with the music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists&#x27; CDs directly from its website but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen&#x27;s website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to the artist&#x27;s music page.

Amazon.com (Amazon) launched its associate program in July 1996: Amazon associates could place banner or text links on their site for individual books, or link directly to the Amazon home page.

When visitors clicked on the associate&#x27;s website to go to Amazon and purchase a book, the associate received a commission. Amazon was not the first merchant to offer an affiliate program, but its program was the first to become widely known and serve as a model for subsequent programs.

In February 2000, Amazon announced that it had been granted a patent on components of an affiliate program. The patent application was submitted in June 1997, which predates most affiliate programs, but not PC Flowers &amp; Gifts.com (October 1994), AutoWeb.com (October 1995), Kbkids.com/BrainPlay.com (January 1996), EPage (April 1996), and several others.

===Historic development===
Affiliate marketing has grown quickly since its inception. The e-commerce website, viewed as a marketing toy in the early days of the Internet, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew to a bigger business than the existing offline business. According to one report, the total sales amount generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was £2.16 billion in the United Kingdom alone. The estimates were £1.35 billion in sales in 2005. MarketingSherpa&#x27;s research team estimated that, in 2006, affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5 billion in bounty and commissions from a variety of sources in retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, education, publishing, and forms of lead generation other than contextual advertising programs.

In 2006, the most active sectors for affiliate marketing were adult gambling, retail industries and file-sharing services. The three sectors expected to experience the greatest growth are the mobile phone, finance, and travel sectors. Soon after these sectors came the entertainment (particularly gaming) and Internet-related services (particularly broadband) sectors. Also several of the affiliate solution providers expect to see increased interest from business-to-business marketers and advertisers in using affiliate marketing as part of their mix.

===Web 2.0===

Websites and services based on Web 2.0 concepts—blogging and interactive online communities, for example—have impacted the affiliate marketing world as well. These platforms allow improved communication between merchants and affiliates. Web 2.0 platforms have also opened affiliate marketing channels to personal bloggers, writers, and independent website owners. Contextual ads allow publishers with lower levels of web traffic to place affiliate ads on websites.

==Compensation methods==

===Predominant compensation methods===
Eighty percent of affiliate programs today use revenue sharing or pay per sale (PPS) as a compensation method, nineteen percent use cost per action (CPA), and the remaining programs use other methods such as cost per click (CPC) or cost per mille (CPM, cost per estimated 1000 views).

===Diminished compensation methods===
Within more mature markets, less than one percent of traditional affiliate marketing programs today use cost per click and cost per mille. However, these compensation methods are used heavily in display advertising and paid search.

Cost per mille requires only that the publisher make the advertising available on his or her website and display it to the page visitors in order to receive a commission. Pay per click requires one additional step in the conversion process to generate revenue for the publisher: A visitor must not only be made aware of the advertisement but must also click on the advertisement to visit the advertiser&#x27;s website.

Cost per click was more common in the early days of affiliate marketing but has diminished in use over time due to click fraud issues very similar to the click fraud issues modern search engines are facing today. Contextual advertising programs are not considered in the statistic pertaining to the diminished use of cost per click, as it is uncertain if contextual advertising can be considered affiliate marketing.

While these models have diminished in mature e-commerce and online advertising markets they are still prevalent in some more nascent industries. China is one example where Affiliate Marketing does not overtly resemble the same model in the West. With many affiliates being paid a flat &quot;Cost Per Day&quot; with some networks offering Cost Per Click or CPM.

===Performance/affiliate marketing===
In the case of cost per mille/click, the publisher is not concerned about whether a visitor is a member of the audience that the advertiser tries to attract and is able to convert because at this point the publisher has already earned his commission. This leaves the greater, and, in case of cost per mille, the full risk and loss (if the visitor cannot be converted) to the advertiser.

Cost per action/sale methods require that referred visitors do more than visit the advertiser&#x27;s website before the affiliate receives a commission. The advertiser must convert that visitor first. It is in the best interest of the affiliate to send the most closely targeted traffic to the advertiser as possible to increase the chance of a conversion. The risk is absorbed by the affiliate who funnels their traffic to the campaign (normally a landing page). In the case a conversion is not fired the publisher won&#x27;t receive any compensation for the traffic.

Affiliate marketing is also called &quot;performance marketing&quot;, in reference to how sales employees are typically being compensated. Such employees are typically paid a commission for each sale they close, and sometimes are paid performance incentives for exceeding objectives. Affiliates are not employed by the advertiser whose products or services they promote, but the compensation models applied to affiliate marketing are very similar to the ones used for people in the advertisers&#x27; internal sales department.

The phrase, &quot;Affiliates are an extended sales force for your business&quot;, which is often used to explain affiliate marketing, is not completely accurate. The primary difference between the two is that affiliate marketers provide little if any influence on a possible prospect in the conversion process once that prospect is directed to the advertiser&#x27;s website. The sales team of the advertiser, however, does have the control and influence up to the point where the prospect either a) signs the contract, or b) completes the purchase.

==Multi-tier programs==
Affiliate marketing overlaps with network marketing, also known as multi-level marketing (MLM). Multi-level refers to different levels of compensation offered by companies to different tiers of distributor. While MLM schemes are not inherently illegal, they become illegal when income from recruitment-fees and similar exceeds the sale of actual goods and services. In these situations, MLM schemes overlap with pyramid schemes and ponzi schemes.

Some advertisers offer multi-tier programs that distribute commission into a hierarchical referral network of sign-ups and sub-partners. In practical terms, publisher &quot;A&quot; signs up to the program with an advertiser and gets rewarded for the agreed activity conducted by a referred visitor. If publisher &quot;A&quot; attracts publishers &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; to sign up for the same program using his sign-up code, all future activities performed by publishers &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; will result in additional commission (at a lower rate) for publisher &quot;A&quot;.

Two-tier programs exist in the minority of affiliate programs; most are simply one-tier.

==From the advertiser&#x27;s perspective==

===Advantages for merchants===
Merchants favor affiliate marketing because in most cases it uses a &quot;pay for performance&quot; model, meaning that the merchant does not incur a marketing expense unless results are accrued (excluding any initial setup cost).

===Implementation options===
Some merchants run their own (in-house) affiliate programs using dedicated software, while others use third-party intermediaries to track traffic or sales that are referred from affiliates. There are two different types of affiliate management methods used by merchants: standalone software or hosted services, typically called affiliate networks. Payouts to affiliates or publishers can be made by the networks on behalf of the merchant, by the network, consolidated across all merchants where the publisher has a relationship with and earned commissions or directly by the merchant itself.

===Affiliate management and program management outsourcing===

Uncontrolled affiliate programs aid rogue affiliates, who use spamming, trademark infringement, false advertising, cookie stuffing, typosquatting, and other unethical methods that have given affiliate marketing a negative reputation.

Some merchants are using outsourced (affiliate) program management (OPM) companies, which are themselves often run by affiliate managers and network program managers. OPM companies perform affiliate program management for the merchants as a service, similar to the role an advertising agencies serves in offline marketing.

===Types of affiliate websites===

Affiliate websites are often categorized by merchants (advertisers) and affiliate networks. There are currently no industry-wide standards for the categorization. The following types of websites are generic, yet are commonly understood and used by affiliate marketers.
* Search affiliates that utilize pay per click search engines to promote the advertisers&#x27; offers (i.e., search arbitrage)
* Price comparison service websites and directories
* Loyalty websites, typically characterized by providing a reward or incentive system for purchases via points, miles, cash back
* Cause Related Marketing sites that offer charitable donations
* Coupon and rebate websites that focus on sales promotions
* Content and niche market websites, including product review sites
* E-mail marketing list affiliates (i.e., owners of large opt-in -mail lists that typically employ e-mail drip marketing) and newsletter list affiliates, which are typically more content-heavy
* Shopping directories that list merchants by categories without providing coupons, price comparisons, or other features based on information that changes frequently, thus requiring continual updates
* Cost per action networks (i.e., top-tier affiliates) that expose offers from the advertiser with which they are affiliated with their own network of affiliates
* Websites using adbars (e.g. AdSense) to display context-sensitive advertising for products on the site

===Publisher recruitment===
Affiliate networks that already have several advertisers typically also have a large pool of publishers. These publishers could be potentially recruited, and there is also an increased chance that publishers in the network apply to the program on their own, without the need for recruitment efforts by the advertiser.

Relevant websites that attract the same target audiences as the advertiser but without competing with it are potential affiliate partners as well. Vendors or existing customers can also become recruits if doing so makes sense and does not violate any laws or regulations (such as with pyramid schemes).

Almost any website could be recruited as an affiliate publisher, but high traffic websites are more likely interested in (for their sake) low-risk cost per mille or medium-risk cost per click deals rather than higher-risk cost per action or revenue share deals.

==Past and current issues==
Since the emergence of affiliate marketing, there has been little control over affiliate activity. Unscrupulous affiliates have used spam, false advertising, forced clicks (to get tracking cookies set on users&#x27; computers), adware, and other methods to drive traffic to their sponsors. Although many affiliate programs have terms of service that contain rules against spam, this marketing method has historically proven to attract abuse from spammers.

===E-mail spam===
In the infancy of affiliate marketing, many Internet users held negative opinions due to the tendency of affiliates to use spam to promote the programs in which they were enrolled. As affiliate marketing matured, many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming.

===Malicious browser extensions===
A browser extension is a plug-in that extends the functionality of a web browser. Some extensions are authored using web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Most modern web browsers have a whole slew of third-party extensions available for download. In recent years, there has been a constant rise in the number of malicious browser extensions flooding the web. Malicious browser extensions will often appear to be legitimate as they seem to originate from vendor websites and come with glowing customer reviews. 

In the case of affiliate marketing, these malicious extensions are often used to redirect a user&#x27;s browser to send fake clicks to websites that are supposedly part of legitimate affiliate marketing programs. Typically, users are unaware this is happening other than their browser performance slowing down. Websites end up paying for fake traffic numbers, and users are unwitting participants in these ad schemes.

===Search engine spam===
As search engines have become more prominent, some affiliate marketers have shifted from sending e-mail spam to creating automatically generated web pages that often contain product data feeds provided by merchants. The goal of such web pages is to manipulate the relevancy or prominence of resources indexed by a search engine, also known as &quot;spamdexing&quot;. Each page can be targeted to a different niche market through the use of specific keywords, with the result being a skewed form of search engine optimization.

Spam is the biggest threat to organic search engines, whose goal is to provide quality search results for keywords or phrases entered by their users. Google&#x27;s PageRank algorithm update (&quot;BigDaddy&quot;) in February 2006—the final stage of Google&#x27;s major update (&quot;Jagger&quot;) that began in mid-summer 2005—specifically targeted spamdexing with great success. This update thus enabled Google to remove a large amount of mostly computer-generated duplicate content from its index.

Websites consisting mostly of affiliate links have previously held a negative reputation for underdelivering quality content. In 2005 there were active changes made by Google, where certain websites were labeled as &quot;thin affiliates&quot;. Such websites were either removed from Google&#x27;s index or were relocated within the results page (i.e., moved from the top-most results to a lower position). To avoid this categorization, affiliate marketer webmasters must create quality content on their websites that distinguishes their work from the work of spammers or banner farms, which only contain links leading to merchant sites.

===Adware===
Although it differs from spyware, adware often uses the same methods and technologies. Merchants initially were uninformed about adware, what impact it had, and how it could damage their brands. Affiliate marketers became aware of the issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that adware often overwrites tracking cookies, thus resulting in a decline of commissions. Affiliates not employing adware felt that it was stealing commission from them. Adware often has no valuable purpose and rarely provides any useful content to the user, who is typically unaware that such software is installed on his/her computer.

Affiliates discussed the issues in Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed that the best way to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via adware. Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of adware were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants&#x27; reputations and tarnishing their affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor&#x27;s affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban certain adware publishers from their network. The result was Code of Conduct by Commission Junction/beFree and Performics, LinkShare&#x27;s Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum, and ShareASale&#x27;s complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertiser offers. Regardless of the progress made, adware continues to be an issue, as demonstrated by the class action lawsuit against ValueClick and its daughter company Commission Junction filed on April 20, 2007.

===Trademark bidding===
Affiliates were among the earliest adopters of pay per click advertising when the first pay-per-click search engines emerged during the end of the 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, going so far as to allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser&#x27;s trademarks.

===Compensation disclosure===
Bloggers and other publishers may not be aware of disclosure guidelines set forth by the FTC. Guidelines affect celebrity endorsements, advertising language, and blogger compensation.

===Lack of industry standards===

====Certification and training====
Affiliate marketing currently lacks industry standards for training and certification. There are some training courses and seminars that result in certifications; however, the acceptance of such certifications is mostly due to the reputation of the individual or company issuing the certification. Affiliate marketing is not commonly taught in universities, and only a few college instructors work with Internet marketers to introduce the subject to students majoring in marketing.

Education occurs most often in &quot;real life&quot; by becoming involved and learning the details as time progresses. Although there are several books on the topic, some so-called &quot;how-to&quot; or &quot;silver bullet&quot; books instruct readers to manipulate holes in the Google algorithm, which can quickly become out of date, or suggest strategies no longer endorsed or permitted by advertisers.

Outsourced Program Management companies typically combine formal and informal training, providing much of their training through group collaboration and brainstorming. Such companies also try to send each marketing employee to the industry conference of their choice.

====Code of conduct====
A code of conduct was released by affiliate networks Commission Junction/beFree and Performics in December 2002 to guide practices and adherence to ethical standards for online advertising.

===Sales tax vulnerability===
In 2008 the state of New York passed a law asserting sales tax jurisdiction over Amazon.com sales to New York residents. New York was aware of Amazon affiliates operating within the state. In Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, the US Supreme Court ruled that the presence of independent sales representatives may allow a state to require sales tax collections. New York determined that affiliates are such independent sales representatives. The New York law became known as &quot;Amazon&#x27;s law&quot; and was quickly emulated by other states. While that was the first time states successfully addressed the internet tax gap, since 2018 states have been free to assert sales tax jurisdiction over sales to their residents regardless of the presence of retailer affiliates.

===Cookie stuffing===
===Click to reveal===
Many voucher code web sites use a click-to-reveal format, which requires the web site user to click to reveal the voucher code. The action of clicking places the cookie on the website visitor&#x27;s computer. In the United Kingdom, the IAB Affiliate Council under chair Matt Bailey announced regulations that stated that &quot;Affiliates must not use a mechanism whereby users are encouraged to click to interact with content where it is unclear or confusing what the outcome will be.&quot;

<doc id="703764" wikidata="Q7068034" url="?curid=703764" title="Nuclear bag fiber">
<text>A nuclear bag fiber is a type of intrafusal muscle fiber that lies in the center of a muscle spindle. Each has many nuclei concentrated in bags and they cause excitation of the primary sensory fibers.

There are two kinds of bag fibers based upon contraction speed and motor innervation.
#BAG2 fibers are the largest. They have no striations in middle region and swell to enclose nuclei, hence their name.
#BAG1 fibers, smaller than BAG2.

Both bag types extend beyond the spindle capsule.

These sense dynamic length of the muscle. They are sensitive to length and velocity.

<doc id="703767" wikidata="Q4458337" url="?curid=703767" title="Teton River (Idaho)">
<text>The Teton River is a tributary of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River in southeastern Idaho in the United States. It drains through the Teton Valley along the west side of the Teton Range along the Idaho-Wyoming border at the eastern end of the Snake River Plain. Its location along the western flank of the Tetons provides the river with more rainfall than many other rivers of the region.

==History==
At the time of the arrival of the Europeans to the region in the 1820s, the area was inhabited by the Shoshone and various related tribes. The lushness of the Teton Basin provided prime area for the fur trade, attracting many other tribes to region, including the Nez Perce, Flathead and the Gros Ventre. At the time, the basin was part of the disputed Oregon Country. The resulting friction between the trading groups led to recurring skirmishes in the basin. In 1832, a trade rendezvous gone awry resulted in the Battle of Pierre&#x27;s Hole between the Gros Ventre and a party of American trappers, led by William Sublette and aided by their Nez Perce and Flathead allies. In the brief but bloody battle at least twenty-six Gros Ventres were killed, including women and children, and perhaps a dozen whites and Flatheads. Sublette received severe injuries and returned east to the United States for medical care.

The most famous modern incident along the river occurred on June 5, 1976 when the earthen Teton Dam in Teton Canyon collapsed, killing 11 people in the valley below. The force of water due to the dam failure destroyed the lower part of the Teton River, washing away riparian zones and reducing the canyon walls. This seriously damaged the stream ecology, and the native cutthroat trout population has been endangered. The force of the water and excessive sediment also damaged stream habitat in the Snake River and some tributaries.

==Watershed==

The Teton River watershed drains , in Idaho and in Wyoming. The river mainstem is formed near Victor in Teton County, Idaho, near the Wyoming state line, by the confluence of Warm Creek (Trail Creek watershed) and Drake Creek. It is joined by several additional creeks that descend from surrounding Teton, Big Hole, and Snake River mountain ranges. The majority of flows to the Teton River come from tributaries draining the western flank of the Tetons, including Trail, Fox, Teton, and South Leigh creeks. Trail Creek descends along Highway 22 from the Caribou-Targhee National Forest in Idaho, meeting the other creeks from the south. The river flows north in a slow meandering course through a broad flat valley called the Teton Basin (formerly known as &quot;Pierre&#x27;s Hole&quot;), flanked by the Teton Range to the east and the Big Hole Mountains to the west. Much of the river&#x27;s upper course in the Teton Basin is surrounded by extensive wetlands.

After emerging from the north end of the Teton Basin, the Teton River enters the nearly inaccessible Teton Canyon, approximately long, along the Teton-Fremont county line. There it is joined by Badger Creek and Bitch Creek from the east, then turns almost 90 degrees west, and is joined by Canyon Creek from the south. After passing through the failed Teton Dam site, north and east of Newdale, the Teton River bifurcates into two distributaries some four miles downstream, just north of Teton, one called the South Fork Teton River (also called the South Teton River) and the other called North Fork Teton River (also known as the Teton River). The South Teton River travels generally southwest until it joins Henry&#x27;s Fork west of Rexburg at the southwest end of a large inland delta region on the Henry&#x27;s Fork, essentially merging with the delta from the east as one of its channels. The Teton River itself (North Fork Teton) continues to travel west, where it joins the Henrys Fork at Warm Slough near Rexburg, approximately seven miles upstream of the confluence with the Snake River.

==Ecology==
The upper watershed between Victor and Driggs are key targets for restoration by the Friends of Teton River as they harbor the best spawning habitat for Yellowstone cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri&quot;). An Idaho Fish and Game study reported a 95% decline in Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT) while non-native brook trout (&quot;Salvenlinus fontinalis&quot;) and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) populations increased by 300%. The Teton River is considered one of three remaining strongholds for YCT, which currently only survive in 27% of their former range in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Hybridization with nonnative rainbow trout has been the primary factor reducing YCT populations. Other factors include competition with nonnative brook trout and habitat degradation from water diversion, grazing, mining, timber harvest and development.

<text>The University of Staffordshire is a public research university in Staffordshire, England. It has its main campus in Stoke-on-Trent and four other campuses in Stafford, Lichfield, Shrewsbury, and London.

== History ==
In 1901, industrialist Alfred Bolton acquired a site on what is now College Road and in 1906 mining classes began there. In 1907, pottery classes followed, being transferred from Tunstall into temporary buildings, and in 1914 the building now known as the Cadman Building was officially opened as the Central School of Science and Technology by J. A. Pease, President of the Board of Education. A frieze over the entrance depicts potters and miners. In 2013, the Library Conference room in the Cadman Building was renamed the Alfred Bolton Room.

In 1915, a department was established for the commercial production of Seger cones used to measure and control the temperatures of ceramic furnaces, based upon research completed by the principal, Joseph Mellor. Grants from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust in 1924 were used to develop the ceramics library and in 1926 the name of the institution was changed to North Staffordshire Technical College. By 1931 extensions to the Cadman Building ran along Station Road and housed the Mining Department. A grant was awarded from the Miners’ Welfare Fund to fund the building work. The new extension also housed the library, which by now had 35,000 volumes. By 1934 the college consisted of four departments: Engineering (nearly 800 students), Pottery (just over 600 students), Mining (just under 500 students), and Chemistry (under 300 students).

In 1939, new engineering workshops were occupied for the first time and the land opposite the Cadman Building was purchased. By 1950 Victoria Road had been renamed College Road and the site now extended over . The Mellor Building and Experimental Production Block (now Dwight Building) were constructed for the North Staffordshire College of Technology by 1960.

Various faculty movements and further building work resulted in North Staffordshire Polytechnic being formed in 1970 with the merger of Stoke-on-Trent College of Art, North Staffordshire College of Technology (both based in Stoke-on-Trent), and Staffordshire College of Technology in Stafford. In 1977, the polytechnic absorbed Madeley College of Education, formerly County of Stafford Training College, a teacher training facility in Madeley, Staffordshire specialising in physical education.

The polytechnic developed traditional strengths of the component institutions, e.g. ceramics (Stoke-on-Trent), computing (Stafford) and sports education (Madeley). The mining department closed as result of the decline of coal mining in the 1980s. New subjects were developed. North Staffordshire Polytechnic was among only a handful of third-level institutions in the UK to offer International Relations as a dedicated degree. The 1992 UK government Research Assessment Exercise placed the International Relations Department as the highest-rated in the institution.

In 1988, the institution changed its name to Staffordshire Polytechnic. In 1992, it became Staffordshire University, one of the new universities based on former polytechnics.

On 23rd September 2024, the university was rebranded as University of Staffordshire. 

== Campuses ==
The university has one main campus, and four other campuses in Stafford, Lichfield, Shrewsbury and London, and extensive links with national, European and transnational academic institutions.

===Stoke-on-Trent===
The main campus is in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, and primarily offers law, business, sciences, applied computing, engineering, arts, design, games, journalism and media production courses. These are split into two areas, one on College Road (on the site of the former County Cricket Ground), and the other on Leek Road. A Science Centre was opened in 2012 as part of a major redevelopment adjacent to Stoke-on-Trent railway station. In 2022, the University opened a new £42 million building on the Leek Road site - The Catalyst. This 8,800 sqm, four storey building, brought together the delivery of apprenticeships and skills.

The Stoke campus also features its own student nightclub called LRV (Leek Road Venue). This nightclub hosts a variety of student nights on various days of the week but its main open nights are on a Wednesday and Friday.

A public film theatre is situated on the side of the Flaxman building on College Road, which shows mainstream and independent films on a regular basis to an audience of up to 180 people, as well as being used for large lectures. In 2006, a TV studio facility was opened by former BBC Director General Greg Dyke in the Arts, Media and Design faculty building on College Road, Stoke. The £1 million development features up-to-date technology and industry specification equipment.

The Stoke-on-Trent campus is also home to the Sir Stanley Matthews Sports Centre. Named after Stoke City footballer Sir Stanley Matthews CBE, the sports centre is located on Leek Road campus and is open to students, staff and the public.

===Staffordshire University London: Digital Institute ===
Located at Here East in East London, the Digital Institute opened in 2019 and is focused on new and emerging technology, primarily based around Games and Computing courses, key specialisms of the University since the 1960s. In 2021, the university invested £3.5m to increase its footprint to 31,133 sq feet, and allow the provider to expand the range of courses it has on offer for 2022.

===Stafford and Shrewsbury ===
Nursing, midwifery, operating department practice and paramedic science courses are taught at the &quot;Centre of Excellence&quot; in Stafford on Blackheath Lane and at the &quot;Centre for Health Innovation&quot; in Shrewsbury which is situated at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.

In March 2022, the university opened the £5.8 million Centre for Health Innovation.

The new Centre was part-funded by Stoke-on-Trent &amp; Staffordshire Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) via the Government’s Getting Building Fund. The LEP allocated £2.89m to the scheme to help bring forward the pioneering facility and generate further opportunity for learners and businesses in the area.

As well as being the study base for more than 2,000 student nurses, midwives, operating department practitioners and paramedics, the Centre also offers a platform for new collaborations with local business and healthcare and technology industries.

===Lichfield===

In 1998, in partnership with Tamworth and Lichfield College, the university opened a new campus in Lichfield.

===Shrewsbury, Telford, and Oswestry===
This part of the university is mainly for nursing and midwifery courses, and is still part of the university despite all three settlements being located in the neighbouring county of Shropshire.

===Overseas===
The university has many overseas students studying for Staffordshire University awards in Belgium, China, Vietnam, France, Greece, India, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria, Singapore, Spain, and Sri Lanka. The university also conducts a twinning programme with DISTED College in George Town, Penang, Malaysia.

Staffordshire University offers programmes in Hung Yen, Ecopark Township, Vietnam through the British University Vietnam. The university has a strong partnership with the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.

===Halls of residence===
The university offers guaranteed accommodation for all first-year students, provided the university is their firm UCAS choice. All accommodation is situated close to all teaching, sporting, and Union venues.

====Stafford====
The Stafford campus has its own halls of residence, Stafford Court, comprising over 264 en-suite single study bedrooms and 290 single study bedrooms with shared facilities. The various houses take their names from villages in Staffordshire: Brocton, Derrington, Eccleshall, Gnosall, Haughton, Knightley, Levedale, Milwich, Norbury, Ranton, Shugborough and Weston.

A separate block of larger flats, named after the village of Yarlet (previously Beckett Hall), is also on the same site. This comprises an additional 51 single-study bedrooms over three floors, each accommodating 17 residents, who share a kitchen, dining room and four shower rooms. All of these halls are directly opposite the Stafford campus buildings on Weston Road.

By September 2016 only the midwifery, nursing, paramedic science, operation department practitioners and other allied and public health courses will remain at the Blackheath Lane site (Stafford) with the rest moved to Stoke.

====Stoke====
At Stoke, halls of residence are primarily situated on the Leek Road campus. The shared-bathroom accommodation was sponsored by various local potteries, and halls are therefore named after them, for example Royal Doulton, Coalport, Mintons, Spode, Aynsley and Wedgwood halls.

The on-campus en-suite accommodation is contained within Clarice Cliff Court, comprising seven halls, each of about 30 students over three floors, each hall named after female ceramicists: Rachel Bishop, Eve Midwinter, Jessie van Hallen, Charlotte Rhead, Jessie Tait, Millicent Taplin and Star Wedgwood. Along with the halls and en-suite, the university also offers 32 houses, known as the Leek Road Houses, each of which accommodates up to 6 people each.

Carlton House, Etruscan House, Caledonia Road, Queen Anne Street Flats, Cromwell Court, Church Street and Sovereign House are situated off campus. They are all within of the Stoke Campus, and are reserved for postgraduate and returning (second and third year) students.

The Shelton area of Stoke is where many students choose to live after their first year. The proximity of Shelton to the university and the large quantity of student accommodation has effectively turned it into a mini-student village. Alternatively, there are also the College Court Halls, which are privately run but operate in a similar way to university-run halls. They are situated opposite Hanley Park and are close to the university.

== Organisation ==
The university restructured in 2021 and has now three academic schools, alongside the Institute of Education and Staffordshire University London.

* School of Digital, Technology and Arts
* School of Health, Science and Wellbeing
* School of Justice, Security and Sustainability
* Institute of Education
* Staffordshire University London

===Staffordshire University Services===

As of 1 April 2021, all new academic and professional services staff are employed by Staffordshire University Services - which the University describes as &#x27;a wholly owned subsidiary company of Staffordshire University&#x27;. Staff employed by Staffordshire University Services have no access to the defined benefit Teachers&#x27; Pension Scheme and instead join a new defined contribution scheme that does not guarantee a set level of income in retirement.

The University and College Union claimed that this would create a &quot;two tier workforce&quot;.

In March 2022, Almost three-quarters (70 per cent) of staff backed strike action over the matter.

== Academic profile ==

The School of Computing was originally situated at Blackheath Lane on the edge of Stafford in GEC&#x27;s former Nelson Research Laboratory. It offered one of the first BSc courses in computing in the United Kingdom and its first major computer was a second hand DEUCE. The School of Computing later moved to a purpose-built building on the Beaconside campus, the Octagon, constructed in 1992 when university status had been achieved.
The university was the first institution to introduce a single honours degree in Film, Television and Radio Studies in 1990. A new Media Centre was opened by Greg Dyke in 2005, comprising radio studios, television news desk and broadcast journalist suite. Courses in print, broadcast and sports journalism are nationally accredited by the National Council for the Training of Journalists and the Broadcast Journalism Training Council.

The Forensic Science degrees (Forensic Science, Forensic Science and Criminology and Forensic Science and Psychology) were accredited by the Forensic Science Society (FSC) in 2007, one of four universities whose courses have been acknowledged for teaching services and high academic quality. The Forensic theme is continued with a specialist Forensic Biology degree and on the Stafford Campus the Faculty of Computing Engineering and Technology was one of the first university faculties in the UK to offer undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the new field of Forensic Computing.

===League table rankings===

The university&#x27;s world ranking is 1,354 in 2010, according to webometrics.info.

== Student life ==

=== Students&#x27; Union ===
Staffordshire University Students&#x27; Union aims to represent students at the university. Constitutionally it is governed by the student body, who annually elect a student council which is responsible for the organisation of the Union. The day-to-day operation of the union is handled by four Sabbatical Officers and four student trustees, who are held to account by the Council. All officer positions, bar the four sabbatical officers, work on a part-time basis.

=== Sports ===
Since 2007, Staffordshire University (Stoke Campus) and Keele University have engaged in an annual varsity match. In 2013 Staffordshire University (Stafford Campus) and Wolverhampton University engaged in an annual varsity match. In 2021, the university tied up with Indian Super League club Odisha FC under the later&#x27;s Education and Community partnership Program

<doc id="703769" wikidata="Q7803276" url="?curid=703769" title="Tim Canterbury">
<text>Tim Canterbury is a fictional character in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Office&quot;, portrayed by Martin Freeman. He is a sales representative at the Slough branch of Wernham Hogg Paper Merchants. He has a self-deprecating and ironic sense of humour.

Tim flirts with, and feels great attraction to, the receptionist Dawn Tinsley. His office nemesis is Gareth Keenan, with whom he regularly exchanges insults and on whom he frequently plays practical jokes. His relationship with his boss David Brent is mixed; at times Tim seems to get along well with David, and often patiently humours Brent&#x27;s attempts at comedy and social interaction. However, like the other employees, he is often exasperated by Brent&#x27;s more extreme personality flaws.

In many ways, he is Brent&#x27;s complete opposite. While Brent tends to alienate people with his constant displays of arrogance and insecurities, Tim is liked by almost everyone due largely to his kindness, his cheeky-chappy sense of humour and his caring nature. However, he lives an unsatisfying life – at thirty, he still lives with his parents and works in a job for which he has no passion or interest. Having dropped out of university after a year, he hopes to return and earn a Psychology degree, but his hidden insecurity prevents him from doing so. His regular pranks on Gareth are one of his ways of maintaining his sanity.

At the end of the first season, Tim abandons his plan to quit his office job and return to university to earn a degree in Psychology. He reveals to Dawn that David Brent has &quot;promoted&quot; him to Senior Sales Clerk, which includes a raise of £500. As Tim relays this information, he begins speaking in a distinctly Brent-esque style, using vague syllogisms and empty phrases with no clear meaning behind them. He also backpedals on a lot of the career advice he previously gave to Dawn and suggests that his new title has set him upon a more desirable path.

In the second series, although Tim retains much of his former ironic humour, much of his self-deprecation is absent. Despite his promotion being little more than tokenistic, he takes his job much more seriously, and insists that others do the same. This suggests a potential parallel between Tim and David Brent in terms of their career trajectory: the casual and flippant attitude being discarded upon receiving a taste of authority, however insignificant, and buying into the corporate, pencil-pushing mentality.

Tim&#x27;s equivalent in the American version of &quot;The Office&quot; is Jim Halpert. His French equivalents are Paul Delorme (played by Jeremie Elkaim) and Louis Tremblay.

==Relationship with Dawn Tinsley==
Apart from being her colleague and close friend, Tim harbours strong feelings for Dawn. Their relationship is very flirtatious at times. However, Dawn&#x27;s engagement to Lee prevents them from becoming more than friends for quite some time. Their friendship seems to suffer after the episode &quot;Training Day&quot;, in which Dawn and Lee are having problems. Tim consoles her throughout the episode, but mistakenly comes to the conclusion that Lee and Dawn have split. He then asks Dawn out on a date in front of everyone, where she tells him that she and Lee are still together. Humiliated, Tim insists he was just asking her out as a friend.

During the second series, Dawn and Tim remain friends, but do not seem to be as close anymore. Tim starts to take his job more seriously after being promoted and becomes somewhat distant toward Dawn at first. Tim also begins to date Rachel, one of the former Swindon employees, and Dawn grows jealous (along with Gareth, who claims he had feelings for Rachel before Tim and doesn&#x27;t understand why she wants to go out with someone who looks like a Fisher Price Man). In the fifth episode of the second series, Dawn is selling kisses for Red Nose Day. After Tim makes a contribution, they share a kiss. Tim is then driven to choose between Rachel and Dawn, unaware of Dawn and Lee&#x27;s plans to move to the United States. In the next episode he makes his decision, breaking up with Rachel. Tim soon discovers that Dawn is leaving for Florida with Lee. Initially Tim seems reluctant to say anything, but changes his mind during an interview with the camera crew and runs to tell Dawn how he feels. Their conversation is kept private as Tim takes off his mic, but he emerges unsuccessful and admits Dawn said no. The second series ends with both Dawn and Tim depressed.

Three years pass, with Tim remaining complacent in his job at Wernham Hogg and Dawn living unhappily with Lee in Florida. Dawn and Lee are flown back for the reunion, and she resumes her friendship with Tim briefly. When Dawn receives a Christmas present from Tim encouraging her to hold on to her dream of becoming an illustrator, she returns to the Christmas party without Lee, where she and Tim kiss and finally become a couple.

<doc id="703770" wikidata="Q1149857" url="?curid=703770" title="Shiira">
<text>Shiira (シイラ, Japanese for the common dolphin-fish) is a discontinued open source web browser for the Mac OS X operating system. According to its lead developer Makoto Kinoshita, the goal of Shiira was &quot;to create a browser that is better and more useful than Safari&quot;. Shiira used WebKit for rendering and scripting. The project reached version 2.3 before it was discontinued, and by December 2011 the developer&#x27;s website had been removed.

==Features and performance==
Since the browser was developed with Safari in mind, the main characteristics of the two browsers are similar. For example, Shiira employs private browsing options so that history and cookies are not recorded when activated. However, the search engines search field on the toolbar includes many search engines. Shiira also uses Cocoa programming to provide users with a customizable drawer extending from the left or right of the window. The drawer includes bookmarks, history, downloads, and an RSS reader. In version 2.0, the sidebar was replaced by a series of palettes opened and closed from the main window toolbar. Shiira natively supports in-browser PDF viewing.

==Style==
The features of Shiira included appearance options. Users could switch between Aqua or Metal styles in addition to changing the buttons&#x27; appearances. However, in the 2.0 release, changes in themes were not available. Tabs were also customizable. Another option was &quot;Tab Exposé&quot;, which acted much like the Exposé feature of Mac OS X; each tab was visible in its totality, enabling users to select the tab to which they wished to navigate. The 1.x releases of Shiira also had a page-turning effect for transitions between any two webpages; however, this was dropped from 2.x releases. The interface in Shiira 2.0 could be set to display tabs as thumbnails along the bottom or sides of the window.

==Versions==
The latest release (version 2.3) requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. Shiira 2.3 has not been tested on the latest versions of the OS, and has been reported to be buggy on Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6. The final release for Mac OS X 10.3 was 1.2.2.

<doc id="703772" wikidata="Q7068038" url="?curid=703772" title="Nuclear chain fiber">
<text>A nuclear chain fiber is a specialized sensory organ contained within a muscle. Nuclear chain fibers are intrafusal fibers that, along with nuclear bag fibers, make up the muscle spindle responsible for the detection of changes in muscle length.

There are 3–9 nuclear chain fibers per muscle spindle that are half the size of the nuclear bag fibers. Their nuclei are aligned in a chain and they excite the secondary nerve. They are static, whereas the nuclear bag fibers are dynamic in comparison. The name &quot;nuclear chain&quot; refers to the structure of the central region of the fiber, where the sensory axons wrap around the intrafusal fibers.

The secondary nerve association involves an efferent and afferent pathway that measure the stress and strain placed on the muscle (usually the extrafusal fibers connected from the muscle portion to a bone). The afferent pathway resembles a spring wrapping around the nuclear chain fiber and connecting to one of its ends away from the bone. Again, depending on the stress and strain the muscles sustains, this afferent and efferent coordination will measure the &quot;stretch of the spring&quot; and communicate the results to the central nervous system.

A similar structure attaching one end to muscle and the other end to a tendon is known as a Golgi tendon organ. However, Golgi tendon organs differ from nuclear chain and nuclear bag fibers in that they are considered in series rather than in parallel to the muscle fibers.

==Innervation==
As intrafusal muscle fibers, nuclear chain fibers are innervated by both sensory afferents and motor efferents. The afferent innervation is via type Ia sensory fibers and type II sensory fibers. These project to the nucleus proprius in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Efferent innervation is via static γ motor neurons. Stimulation of γ neurons causes the nuclear chain to shorten along with the extrafusal muscle fibers. This shortening allows the nuclear chain fiber to be sensitive to changes in length while its corresponding muscle is contracted.

<text>Teesside University is a public university with its main campus in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire in North East England. It was officially opened as &quot;Constantine Technical College&quot; in 1930, before becoming a polytechnic in 1969, and finally granted university status in 1992 by the Privy Council.

The university has over 22,500 students studying in the UK, according to the 2021/22 HESA student record.

== History ==
A shortage of funding long proved a barrier to developing the Middlesbrough-based Mechanics&#x27; Institute of 1844. With the required funding, the college&#x27;s launch could have come as early as 1914. Even after the donation of £40,000 to build the college from local shipping magnate Joseph Constantine in 1916, progress was slow. A Governing Council took place in 1922, followed by a doubling of the original financial offer by the Constantine family in 1924. For the task of constructing the first technical college building, Graham R. Dawbarn (a London architect also responsible for additions to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge) was appointed on 29 March 1926. Building work began in 1927, culminating in the beginning of enrolment and teaching on 16 September 1929.

Constantine Technical College was formally opened on 2 July 1930 by the future King Edward VIII, the Prince of Wales. Although not yet a university, Constantine was a further and higher education college from the outset. Students at Constantine could be as young as 15. Degree courses, published in the college&#x27;s prospectus were validated by the University of London. Disciplines included metallurgy, engineering and chemistry. Five rooms were also reserved for an art department, until cramped accommodation forced the School of Art to split from its parent site for the 1950s.
The 1960s were years of sweeping change. By the end of the decade the first two &quot;Teesside University&quot; campaigns had begun: the first, from the early 1960s to 1966, and the second, from 1967 to 1972. Spates of enthusiasm were killed off on each occasion by the scepticism of then-Minister of Education, Anthony Crosland, and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s defining white paper, respectively. The latter effectively shelved plans for the erection of any new institution in the United Kingdom, until the 1980s at least.

On campus, one of the most visible major developments for the college was an extension in 1963 which featured an 11-storey &quot;skyscraper&quot;. The college also acquired the neighbouring former High School of 1877. The college briefly restyled itself as &quot;Constantine College of Technology&quot;, before becoming &quot;Teesside Polytechnic&quot; (Britain&#x27;s 13th Polytechnic) in 1969. At that point, the institution ran seventeen degree courses.

A merger with Teesside College of Education took place in the 1970s along with the purchase of Flatts Lane. The Clarendon Building was added in 1973, as was the Stephenson Building in 1976. Both of these buildings remained in use for the Polytechnic&#x27;s long-awaited conversion into a university. That happened on 16 June 1992, when Teesside Polytechnic became the University of Teesside, one of the UK&#x27;s first new universities following that year&#x27;s Further and Higher Education Act.

By the 1990s, the institution had almost 8,000 students. In 1997 the old Polytechnic&#x27;s library was replaced with a Learning Resource Centre. Subsequent additions included the Virtual Reality Centre and Centre for Enterprise, and later, the Phoenix and Athena Buildings by CPMG Architects. Today, historic structures such as the old High School (the Waterhouse building), the Constantine building and Victoria Building of 1891 (a schoolyard-equipped Victorian school, housing a series of graduate business incubator units), are all Grade II listed buildings.

In 2009, the University of Teesside changed its name to &quot;Teesside University&quot;. It also changed its logo and adopted the motto &quot;Inspiring success&quot; as part of a £20,000 rebrand. Alternative names included &quot;Middlesbrough University&quot; and &quot;Tees Valley University&quot;.

On 15 October 2009, Teesside was named University of the Year and awarded &quot;Outstanding Employer Engagement Initiative&quot; in the Times Higher Education Awards.

In 2010, the £17 million Centuria South building for dental training and sports therapy was opened. This continues to provide specialist facilities. A major phase of development known as campus Heart began in 2014. This £22 million landmark development created a central focus to the Middlesbrough campus. It also brought The Curve, a new £20 million teaching building. As part of this £280 million investment period, a &quot;living wall&quot; was created around a giant plasma screen on the side of the university&#x27;s Student Centre. In September 2017, the university unveiled a £300 million &quot;campus masterplan&quot; set to &quot;transform its campus&quot; across the following decade.

In March 2021, the university and the Tees Valley Mayor and Combined Authority announced the development of the £13.5 million Net Zero Industry Innovation Centre (NZIIC). Located at Middlesbrough&#x27;s Tees Advanced Manufacturing Park (TeesAMP), the facility will support the region&#x27;s ongoing drive for clean energy and sustainability.

In August 2024, some buildings on the campus were damaged during the 2024 United Kingdom riots.

== Campuses and buildings==
===Middlesbrough===

Since its formation as Constantine Technical College in 1930, Teesside University has been located in the borough of Middlesbrough in the North Yorkshire area of England on the south banks of the River Tees. Transport links exist through the A19 and A66 roads. The university&#x27;s main entrance is at the site of the old Constantine College building, fronted by the Waterhouse clock tower.

The Campus Heart was developed at the Middlesbrough campus in 2015. This £30 million development began in 2014 and includes the £20 million Curve building, which has a 200-seat lecture theatre and of teaching and learning space. It sits within a pedestrianised and landscaped area which is seen as a focal point to the campus.

In 2015, £6 million was spent on the refurbishment and extension of the university&#x27;s Orion Building – this includes a three-storey glass extension to house new, industry-standard equipment. It was announced in August 2015, that a further £2.5 million is to be spent on the Students&#x27; Union, and £2 million on campus catering facilities. The library is also expected to see a £5 million investment.

A £2.5 million health and fitness centre opened at Teesside University&#x27;s Middlesbrough campus in January 2016.

£300 million is set to be spent on the university&#x27;s campus between 2017 and 2027.
====Student accommodation====
Teesside University provides accommodation in self-catered rooms which are mostly reserved for first year undergraduate students. Accommodation is also available for international students, postgraduates, staff and undergraduates.

The university has a range of managed residences (halls, houses and flats). Further places are available through the university managed housing scheme (properties owned by private landlords but managed by the university).

In 2015, the university acquired Teesside Central, adding 75 en-suite apartments to its accommodation portfolio. This accommodation is known as Central Halls.

===Art gallery===
Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, or MIMA, is a contemporary art gallery in the centre of Middlesbrough, run in partnership with Teesside University.

===Darlington===

The university opened its original Darlington campus in the former Eastbourne Secondary School in the Eastbourne area of Darlington. A new £13 million Darlington campus opened in 2011 at Central Park. Today the Darlington campus is known as the Centre for Professional and Executive Development (CPED).

===London===
The university opened a London campus in the Here East complex (the former Olympic media centre) near the Hackney Wick area of London in 2023.

== Academic profile ==

Teesside University has won seven National Teaching Fellowships.

The Vice-Chancellor is Professor Paul Croney OBE, who took up the position in May 2015 when Professor Graham Henderson retired. In April 2005, the university welcomed Lord Sawyer as its Chancellor, succeeding the university&#x27;s first ever Chancellor, European Commissioner Leon Brittan.

Teesside University&#x27;s academic schools include: the School of Arts &amp; Creative Industries; the School of Computing, Engineering &amp; Digital Technologies; the School of Health &amp; Life Sciences; the School of Social Sciences, Humanities &amp; Law; and Teesside University International Business School.

===Research===
Teesside University&#x27;s research is focused on addressing three core areas: net zero, health and wellbeing, and people and place.

In the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021, which assesses the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, the majority of the research undertaken by Teesside University was judged to be world-leading or internationally excellent in terms of the social, economic and cultural impact it delivers.

In research, the university offers an array of routes of study resulting in the qualification of MPhil, PhD, MProf and DProf.

==Student life==
The Students&#x27; Union is led by students for students with three current students elected by the student body to hold the positions of President Education, President Activities and President Welfare in March of each year. They take their posts from July to the end of June each year and have the option to seek re-election for a second and final term if they wish. As the officer trustees they sit on a wider board of trustees who oversee the running of the Students&#x27; Union which also includes external trustees drawn from the worlds of local government, business, charity and the public sector.

The Students&#x27; Union won the 2007 &quot;It&#x27;s Not Funny&quot; competition, winning a live comedy performance featuring Bill Bailey, Marcus Brigstocke, Andrew Maxwell and Simon Amstell. More recently the SU was shortlisted for NUS Students&#x27; Union of the Year in 2014.

From 2014 the Students&#x27; Union has received over £8.5 million to refurbish its building and facilities.

=== Cancelled film screening ===

Conservative Party candidate and filmmaker John Walsh made a film of the 2010 General Election entitled &quot;ToryBoy The Movie&quot; in 2011. The film&#x27;s re-release in 2015 caused controversy after it was not shown at Teesside University. According to the film-maker, the film was booked by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was abruptly halted. The Student Union said the booking was never confirmed. The North Crowd featured an interview with John Walsh on their website where they showed the actual print work that was created by the Student Union

<doc id="703780" wikidata="Q831589" url="?curid=703780" title="Dactyls (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Dactyls or Daktyloi (; from &quot;Dáktuloi&quot; &quot;fingers&quot;) were the archaic mythical race of male beings associated with the Great Mother, whether as Cybele or Rhea. Their numbers vary, but often they were ten spirit-men so like the three Korybantes or the Cabeiri that they were often interchangeable. The Dactyls were both ancient smiths and healing magicians. In some myths, they are in Hephaestus&#x27; employ, and they taught metalworking, mathematics, and the alphabet to humans.

When Ankhiale knew her time of delivery was come, she went to the Idaean Cave on Mount Ida or, alternatively, Psychro Cave on the Lasithi Plateau. As she squatted in labor she dug her fingers into the earth (Gaia), which brought forth these &quot;daktyloi Idaioi&quot; ( &quot;Idaean fingers&quot;), thus often ten in number, or sometimes multiplied into a race of ten tens. Three is just as often given as their number. They are sometimes instead numbered as thirty-three.

When Greeks offered a most solemn oath, often they would press their hands against the earth as they uttered it.

==Idaean Dactyls==

The Dactyls of Mount Ida in Crete invented the art of working metals into usable shapes with fire; Walter Burkert surmises that, as the societies of lesser gods mirrored actual cult associations, guilds of smiths corresponded to the &quot;daktyloi&quot; in real life. According to Hesiod, they also discovered iron in Crete. Three Phrygian Dactyls, in the service of the Great Mother as Adraste (), are usually named Acmon (the anvil), Damnameneus (the hammer), and Celmis (casting). Of Celmis, Ovid (in &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; iv) made a story that when Rhea was offended at this childhood companion of Zeus, she asked Zeus to turn him to diamond-hard adamant, like a tempered blade. Zeus obliged. Zenobius wrote that Celmis was turned into iron when he offended Rhea.

Later Greek attempts to justify and rationalize the relationships of Dactyls, Curetes, and Corybantes were never fully successful. Strabo says of the mythographers:

&quot;And they suspect that both the Kouretes and the Korybantes were offspring of the &quot;Daktyloi Idaioi&quot;; at any rate, the first hundred men born in Crete were called Idaian Daktyloi, they say, and these were born of nine Kouretes, for each of these begot ten children who were called Idaian Daktyloi.&quot;

The Cabeiri (), whose sacred place was on the island of Samothrace, were understood by Diodorus Siculus to have been Idaean dactyls who had come west from Phrygia and whose magical practices had made local converts to their secret cult.

An Idaean dactyl named Herakles (perhaps the earliest embodiment of the later hero) originated the Olympic Games by instigating a race among his four &quot;finger&quot; brothers. This Herakles was the &quot;thumb&quot;; his brothers were Aeonius (forefinger), Epimedes (middle finger), Iasus (ring finger/healing finger), and Idas or Acesidas (little finger).

==Rhodian Dactyls==

On Rhodes, Telchines were the name given to similar chthonic men, nine in number, remembered by Greeks as dangerous Underworld smiths and magicians, and multiplied into an entire autochthonous race that had reared Poseidon but had been supplanted by Apollo in his Helios role.

==Cretan Dactyls==

In Crete, three Dactyls bore names suggestive of healing: Paionios (later associated with Asclepius), Epimedes, and Iasios. It was said that they had introduced the smithing of copper and iron. Of Iasion it was told (Hesiod, &quot;Theogony&quot; 970) that he lay with Demeter, a stand-in for Rhea, in a thrice-ploughed field and the Goddess brought forth Ploutos, &quot;wealth&quot;, in the form of a bountiful harvest. Zeus struck down this impious archaic figure with a thunderbolt. This is all of the public version of this myth that survives. Doubtless, initiates must have known more.

<text>The University of West London (UWL) is a public research university in the United Kingdom with campuses in Ealing, Brentford, and Reading, Berkshire.

The university has roots in 1860 when the Lady Byron School was founded, later Ealing College of Higher Education. In 1992, the then-named Polytechnic of West London became a university as Thames Valley University (TVU). 18 years later, after several mergers, acquisitions and campus moves, it was renamed to its current name.

The University of West London comprises nine schools: The Claude Littner Business School, the London Geller College of Hospitality and Tourism, the School of Computing and Engineering, the London College of Music, the College of Nursing, Midwifery and Healthcare, the School of Law, the School of Human and Social Sciences, the School of Biomedical Sciences and the London School of Film, Media and Design.

== History ==

The University of West London traces its roots back to 1860 when the Lady Byron School was founded at what is now the University of West London&#x27;s Ealing campus. The school later became Ealing College of Higher Education.

The Slough campus was founded in January 1912 as a selective secondary school on William Street. By the 1960s, it had become Slough College of Further Education. In the 1960’s the St Mary’s Road site was known as Ealing Technical College, offering CNAA degrees in law (and others). In the 1980s it became Thames Valley College of Higher Education but was closed in 2011.

In 1991, Ealing College of Higher Education, Thames Valley College of Higher Education, Queen Charlotte&#x27;s College of Health Care Studies and the London College of Music were merged to become the Polytechnic of West London. Two years later, the polytechnic became a university under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 and adopted the name Thames Valley University (TVU). In 1994, the university merged with Northwick Park School of Nursing, Riverside College of Nursing and the North West Thames Regional Authority&#x27;s AIDS unit. In 1995, it merged with the Berkshire College of Nursing and Midwifery.

In 2004, the university merged with Reading College and School of Arts and Design, which had been founded in 1947 as Reading Technical College. Reading College&#x27;s sites at Kings Road and Crescent Road became TVU sites.

In 2009, the university decided to divest itself of its further education courses, together with its Kings Road site that it had inherited from the Reading College and School of Arts and Design. In May 2009, the university announced that it would be closing its Slough campus in 2010 due to the relocation of nursing students, who make up the majority of the student body there, to Reading. Other courses would be moved to one of the university&#x27;s Greater London campuses. In July 2009, the university was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for outstanding achievement and excellence in hospitality education.

In 2010 the responsibility for further education, along with the Kings Road site, was transferred to a relaunched Reading College. Although some 40 miles west of London, the university retained its other sites in Reading, including the Crescent Road site that also originated with Reading College and the School of Arts and Design.

In August 2010, it was announced that the university would change its name to the University of West London, with the Privy Council subsequently granting permission for the change. The university unveiled a new logo in April 2011. Vice-chancellor Peter John stated that the changes reflected the university&#x27;s development since 1992 and a new focus on its Brentford and Ealing campuses.

In 2015, a £100m expansion of the Ealing campus was completed. This work included new facilities such as a new library, student union and updated teaching facilities - building which was highly unpopular with many of the locals.

In 2019 the university merged with Drama Studio London in Ealing, and in 2021 it merged with Ruskin College, Oxford.

== Campuses ==

There are two campus sites in western Greater London, located at St Mary&#x27;s Road, Ealing and Paragon House in Brentford. There is also a third site in Reading, Berkshire, which is some from the Ealing sites.

In 2015, the St Mary&#x27;s Road, Ealing campus underwent a £100m transformation, with a new social area, library, student union, gym and updated facilities. In 2017, a further £1m was invested in the development of the Paragon campus in Brentford and the addition of a nursing simulation centre in the Reading campus.

The Ealing campus is home to The Heathrow Archive, a collection of more than 800 artefacts that tell the story of Heathrow Airport&#x27;s history from 1946 to 2016.

== Ras Al Khaimah campus ==
In 2017 The University of West London launched it&#x27;s overseas branch campus in Ras Al Khaimah , United Arab Emirates.

== Organisation ==
The University of West London comprises nine schools: The Claude Littner Business School, the London Geller College of Hospitality and Tourism, the School of Computing and Engineering, the London College of Music, the College of Nursing, Midwifery and Healthcare, the School of Law, the School of Human and Social Sciences, the School of Biomedical Sciences, and the London School of Film, Media and Design.

The Graduate School (based in Ealing) coordinates and provides support to research activities and research degree courses. The University offers traditional PhD programmes and Professional Doctorates.

The university also works with the Met Film School, a private film school that is based at Ealing Studios in London, United Kingdom. The school, which launched in 2003, offers two and three-year bachelor&#x27;s programmes as well as various master&#x27;s degree programmes, which are accredited through the University of West London.

==Academic reputation==

===Academic rankings===
The new Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018 rankings placed the University of West London in 56th place nationally on 24 September 2017, thus putting UWL in the top half of UK universities. On 5 September 2020, The University of West London was ranked 34th best university (out of 130+ institutions) in the UK by the 2021 edition of the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.

In the 2015 edition of the major rankings of British universities the university was placed 97th out of 116 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; university guide, and in 2017 the University had risen to the position of 58th. By 2021, the university had risen to 34th and the university was named the top modern university in London in The Guardian University Guide 2022. 

The University of West London (UWL) is ranked 801-1000 in the Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024 that evaluates universities worldwide based on their contributions to the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, within specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UWL achieved the following rankings: 101-200 for Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10), 301-400 for Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), and 801-1000 for both Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17). 

The University of West London has recorded the best results of any university in Greater London in the annual National Student Survey (NSS) in 2016, with students&#x27; responses showing it to be the best University in Greater London for student satisfaction. In the NSS 2016, there were 100 per cent overall satisfaction rates for nine courses across the University&#x27;s eight schools, ranging from Midwifery to Business Studies and Music Technology to Hospitality Management. Among these 100 per cent overall satisfaction rates, the University recorded the best overall satisfaction rates in the UK for Civil Engineering and Building courses in the NSS 2016. In 2021, UWL was named the university of the year for student experience in The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.

===Teaching standards===
In 2009, the university was the only university to win the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for outstanding achievement and excellence in hospitality education – and it regularly wins awards from major industry bodies. University of West London Careers and Employment Service is a member of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services and has previously been awarded the Matrix Standard for Quality.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===

The University of West London Students&#x27; Union (UWLSU) is the recognised student organisation of the University of West London. It was ranked Number 1 in London and Number 3 in the UK for the NSS for the last 5 years. UWLSU is affiliated with the National Union of Students.

The union has the ground floor of the North Building at the St. Mary&#x27;s Road campus and is home to their cafe - Coffee Union and their social space - Freddie&#x27;s. The Sports Centre is also located on the Park Road entrance of the St. Mary&#x27;s Road campus which is open exclusively to UWL staff, students, alumni, and residents that live within the local area. The union also have a space on the second floor at the Paragon campus and a third space on the 9th floor at the Reading campus.

The union aims to bring students academic advice and advocacy support, events, ways to take up new activities, and sports, and a place to socialise. With the course representative programme run by their Student Voice team, students can apply to be a course or school representative to help advocate for academic change.

===Student accommodation===
Before 2006, the university operated halls of residence only at the Reading campus, although several private houses in the Ealing area were rented by the university and allocated to students studying there. In September 2006 the university began to offer halls of residence accommodation to students from the Ealing and Slough campuses at a student and keyworker accommodation site named Paragon. The site won the &#x27;Major Housing Project of the Year&#x27; category at the 2007 Building Awards, and is in Brentford, approximately two miles away from the Ealing campus.

Paragon is home to the tallest building to be completed using modern methods of construction (MMC) in the UK, which serves as a academic facility for the university&#x27;s human sciences facility. The student accommodation at Paragon had been criticised by its residents for being too expensive, costing the highest of all Greater London universities&#x27; halls of residence along with SOAS in the 2007–2008 year. TVU defended the costs, asserting that the halls are of an especially high standard.

In 2020, Notting Hill Genesis, the company that owned the Paragon student lets site, controversially closed the entire student halls of residence due to fire safety concerns, asking students to immediately evacuate. Students were moved to temporary housing in nearby Wembley whilst the university found suitable housing. Accommodation for students at UWL now varies from shared housing to student lets in Ealing, Acton and the surrounding area.

== Controversies ==

In the mid-1990s, its high-profile vice-chancellor, Mike Fitzgerald, ushered through a networked &quot;New Learning Environment&quot; for undergraduate students, involving a shift to online delivery and assessment. The NLE was discontinued in this form, and Fitzgerald resigned in 1998 following a negative Quality Assurance Agency report stating there were &quot;significant management failures&quot; in the delivery of this model. The University suffered severe financial shortfalls in the years that followed.

<text>:&quot;This is about a French musical duo of Bertrand Cantat and Pascal Humbert. For the American city, see Detroit. For the US spinoff of rock group The Detroit Wheels, see Detroit (band)&quot;

Détroit is a French musical duo formed in 2012 by French rock musician Bertrand Cantat and French bass player Pascal Humbert. Pascal Humbert was part of the rock formation Passion Fodder from 1985 to 1991 before they split up and Cantat established his own famous band Noir Désir, whereas Humbert went on to join the American band 16 Horsepower, and later to Lilium and Wovenhand, amongst others.

The duo Détroit released their greatly expected début album &quot;Horizons&quot; on 18 November 2013. It was recorded in Vega Studios and produced by Pascal Humbert and Bruno Green. The début release from the album is &quot;Droit dans le soleil&quot; that appeared in the SNEP Top 10 in its first week of release. It has also charted in Belgium&#x27;s French records market and in Switzerland.

The formation of the duo follows the break up of Cantat&#x27;s band Noir Désir in 2010. The two collaborated in 2011 in the album &quot;Chœurs&quot; with musicians Bernard Falaise and Alexander MacSween. The music was composed for Wajdi Mouawad&#x27;s production of a trilogy from Sophocles titled &quot;Le Cycle des Femmes: Trois histoires de Sophocle&quot; or just &quot;Des Femmes&quot;.

<doc id="703787" wikidata="Q1508143" url="?curid=703787" title="Ukrainian State">
<text>The Ukrainian State (), sometimes also called the Second [[Cossack Hetmanate|Hetmanate]] (), was an anti-Bolshevik government that existed on most of the modern territory of Ukraine (except for Western Ukraine) from 29 April to 14 December 1918.

It was installed by German military authorities after the socialist-leaning Central Council of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was dispersed on 28 April 1918. The Ukrainian State was governed by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the hetman of all Ukraine, who outlawed all socialist-oriented political parties, creating an anti-Bolshevik front with the Russian State. It collapsed in December 1918, when Skoropadskyi was deposed and the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic returned to power in the form of the Directorate.

== History ==
=== Background ===

As a result of the Bolshevik aggression, the government of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic that initially pursued anti-military policy sought military support after the capital Kyiv was sacked on 9 February 1918, by Mikhail Muravyov. On 9 February, Ukraine signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the coalition of the Central Powers and by March all Bolshevik forces of the Russian SFSR were removed from the territory of Ukraine. The German Army Group Kyiv was created in order to protect Ukraine from further Bolshevik aggression and headed by the German field marshal Hermann von Eichhorn.

=== Hetman Coup ===
On 25 April, the administration of Army Group Kyiv suspected the government of Vsevolod Holubovych of kidnapping of , the chairman of the Foreign Trade Bank in Kyiv. Through that bank the German occupational forces were officially conducting all financial operations with the Reichsbank in Berlin. The next day, Eichhorn issued a decree according to which all criminal cases on the territory of Ukraine could selectively fall under the jurisdiction of the German field military court instead of the Ukrainian court system. At the next session of the Central Rada, Holubovych stated:


On 29 April, a party congress of bread producers consisting of some 6,000 delegates from all eight governorates of Ukraine was taking place in the building of the Kyiv Circus. After receiving information about the situation at the Congress from his couriers, Pavlo Skoropadskyi later arrived in his car to the event where he was elected the Hetman of Ukraine. After that all participants moved to St. Sophia&#x27;s Square, where Skoropadskyi was blessed by Nykodym, the Vicar of Kyiv and Galicia (Metropolitan Vladimir was executed by Bolsheviks). That night the Hetman supporters took over government building of military and internal affairs as well as the State Bank. The following day, the elite and most loyal formation of the Central Council, the Sich Riflemen, was disarmed.

Skoropadskyi issued his manifesto (&quot;hramota&quot;) &quot;To the All-Ukrainian Nation&quot; and the Law of the Provisional State System. Desiring stability, the Austro-Hungarian and German forces welcomed the coup; Skoropadskyi co-operated with them, making him unpopular among many Ukrainian peasants. The new state retained the &quot;tryzub&quot; (coat of arms) and the national flag but reversed the design to light blue over yellow. The Sich Riflemen opposed the coup and were disbanded along with the &quot;Bluecoats&quot;, a Ukrainian division formed from POWs in Germany and Austria-Hungary named after their blue uniforms.

=== Internal opposition ===
Internal opposition was provoked by the requisitioning of food stocks and restoration of land to the wealthy landowners. Opponents of the Skoropadskyi regime committed acts of arson and sabotage and, in July 1918, assassinated Hermann von Eichhorn, the commander of German troops in Ukraine. In August 1918, the anti-Skoropadskyi coalition succeeded in forcing him to re-form the Sich Riflemen. By then it was becoming obvious that the Central Powers had lost the war and that Skoropadskyi could no longer rely on their support. He thus looked for support from conservative Russian elements in society and proposed joining a federation with Anton Denikin and the White movement. This further eroded his standing among Ukrainians.

In December 1918, Skoropadskyi was deposed and the Directorate was established as a form of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

== Geography ==

The country lay in Eastern Europe along the middle and lower sections of the Dnieper on the coast of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The Ukrainian State covered most of the territory of modern-day Ukraine—minus West Ukraine, Budjak and Crimea. Its territory however extended into today&#x27;s Russia, Belarus, Moldova and Poland.

To its northeast Ukraine established a preliminary demarcation line with the Russian SFSR, on the east it had a border with the Don Republic, to its south were the Black and Azov Seas, while the Crimean peninsula—the Crimean Regional Government—came under the control of Sulkevych. To the southwest along the Dniester lay a border with the Kingdom of Romania, to the west Ukraine bordered the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. To the north were the German-occupied territories of &quot;Ober Ost&quot; and the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic.

== Administrative divisions ==


== Anti-Hetman Uprising ==


Almost the entire commanding staff of the Ukrainian State armed forces consisted of officers of the former Imperial Russian Army. Most officers were not supportive of the Ukrainian cause and viewed it as a way to make it through tough times. At the same time, wide masses of the population did not have a developed sense of nationalism and mainly chose to follow socialist and communist principles.

Following the armistice ending World War I, Ukrainian socialists formed the Directorate of Ukraine (the &quot;Directory&quot;), whose forces were spearheaded by the Sich Riflemen and &quot;Greycoats&quot;. Although German and Austrian troops had not yet withdrawn from Ukraine, they had no further interest in fighting. Most of Skoropadskyi&#x27;s own forces changed sides and joined the Directory.

On 16 November 1918, starting in Bila Tserkva, fighting broke out in the Hetmanate. Skoropadskyi had to turn to the thousands of Russian White Guard officers who had escaped to Ukraine with the intention of joining Denikin&#x27;s Volunteer Army in the region of the Don river further east. They were assembled into a &quot;Special Corps&quot; but proved unable to resist the Directory&#x27;s forces led by Symon Petliura. Skoropadskyi abdicated his position as Hetman on 14 December, as the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army took Kyiv. He was expelled and the Hetmanate was replaced by the provisional government of the Directorate.

== Religion ==

According to the &quot;Laws on the Provisional State System of Ukraine&quot;, the leading position of the country was occupied by the Christian Orthodox faith. At the same time, citizens of Ukraine who belonged to other denominations had the right to profess their religion and rites.

The Russian Orthodox Church, and later the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, ruled in Central and Eastern Ukraine. However, in Western Ukraine there was friction between Orthodox, Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics and Jews. In the conflicts, the Ministry of Confessions of the Ukrainian State and the Council of Ministers morally and materially supported the Orthodox clergy.

On 25 June, the government allocated 3 million rubles to help priests who moved to Volhynia, Kholmshchyna, Grodno, Podolia, and Polesia, which were annexed to the Ukrainian State. On 2 July, 120,000 roubles were allocated for the maintenance of the Orthodox clergy in the lands of Kholmshchyna, Podlachia and Polesia.

<text>Potassium benzoate (E212), the potassium salt of benzoic acid, is a food preservative that inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It works best in low-pH products, below 4.5, where it exists as benzoic acid. 

Acidic foods and beverages such as fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbonic acid), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), and pickles (vinegar) may be preserved with potassium benzoate. It is approved for use in most countries including Canada, the United States and the European Union, where it is designated by the E number E212.

Potassium benzoate is also used in the whistle in many fireworks.

== Synthesis==
One very common way to make potassium benzoate is by oxidizing toluene to benzoic acid followed by a neutralization with potassium hydroxide: 

Another way to synthesize potassium benzoate in the lab setting is by hydrolyzing methyl benzoate with potassium hydroxide:

== Reactions ==
Potassium benzoate, like sodium benzoate, can be decarboxylated with a strong base and heat:

== Mechanism of food preservation==
The mechanism of food preservation begins with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%.

== Safety and health ==
Potassium benzoate has low acute toxicity upon oral and dermal exposure. The Food Commission, which campaigns for safer, healthier food in the UK, describes potassium benzoate as &quot;mildly irritant to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes&quot;.

==Spectra==
===Carbon-13 NMR ===
The carbon-13 NMR shows 5 unique peaks. There are four peaks between 130-140 ppm from the carbon atoms in the benzene ring. There is an additional carbon peak around 178 ppm representing the carbon atom from the carbonyl group.

===Infrared spectrum ===
The following are the main peaks in the IR spectrum.
* 1610: C=O from carbonyl
* 1580: C=C from benzene ring

<doc id="703789" wikidata="Q212674" url="?curid=703789" title="Dactyl (poetry)">
<text>A dactyl (; , &quot;dáktylos&quot;, “finger”) is a foot in poetic meter. In quantitative verse, often used in Greek or Latin, a dactyl is a long syllable followed by two short syllables, as determined by syllable weight. The best-known use of dactylic verse is in the epics attributed to the Greek poet Homer, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In accentual verse, often used in English, a dactyl is a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables—the opposite is the anapaest (two unstressed followed by a stressed syllable).

An example of dactylic meter is the first line of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Evangeline&quot; (1847), which is in dactylic hexameter:
:&quot;This is the / forest prim- / eval. The / murmuring / pines and the / hemlocks,
The first five feet of the line are dactyls; the sixth a trochee.

Stephen Fry quotes Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;The Lost Leader&quot; as an example of the use of dactylic metre to great effect, creating verse with &quot;great rhythmic dash and drive&quot;:
: &quot; Just for a handful of silver he left us &quot;
: &quot; Just for a riband to stick in his coat &quot;
The first three feet in both lines are dactyls.

Another example is the opening lines of Walt Whitman&#x27;s poem &quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking&quot; (1859), a poem about the birth of the author&#x27;s poetic voice:
: Out of the cradle, endlessly rocking [a dactyl, followed by a trochee (&#x27;cradle&#x27;); then another dactyl followed by a trochee (&#x27;rocking&#x27;)]
: Out of the mockingbird&#x27;s throat, the musical shuttle [2 dactyls, then a trochee (&#x27;throat, the&#x27;); then another dactyl, followed by a trochee]
The dactyl &quot;out of the...&quot; becomes a pulse that rides through the entire poem, often generating the beginning of each new line, even though the poem as a whole, as is typical for Whitman, is extremely varied and &quot;free&quot; in its use of metrical feet.

Dactyls are the metrical foot of Greek and Latin elegiac poetry, which followed a line of dactylic hexameter with dactylic pentameter.

In the opening chapter of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922), a character quips that his name is &quot;absurd&quot;: &quot;Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls&quot; (Mal-i-chi Mull-i-gan).

== Dactyls in contemporary poetry ==

The anthology &quot;Measure for Measure: An Anthology of Poetic Meters&quot; collects a number of contemporary as well as classic poems in dactylic meter. Recent dactylic poems in the meter online include &quot;Moon for Our Daughters&quot; and &quot;Love in the Morning&quot; by Annie Finch, and &quot;Song of the Powers&quot; by David Mason

A contemporary use in popular music is &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot; by Bob Seger, which alternates between dactylic pentameter (albeit with an extra syllable, or hypercatalexis), followed by a line in dactylic tetrameter:

&lt;poem&gt;
;Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
;Then came that morning, he woke up alone
;He spent all night staring down at the lights of L.A.
;Wondering if he could ever go home&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>John Baine (born 21 October 1957), better known by his stage name Attila the Stockbroker, is an English punk poet, multi instrumentalist musician and songwriter. He performs solo and as the leader of the band Barnstormer 1649, who combine early music and punk. He has performed over 3,800 concerts, published eight books of poems, an autobiography (which itself has 38 poems in it) and in 2021 his Collected Works spanning 40 years. He has released over forty recordings (albums and singles).

==Early life==
Baine attended the University of Kent, Darwin College, in Canterbury between 1975 and 1978 graduating with a 2:2 degree in French and Politics. Baine took the performing name Attila the Stockbroker during a short stint as a City stockbroker&#x27;s clerk between 1980 and 1981, because a colleague accused him of having the eating habits of Attila the Hun.

==Career==
Having started performing in the late 1970s after being inspired by the spirit and &#x27;do it yourself&#x27; ethos of the punk subculture, particularly The Clash&#x27;s overtly socialist stance, Baine was briefly bass player in punk bands English Disease and Brighton Riot Squad, and spent some time in 1979 in Brussels playing bass in Belgian band Contingent before going solo. He did his first gig as Attila the Stockbroker at Bush Fair Playbarn, Harlow, Essex, on 8 September 1980. At first he performed poems and songs in between bands at punk rock concerts, accompanying himself on the phased electric mandolin. After this was smashed over his head by fascists during a fight at a performance in North London in May 1982, he got a mandola (a fifth lower) and has played this ever since. He refers to his mandola as &quot;Nelson&quot;, in tribute to Nelson Mandela. He has performed in 24 countries, playing venues ranging from the Oxford Union in England to squatted punk clubs in Germany, and performs between 80 and 100 shows every year, sometimes more. He toured East Germany four times before the Berlin Wall came down, performed in a hotel in Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Albania and had to turn down the opportunity to perform in North Korea (at the World Festival of Youth &amp; Students in 1989) because he was already booked to tour Canada. He was signed by Cherry Red in 1982 after recording a session for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show. He recorded a second session for Peel in 1983.

In the 1980s, he was often the support act for punk bands, including The Jam, The Alarm, Newtown Neurotics, New Model Army, and performed extensively with fellow punk-inspired ranting poets, Swift Nick (Nick Swift), Kool Knotes (Richard Edwards), Porky the Poet (Phill Jupitus) and Seething Wells (Steven Wells). Manic Street Preachers supported him at a performance at Swansea University. In the 1990s, alongside many other things, he toured with John Otway as Headbutts and Halibuts, and together they wrote a surreal rock opera called &quot;Cheryl&quot;, a tale of Satanism, trainspotting, drug abuse and unrequited love. He has performed at every Glastonbury Festival since 1983, at the Edinburgh Fringe on and off for 35 years, and continues to write topical, satirical material on all kinds of subjects. He puts on an annual beer and music festival &#x27;Glastonwick&#x27;, currently held at Coombes Farm, near Shoreham though originally in Southwick, his home town nearby. The 30th Glastonwick will take place in 2025.

Notable works from the 1980s include the poem &quot;Contributory Negligence&quot;; various Russian-themed poems, satirizing the alleged Cold War Russian threat in the context of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain (such as &quot;Russians in the DHSS&quot; and &quot;Russians in McDonald&#x27;s&quot;). Other political poems include the surreal &quot;Nigel&quot; series, such as &quot;Nigel wants to go to C&amp;A&quot;. Later pieces include &quot;Asylum Seeking Daleks&quot;, which satirises the right wing press&#x27;s attitudes to immigration, and &quot;Hey Celebrity&quot;, which rejects the need for the concept of celebrity.

Attila the Stockbroker formed the band Barnstormer in 1994, with the initial aim of combining punk rock and early music, which they did to an extent on their debut album, &quot;The Siege of Shoreham&quot;, in 1996. Then Barnstormer&#x27;s line up changed: they turned into a melodic punk band and for the next 22 years performed regularly across Europe, doing over 500 gigs and releasing three further albums, &quot;Just One Life&quot; (2000) &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; (2004) and &quot;Bankers and Looters&quot; (2012). In 2018, Attila, who has always been interested in the history of the radical movements spawned in the aftermath of the English Civil War, wrote and recorded an album, &quot;Restoration Tragedy&quot; on that theme, combining early music and punk. He changed the name of the band to Barnstormer 1649 (the year of King Charles I of England&#x27;s execution and the revolutionary uprisings by the Levellers and Diggers).

Barnstormer 1649 features Attila on vocals, mandola, violin, viola, crumhorn, cornemuse, shawm, bombard, rauschpfeife and recorder; Jason Pegg (formerly of Clearlake) on guitar/backing vocals; M. M. McGhee on drums; Dave Cook (also of Too Many Crooks) on bass/backing vocals and Tim O&#x27;Tay on recorder.

Attila is still doing many solo shows combining his poems and songs. He has released three CDs featuring live recordings of solo gigs: &quot;Live in Belfast&quot; (2003) &quot;Live in Norway&quot; (2007) and &quot;Live at the Greys&quot; (2014). His book of poems, &quot;Undaunted&quot;, was published in 2017, &quot;UK Gin Dependence Party and Other Peculiarities&quot; in January 2014 and &quot;My Poetic Licence&quot; came out in 2008. In 2010, he published a pamphlet, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, containing two poems – a long one dedicated to, and chronicling the life of his mother, Muriel, who died in June 2010, after a six-year battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and a shorter one written for his stepfather, John Stanford, who died in December 2009. &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; was featured on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; on Mother&#x27;s Day in 2011. Attila celebrated 30 years of performing in September 2010, with a 27-date tour of the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In March 2011, he toured Australia and New Zealand for the first time in ten years. In 2012, he made a return to Albania and, in February 2014, toured the UK, Germany and Switzerland, to promote his latest poetry book. In 2018, he performed at the Limerick Limerick Festival and continues to tour mainland Europe.

8 September 2015, the 35th anniversary of his first gig, saw the publication of his autobiography, &quot;Arguments Yard (35 Years of Ranting Verse and Thrash Mandola)&quot; by Cherry Red Books.

In September 2016, Attila performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

In 2017, a short documentary, &quot;35 Years A Punk Poet&quot;, about Attila&#x27;s performance career, was produced by film maker Farouq Suleiman.

In April 2021, delayed from 2020 by the pandemic, Cherry Red Books released &#x27;Heart on My Sleeve (Collected Works 1980–2020)&#x27;
an anthology of his life&#x27;s work. June 2021 saw the release of a dub poetry EP &#x27;Dub Ranting&#x27;, a collaboration with reggae producers What&#x27;s Left Dub, Kingsley Salmon and Rebel Control. His latest album &#x27;40 Years in Rhyme&#x27;, a dub poetry collection with the same collaborators, was released by Zorch Productions in June 2022.

==Football support==
Baine is a supporter of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. and, for about 16 years, was heavily involved in the successful battle to save the club and secure a new stadium, after the Goldstone Ground was sold to property developers in 1997. The Seagulls finally moved to their new stadium at Falmer in August 2011. He has been the team&#x27;s poet in residence since 2000, and was the stadium announcer and DJ for 14 years, first at Gillingham, where the club spent two seasons playing &#x27;home&#x27; games, and then at the club&#x27;s temporary home at Withdean Stadium. As the main member of the one-off band, Seagulls Ska, he had a single reach No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart in 2005, as part of the campaign for the new stadium. &quot;Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)&quot;.

On 17 August 2016, just before the start of Brighton&#x27;s debut in the Premier League, he appeared in a &quot;Guardian&quot; documentary, &quot;From Nowhere to the Premier League&quot;, about the fans&#x27; role in the club&#x27;s survival and resurgence. On 12 August his poem on that theme, &quot;From Hereford To Here&quot;, was broadcast by BT Sport before the coverage of their first game against Manchester City. In 1989, he appeared on the &quot;Kickback&quot; segment of &quot;The Channel Four Daily&quot;, reflecting on Liverpool&#x27;s 9–0 win over Crystal Palace.

== Collections ==
The University of Kent holds an archive of material relating to Baine&#x27;s career which forms part of the British Stand-Up Comedy Archive. The collection includes press coverage, publicity material, fanzines and zines, and his manifesto for election as the University of Kent&#x27;s Student President.

<text>Salem is a town in eastern Washington County, New York, United States. It is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town population was 2,612 at the 2020 census. The town of Salem contains a hamlet also named Salem, formerly an incorporated village.

== History ==

Salem was first settled in 1761 by Joshua Conkey and James Turner, who as soldiers in the French and Indian War, passed through the territory. In 1764, Alexander and James Turner acquired a patent which was soon divided up between the New Englanders from Pelham, Massachusetts and a group of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, led by Dr Thomas Clark from Ballybay, County Monaghan, Ireland.

The Charlotte County and White Creek militia used Salem as its base in 1776.

The 123rd Volunteer Regiment was recruited from Salem during the Civil War.

The Alexander McNish House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010 and Martin–Fitch House and Asa Fitch Jr. Laboratory in 2014.

<doc id="703794" wikidata="Q1904772" url="?curid=703794" title="Angophora">
<text>Angophora is a genus of nine species of trees and shrubs in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. Endemic to eastern Australia, they differ from other eucalypts in having juvenile and adult leaves arranged in opposite pairs, sepals reduced to projections on the edge of the floral cup, four or five overlapping, more or less round petals, and a papery or thin, woody, often strongly ribbed capsule. Species are found between the Atherton Tableland in Queensland and south through New South Wales to eastern Victoria, Australia.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Angophora&quot; are trees, occasionally shrubs, with rough bark except for &quot;A. costata&quot;. The juvenile leaves differ from adult leaves in being hairy with raised oil glands. Both juvenile and adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, the adult leaves usually and paler on the lower surface. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven. The flower has four or five small sepals, reduced to small projections on the rim of the floral cup. There are four or five more or less round, keeled, overlapping petals and whorls of many creamy white stamens. Unlike in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and &quot;Corymbia&quot;, the petals and sepals are not fused to form a cap-like operculum. The fruit is a papery or thin, slightly woody, hairy capsule with longitudinal ribs.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Angophora&quot; was first formally described in 1797 by Antonio José Cavanilles in his book &quot;Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum&quot;.

&quot;Angophora&quot; is closely related to &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, and all three genera are often referred to as &quot;eucalypts&quot;. Collectively the eucalypts dominate many Australian ecosystems. Taxonomists have long recognised the relationships between the eucalypt taxa, but have not agreed upon a classification scheme. Some have proposed merging &quot;Angophora&quot; and &quot;Corymbia&quot; into genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; as subgenera, a plan which was immediately rejected by others. Some authors maintain &quot;Angophora&quot; as a genus, while others continue to debate the issue.

Among the eucalypts, &quot;Angophora&quot; species were nicknamed &quot;apples&quot; by European settlers, who thought they resembled apple trees. Many are still known commonly as apples today.

==Species==
The following is a list species of accepted by the Australian Plant Census as at March 2020:
* &quot;Angophora bakeri&quot; - NSW
** &quot;Angophora bakeri&quot; subsp. &quot;bakeri&quot; - NSW

<doc id="703799" wikidata="Q4531360" url="?curid=703799" title="Harold Alfond">
<text>Harold Alfond (March 6, 1914 – November 16, 2007) was an American businessman who founded the Dexter Shoe Company and established the first factory outlet store.

==Early life==
Alfond was born in Swampscott, Massachusetts, on March 6, 1914, the son of Jewish immigrants Simon and Rose Alfond. Harold, his brother David, and four sisters, Anne, Bertha, Gladys and Grace, grew up in Swampscott and attended Swampscott schools. In high school, Harold was an outstanding athlete and developed his passion for sports.

==Founding Dexter Shoes==
After graduating from high school in 1934, Alfond got a job at Kesslen Shoe Company in Kennebunk, Maine, where his father worked. In a short time, he rose from odd shoe boy to factory superintendent. In 1940, Alfond and his father bought a shoe factory in Norridgewock, Maine, and founded Norrwock Shoe Company. They sold the company to Shoe Corp. of America in 1943 and Simon Alfond stayed on as president for 25 years.

In 1956, Alfond left, purchased an old woolen mill in Dexter, Maine, and founded Dexter Shoe Company. There, he produced shoes for the private label catalog market, supplying stores such as Sears, JC Penney, Spiegel, and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Although Dexter was successful from the beginning, Alfond tired of being controlled by a few large customers and decided to go into the &quot;branded&quot; business. He developed a line of shoes under the Dexter name, hired a sales force and began selling to independent shoe stores across the country.

Alfond is often credited with the invention of the factory outlet store. Because factories make mistakes, not all shoes pass quality control; these products are called factory seconds. The practice in the industry was to sell these shoes to jobbers for about a dollar a pair, who would then resell them for five times their cost. Alfond thought that was a pretty good mark-up, so in the 1960s he opened an outlet store at Dexter&#x27;s Skowhegan factory and started selling his own factory seconds. Soon, the factories weren&#x27;t making enough mistakes to supply the store, so Harold decided to put in stale inventory (first grade shoes that weren&#x27;t selling in the wholesale market). This worked so well that Dexter&#x27;s log-cabin-style outlet stores started appearing on all the heavily traveled roads throughout New England. Other manufacturers caught on to the idea and as Dexter put up new stores, other manufacturers would open their outlets next door. By the 1990s, the Dexter Factory Outlet chain had expanded to over 80 stores. About this time, Dexter also stopped building freestanding log cabins and began leasing stores in outlet malls.

Dexter continued to grow rapidly throughout the 1970s and 1980s and from time to time, corporate suitors came calling to see whether they could entice Dexter into a marriage. Many were national retail chains that promised rapid expansion, but would emphasize foreign production and likely, a departure from Dexter&#x27;s family style of running the business. Alfond eventually decided to sell to Berkshire Hathaway, with an agreement to not interfere with the family&#x27;s continued management of the business. In 1993, Dexter and its affiliates, Pan Am Shoe and Ocsap Ltd., were sold for $433 million in stock; eight years later Warren Buffett decided to fold Dexter into another business, H.H. Brown, characterizing the purchase in 2008 as &quot;the worst deal that I&#x27;ve made.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
In order to coordinate his charitable giving, the 36-year-old Alfond organized the first private foundation in the state of Maine, the Harold Alfond Foundation. Between 1950 and 2003, the foundation has contributed more than $100 million to charitable causes, and as of 2008 had over $106 million in assets.

He has donated money to various institutions of learning to help improve their sports facilities; for example, the Alfond Arena and Alfond Stadium at the University of Maine, the Harold and Ted Alfond Sports Center at Rollins College, the Harold Alfond Center for Health Sciences
and the Alfond Forum at the University of New England, the Harold Alfond Management Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst&#x27;s Isenberg School, and the Alfond Center at Saint Joseph&#x27;s College of Maine. In December 2003, five years after his $1.65-million donation for the athletic and recreation center, Alfond contributed $1 million to St. Joseph&#x27;s towards the $10 million needed to build Alfond Hall, the college&#x27;s primary academic hall.

In 2020, construction of the 350,000-square-foot Harold Alfond Athletics and Recreation Center at Colby College was finished. Funding was led by a cornerstone $80 million gift from the Harold Alfond Foundation.

Harold Alfond and the Alfond Foundation have also been major supporters of Kents Hill School in Readfield, Maine. Kents Hill opened the Alfond Athletics Center in 2001 and the Alfond Athletic Fields - the largest turf complex in New England - in 2008 after receiving substantial gifts. In 2011, Kents Hill received a $2.3 million gift for the construction of its Akin Learning Center. Most recently in 2015, the school received a $3.5 million matching grant for the construction of a new dining hall.

In 2007, having lived with cancer for 17 years, Alfond donated $7 million to a cancer care center at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta. The center is named the Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care.

The Alfond Scholarship Foundation introduced the &quot;Harold Alfond College Challenge&quot; in January 2009. Through the program, a $500 grant is given to every Maine resident who is enrolled before his or her first birthday; the money is intended to help Maine families plan for education beyond high school. As of July 2010, 5,500 babies have been enrolled in the program.

==Investments in sports==
In addition to his donations to colleges for improvements to their sports facilities, Alfond demonstrated his support of sports in other ways.
In 1978, a group purchasing the Boston Red Sox was looking for a Maine sportsman to join them. Alfond was the obvious choice and ever since Dexter has been a limited partner in the franchise. When Dexter was sold to Berkshire Hathaway in 1993, the Alfond family retained its stake in the team, a stake that remains in the hands of two of his sons.

In the 1980s, Alfond helped sponsor Kevin Mahaney in the sailor&#x27;s effort to compete in the Olympics. Mahaney later earned a silver medal in sailing at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Along with other investors, Alfond helped create Belgrade Lakes Golf Club, a course close to his summer home. The club has been recognized as among the best public golf courses in the country. In 2002, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; recognized the course as the only five-star public golf course in the Northeast.

==Family life==
In 1943, Alfond married Dorothy Levine, who was also Jewish; they raised four children: Ted, Susan, Bill, and Peter who grew to provide them with thirteen grandchildren. His wife died in December 2005.

One of the grandsons, Justin Alfond, was elected to the Maine Senate in 2008, and was elected Senate President in 2012.

==Death==
Alfond died on November 16, 2007, in Belgrade, Maine.

<doc id="703814" wikidata="Q1606309" url="?curid=703814" title="Peruvian sol (1863–1985)">
<text>The sol, later  (English: gold sol), was the currency of Peru between 1863 and 1985. It had the ISO 4217 currency code PES. It was subdivided into 10 &quot;dineros&quot; or 100 &quot;centavos&quot;. It also had two different superunits over its circulation life, the inca (1881–1882) and later the gold pound (1898–1931, abbreviated &quot;Lp.&quot;), both worth 10 soles.

==History==
The sol was introduced in 1863 when Peru completed its decimalization, replacing the &quot;real&quot; at a rate of 1 sol = 10 reales. The sol also replaced the Bolivian peso at par, which had circulated in southern Peru. Between 1858 and 1863, coins had been issued denominated in reales, centavos and escudos. The sol was initially pegged to the French franc at a rate of 1 sol = 5 francs (S/. 5.25 to and S/. 1.08 to US$1).

In 1880 and 1881, silver coins denominated in &quot;pesetas&quot;, were issued, worth 20 centavos to the peseta. In 1881, the &quot;inca&quot;, worth ten soles, was introduced for use on banknotes. The peg to the franc was replaced in 1901 by a link to sterling at a rate of 10 soles = 1 pound, with gold coins and banknotes issued denominated in pounds (&quot;libra&quot; in Spanish). This peg was maintained until 1930 when Peru left the gold standard and established an official rate of S/o 2.5 = US$1, a rate which remained until 1946. In 1933, banknotes were issued once more denominated in soles, now called &quot;soles de oro&quot;. This name also appeared from 1935 on coins, when silver was replaced by base metal.
Since 1975, multiple rates to the US dollar have been used.

Due to the chronic inflation that occurred in Peru during the second presidency of Fernando Belaúnde Terry, the sol was replaced in 1985 by the &quot;inti&quot; at a rate of 1,000 soles = 1 inti. The &quot;nuevo sol&quot; replaced the inti in 1991, during the administration of Alberto Fujimori, at the rate of 1 million to one (or 1 billion (109) old sols to 1 nuevo sol).

Sol notes and coins are no longer legal tender in Peru, nor can they be exchanged for notes and coins denominated in the current nuevo sol.

==Coins==
In 1863, cupro-nickel coins for 1 and 2 centavos and .900 silver coins for and 1 dinero and sol were introduced, followed by .900 silver and 1 sol in 1864. Gold 5, 10, and 20 soles were issued only in 1863. In 1875 and 1876, bronze replaced cupro-nickel. In 1879 and 1880, provisional coins were struck in cupro-nickel in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 centavos for replacing the banknotes with coins. In 1898, gold coins for 1 pound (Lp. 1 = 10 soles) were introduced, followed by Lp.  (5 soles) in 1902 and Lp.  (2 soles) in 1905. These were issued for circulation until 1930.

In 1918, cupro-nickel 5, 10 and 20 centavos coins were introduced, followed, in 1922 with S/.  and S/. 1 coins in .500 fineness silver. The silver , and 1 sol were replaced by brass coins in 1935. Brass 5, 10, and 20 centavos followed in 1942. In 1950, zinc 1 and 2 centavo coins were introduced which were issued until 1958. In 1965, 25 centavo coins were introduced, followed, in 1969, by cupro-nickel S/o 5 and S/o 10.

Production of 5 and 25 centavos ceased in 1975, followed by 10 and 20 centavos in 1976, and 50 centavos in 1977. In 1978, brass replaced cupro-nickel in the S/o 5 and S/o 10 whilst aluminium-bronze S/o 50 and cupro-nickel S/o 100 coins were introduced in 1979 and 1980. The last S/o 1 and S/o 5 coins were issued in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, brass S/o 10, S/o 50, S/o 100 and S/o 500 coins were issued. The last of these pieces was minted in 1985.

==Banknotes==
The first banknotes were introduced by the private banks. In 1864, &quot;Banco La Providencia&quot; introduced notes for 50, 200, 400, 80, and 200 soles, with all but the S/. 5 also denominated in pesos (25, 50, 100, and 250 pesos). Later issues of this bank included denominations of , 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 soles.

Other private banks which issued notes in Peru were:

Additional denominations to those issued by the Banco La Providencia included 10, 20 and 40 centavos, S/. 25 and S/. 400.
In 1879, the government introduced notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 soles. In 1881, 5 and 100 inca notes were overprinted with the denominations 50 and 1,000 soles. In 1914, bearer cheques were introduced for Lp. , Lp. 1, Lp. 5, and Lp. 10 (S/. 5, S/. 10, S/. 50 and S/. 100). 1 sol cheques were issued in 1918 whilst, in 1917, gold certificates for 5 and 50 centavos and 1 sol were issued. In 1922, the Reserve Bank of Peru took over paper money production, issuing a final series of pound notes.

In 1933, the Reserve Bank began issuing notes denominated in soles. The first issues were libra notes overprinted with the new denominations of S/o 5, S/o 10, S/o 50 and S/o 100. Regular issues followed in denominations of S/o , S/o 1, S/o 2, S/o 5, S/o 10, S/o 20, S/o 50 and S/o 100. 50 centavos and S/o 1 were only issued until 1935. S/o 500 notes were introduced in 1946, followed by S/o 200 and S/o 1,000 in 1968. The S/o 5 note was last produced in 1974, with the S/o 10 and S/o 50 being last issued in 1976 and 1977 respectively. That same year, S/o 5,000 notes were introduced. In 1979, S/o 10,000 notes were added, followed by S/o 50,000 in 1981.

<doc id="703824" wikidata="Q5296449" url="?curid=703824" title="Donna Rice Hughes">
<text>Donna Rice Hughes (born January 7, 1958) is an American activist, author, speaker and film producer who is president and chairperson of Enough Is Enough. In her work with Enough is Enough, Hughes has appeared on a variety of outlets as an Internet safety advocate. She first became known as a key figure in a widely publicized 1987 political scandal that contributed to the end of the second campaign of former Senator Gary Hart for the Democratic Party nomination for president.

==Early life==

Rice grew up in the Irmo area near Columbia, South Carolina. She attended Irmo High School and the University of South Carolina, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. She graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in biology.

After graduating from college, Rice won the Miss South Carolina World beauty pageant. She went to New York to compete nationally. Rice later moved to Miami, where she worked as a marketing representative for pharmaceutical giant Wyeth Laboratories in South Florida. She also worked as an actress, appearing in TV commercials, a 1986 episode of the TV series &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; an episode of the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and the movie &quot;The Last Plane Out&quot;.

== 1987 political scandal ==
Rice met former Senator Gary Hart at a 1986–87 New Year&#x27;s Eve Party at the Aspen, Colorado, home of her then boyfriend, rocker Don Henley. She later met Hart in Miami, and said she was &quot;very interested in getting into fund-raising&quot;. Soon after meeting Rice, Hart announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for president. Having enjoyed a surprisingly strong campaign in 1984 against the eventual nominee, former vice president Walter Mondale, he was widely perceived as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 1988. Shortly thereafter, rumors began circulating that he was a &quot;&quot;, leading Hart to invite the media to observe his public behavior and to claim that anybody who did so would &quot;be very bored.&quot;

In a controversial move, &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reporters stalked Rice on a flight from Miami to Washington, D.C., then staked out Hart&#x27;s townhouse following a phone call from someone trying to sell pictures from the trip. There, the &quot;Herald&quot;″s Jim McGee saw Hart and Rice return to Hart&#x27;s townhouse. The &quot;Herald&quot; reported that Rice had spent the night at Hart&#x27;s residence, but later conceded that it had not watched the back door, through which she could have left.

Their story was published on the same day that his quotation appeared in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. The ensuing report sent the media into frenzy. Hart said that the reporters could not know exactly when Rice arrived or why she was there, and Rice denied that she had slept at Hart&#x27;s house or that the relationship was sexual. Hart also denied the story&#x27;s accuracy.

Hart&#x27;s popular appeal suffered, and polls taken almost immediately afterward found him 10 points behind Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in New Hampshire. On May 8, 1987, a week after the story broke, Hart suspended his campaign after the &quot;Washington Post&quot; threatened to run a story about a woman Hart had dated while separated from his wife, and his wife and daughter became similar subjects of interest for tabloid newspapers.

===&quot;Monkey Business&quot; photo===
On the cover of its June 2, 1987 edition, the celebrity tabloid &quot;National Enquirer&quot; published a photograph of Rice sitting on Hart&#x27;s lap. The pair were pictured on a dock during a yacht trip to Bimini that Hart, Rice, and others took before he announced his presidential campaign. Hart is wearing a T-shirt bearing the words &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, the yacht&#x27;s name. The photo was published alongside the headline &quot;Gary Hart Asked Me to Marry Him&quot;. It was published weeks after Hart suspended his campaign, but has been subsequently collectively mistaken for the reason for Hart&#x27;s exit. There are allegations that Republican operative Lee Atwater set the photo up to discredit Hart.

Rice and Hart have consistently denied that their relationship was sexual and said they were just friends.

The scandal is depicted in the 2018 film &quot;The Front Runner&quot;, with Rice played by Sara Paxton.

===Aftermath===
The enormous publicity generated by the Hart scandal resulted in numerous lucrative offers, and while Rice refused most – including one for an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, an ABC movie of the week, book and magazine offers – she did appear in 1987 as the No Excuses jeans girl in commercials and advertisements for No Excuses jeans. She said, &quot;A month after the scandal broke, I tried to go back to work at the pharmaceutical company after a leave of absence. But because of all the publicity and resulting pressure and stress, I finally resigned.&quot; A month after the scandal broke, she began reconnecting with her Christian faith and then disappeared from the public eye for seven years. Rice lived in Los Angeles briefly, then moved to the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Northern Virginia in the early 1990s. There she married Jack Hughes, a businessman, in May 1994.

==Advocacy==
Since 1994, when she became communications director and spokesperson for Enough Is Enough, an American secular nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to make the Internet safer for families and children, Hughes has been an advocate and speaker on the issue of protecting children online. She became president and CEO of the organization in 2002. The organization has produced an Internet Safety 101SM program with the Department of Justice and other partners. She is the executive producer, host and instructor of the &quot;Internet Safety 101&quot; DVD series, which ran as a TV series on PBS, garnering Hughes an Emmy nomination in 2012 and the series an Emmy Award in 2013.

Hughes has testified before multiple congressional hearings on protecting children online. She and Enough Is Enough supported the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996, the Children&#x27;s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), and the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). Senator Trent Lott appointed Hughes to serve on the COPA Commission, and she co-chaired the COPA Hearings on filtering/ratings/labeling technologies. She also serves on various Internet safety advisory boards and task forces, including the 2006 Virginia Attorney General&#x27;s Youth Internet Safety Task Force and the 2008 Internet Safety Technical Task Force, formed with MySpace and the U.S. Attorneys General. Beyond addressing the dangers of Internet pornography, Hughes has also spoken into the issue of privacy online, teen suicide and the impact of cyberbullying. She has received numerous awards, including the National Law Center for Children and Families Annual Appreciation Award, and the &quot;Protector of Children Award&quot; and Media Impact Award from the National Abstinence Clearinghouse. In 2013, Hughes received the Women in Technology Leadership Award for &quot;Social Impact&quot;.

In 2014, Enough is Enough&#x27;s &quot;National Porn Free Wi-Fi&quot; campaign&quot; encouraged McDonald&#x27;s and Starbucks to add filters to block pornography on their Wi-Fi networks. In 2016, McDonald&#x27;s implemented a filtered Wi-Fi policy in most of its 14,000 stores. Starbucks followed suit and announced it would implement a global policy as well. That same year, Hughes won the 2014 Professional Women in Advocacy Excellence In Advocacy Award for &quot;Veteran Practitioner&quot;.

Enough Is Enough sponsored a &quot;Children&#x27;s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge&quot; in 2016, asking presidential candidates to pledge to combat both Internet pornography—including both illegal child pornography and legal adult pornography—if elected president. The Pledge states that if elected president, the pledging person will &quot;uphold the rule of law by aggressively enforcing existing federal laws to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online, including the federal obscenity laws, child pornography laws, sexual predation laws and the sex trafficking laws.&quot; Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump signed the pledge, and Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sent a letter of support.

Hughes has publicly spoken against articles appearing in &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; magazine that promote sexual activity of any kind to teens, sparking an online petition her organization initiated called &quot;Say No To &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;&quot; after it published &quot;Anal Sex: What You Need to Know/How to Do it the Right Way&quot;. The petition received more than 29,000 signatures calling to &quot;boycott &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; until this article is retracted and these types of articles cease to be published.&quot;

In October 2017, Hughes was one of 120 world leaders to participate in the &quot;Child Dignity In the Digital World&quot; World Congress in Rome to set the global agenda in the fight against child sexual abuse and exploitation in the digital age. The Congress concluded with a papal audience at the Vatican in which Pope Francis applauded the Congress in his address for concentrating with great foresight &quot;on what is probably the most crucial challenge for the future of the human family, the protection of young people&#x27;s dignity, their healthy development, their joy and their hope.&quot;

In November 2017, Hughes joined Candy Carson and others at the invitation of Homemakers for America for the grand opening of the Museum of the Bible in Washington D.C. to ring the replica of the Liberty Bell, launching a nationwide ringing of bells by churches to calling Americans to come together to &quot;Let Freedom Ring!&quot;

=== Writing ===
Hughes co-wrote the story for the May 2000 season finale episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel &quot;that dealt with online safety. She authored the book &quot;Kids Online: Protecting Your Children in Cyberspace&quot; and website &quot;ProtectKids.com&quot;. As a platform issue of Enough Is Enough, she has written and spoken regularly on the harms of online bullying, the relational brokenness of young people, and the need for a safer, kinder and ethical community on and offline.

Hughes was an outspoken supporter of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. She has also written numerous commentaries that have been published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, Politico, CNN, FOX News and other media outlets.

Hughes has called upon The Walt Disney Company to crack down on unauthorized &quot;Disney porn&quot; on the Internet.

==Personal life==
Hughes is married to Jack Hughes and has two adult stepchildren and three grandchildren. She has said she was a victim of date rape &quot;on the way to New York City by an older man who was involved with the pageant system, and lost my virginity at that time&quot;. She says the rape was &quot;the turning point in my life, the catalyst that propelled me further into an unhealthy lifestyle&quot;.

<text>The Cliopsidae, common name sea angels, are a taxonomic family of small, free-swimming sea slugs, pelagic marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusks in the order Opisthobranchia.

As is the case in all gymnosome pteropods, these sea angels lack a shell except during an early embryonic stage.

The small lateral wing-like flaps (parapodia) are used in a slow swimming mode. The foot is reduced to three small median lobes.

==Genera and species==
Genera and species within the family Cliopsidae include:

Genus &quot;Cliopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Cliopsis krohnii&quot; 

Genus &quot;Pruvotella&quot;
* &quot;Pruvotella danae&quot; 
** Distribution : Bermuda, Oceanic
** Length : 10 mm

<text>The Clapper is a sound-activated electrical switch, sold since 1984 by San Francisco, California based Joseph Enterprises, Inc. Joseph Pedott marketed the clapper with the slogan &quot;Clap On! Clap Off! The Clapper!&quot;. 

The Clapper plugs into a U.S.-type electrical outlet, and allows control of up to two devices plugged into the Clapper. An upgraded model, known as the Clapper Plus, includes a remote control function in addition to the original sound-based activation.

Although meant to activate by clapping, The Clapper can inadvertently be triggered by other noises like dogs barking for example. 

==Patent==
The smart Clapper was invented by Carlile R. Stevens and Dale E. Reamer, and issued U.S. Patent #5493618, had its application filed on 1993-05-07 and was granted on 20 February 1996.

<text>Bielsko (, , , ) was until 1950 an independent town situated in Cieszyn Silesia, Poland. In 1951 it was joined with Biała Krakowska to form the new town of Bielsko-Biała. Bielsko constitutes the western part of that town.

Bielsko was founded by the Cieszyn Piast dukes in the late 13th century on the grounds of village later called Stare Bielsko (&quot;Old Bielsko&quot;), on the Biała River. It was first mentioned in a written document in 1312. Originally settled by Germans, it became the largest German-language center (&quot;Deutsche Sprachinsel Bielitz&quot;) in the Duchy of Teschen, and remained so until the end of World War II. In 1572 it gained autonomy as the Duchy (State) of Bielsko. During the 18th century a rapid development of textile industry occurred, and at the beginning of the 19th century more than 500 weavers worked in the town. After the 1920 division of Cieszyn Silesia between Poland and Czechoslovakia it became, despite the protests of local Germans, a part of Poland.

According to the Austrian census of 1910 the town had 18,568 inhabitants. The census asked people for their native language: 15,144 (84.3%) were German-speaking, 2,568 (14.3%) were Polish-speaking and 136 (0.7%) were Czech-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, and most of them thus declared German as their native language. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 10,378 (55.9%), followed by Protestants with 4,955 (26.7%) and the Jews with 3,024 (16.3%). The vast majority of the Jews were exterminated by Nazis during World War II, and the German population was expelled by the Soviets after the war under the terms demanded by Stalin at the Potsdam Conference.

==Notable people==
* Three well-known Holocaust survivors from Bielsko are Kitty Hart-Moxon, Roman Frister and Gerda Weissmann Klein. All three have written autobiographies and other works about their experiences during the Second World War.
*Shlomo Avineri, an Israeli political scientist
* The ancestors of the British peer Christopher Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat, are also from what was Bielitz.
* Gustav Gyula Geyer (1828–1900), Hungarian educator and entomologist
* Maurice Bloomfield, an American linguist

<doc id="703873" wikidata="Q6264325" url="?curid=703873" title="John Williams (Salem, New York)">
<text>John Williams (September 1752July 22, 1806) was an American physician and politician from Salem, New York. He was most notable for his service in the United States House of Representatives from 1795 to 1799.

==Life==
Williams was born in Barnstaple, Devonshire, England in September 1752. He received a liberal education, studied medicine and surgery in St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, and served for one year as surgeon’s mate on an English man-of-war. He immigrated to America in 1773 and settled in New Perth, Charlotte County, New York (now Salem, Washington County), where he engaged in an extensive medical practice. He married Susanna (Thomas) Turner, and they had four children. After the death of his first wife, he married Mrs. Mary Townley.

Williams was a member of the New York Provincial Congress in 1775; he was reelected and served until its dissolution in 1777. He was appointed surgeon of state militia forces in 1775. Williams was a named colonel of the Charlotte County militia regiment in 1776 and retained command throughout the Revolutionary War. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1777 to 1779 when he was expelled for fraud and theft. One act of which he was accused was the submission of false muster and payrolls, which enabled him to draw government money for paying soldiers, but which he then kept. He was also accused of holding of courts-martial which were not authorized by militia regulations and fining soldiers who were found guilty, after which he withheld their salaries to pay the fines. He was later exonerated and resumed his political and military careers.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1781 and 1782, and again a member of the New York State Senate from 1782 to 1794. Williams was appointed a member of the first board of regents of the University of the State of New York in 1784. He served as brigadier general of militia in 1786.

During 1788 when the American people were debating whether their states should ratify the proposed Constitution of the United States, Williams was an Anti-Federalist, meaning that he opposed the proposed Constitution. Williams is one of several people suspected of having written very influential Anti-Federalist essays under the pen name Brutus. Williams was subsequently a delegate to the State ratification convention in 1788, where the Anti-Federalists failed to stop the Constitution, but succeeded in obtaining assurances that a Bill of Rights would be added.

He was a member of the Council of Appointment in 1789. In March 1789, Williams received a small number of votes running as a Democratic-Republican in the 5th District for Congress, but was defeated by Federalist Peter Silvester. In January 1793, Williams ran again as a Democratic-Republican for Congress, this time in the 9th District to which Washington County had been re-districted, but was defeated by Federalist James Gordon.

In December 1794, Williams was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 4th, and in December 1796 was re-elected as a Federalist to the 5th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1795 to March 3, 1799. In April 1798, he ran for re-election as a Federalist in the 7th District to which Washington County had been re-districted, but was defeated by Democratic-Republican John Thompson. In April 1802, he ran for election again as a Federalist in the 12th District to which Washington County had been re-districted, but was defeated by Democratic-Republican David Thomas.

He was a large landholder. He owned slaves. He was a promoter and director of a company organized to build the Erie Canal as a private enterprise, the project later being taken over and completed by the State, and a judge of the county court. Williams died in Salem on July 22, 1806; his interment was at Salem Revolutionary Cemetery.

The Salem chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution is named for Williams and Israel Harris.

<doc id="703882" wikidata="Q15524929" url="?curid=703882" title="Brian Linehan">
<text>Brian Richard Linehan (September 3, 1944 – June 4, 2004) was a Canadian television host from Hamilton, Ontario, best known for his celebrity interviews on the longrunning talk show &quot;City Lights&quot;.

==Background==
Linehan was born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1944, one of seven children. His estranged Irish father, Les, worked at one of the local steel mills, Dofasco; and his Serbian mother, Sava (née Kotur), was later remarried to a post-World War II Serbian immigrant, Jovan Rodic Sr. He too, was a steel worker.

At age 19, Linehan moved to Toronto, taking an entry-level job with Odeon Cinemas. The following year, he began working in public relations as an organizer of celebrity promotional visits to Toronto. By 1968, he was the general manager of Janus Films, a film distribution company.

==Career==
He joined Citytv in 1973 as the host of &quot;City Lights&quot;, a program which would eventually become syndicated throughout Canada and the United States. Linehan was renowned for his composure, interview skills and meticulous research, often leading to in-depth questions that could last for minutes. His guests often responded to his questions with astonishment at his depth of knowledge; actress Shirley MacLaine once commented that the stars flocked to Toronto &quot;so Brian could tell us about our lives&quot;. His interviewing style was parodied on &quot;SCTV&quot; by Martin Short as &quot;Brock Linahan&quot;, a character whose seemingly meticulous interview research—unlike Brian Linehan&#x27;s—almost always turned out to be totally, utterly wrong.

In 1988, &quot;City Lights&quot; was rebooted as &quot;MovieTelevision&quot;, an expanded magazine series on film which Linehan cohosted with Jeanne Beker. Linehan was not happy with the new format, however, as it left him with far less time to conduct in-depth interviews, and left the show in 1989 after its first season. He took some time off, and then spent the early 1990s as a freelance publicity interviewer.

From 1996 to 1998, he hosted a second show entitled &quot;Linehan&quot;, which was produced for CHCH-TV in Hamilton. In 1999, Linehan won a Gemini Award as Best Host in a Lifestyle or Performing Arts Program for his work on the show. After that show ended, he taught a television production course at Toronto&#x27;s Humber College.

Beginning in 2000, the original &quot;City Lights&quot; shows were reaired on the new Canadian cable channel Talk TV.

Linehan was also a longtime entertainment reporter on CFRB radio, and a frequent host of awards ceremonies such as the Genie Awards and the Geminis.

Linehan, who was gay, met Zane Wagman, a dentist, in the late 1960s. Through the 1970s, the couple also had a sideline business renovating and reselling houses. They remained together until Wagman&#x27;s death by suicide in 2002; however, Linehan was very guarded about his personal life, acknowledging only to his closest friends and never publicly that Wagman was anything more than a platonic roommate.

Linehan was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in 2001 and died in 2004. His ashes were scattered outside the Toronto home he had shared with Wagman, although Joan Rivers kept a small portion of them as a memento of him.

==Legacy==
He left his estate to The Brian Linehan Charitable Foundation, which attempts to raise the profile of Canadian talent and supports the creation of a Canadian star system. The foundation&#x27;s noted donations have included $1 million toward the creation of an actors&#x27; training program at the Canadian Film Centre, and $1 million to the Toronto International Film Festival toward the construction of the TIFF Bell Lightbox.

The public reading room at TIFF&#x27;s Film Reference Library is named in honour of Linehan. The library also holds many of his personal archives and research collections.

George Anthony, a longtime friend of Linehan&#x27;s, published the biography &quot;Starring Brian Linehan: A Life Behind the Scenes&quot; in 2008.

<text>MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; was a diesel-powered ocean liner built by the Bremer Vulkan shipyards in Bremen for Hamburg America Line (HAPAG). She was named after the city of St. Louis, Missouri. She was the sister ship of . &quot;St. Louis&quot; regularly sailed the trans-Atlantic route from Hamburg to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and New York City, and made cruises to the Canary Islands, Madeira, Spain; and Morocco. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was built for both transatlantic liner service and for leisure cruises.

In 1939, during the build-up to World War II, the &quot;St. Louis&quot; carried more than 900 Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany intending to escape antisemitic persecution. The refugees first tried to disembark in Cuba but were denied permission to land. After Cuba, the captain, Gustav Schröder, went to the United States and Canada, trying to find a nation to take the Jews in, but both nations refused. He finally returned the ship to Europe, where various countries, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, accepted some refugees. Many were later caught in Nazi roundups of Jews in the occupied countries of Belgium, France and the Netherlands, and some historians have estimated that approximately a quarter of them were killed in death camps during the Holocaust. These events, also known as the &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;, have inspired film, opera, and fiction.

==Background and early years==
Under construction number 670, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was launched on August 2, 1928, at the Bremer Vulkan in Bremen-Vegesack. She was 174.90 m long and 22.10 m wide and was measured with 16,732 GRT. Four double-acting six-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines (MAN type, built under license from Bremer Vulkan) each with an output of 3150 hp gave her a speed of . Her sister ship, &quot;Milwaukee&quot;, was launched on February 20, 1929.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; left Hamburg on March 28, 1929, for her maiden voyage to New York City, and was then mainly used in the North Atlantic service from Hamburg to Halifax, and then to New York. She also made cruises of 16–17 days each to the Canary Islands, Madeira and Morocco, especially in autumn and spring. From 1934 she was also chartered in the summer by the Office for Travel, Hiking and Holidays (RWU) of Strength Through Joy (KDF) to travel to Norway with 900 holidaymakers at a time.

==The &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot;==
Under the command of Captain Gustav Schröder, &quot;St. Louis&quot; set sail from Hamburg to Havana, Cuba on May 13, 1939, carrying 937 passengers, most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany.

Captain Schröder was a German who went to great lengths to ensure dignified treatment for his passengers. Food served included items subject to rationing in Germany, and childcare was available while parents dined. Dances and concerts were put on, and on Friday evenings, religious services were held in the dining room. A bust of Hitler was covered by a tablecloth. Swimming lessons took place in the pool. Lothar Molton, a boy traveling with his parents, said that the passengers thought of it as &quot;a vacation cruise to freedom&quot;.

On reaching Cuba, she anchored at 04:00 on May 27 at the far end of the Havana Harbor, but was denied entry to the usual docking areas. The Cuban government, headed by President Federico Laredo Brú, refused to accept the foreign refugees, although they held legal tourist visas to Cuba, as laws related to these had been recently changed. On May 5, 1939, four months before World War II began, Havana had abandoned its pragmatic immigration policy, by virtue of decree 937, which &quot;restricted entry of all foreigners except U.S. citizens, unless authorized by Cuban secretaries of state [and] subject [to] a bond of US $500.&quot; None of the passengers knew that their landing permits had been invalidated a few weeks earlier.

After the ship had been in the harbor for five days, only 28 passengers were allowed to disembark in Cuba. Twenty-two were Jews who had valid United States visas; four were Spanish citizens and two were Cuban nationals, all with valid entry documents. The last admitted was a medical evacuee, a desperate passenger who attempted suicide, and was allowed hospitalization in Havana.

Records show American officials Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau had made efforts to persuade Cuba to accept the refugees, quite like the failed attempts by the American Jewish &quot;Joint&quot; Distribution Committee, which pleaded with the government. After most passengers were refused landing in Cuba, Captain Schröder directed &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the remaining 907 refugees towards the United States. He circled off the coast of Florida, hoping for permission from authorities to enter the United States. Neither Hull nor U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to intervene to admit the refugees. Captain Schröder considered running &quot;St. Louis&quot; aground along the coast to allow the refugees to escape but, acting on Hull&#x27;s instructions, United States Coast Guard vessels shadowed the ship and prevented this.

After &quot;St. Louis&quot; was turned away from the United States, a group of academics and clergy in Canada tried to persuade Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to provide sanctuary to the passengers. The ship could have reached Halifax, Nova Scotia in two days. The director of Canada&#x27;s Immigration Branch, Frederick Blair, was hostile to Jewish immigration and persuaded the head of government on June 9 not to intervene.

As Captain Schröder negotiated and schemed to find passengers a haven, conditions on the ship declined. At one point he made plans to wreck the ship on the British coast to force the government to take in the passengers as refugees. He refused to return the ship to Germany until all the passengers had been given entry to some other country. US officials worked with Britain and European nations to find refuge for the Jews in Europe. The ship returned to Europe, docking at the Port of Antwerp (Belgium) on June 17, 1939, with the 908 passengers.

The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain agreed to take 288 (32 percent) of the passengers, who disembarked and travelled to the UK via other steamers. After much negotiation by Schröder, the remaining 619 passengers were also allowed to disembark at Antwerp. 224 (25 percent) were accepted by France, 214 (23.59 percent) by Belgium, and 181 (20 percent) by the Netherlands. The ship returned to Hamburg without any passengers. The following year, after the Battle of France, and the Nazi occupations of Belgium, France, and the Netherlands in May 1940, all the Jews in those countries were subject to high risk, including the recent refugees.
Based on the survival rates for Jews in various countries during the war and deportations, historians have estimated that 180 of the &quot;St. Louis&quot; refugees in France, 152 of those in Belgium and 60 of those in the Netherlands survived the Holocaust. Including the passengers who landed in England, of the original 936 refugees (one man died during the voyage), roughly 709 survived the war and 227 died. Later research tracing each passenger has determined that 254 (41.0%) of those who returned to continental Europe were murdered during the Holocaust.


==Legacy==
After the war, the Federal Republic of Germany awarded Captain Gustav Schröder the Order of Merit. In 1993, Schröder was posthumously named as one of the Righteous Among the Nations at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel.

A display at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., tells the story of the voyage of the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot;. The Hamburg Museum features a display and a video about &quot;St. Louis ship&quot; in its exhibits about the history of shipping in the city. In 2009, a special exhibit at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, entitled &quot;Ship of Fate&quot;, explored the Canadian connection to the tragic voyage. The display is now a traveling exhibit in Canada.

In 2011, a memorial monument called the &quot;Wheel of Conscience&quot; was produced by the Canadian Jewish Congress, designed by Daniel Libeskind with graphic design by David Berman and Trevor Johnston. The memorial is a polished stainless steel wheel. Symbolizing the policies that turned away more than 900 Jewish refugees, the wheel incorporates four inter-meshing gears, each showing a word to represent factors of exclusion: antisemitism, xenophobia, racism, and hatred. The back of the memorial is inscribed with the passenger list. It was first exhibited in 2011 at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, Canada&#x27;s national immigration museum in Halifax. After a display period, the sculpture was shipped to its fabricators, Soheil Mosun Limited, in Toronto for repair and refurbishment.

In 2012, the United States Department of State formally apologized in a ceremony attended by Deputy Secretary William J. Burns and 14 survivors of the incident. The survivors presented a proclamation of gratitude to various European countries for accepting some of the ship&#x27;s passengers. A signed copy of Senate Resolution 111, recognizing June 6, 2009, as the 70th anniversary of the incident, was delivered to the Department of State Archives.

In May 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the Government of Canada would offer a formal apology in the country&#x27;s House of Commons for its role in the fate of the ship&#x27;s passengers. The apology was issued on November 7, 2018.

==Later career==
MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; was adapted as a German naval accommodation ship from 1940 to 1944. She was heavily damaged by the Allied bombings at Kiel on August 30, 1944. The ship was repaired and used as a hotel ship in Hamburg in 1946. She was sold and scrapped at Bremerhaven in 1952.

<doc id="703912" wikidata="Q4794028" url="?curid=703912" title="Armstrongism">
<text>Armstrongism refers to the teachings and doctrines of Herbert W. Armstrong while leader of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). His teachings are professed by him and his followers to be the restored true Gospel of the Bible. Armstrong said they were revealed to him by God during his study of the Bible. The term &quot;Armstrongite&quot; is sometimes used to refer to those that follow Armstrong&#x27;s teachings. &quot;Armstrongism&quot; and &quot;Armstrongite&quot; are generally considered derogatory by those to whom it is applied, who prefer to be known as members of the &quot;Church of God&quot; (COG). These doctrines were also espoused by his sons Richard David Armstrong (until his death in 1958) and Garner Ted Armstrong (until his death in 2003) with slight variations.

Herbert Armstrong&#x27;s teachings have similarities to those of the Millerites and Church of God (Seventh Day) (sometimes referred to as &quot;COG7&quot; to differentiate it from similarly styled sects named &quot;Church of God&quot; which worship on Sunday and generally hold to traditional Christian teachings), from which WCG is spiritually and organizationally descended. The religion is a blend of Christian fundamentalism, non-belief in the Trinity and some tenets of Judaism and Seventh-Day Sabbath doctrine. Armstrong himself had been a COG7 minister before the Oregon conference stripped him of his ministerial credentials and excommunicated him for his seeking to &quot;water down&quot; and change their long-established COG7 doctrines. It was in the fall of 1937 when Elder Armstrong&#x27;s credentials were revoked by the Salem Church of God organization. The reason given by the Board of Twelve Oregon Conference of the Church of God, 7th Day (COG7) for this adverse action against Herbert W. Armstrong, was because he taught and kept the annual Feast days. But the real reason seems to have been because of his uncooperative attitude. Armstrong then began his own ministry.

Armstrong taught that most of the basic doctrines and teachings of mainstream Christianity were based on traditions, including absorbed pagan concepts and rituals (i.e. religious syncretism), rather than the Judeo-Christian Bible. His teachings have consequently been the source of much controversy. Shortly after Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1986, the Worldwide Church of God started revising its core beliefs toward the concepts, doctrines, and creeds of mainstream Christianity. This resulted in many ministers and members leaving the WCG to start or join other churches, many of which continue to believe and teach Armstrong&#x27;s doctrines to one degree or another. In 2009, the WCG changed its name to Grace Communion International (GCI). Today, the official doctrinal position of GCI is mainstream evangelical, although there are still GCI ministers and members who do not fully embrace all of the changes.

==Doctrinal differences==
Some of Armstrong&#x27;s identifiable doctrines are in addition to or are different from traditional mainstream Christian doctrines. Many groups and churches which splintered in the aftermath of doctrinal changes within the Worldwide Church of God continue to hold many or all of these teachings of Armstrong.

===God Family===
The God Family doctrine holds that the Godhead is not limited to God (the Creator) alone, or even to a trinitarian God, but is a divine family into which every human who ever lived may be spiritually born, through a master plan being enacted in stages. The Godhead now temporarily consists of two co-eternal individuals (see Binitarianism), Jesus the Messiah, as the creator and spokesman (The Word or Logos), and God the Father.

According to this doctrine, humans who are called by God&#x27;s Holy Spirit to repentance, who [accept], hope to inherit, the gift of eternal life made possible by Jesus&#x27; sacrifice, who commit to live by &quot;every word of God&quot; (i.e. biblical scripture), and who &quot;endure to the end&quot; (i.e. remain faithful to live according to God&#x27;s way of life until either the end of their own lifetime or the second coming of Jesus) would, at Jesus&#x27; return, be &quot;born again&quot; into the family of God as the literal spiritual offspring or children of God. Armstrong drew parallels between every stage of human reproduction and this spiritual reproduction. He often stated that &quot;God is reproducing after his own kind— children in his own image.&quot; Whatever the changes brought about by this new entrance of humans into God&#x27;s family, God the Father will always be the omnipotent sovereign and sustainer of both the universe and the spiritual realm, forever to be worshipped as God by the children of God. Jesus, as the creator of the universe and the savior of God&#x27;s children, will always rule the Kingdom of God, which will ultimately grow to fill the entire universe, and he likewise will forever be worshipped as God by the children of God.

===Church&#x27;s authority===
Armstrong taught that the Bible (excluding the Biblical apocrypha and the deuterocanonical books) is the authoritative Word of God (&quot;The Proof of the Bible&quot;). He taught that even though the Bible&#x27;s message is inerrant, it had been distorted as the result of many conflicting interpretations of it, and the Gospel&#x27;s full message of the Kingdom of God as it was understood by the original apostles was not restored until the 20th century, when God opened Armstrong&#x27;s mind to the plain truth of scripture and revealed the Gospel&#x27;s full message of the Kingdom of God to the Church through him (Armstrong). Armstrong taught that all other churches which called themselves &quot;Christian&quot; churches were not merely apostate churches, they were actually counterfeit churches because their histories could be traced back to the first century, and they are also described as false churches in the epistles (which refer to a &quot;false gospel&quot;, &quot;false ministers&quot;, and &quot;false apostles&quot;), the eighth chapter of the Book of Acts (the appropriation of &quot;Christian&quot; trappings by influential and ambitious pagan religious figures [including a man known to secular history, Simon Magus, mentioned in Acts]) and later historians like Eusebius.

===Sabbatarianism and other Old Testament beliefs===
The observance of the Sabbath from dusk on Friday to dusk on Saturday was the first non-traditional religious practice (as compared to mainstream Christianity). In several of his books, Armstrong wrote that after his wife Loma met a member of a Sabbatarian church group (the Church of God (Seventh Day)), she challenged him to use scripture to prove that Sunday was the proper day for Christian worship, as Herbert claimed. After months of Bible study, Armstrong concluded that there was no sound scriptural basis for Christian worship on Sunday, instead, he asserted that for decades after the establishment of the Church age, the Apostles and the first generation of Christians, both Jewish and Gentile converts, continued to set an example for all Christians by observing the Sabbath on the seventh day of the week (from Friday at sunset to Saturday at sunset).

Eventually, Armstrong accepted and observed many principles and laws which are found in the Old Testament and he also taught converts to do the same. These principles and laws included the Ten Commandments, dietary laws, tithing, and the celebration of high Sabbaths, or annual feast days such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. Furthermore, he taught that Christians should not celebrate Christmas and Easter, based on his belief that these holidays were not of biblical origin, instead, he believed that the celebration of them originated as the result of later absorptions of pagan practices into corrupted Christianity.

===British Israelism===
Armstrong was a proponent of British Israelism (also known as &quot;Anglo-Israelism&quot;), which is the belief that people of Western European descent, especially the British Empire (Ephraim) and the United States (Manasseh), are descended from the &quot;Ten Lost Tribes&quot; of Israel. It is also asserted that the German peoples are descended from the ancient Assyrians. Armstrong believed that this doctrine provided a &quot;key&quot; to understanding biblical prophecy, and he also believed that God called him to proclaim these prophecies to the &quot;lost tribes&quot; of Israel before the coming of the &quot;end-times&quot;. Grace Communion International, the lineal successor to Armstrong&#x27;s original church, no longer teaches the doctrine, but many offshoot churches continue to teach it even though critics assert that British Israelism is inconsistent with the findings of modern genetics.

===Other teachings===
* God will soon set up his government on earth, under the rule of Jesus, at Jesus&#x27; Second Coming. He will rescue humanity from sin and self-annihilation, inspire mankind to voluntarily turn to God&#x27;s law, and usher in a 1000 year period of peace, prosperity, and justice. Humanity will be under the rule of the children of God, who are the biblical saints and faithful members of the Worldwide Church of God, &quot;born again&quot; as spirit in the first resurrection, when Jesus returns to the Earth.
* Non-believers are not yet eternally judged, having a future opportunity for salvation after a mortal resurrection (the second resurrection).
* The vast majority of all people who have ever lived will be saved; thus, the relatively small number of true Christians of this age are predestined to be merely the early &quot;First Fruits&quot; of God&#x27;s harvest, to help teach the majority of humanity raised by the second resurrection.
* The strict observance of the Ten Commandments is a required response of Christians to receiving the unearned gift of salvation from God. The Ten Commandments are an eternal and inexorable law, set in motion by God, which brings about every good effect when obeyed, but exacts pain, suffering, and eventually death (especially an ultimate spiritual death) when violated.
* Christians are required to observe the Holy Days of the Old Testament. These holidays symbolically teach the seven steps of God&#x27;s master plan of salvation for humanity.
* A system of tithing in which 10% of one&#x27;s total increase was donated to the church for its operation and for sharing the gospel with the world (&quot;first tithe&quot;); a second 10% was to be saved for the Christian family&#x27;s expenses during the Holy Days (&quot;second tithe&quot;); and during the third and sixth year of each seven-year cycle, a third 10% was to be used for the indigent, widows, and orphans within the church (&quot;third tithe&quot;). Besides first, second, and third tithes, there was a &quot;tithe of a tithe&quot;, 10% of one&#x27;s second tithe, for maintenance of festival sites. Free will offerings were expected as well. On top of that there were the building fund, the Summer Educational Program (SEP), and the YOU youth program, all financed by church members. The ministry did not pay tithes; they received tithes as Levites, and lived on a higher income than most members.
* Abstinence from eating unclean meats listed in the Old Testament, such as pork and shellfish.
* God&#x27;s children are not actually &quot;born again&quot; into spirit until after the return of Jesus to the Earth.
* The &quot;sleep&quot; state of the dead, meaning the dead have not yet been judged, rewarded, or condemned, but rather wait to be resurrected.
* Punishment of the incorrigible is not an eternity of torment in Hell, but rather a merciful annihilation, through fire, by the edict of God.
* Humans are completely mortal (i.e., no one possesses an immortal soul, because all are living mortal souls). Salvation is the free, unearned gift of eternal life in God&#x27;s family as children of God, given upon the prerequisite of faith in God and repentance from sin. This results in a motivation to completely observe God&#x27;s &quot;eternal laws&quot; (i.e., Old Covenant laws).
* Three resurrections of the dead—first, faithful believers as the First Fruit harvest at Jesus&#x27; Second Coming; second, non-believers temporarily resurrected to mortality for an opportunity to learn and accept God&#x27;s way; and third, resurrection of the incorrigibly wicked for final judgment. This final group will consist of those whose minds had been fully opened to God&#x27;s truth, either in this age or after the second resurrection, and rejected it; mainly, those truly called but who fell away, and those who incorrigibly rebel in the &quot;Wonderful World Tomorrow&quot;.

==Opinions==
Walter Martin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Kingdom of the Cults&quot; (1965) argues that Armstrong&#x27;s teachings are largely a conglomerate of teachings from other groups, noting similarities in elements of his teachings to the Seventh-day Adventists (sabbatarianism, annihilationism, and their belief that the soul remains asleep until its bodily resurrection), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (whose belief differs from the mainstream Christian belief that the soul stays awake and goes to either Heaven or Hell immediately following death), and Mormonism (God Family doctrine).

==Churches of God==
There are many splinter churches as well as second-generation splinters from WCG since Armstrong&#x27;s death. Most of these churches hold fast to Armstrong&#x27;s teachings and primarily pattern their organizations on how WCG operated. They are often referred to collectively as the &quot;Sabbatarian Churches of God&quot; or simply as the &quot;Churches of God&quot; or &quot;the COG&quot;.

<doc id="703917" wikidata="Q1322478" url="?curid=703917" title="Clapping">
<text>A clap is the percussive sound made by striking together two flat surfaces, as in the body parts of humans or animals. Humans clap with the palms of their hands, often quickly and repeatedly to express appreciation or approval (see applause), but also in rhythm as a form of body percussion to match the sounds in music, dance, chants, hand games, and clapping games.

Some people slap the back of one hand into the palm of the other hand to signify urgency or enthusiasm. This act may be considered uncouth by others.

Clapping is used in many forms of music. In American music, clapping is popular in funk, gospel, doo-wop and early pop. In flamenco and , two Spanish musical genres, clapping is called &quot;palmas&quot; and often sets the rhythm and is an integral part of the songs. A sampled or synthesized clap is also a staple of electronic and pop music.

== Musical works that include clapping ==
Classical works performed entirely by clapping
* Steve Reich, &quot;Clapping Music&quot; (1972)
* Robert Paterson, &quot;Voices&quot; (1988)
* Pascal Zavaro, &quot;Kino-Klap&quot; (2008)

Classical works which include clapping
*Carlos Surinach, &quot;Ritmo Jondo&quot; (1953)
*David Chesky, &quot;Flute Concerto&quot; et &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; 

The clapping patterns known as keplok are important in Javanese gamelan. A type of synthesized clap is popular in many rap and hip hop songs as well. This is derived from and mimics the technique used in older popular music (e.g. disco and funk of the 1970s), in which multiple instances of real handclaps were recorded or a single recording was made of a group of performers clapping in unison. This was usually done for the purpose of reinforcing the snare drum beat on the 2nd and 4th beats of the bar (offbeat). Modern R&amp;B, hip hop, and rap often omit the snare drum, making the claps a more obvious and central feature of the beat.

== Acoustics and medical applications ==
Clapping is useful in (medical) opening up blocked blood circulation.
Clapping can be used in acoustics to check the reverberation time of a room. This is determined by measuring the clap&#x27;s decay time.

== Pedagogical applications ==

Clapping is often used to help people recognize the rhythm in sounds. It can be used to help musicians count out rhythms.

It is also used to teach phonological awareness to students learning the ways words are constructed. They often clap out syllables to learn to break words into their component sounds.

== Sports and other pursuits==

During UEFA Euro 2016, Iceland&#x27;s fans became widely known for their &#x27;volcano clap&#x27; (or &#x27;Viking clap&#x27;) with a &#x27;huh&#x27; chant, though it originated with fans of Scottish club Motherwell F.C.
Canberra Raiders fans subsequently adopted the &#x27;Viking clap&#x27;. Similarly, fans of the Minnesota Vikings have also adopted the &#x27;Viking clap&#x27; to show support for the team, chanting &#x27;skol&#x27; rather than the original &#x27;huh&#x27; chant.

In the mid 2010s, a practice of clapping as a way to emphasize talking points emerged among African American women, especially when clapping out individual syllables in words. This was pointed out in popular media by the comedian Robin Thede on &quot;The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore&quot;. It has since become more widely applied both online, often using the &quot;hand clap&quot; emoji, and in person.

<text>Morris Abraham Cohen (born Moszek Abram Miączyn; 3 August 1887 – 7 September 1970), better known as Two-Gun Cohen, was a Polish-born British and Canadian adventurer of Jewish origin who became aide-de-camp to Sun Yat-sen and a major-general in the Chinese National Revolutionary Army.
==Early years==
Cohen was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Radzanów, Congress Poland, on 3 August 1887. His father was Josef Leib Mialczyn, a wheelwright, and his mother was Sheindel Lipshitz. In 1889 the family emigrated to England and settled in East London, where Josef worked in a textile factory. They changed their family name to the easier-to-pronounce Cohen, and Abraham went by Morris and Moishe.

Cohen loved the theaters, the streets, the markets, the foods and the boxing arenas of the British capital more than he did the Jews&#x27; Free School, and in April 1900 he was arrested as &quot;a person suspected of attempting to pick pockets&quot;. A magistrate sent him to the Hayes Industrial School, an institution set up by the likes of Lord Rothschild to care for and train wayward Jewish lads. He was released in 1905 and Cohen&#x27;s parents shipped the young Morris off to western Canada with the hope that the fresh air and open plains of the New World would reform his ways.

Cohen initially worked on a farm near Whitewood, Saskatchewan. He tilled the land, tended the livestock and learned to shoot a gun and play cards. He did that for a year, and then started wandering through the Western provinces, making a living as a carnival barker, gambler, card sharp, pickpocket, pimp, and successful real estate broker. Some of his activities landed him in jail, and in particular he was jailed in Winnipeg for sexual relations with a girl who was under the age of sixteen.

Cohen also became friendly with some of the Chinese exiles who had come to work on the Canadian Pacific Railways. He loved the camaraderie and the food, and in Saskatoon came to the aid of a Chinese restaurant owner who was being robbed. Cohen&#x27;s training in the alleyways of London came in handy, and he knocked out the thief and tossed him out into the street. 
Such an act was unheard of. Few white men ever came to the aid of a Chinese man in early 20th century Canada. As a Jew, though, Cohen felt an affinity for the Chinese underdog. He knew what it was like to be an outsider, someone who society shunned.

— Daniel S. Levy, author of &quot;Two-Gun Cohen: A Biography&quot;.
The Chinese welcomed Cohen into their fold and eventually invited him to join the Tongmenghui, Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s anti-Manchu organization. Cohen began to advocate for Chinese expatriates and learned the teachings of Sun Yat-sen. Morris Cohen soon moved to the city of Edmonton in the neighbouring province of Alberta. There he became manager of one of the provincial capital’s leading real estate agencies and was appointed, on the personal recommendation of the Attorney General Sir Charles Wilson Cross, to serve the province as a Commissioner of Oaths, an appointment offered only to &quot;fit and proper persons&quot;. He used his position to assist Chinese immigrants in becoming naturalised.

It was in pre-World War I Edmonton that Cohen commenced his long and varied military career by recruiting members of the Chinese community and training them in drill and musketry on behalf of Dr Sun Yat-sen’s representative organization in Canada.

==Military career==
The real estate market in Edmonton experienced a decline with the advent of World War I. Without any income, Cohen joined the 218th Battalion, CEF. He became a sergeant and moved to Camp Sarcee in Calgary for training. He became known by local newspapers for his regular clashes with the law. On one occasion in October 1916, he was among thirteen soldiers who were charged with disturbing the peace after an altercation with the Calgary City Police. He was acquitted after serving as his own defense, and the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; noted his &quot;surprising knowledge of court procedures.&quot;

Cohen fought with the Canadian Railway Troops in Europe during World War I where part of his job involved supervising the Chinese Labour Corps. He also saw some fierce fighting at the Western Front, especially during the Third Battle of Ypres. After the war, he resettled in Canada. But the economy had declined and the days of the real estate boom were long over. Cohen looked for something new to do, and in 1922 he headed to China to help close a railway deal for Sun Yat-sen with Northern Construction and JW Stewart Ltd. After disembarking in Shanghai, Cohen went to see George Sokolsky, the New-York born journalist who worked for Sun&#x27;s English-language &quot;Shanghai Gazette&quot;. Sokolsky arranged an interview for him with Eugene Chen, Sun&#x27;s English language secretary. Cohen was hired, and soon ensconced himself at Sun’s home at 29 Rue Molière in the city’s French Concession. He then got right to work.

In Shanghai and Canton (Guangzhou), Cohen trained Sun&#x27;s small armed forces to box and shoot, and told people that he was an aide-de-camp and an acting colonel in Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s army. Fortunately for Cohen, his lack of proficiency in Chinese – he spoke a pidgin form of Cantonese at best – was not a problem since Sun, his wife Soong Ching-ling and many of their associates were Western-educated and spoke English. Cohen&#x27;s colleagues started calling him Ma Kun (馬坤), and he soon became one of Sun&#x27;s main protectors, shadowing the Chinese leader to conferences and war zones.

After one battle where he was nicked by a bullet, Cohen wondered what he would do if one of his arms were injured. He started carrying a second revolver, and found he was ambidextrous. The western community were intrigued by Sun&#x27;s gun-toting protector and began calling him &quot;Two-Gun Cohen.&quot;

Sun died of cancer in 1925, and Cohen went to work for a series of Southern Chinese Kuomintang leaders, from Sun&#x27;s son, Sun Fo, and Sun&#x27;s brother-in-law, the banker T. V. Soong, to such warlords as Li Jishen and Chen Jitang. He was also acquainted with Chiang Kai-shek, whom he knew from when Chiang was commandant of the Whampoa Military Academy, which was located outside of Canton. His dealings with Chiang, though, were minimal since Cohen was allied with southern leaders who were generally opposed to Chiang. Cohen ran security for his bosses and acquired weapons and gunboats. Eventually he earned the rank of acting general, though he never led any troops.

Cohen spent time in Hong Kong, including at the Hong Kong Jewish Club where he played poker and performed magic tricks. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, Cohen eagerly joined the fight. He rounded up weapons for the Chinese and even did work for the British intelligence agency, Special Operations Executive (SOE). Cohen was able to prove that the Japanese were using poison gas to exterminate the Chinese masses. Cohen was in Hong Kong when the Japanese attacked in December 1941. He placed Soong Ching-ling and her sister Ai-ling onto one of the last planes out of the British colony.

Cohen stayed behind to fight, and when Hong Kong fell later that month, the Japanese imprisoned him at Stanley Internment Camp. There the Japanese badly beat him and he languished in Stanley until he was part of a rare prisoner exchange in late 1943. In December 1943, he arrived in Montreal.

==Later life==

Cohen sailed back to Canada, settled in Montreal and married Ida Judith Clark, who ran a women&#x27;s boutique. He made regular visits back to China with the hope of establishing work or business ties. Mostly, Cohen saw old friends, sat in hotel lobbies and spun out tales—many of them tall—of his exploits. It was his own myth making, together with the desire of others to fabricate yarns about him, that has resulted in much of the misinformation about Cohen, from the claim that he had a hand in the making of modern China, to such outlandish ones like him having an affair with Soong Ching-ling and a wife in Canada back in the 1920s.

In 1947, when the newly formed United Nations began the debate on the UN Resolution on the Partition of Palestine, following the UN Special Committee on Palestine recommendation, Morris Cohen flew to San Francisco and convinced the head of the Chinese delegation to abstain from voting when he learned they planned to oppose partition. After the 1949 Communist takeover, Cohen was one of the few people who was able to move between Taiwan and mainland China. His prolonged absences took a toll on his marriage, and he and Judith divorced in 1956.

Cohen then settled with his widowed sister, Leah Cooper, in Salford, England. There he was surrounded by siblings, nephews and nieces and became a beloved family patriarch. His standing as a loyal aide to Sun Yat-sen helped him maintain good relations with both Kuomintang and Chinese Communist leaders, and he soon was able to arrange consulting jobs with Vickers (planes), Rolls-Royce (engines) and Decca Radar.

His last visit to China was during the start of the Cultural Revolution as an honoured guest of Zhou Enlai, in 1966. Cohen died on 7 September 1970 in Salford. He is buried in Blackley Jewish Cemetery in Manchester. His tombstone includes markings in Hebrew and English. Having achieved good relations with both the Communist and Nationalist factions in China, a rare simultaneous public appearance of representatives from both factions occurred at Cohen&#x27;s funeral.

==Bibliography==
There are numerous publications that focus on the life of Morris Cohen:
* Charles Drage with Morris Cohen, &quot;Two-Gun Cohen&quot; (1954)
* Paolo Frere, &quot;The Pedlar and the Doctor&quot; (1995)
* Daniel S. Levy &quot;Two-Gun Cohen: A Biography&quot; (1997)
* Jim Christy, &quot;Scalawags&quot; (2008)

==Film==
*In Frank Capra&#x27;s The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), the character of &quot;Jones,&quot; a western adviser to the general, may resemble Cohen. The movie was based on a book of the same name by Grace Zaring Stone, who lived in Canton in the 1920s. In an interview with Stone&#x27;s daughter in the early 1990s, she said that she was not sure if her mother and Cohen&#x27;s paths crossed. But since the western community in that city was relatively insular, she said that it was quite likely that Stone at least knew of Cohen.
*&quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936) was inspired by Cohen, with Gary Cooper playing the part of an Irish-American adventurer in China.
*&quot;The Gunrunner&quot; (1983), a Canadian movie with Kevin Costner, was inspired by Cohen.

<text>The Black Company or the Black Troops () was a unit of Franconian farmers and knights that fought on the side of the peasants during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in the 1520s, during the Protestant Reformation in Germany.

==Name==
The original German name of the Black Company was . The term (black) pointed out the ideological distance of the company from the large peasant army at that time, which called itself the ( meaning &quot;light-colored&quot;). The German word was the name the peasants gave to their armed companies.

It was never used again for an army, possibly because the word means &quot;heap&quot; in German and was used to refer to loosely organised armed rabbles.

==Formation==
The Black Company was formed in 1525 in Rothenburg, out of local, home guard farmers - maybe 600 men - and a company of mercenary knights.

The leader of the Black Company, at least nominally, was nobleman Florian Geyer.

Geyer managed to shape the Black Company into something like a company of real soldiers, instead of just an armed mob. Some of the knights were probably his vassals.

==History==
After the Company took over the area around Rothenburg, it proceeded to Swabia to destroy fortified monasteries and castles and prevent their becoming strongholds of the Swabian League. Those who didn&#x27;t attack the Black Company were left unharmed during these actions. But in Schweinsberg, Swabia, another company, led by peasant leader Jaecklein Rohrbach, executed about 50 local knights after they had opened fire on two negotiators. Geyer disapproved of this slaughtering and moved his troops back to Franconia to continue the fight. But Rohrbach&#x27;s action had sealed the fate of captured peasants and of Geyer&#x27;s men. From that time on, Georg, (&quot;Steward&quot;) of Waldburg, commander of the Swabian League, showed little mercy to the Black Company and hunted them down ruthlessly throughout Swabia. Rohrbach himself was burned alive when he was captured in 1525.

In the Battle of Ingolstadt, in May 1525, the Black Company found itself alone against the forces of the Swabian League after its allies had been destroyed. The Black Company fought its way back to Ingolstadt and occupied the ruins of the castle, the main buildings of which the members of the Company had themselves burned down some months before. The troops of the League encircled the castle and started their attack. The castle&#x27;s occupants fought off two assaults but during the third attack, and after the League&#x27;s heavy artillery breached the massive walls, they were killed.

Geyer himself wasn&#x27;t there during the last battle. He waited for an escort in Rothenburg, but was banned from the city before it arrived. Geyer traveled North and was robbed and killed by two servants of his brother-in-law Wilhelm von Grumbach in the night of June 9–10 in the forest near Rimpar.

==Legacy==
The Black Company has remained very popular to the present day, although Swabian rulers did everything to nullify its fame in the years after the uprising, through publishing a number of &quot;facts&quot; about the crimes the peasants supposedly had committed.

The actions of the Black Company has been memorialised in the song &quot;Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen&quot;, a World War I-era composition by Fritz Sotke with lyrics from Heinrich von Reder. The song has a strong anti-clerical and anti-noble theme, and it remains popular in modern day Germany, with contemporary bands offering different performances and reinterpretations of the lyrics.

<text>The Notobranchaeidae, or &quot;naked sea butterflies&quot;, are a taxonomic family of floating sea slugs, specifically under the subclass Opistobranchia, also called &quot;sea angels&quot;.

Similar to other Pteropods, these pelagic marine heterobranch gastropod mollusks are holoplanktonic.

==Morphology==
While they are not particularly strong swimmers, the foot of these organisms is modified into wing-like structures, called parapodia that they employ for locomotion. Additionally, like other Pteropods of the order Gymnosomata, Notobrachaeidae lack shells entirely as adults. However, they do possess a shell earlier on in their lives. They are also defined by how they possess a posterior gill, strong jaws, grasping tentacles that frequently possess suckers resembling those of cephalopods, and usually buccal cones as well.

==Behavior==
Like other members of the clade Gymnosomata, Notobrachaeidae are highly specialized holoplanktonic carnivores. In other words, they spend their entire lives hunting in the water column and cannot swim against the column. Also like other members of this clade, Notobrachaeidae feed are very specific prey, with a species in this clade usually specializing in hunting one specific genus of thecosomes, which are also known as &quot;sea butterflies,&quot; and form a sister clade to Gymnosomata with the primary difference being how adults of that clade possess shells into adulthood while Gymnosomata do not.

==Distribution==
Members of this family are found globally throughout the upper reaches of the water column, in the pelagic zone, most commonly the epipelagic zone. Following the trend of Pteropods in general, they tend to have the highest species diversity tropical and subtropical latitudes but are less abundant under these conditions. Conversely, they are more abundant but possess less variety in terms of species closer to the north and south poles. However, even in the tropics, they generally appear in high concentrations, resulting in their frequently playing important roles in planktonic food webs.

==Genera and species==
Genera and species in the family Notobranchaeidae include:

Genus: Notobranchaea 
* &quot;Notobranchaea bleekerae&quot; 
** Distribution : Oceanic
* &quot;Notobranchaea grandis&quot;

<text>Henry Grow, Jr. (October 1, 1817 – November 4, 1891) was a Latter-day Saint (Mormon) builder and civil engineer in pioneer-era Utah. His most notable achievement was aiding the construction of the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. Grow engineered the meeting hall&#x27;s unique elongated dome roof.

==Biography==
Grow was the seventh child of Henry Grow and Mary Riter Grow. Born in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, he spent his childhood on his father&#x27;s sixty acre (240,000 m²) farm. This farm was one of five bequeathed by Grow&#x27;s German grandfather, Frederick Grow, to each of his children.

In his early adulthood, Grow was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner for the Norristown and Germantown railroads. He eventually superintended the construction of all bridges under George G. Whitmore, president of the railroads and ex-mayor of Philadelphia.

In May 1842, Grow was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; he traveled to church headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1843. Grow worked on the Nauvoo Temple until its completion in May 1846. By that time, church leader Joseph Smith had long been assassinated by a mob, and the church had schismed as Mormons were being driven from Nauvoo.

Following the leadership of Brigham Young, Grow traveled across the Great Plains to Utah in 1851 as part of the James Cummings Company. He arrived in Salt Lake Valley on October 1, 1851, his 34th birthday.

Grow settled north of present-day Ogden, Utah, but was called to Salt Lake City by Young in 1852 to oversee construction projects for Utah Territory and for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1853, Grow designed and built the first suspension bridge in Utah, over the Weber River. He was also superintendent for the construction of the original Sugar House sugar beet mill under the direction of Bishop Fred Kesler. From 1854 to 1861, Grow built or rebuilt at least five sawmills, mostly in Big Cottonwood Canyon. He also worked on a cotton mill and built more bridges, over the Provo and Jordan Rivers. The Jordan River Bridge, finished in 1861, employed the patented Remington bridge lattice similar to other bridges he helped construct in Pennsylvania.

From 1876 to 1877, Grow served a mission for the church in Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, where he was able to visit old relatives. Upon his return to Salt Lake City, he was assigned to tear down the so-called &quot;old Tabernacle&quot; that stood on Temple Square and superintended the construction of the Salt Lake Assembly Hall under Obed Taylor. Grow built several residences, including a house for church president John Taylor, and acted as superintendent of carpentry of the church through the 1880s. Grow&#x27;s last important project was the construction of the Deseret Paper Mill for the LDS Church-owned &quot;Deseret News&quot; newspaper.

===Salt Lake Tabernacle===
In the early 1860s, Young tapped Grow for what became Grow&#x27;s largest and most famous construction, the dome of the Salt Lake Tabernacle. Young had become infatuated with the idea of constructing the Tabernacle in an elongated dome shape. When asked how large a roof he could construct using a Remington bridge-style lattice, Grow replied that it could be &quot;100 feet wide and as long as is wanted.&quot; Grow engineered the tabernacle roof to be across and long.

Construction of the Tabernacle began on July 26, 1864, but construction of the roof did not begin until 1865 when all 44 supporting sandstone piers designed by William H. Folsom were in place. Grow rapidly built the roof structure from the center out, but encountered difficulty engineering the semicircular ends of the roof. This difficulty dragged structural work on the roof into fall of 1866 even as other parts of the roof were being shingled. However, Grow finished and shingled the entire roof by the spring of 1867, before the interior of the building was finished. He continued to superintend the construction of the building until it was finished.

==Personal life==
A polygamist, Grow had seven wives, of which only four bore children. Chronologically in order of marriage, his wives who had children were Mary Moyer, Ann Elliott, Ann Midgley, and Julia Veach. They bore him seven, eight, one, and seventeen children respectively.

Notable descendants of Grow include C. Scott Grow and Marlin K. Jensen, general authorities of the LDS Church. In 2012, Grow and Jensen helped plan a large-scale reunion of more than 3,000 descendants of Henry Grow.

<text>A blood chit () is a notice carried by military personnel and addressed to any civilians who may come across an armed-services member – such as a shot-down pilot – in difficulties. As well as identifying the force to which the bearer belongs as friendly, the notice displays a message requesting that the service member be rendered every assistance.

==Etymology==

Alternative names are escape flag and identification flag (). &quot;Chit&quot; is a British English term for a small document, note or pass, representing a debt to be paid; it is an Anglo-Indian word dating from the late 18th century, derived from Hindi &quot;citthi&quot;.

==History==
The first blood chit may have been made in 1793 when French balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard demonstrated his hot air balloon in the United States. Because he could not control the direction of the balloon, no one knew where he would land. Because Blanchard did not speak English, George Washington, according to legend, gave him a letter that said that all U.S. citizens were obliged to assist him to return to Philadelphia.

In World War I, British Royal Flying Corps pilots in India and Mesopotamia carried a &quot;goolie chit&quot; printed in four local languages that promised a reward to anyone who would bring an unharmed British aviator back to British lines. The British officer John Masters recorded in his autobiography that Pathan women in the North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955) of British India (now modern day Pakistan) during the Anglo-Afghan Wars would behead and castrate non Muslim soldiers who were captured, like British and Sikhs.

In the Second Sino-Japanese War prior to World War II, foreign volunteer pilots of Flying Tigers carried notices printed in Chinese that informed the locals that this foreign pilot was fighting for China and they were obliged to help them. A text from one such blood chit translates as follows:
I am an American airman.
My plane is destroyed.
I cannot speak your language.
I am an enemy of the Japanese.
Please give me food
and take me to the nearest Allied military post.
You will be rewarded.

On the UN chit from the Korean War, it is written in Japanese that cooperators will be rewarded and should help for his own &#x27;benefit&#x27;.

===United States Armed Forces===

When the U.S. officially entered World War II in December 1941, flight crew survival kits included blood chits printed in 50 different languages that sported an American flag and promised a reward for a safe return of a pilot. The kit might also include gifts like gold coins, maps or sewing needles. Many U.S. flight crews that flew over Asia had their &quot;blood chit&quot; sewn to the back of their flight jackets. Some units added the blood chit to the crew&#x27;s flight suits while other units gave the blood chit out only for specific flights. Currently, blood chits are a product of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency. These recent government-issue items are a small sheet of Tyvek material with an American flag and a statement in several languages indicating that the U.S. will reward anyone assisting the bearer to safety. They constitute a written promise of the US Government. Retired General Norman Schwarzkopf recounted that the CENTCOM Judge Advocate General during the Gulf War forward his approval for US pilots to carry such a chit.

===British Armed Forces===

Examples of blood chits issued to British RAF personnel in India in the 1940s are printed on thin sheets of silk cloth measuring 20 by 11½ inches (about 50 x 30 cm); they have the Union flag printed at the top left, and the following text in English and French alongside it:

The main area of the document is printed in three columns with the same text in 15 Asian languages, including Malay, Burmese, Tamil, Thai and Bengali.

Such blood chits or goolie chits were issued to Royal Air Force pilots during the Gulf War. It identifies the bearer as friendly and is issued with gold sovereigns as an incentive. Peter Ratcliffe recounted that it was issued to Special Air Service troopers prior to deployment. The gold sovereigns had to be returned unless troopers could prove they were legitimately used. Peter de la Billière also recounted that all RAF aircrew were issued with &quot;£800 in gold, to facilitate escape in case of trouble, and also a chit written in Arabic which promised that Her Majesty’s Government would pay the sum of £5000 to anyone who returned an airman intact to the Allies.&quot; Former Special Air Service Sergeant Chris Ryan also received the same type of chit and gave it to a Syrian driver during his escape from Iraq.

=== Americans during the Cold War ===
During the Cold War, Americans flying reconnaissance over Eastern Bloc countries would be given blood chits in those various languages (e.g. Polish, Czech, and Hungarian) The chits read:

I am an American. I do not speak your language. I need food, shelter and assistance. I will not harm you; I have no malice toward your people. If you help me, my government will reward you.

===Norwegian Armed Forces===
Norwegian commandos (&quot;spesialjegere&quot;) had chits—during the War in Afghanistan—&quot;in silk, sewn on the inside of the uniform belt.

<text>are Japanese divers famous for collecting pearls, though traditionally their main catch is seafood. The vast majority of are women.

==Terminology==
There are several sea occupations that are pronounced &quot;ama&quot; and several words that refer to sea occupation.

* – a sea-diving fisherwoman
* – a sea-diving fisherman
* , – a sea-diving fisherperson of either gender
* &quot;uminchu&quot; () – a sea fisherperson of either gender in Okinawan

While one definition of ama specifically refers to divers, another definition refers to fisherpersons in general.

==History==
Japanese tradition holds that the practice of may be 2,000 years old.
Records of female pearl divers, or , date back as early as AD 927 in Japan&#x27;s Heian period. Early were known to dive for seafood and were honored with the task of retrieving abalone for shrines and imperial emperors. traditionally wear white, as the colour represents purity and also to possibly ward off sharks. Traditionally and even as recently as the 1960s, dived wearing only a loincloth, but in the 20th century, the divers adopted an all-white sheer diving uniform in order to be more presentable while diving. Even in modern times, dive without scuba gear or air tanks, making them a traditional sort of freediver.

Pearl diving were considered rare in the early years of diving. However, Mikimoto Kōkichi&#x27;s discovery and production of the cultured pearl in 1893 produced a great demand for . He established the Mikimoto Pearl Island in Toba and used the &#x27;s findings to grow his business internationally. Nowadays, the pearl-diving are viewed as a tourist attraction at Mikimoto Pearl Island. The number of continue to dwindle as this ancient technique becomes less and less practiced, due to disinterest in the new generation of women and the dwindling demand for their activity. In the 1940s, 6,000 were reported active along the coasts of Japan, while today practice at numbers more along the scale of 60 or 70 divers in a generation.

==Activities==
Women began diving as as early as 12 and 13 years old, taught by elder . Despite their early start, divers are known to be active well into their 70s and are rumored to live longer due to their diving training and discipline. In Japan, women were considered to be superior divers due to the distribution of their fat and their ability to hold their breath. The garments of the have changed throughout time, from the original loincloth to the white sheer garbs and eventually to the modern diving wetsuit.
Duty and superstition mark the world of the . One traditional article of clothing that has stood the test of time is the headscarf. The headscarves are adorned with symbols such as the and the , which have the function of bringing luck to the diver and warding off evil. The are also known to create small shrines near their diving location where they will visit after diving in order to thank the gods for their safe return.

The were expected to endure harsh conditions while diving, such as freezing temperatures and great pressures from the depths of the sea. Through the practice, many were noted to lose weight during the months of diving seasons. practiced a breathing technique in which the divers would release air in a long whistle once they resurfaced from a dive. This whistling became a defining characteristic of the , as this technique is unique to them.

Located in the Spree-Neiße district, Guben has a population of 20,049. It is a divided city on the border between Germany and Poland, having been separated into Guben and Gubin in 1945.

== Geography ==

=== Environment ===
Guben is located in the district (Landkreis) of Spree-Neiße in the southeast of the state of Brandenburg. It is in the historical region of Lower Lusatia. Guben&#x27;s position on the banks of the Lusatian Neisse between two plateaus was advantageous in its early economic development. These plateaus developed from ground moraines of the Wisconsin glaciation period. Both the western (&quot;Kaltenborner Berge&quot; = Kaltenborn Hills) and eastern (&quot;Gubener Berge&quot; = Guben Hills) ended up as terminal moraines. The surrounding land is covered with pine forests and lakes.

=== Districts ===
Guben is divided into the unofficial sections of:
*&quot;Altstadt&quot;, formerly to 1945 &quot;Klostervorstadt&quot; (developed from the early Benedictine cloister area, which developed into the industrial suburb of pre-division Guben)
*&quot;Sprucke&quot; (originally &quot;Vorwerk Altsprucke&quot;, added after 1920 with quarter &quot;Neusprucke&quot; and after 1963 with quarter &quot;Obersprucke&quot;)
*&quot;Reichenbach&quot;

Guben is divided into the official districts (with district mayors) of:
*&quot;Bresinchen&quot;
*&quot;Deulowitz&quot;
*&quot;Groß Breesen&quot; (with &quot;Grunewald&quot;)
*&quot;Kaltenborn&quot;
*&quot;Schlagsdorf&quot;

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms of Guben depicts a red wall with three gates (Klostertor, Crossener Tor, Werdertor) and three towers. The three inescutcheons depict the arms of the historic rulers: the Kings of Prussia, the Kings of Bohemia, and the Electors of Saxony. The coat of arms of the Polish sister city Gubin features a Piast Eagle inescutcheon instead.

== History ==

===Medieval and early modern period===

The trade settlement existed since the 11th century. In the early 11th century it became part of the early Polish state under Bolesław I the Brave, and later it fell to the March of Lusatia. Gubin began to develop around 1200 as a trade and marketplace on the roads between Leipzig and Poznań and between Görlitz and Frankfurt (Oder). In the early 13th century it was part of the Duchy of Silesia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, and it was mentioned under the name &quot;Gubin&quot; in a document of Duke Henry the Bearded in 1211. Lost by Poland in 1224, afterwards it often changed affiliation. A settlement on the eastern shore of the Lusatian Neisse was protected by swamps to the south and by the Lubsza, a tributary of the Neisse, to the north and the east. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, granted this settlement Magdeburg rights on June 1, 1235, and declared it an oppidum (town). On the western shore of the river, a cloister of Benedictine nuns began developing as an outlying suburb of the town on the eastern shore of the river. In a charter of 1312 Guben received its coat of arms displaying three towers. In 1319 the town was unsuccessfully besieged by King John of Bohemia, and afterwards it fell to the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg, before it was captured by House of Wittelsbach in 1324. It was regained by the Silesian Piasts in 1362, and in 1364 and 1367 Duke Bolko II the Small confirmed old privileges of Gubin.

In 1368 the town passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia, in 1469 it passed under Hungarian suzerainty, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia. The town was fortified in the 14th century with earthworks, trenches, and wooden planking, and then refortified from 1523 to 1544. In 1635 Elector John George I of Saxony received Lower Lusatia and Guben in the Peace of Prague.

=== Growth of economy and infrastructure ===
Guben&#x27;s textile industry began to develop in the 16th century, although it began to flourish in the 19th century, especially with leather gloves in 1849. Beginning in 1822, Guben&#x27;s production of hats covered 65% of German demand. Later industrialization led to the production of rugs and shoes. Lignite processing began in the eastern half of the city in 1847. The tradition for weaving is still prevalent in modern times as the textile company Trevira maintains a manufacturing plant in the city.

Guben station was opened with the railway between Frankfurt (Oder) and Breslau (Wrocław) in 1846 and the Cottbus–Guben railway was opened in 1871. A direct line to Forst (Lausitz) was finished in 1904, and a tram line ran in the city from February 24, 1904, until June 8, 1938.

In 1815 the Margravate of Lower Lusatia was abolished and replaced with the district system. Guben became the capital of a district within the Province of Brandenburg. On April 1, 1884, the city of Guben separated from the district of Guben and became its own urban district. On December 1, 1928, the region of Mückenberg was incorporated from the district of Guben into the city of Guben.

Most recently the Anatomist Doctor Gunther von Hagens, from Heidelberg University where he developed many of his cadaver plastinating techniques, has purchased a disused woolens manufacturing factory. This has been renovated and converted into a museum-cum-work centre. He expects to employ approximately 200 people, which will have some impact on the local unemployment figures currently running at close to 20%

There have been some objections to this development on moral grounds, but the majority of the Guben&#x27;s population see this development as a good thing for the future prosperity of Guben.

=== After World War II ===

At the Potsdam Conference at the end of World War II in 1945, the boundary between Germany and Poland was fixed as the Oder–Neisse line. Because Guben was on the Lusatian Neisse, the city was separated into German Guben and Polish Gubin.

Because the historical center of Guben became Gubin, the western suburbs which grew from the Benedictine cloister remained in Guben. Although underdeveloped compared to the town across the river, the remaining Guben began to grow extensively after 1945, especially through the construction of a chemical plant and additional residential areas. From 1952 to 1990, Guben was part of the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany. From 1961 to 1990 Guben was officially named &quot;Wilhelm-Pieck-Stadt Guben&quot; by East Germany after its first and only State President Wilhelm Pieck, who was born in the eastern half of the city (today&#x27;s Gubin) in 1876. From June 1950 until July 23, 1952, Guben was part of the district of Cottbus.
=== Reunification ===
The German reunification in 1990 brought economic depression and unemployment to the city. When the district of Guben was abolished on December 6, 1993, Guben became part of the district of Spree-Neiße. In recent years the city has begun developing closer ties with Gubin across the river.

<doc id="703940" wikidata="Q330882" url="?curid=703940" title="Gregor MacGregor">
<text>General Gregor MacGregor (24 December 1786 – 4 December 1845) was a Scottish soldier, adventurer, and confidence trickster who attempted from 1821 to 1837 to draw British and French investors and settlers to &quot;Poyais&quot;, a fictional Central American territory that he claimed to rule as &quot;Cazique&quot;. Hundreds invested their savings in supposed Poyaisian government bonds and land certificates, while about 250 emigrated to MacGregor&#x27;s invented country in 1822–23 to find only an untouched jungle; more than half of them died. Seen as a contributory factor to the &quot;Panic of 1825&quot;, MacGregor&#x27;s Poyais scheme has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history.

From the Clan Gregor, MacGregor was an officer in the British Army from 1803 to 1810; he served in the Peninsular War. He joined the republican side in the Venezuelan War of Independence in 1812, quickly became a general and, over the next four years, operated against the Spanish on behalf of both Venezuela and its neighbour New Granada. His successes included a difficult month-long fighting retreat through northern Venezuela in 1816. He captured Amelia Island in 1817 under a mandate from revolutionary agents to conquer Florida from the Spanish, and there proclaimed a short-lived &quot;Republic of the Floridas&quot;. He then oversaw two calamitous operations in New Granada during 1819 that each ended with his abandoning British volunteer troops under his command.

On his return to Britain in 1821, MacGregor claimed that King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast in the Gulf of Honduras had created him Cazique of Poyais, which he described as a developed colony with a community of British settlers. When the British press reported on MacGregor&#x27;s deception following the return of fewer than 50 survivors in late 1823, some of his victims leaped to his defence, insisting that the general had been let down by those whom he had put in charge of the emigration party. A French court tried MacGregor and three others for fraud in 1826 after he attempted a variation on the scheme there, but convicted only one of his associates. Acquitted, MacGregor attempted lesser Poyais schemes in London over the next decade. In 1838, he moved to Venezuela, where he was welcomed back as a hero. He died in Caracas in 1845, aged 58, and was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral.

==Early life==
===Family and childhood===

Gregor MacGregor was born on Christmas Eve 1786 at his family&#x27;s ancestral home of Glengyle, on the north shore of Loch Katrine in Stirlingshire, Scotland. He was the son of Daniel MacGregor, an East India Company sea captain, and his wife Ann (&quot;née&quot; Austin). The family was Roman Catholic and part of the Clan Gregor, whose proscription by King James VI and I in 1604 had been repealed only in 1774. During the proscription on their faith, the MacGregors had been legally ostracised to the extent that they were forbidden to use their own surname—many of them, including Gregor&#x27;s celebrated great-great-uncle Rob Roy, had participated in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. MacGregor would assert in adulthood that a direct ancestor of his had survived the Darien scheme of 1698, the ill-fated Scottish attempt to colonise the Isthmus of Panama. Gregor&#x27;s grandfather, also called Gregor and nicknamed &quot;the Beautiful&quot;, served with distinction in the British Army under the surname Drummond, and subsequently played an important role in the clan&#x27;s restoration and rehabilitation into society.

Little is recorded of MacGregor&#x27;s childhood. After his father&#x27;s death in 1794, he and his two sisters were raised primarily by his mother with the help of various relatives. MacGregor&#x27;s biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair considers it plausible, citing MacGregor&#x27;s apparent sophistication and his mother&#x27;s connections in Edinburgh.

===British Army===
MacGregor joined the British Army at 16, the youngest age it was possible for him to do so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, probably for around £450. MacGregor&#x27;s entrance to the military coincided with the start of the Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th Foot was at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant — an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion, the 57th Foot was posted to Gibraltar.
MacGregor was introduced to Maria Bowater, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral, around 1804. Maria commanded a substantial dowry and, apart from her by-now-deceased father, was related to two generals, a member of parliament and the botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. Gregor and Maria married at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster in June 1805 and set up home in London, at the residence of the bride&#x27;s aunt. Two months later, having rejoined the 57th Foot in Gibraltar, MacGregor bought the rank of captain for about £900, choosing not to wait the seven years such a promotion might take without purchase. The 57th Foot remained in Gibraltar between 1805 and 1809. During this time MacGregor developed an obsession with dress, rank insignia and medals that made him unpopular in the regiment; he forbade any enlisted man or non-commissioned officer to leave his quarters in anything less than full dress uniform.

In 1809 the 57th Foot was sent to Portugal as reinforcements for the Anglo-Portuguese Army under the Duke of Wellington, during his second attempt to drive the French out of Spain during the Peninsular War. MacGregor&#x27;s regiment disembarked at Lisbon about three months into the campaign, on 15 July. By September it was garrisoning Elvas, near the frontier with Spain. Soon thereafter MacGregor was seconded to the 8th Line Battalion of the Portuguese Army, where he served with the rank of major from October 1809 to April 1810. According to Michael Rafter, author of a highly critical 1820 biography of MacGregor, this secondment came after a disagreement between MacGregor and a superior officer, &quot;originally of a trivial nature&quot;, that intensified to such an extent that the young captain was forced to request discharge. This was promptly granted. MacGregor formally retired from the British service on 24 May 1810, receiving back the £1,350 he had paid for the ranks of ensign and captain, and returned to Britain. The 57th Foot&#x27;s actions at the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811 would earn it considerable prestige and the nickname &quot;the Die-Hards&quot;; MacGregor would thereafter make much of his association—despite having left the regiment one year prior.

===Edinburgh to Caracas===
On his return to Britain the 23-year-old MacGregor and his wife moved into a house rented by his mother in Edinburgh. There he assumed the title of &quot;Colonel&quot;, wore the badge of a Portuguese knightly order and toured the city in an extravagant and brightly coloured coach. After failing to attain high social status in Edinburgh, MacGregor moved back to London in 1811 and began styling himself &quot;Sir Gregor MacGregor, Bart.&quot;, falsely claiming to have succeeded to the MacGregor clan chieftainship; he also alluded to family ties with a selection of dukes, earls and barons. This had little bearing on reality but MacGregor nevertheless created an air of credible respectability for himself in London society.

In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At a stroke MacGregor lost his main source of income and the support of the influential Bowater family. His options were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria&#x27;s death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.

MacGregor&#x27;s interest was aroused by the colonial revolts against Spanish rule in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, where seven of the ten provinces had declared themselves an independent republic in July 1811, starting the Venezuelan War of Independence. The Venezuelan revolutionary General Francisco de Miranda had been feted in London society during his recent visit, and may have met MacGregor. 

Noting the treatment London&#x27;s highest circles gave to Miranda, MacGregor formed the idea that exotic adventures in the New World might earn him similar celebrity on his homecoming. He sold the small Scottish estate he had inherited from his father and grandfather and sailed for South America in early 1812. On the way he stopped in Jamaica, where according to Rafter he was tempted to settle among the planters and traders, but &quot;having no introductory letters to that place, he was not received into society&quot;. After a comfortable sojourn in Kingston, he sailed for Venezuela and disembarked at La Guaira in April 1812.

==South America==
===Venezuela, under Miranda===

MacGregor arrived in the Venezuelan capital Caracas a fortnight after much of the city had been destroyed by an earthquake. With swathes of the country under the control of advancing royalist armies, the revolutionary government was losing support and starting to fracture. MacGregor dropped his pretended Scottish baronetcy, reasoning that it might undermine the republican credentials he hoped to establish, but continued to style himself &quot;Sir Gregor&quot; on the basis that he was, he claimed, a knight of the Portuguese Order of Christ. He offered his services directly to Miranda in Caracas. As a former British Army officer—from the famous &quot;Die-Hards&quot;, no less—he was received with alacrity and given command of a cavalry battalion with the rank of colonel. In his first action, MacGregor and his cavalry routed a royalist force west of Maracay, between Valencia and Caracas. Subsequent engagements were less successful, but the republican leaders were still pleased with the glamour they perceived this dashing Scottish officer to give their cause.

MacGregor married Josefa Antonia Andrea Aristeguieta y Lovera, daughter of a prominent Caracas family and a cousin of the revolutionary Simón Bolívar, in Maracay on 10 June 1812. By the end of that month Miranda had promoted MacGregor to brigadier-general, but the revolutionary cause was failing; in July, after the royalists took the key port of Puerto Cabello from Bolívar, the republic capitulated. In the chaos that ensued Miranda was captured by the Spanish while the remnants of the republican leadership, including MacGregor with Josefa in tow, were evacuated to the Dutch island of Curaçao aboard a British brig, the &quot;Sapphire&quot;. Bolívar joined them there later in the year.

===New Granada; defence of Cartagena===
With Miranda imprisoned in Spain, Bolívar emerged as the new leader of the Venezuelan independence movement. He resolved that they would have to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Curaçao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General Antonio Nariño&#x27;s republican armies in Venezuela&#x27;s western neighbour, New Granada. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nariño&#x27;s base at Tunja in the eastern Andes. Miranda&#x27;s name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nariño&#x27;s forces were mainly engaged around Popayán in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison. Rafter reports positively on MacGregor&#x27;s conduct in Socorro, writing that &quot;by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [he] considerably improved the discipline of the troops&quot;, but some under his command disliked him. An official in Cúcuta, the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: &quot;I am sick and tired of this bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us.&quot;
While MacGregor was in the New Granadian service, Bolívar raised a force of Venezuelan exiles and local troops in the port of Cartagena de Indias, and captured Caracas on 4 August 1813. The royalists quickly rallied and crushed Bolívar&#x27;s second republic in mid-1814. Nariño&#x27;s New Granadian nationalists surrendered around the same time. MacGregor withdrew to Cartagena, which was still in revolutionary hands, and at the head of native troops destroyed hamlets, local infrastructure and produce to prevent the Spanish from using them. A Spanish force of about 6,000 landed in late August 1815 and lay siege to the city. After repeatedly failing to overcome the 5,000 defenders, they deployed to subdue the fortress by blockade. Sinclair records that MacGregor played an &quot;honourable, though not conspicuous&quot; part in the defence. 

By November 1815, there remained in Cartagena de Indias only a few hundred men capable of fighting. The defenders with the aid of the French corsair Louis-Michel Aury resolved to use the dozen gunboats they had to break through the Spanish fleet to the open sea, abandoning the city to the royalists; MacGregor was chosen as one of the three commanders of this operation. On the night of 5 December 1815, the gunboats sailed out into the bay, blasted their way through the smaller Spanish vessels and, avoiding the frigates, made for Jamaica. All the gunboats escaped.

===Venezuela, under Bolívar===
The British merchant class in Jamaica that had shunned MacGregor on his first arrival in 1812 now welcomed him as a hero. The Scotsman entertained many dinner parties with embellished accounts of his part in the Cartagena siege, leading some to understand that he had personally headed the city&#x27;s defence. One Englishman toasted the &quot;Hannibal of modern Carthage&quot;. Around New Year 1816, MacGregor and his wife made their way to Santo Domingo (today the Dominican Republic), where Bolívar was raising a new army. Bolívar received MacGregor back into the Venezuelan Army with the rank of brigadier-general, and included him in an expeditionary force that left Aux Cayes (now Les Cayes) on 30 April 1816. MacGregor took part in the capture of the port town of Carúpano as second-in-command of Manuel Piar&#x27;s column, but is not mentioned in the record of the battle prepared by Bolívar&#x27;s staff. After the Spanish were driven from many central Venezuelan towns, MacGregor was sent to the coast west of Caracas to recruit native tribesmen in July 1816. On 18 July, eight days after the numerically superior royalists countered and broke Bolívar&#x27;s main force at La Cabrera, MacGregor resolved to retreat hundreds of miles east to Barcelona.

Two pursuing royalist armies harried MacGregor constantly as he retreated across country, but failed to break his rearguard. With no carts and only a handful of horses, the Scotsman was forced to leave his wounded where they fell. Late on 27 July, MacGregor&#x27;s way east was obstructed by a royalist force at Chaguaramas, south of Caracas and about a third of the distance to Barcelona. MacGregor led his men in a furious charge that prompted a Spanish retreat back into Chaguaramas, then continued towards Barcelona. The Spanish remained in the town until 30 July, giving MacGregor two days&#x27; head start, and caught up with him only on 10 August. The Scotsman deployed his 1,200 men, mostly native archers, behind a marsh and a stream—the Spanish cavalry were bogged down in the marsh, while the archers repelled the infantry with volleys of arrows. After three hours MacGregor charged and routed the royalists. MacGregor&#x27;s party was helped the rest of the way east to Barcelona by elements of the main revolutionary army. They arrived on 20 August 1816, after 34 days&#x27; march.

In Rafter&#x27;s view, this marked &quot;the zenith of MacGregor&#x27;s celebrity&quot; in South America. He had, according to his biographer Frank Griffith Dawson, &quot;led his troops with brilliant success&quot;; Sinclair agrees, calling the march a &quot;remarkable feat&quot; demonstrating &quot;genuine military skill&quot;. With Bolívar back in Aux Cayes, overall command of the republican armies in Venezuela had been given to Piar. On 26 September, Piar and MacGregor defeated the Spanish army commanded by Francisco Tomás Morales at El Juncal. But MacGregor and Piar had several disagreements over the strategic conduct of the war—according to the American historian David Bushnell, the Scottish general probably &quot;r[an] afoul of personal and factional rivalries within the patriot camp&quot;. In early October 1816, MacGregor left with Josefa for Margarita Island, about off eastern Venezuela, where he hoped to enter the service of General Juan Bautista Arismendi. 

Soon afterward, he received an acclamatory letter from Bolívar: &quot;The retreat which you had the honour to conduct is in my opinion superior to the conquest of an empire ... Please accept my congratulations for the prodigious services you have rendered my country&quot;. MacGregor&#x27;s march to Barcelona would remain prominent in the South American revolutionary narrative for years. The retreat also earned him the title of &quot;Xenophon of the Americas&quot; ().

===Florida republic; Amelia Island affair===
Arismendi proposed to MacGregor that capturing one of the ports in East or West Florida, which were then Spanish colonies, might provide an excellent springboard for republican operations elsewhere in Latin America. MacGregor liked the idea and, after an abortive attempt to recruit in Haiti, sailed with Josefa to the United States to raise money and volunteers. Soon after he left in early 1817, a further congratulatory letter arrived in Margarita from Bolívar, promoting MacGregor to divisional general, awarding him the &quot;Orden de los Libertadores&quot; (Order of the Liberators), and asking him to return to Venezuela. MacGregor remained ignorant of this for two years. On 31 March 1817 in Philadelphia, MacGregor received a document from Lino de Clemente, Pedro Gual, and Martin Thompson, each of whom claimed to speak for one or more of the Latin American republics. They called themselves the &quot;deputies of free America&quot; and called upon MacGregor to take possession of &quot;both the Floridas, East and West&quot; as soon as possible. Florida&#x27;s proposed fate was not specified; MacGregor presumed that the Floridians would seek US annexation, as they were mostly of non-Spanish origin, and that the US would quickly comply. He thus expected at least covert support from the US government.

MacGregor raised several hundred armed men for this enterprise in the Mid-Atlantic states, South Carolina, and particularly Savannah, Georgia. He also raised $160,000 by the sale of &quot;scripts&quot; to investors, promising them fertile acres in Florida or their money back with interest. He determined to first attack Fernandina, a small settlement with a fine harbor at the very northern tip of Amelia Island, which contained about 40% of East Florida&#x27;s population (recorded as 3,729 in 1815). He expected little to no resistance from the tiny Spanish garrison there. MacGregor left Charleston in a ship with fewer than 80 men, mostly US citizens. He led the landing party personally on 29 June 1817 with the words: &quot;I shall sleep either in hell or Amelia tonight!&quot; The Spanish commander at Fort San Carlos, with 51 men and several cannon, vastly overestimated the size of MacGregor&#x27;s force and surrendered without either side firing a shot.
Few of Amelia&#x27;s residents came out to support MacGregor but, at the same time, there was little resistance; most simply left for mainland Florida or Georgia. MacGregor raised a flag showing a green cross on a white field—the &quot;Green Cross of Florida&quot;—and issued a proclamation on 30 June urging the island&#x27;s inhabitants to return and support him. This was largely ignored, as was a second proclamation in which MacGregor congratulated his men on their victory and exhorted them to &quot;free the whole of the Floridas from Tyranny and oppression&quot;.

MacGregor announced a &quot;Republic of the Floridas&quot; under a government headed by himself. He attempted to tax the local pirates&#x27; booty at an &quot;admiralty court&quot;, and tried to raise money by seizing and selling dozens of slaves found on the island. Morale among the troops plummeted when he prohibited looting. Most of his recruits were still in the US; American authorities prevented most of them from leaving port, and MacGregor was able to muster only 200 on Amelia. His officers clamoured for an invasion of mainland Florida, but he insisted that they did not have enough men, arms, or supplies. Bushnell suggests that MacGregor&#x27;s backers in the US may have promised him more support in these regards than they ultimately provided. Eighteen men sent to reconnoitre around St Augustine in late July 1817 were variously killed, wounded, or captured by the Spanish. Discipline disintegrated among MacGregor&#x27;s troops, who were paid first in &quot;Amelia dollars&quot; that he had printed, and later not at all.

Spanish forces congregated on the mainland opposite Amelia, and MacGregor and most of his officers decided on 3 September 1817 that the situation was hopeless and that they would abandon the venture. MacGregor announced to the men that he was leaving, explaining vaguely that he had been &quot;deceived by my friends.&quot; He turned over the command to one of his subordinates, a former Pennsylvania congressman named Jared Irwin, and he boarded the &quot;Morgiana&quot; with his wife on 4 September 1817 with an angry crowd looking on and hurling insults at him. He waited offshore for a few days, then left on the schooner &quot;Venus&quot; on 8 September. Two weeks later, the MacGregors arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas, where he arranged to have commemorative medallions struck bearing the Green Cross motif and the Latin inscriptions &quot;Amalia Veni Vidi Vici&quot; (&quot;Amelia, I Came, I Saw, I Conquered&quot;) and &quot;Duce Mac Gregorio Libertas Floridarium&quot; (&quot;Liberty for the Floridas under the leadership of MacGregor&quot;). He made no attempt to repay those who had funded the Amelia expedition. Irwin&#x27;s troops defeated two Spanish assaults and were then joined by 300 men under Louis-Michel Aury, who held Amelia for three months before surrendering to American forces, who held the island &quot;in trust for Spain&quot; until the Florida Purchase in 1819.

Press reports of the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of misinformation disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the &quot;Venus&quot; was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor&#x27;s attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited by the idea of leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.

===Porto Bello===
The third Venezuelan republic&#x27;s envoy in the British capital borrowed £1,000 for MacGregor to engage and transport British troops for service in Venezuela, but the Scotsman squandered these funds within a few weeks. A London financier, an old friend of MacGregor&#x27;s called Thomas Newte, took responsibility for the envoy&#x27;s debt on the condition that the general instead take troops to New Granada. MacGregor funded his expedition through the sale of commissions at rates cheaper than those offered by the British Army, and assembled enlisted men through a network of recruiters across the British Isles, offering volunteers huge financial incentives. MacGregor sailed for South America on 18 November 1818 aboard a former Royal Navy brigantine, renamed the &quot;Hero&quot;; 50 officers and over 500 troops, many of them Irish, followed the next month. They were critically under-equipped, having virtually no arms or munitions.

The men came close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andrés, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange accommodation for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day.
Colonel Rafter disembarked with 200 men near Porto Bello on 9 April, outflanked a roughly equal force of Spanish defenders during the night, and marched into Porto Bello without a fight on 10 April. MacGregor, watching from one of the ships with Woodbine—to whom he had given the rank of colonel—quickly came ashore when he sighted Rafter&#x27;s signal of victory, and, as usual, issued a flowery proclamation: &quot;Soldiers! Our first conquest has been glorious, it has opened the road to future and additional fame.&quot; Rafter urged MacGregor to march on Panama City, but MacGregor did not make much in the way of plans to continue the campaign. He devoted most of his attention to the particulars of a new chivalric order of his design, the emblem of which would be a Green Cross. The troops became mutinous again after more promised money failed to materialise—MacGregor eventually paid each man $20, but this did little to restore discipline.

The lack of patrolling by MacGregor&#x27;s troops allowed the Spanish to march straight into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor was still in bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned had he not been picked up and brought aboard the &quot;Hero&quot; by one of his naval officers. 

MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the &quot;Hero&quot;, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the &quot;Hero&quot;. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel&#x27;s astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. 

Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor&#x27;s army had no choice but to surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.

===Rio de la Hacha===
Making his way first to San Andrés, then Haiti, MacGregor conferred invented decorations and titles on his officers and planned an expedition to Rio de la Hacha in northern New Granada. He was briefly delayed in Haiti by a falling-out with his naval commander, an officer called Hudson. When the naval officer fell ill, MacGregor had him put ashore, seized the &quot;Hero&quot; — which Hudson owned—and renamed her &quot;El MacGregor&quot;, explaining to the Haitian authorities that &quot;drunkenness, insanity and mutiny&quot; by his captain had forced him to take the ship. MacGregor steered the hijacked brigantine to Aux Cayes, then sold her after she was found to be unseaworthy. Waiting for him in Aux Cayes were 500 officers and enlisted men, courtesy of recruiters in Ireland and London, but he had no ships to carry them and little in the way of equipment. This was remedied during July and August 1819, first by the arrival of his Irish recruiter Colonel Thomas Eyre with 400 men and two ships—MacGregor gave him the rank of general and the Order of the Green Cross—and then by the appearance of war materiel from London, sent by Thomas Newte on a schooner named &quot;Amelia&quot;.

MacGregor bombastically announced his intention to liberate New Granada, but then hesitated. The lack of action, rations or pay for weeks prompted most of the British volunteers to go home. MacGregor&#x27;s force, which had comprised 900 men at its peak (including officers), had dwindled to no more than 250 by the time he directed the &quot;Amelia&quot; and two other vessels to Rio de la Hacha on 29 September 1819. His remaining officers included Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Rafter, who had bought a commission with the hope of rescuing his brother William. After being driven away from Rio de la Hacha harbour by cannon on 4 October, MacGregor ordered a night landing west of the town and said that he would take personal command once the troops were ashore. Lieutenant-Colonel William Norcott led the men onto the beach and waited there two hours for MacGregor to arrive, but the general failed to appear. Attacked by a larger Spanish force, Norcott countered and captured the town. MacGregor still refused to leave the ships, convinced that the flag flying over the fort must be a trick; even when Norcott rowed out to tell him to come into port, MacGregor would not step ashore for over a day. When he did appear, many of his soldiers swore and spat at him. He issued another lofty proclamation, recalled by Rafter as an &quot;aberration of human intellect&quot;, at the foot of which MacGregor identified himself as &quot;His Majesty the Inca of New Granada&quot;.

Events went largely as they had done earlier in the year at Porto Bello. MacGregor abstained from command in all but name, and the troops descended into a state of confused drunkenness. &quot;General MacGregor displayed so palpable a want of the requisite qualities which should distinguish the commander of such an expedition,&quot; Rafter wrote, &quot;that universal astonishment prevailed amongst his followers at the reputation he had for some time maintained.&quot; As Spanish forces gathered around the town, Norcott and Rafter decided the situation was hopeless and left on a captured Spanish schooner on 10 October 1819, taking with them five officers and 27 soldiers and sailors. MacGregor convened his remaining officers the next day and, giving them promotions and Green Cross decorations, exhorted them to help him lead the defence. Immediately afterwards he went to the port, ostensibly to escort Eyre&#x27;s wife and two children to safety on a ship. After putting the Eyres on the &quot;Lovely Ann&quot;, he boarded the &quot;Amelia&quot; and ordered the ships out to sea just as the Spanish attacked. General Eyre and the troops left behind were all killed.

MacGregor reached Aux Cayes to find news of this latest debacle had preceded him, and he was shunned. A friend in Jamaica, Thomas Higson, informed him through letters that Josefa and Gregorio had been evicted, and until Higson&#x27;s intervention had sought sanctuary in a slave&#x27;s hut. MacGregor was wanted in Jamaica for piracy and so could not join his family there. He similarly could not go back to Bolívar, who was so outraged by MacGregor&#x27;s recent conduct that he accused the Scotsman of treason and ordered his death by hanging if he ever set foot on the South American mainland again. MacGregor&#x27;s whereabouts for the half year following October 1819 are unknown. Back in London in June 1820, Michael Rafter published his highly censorious account of MacGregor&#x27;s adventures, &quot;Memoirs of Gregor M&#x27;Gregor&quot;, dedicating the book to his brother Colonel William Rafter and the troops abandoned at Porto Bello and Rio de la Hacha. In his summary Rafter speculated that following the latter episode MacGregor was &quot;politically, though not naturally dead&quot; — &quot;to suppose&quot;, he wrote, &quot;that any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects, would be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable&quot;.

==Poyais scheme==
===Cazique of Poyais===
MacGregor&#x27;s next known location is at the court of King George Frederic Augustus of the Mosquito Coast, at Cape Gracias a Dios on the Gulf of Honduras in April 1820. The Miskito people, descendants of shipwrecked African slaves and indigenous people, shared the historic British antipathy towards Spain, and the British authorities in the region had crowned their most powerful chieftains as &quot;kings&quot; since the 17th century. These were kings in little more than name, with no effective control over the country they ostensibly led; Britain crowned and protected them simply so they could declare the area to be under Mosquito sovereignty and thereby obstruct Spanish claims. There had been a modest British settlement on the coast around the Black River (now the Río Sico), but this had been evacuated following the Anglo-Spanish Convention of 1786. By the 1820s the most visible sign of prior colonisation was a small graveyard overgrown by the jungle.

On 29 April 1820, George Frederic Augustus signed a document granting MacGregor and his heirs a substantial swathe of Mosquito territory—8,000,000 acres (12,500 square miles; 32,375 square kilometres), an area larger than Wales — in exchange for rum and jewellery. The land was pleasing to the eye but unfit for cultivation and could sustain little in the way of livestock. Its area was roughly a triangle with corners at Cape Gracias a Dios, Cape Camarón and the Black River&#x27;s headwaters. MacGregor dubbed this area &quot;Poyais&quot; after the natives of the highlands around the Black River&#x27;s source, the Paya or &quot;Poyer&quot; people (today called the Pech), and in mid-1821 appeared back in London calling himself the Cazique of Poyais—&quot;Cazique&quot;, a Spanish-American word for a native chief, being equivalent in MacGregor&#x27;s usage to &quot;Prince&quot;. He claimed to have been created such by the Mosquito king, but in fact both the title and Poyais were of his own invention.

Despite Rafter&#x27;s book, London society remained largely unaware of MacGregor&#x27;s failures over the past few years, but remembered successes such as his march to Barcelona; similarly his association with the &quot;Die-Hards&quot; of the 57th Foot was recalled, but his dubious early discharge was not. In this climate of a constantly shifting Latin America, where governments rose, fell, and adopted new names from year to year, it did not seem so implausible that there might be a country called Poyais or that a decorated general like MacGregor might be its leader. The Cazique became &quot;a great adornment for the dinner tables and ballrooms of sophisticated London&quot;, Sinclair writes — rumours abounded that he was partially descended from indigenous royalty. His exotic appeal was enhanced by the arrival of the striking &quot;Princess of Poyais&quot;, Josefa, who had given birth to a girl named Josefa Anna Gregoria at MacGregor&#x27;s sister&#x27;s home in Ireland. The MacGregors received countless social invitations, including an official reception at Guildhall from the Lord Mayor of London.

MacGregor said that he had come to London to attend King George IV&#x27;s coronation on the Poyers&#x27; behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—&quot;religious and moral instructors ... and persons to guide and assist you&quot;—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be &quot;Vice-Cazique&quot; during his absence. &quot;POYERS!&quot;, the document concluded, &quot;I now bid you farewell for a while ... I trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and yours to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father.&quot; There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast.

So began what has been called one of the most brazen confidence tricks in history — the Poyais scheme. MacGregor devised a tricameral parliament and other convoluted constitutional arrangements for Poyais, drew up commercial and banking mechanisms, and designed distinctive uniforms for each regiment of the Poyaisian Army. His imaginary country had an honours system, landed titles, a coat of arms—doubly supported by Poyers and unicorns—and the same Green Cross flag he had used in Florida. By the end of 1821 Major William John Richardson had not only accepted MacGregor&#x27;s fantasy as true but had become an active ally, providing his attractive estate at Oak Hall, Wanstead to be a British base for the supposed Poyaisian royal family. MacGregor gave Richardson the Order of the Green Cross, commissioned him into the Poyaisian &quot;Royal Regiment of Horse Guards&quot; and appointed him &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; of the Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill in the City of London—the top representative of Poyais in Britain. Richardson&#x27;s letter of credence from &quot;Gregor the First, Sovereign Prince of the State of Poyais&quot; was presented to George IV. MacGregor had Poyaisian offices set up in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow to sell impressive-looking land certificates—initially hand-written, but later printed—to the general public, and to co-ordinate prospective emigrants.

===Land of opportunity===
The consensus among MacGregor&#x27;s biographers is that Britain in the early 1820s could hardly have suited him and his Poyais scheme better. Amid a general growth in the British economy following the Battle of Waterloo and the end of the Napoleonic Wars, interest rates were dropping and the British government bond, the &quot;consol&quot;, offered rates of only 3% per annum on the London Stock Exchange. Those wanting a higher return invested in more risky foreign debt. After continental European bonds were popular in the immediate post-Waterloo years, the Latin American revolutions brought a raft of new alternatives to the London market, starting with the £2 million loan issued for Gran Colombia (incorporating both New Granada and Venezuela) in March 1822. Bonds from Colombia, Peru, Chile and others, offering interest rates as high as 6% per annum, made Latin American securities extremely popular on the London market—a trend on which a nation like the Poyais described by MacGregor would be ideally positioned to capitalise.

MacGregor mounted an aggressive sales campaign. He gave interviews in the national newspapers, engaged publicists to write advertisements and leaflets, and had Poyais-related ballads composed and sung on the streets of London, Edinburgh and Glasgow. His proclamation to the Poyers was distributed in handbill form. 

In mid-1822, there appeared in Edinburgh and London a 355-page guidebook &quot;chiefly intended for the use of settlers&quot;, &quot;Sketch of the Mosquito Shore, Including the Territory of Poyais&quot; — ostensibly the work of a &quot;Captain Thomas Strangeways&quot;, aide-de-camp to the Cazique, but actually written either by MacGregor himself or by accomplices.

The &quot;Sketch&quot; mostly comprised long, reprinted tracts from older works on the Mosquito Coast and other parts of the region. The original material ranged from misleading to outright made up. MacGregor&#x27;s publicists described the Poyaisian climate as &quot;remarkably healthy ... agree[ing] admirably with the constitution of Europeans&quot;—it was supposedly a spa destination for sick colonists from the Caribbean. The soil was so fertile that a farmer could have three maize harvests a year, or grow cash crops such as sugar or tobacco without hardship; detailed projections at the &quot;Sketch&quot;″s end forecast profits of millions of dollars. Fish and game were so plentiful that a man could hunt or fish for a single day and bring back enough to feed his family for a week. The natives were not just co-operative but intensely pro-British. The capital was St Joseph, a flourishing seaside town of wide paved boulevards, colonnaded buildings and mansions, inhabited by as many as 20,000. St Joseph had a theatre, an opera house and a domed cathedral; there was also the Bank of Poyais, the Poyaisian houses of parliament and a royal palace. Reference was made to a &quot;projected Hebrew colony&quot;. The &quot;Sketch&quot; went so far as to claim the rivers of Poyais contained &quot;globules of pure gold&quot;.
This was almost all fiction, but MacGregor&#x27;s calculation that official-looking documents and the printed word would convince many people proved correct. The meticulous detail in the leather-bound &quot;Sketch&quot;, and the cost of having it printed, did much to dispel lingering doubts. Poyaisian land certificates at two shillings and threepence per acre, roughly equivalent to a working man&#x27;s daily wage at the time, were perceived by many as an attractive investment opportunity. There was enough demand for the certificates that MacGregor was able to raise the price to two shillings and sixpence per acre in July 1822, then gradually to four shillings per acre, without diminishing sales; according to MacGregor, about 500 had bought Poyaisian land by early 1823. The buyers included many who invested their life savings. MacGregor became, to quote one 21st-century financial analyst, the &quot;founding father of securities fraud&quot;.

Alongside the land certificate sales, MacGregor spent several months organising the issue of a Poyaisian government loan on the London Stock Exchange. As a precursor to this he registered his 1820 land grant at the Court of Chancery on 14 October 1822. Sir John Perring, Shaw, Barber &amp; Co., a London bank with a fine reputation, underwrote a £200,000 loan—secured on &quot;all the revenues of the Government of Poyais&quot; including the sale of land — and offered provisional certificates or &quot;scrip&quot; for the Poyaisian bonds on 23 October. The bonds were in denominations of £100, £200 and £500, and offered at a marked-down purchase price of 80%. The certificate could be acquired for 15%, with the rest due over two installments on 17 January and 14 February 1823. The interest rate was 6% per annum. If the Poyaisian issue successfully emulated its Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean counterparts, MacGregor stood to amass a fortune.

===Eager settlers===
For settlers, MacGregor deliberately targeted his fellow Scots, assuming that they would be more likely to trust him, as a Scotsman himself. Their emigration served to reassure potential investors in the Poyaisian bonds and land certificates firstly that the country was real, and secondly that it was being developed and would provide monetary returns. In Sinclair&#x27;s assessment, this aspect of the scheme &quot;turn[ed] what would have been an inspired hoax into a cruel and deadly one&quot;. Tamar Frankel posits in her analysis that, at least to some degree, MacGregor &quot;probably believed his own story&quot; and genuinely hoped to forge these people into a Poyaisian society. MacGregor told his would-be colonists that he wished to see Poyais populated with Scots as they possessed the necessary hardiness and character to develop the new country. Alluding to the rivalry with England and the Darien episode—which, he stressed, had involved a direct ancestor of his—MacGregor suggested that in Poyais they might right this historic wrong and salvage Scottish pride. Skilled tradesmen and artisans were promised free passage to Poyais, supplies, and lucrative government contracts. Hundreds, mostly Scots, signed up to emigrate—enough to fill seven ships. They included a City of London banker named Mauger (who was to head the Bank of Poyais), doctors, civil servants, young men whose families had bought them commissions in the Poyaisian Army and Navy, and an Edinburgh cobbler who accepted the post of Official Shoemaker to the Princess of Poyais.
Leadership of the Cazique&#x27;s first emigration party was given to an ex-British Army officer, Hector Hall, who was commissioned into the Poyaisian &quot;2nd Native Regiment of Foot&quot; with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and created &quot;Baron Tinto&quot; with a supposed 12,800-acre (20-square-mile; 52-square-kilometre) estate. Hall would sail with 70 emigrants on , a vessel MacGregor had encountered in South America. MacGregor saw them off from London on 10 September 1822, entrusting to Mauger 5,000 Bank of Poyais dollar notes produced by the Bank of Scotland&#x27;s official printer. &quot;The new world of their dreams suddenly became a very real world as the men accepted the Cazique&#x27;s dollar notes,&quot; Sinclair writes. &quot;The people who had bought land, and who had planned to take their savings with them in coin, were also delighted to exchange their gold for the legal currency of Poyais.&quot; After MacGregor spoke briefly to each of the settlers to wish them luck, he and Hall exchanged salutes and the &quot;Honduras Packet&quot; set sail, flying the Green Cross flag.

A second emigrant ship—, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh — was hired by MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard to see that they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship&#x27;s captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.

While claiming royal status as Cazique, MacGregor attempted to dissociate himself from the Latin American republican movement and his former comrades there, and from late 1822 made discreet overtures towards the Spanish government regarding co-operation in Central America. The Spanish paid him little notice. The Poyaisian bonds&#x27; price remained fairly steady until they were crippled by developments elsewhere in the market during November and December 1822. Amid the general instability in South America, the Colombian government suggested that its London agent might have exceeded his authority when he arranged the £2 million loan. When this representative suddenly died, the frantic buying of South American securities was abruptly replaced by equally restless selling. The Cazique&#x27;s cash flow was all but wiped out when most of those who had bought the Poyaisian scrip did not make the payments due in January. While the price of the Colombian bonds steadied and eventually rose again, the Poyaisian securities never recovered; by late 1823 they were traded for less than 10% of their face value.

===Disappointment===
&quot;Honduras Packet&quot; reached the Black River in November 1822. Bemused to find a country rather different from the &quot;Sketch&quot;″s descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, the captain of the &quot;Honduras Packet&quot; abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.
The second set of colonists disembarked from the &quot;Kennersley Castle&quot; in late March 1823. Their optimism was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The &quot;Kennersley Castle&quot; having sailed, MacGregor&#x27;s victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.

Hall returned to Cape Gracias a Dios several times to seek help, but did not explain his constant absences to the settlers—this exacerbated the general confusion and anger, particularly when he refused to pay the wages promised to those supposedly on Poyaisian government contracts. With the coming of the rainy season insects infested the camp, diseases such as malaria and yellow fever took hold, and the emigrants sank into utter despair. James Hastie, a Scottish sawyer who had brought his wife and three children with him, later wrote: &quot;It seemed to be the will of Providence that every circumstance should combine for our destruction.&quot; Another settler, the would-be royal shoemaker, who had left a family in Edinburgh, shot himself.

The schooner &quot;Mexican Eagle&quot;, from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king&#x27;s court, discovered the settlers in early May 1823. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist and that he had never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor&#x27;s land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus&#x27;s territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.

Transported aboard the cramped &quot;Mexican Eagle&quot;—the lack of space necessitated three trips—the emigrants were in miserable shape when they reached Belize, and in most cases had to be carried from the ship. The weather in British Honduras was even worse than that at the Black River, and the colony&#x27;s authorities and doctors could do little to help the new arrivals. Disease spread rapidly among the settlers and most of them died. The colony&#x27;s superintendent, Major-General Edward Codd, opened an official investigation to &quot;lay open the true situation of the imaginary State of Poyais and ... the unfortunate emigrants&quot;, and sent word to Britain of the Poyais settlers&#x27; fate. By the time the warning reached London, MacGregor had five more emigrant ships on the way; the Royal Navy intercepted them. A third vessel—, carrying 105 more Scottish emigrants—arrived at the Black River, but on seeing the abandoned colony the master Captain John Wilson sailed on to Belize and disembarked his passengers there. The fourth and last ship to arrive was , which arrived at Belize in November 1823, but which was carrying provisions, arms, and stores and not passengers. The cargo was sold locally at auction. The surviving colonists variously settled in the United States, remained in British Honduras, or sailed for home aboard the &quot;Ocean&quot;, a British vessel that left Belize on 1 August 1823. Some died during the journey back across the Atlantic. Of the roughly 250 who had sailed on &quot;Honduras Packet&quot; and &quot;Kennersley Castle&quot;, at least 180 had perished. Fewer than 50 ever returned to Britain.
===Poyais scheme in France===
MacGregor left London shortly before the small party of Poyais survivors arrived home on 12 October 1823—he told Richardson that he was taking Josefa to winter in Italy for the sake of her health, but in fact his destination was Paris. The London press reported extensively on the Poyais scandal over the following weeks and months, stressing the colonists&#x27; travails and charging that MacGregor had orchestrated a massive fraud. Six of the survivors—including Hastie, who had lost two of his children during the ordeal—claimed that they were misquoted in these articles, and on 22 October signed an affidavit insisting that blame lay not with MacGregor but with Hall and other members of the emigrant party. &quot;[W]e believe that Sir Gregor MacGregor has been worse used by Colonel Hall and his other agents than was ever a man before&quot;, they declared, &quot;and that had they have done their duty by Sir Gregor and by us, things would have turned out very differently at Poyais&quot;. MacGregor asserted that he himself had been defrauded, alleged embezzlement by some of his agents, and claimed that covetous merchants in British Honduras were deliberately undermining the development of Poyais as it threatened their profits. Richardson attempted to console the Poyais survivors, vigorously denied the press claims that the country did not exist, and issued libel writs against some of the British newspapers on MacGregor&#x27;s behalf.
In Paris, MacGregor persuaded the Compagnie de la Nouvelle Neustrie, a firm of traders that aspired to prominence in South America, to seek investors and settlers for Poyais in France. He concurrently intensified his efforts towards King Ferdinand VII of Spain—in a November 1823 letter the Cazique proposed to make Poyais a Spanish protectorate. Four months later he offered to lead a Spanish campaign to reconquer Guatemala, using Poyais as a base. Spain took no action. MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;moment of greatest hubris&quot;, Matthew Brown suggests in his biographical portrait, came in December 1824 when, in a letter to the King of Spain, he claimed to be himself &quot;descendent of the ancient Kings of Scotland&quot;. Around this time Josefa gave birth to the third and final MacGregor child, Constantino, at their home in the Champs-Élysées. Gustavus Butler Hippisley, a friend of Major Richardson and fellow veteran of the British Legions in Latin America, accepted the Poyais fantasy as true and entered MacGregor&#x27;s employ in March 1825. Hippisley wrote back to Britain refuting &quot;the bare-faced calumnies of a hireling press&quot;; in particular he admonished a journalist who had called MacGregor a &quot;penniless adventurer&quot;. With Hippisley&#x27;s help, MacGregor negotiated with the Nouvelle Neustrie company, whose managing director was a Frenchman called Lehuby, and agreed to sell the French company up to 500,000 acres (781 square miles; 2,023 square kilometres) in Poyais for its own settlement scheme; &quot;a very clever way of distancing himself&quot;, Sinclair comments, as this time he would be able to say honestly that others were responsible and that he had merely made the land available.

Lehuby&#x27;s company readied a ship at Le Havre and began to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 obtained passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic — he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives to suggest that the relevant bonds were issued. The &quot;Sketch&quot; was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called &quot;Some Account of the Poyais Country&quot;. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had never heard of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company&#x27;s ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor&#x27;s secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby&#x27;s ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.

===1826 acquittal of fraud===
MacGregor went into hiding in the French provinces, while Lehuby fled to the southern Netherlands. Hippisley and Irving were informed on 6 September that they were being investigated for conspiracy to defraud and sell titles to land they did not own. Both insisted that they were innocent. They were taken that evening to La Force Prison. 

MacGregor was arrested after three months and brought to La Force on 7 December 1825. He speculated to his confederates that the charges against them must be the result of some abrupt change of policy by France, or of some Spanish intrigue calculated to undermine Poyaisian independence. The three men remained imprisoned without trial while the French attempted to extradite Lehuby from the Netherlands. Attempting to re-associate himself and Poyais with the republican movement in Latin America, MacGregor issued a French-language declaration from his prison cell on 10 January 1826, claiming that he was &quot;contrary to human rights, held prisoner ... for reasons of which he is not aware&quot; and &quot;suffering as one of the founders of independence in the New World&quot;. This attempt to convince the French that he might have some kind of diplomatic immunity did not work. The French government and police ignored the announcement.
The three Britons were brought to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried &quot;in absentia&quot;. The Crown prosecution&#x27;s case was seriously hampered by his absence, particularly because many key documents were with him in the Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan prospectus. MacGregor&#x27;s lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants&#x27; release — &quot;a full and perfect acquittal&quot;, Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.

The fresh trial, scheduled for 20 May, was postponed when the prosecutor announced that he was not ready. The delay gave MacGregor and Merilhou time to prepare an elaborate, largely fictional 5,000-word statement purporting to describe the Scotsman&#x27;s background, activities in the Americas, and total innocence of any endeavour to defraud. When the trial finally began on 10 July 1826, Merilhou was present not as MacGregor&#x27;s defence counsel but as a witness for the prosecution, having been called as such because of his links with the Nouvelle Neustrie company. 

Merilhou entrusted MacGregor&#x27;s defence to a colleague called Berville, who read the 5,000-word submission in full before the court. &quot;Maître Merilhou, as the author of the address the court had heard, and Maître Berville, as the actor who read the script, had done their work extremely well,&quot; Sinclair writes; Lehuby was convicted of making false representations regarding the sale of shares, and sentenced to 13 months&#x27; imprisonment, but the Cazique was found not guilty on all charges, while the imputations against Hippisley and Irving were stricken from the record.

===Return to Britain; lesser Poyais schemes===

MacGregor quickly moved his family back to London, where the furore following the Poyais survivors&#x27; return had died down. In the midst of a serious economic downturn, some investors had subscribed to the £300,000 Poyais loan issued by Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company — apparently believing the assertion of the Cazique&#x27;s publicists that the previous loans had defaulted only because of embezzlement by one of his agents. MacGregor was arrested soon after his arrival back in Britain, and held at Tothill Fields Bridewell in Westminster for about a week before being released without charge. He initiated a new, less ornate version of the Poyais scheme, describing himself simply as the &quot;Cacique of the Republic of Poyais&quot;. The new Poyaisian office at 23 Threadneedle Street made none of the claims to diplomatic status the old Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill had done.

MacGregor persuaded Thomas Jenkins &amp; Company to act as brokers for an £800,000 loan, issued on 20-year bonds at 3% interest, in mid-1827. The bonds, produced at nominal values of £250, £500 and £1,000, did not become popular. An anonymous handbill was circulated in the City of London, describing the previous Poyais loans and warning readers to &quot;Take Care of your Pockets—Another Poyais Humbug&quot;. The loan&#x27;s poor performance compelled MacGregor to pass most of the unsold certificates to a consortium of speculators for a small sum. Sinclair stresses that the Poyais bonds were perceived as &quot;humbug&quot; not because MacGregor&#x27;s hoax had been fully unravelled, but simply because the prior securities had failed to deliver profitable returns. &quot;Nobody thought to question the legitimacy of Poyais itself&quot;, he elaborates. &quot;Some investors had begun to understand that they were being fleeced, but almost none realised how comprehensively.&quot;

Other variants on the Poyais scheme were similarly unsuccessful. In 1828, MacGregor began to sell certificates entitling the holders to &quot;land in Poyais Proper&quot; at five shillings per acre. Two years later King Robert Charles Frederic, who had succeeded his brother George Frederic Augustus in 1824, issued thousands of certificates covering the same territory and offered them to lumber companies in London, directly competing with MacGregor. When the original investors demanded their long-overdue interest, MacGregor could only pay with more certificates. Other charlatans soon caught on and set up their own rival &quot;Poyaisian offices&quot; in London, offering land debentures in competition with both MacGregor and the Mosquito king. By 1834 MacGregor was back in Scotland and living in Edinburgh. He paid some unredeemed securities by issuing yet another series of Poyaisian land certificates. Two years later he published a constitution for a smaller Poyaisian republic, centred on the region surrounding the Black River, and headed by himself as president. It was clear, however, that &quot;Poyais had had its day&quot;, as Sinclair puts it. An attempt by MacGregor to sell some land certificates in 1837 marks the last record of any Poyais scheme.

==Return to Venezuela and death==

Josefa MacGregor died at Burghmuirhead, near Edinburgh, on 4 May 1838. MacGregor almost immediately left for Venezuela, where he resettled in Caracas and in October 1838 applied for citizenship and restoration to his former rank in the Venezuelan Army, with back pay and a pension. He stressed his travails on Venezuela&#x27;s behalf two decades earlier and asserted that Bolívar, who had died in 1830, had effectively deported him; he described several unsuccessful requests to return and being to] remain outside the Republic ... by causes and obstacles out of my control&quot; while losing his wife, two children and &quot;the best years of my life and all my fortune&quot;.

The Defence Minister Rafael Urdaneta, who had served alongside MacGregor during the Aux Cayes expedition of 1816, asked the Senate to look upon the Scotsman&#x27;s application favourably as he had &quot;enlisted in our ranks from the very start of the War of Independence, and ran the same risks as all the patriots of that disastrous time, meriting promotions and respect because of his excellent personal conduct&quot; — MacGregor&#x27;s contributions had been &quot;heroic with immense results&quot;. President José Antonio Páez, another former revolutionary comrade, approved the application in March 1839.

MacGregor was duly confirmed as a Venezuelan citizen and divisional general in the Venezuelan Army, with a pension of one-third of his salary. He settled in the capital and became a respected member of the local community. After his death at home in Caracas on 4 December 1845, he was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral, with President Carlos Soublette, Cabinet ministers and the military chiefs of Venezuela marching behind his coffin. Obituaries in the Caracas press extolled General MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;heroic and triumphant retreat&quot; to Barcelona in 1816 and described him as &quot;a valiant champion of independence&quot;. &quot;There was not a word about Amelia Island, Porto Bello or Rio de la Hacha, and there was no reference to the Cazique of Poyais&quot;, Sinclair concludes. The part of today&#x27;s Honduras that was supposedly called Poyais remains undeveloped in the 21st century. Back in Scotland, at the MacGregor graveyard near Loch Katrine, the clan memorial stones make no mention of Gregor MacGregor or the country he invented.

<text>Veronica Guerin Turley (5 July 1959 – 26 June 1996) was an Irish investigative journalist focusing on organised crime in Ireland, who was murdered in a contract killing believed to have been ordered by a South Dublin-based drug cartel. Born in Dublin, she was an athlete in school and later played on the Irish national teams for both Association football and basketball. After studying accountancy she ran a public-relations firm for seven years, before working for Fianna Fáil and as an election agent for Seán Haughey. She became a reporter in 1990, writing for the &quot;Sunday Business Post&quot; and &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;. In 1994 she began writing articles about the Irish criminal underworld for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;. In 1996, after pressing charges for assault against major organised crime figure John Gilligan, Guerin was ambushed and fatally shot in her vehicle while waiting at a traffic light. The shooting caused national outrage in Ireland. Investigation into her death led to a number of arrests and convictions.

==Early and personal life==
The daughter of Christopher and Bernadette, Guerin was nicknamed &quot;Ronnie&quot;. She and her four siblings were born and brought up in Artane, Dublin, and attended St. Mary&#x27;s secondary school in Killester where she excelled in athletics. Besides basketball and camogie, aged 15 she played in the All-Ireland football finals with a slipped disc. She played for both the Ireland women&#x27;s national basketball team and Republic of Ireland women&#x27;s national football team, representing the latter in a match against England at Dalymount Park in May 1981.

Guerin studied accountancy at Trinity College Dublin. She married Graham Turley in 1985, and the couple had a son, Cathal (born 1989). She was a supporter of Manchester United football team; her prized possession was a photo of her and Eric Cantona taken on a visit to Old Trafford.

==PR career: 1983–1990==
After she graduated, her father employed her at his company, but, following his death three years later, she changed professions and started a public relations firm in 1983, which she ran for seven years.

In 1983–84, she served as secretary to the Fianna Fáil group at the New Ireland Forum. She served as Charles Haughey&#x27;s personal assistant, and became a family friend, taking holidays with his children. In 1987 she served as election agent and party treasurer in Dublin North for Seán Haughey.

==Journalism career: 1990–1996==
In 1990, she changed careers again, switching to journalism as a reporter with the &quot;Sunday Business Post&quot; and &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, working under editor Damien Kiberd. Craving first-hand information, she pursued a story directly to the source with little regard for her personal safety, to engage those she deemed central to a story. This allowed her to build close relationships with both the legitimate authorities, such as the Garda Síochána (police), and the criminals, with both sides respecting her diligence by providing highly detailed information. She also reported on Irish Republican Army activities in Ireland.

From 1994 onwards, she began to write about criminals for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;. Using her accountancy knowledge to trace the proceeds of illegal activity, she used street names or pseudonyms for underworld figures to avoid Irish libel laws.

When she began to cover drug dealers and gained information from convicted drugs criminal John Traynor, she received numerous death threats. The first violence against her occurred in October 1994, when two shots were fired into her home after her story on murdered crime kingpin Martin Cahill was published. Guerin dismissed the &quot;warning&quot;. The day after writing an article on Gerry &quot;The Monk&quot; Hutch, on 30 January 1995, she answered her doorbell to a man pointing a revolver at her head, but the gunman missed and shot her in the leg. Regardless, she vowed to continue her investigations. Independent Newspapers installed a security system to protect her, and the Gardaí gave her a 24-hour escort; however, she did not approve of this, saying that it hampered her work.

On 13 September 1995, convicted criminal John Gilligan, Traynor&#x27;s boss, attacked her when she confronted him about his lavish lifestyle with no source of income. He later called her at home and threatened to kidnap and rape her son, and kill her if she wrote anything about him.

Guerin received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists in December 1995.

==Assassination and funeral==

On the evening of 25 June 1996, Gilligan drug gang members Charles Bowden, Brian Meehan, Kieran &#x27;Muscles&#x27; Concannon, Peter Mitchell and Paul Ward met at their distribution premises on the Greenmount Industrial Estate. Bowden, the gang&#x27;s distributor and ammunition quartermaster, supplied the three with a Colt Python revolver loaded with .357 Magnum semiwadcutter bullets. On 26 June 1996, while driving her red Opel Calibra, Guerin stopped at a red traffic light on the Naas Dual Carriageway near Newlands Cross, on the outskirts of Dublin, unaware she was being followed. She was then shot six times, fatally, by one of two men sitting on a motorcycle.

About an hour after Guerin was murdered, a meeting took place in Moore Street, Dublin, between Bowden, Meehan, and Mitchell. Bowden later denied under oath in court that the purpose of the meeting was the disposal of the weapon, but that it was an excuse to appear in a public setting to place them away from the incident.
At the time of her murder, Traynor was seeking a High Court order against Guerin to prevent her from publishing a book about his involvement in organised crime. Guerin was killed two days before she was due to speak at a Freedom Forum conference in London. The topic of her segment was &quot;Dying to Tell the Story: Journalists at Risk&quot;.

Her funeral service, on 29 June 1996 at a church in Dublin Airport, was attended by Ireland&#x27;s Taoiseach John Bruton, and the head of the armed forces. It was covered live by Raidió Teilifís Éireann. On 4 July, labour unions across Ireland called for a moment of silence in her memory, which was duly observed by people around the country. Guerin is buried in Dardistown Cemetery, County Dublin.

==Aftermath==

Guerin&#x27;s murder caused outrage, and Taoiseach John Bruton called it &quot;an attack on democracy&quot;. The Oireachtas, the Irish parliament, realised the potential of using tax enforcement laws as a means of deterring and punishing criminals. Within a week of her murder, it enacted the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, so that assets purchased with money obtained through crime could be seized by the government. This led to the formation of the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB).

After the murder of Guerin, Bowden was arrested as were the other members of Gilligan&#x27;s gang who were still in Ireland. In an agreement with the Attorney General of Ireland, Bowden agreed to turn state&#x27;s witness, and become the first person to enter the Republic&#x27;s Witness Security Programme. Granted immunity from prosecution for the murder of Guerin, he was the only witness to give evidence against all four drug gang members at their trials in the Special Criminal Court: Patrick Holland, Paul &quot;Hippo&quot; Ward, Brian Meehan and John Gilligan. The investigation into Guerin&#x27;s death resulted in over 150 other arrests and convictions, as well as seizures of drugs and arms. Drug crime in Ireland dropped 15 percent in the following 12 months. Four months after Guerin&#x27;s murder, in October 1996, there was a sharp decline in the sex ratio at birth in Ireland, an indicator of societal stress levels, which fell to 0.5 from an anticipated value of more than 0.51.

In 1997, while acting as a Garda witness, Bowden named Patrick &quot;Dutchy&quot; Holland in court as the man he supplied the gun to, and hence suspected of shooting Guerin. Holland was never convicted of the murder, and he denied the accusation until his death in June 2009 while in prison in the UK.

In November 1998, after evidence from Bowden and others, Paul &quot;Hippo&quot; Ward was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison as an accomplice, because he had disposed of the murder weapon and the motorbike. This conviction was later overturned on appeal.

Brian Meehan fled to Amsterdam with Traynor (who later escaped to Portugal). After the court dismissed additional evidence from Bowden, Meehan was convicted on the testimony of gang member turned state&#x27;s witness Russell Warren, who had followed Guerin&#x27;s movements in the hours before the murder, and then called Meehan on a mobile phone with the details. Meehan was convicted of murdering Guerin, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He is the only individual serving a life sentence for his role in the murder.

John Gilligan left Ireland the day before Guerin was murdered, on a flight to Amsterdam. He was arrested 12 months later in the United Kingdom trying to board a flight for Amsterdam after a routine search of his baggage revealed $500,000 in cash. Claiming it was the proceeds of gambling, he was charged with money laundering. After a three-year legal battle, he was extradited to Ireland on 3 February 2000. Tried and acquitted of Guerin&#x27;s murder, he was later convicted of importing 20 tonnes of cannabis and sentenced to 28 years in prison, reduced to 20 years on appeal.

Pursued by CAB, in January 2008, Gilligan made a court appearance in an attempt to stop the Irish State from selling off his assets. He accused Traynor of having ordered Guerin&#x27;s murder without his permission. Despite the presiding judge&#x27;s attempt to silence Gilligan, he continued to blame a botched Gardaí investigation and planted evidence as the reason for his current imprisonment. Traynor had fled to Portugal after Guerin&#x27;s murder, and having been on the run from British authorities since 1992, resided mainly in Spain and the Netherlands from 1996 onwards. After a failed extradition from the Netherlands in 1997, which brought Meehan back to Ireland, in 2010 Traynor was arrested after a joint UK SOCA/Regiokorpsen operation in Amsterdam.
Traynor, as of 2013, was living in Kent, England after serving time in an English prison. Traynor died in 2021 of cancer.

Turley remarried in 2011. Guerin and Turley&#x27;s son, Cathal Turley, relocated to Dubai and, as of 2021, manages an Irish pub at the Dubai World Trade Centre.

==Memorials and legacy==

A memorial statue to Guerin is located in Dubh Linn Gardens, in the grounds of Dublin Castle.

On 2 May 1997, at a ceremony in Arlington, Virginia, her name and those of 38 other international journalists who died in the line of duty in 1996 were added to the Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial. Her husband addressed the audience: &quot;Veronica stood for freedom to write. She stood as light, and wrote of life in Ireland today, and told the truth. Veronica was not a judge, nor was she a juror, but she paid the ultimate price with the sacrifice of her life.&quot;

In 2000, Guerin was named as one of the International Press Institute&#x27;s 50 World Press Freedom Heroes of the past 50 years.

In 2007, the &quot;Veronica Guerin Memorial Scholarship&quot; was set up at Dublin City University, offering a bursary intended to meet the cost of fees and part of the general expenses of an MA in Journalism student who wishes to specialise in investigative journalism.

Two films have been based on her story: &quot;When the Sky Falls&quot; (2000), starring Joan Allen as Sinead Hamilton and &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; (2003), starring Cate Blanchett. A biography titled &quot;Veronica Guerin: The Life and Death of a Crime Reporter&quot; by Emily O&#x27;Reilly, published in 1998, questions the ethics of Guerin&#x27;s methods of gathering information, and those of the underlying media establishment. Guerin&#x27;s murder was a main inspiration and plot point of progressive metal band Savatage&#x27;s 1997 concept album &quot;The Wake of Magellan&quot;.

<doc id="703944" wikidata="Q4497256" url="?curid=703944" title="Henrys Fork (Snake River tributary)">
<text>Henrys Fork is a tributary river of the Snake River, approximately long, in southeastern Idaho in the United States. It is also referred to as the North Fork of the Snake River. Its drainage basin is , including its main tributary, the Teton River. Its mean annual discharge, as measured at river mile 9.2 (Henrys Fork near Rexburg) by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), is , with a maximum daily recorded flow of , and a minimum of . It is normally transcribed without an apostrophe.

The river is named for Andrew Henry, who first entered the Snake River plateau in 1810. Employed by the Missouri Fur Company, he built Fort Henry on the upper Snake River, near modern St. Anthony, but abandoned this first American fur post west of the continental divide the following spring.

==Sources==
The river&#x27;s source is at Big Springs and the Henrys Lake outlet (10 miles northwest of Big Springs). To the east is Targhee Pass, with Raynolds Pass to the northwest and Red Rock Pass to the southwest. The headwaters of the Henrys Fork are within of the headwaters of the Missouri River (on the Red Rock River and Madison River), located across the continental divide in Montana. Henry&#x27;s Fork drains the northeastern corner of the Snake River Plain, along the continental divide.

==River ecology==
The Henrys Lake outlet is subject to substantial draw-downs from irrigation diversions during the summer. Late in the season, as the draw-downs decrease with the cooler weather, more water is released into the stream, allowing fish to move up from the lower section of the river. The Nature Conservancy sponsors a learning station near the outlet stream.

South of the lake at Big Springs, nearly of constant water flow into the river each day. The river flows south through a high plateau in northern Fremont County, through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, and passes through Island Park Reservoir. It emerges from the reservoir and flows through a canyon that opens up into a broad, flat meadow in the Island Park Caldera in central Fremont County. The river flows slowly past the town of Island Park, through the Harriman State Park, otherwise known as the &quot;Railroad Ranch&quot;, and then descends swiftly as it approaches the wall of the caldera, flowing over both Upper Mesa and Lower Mesa Falls, and emerges from the mountains onto the Snake River Plain near Ashton. It flows southwest across the plain, past St. Anthony, and splits into multiple channels into a broad inland delta north of Rexburg. It receives the Teton River from the east approximately west of Rexburg. It joins the Snake from the northeast approximately southwest of Rexburg, just below .

Island Park Reservoir, a component of the Minidoka Project, is used for irrigation in the Snake River Plain. Its drainage provides one of the most important rainbow trout fisheries in Idaho regarding habitat, fish populations, and use by anglers. The section of the river between Henry&#x27;s Lake and Big Springs is a major spawning area for trout and is closed to fishing.

Henrys Fork has long been noted for its superb fishing, especially its dry fly fishing. Bing Lempke, a pipefitter from nearby Idaho Falls, was considered the local dean of the fishery until he died in 1990.

<text>Gylmar dos Santos Neves (; 22 August 1930 – 25 August 2013), known simply as Gilmar, was a Brazilian footballer who played goalkeeper for Corinthians and Santos and was a member of the Brazil national team in three World Cups. He was elected the best Brazilian goalkeeper of the 20th century and one of the best in the world by the IFFHS. He is remembered for his sober style on the pitch and his peaceful personality.

Alex Bellos says in his book &quot;Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life&quot; that Gilmar is named after his parents, Gilberto and Maria. Gilmar was the starting goalkeeper for Pelé&#x27;s Santos and Brazilian national teams of the 1960s. In 1998, he was awarded the FIFA Order of Merit.

== Club career ==
Gilmar was born in Santos, São Paulo, and started his career playing for hometown side Jabaquara. In 1951 he joined Corinthians, winning three Campeonato Paulista titles with the club in 1951, 1952 and 1954.

In 1961, Gilmar signed for Santos, being a part of the team who was known as &quot;Os Santásticos&quot;. An immediate starter, he won five Campeonato Paulista (1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968), five Taça Brasil (1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965), two Copa Libertadores (1962 and 1963) and two Intercontinental Cups (1962 against Eusébio&#x27;s Benfica and 1963 against Milan).

== International career ==

Gilmar played 94 times with the Brazil national team. He was selected to the national squad for three straight World Cups, between 1958 and 1966. He was part of the starting team in the first two World Cups Brazil won, in 1958 and 1962, and is the only goalkeeper to win two consecutive World Cups in the starting position.

==Style of play==
Regarded by pundits as one of the greatest Brazilian goalkeepers of all time, Gilmar was an agile shot-stopper, who possessed excellent reflexes, and who was also known for his composure under pressure, as well as his ability to inspire a sense of calm and confidence in his defenders.

==Death==
Gilmar died of a stroke on 25 August 2013, three days after his 83rd birthday.

<text>Gubin () is a town in Krosno Odrzańskie County, Lubusz Voivodeship, in western Poland. It is the administrative seat of the rural Gmina Gubin, though not part of it.

Gubin is on the right bank of the Lusatian Neisse river, at the border with Germany. The rail and road border crossings are connected with the German town of Guben, of which Gubin was the central and eastern part until the division of the city by the Oder–Neisse line in 1945.

==Geography==
Gubin is situated in the Polish part of the historic Lower Lusatia region, at the confluence of the Neisse and Lubsza rivers. It is located on the national road 32 operating as an orbital road for Gubin. It starts at the border crossing with Guben, runs to Krosno Odrzańskie and the regional capital Zielona Góra, and further leads to the national road 5 that connects Wrocław and Poznań. Gubin also has a railway border crossing on the line from Guben to Zbąszyń.

The municipal area of Gubin comprises 20.68 km2 of which 61% is used for agricultural purposes and 5% is used for forest uses. The city takes up 1.5% of the area of the Krosno Odrzańskie County.

==History==

The trade settlement existed since the 11th century. In the early 11th century it became part of the early Polish state under Bolesław I the Brave, and later it fell to the March of Lusatia. Gubin began to develop around 1200 as a trade and marketplace on the roads between Leipzig and Poznań and between Görlitz and Frankfurt (Oder). From the 13th century it was a center of clothmaking and wine trade. In the early 13th century it was part of the Duchy of Silesia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, and it was mentioned under the name &quot;Gubin&quot; in a document of Duke Henry the Bearded in 1211. Lost by Poland in 1224, afterwards it often changed affiliation. Its in the later centuries would be Germanized to &quot;Guben&quot;. Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, granted this settlement Magdeburg rights on June 1, 1235, and declared it an oppidum (town). In the 14th century the town hall was built. In 1319 the town was unsuccessfully besieged by King John of Bohemia, and afterwards it fell to the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg, before it was captured by House of Wittelsbach in 1324. It was regained by the Silesian Piasts in 1362, and in 1364 and 1367 Duke Bolko II the Small confirmed old privileges of Gubin. From 1368 the town was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, itself an Electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, in 1469 it passed under Hungarian suzerainty, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, and from 1526 under the House of Habsburg. The town was visited by King of Poland Sigismund I the Old.

In 1635, Elector John George I of Saxony received Lower Lusatia and Guben in the Peace of Prague. From 1697 in the Polish-Saxon personal union, it was visited by King Augustus II the Strong of Poland and Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. In 1751, Augustus III of Poland and Saxony established a mint in present-day Gubin, which produced Polish copper coins. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Kingdom of Saxony ceded the town to the Kingdom of Prussia. Guben became the capital of a district within the Province of Brandenburg. In 1871, Guben became part of the German Empire.
During World War II, in 1944–1945, the Germans operated a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, in which around 1,000 women, most of whom were Jewish, were imprisoned and used as forced labour. In February 1945 the Germans evacuated the prisoners, who were taken to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
The old town of Gubin was seriously damaged in the wake of the Soviet Vistula–Oder Offensive during the last stage of the war, with the historic town hall and church being burnt out. When after the war the Oder–Neisse line was chosen as the new East German–Polish border at the Potsdam Conference, Guben was split. The eastern portion of the devastated town, including the historic centre, became Polish under the restored name Gubin, while the western portion as Guben became part of East Germany. The pre-war German population was expropriated and expelled to Guben on June 20, 1945. Gubin was repopulated with Polish settlers, partly from former eastern Poland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union.

While the town hall dating from the 14th century has since been restored, the Late Gothic parish church is today a stabilised ruin. Recently, a historical society has set up plans for a reconstruction.

Gubin belonged to Zielona Góra Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. A large garrison of the Polish Army was based in Gubin in 1951–2002, including the 5th Infantry Division, which evolved into the 5th &quot;Saxony&quot; Tank Division in 1956. The garrison was closed in 2002 following restructuring.

Since the Schengen Agreement entered into force on 21 December 2007, border controls between Gubin and Guben have been abolished.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of both the city of Gubin and Guben are almost identical, which further emphasizes their shared history as one township. Whereas the original arms of Guben features the Saxon coat of arms, the Bohemian Lion and the Prussian Eagle, Gubin dropped the Saxon and Prussian shields after it became part of Poland, and replaced the Bohemian double-tailed Lion in the centre with the Polish Eagle.

In Gubin, all of the schools to date are run by the local government.

<text>Some Kind of Wonderful is a 1987 American teen romantic drama film directed by Howard Deutch and starring Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Lea Thompson. It is one of several successful teen dramas written by John Hughes in the 1980s. Blue-collar teen Keith goes out with the popular Amanda, a girl he has always dreamed of dating. Her ex-boyfriend plots revenge on him, while Keith&#x27;s tomboy best friend Watts realizes she has feelings for Keith. The film had its premiere in Hollywood on February 23, 1987, and widely released theatrically in the United States on February 27.

==Plot==
The film is set against the strict social hierarchy of an American public high school in the San Fernando Valley. Blue-collar mechanic and aspiring artist Keith Nelson is best friends with tomboy drummer Watts. Keith&#x27;s father, Cliff, is obsessed with sending him to college for business, as he would be the first in their family to go.

Keith is enamored with Amanda Jones, one of the most popular girls in school, and he spends much of his time drawing her. She is dating Hardy Jenns, a spoiled and selfish boy from a wealthy neighborhood. However, Amanda herself is not wealthy: she lives in the same working-class district as Watts and Keith, and she borrows her fashionable clothes from her friends. Hardy treats Amanda as his &quot;property&quot; while also fooling around with another girl.

Watts is dismissive of Keith&#x27;s crush, saying that he and Amanda are too different. Hearing that Amanda will be in detention for the foreseeable future, Keith gets himself in trouble to spend time with her. However, she talks her way out of it, and he is stuck with the school criminals, eventually making friends with troublemaker Duncan (a cool Punk Rock youth).

When Amanda breaks up with Hardy, Keith asks her out. Mainly to spite Hardy, Amanda accepts. Meanwhile, seeing them together makes Watts realize that she loves Keith as more than just a friend. She pretends to like another boy to try and make Keith jealous, and she continues to discourage him from being with Amanda, to no avail. Keith&#x27;s popularity around school begins to increase once word spreads of his upcoming date with Amanda, whereas Amanda&#x27;s popularity quickly declines.

Hardy plots trouble for Keith by inviting him and Amanda to a party after their date, where he plans to have him beaten up. Through his sister Laura, Keith finds out about the scheme and believes Amanda is a part of it. He decides to go to the party anyway and face Hardy.

Amanda&#x27;s wealthy and popular “friends” start to shun her for leaving Hardy, and Keith attempts to plan the perfect date to prove he is worthy of Amanda. With Watts in tow, he uses his college money to buy a pair of diamond earrings, rent an expensive car, and take Amanda to a posh restaurant. Watts tells him that she will appreciate a good kisser, so she kisses Keith under the guise of teaching him how to do it. Still, Keith is oblivious to her attraction to him. When Cliff discovers the college fund has been emptied, he is livid, but Keith ultimately convinces his father to respect his right to make his own decisions.

On the night of the date, Keith picks up Amanda, with Watts serving as their chauffeur. They go to an expensive restaurant for dinner, however they initially argue. Then, Keith brings Amanda to an art museum and shows her a painting he did of her. He gives her the earrings, and they kiss while Watts watches them from a distance.

Finally, they go to Hardy&#x27;s party. Keith is about to get beaten by Hardy&#x27;s friends when Duncan and his school buddies arrive to help him. Hardy tries to talk his way out of the predicament, exposing himself as a coward in front of the party guests. Amused, Keith tells him he is &quot;over,&quot; after which Amanda slaps Hardy twice.

After they leave the party, Watts apologizes to Amanda. Watts then leaves them and starts to walk home in tears. Amanda suddenly realizes that Keith and Watts have feelings for each other. She gives the earrings back to Keith and urges him to go after Watts.

Keith, realizing that he is in love with his best friend, bids Amanda goodbye. He catches up to Watts, and they kiss. He then gives the earrings to her. She is delighted and admits that she wanted them. When she puts them on and asks Keith how they look, he replies, &quot;You look good wearing my future.&quot;

Deutch and Hughes were not happy with the ending of their previous collaboration &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986); in the script and the original cut of the film Andy (Molly Ringwald) wound up with her best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer). Test audiences disliked that ending, however, so a new ending was shot where Andy wound up with Blane (Andrew McCarthy).

With &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, Hughes decided to re-tell the story, but with the genders of the main characters switched. Hughes named the three main protagonists—Keith, Watts, and Amanda Jones—as an inside-joke tribute to the Rolling Stones (Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and the Stones&#x27; song &quot;Miss Amanda Jones&quot;, respectively). Hughes wanted Ringwald to play the female lead role of Watts, but she declined in order to pursue more adult roles; she also thought the character of Amanda seemed too similar to the character she played in &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. Hughes took this refusal personally, and it led to the end of Hughes&#x27;s and Ringwald&#x27;s working relationship.

Martha Coolidge was signed to direct &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;. Mary Stuart Masterson was cast as Watts. In addition to Masterson, Coolidge cast Eric Stoltz as Keith. Coolidge&#x27;s vision of the film, which was darker than the eventual product, attracted Stoltz to the role. Unhappy with Coolidge, Hughes fired her and hired Deutch to direct. Original cast members Kim Delaney (Amanda Jones) and Kyle MacLachlan (Hardy Jenns) were fired shortly after. Deutch offered Lea Thompson the role of Amanda, but she initially turned him down. However, after the Thompson-starring &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; flopped at the box office, she accepted a second offer to take the role. Deutch and Thompson started dating after filming was completed, and they got married in 1989.

This film would have marked a third collaboration of both Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson, the first being &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984), and the second being &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), where both Stoltz and Thompson had been cast, but just five weeks into filming &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, Stoltz was let go from the production and replaced with Michael J. Fox, while Thompson stayed on. This film was shot in Los Angeles in the summer of 1986. Locations include San Pedro High School, Hancock Park, and the Hollywood Bowl.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 45 reviews, with the site&#x27;s consensus: &quot;&quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; is above-average &#x27;80s teen fare for people who need as much John Hughes in their lives as possible.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 55 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on a scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film, giving it 3 stars out of four and wrote how he admired its clever re-examination of a common film trope: the film &quot;is not about whether the hero will get the girl. It is about whether the hero should get the girl, and when was the last time you saw a movie that even knew that could be the question?&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; is the &quot;much-improved, recycled version of the &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; story&quot;. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; criticized the film for being unrealistic. Masterson&#x27;s look and performance were singled out for praise by several critics. The film grossed $18.5 million at the box office.

<doc id="703965" wikidata="Q460926" url="?curid=703965" title="John Williams (Tennessee politician)">
<text>John Williams (January 29, 1778 – August 10, 1837) was an American lawyer, soldier, and statesman, operating primarily out of Knoxville, Tennessee, in the first part of the 19th century. He represented Tennessee in the United States Senate from 1815 to 1823, when he lost reelection to Andrew Jackson. Williams also served as colonel of the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment during the Creek Wars, and played a key role in Jackson&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814.

Williams later distanced himself from Jackson, and aligned himself with John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Adams appointed him chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Federal Republic of Central America in 1825.

==Early life==
Williams was born in what is now Forsyth County, North Carolina (then part of Surry County), the third of twelve children of Joseph and Rebekah Lanier Williams. His father was of Welsh descent, and his mother was descended from French Huguenots. Two of Williams&#x27; brothers, Lewis Williams and Robert Williams, served as U.S. congressmen in the 19th century. Another brother, Thomas Lanier Williams, was a prominent Tennessee judge. Williams was also the cousin of Congressman Marmaduke Williams .

Williams studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina, in the late 1790s, and served as a captain in the 6th U.S. Infantry, from 1799 to 1800. Shortly afterward, he relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he was admitted to the bar in 1803. Around 1805, he married Melinda White, daughter of Knoxville&#x27;s founder, James White.

In 1807, Williams was appointed Tennessee&#x27;s attorney general, and served in this capacity until the following year. In 1811, he led a mass meeting of Knox County citizens that condemned Archibald Roane for resigning from the state legislature to run for circuit court judge. In a letter published in a local newspaper, Williams blasted Roane as too selfish and too much of a drunkard to be a faithful judge.

==Military activities (1812–1815)==

===Raiding Seminole Villages===
In December 1812, John Williams assembled 240 Tennessee mounted volunteers with 220 Georgia troops led by Rifleman Colonel Thomas Adams Smith to conduct a raid on the Seminoles who were reported to be allegedly planning attacks on Americans as allies of the British and Spanish. The combined American militia force marched on Payne&#x27;s Town on February 8, 1813. The Americans engaged the Seminole warriors for several hours before driving them off. The Americans set their base of operations. The Americans conducted raids on nearby villages destroying homes and crops. The Americans killed 20 Seminole warriors, burned 386 houses, destroyed 2,000 bushels of corn, and destroyed 2,000 deerskins. The Americans took 300 horses, 400 head of cattle, and 9 Seminoles/Africans as prisoners. John Williams and Thomas Adams Smith with their combined raiding force then withdrew back to friendly lines on February 24, 1813. &quot;

===Recruiting Troops for the Creek War===
In June 1813, Williams was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a colonel, and ordered to recruit and organize the 39th U.S. Infantry for the purpose of engaging the hostile Red Stick Creeks. Within a few weeks, Williams had managed to recruit and partially equip 600 troops. In early 1814, Williams and the 39th were placed under the command of Andrew Jackson, who was preparing an expedition against the Red Sticks in Alabama.

===Battle of Horseshoe Bend===
On March 27, Jackson attacked the Red Stick camp on the Tallapoosa River, initiating the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. At the height of this battle, Williams and the 39th, which comprised Jackson&#x27;s main line, charged and captured the log barricade with which the Creeks had fortified the riverbend, forcing the Creeks to flee. In his report on the battle, Jackson commended the actions of Williams and several other officers of the 39th. Soldiers who fought under Williams at this battle included future Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton and future Tennessee and Texas governor, Sam Houston.

===Handling Weapons Logistics in Washington, D.C.===
Following the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Williams went to Washington, D.C., to raise money for the 39th, and gradually acquired a sizable cache of weapons. Throughout 1814, Williams and Jackson bickered over these weapons, with Jackson demanding that Williams give them to a militia company in Tennessee, and Williams arguing that federal arms could not be distributed to militia companies. Jackson questioned Williams&#x27; loyalty, and Williams questioned Jackson&#x27;s authority.

==United States Senate==

In 1815, Williams was chosen to fill the Senate seat left vacant by the resignation of Jesse Wharton (who had been appointed to the seat a few months earlier following the resignation of George W. Campbell). In 1817, Williams was reelected to a full six-year term. Williams voted in favor of the Second Bank of the United States in 1816, opposed the Bonus Bill of 1817, and voted for the Missouri Compromise of 1820. He was also chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, and oversaw a reduction of the armed forces.

In 1819, following Jackson&#x27;s invasion of Florida (then part of Spain), another dispute erupted between Williams and Jackson. Jackson accused Williams of spreading a rumor that Jackson had launched the invasion to protect personal land investments in the Pensacola area, and argued that Williams was assailing his character in private conversations in Washington. In 1821, Williams was one of just four senators to vote against the Adams–Onís Treaty, in which Spain ceded Florida to the United States.

In 1823, Williams made it clear that he was going to support William H. Crawford (another enemy of Jackson) for the presidency, leading Jackson&#x27;s allies in Tennessee to seek Williams&#x27; removal from the Senate. When they were unable to find a candidate with enough support to defeat Williams, Jackson agreed to become a candidate for Williams&#x27; seat. Though Williams had the support of the influential &quot;Knoxville Register&quot; and rising politician Davy Crockett, he lost to Jackson by a margin of 35 votes to 25 at a contentious meeting of the state legislature on October 1, 1823.

==Later life==

After losing his U.S. Senate seat, Williams ran for Knox County&#x27;s state senate seat in 1825, but lost to James Anderson by a vote of 982 to 931. President John Quincy Adams pondered appointing Williams Secretary of War, but was dissuaded by Henry Clay, who thought the appointment should go to someone from New York. Adams eventually appointed Williams chargé d&#x27;affaires to the Central American Federation, and Williams thus spent most of 1826 at this post in Guatemala.

In 1827, Williams again ran for Knox County&#x27;s state senate seat. In spite of staunch opposition from Jackson&#x27;s allies (including Williams&#x27; brother-in-law, Hugh Lawson White, who referred to Williams as a &quot;mean politician who can get no man to lye upon him&quot;), Williams won the election, 1,585 to 1,216. During his term, he introduced a bill calling for the construction of a turnpike connecting Anderson County and Kentucky, a bill providing relief for female debtors, and legislation seeking greater oversight of the Bank of Tennessee. He retired from the state senate in 1829.

Williams spent his later years practicing law and advocating railroad construction. He rejected several invitations to run for Congress, stating he had no desire to go to Washington and serve at the &quot;bow of the emperor,&quot; in reference to then-President Jackson. Williams died on August 10, 1837, and was interred in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Knoxville.

==Family and legacy==

In 1816, Williams made plans to develop a subdivision, &quot;Williamsburg,&quot; on what was then the outskirts of Knoxville (now part of the Downtown area). This subdivision was bounded by what is now Henley Street (which at the time was the city&#x27;s western boundary), Main Street, the riverfront, and Second Creek. The area is now occupied by Maplehurst Park and the Church Street Methodist Church.

In 1826, while Williams was in Guatemala, his wife oversaw the construction of a new family home in East Knoxville, now known as the Colonel John Williams House. The house is still standing, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Williams&#x27; son, Joseph Lanier Williams, served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1837 to 1843). Another son, John Williams II, was a prominent pro-Union leader during the Civil War, and served as vice president of the East Tennessee Convention, which sought to create a separate, Union-aligned state in East Tennessee. John Williams was the great-grandfather of Admiral Richmond P. Hobson, and the great-great-grandfather of noted playwright, Tennessee Williams.

Fort Williams, a supply depot built prior to the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, was named for Williams.
