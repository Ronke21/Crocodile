<text>Universal Orlando Resort, often shortened to Universal Orlando, is a theme park and entertainment resort complex located in Orlando, Florida. It is the flagship theme park destination of Universal Destinations and Experiences. Following the opening of Universal Studios Florida in 1990, MCA moved forward with plans to expand from a single park into a large resort hoping to compete with Walt Disney World Resort. In 1999, a second theme park, Universal Islands of Adventure, opened in addition to Universal CityWalk, a shopping promenade and nightlife district that incorporates a variety of themed restaurants and retail outlets. The third and first ever water theme park, Universal Volcano Bay, was added in 2017. A fourth theme park, Universal Epic Universe, is scheduled to open in 2025.

The amusement destination was originally dubbed Universal Studios Escape, but the name was short-lived and changed to Universal Orlando Resort in July 2000 due to guest confusion. Notable additions over the years include Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s KidZone at Universal Studios, multiple hotels and The Rising Star karaoke bar within CityWalk, as well as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed area, which spans both theme parks and significantly boosted attendance at the entire resort. It also features well-known annual events, such as &quot;Universal&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights&quot;, along with a variety of live entertainment and shows.

Universal Orlando ranks as one of the most visited resorts in the world with an annual attendance of 21 million as of 2017. Guests staying at certain hotels receive special perks such as early admission into The Wizarding World of Harry Potter and Universal&#x27;s Volcano Bay, or in some cases, benefits such as free Universal Express Pass, which gives access to shorter lines at major attractions. The resort also features an organized transportation system, including water taxis, pathways, buses, and moving walkways that connect many of the area&#x27;s hotels and theme parks. Universal Orlando exceeded three of the four Walt Disney World Resort theme parks in estimated 2021 attendance.

==History==

After Universal Studios Florida opened on June 7, 1990, Universal Entertainment formed a joint venture with The Blackstone Group and began planning a future expansion that would transform the single park into a multi-day destination resort. In late 1995, construction began on a new park, Universal Islands of Adventure. During this time, several new attractions were being built and opened at Universal Studios Florida, including Woody Woodpecker&#x27;s KidZone, Men in Black: Alien Attack, and Animal Actors On Location! (formerly Animal Planet Live).

Universal&#x27;s Islands of Adventure opened to the general public on May 28, 1999, featuring six themed islands, including the Port of Entry, Seuss Landing, The Lost Continent, Jurassic Park, Toon Lagoon, and Marvel Super Hero Island. The park opened to mediocre attendance, and as a result, several attractions were closed soon after, including Island Skipper Tours.

Along with the new theme park, the resort also opened a Florida version of Universal CityWalk from Universal Studios Hollywood. While it is the same concept, CityWalk Orlando was given different venues and design. Universal also opened the resort&#x27;s first onsite hotel in September 1999. Loews Portofino Bay Hotel (originally Portofino Bay Hotel, a Loews Hotel) was operated and partially owned by Loews Hotels but was also partially owned by Universal and The Blackstone Group. The two theme parks, CityWalk, and the hotel were branded as Universal Studios Escape, however the name was quickly changed to Universal Orlando Resort in July 2000 due to guests being confused as to what the resort encompassed.

In December 2000, Hard Rock Hotel opened as Universal Orlando&#x27;s second onsite hotel. Despite its name, the hotel is owned by Loews Hotels, like Loews Portofino Bay Hotel and is not affiliated with Hard Rock International. In 2001, Loews Royal Pacific Resort opened. In the midst of all these openings, two parking garages were constructed and the popular water park Wet &#x27;n Wild Orlando was acquired.

In 2003, rumors began swirling that a Harry Potter themed attraction would be coming to Universal or one of the Disney parks. On May 31, 2007, Universal, in partnership with Warner Bros., officially announced that the Wizarding World of Harry Potter would be built as the seventh of the Islands of Adventure park. The attraction opened on June 18, 2010.

Shortly after the success of the grand opening of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Hogsmeade, rumors began to swirl once again, this time of a second Potter-themed area in Universal Studios Florida. It was announced shortly thereafter that Universal would begin construction of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley, replacing Jaws: The Ride. On July 8, 2014, Diagon Alley officially opened to the public.

The Blackstone Group sold its stake in Universal Orlando in early 2011. As of 2015, Universal Orlando Resort occupies .

As of 2024, Universal Orlando Resort currently occupies of land with the expansion of Universal Epic Universe.

===Universal Studios Florida===

The original theme park in the resort, Universal Studios Florida, opened on June 7, 1990, as a theme park that let visitors &quot;Ride the Movies.&quot; The park is composed of themed areas, rides, and attractions based on the film industry. Visitors also get to experience themed dining, shopping, and a variety of special events throughout the year.

The themes of Universal Studios Florida are targeted at making guests feel like they are on movie sets with rides, shows and attractions inspired by popular film, television, and music productions. The park currently consists of eight themed areas – Hollywood, Illumination&#x27;s Minion Land, New York, San Francisco, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley, World Expo, Springfield, and DreamWorks Land.

===Universal Islands of Adventure===
The second park to open at the resort was Universal Islands of Adventure, opened on May 28, 1999. It is composed of eight distinct &quot;islands&quot; that are themed to various forms of literature, adventure genres, cartoons and comics, and mythical fantasies. Visitors start off in the Port of Entry and make their way through the various islands – Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon Lagoon, Skull Island, Jurassic Park, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Hogsmeade, the Lost Continent and Seuss Landing. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, based on the popular &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise, as well as Skull Island, based on the 2005 &quot;King Kong&quot; film, are the only islands that were added after the park opened. Hogsmeade opened to the public on June 18, 2010, and Skull Island opened to the public on July 13, 2016.

===Universal Volcano Bay===
Volcano Bay is the third (and first ever) 27-acre water theme park opened in 2017. It replaced Wet &#x27;n Wild, which was owned by Universal. Wet &#x27;n Wild was founded in 1977 by SeaWorld founder George Millay as one of the first major water parks. In 1998, Wet &#x27;n Wild was acquired by Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences, adding it to Universal Orlando. There were eighteen water slides and attractions at the water park. Popular attractions included the Storm, Bomb Bay, Disco H2O, Mach 5, and the Surge.

Wet &#x27;n Wild was located at the intersection of International Drive and Universal Boulevard, about half a mile south of the Universal Orlando parking garage. Wet &#x27;n Wild officially closed on December 31, 2016, due to the opening of Volcano Bay. It was announced on March 21, 2017, that the land once occupied by Wet &#x27;n Wild would be transformed into Universal&#x27;s seventh hotel. It was later announced that Universal would split the property into two hotels that were part of one resort.

===Universal Epic Universe===

On August 1, 2019, NBCUniversal announced that it would be building a fourth theme park called Universal Epic Universe. It will be located a few miles south of the existing resort, within a larger 750-acre site. There will be five lands including a central hub, Celestial Park, and four other areas themed to &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, Wizarding Paris from the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; franchise, Universal Monsters and Super Nintendo World. It was stated that the project would create 14,000 jobs. Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, called Epic Universe &quot;the largest investment we&#x27;ve ever made in a park&quot;. The complex will also include three new resort hotels, dining, and retail facilities.

In April 2020, NBCUniversal announced the park&#x27;s opening would be delayed until 2024 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, NBCUniversal announced that they would be pausing development on the new theme park &quot;until the future becomes more certain&quot;. In March 2021, work on Epic Universe resumed.

Epic Universe is slated to open on May 22, 2025.

==Entertainment district==

Universal CityWalk Orlando is an entertainment and retail district which opened on May 28, 1999, over the former parking lot and entrance of Universal Studios as part of the expansion that created the Universal Orlando Resort. Guests arrive at the resort in one of two multi-story parking structures, then travel via covered moving walkways over Universal Boulevard into CityWalk. From there, guests can proceed into one of the two theme parks.

The Universal Store is its flagship store, offering merchandise from the three parks. CityWalk features shopping, nightclubs, dining venues, and a Cinemark Theatres and offers varying live music and entertainment options each night.

==Resorts==
The resort features eight official on-site hotels, totaling up to 11,000 rooms. All 11 hotels are located in close proximity to the Universal Orlando theme parks. The hotels offer guests free water taxi or shuttle bus service to the Universal Orlando theme parks. The hotels are sorted into three categories: Signature Collection, Prime Value Hotels, and Value Inn and Suites.

==Events==
===Universal&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights===

On select nights in September through early November, Universal Studios Florida is transformed for the annual Halloween event, Halloween Horror Nights. Halloween Horror Nights, or HHN as it is more commonly known, is one of the largest Halloween events in the U.S. From 1991 to 2001, the event was held at Universal Studios Florida. Halloween Horror Nights was moved to Islands of Adventure in 2002, and the 2004 event featured sections of both parks, but the event was moved back to Universal Studios Florida in 2006. The event celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2010, its 25th anniversary in 2015, and the 30th anniversary in 2021. The event sometimes features an &quot;icon&quot; that presides over the terror each evening, along with seven to ten haunted houses and numerous unavoidable scare zones. It is a separately ticketed event.

===Rock the Universe===

Rock the Universe is an annual Christian rock music festival that is located within Universal Studios Florida. It began in 1998 and has been running ever since. The event typically occurs in early September and lasts for two days. In 2019, Rock the Universe took place in early February for the first time ever. Many Christian rock artists play throughout the event both nights. The resort offers special tickets, packages and church partnerships for that weekend. Select attractions are also open throughout the evenings.

===Grad Bash and Gradventure===
Grad Bash and Gradventure are two separate events held in April and May at the parks. Grad Bash is an event for graduating high school senior classes who can gather for an exclusive, all-night party at Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure. It allows attendees to ride all attractions at both parks. This event also features live performances by some of the most popular artists, dance parties with DJs, and pre-parties at the Universal Music Plaza Stage in the Production Central section of Universal Studios Florida. Gradventure is very similar but is promoted for graduating middle school students. Both events are sponsored by Coca-Cola.

== Attendance ==
The longstanding rivalry between Universal Orlando Resort and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, is set to intensify in 2025 with the opening of Universal&#x27;s Epic Universe, a new theme park featuring attractions based on Nintendo, Harry Potter, and other properties. This development marks a significant step in Universal&#x27;s ongoing efforts to challenge Disney&#x27;s dominance in the Central Florida tourism market. Analysts from MoffettNathanson estimate that Epic Universe could draw approximately one million visitors away from Disney World between mid-2025 and 2026.
==Other services==
===Universal Express Pass===
Many attractions in Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure allow guests to utilize Express Pass, with availability depending at each attraction. This pass admits guests to a separate line for the attraction, which is given priority status when boarding.

Express Pass is not a virtual queuing service. Instead, passholders may enter the Universal Express line whenever they wish. This pass is not included with park admission but can be bought for an additional fee. Fees change depending on date. Guests can choose to purchase one of two options: Express Pass, which gives guests access to an Express line once per day on each participating attraction, or Express Unlimited Pass, which allows guests to skip the regular lines an unlimited number of times per day at participating attractions.

===Universal Meal Deal===
The Universal Meal Deal was a ticketed meal plan for park visitors. It allowed visitors of either theme park to eat all day long from lunch through dinner at select restaurants. These included Mel&#x27;s Drive-In and Louie&#x27;s Italian Restaurant at Universal Studios Florida and Circus McGurkus Cafe Stoo-pendous, Comic Strip Cafe, and the Burger Digs at Islands of Adventure.

The selection food was limited and drinks were not included. Beverages could be purchased through a Universal Souvenir Cup. For additional costs, visitors could add park-to-park Meal Deal Access allowing them to eat meals in both parks.

Universal Meal Deal was replaced on November 3, 2013, with Universal Quick Service Dining Plan.

===Character dining===
Universal Orlando features a large group of characters varying from Woody Woodpecker to Spider-Man. Visitors have three ways of dining with characters. At Loews Royal Pacific Resort, guests can eat breakfast with Universal Characters on select days. Throughout the day, characters have meet and greets within the parks and make appearances during lunchtime at several theme park restaurants. During dinner, on select nights, guests can dine with Universal characters at Trattoria del Porto, The Kitchen and Islands Dining Room. The Marvel Super Heroes also appear in the Meet the Marvel Super Heroes attraction where the characters ride on motorcycles down the street of Marvel Super Hero Island.

<doc id="702407" wikidata="Q5518861" url="?curid=702407" title="Gallant Fox">
<text>Gallant Fox (March 23, 1927 – November 13, 1954) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the second winner of the American Triple Crown.

In a racing career which lasted from 1929 to 1930, Gallant Fox won 11 of his 17 races including the three Triple Crown races. The term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; was not commonly used at the time but was employed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to describe the colt&#x27;s achievements.

==Background==

Gallant Fox was a bay colt with a white blaze, was foaled at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, and was one of many leading American racehorses sired by the French-bred stallion Sir Gallahad III. His dam was the mare Marguerite, who also produced Gallant Fox&#x27;s full brother Fighting Fox, whose wins included the Grand Union Hotel Stakes, the Wood Memorial Stakes, and the Carter Handicap. Owned by the Belair Stud of Collington, Maryland, Gallant Fox was trained by &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Fitzsimmons and ridden in his major victories by Earl Sande. Early in his career, Gallant Fox was known for being distracted at times, supposedly being late out of the gate in his maiden race due to an airplane flying overhead. Gallant Fox also would become reluctant to run unless there was at least one other horse accompanying him. To help work him out, Fitzsimmons would have other horses placed around the track ahead of Gallant Fox, so he would chase after them.

==Racing career==
In 1929, Gallant Fox won twice, taking the Flash Stakes and the Cowdin Stakes, but in his biggest test he finished third to Harry Payne Whitney&#x27;s Whichone in the Belmont Futurity Stakes.

The colt was regarded as a major contender for 1930&#x27;s major three-year-old races and confirmed his status with a win in the Wood Memorial Stakes, beating Crack Brigade by four lengths at Jamaica Race Course in April.

In May, Gallant Fox started as the favorite for the Preakness Stakes, that year the first of the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; races. Ridden by Earl Sande, he took the lead early in the straight and held the late challenge of Crack Brigade by three quarters of a length. The win was enthusiastically received with the popular Sande smiling and raising his whip to the crowd. The Kentucky Derby, two weeks later, attracted a crowd of 50,000 despite heavy rain at Louisville, and Gallant Fox started favorite. He broke slowly but took the lead on the backstretch from the filly Alcibiades before winning by two lengths from Gallant Knight, completing the course in 2:07 3/5 on a muddy track. Sande won the race for a record third time, following victories on Zev and Flying Ebony. By this time, Gallant Fox was becoming known as &quot;the red-headed-horse&quot; because of the bright red hood he wore in his races, and was also called &quot;The Fox of Belair&quot; or simply &quot;The Fox.&quot; At Belmont Park three weeks later, he won the Belmont Stakes from Whichone, who had missed the Derby but won the Withers Stakes and had been favored to win by many &quot;experts&quot;. Before the end of June, Gallant Fox added a win in the Dwyer Stakes at odds of 1/10, although the lack of effective opposition (Whichone missed the race through injury) made the victory a &quot;hollow&quot; one. By July, Gallant Fox was being described as a &quot;super horse&quot; and about 60,000 were in attendance at Arlington Park near Chicago when he won the Arlington Classic by a neck from Gallant Knight with the top weight of 126 pounds.

Gallant Fox and Whichone met again in August in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga, but in a huge upset, they finished second and third to 100/1 outsider Jim Dandy, who appeared ideally suited for the muddy track and won by three lengths. Fitzsimmons blamed the state of the ground for the colt&#x27;s defeat and claimed that he had only run on the insistence of his owner. In the Lawrence Realization Stakes at Belmont Park in September, Gallant Fox, by then generally acknowledged as the champion of the year, defeated Questionnaire by a nose. His win took his earnings to $317,865, surpassing the world record held since 1923 by Zev. By the end of a season, Gallant Fox had increased his earnings to $328,165, although the record lasted only a year before it was beaten by Sun Beau.

In October, after wins against older horses in the Saratoga Cup and the Jockey Club Gold Cup, it was announced that Gallant Fox would be retired to stud. At the end of the year, he was described as &quot;easily the outstanding Thoroughbred&quot; of 1930. Although at the time there was no organized &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; award, &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; retrospective named Gallant Fox as the 1930 American Horse of the Year. The most respected Thoroughbred racing magazine in North America and now owned by The Jockey Club, &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; commissioned an exhaustive review covering the period 1887 through 1935 to provide their list of national Champions that is used by the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and Churchill Downs, Inc., among others.

== Race record ==
==Stud career==
Gallant Fox was retired to stud after the 1930 racing season and had a twenty-two year breeding career. Among his progeny were 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha and Granville, the 1936 Horse of the Year. He also sired Omaha&#x27;s full brother Flares, who in 1938 became only the second American-bred to ever win England&#x27;s Ascot Gold Cup.

Gallant Fox was the first US Triple Crown winner to sire a second-generation Triple Crown champion when his son Omaha won the U.S. Triple Crown in 1935. Fifty-eight years later, in 1993, Affirmed became the second when his son, Peteski, won the Canadian Triple Crown.

Gallant Fox died on November 13, 1954, and was buried at Claiborne Farm. His epitaph famously reads, &quot;He swept like a meteor across the racing sky of 1930.&quot; In 1957, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Blood-Horse magazine&#x27;s ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century listed Gallant Fox at #28.

<doc id="702413" wikidata="Q1093644" url="?curid=702413" title="Kodashim">
<text>Kodashim () is the fifth of the six orders, or major divisions, of the Mishnah, Tosefta and the Talmud, and deals largely with the services within the Temple in Jerusalem, its maintenance and design, the &quot;korbanot&quot;, or sacrificial offerings that were offered there, and other subjects related to these topics, as well as, notably, the topic of kosher slaughter.

==Topics==
This Seder (order, or division) of the Mishnah is known as Kodashim (“sacred things” or “sanctities”), because it deals with subjects connected with Temple service and ritual slaughter of animals (&quot;shehitah&quot;). The term &quot;kodashim&quot;, in the Biblical context, applies to the sacrifices, the Temple and its furnishings, as well as the priests who carried out the duties and ceremonies of its service; and it is with these holy things, places and people that Kodashim is mainly concerned. The title Kodashim is apparently an abbreviation of &quot;Shehitat Kodashim&quot; (&quot;the slaughter of sacred animals&quot;) since the main, although not the only subject of this order is sacrifices.

The topics of this Seder are primarily the sacrifices of animals, birds, and meal offerings, the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the sin offering and the guilt offering, and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property. In addition, the order contains a description of the Second Temple (tractate Middot), and a description and rules about the daily sacrifice service in the Temple (tractate Tamid). The order also includes tractate Hullin, which concerns the slaughter of animals for non-sacrificial use, as well as other dietary laws applying to meat and animal products. Although Hullin is about the slaughter of animals for non-sacrificial, and therefore unsanctified purposes, because the rules about the proper slaughter of animals and birds, and their ritual fitness for use were considered to be an integral part of the concept of holiness in Judaism, they were also included in the order regarding “holy things”.

==Contents==
Seder Kodashim comprises eleven tractates, with a total of 90 chapters, as follows:

* Zevachim (“Sacrifices”), with fourteen chapters, and originally called &quot;Shehitat Kodashim&quot; (&quot;slaughtering of the holy animals&quot;) deals with the sacrificial system of the Temple period, namely the laws for animal and bird offerings, and the conditions which make them acceptable or not, as specified in the Torah, primarily in the book of Leviticus ( and on).
* Menachot (&quot;Meal Offerings&quot;), comprising thirteen chapters, deals with the rules regarding the preparation and presentation of grain-meal and drink offerings, including the meal-offering that was burnt on the altar and the remainder that was consumed by the priests as specified in the Torah ( and on); the bringing of the &quot;omer&quot; of barley (), the two loaves (), and the showbread ().
* Hullin or Chullin (&quot;Ordinary or Mundane&quot;), also called also &quot;Shehitat Hullin&quot; (&quot;slaughtering of non-consecrated animals&quot;), has twelve chapters and deals with the laws for slaughtering animals and birds for meat for ordinary use, as opposed to sacred use, with other rules relating to the eating of meat, and with the dietary laws in general.
* Bekhorot (&quot;Firstborns&quot;), consists of nine chapters and deals mainly with the sanctification and redemption of human and animal firstborns, as specified in the Torah (, and ), and the tithing of cattle ().
* Arakhin (&quot;Dedications&quot; or “Estimations”), with nine chapters, deals with the rules for determining the amount which must be paid in fulfilment of a vow to dedicate to the Temple the &#x27;market-value&#x27; or &#x27;worth&#x27; of a person, field or object in accordance with the Torah (), or voluntary contributions to the upkeep of the Temple, and also with laws relating to the Jubilee year ().
* Temurah (&quot;Substitution&quot;), comprising seven chapters, outlines the rules about the substitution of one sacrificial animal for another in accordance with the Torah’s instructions ().
* Keritot (&quot;Excisions&quot;), with six chapters, deals with the transgressions for which the penalty is &quot;karet&quot;, meaning, sins punishable by premature or sudden death, or being cut off from the community of Israel, if done deliberately, and the type of sin-offering sacrifice that had to be offered to effect atonement if the transgression was committed in error.
* Me&#x27;ilah (“Sacrilege” or &quot;Trespass&quot;), with six chapters, deals with laws concerning disrespectful treatment of property belonging to the Temple or using holy objects in a prohibited manner, and with restitution for the misappropriation of Temple property, in accordance with .
* Tamid (&quot;The Daily Sacrifice&quot;, lit. “The Continual [Offering]”), with seven chapters (in most editions), outlines the Temple service for the daily morning and evening sacrifice, known as the &quot;Korban Tamid&quot;, in accordance with the Torah ( and ).
* Middot (&quot;Measurements&quot; or “Dimensions”), comprises five chapters containing descriptions of the Second Temple’s architecture including its courts, gates and halls; its furnishings such as the Altar; and an account of the service of the priestly workshifts in the Temple.
* Kinnim (&quot;Nests&quot;), with three chapters, deals with the instructions regarding the offering of birds, in penitence for certain offences and certain conditions of uncleanness, as described in the Torah (, and ); and discusses the case in which birds belonging to different persons or to different offerings have become mixed up with one another; the name of the tractate (nests) refers to the pairs of birds prescribed in the Torah as offerings ().

==Structure==
This Seder, or order, has eleven tractates, arranged, like most of the orders of the Mishnah, mostly in descending sequence according to the number of chapters.

The traditional reasoning for the order of the tractates according to Maimonides, beyond the ordering according to number of chapters, is that &quot;Zevahim&quot; is first as it deals with the main physical purpose of the Temple, namely, animal sacrifices. &quot;Menahot&quot; continuing the subject of offerings, and so is placed next, according to the scriptural order and the status of meal-offerings as supplementary to the meat offerings. After dealing with offerings to the Temple, &quot;Hullin&quot; follows, dealing with the related topic of &quot;secular&quot; slaughter for meat. &quot;Bekhorot&quot;, &quot;Arakhin&quot; and &quot;Temurah&quot; all discuss auxiliary laws of sanctity and follow the order in which they appear in the Torah. &quot;Keritot&quot; then follows, as it largely discusses the offering for the transgression of certain commandments, and &quot;Me&#x27;ilah&quot; follows that as it also deals with transgressions of sanctity, although of a lighter nature. After dealing with laws, two mostly descriptive tractates were added, &quot;Tamid&quot; discussing the daily sacrifice and &quot;Middot&quot; which overviews the Temple in Jerusalem. Finally, &quot;Kinnim&quot; was placed last as its laws deal with accidental and rarely occurring situations.

In the Babylonian Talmud the sequence of the treatises follows the general order except that Bekorot is before Hullin, and Ḳinnim is placed before Tamid and Middot.

==Talmud and Tosefta==
As part of the Mishnah, the first major composition of Jewish law and ethics based on the Oral Torah, Kodashim was compiled and edited between 200–220 CE by Judah ha-Nasi and his colleagues. Subsequent generations produced a series of commentaries and deliberations relating to the Mishnah, known as the &quot;Gemara&quot;, which together with the Mishna are the &quot;Talmud&quot;, one produced in the Land of Israel 300–350 CE (the Jerusalem Talmud), and second, more extensive Talmud compiled in Babylonia and published 450–500 CE (the Babylonian Talmud).

In the Babylonian Talmud, all the tractates have Gemara for all their chapters except for Tamid which has it only for three chapters and Middot and Kinnim which don&#x27;t have any

Although the subject matter was no longer directly relevant to life in the Babylonian academies, the Gemara was motivated by the idea that the study of the laws of the Temple service is a substitute for the service itself. Also, the rabbinic sages wanted to merit the rebuilding of the Temple by paying special attention to these laws. However, in the modern Daf Yomi cycle and in the printed editions of the Babylonian Talmud, the Mishnah for the last two tractates are added at the end, to “complete” the order.

The Jerusalem Talmud has no Gemara on any of the tractates of Kodashim. Maimonides, however, mentions of the existence of a Jerusalem Talmud Gemara to Kodashim; however, it is doubtful he had seen it, as he is not known to have cited it anywhere. Nonetheless, this order was a subject of study in the Talmudic academies of the Land of Israel, as many statements contained in the Gemara of the Babylonian Talmud are attributed to the rabbinic scholars known as Amoraim in the Land of Israel. The assumption is that there was once a Jerusalem Talmud Gemara to Kodashim but that it has been lost.

There is a Tosefta for the tractates Zevahim, Hullin, Bekhorot, Arakhin, Temurah, Me&#x27;ilah, and Keritot. Tamid, Middot and Kinnim have no Tosefta.

<doc id="702414" wikidata="Q880811" url="?curid=702414" title="Oliver P. Morton">
<text>Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton (August 4, 1823 – November 1, 1877), commonly known as Oliver P. Morton, was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana. He served as the 14th governor of Indiana during the American Civil War, and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln. Morton worked hard to maximize Indiana&#x27;s contribution to the war effort and marginalize the obstructionists. He was a principled and effective leader who fought for equality and nationalism through the use of governmental power. His forceful pursuit of civil rights and prosecution of Copperheads and white supremacists gained him lasting enemies among the antiwar elements. Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly. He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval, and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans. He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers. As one of President Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;war governors&quot;, Morton made significant contributions to the war effort, more than any other man in the state, and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support.

During his second term as governor, and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke, he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era, and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy. In 1877, during his second term in the Senate, Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health; he died later that year. Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands. He is buried in Indianapolis&#x27;s Crown Hill Cemetery.

==Early life==

===Family and background===
Morton was an Indiana native born in Wayne County near the small settlement of Salisbury on August 4, 1823, to James Throck and Sarah Miller Morton. His grandfather had shortened the family&#x27;s surname, Throckmorton, to Morton, but the males in the family carried Throck as a middle name. He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, the victorious Commodore in the Battle of Lake Erie. Morton disliked his name from an early age, and before beginning his political career he shortened it to Oliver Perry Morton, dropping the middle names of Hazard and Throck. His mother died when he was three, and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. He spent most of his young life living with them in Ohio.

Morton returned to eastern Indiana as a young man, and joined his family at Centerville. Leaving school at the age of fifteen, Morton briefly worked as an apothecary&#x27;s clerk, but left after a dispute with the proprietor and apprenticed as a hat maker. After four years in the hat-making business he became dissatisfied and quit to enroll at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he studied for two years and was initiated into Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He then briefly attended Cincinnati College to continue his law studies. In 1845 he returned to Centerville and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1846. Morton formed a law practice with Judge Newman and became a successful and moderately wealthy attorney. John F. Kibbey, the man who Morton would later appoint as Indiana Attorney General, began studying law under Morton in Richmond in 1849. After Kibbey was admitted to the bar in 1852, he and Morton began to practice law together until 1860. Morton married Lucinda Burbank in 1845. The couple had five children, but only two survived infancy.

===Early political career===
In 1852 Morton campaigned and was elected to serve as a circuit court judge, but resigned after only a year; he found that he preferred to practice law. By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics. Initially, Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat, but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation. Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise&#x27;s ban on slavery in the western territories, beyond Missouri, had a divisive effect on both parties. As the Democrats divided over the issue, Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act. Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the state&#x27;s Democrats expelled their anti-slavery members, including Morton, from the Indiana state convention in 1854. That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People&#x27;s Party, the forerunner to the state&#x27;s Republican Party.

By February 1856 Morton had made his way to the newly formed Republican party at the national level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh. He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People&#x27;s/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting. Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism. Despite these criticisms, Morton&#x27;s anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana. Noted for his &quot;plain and convincing&quot; manner of speaking, Morton&#x27;s contemporaries said he was not &quot;eloquent or witty&quot;, but rather &quot;logical and reasonable&quot;.

By 1858, the People&#x27;s party had officially adopted the name of Republican, and in 1860 the Republicans nominated Morton for lieutenant governor of Indiana on a ticket with the more conservative former Whig, Henry S. Lane, as its gubernatorial candidate. Savvy Republican politicians thought that Morton would be seen as too radical and could not carry the former Know-Nothing vote in the southern half of the state, while a man of Whig antecedents like Lane would. Because both men had strong support within the party, and neither had much desire to make open war on one another, a compromise was arranged, giving Lane the gubernatorial nomination and Morton the nomination for lieutenant governor. Both nominees understood that if they carried the state and a Republican majority was elected to the state legislature in the fall, the Indiana General Assembly would choose Lane for a seat in the U.S. Senate and Morton would become the successor to the Indiana governorship. The campaign focused primarily on the prevailing issues of the nation, including homesteading legislation, tariffs, and the looming possibility of civil war. Lane and Morton won in the state&#x27;s general election and the Republicans gained control of the state legislature. As it had been pre-arranged with the candidates, on the day after Lane&#x27;s inauguration as governor, the General Assembly chose him to fill a U.S. Senate seat. Lane resigned immediately and Morton succeeded him to become the fourteenth governor of Indiana on January 18, 1861, and its first governor to be born in the state.

==Governor==

===War effort===
Morton served as governor of Indiana for six years (1861–1867) and strongly supported the Union during the Civil War. While others urged compromise and conciliation, Morton demanded an end to concession discussions, with no further compromise, and, if necessary, the use of force to preserve the Union. In a speech he delivered on November 22, 1860, Morton declared: &quot;If it is worth a bloody struggle to establish this nation, it is worth one to preserve it.&quot; He was also a staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s conduct of the war. Morton, who was not in favor of conciliation, believed his role as Indiana&#x27;s governor was &quot;to denounce treason and uphold the cause of the Union.&quot;

Morton also believed that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor. Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states. He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal, where up to 700 men produced ammunition, and made many other preparations for the impending war.

Three days after the war began on April 12, 1861, at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln offering 10,000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion. By the end of April, about 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union, exceeding the state&#x27;s initial quota of six regiments (4,683 men). In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24, 1861, Morton called for Indiana&#x27;s politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union. He also received the state legislature&#x27;s authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana&#x27;s troops.

Among Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;war governors&quot;, who were critically important in the early prosecution of the war, &quot;no governor played his role more valiantly or effectively than did Morton.&quot; Although Morton&#x27;s efforts were not without controversy and garnered significant opposition from his political adversaries, his greatest strength during the war was his ability to raise volunteers and money for the Union army and to equip them for battle. Morton also successfully suppressed Indiana&#x27;s Confederate sympathizers. As the leader of the Republicans in the state, he confronted the Peace Democrats, especially the &quot;Copperheads&quot;.

Lincoln and Morton maintained a close alliance during the war, although Lincoln was wary at times of Morton&#x27;s ruthlessness. Lincoln also recognized the Indiana governor had significant fears, once remarking that Morton was &quot;a good fellow, but at times he is the skeeredest person I know.&quot; Morton was especially afraid that Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Indiana&#x27;s southern border, would secede from the Union and pose a threat to Indiana&#x27;s security.

Morton went to great lengths to ensure that Indiana contributed as much as possible to the war effort. He was not afraid to criticize others if he felt Indiana&#x27;s interests were being overlooked. Morton frequently clashed with federal authorities and military leaders over recruitment policies, regimental assignments, appointment of military leaders, purchases of supplies, and the care given to sick and wounded soldiers, among other issues. Although he wanted Indiana to receive as much recognition as other states, Morton&#x27;s political opponents often challenged his efforts. Governor Morton once complained to Lincoln that &quot;no other free state is so populated with southerners&quot;, which he believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be.

In 1862 Morton attended the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation. Emancipation and the conscription of men to fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton&#x27;s tenure as governor.

===Conflict with the General Assembly===
Although Morton was able to keep the state united during the first phase of the war, once emancipation became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, the conduct of the war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.

Morton had already made several unconstitutional moves by acting on his own authority without legislative approval, including the establishment of the state arsenal, and the Democrats drafted legislation that attempted to reduce his authority. When Democrats in the state legislature sought to remove the state militia from Morton&#x27;s command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners, the governor immediately disbanded the Indiana General Assembly. He feared that once in control of militia, the Democrats might attempt to force him from office and secede from the Union. Morton issued secret instructions to Republican legislators, asking them to stay away from Indianapolis, the state capital, to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the quorum needed to pass any legislation. All but four Republicans fled to Madison, Indiana, where they could quickly flee into Kentucky if the Democrats attempted to force their return to Indianapolis.

Without the enactment of an appropriations bill, the state government would not have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton would be forced to call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton&#x27;s move to subvert the state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state&#x27;s debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts.

Morton&#x27;s moves caused considerable rage among the Democrats, who launched a vicious attack on the governor. He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason. Following the suppression of the General Assembly in 1862, Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state&#x27;s levies for service. He also established an intelligence network under Carrington&#x27;s leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, and, beginning in 1863, the American Knights, which merged with the Sons of Liberty. Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war. Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure, but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests, suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association, and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority. In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue&#x27;s Run, Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention, where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested, detained, or threatened. Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity for the duration of the war, and met with some success. Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854, and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship, Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate.

In reaction to Morton&#x27;s actions against dissenters, the Indiana Democratic Party called Morton a &quot;Dictator&quot; and an &quot;Underhanded Mobster.&quot; Republicans countered that the Democrats were using &quot;treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war&quot;. Morton illegally—without approval from the state legislature—called out the state militia in July 1863 to counter Morgan&#x27;s Raid, an incident where Confederate raiders under Confederate General John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana. Large-scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and southern Hoosiers in general declined after Morgan&#x27;s raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle, despite their proclaimed support for the Confederate cause. After Hoosiers failed to support Morgan&#x27;s troops in significant numbers, Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers within the state, theorizing that because the Copperheads had failed to come to Morgan&#x27;s aid in large numbers, they would similarly fail to aid a larger invasion.

Despite his controversial actions, one notable thing historians record from this period during Morton&#x27;s first term as governor was the honesty with which the government was run. All of the borrowed money was accounted for with no political corruption and repaid in the years after the war. It was by these honest actions that Morton was able to avoid repercussions when the state legislature reconvened after Morton&#x27;s reelection, this time with a new Republican majority.

===Second term===
In 1864 the war was nearing its end, but many Hoosiers were war weary and saw no end in sight as they prepared for the state&#x27;s next gubernatorial election. Indiana&#x27;s constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight-year period, but Morton was elected as Indiana&#x27;s lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane&#x27;s term, so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election. The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton, who did not do a great deal of campaigning. Instead, he successfully returned about 9,000 active-duty soldiers home on leave to vote in the election, presumably for Morton, &quot;the soldier&#x27;s friend&quot;, and his fellow Republicans.

Morton was reelected to office, defeating Democrat and longtime friend Joseph McDonald by more than 20,000 votes. Although the campaign was conducted in time of war, with both parties strongly opposing the other, both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate. Many Democrats claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority in both houses of the Assembly.

Morton was partially crippled by a paralytic stroke in October 1865 which incapacitated him for a time. For treatment, Morton traveled to Europe where he sought the assistance of several specialists, but none were able to help his paralysis. During his recovery, Lieutenant Governor Conrad Baker served as acting governor. With the war ending, Baker oversaw the demobilization of most of the state&#x27;s forces. Morton returned to the governorship in March 1866, but he was never again able to walk without assistance.

==Senator==
===First term===
In 1867, Morton was elected by the Indiana General Assembly to serve as a U.S. Senator. He resigned from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker. In the U.S. Senate, Morton became a member of the foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader. He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections. Because of his stroke, Morton always sat while delivering his speeches, but he was noted by other senators for his effectiveness in speaking and debating.

Morton&#x27;s close observers saw a man of untiring activity, &quot;of unfaltering determination, quick as well as far-seeing...&quot; Restless and full of energy, one newspaper commentated, &quot;He accommodated himself with a kind of cynical indifference to his crippled body, as to a house badly out of repair, and dragged it about with him as a snail does a shell.&quot; As a U.S. Senator, &quot;he excused himself from no duties; acted as chairman and member of several committees; was never absent from his seat, and was ready for debate at all times.&quot;

Unfriendly sources described Morton in exceedingly negative terms. &quot;With a superabundance of the quality called &#x27;force,&#x27; Senator Morton possesses one of the most terrible natures in public life,&quot; and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him: &quot;A dark, determined, brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his warthy complexion and introspective eyes. His powerful frame, prematurely wrecked, yet carrying alive the savage will, towers on his crutch, and in his very hobble is the tyrant&#x27;s pace... He wants to be terrible for the sake of freedom. His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism. Like all bloody bigots, he thinks he feels God&#x27;s mercy moving in him.&quot;

Morton, who served in the U.S. Senate during Reconstruction, supported much of the Radical Republican program for re-making the former Confederate states. Early in his first term, Morton supported legislation to eliminate all civil government in the southern states and impose a military government. He also supported legislation to void the southern states&#x27; constitutions—in nearly every case imposed in 1865 without being submitted to the voters—and to require elections for representatives to state constitutional conventions that would be charged with writing new ones. In addition, he voted in favor of provisions declaring that the new state constitutions would go into effect only if adopted by a majority of registered voters, not just those voting in the special elections that called for the constitutions&#x27; adoption. At the same time, he favored stringent restrictions on former Confederates who were permitted to vote, in particular those who had taken an oath to support the United States Constitution, and had served the Confederate States of America in a political office or in its military.

During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Morton voted in favor of conviction, as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans, and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson&#x27;s acquittal. Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote, and once worked to end Indiana&#x27;s so-called &quot;Black Laws&quot; that restricted blacks&#x27; basic civil rights, and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state, he reversed his position after the war. By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise. As he explained, &quot;I confess, and I do it without shame, that I have been educated by the great events of War.&quot; He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum, Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed.

U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar once judged Morton as a man with &quot;little regard for Constitutional scruples.&quot; Not that Morton would have willfully flouted his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, but Hoar added, &quot;he believed that the Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the Declaration of Independence, so as to be the law of life to a great, powerful, and free people. To this principle of interpretation, all strict or narrow criticism, founded on its literal meaning, must yield.&quot; If so, Hoar&#x27;s assessment put Morton in the same category as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner, who openly declared the Declaration&#x27;s decree that all men were created equal the defining words by which all constitutional duty should be judged.

After President-elect Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s inauguration in 1869, Morton became one of the Grant administration&#x27;s most able and reliable floor leaders. Morton helped shepherd through the bill readmitting Virginia to representation in Congress and voted in favor of the treaty annexing Santo Domingo to the United States. Later, he countered Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in a bitter debate over the president&#x27;s motives and intentions towards the Caribbean nation and its people. In the Senate Morton argued in favor of the Enforcement Act (1871), also known as the so-called Ku-Klux Act, that gave the president expanded power to oppose terrorism in the Deep South. Morton, known as a masterful waver of the &quot;bloody shirt&quot;, was unstinting in his efforts to connect the Democrats to wartime treason and peacetime violence, and generally could be relied on to provide a ready and strong defense of the federal government&#x27;s right to intervene and enforce the protection of the civil rights of black Americans. Morton championed the right of Louisiana&#x27;s black leader, Pinckney B. S. Pinchback, to a seat in the U.S. Senate, although the effort was unsuccessful. Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1875, and had his strongest support in 1876 among black Republicans in an increasingly &quot;solid South&quot;.

The Grant administration, who recognized Morton as a powerful friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton&#x27;s ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered a place on the Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).

===Second term===
Morton was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1873, and began his second term in 1874. His stand on paper money added to his controversial reputation. During a time of serious economic hardship and deflation, Morton favored a bill that would have added more paper currency to the money supply. He began his second term by leading the Senate&#x27;s support for an inflation bill that President Grant vetoed. Morton&#x27;s action was politically astute. In Indiana the demands for easy money topped the Democrats&#x27; list of priority issues, and in the fall of 1874, they carried the state&#x27;s elections largely on that basis. However, within a year, Morton joined other Republicans in supporting the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which effectively suspended new currency issues and gave the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury the authority to withdraw currency from circulation.

In 1876 Morton was a contender for the Republican nomination for president at the party&#x27;s National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio. Richard W. Thompson offered Morton&#x27;s name to the delegation at a nominee, but Morton&#x27;s position on issuing paper money to inflate the currency, combined with his failing health, hurt his bid for the nomination among the convention delegates. However, neither of these issues made as much difference as Morton&#x27;s association with the deeply discredited and scandal-ridden Grant administration. Morton&#x27;s nomination would have made the Republicans vulnerable on both the Reconstruction and corruption issues. In addition, Grant&#x27;s supporters had an alternative choice in U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Between the two nominees, the &quot;stalwart&quot; Republican bloc was divided, with no prospect of coming together because Conkling and Morton detested one another. When the balloting began, Morton&#x27;s vote total placed him second to James G. Blaine, but Morton had slipped to fourth place by the sixth ballot. Blaine&#x27;s opponents could only stop Blaine&#x27;s nomination by uniting behind a candidate acceptable to reform-minded delegates and the stalwart bloc. On the seventh ballot nearly all the anti-Blaine delegates, including Morton&#x27;s, united to give Rutherford B. Hayes the Republican nomination.

Morton ranked as one of the strongest members of the so-called &quot;stalwart&quot; faction of the Republican party: those members most deeply committed to protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South. Not surprisingly, during the winter of 1876–77, Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes&#x27;s right to the presidency in a close election. When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission, the group that determined the outcome of the election, there was never any doubt that his vote would be cast for Hayes. After Hayes&#x27;s supporters made overtures to southern Democrats, offering assurances that the president-elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina, there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties. In one speech Morton made it clear that the Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks, before he would support Hayes&#x27;s program. The guarantees were given, or at least promises were made. To the general surprise of many, Hayes&#x27;s policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states, and Morton proved to be one of the president&#x27;s strongest defenders, urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so-called &quot;New Departure&quot; time to prove itself.

===Death===

In 1877 Morton was named to lead a committee to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover, a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon. The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations. On the return trip, Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit. After dinner on the night of August 6, Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory, where he was met by his brother-in-law, John A. Burbank, the former governor of the Dakota Territory. Morton was accompanied by him to the home of his mother-in-law in Richmond, Indiana, where he stayed until October 15, then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover. He remained at Indianapolis, surrounded by his family, until his death on November 1, 1877.

Morton&#x27;s remains were laid in state at the Indiana Statehouse, before their removal to Indianapolis&#x27;s Roberts Park Methodist Church, where his funeral service was held. The service was attended by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff. Because the church could not hold the large crowd, thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis&#x27;s Crown Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Morton remains &quot;the most powerful, important, and controversial governor in Indiana history.&quot; To his admirers and supporters, Morton was a decisive, effective, ambitious, and energetic leader as governor of Indiana during the Civil War; his detractors would describe him as a wily and power-hungry politician, who shifted his stance on issues to suit prevailing views for his own political gain. Although his tactics were controversial, and on occasion unconstitutional, he remained a dominant political figure from 1861 to 1877. As one of Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;war governors&quot;, Morton was most successful in recruiting and equipping Union troops during the Civil War, and became known as &quot;the soldier&#x27;s friend&quot;, in tribute to his crucial efforts in supplying and supporting the Union soldiers in the field. Morton was also known for standing firm against his political opponents, whom he often antagonized by his ruthlessness, and they frequently responded with severe criticism of his actions.

===Policies and criticism===
Morton had many critics during his long tenure in government service. They derided the manner in which he ran Indiana&#x27;s state government during the Civil War and criticized his open suppression of the freedom of speech, arrests and detentions of his political opponents, and violations of the state and federal constitutions on more than one occasion. Morton justified his forceful actions as &quot;a necessary wartime measure&quot; to protect Indiana and defend the Union. In the U.S. Senate he became one of the foremost defenders of Republican governments in the southern states. Recent historiography of Reconstruction has found Morton among the most consistent supporters of the cause of equal justice under the law.

Morton was a formidable personality, detested by his enemies, and vilified in opposition newspapers. According to one account, Morton had no leavening wit, no humor, no breadth of intellect, no sparkle of conversation, to attract those who disagreed with him politically. Another Republican was said to have declared, &quot;His presence is a deadly poison&quot; and &quot;He is a sphinx; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man.&quot; According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions, Morton was &quot;a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness, leprous ulcers and caustic bandages, who loads down with plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass.&quot; Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully, highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing, even defaming his enemies, and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer, forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor&#x27;s mansion. One Democratic journalist wrote, &quot;There is not, probably, in this country, a more conscienceless, corrupt, and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton&quot; and &quot;He is rotten physically, morally and politically.&quot; It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease, brought on by his habits. When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage, the Saint Paul &quot;Pioneer&quot; was not surprised. &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t Morton espouse the woman&#x27;s cause?&quot; it asked. &quot;It is woman that has made him what he is -- so the gossips say.&quot;

None of his critics could make charges of corruption stick. Senator Morton was among the earliest to refuse any share in the so-called &quot;back pay&quot; that Congress awarded its members in 1873, and returned his money to the U.S. Treasury as soon as it was given to him. Morton was untouched by the Crédit Mobilier scandal. A hostile Democratic House scoured the official files for some evidence of bribe-taking or shakedowns in awarding Civil War contracts, and came up empty-handed. For others, despite holding many positions that angered his opponents, Morton was highly regarded for remaining clean of graft during the war period when corruption was commonplace. For his honest conduct he was offered the thanks of the Indiana General Assembly and others on numerous occasions. After Morton learned that President Grant had nominated his son, John M. Morton, for Registrar of the Land Office in Dakota Territory, the Senator immediately wrote to ask that the selection be withdrawn, protest that he could not afford to have any relative appointed to any political office.

After the poor decision-making of Senators Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch, Morton succeeded in raising Indiana to national prominence during his lifetime. The state and its citizens were once the common subject of jokes to the eastern states, but much of that ceased after the Civil War.

===Memorials===
Morton is memorialized in the United States Capitol as one of Indiana&#x27;s two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection (&quot;Oliver P. Morton&quot;). A 1926 statue of Governor Morton by George Brewster serves as the Indiana State Memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, in honor of his role as a powerful wartime governor.

There are two statues of Morton in downtown Indianapolis. A statue on the east side of the Indiana Statehouse, facing Capitol Avenue, by sculptor Rudolf Schwarz was dedicated in 1907. The other statue, created by sculptor Frank Simmons, was installed in 1864 on Monument Circle, when it served as a city park, and was moved to its new location to become part of the Circle&#x27;s Indiana Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument around 1899.

A statue of Morton stands on the second floor of the Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond, Indiana, where a previous high school was named for him; the central section of the current high school is named Morton Hall in his honor. Morton Senior High School in Hammond, Indiana, home of the Morton Governors, is named after him. The annual yearbook of Centerville Senior High School in Centerville, Indiana, is called &quot;The Mortonian&quot; in honor of Gov. Morton. Morton County, Kansas, and Morton County, North Dakota, are named in his honor.

The Oliver P. Morton House at Centerville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

<text>Edward Tiffin (June 19, 1766 – August 9, 1829) was an American politician who served as the first governor of Ohio and later as a United States Senator from Ohio as a member of the Democratic-Republican party.

==Biography==
Sources indicate that he was born in Carlisle; however he may have been born in or near Workington — also in the then county of Cumberland, England. Tiffin attended the Latin school in Carlisle, and became an apprentice to a student of medicine in 1778. Six years later he completed his apprenticeship. His family emigrated to Virginia in 1783, and he began practicing medicine at the age of seventeen.
In 1789, he married Mary Worthington of Berkeley County, sister of future Governor of Ohio Thomas Worthington. She died, childless, in 1808. A year after their marriage, the Tiffins joined the Methodist church after hearing the preaching of Thomas Scott, who would be their neighbor and friend for many years. Bishop Asbury ordained Tiffin a deacon of the Methodist church November 19, 1792, authorizing him to preach. Tiffin and Worthington inherited sixteen slaves when Worthington&#x27;s father died. They each decided to manumit their slaves and move to the Northwest Territory, where slavery was outlawed. Tiffin headed westward, along with Thomas Worthington, in 1798, settling in Chillicothe, Ohio.

==Northwest Territory==
Tiffin became the first doctor in Chillicothe, traveling on horseback, day and night, to treat the afflicted. He arrived with a letter addressed to the governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair from George Washington, recommending him for public office. Tiffin served as the Speaker of the Territorial House of Representatives from 1799 to 1801 and as president of the 1802 Constitutional Convention, where he cast a tie-breaking vote to deny the voting franchise to the new state&#x27;s 337 African American residents. He was a leader of the Chillicothe Junto, a group of Chillicothe Democratic-Republican politicians who brought about the admission of Ohio as a state in 1803 and largely controlled its politics for some years thereafter. Among his colleagues in the faction were Thomas Worthington and Nathaniel Massie.

Tiffin was the obvious choice for the governorship when Ohio was admitted to the Union. He was elected almost without opposition to a first term and re-elected by similarly overwhelming numbers two years later. Tiffin acted promptly to stop the Burr conspiracy in his second term.

Tiffin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1806 and resigned the governorship in March 1807 to take his seat. He served only two years, however, resigning after the death of his wife. &quot;He was ever faithful to the interests of the West and diligent in seeking the welfare of its inhabitants. He procured an appropriation of public money for the improvement of the Ohio River. He secured better and speedier transportation of the mails; a better and more rapid system for the surveys of western lands; and urged such modifications of the laws regarding sales of western land as would, to use his own words, &#x27;guard the purchasers of them from unnecessary embarrassments and frequent ruin.&#x27; &quot; He also voted for the expulsion of the other Ohio Senator, John Smith, who had been implicated in the Burr conspiracy. He spent only a few months at home, however, before being elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served as speaker from 1809 to 1811. Tiffin remarried April 16, 1809, to Mary Porter, originally from Delaware, and then of Ross County. Tiffin became the first commissioner of the United States General Land Office, which managed allocations of Federal lands.

He quickly helped remove the Federal records from Washington before it was sacked during the War of 1812. In 1814, he became the Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory, exchanging positions with Josiah Meigs so that he might spend more time near his home in Chillicothe. Tiffin served in the post until his death.

==Death==
Tiffin was buried in Grandview Cemetery, Ross County, Ohio. His death was reported in the newspapers, such as this notice in the Brattleboro Messenger (Brattleboro, VT), Sep. 18, 1829, p. 3:
At Chillicothe, Doct. Edward Tiffin, formerly Governor of Ohio, and late Surveyor General of the United States, aged 64 years.

==Legacy==
The city of Tiffin in northwestern Ohio was named in honor of Tiffin in 1822.

<doc id="702431" wikidata="Q1054163" url="?curid=702431" title="Phnom Penh International Airport">
<text>Phnom Penh International Airport , formerly Pochentong International Airport , is the busiest international airport in Cambodia and serves as the country&#x27;s main international gateway. It is Cambodia&#x27;s second largest airport by area after the new Siem Reap–Angkor International Airport. It is located in the Pou Senchey District, west of Phnom Penh, the nation&#x27;s capital.

==History==
During the Japanese occupation of Cambodia they built as many as fifteen airports through the country, including on the site of the current airport. It is reported that these airports were built using slave labor. After independence from France in 1953, King Norodom Sihanouk ordered new airstrips or improvements to existing sites.

During the Cambodian War, the airport was used extensively for airlifts of military and civilian supplies. Between October and December 1973, C-130&#x27;s of the 374th Tactical Air Lift brought 3,000 tons of rice in via airlift. After the last land and water based routes fell into the hands of the Khmer Rouge in April 1975, the airport became the sole path for supplies for Phnom Penh.

After the collapse of the Khmer Republic in 1975, Pochentong was almost completely closed to international travel, with the exception of some flights directly from Beijing and Pyongyang. These flights consisted of cadres to train the new government, as well as some Cambodian intellectuals and diplomats who volunteered to return to the country.

In July 1995, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) signed a concession agreement with the French–Malaysian joint venture company. The company, Société Concessionaire d&#x27;Aéroport (SCA), is 70% owned by Vinci Airports and 30% owned by Muhibbah Masteron. In return for a 20-year concession, SCA committed to a $100 million improvement program.

In March 2011, Air France began flights to Paris via Bangkok using Airbus A340s. The stopover changed to Ho Chi Minh City the following year. The route lasted until March 2013.

In 2014 SCA and announced the start of the $100 million project to expand the passenger terminals at Phnom Penh and Siem Reap international airports to accommodate continued strong passenger growth. The project saw the extension of the parking lots and terminals, more check-in and immigration counters, and new baggage handling systems. Additionally, the commercial areas were enlarged to allow for more retail shops, new restaurants and food and beverage outlets, and mezzanine lounges to cater to first class and business travelers. The expansions allowed the airport to double its capacity to handle 5 million passengers a year from 2.5 million passengers.

In 2015, Cambodian opposition politician Son Chhay asked the government to rescind the concession agreement with SCA. He claimed that Cambodia &quot;may be getting ripped off in the deal&quot;.

In 2020, SCA lost the concession for Phnom Penh (along with Siem Reap) after plans were announced to build two new airports in those locations. Vinci Airports remained as the operator of Phnom Penh Airport.

==Future==
In January 2018, the Cambodian government approved a proposal to build a new airport to serve Phnom Penh that will cost an estimated US$1.5 billion. The new international airport will replace the existing Phnom Penh International Airport, with initial plans having the facilities being constructed on partially reclaimed land adjacent to Boueng Cheung Loung, a large lake in Kandal Province about 30 kilometres south of Phnom Penh.

Cambodia Airport Investment, a joint venture 90 percent owned by Overseas Cambodia Investment Corporation (OCIC), one of the country&#x27;s largest real estate developers, and 10 percent by the government&#x27;s State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, plans to invest the $1.5 billion to construct the new airport. The OCIC will invest US$280 million, while unspecified &quot;foreign banks&quot; will provide US$1.1 billion in funding. The OCIC will own 90 per cent of the shares in the completed airport, with the rest going to the SSCA While the construction plans are still in the early stages of development, the 4F class airport will be capable of handling large long-haul aircraft and will reportedly cover an area of around 2,600 hectares, which would make it one of the largest airports in the world.

In 2020, then Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that Phnom Penh airport would remain active after the new airport was activated, primarily serving as air freight, military, local flights, private flights and high-level visitors.

==Facilities==
===Overview===
The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 05/23 with an asphalt surface measuring . The airport has two terminal buildings – one for international and one for domestic operations. Recently, it added a new facility for VIP service. The international terminal has four aerobridges built in 2003. Three more aerobridges were added during the passenger terminal expansion in 2016–2017. The airport&#x27;s design capacity is 5 million people per year.

== Ground transportation ==

There are a few options to transfer to or from Phnom Penh International Airport and the city. Outside the arrival hall, passengers can take a taxi provided by the Airport Taxi Association or book a ride from Grab, a ride-hailing app. In April 2018, trains operated by Royal Railway Cambodia began running express from Phnom Penh International Airport (parking area) to Phnom Penh railway station (City Center). Trains run every 30 minutes and the journey takes roughly 30 minutes, fare of one-way is US$2.50. There is also the city bus and an airport express bus.

==Accidents and incidents==
*3 December 1973: A Douglas DC-3 XW-PHV of Air Union was reported to have crashed shortly after take-off.
*19 January 1975 A Douglas C-47A XU-HAK, Douglas DC-3 XU-KAL of Khmer Hansa and Douglas C-47A N86AC of South East Asia Air Transport were all destroyed in a rocket attack on the airport.
*22 February 1975: A Douglas C-47A XU-GAJ of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.
*10 March 1975: A Douglas DC-3 of Samaki Airlines was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.
*11 March 1975: ADouglas DC-3 of Khmer Hansa was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.
*xx March 1975: A Vickers Viscount XW-TDN of Royal Air Lao crashed at Phnom Penh International Airport. The pilot was not qualified to fly the aircraft. All four people on board were killed. &quot;Accident aircraft also reported as XW-TFK with a date of 15 March.
*11 April 1975: A Douglas DC-3 (possibly XW-PKT) of Sorya Airlines was hit by shrapnel shortly after take-off. The aircraft was destroyed by fire and two of the three occupants were killed. The same day, Douglas C-47B XW-TFB of Air Cambodge was damaged beyond economic repair in a rocket attack.
*3 September 1997: Vietnam Airlines Flight 815, operated by a Tupolev Tu-134 crashed on approach to Pochentong Airport, killing 65 of the 66 passengers on board. The aircraft was entirely destroyed. The aircraft was flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh. The Tupolev was approaching the Phnom Penh airport runway in heavy rain from 2,000 meters; at this point the control tower ordered the pilot to attempt an approach from the west due to a wind pick-up. The crew then lost communication with the tower, and three minutes later the aircraft collided at low level with trees, damaging the left wing. The aircraft then slid 200 yards into a dry rice paddy before exploding. Pilot error was later identified as the cause of the crash; the pilot continued his landing descent from an altitude of 2,000 meters to 30 meters even though the runway was not in sight, and ignored pleas from his first officer and flight engineer to turn back. When the aircraft hit the trees, the pilot finally realized the runway was not in sight and tried to abort the approach; the flight engineer pushed for full power, but the aircraft lost control and veered left; the right engine then stalled, making it impossible to gain lift.

<text>Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG) is an American book publishing company, founded in 1946 by Roger Williams Straus Jr. and John C. Farrar. FSG is known for publishing literary books, and its authors have won numerous awards, including Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and Nobel Prizes. As of 1993, the publisher has been a division of Macmillan, whose parent company is the German publishing conglomerate Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.

== Founding ==
Farrar, Straus, and Company was founded in 1945 by Roger W. Straus Jr. and John C. Farrar. The first book was &quot;Yank: The G.I. Story of the War&quot;, a compilation of articles that appeared in &quot;Yank, the Army Weekly&quot;, then &quot;There Were Two Pirates&quot;, a novel by James Branch Cabell.

The first years of existence were rough until they published the diet book &quot;Look Younger, Live Longer&quot; by Gayelord Hauser in 1950. The book went on to sell 500,000 copies and Straus said that the book carried them along for a while. In the early years, Straus and his wife Dorothea, went prospecting for books in Italy. It was there that they found the memoir &quot;Christ Stopped at Eboli&quot; by Carlo Levi and other rising Italian authors: Alberto Moravia, Giovannino Guareschi and Cesare Pavese. Farrar, Straus also poached or lured away authors from other publishers—one was Edmund Wilson, who was unhappy with Random House at the time but remained with Farrar, Straus for the remainder of his career.

In 1950, the name changed to Farrar, Straus &amp; Young (for Stanley Young, a playwright, author (at Farrar &amp; Rinehart), a literary critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and an original stockholder and board member).

== Merger ==
In 1953, Pellegrini &amp; Cudahy merged with Farrar, Straus &amp; Young.

Robert Giroux joined the company in 1955, and after he later became a partner, the name was changed to Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Giroux had been working for Harcourt and had been angered when Harcourt refused to allow him to publish Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Giroux brought many literary authors with him including Thomas Merton, John Berryman, Robert Lowell, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Jack Kerouac, Peter Taylor, Randall Jarrell, T.S. Eliot, and Bernard Malamud. Alan Williams described Giroux&#x27;s &quot;Pied Piper sweep&quot; as &quot;almost certainly the greatest number of authors to follow, on their own initiative, a single editor from house to house in the history of modern publishing.&quot; In 1964, Straus named Giroux chairman of the board and officially added Giroux&#x27;s name to the publishing company.

== Sale ==
Straus continued to run the company for twenty years after his partner Farrar died, until 1993 when he sold a majority interest of the company to the privately owned German publishing conglomerate Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group. Straus offered FSG to the Holtzbrinck family because of their reputation for publishing serious works of literature.

== 21st century ==
Jonathan Galassi served as both president and publisher until 2018. From 2004 to 2021, Andrew Mandel served as &quot;deputy publisher&quot;. In 2008, Mitzi Angel came from Fourth Estate in the UK to be publisher of the Faber and Faber Inc. imprint. In 2018, Angel succeeded Galassi as publisher, and was named president in 2021. Jenna Johnson was named vice president and editor in chief in December 2021, taking the baton from Eric Chinski who was named senior executive editor after 15 years as editor in chief. Other notable editors include Sean McDonald and Alex Star.

In February 2015, FSG and Faber and Faber announced the end of their partnership. All books scheduled for release and previously released under the imprint were moved to the FSG colophon by August 2016.

<doc id="702446" wikidata="Q7728017" url="?curid=702446" title="The Cremation of Sam McGee">
<text>&quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot; is among the most famous of Robert W. Service&#x27;s poems. It was published in 1907 in &quot;Songs of a Sourdough&quot;. (A &quot;sourdough&quot;, in this sense, is a resident of the Yukon.) It concerns the cremation of a prospector who freezes to death near Lake Laberge (spelled &quot;Lebarge&quot; by Service), Yukon, Canada, as told by the man who cremates him.

==Poem==
Sam McGee has left his (fictional) hometown of Plumtree, Tennessee, to seek gold in the Yukon. While travelling the Dawson Trail with Cap, the narrator, Sam becomes convinced that he will die of exposure to the cold and asks Cap to cremate his body. Cap agrees to the request; Sam dies the next day, leaving Cap to haul the body along the trail in search of an opportunity to cremate it. Upon reaching the &quot;marge [shore, edge] of Lake Lebarge&quot;, he finds a derelict steamer frozen in the ice and decides to make use of it. Once Cap has lit and fuelled the boiler furnace, he stuffs in Sam&#x27;s body and walks away as it burns. He returns some time later and, upon opening the furnace door, is stunned to see Sam smiling contentedly and asking him to close it so the heat will not escape.

Robert Service based the poem on an experience of his roommate, Dr. Leonard S. E. Sugden, who had cremated a corpse in the firebox of the steamer &quot;Olive May&quot;.

A success upon its initial publication in 1907, the poem became a staple of traditional campfire storytelling in North America throughout the 20th century. An edition of the poem, published in 1986 and illustrated by Ted Harrison, is read widely in Canadian elementary schools.

==Background==

Although the poem was fiction, it was based on people and things that Robert Service actually saw in the Yukon. Lake Laberge is formed by a widening of the Yukon River just north of Whitehorse and is still in use by kayakers. The &quot;Alice May&quot; was based on the derelict stern-wheeler the &quot;Olive May&quot; that belonged to the Bennett Lake &amp; Klondike Navigation Co. and had originally been named for the wife and daughter of Albert Sperry Kerry Sr. It was abandoned after it struck a rock near Tagish, which is about south of Lake Laberge. Dr. Sugden used its firebox to cremate the body of Cornelius Curtin (who had died of pneumonia). (Although a boat named &quot;Alice May&quot; sank on Lake Laberge, that happened a decade after the publication of the poem.)

William Samuel McGee was primarily a road builder but did indulge in some prospecting. Like others, McGee was in San Francisco, California, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush and in 1898 left for the Klondike.

In 1904, Service, who was working in the Canadian Bank of Commerce (the predecessor of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) branch in Whitehorse, saw McGee&#x27;s name on a form and used it in his poem as it was a rhyme for &quot;Tennessee&quot;.

In 1909, McGee travelled south of the Yukon to build roads, including some in Yellowstone National Park. Eventually, McGee and his wife moved to live with their daughter outside of Beiseker, Alberta. However, in 1930, McGee returned to the Yukon to try prospecting along the Liard River, but met with no success. He did however return with an urn that he had purchased in Whitehorse. The urns, said to contain the ashes of Sam McGee, were being sold to visitors.

McGee spent the rest of his life at his daughter&#x27;s farm, where he died in 1940 of a heart attack, and is buried near Beiseker.

==Legacy==
On 17 August 1976, Canada Post issued &quot;Robert W. Service, Sam McGee&quot; as an 8¢ stamp designed by David Charles Bierk.

Johnny Cash&#x27;s reading of the poem was National Public Radio&#x27;s song of the day on May 9, 2006. Cash&#x27;s &quot;The Cremation of Sam McGee&quot; was released along with a vast collection of personal archive recordings of Johnny Cash on the two-disc album &quot;Personal File.&quot;

Canadian folksinger/songwriter Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors created an uptempo song summarizing the tale in the early 1970s on his album &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom Meets Big Joe Mufferaw&quot;.

In 2022, musician Seth Boyer adapted the poem into a bluegrass song for use in the video essay &quot;Fear of Cold&quot; by Jacob Geller.

<doc id="702455" wikidata="Q7089400" url="?curid=702455" title="Omaha (horse)">
<text>Omaha (March 24, 1932 – April 24, 1959) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the third winner of the American Triple Crown.

In a racing career which lasted from 1934 to 1936, Omaha won 9 of his 22 races. He had his greatest success as a three-year-old in 1935 when he swept the Triple Crown. As a four-year-old, he narrowly lost the Ascot Gold Cup.

==Background==
Foaled at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, Omaha was a chestnut horse with a white blaze who stood 16.3 hands high. He was the son of 1930 U.S. Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox and the mare Flambino. Omaha was the third horse to ever win the Triple Crown, which he did in 1935. Flambino also produced the Ascot Gold Cup winner Flares and was the sister of La France, the direct female ancestor of many notable thoroughbreds including Danzig Connection, Decidedly, and Johnstown.

The horse was owned by and bred William Woodward Sr.&#x27;s famous Belair Stud in Bowie, Maryland. He was trained by Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons, who also trained Omaha&#x27;s sire to the Triple Crown. As a yearling, Omaha was leggy and awkward-looking but a favorite of Woodward, who reportedly considered sending the horse to England to be trained for the Epsom Derby. In the event, Omaha&#x27;s move to England was postponed until 1936. He was ridden to his biggest wins by Canadian jockey Smokey Saunders.

==Racing career==

===1934: two-year-old season===
In his two-year-old season, Omaha finished second in a maiden race on June 18, 1934, and then won a similar event five days later. He failed to win in his remaining seven starts that year, although he ran well in several important races. He finished fourth to Balladier in the United States Hotel Stakes and fourth behind Boxthorn in the Saratoga Special Stakes. On August 22, Omaha finished second to Psychic Bid in the Sanford Stakes and was later third to the same horse in the Hopeful Stakes.

In the Champagne Stakes on September 6, Omaha finished second by a neck to Balladier, who set a track record of 1:16.6 for the six and a half furlong race. Ten days later, Omaha contested the season&#x27;s most valuable race, the Futurity at Belmont Park, in which he ran fourth behind Chance Sun. On his final appearance of the season, he finished second in the Junior Champion Stakes over one mile, beaten a nose by Sailor Beware in a race-record time of 1:36.6.

===1935: three-year-old season===
Omaha began his three-year-old season by winning an allowance race at Aqueduct Race Track. In the Wood Memorial Stakes, he ran third to Today and Plat Eye after finishing &quot;like a runaway train&quot;.

Omaha started second favorite for the Kentucky Derby, with his supporters including Damon Runyon, who tipped the colt despite describing him as &quot;a big, leggy, green thing that seems to invariably get into a lot of trouble&quot;. Despite cold weather and heavy rain, the race attracted a crowd of 50,000 to Churchill Downs, and the filly Nellie Flag was made favorite. Saunders kept Omaha clear of early trouble before moving the colt into the lead in the backstretch. Omaha was never seriously challenged and won by a length and a half from Roman Soldier without Saunders ever using his whip. Whiskolo finished third ahead of Nellie Flag and Blackbirder.

A week after his Derby win, Omaha was made odds-on favorite for the Preakness Stakes in front of a record crowd of 40,000 at Pimlico Race Course. He caught the front-running Brannon on the turn out of the backstretch and drew clear to win by six lengths from Firethorn, with Psychic Bid a further six lengths back in third. Omaha refused to stand still for the post-race ceremonies, meaning that Saunders had to collect the presentational rose wreath &quot;on the fly&quot;.

The colt was brought back in distance for the Withers Stakes over one mile on May 27. He was made 1/2 favorite, but despite finishing strongly he failed to catch Rosemont and was beaten by one and a half lengths. In the Belmont Stakes over one and a half miles on June 8, Omaha started 7/10 favorite over Rosemont and Firethorn. Racing on a sloppy track, he was towards the rear in the early stages and entered the stretch covered in mud. He then produced &quot;one of his famous stretch drives&quot; to win by a length and a half from Firethorn, with a further eight lengths back to Rosemont in third.

Two weeks after his Belmont Stakes win, Omaha took on older horses for the first time in the Brooklyn Handicap. He was no match for the four-year-old Discovery, who won by six lengths from King Saxon in record time of 1:48.2 for nine furlongs. Omaha was a further four lengths back in third. A week later, he returned to his own age group for the Dwyer Stakes. Ridden by Wayne Wright, he defeated the CCA Oaks winner Good Gamble by one and a half lengths. On July 21, Omaha started 2/5 favorite for the Arlington Classic in front of a crowd of 40,000 in Chicago. He took his winnings for the season to $142,225 by winning in track record time from St Bernard, Bloodroot, and Black Helen. He was reported to be lame in August and missed the rest of the season, although the exact nature of his injury was never fully explained.

There were no formal &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; awards in 1935, but Omaha was recognised as the champion three-year-old colt in the United States. Discovery, however, was regarded as the year&#x27;s outstanding horse.

===1936: four-year-old season===
In January 1936, Omaha was moved to Aqueduct racecourse, where he was exercised under the supervision of British trainer Cecil Boyd-Rochfort. He was then loaded aboard the and shipped to England to enter Boyd-Rochfort&#x27;s Newmarket stable. His principal objective was the Ascot Gold Cup, which no American horse had won since Foxhall&#x27;s triumph in 1882.

On May 9, he made his British debut in the Victor Wild Stakes over one and a half miles at Kempton Park Racecourse, where he was ridden by his new jockey, Pat Beasley. Racing on turf and on a right-handed track for the first time, Omaha accelerated past his opponents half a mile from the finish and won &quot;impressively&quot; by one and a half lengths from Montrose. Four weeks later, he returned to the same course for the Queen&#x27;s Plate over two miles. He took the lead in the straight and won from Lord Derby&#x27;s colt Bobsleigh in what was described as a &quot;thrilling&quot; finish.

At Royal Ascot on June 18, Omaha contested the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup. He started favorite at odds of 11/8 against eight opponents, with his biggest danger appearing to be Quashed, a non-Thoroughbred filly who had won The Oaks in 1935. Before the race, which attracted a crowd estimated at 150,000, Omaha appeared agitated and almost unseated Beasley on several occasions. He was restrained by Beasley in the early stages before moving up to challenge Quashed for the lead just before the right-hand turn into the straight. The filly and the colt raced together throughout the closing stages, drawing well clear of the remaining runners. A furlong from the finish, Omaha drew level and looked the likely winner, but Quashed rallied in the final strides and was awarded the victory by a short head. Many years later, the 1936 Gold Cup was described by &quot;The Observer&quot; as the greatest race of all time. In his only subsequent race in England, Omaha ran second by a neck to Taj Akbar in the one and a half mile Princess of Wales&#x27;s Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July. In this race, Omaha carried 138 pounds, eighteen pounds more than the winner, a three-year-old who had finished second to Mahmoud in The Derby.

Omaha remained in training with Boyd-Rochfort and was aimed at the 1937 Ascot Gold Cup. He was found to be lame shortly before the race and never ran again.

== Race record ==
==Stud career==

Retired to stand at stud at Claiborne Farm, he failed to perform satisfactorily and in 1943 was turned over to the Jockey Club&#x27;s Breeding Bureau, which sent him north to a stud farm in New York State where he remained for seven years. He was then moved west in 1950 to Nebraska, where he lived out the last nine years of his life on a farm near Nebraska City, about 45 miles (72 km) south of the city of Omaha. During the 1950s, the Triple Crown winner was taken to the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack in Omaha, where he appeared in the winner&#x27;s circle.

When Omaha died in 1959 at the age of 27, he was buried at the Ak-Sar-Ben Racetrack.

Omaha was not considered a successful sire with the best of his progeny being the Bing Crosby Handicap winner Prevaricator and the Louisiana Handicap winner South Dakota. His more remote descendants included Nijinsky II and three Kentucky Derby winners.

In 1965, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; ranking of the top 100 thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Omaha was ranked #61.

<text>A pyre (; ), also known as a funeral pyre, is a structure, usually made of wood, for burning a body as part of a funeral rite or execution. As a form of cremation, a body is placed upon or under the pyre, which is then set on fire.

In discussing ancient Greek religion, &quot;pyre&quot; (the normal Greek word for fire anglicized) is also used for the sacred fires at altars, on which parts of the animal sacrifice were burnt as an offering to the deity.

== Materials ==
Pyres are crafted using wood. The composition of a pyre may be determined through use of charcoal analysis. Charcoal analysis helps to predict composition of the fuel and local forestry of the charcoal being studied.

=== Ireland ===

Specifically, in the Bronze Age, pyre materials were gathered based on local abundance and ease of access to the wood although materials were also selected due to the specific properties, potential traditional purpose, or due to economical reasons. In Templenoe, pyres typically consisted of oak and fruit wood compositions.

=== Poland ===

From analyzing three necropolises, in Kokotów, Pawłowice and Korytnica, it seems that Polish pyres consisted of primarily Scots pine, birch, and oak trees, as pines, birch, and oak were dense in local woodlands. All parts of the tree were used including the trunk, branches, twigs, and even pine cones.

During World War II, pyres were used in German death camps on Polish territory, such as Treblinka.

=== Pyre remains in Britain ===
Worked antler and bone objects, along with flint and flake tools, and copper-alloys are most commonly found in pyre cremation remains. The copper-alloys leave a blue-green stain and are typically fused to the ribs, arms, and other areas where jewelry is commonly worn.

==== Analysis of bone fragment size ====
A study was done on the bone fragments of cremations to show that not only will movement of the bone fragments cause breakage but also environmental factors play a part. After studying cremation remains in urns that had been tightly sealed and had no evidence of environmental disturbance it was found that on average bigger bone fragment sizes were observed meaning less bone breakage had occurred. It was concluded that if cremated bone is placed in an urn before burial the original bone fragment size will be preserved. This study was intended to explain that more cautionary measures should be taken during and after any cremation occurs and to educate those who are studying cremated bone that the size of the fragments will be smaller than there were right after cremation.

==Uses==
Traditionally, pyres are used for the cremation of the dead in the Hindu and Sikh religions, a practice which dates back several thousands of years. Funeral pyres were also used in Germanic and Roman culture.

===Secular===
Pyres and bonfires are used in celebrations and remembrance in services. Examples of these are Guy Fawkes Night in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, where the &#x27;Guy&#x27;, either seen as an effigy of Guy Fawkes or the Pope, is burned.

Funeral pyres were used by the Nazis to cremate the bodies of 1,500,000+ prisoners in Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka extermination camps, in contrast to the crematoria used in other camps. Pyres have also been used to dispose of large quantities of livestock in agriculture, particularly those infected with disease.

Pyres are lit around the clock in Varanasi, India as it is considered one of the oldest standing cities. Hindu&#x27;s believe that by resting the ashes of the dead in the Ganges river in at Varanasi, the dead will achieve Moksha. Hindus will travel great lengths in order to perform ritualistic duties such as praying, attending to their dead, or to die.

=== Sati practice in Nepal &amp; India ===
Some Hindu groups practiced Sati (also known as suttee). Sati is the act of volunteered self immolation of a widow of the deceased husband with his corpse or remains. This involves volunteering oneself (and generally being in state of samadhi) to be burnt alive on the pyre with the remains of her husband for higher state of life.

==Environmental impacts of pyres==
===Environmental impact in Southern Asia===
Chakrabarty RK, et al. examined the environmental effects of Southern Asia&#x27;s funeral pyres in their study, &quot;Funeral pyres in South Asia: Brown carbon aerosol emissions and climate impacts&quot;. The heating of the atmosphere from carbonaceous aerosols resulting from human activities is a significant contributor to climate change in South Asia. In this region, fossil fuel use and residential biofuels have been documented to be the primary emitter of light-absorbing black carbon aerosols. The study determined the emitted organic carbon contributed 40% to smoke absorption of visible solar radiation, about 92 Gg annually.

A second study examined the carbonaceous fractions associated with indoor PM2.5/PM10 during Asian cultural and ritual burning practices. (Dewangan, et al.) This study concluded drastically higher levels of biomass burning markers within burial rituals performed indoors compared to levels collected for residential indoors and ambient outdoors, with levels reaching three- to eightfold higher levels of carbonaceous aerosols. These high chemical levels were also found to correlate to higher aerosol fraction levels during winter months in both Muslim Holy Shrines and marriage places. The study concluded PM concentrations were significantly higher in indoor-ritual locations and suggested further studies and actions be taken to investigate risk and health assessment and calls for regulatory agencies to propose new guidelines for indoor cultural/ritual locations.

===Environmental impacts in India===

A traditional Hindu funeral pyre takes six hours and burns 500–600 kg (1,102–1,323 pounds) of wood to burn a body completely. Every year fifty to sixty million trees are burned during cremations in India, which results in about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution, deforestation and large quantities of ash, which are later thrown into rivers, adding to the toxicity of its waters, pose great environmental problems.

The Green Revolution Foundation, under its parent organization Sarthak Charitable Trust, is a Delhi-based NGO working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres. They claim to have created an alternative to wood-based funeral pyres, which reduces the number of trees which need to be cut down. Their alternative also promotes the Swachh Bharat Mission. As a result, the cost is reduced significantly and emissions are cut by up to 60%.

==Legality of open-air pyres==
In ancient times burning bodies was a practiced form of burial. Open-air cremations, known as funeral pyres, are uncommon and even illegal in some countries, particularly in the Western World, because it is considered taboo. While cremation is commonplace, open air cremations in the United Kingdom were considered to be unlawful under the Cremation Act 1902. The law was created to prevent the creation of a private cremation industry and because of issues concerning property. But at the time environmental concerns did not play any factor in the creation of the law.

In February 2010, a Hindu man named Davender Ghai was granted permission to be cremated on a traditional open-air pyre, when a court of appeals in the United Kingdom ruled them legal inside of a building with an open roof and away from roads or homes. In the U.S., a group in Crestone, Colorado, a part of the Crestone End of Life Project, obtained legal permission to perform &quot;open-air cremations&quot;. Others have attempted to open up more outdoor funeral pyres but have faced disapproval. Crestone, Colorado is the only place where open-air cremations are legal in the United States. They can perform around 12 a year, regardless of religion and families can be involved in the process if they would like. At this time, the group only allows people who are part of the local community to choose this alternative burial.

== Roman pyres ==
In the time leading up to the 2nd century AD popular funeral practices in Rome consisted of cremation with a pyre. Ideal funeral practices meant burning an ornamental pyre for the deceased, that would burn with enough heat and a long enough time to only leave ashes and small bone fragments. Having to use another&#x27;s pyre was a sign of poverty or emergency cases.

The process of constructing and properly burning a funeral pyre is a skilled task. Often, pyres would not burn with enough heat to properly cremate human remains. Pyres had to be maintained by stoking the flame and raking the pyre to allow good oxygen flow. Ancient literature refers to the skilled job of an ustor, meaning a professional pyre builder derived from the Latin word &#x27;ūrere&#x27; which means, to burn. However, regardless of professional build, pyres were unpredictable and would go wrong on a regular basis. The Elder Pliny writes of extreme cases in which bodies have been thrown from the pyre from the force of the flames. Other cases, described by Plutarch, involving deceased victims of poisoning, resulted in the human body bursting open and dousing the pyre.

== Forensic evaluation of pyres ==
A study conducted by Alunni, et al. examined the forensic science behind cremations on wooden pyres. The study concluded the average pyre does not completely destroy a human body effectively, and differences in suicide via pyres are evident in the remains. A pyre suicide shows signs of remains being more charred rather than completely oxidized by high temperatures, are in anatomically correct positions, poor bone fragmentation, and is without suspicious burn patterns compared to an individual murdered via pyre. Cremated remains are different from traditional human remains in the sense that their physical appearance including bone vary in color, fragmentation, and differ from their original shape and dimension. This is why forensic experimental studies are necessary to fully understand the differences the body undergoes in a pyre. Coloring of bones before cremation is dependent on oxygen exposure, duration, and temperature. The bone color can range from black to brown or an oxidized white color. The type of bone and method of cooling may also alter the bone form. Cooling is also an important consideration, for if the remains are cooled via water it increases warping. This knowledge is a consideration for archaeologists to understand the remains from pyres.

<text>The Second Amendment of the Constitution Act 1941 (previously bill no. 40 of 1941) is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland that was in the form of omnibus legislation affecting a variety of articles on a range of subject matters. It was signed into law on 30 May 1941.

==Background==
The constitution came into force on 29 December 1937, and Douglas Hyde, the first president, took office on 25 June 1938. While the constitution mandated that amendments to it would usually require a referendum, its transitory provisions provided that for the first three years after the first president took office, amendment would be by ordinary act of the Oireachtas (parliament). The intention was that teething troubles and inconveniences which early experience of the new constitution might uncover could be fixed conveniently without the expense of a referendum. In January 1938, the Department of the Taoiseach established a file for proposed amendments, with a view to enacting a single omnibus bill prior to the expiry of the three-year transition period on 25 June 1941. The First Amendment was prepared separately after the Munich Crisis and rushed through the Oireachtas at the outbreak of the Second World War, to allow the Emergency Powers Act 1939 to operate for the duration of &quot;The Emergency&quot;.

Amendments suggested by various Departments of State were added to the Department of the Taoiseach&#x27;s omnibus file. In April 1940, Éamon de Valera, the Taoiseach, established a committee to review the file and make suggestions, chaired by Maurice Moynihan with members from the Attorney General&#x27;s office, the Department of External Affairs and the parliamentary draftsman&#x27;s office. The committee met in May and June and in September delivered its report, which was circulated to departments for comment. An initial draft of the amendment bill was made in November 1940, and given a first reading in the Dáil (lower house) 27 November 1940. It was debated and amended by the Dáil and Seanad (upper house) in April and May 1941, and signed into law by President Hyde on 30 May 1941.

The most important changes introduced by the amendment included restrictions on the right to , an extension of the right of the government to declare a state of emergency, changes to provisions on the reference of bills to the Supreme Court by the President, and various changes that were needed to bring the official Irish text of the constitution into line with the English text. An unusual aspect of the Second Amendment was that it introduced a change to Article 56 of the transitory provisions even though that article was no longer a part of the official published text of the constitution.

==Overview of changes==
The Second Amendment made the following alterations to the constitution:

===Reference of bills to the Supreme Court===
Altered Article 26, which deals with the referral by the president of a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. Most importantly, the amendment introduced a requirement that when ruling on a bill referred to it by the president under his reserve powers, the Supreme Court can issue only one opinion, and no dissenting opinions are permitted. That was in keeping with the practice in many civil law supreme courts and was intended to promote legal certainty. However, the provision that was added by Article 26 applies only for presidential references of bills, and the Supreme Court may still issue dissenting opinions in all other circumstances. A further alteration to Article 34 provided that a law that has survived a reference to the Supreme Court can never again have its constitutionality challenged.
Altered Article 40, dealing with . Before the Second Amendment, detained individuals had the constitutional right to apply to any High Court judge for a writ of and to as many High Court judges as they wished. Since the Second Amendment, prisoners have a right to apply to only one judge, and once a writ had been issued, the President of the High Court has the authority to choose the judge or a panel of three judges to decide the case. The amendment also added that when the High Court believes someone&#x27;s detention to be invalid because of the unconstitutionality of a law, it must refer the matter to the Supreme Court and may release the individual only on bail in the interim. Another new provision gave the High Court authority to defer a death sentence while it was considering a writ of . The provision became defunct with the 1990 abolition of Capital punishment in Ireland, and was removed by the Twenty-first Amendment in 2002.

===National emergency===
Altered Article 28 so that an officially-declared &quot;time of war or armed rebellion&quot; could be ended only by a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas. The emergency declared at the outbreak of the Second World War was not declared to end until 1976, although the Emergency Powers Act 1939 lapsed in 1946.

===Irish text===
Made seven changes to the Irish text to align better with the (unchanged) English text. The Clerk of the Dáil, Department of Finance, and Gaeltacht Services section of the Department of Lands had supplied long lists of proposed changes to the Irish text, for clarity or to make the grammar, spelling, and technical vocabulary more consistent within the document and with earlier acts of the Free State Oireachtas. Maurice Moynihan and the Oireachtas translation section rejected almost all of these, adopting the conservative policy of making changes only where a clear inconsistency needed to be resolved. A few such were cases where the English text was amended during the 1937 Dáil debates and the Irish text had not been updated to match. Another was the First Amendment of the Constitution, rushed through at the start of the war, which had amended only the English text. The Second Amendment also added a provision that, in the event of inconsistency between the English and Irish texts, the Irish text would take precedence.

===Presidential vacancies===
Altered Article 12.3.3°, which provides that in the event of the death, resignation or permanent incapacity of the president, a presidential election must occur within 60 days. The phrase &quot;(whether occurring before or after he enters upon his office)&quot; was added to clarify that the requirement would apply even if the president-elect had not yet assumed office. The Second Amendment also introduced to Article 14, which deals with the temporary exercise of the powers of the president by the Presidential Commission or the Council of State, a slight change to the wording to clarify that the organs may exercise not only the president&#x27;s constitutional duties but also any additional duties that are conferred upon the president by law.

===Seanad===
Altered Article 18 to clarify that the Taoiseach who nominates senators after a Dáil general election must be nominated by the new Dáil and not an outgoing caretaker Taoiseach. An alteration was also made to the text of Article 24.2, which deals with the procedure if the time for the consideration of a bill in the Senate has been abridged.

===Promulgation of laws===
Introduced minor changes to Article 25, altering the precise procedure to be used in the signing, promulgation and enrolment of acts of the Oireachtas. It also added a new provision allowing the Taoiseach to enrol an updated version of the constitution with the registrar of the Supreme Court.

===Reference of bills to the people===
Introduced minor changes to the procedure for the reference of bills to the people under the reserve powers of the president. For example, it provided that the signatures on a petition to the president for a referendum must be verified in accordance to the law.

=== court hearings===
Altered Article 34 to provide that in &quot;special and limited cases&quot;, a court may administer justice .

===Transitory provisions===
Altered Article 56 to clarify the protections given to employees who had begun working for the government before the constitution was enacted. The change was unusual because by 1941, most of the transitory provisions, including Article 56, had been removed from all official published texts of the constitution. The provisions required their own omission on the grounds that they would no longer be relevant. However, most of the transitory provisions continued to have force of law and so could still be changed by a constitutional amendment.

<text>Giorgos Kalafatis (; 17 March 1890 – 19 February 1964) was a Greek football pioneer, player, coach, track and field athlete and the founder of Panathinaikos Athens multi-sports club.

==Sports career==
Being a big athletic talent, he distinguished himself in track and field sports. But football was his big passion. He played for Ethnikos G.S. Athens and when his later club Panellinios decided to discontinue its football team, Kalafatis together with 40 other athletes broke away and established in February 1908 the first team of Panathinaikos, named Podosfairikos Omilos Athinon (&quot;Football Club of Athens&quot;). Kalafatis appointed the Englishman John Cyril Campbell as coach for the new team. It was the first time that a foreigner was appointed as the coach of a Greek team.

Apart from Giorgos Kalafatis, other establishing members of POA were: his brother Alexandros, who was the first president, Emmanouel Chrysis, Dimitris Doukakis, Periklis Mpoumpoulis, Vasileios Granitsas, Mantzakos, Papageorgiou, Gaetas, Demertzis, Stavropoulos, Paschos, Misakian, Reppas, Sapounias and Garoufalias.

In 1919, he was a member of the Greece national team for the Inter-Allied Games in Paris. In Paris, Kalafatis collected information about basketball and volleyball (sports unknown then in Greece) and after his return to Athens, started his efforts on creating new teams with Panathinaikos. He was a player/manager in the Greece national team for the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp. His older brother, Alexandros, was selected for the unofficial Greece national team that played in the 1906 Summer Olympics in Athens, starting in both games which ended in 1–5 and 0–9 losses.

Kalafatis played football until the early 1920s. After he retired, he remained in Panathinaikos as an official.

==Personal life==
He was born in Exarcheia, Athens, which was a few hundred meters away from Leoforos Alexandras Stadium. The family of Kalafatis was from Dilinata, a village in the island of Cephalonia. While being an athlete, he graduated also from the Health Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He pursued a career in the Hellenic Navy, taking part in the Balkan Wars and in World War I and reaching up to the rank of rear admiral.

He died on 19 February 1964.

<text>The silver gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae) is a gull in Oceania. It is the most common gull of Australia. It has been found throughout the continent, but particularly at or near coastal areas. It is smaller than the Pacific gull (&quot;Larus pacificus&quot;), which also lives in Australia.

The silver gull should not be confused with the herring gull, which is called &quot;silver gull&quot; in many other languages (scientific name &quot;Larus argentatus&quot;, German &quot;Silbermöwe&quot;, French &quot;Goéland argenté&quot;, Dutch &quot;zilvermeeuw&quot;), but is a much larger, robust gull with no overlap in range.

==Taxonomy==
It has traditionally been placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;, as is the case with many gulls, but is now placed in the genus &quot;Chroicocephalus&quot;. Hartlaub&#x27;s gull (&quot;C. hartlaubii&quot;) of South Africa was formerly sometimes considered to be subspecies of the silver gull.

There are three subspecies:
* &quot;C. n. forsteri&quot; (Mathews, 1912) – north and northeast Australia, New Caledonia, Loyalty Islands 
* &quot;C. n. novaehollandiae&quot; (Stephens, 1826) – southern Australia and Tasmania
* &quot;C. n. scopulinus&quot; (Forster, JR, 1844) or red-billed gull – New Zealand

==Description==
=== Adult ===
The head, body, and tail of an adult silver gull are white, and the wings are light grey with white-spotted, black tips. Adults range from 40–45cm (15-17 Inches) in length. Their wingspan ranges from 271 to 314mm (10-12 Inches). Adults have bright red beaks which gets brighter during breeding or when they get older.

=== Juvenile ===
Juveniles have brown patterns on their wings, and a dark beak.

==Distribution and habitat==
Silver gulls are found in all states of Australia, as well as New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is a common species near human habitations and beaches, having adapted well to urban environments and thriving around shopping centres and garbage dumps. Their successful adaption to urban habitats have seen their population increase in areas of human activity, with the availability of nesting grounds the only limiting factor on population growth.

Silver gulls have twice been recorded in the United States; one bird was shot in August 1947 at the mouth of the Genesee River, Lake Ontario, and another was photographed in Salem County, New Jersey, in autumn 1996. Both are believed to have escaped from captivity.

==Behaviour==
The silver gull has a sharp voice consisting of a variety of calls. The most common call is a harsh, high pitched &#x27;kwarwh&#x27;.

===Feeding===
The silver gull naturally feeds on worms, fish, insects and crustaceans. It is a successful scavenger, allowing increased numbers near human settlements. It is known to pester humans for scraps and steal unattended food.

===Breeding===
Breeding occurs from August to December, typically in large colonies on offshore islands. The nest is located on the ground and consists of seaweed, roots, and plant stems. The nests may be found in low shrubs, rocks and jetties. Typical clutch size is one to three eggs. Often two broods are raised in a year, and both adults share nest-building, incubation and feeding.

<text>Tumescence is the quality or state of being tumescent or swollen. Tumescence usually refers to the normal engorgement with blood (vascular congestion) of the erectile tissues, marking sexual excitation, and possible readiness for sexual activity. The tumescent sexual organ in males is the penis and in females is the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia like the vestibular bulbs. Arteries in the penis dilate to increase blood volume.

Detumescence is the reversal of this process, by which blood leaves the erectile tissue, returning the erectile tissue to the flaccid state. 

Something that causes an erection is sometimes referred to as a tumefier (tumefyer) or tumescer.

<doc id="702505" wikidata="Q6818183" url="?curid=702505" title="Mercedes College (Adelaide)">
<text>Mercedes College is an independent Roman Catholic co-educational primary and High day school located in the Adelaide inner-south suburb of Springfield, South Australia, Australia.

Established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1954 as a boarding school for girls, it is now a co-educational day school. Mercedes is an International Baccalaureate (IB) school, and offers the PYP, MYP, and IB Diploma programmes as well as the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE).

== History ==

The school was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1954. The purchase of the site at Springfield brought to fruition the dream of finding a healthier environment for the girls&#x27; boarding school until that time part of Saint Aloysius College in Angas Street, Adelaide. With the eighty boarders on opening day were sixty day scholars, mostly girls but with a group of boys in the infant section.

After twenty-one years the boarding school was phased out when rising costs and a decline in the rural economy made it financially beyond the means of the very families it was created to serve. In 1976 the school became co-educational with the first intake of boys in the Year 8 and numbers have grown. The Mercedes property was originally part of the Springfield Estate. It was sold to Sir John Duncan, (father of Sir Walter, Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives for many years) who planned the house in 1891 and built it in 1899. The family home was named &quot;Strathspey&quot; after his childhood home in Scotland.

The Duncans eventually bequeathed the property to the Presbyterian Church and it became St Andrew&#x27;s Residential College attached the University of Adelaide. In 1939 the property was sold to Mr and Mrs F. W. Cornell and it once again became a private residence.

Archbishop Reynolds, first Archbishop of Adelaide, was in Dublin in 1879 asking for sisters of his diocese when a group of sisters returned from Buenos Aires, forced by revolution to leave their home for twenty-four years. Some were the original Irish sisters but many were South American girls who left behind their families and homes. Accepting the Archbishop&#x27;s invitation the twenty-four sisters arrived in Adelaide on 3 May 1880.

In 1953 the property was bought by the Sisters of Mercy, and approved by Xavier Dalton. &quot;Mercedes&quot;, the Spanish word for mercy, was chosen by the sisters to commemorate the circumstances of the Mercy foundation in Adelaide.

==Student life==
Many of the students who study at Mercedes College live in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide and Adelaide Hills, because of the easy access by public transport. Mercedes College uses the Adelaide Metro bus service to transport nearby students.

== House system ==
As with most Australian schools, Mercedes College utilises a house system. At first there were two houses (McAuley and Fitzpatrick), but as enrolment numbers increased, two more houses were added. There are currently four houses, each named after memorable Mercy Sisters. The current houses are McAuley, Fitzpatrick, Dalton and Barry.

<doc id="702506" wikidata="Q1472274" url="?curid=702506" title="White Palace (film)">
<text>White Palace is a 1990 American erotic romantic drama film directed by Luis Mandoki. It stars Susan Sarandon, James Spader, Jason Alexander, Kathy Bates, Steven Hill, Jeremy Piven, and Renée Taylor. It was written by Ted Tally and Alvin Sargent, based on the novel of the same name by Glenn Savan (who appears in the film as an extra with a small speaking part).

It centers on the unlikely relationship between a young upper middle class widower (Spader) who falls in love with a middle-aged working class waitress (Sarandon) in St. Louis, Missouri. The original music score was composed by George Fenton. The film is marketed with the tagline &quot;The story of a younger man and a bolder woman&quot;.

== Plot ==
Twenty-seven-year-old St. Louis advertising executive Max Baron has shut himself off from the world in the two years since the auto accident that killed his wife Janey. En route to his friend Neil&#x27;s bachelor party, Max picks up fifty burgers from a diner called White Palace. At the party, he discovers that the order is six burgers short and, to the ridicule of his friends, returns to the restaurant to complain.

At the White Palace diner, after a dispute occurs between Max and a forty-three-year-old waitress, Nora Baker, she refunds him. Max returns to the party but leaves upset, heads to a bar and runs into Nora. Drunk, she flirts with him, but he pushes her advances away and starts to leave. She senses that he is upset, asks why, and discovers his wife&#x27;s death. She discloses that her young son died of leukemia. The &#x27;connection&#x27; prevents him from leaving. They have some drinks and eventually he gives her a lift home to the Dogtown neighborhood in St. Louis, but drunkenly crashes his car into her mailbox. She invites him to spend the night at her house, with the couch as his bed. Max starts dreaming about his late wife, then wakes up to find Nora performing fellatio on him. They end up having passionate sex.

After visiting Janey&#x27;s grave on the second anniversary of her death, Max returns to White Palace to watch a busy Nora from a distance. He visits her at home with the pretext of replacing the broken mailbox, but instead they begin a relationship. Max becomes more relaxed and cheerful around Nora and at his work, but remains reluctant to reveal their relationship to his family and friends. He eventually gets frustrated that all he and Nora do is sit and watch TV in her house. She reminds him of their differences in age and social backgrounds.

Nora is angry after Max lied to her about his friend Neil&#x27;s wedding and that he did not take her. They argue about how Max keeps their relationship a secret and that he is probably ashamed of being seen with her. Nora&#x27;s sister, Judy, meets Max the following day and explains to him, in Nora&#x27;s absence, how they were abandoned as children and that she left a young Nora to fend for herself. Judy also explains that Nora&#x27;s son drowned.

While at the supermarket with Nora, Max leaves her at the counter and runs into Neil&#x27;s wife, Rachel, who invites him and his &quot;mystery woman&quot; to Thanksgiving. At Max&#x27;s apartment, Nora hears a message on his answering machine inviting them to the Horowitzes&#x27; home for Thanksgiving. Nora brings up the subject to a hesitant Max; however, they resolve to attend as a couple. At the Thanksgiving dinner with Neil, Rachel, Mrs. Baron, Max&#x27;s friends, and the Horowitz extended family make Nora uncomfortable. Following an argument between Nora and Neil&#x27;s father, she walks out, Max and his mother following. After the dinner, Nora and Max argue in her house over what happened, and she tells him to leave.

Max later finds Nora&#x27;s house empty and a note explaining to him that she left and that he should not come looking for her. He visits White Palace and is informed that Nora quit. He goes to a brunch with friends and meets Heidi Solomon, but cannot stop thinking about Nora. He then realizes that everyone around him seems stuck-up and obsessed with their &quot;perfect&quot; upper-middle class lives. He travels to New York to find Nora&#x27;s sister Judy, and is informed that Nora is waitressing in a restaurant. Max finds Nora there and confesses his love to her, revealing that he quit his job and moved to New York to be with her. They reunite, kissing as patrons of the restaurant look on. Max clears the table of its contents and lays a laughing Nora down on it, climbing on top of her and kissing her, while the whole restaurant cheers and applauds.

== Production ==
The original title for the film was to have been &quot;The White Castle&quot;, and the novel even makes reference to a specific real White Castle location at the intersection of S. Grand Blvd. and Gravois Ave. in south St. Louis, but the restaurant chain refused permission to use its trademarked name in either the novel or the film, and also refused permission to allow any of its restaurants for filming locations.
Instead, an independent diner at the intersection of North Eighteenth and Olive Streets just west of downtown St. Louis was used – and that address is even given in the film as a plug for the diner. After the film was released the diner&#x27;s owners sought permission to permanently rename it &quot;White Palace&quot;, but were refused by the studio, so the diner was instead renamed &quot;White Knight&quot;.
The movie also features and was shot almost entirely in the St. Louis area, one of the few major movie productions to be filmed and set there, including the Thanksgiving Dinner scenes, which were filmed in a private home off Conway Road located at #2 Frontenac Place in west St. Louis County, and Nora&#x27;s house, which was in the Dogtown neighborhood of the City of St. Louis northwest of the intersection of Hampton and Manchester Avenues at 1521 W. Billon Avenue.

The film also originally shot scenes which followed a subplot in the film, in which Max (James Spader) and his boss Rosemary (Kathy Bates) start working for a new client at their advertising agency. In the book, this woman is named Stephanie Deluc. Both Max and Rosemary have a difficult relationship with her throughout the novel, culminating in Max losing his temper with her later on and losing his job because of it. Gina Gershon was cast as Stephanie Deluc in the film, and shot many scenes, presumably following this subplot of the novel. However, for reasons unknown, the studio removed all the scenes, which meant that Gershon&#x27;s entire role ended up on the cutting room floor, and she no longer appears in the film. This also meant that Kathy Bates&#x27;s role of Rosemary, Max&#x27;s boss, was greatly reduced, now appearing very briefly in the finished film in a couple of scenes, in only one of which she has some dialogue.

In the January 1995 issue of Movieline magazine, Susan Sarandon revealed she was very nervous before doing the infamous oral sex scene with James Spader.

== Home media ==
&quot;White Palace&quot; was released on VHS on March 21, 1991 &amp; released on Laserdisc in 1993 by MCA/Universal Home Video. GoodTimes Entertainment released the film via DVD on May 1, 2001. The DVD was released on March 1, 2005, from Universal&#x27;s Studio Collections after the DVD release in UK. The Blu-ray was released on October 30, 2017, in United Kingdom (which was never released in United States) by Fabulous Films Limited.

== Reception ==
&quot;White Palace&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 50% approval rating based on 28 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10. 

Roger Ebert wrote that the film is at its best when exploring the two main leads&#x27; &quot;nonconforming relationship&quot; outside of their social circles and suffers when going through the &quot;same sappy romantic clichés as countless other love stories.&quot; He concluded: &quot;And yet there&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s good in &quot;White Palace,&quot; involving the heart as well as the mind.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;the film manages to avoid the more interesting problem area of what will happen to the couple once they decide to settle down and live openly together. Both principals, however, are good in their limited roles.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; grade, calling it &quot;yet another bogus movie about class differences&quot; that wants its audience to laugh at the characters&#x27; &quot;most superficial traits&quot;, but praised Spader and Sarandon for bringing &quot;a shaggy sense of fun&quot; to their roles, saying they &quot;make &quot;White Palace&quot; worth seeing, but too often they&#x27;re fighting the movie&#x27;s smugness.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the &quot;unconvincing&quot; production design of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and &quot;squalid&quot; sides of St. Louis and the &quot;badly cast&quot; supporting characters for diminishing the overall plot, but gave praise to Spader and Sarandon for elevating the &quot;many preconceptions and clichés&quot; throughout the material, highlighting the latter for giving &quot;a zesty, spirited, fully formed performance&quot;.

<text>Kaimū was a small town in the Puna District on Island of Hawaii that was completely destroyed by an eruptive flow of lava from the Kūpaʻianahā vent of the Kīlauea volcano in 1990. In Hawaiian, &quot;kai mū&quot; means &quot;gathering [at the] sea&quot; as to watch surfing. The lava flow that destroyed Kaimū and nearby Kalapana erupted from the southeast rift zone of Kīlauea.

==Before volcanic destruction==
Kaimū was located on Kaimū Bay. The bay was world-famous for its black sand beach which was surrounded by shady palm trees. Kaimū was the birthplace of Hawaiian nationalist leader Joseph Nāwahī.

==After volcanic destruction==
Now both the bay and the town are buried under some of lava. A large section of State Route 130 (Kaimu-Chain of Craters Road) was also covered by the lava. The road is on top of the cooled lava now, with some homes built on top of the lava. There is also the New Beach, black sand like the old, where locals and visitors are bringing sprouted coconuts and planting them to restore the lost trees.

<text>Waitakere City was a territorial authority in West Auckland, New Zealand; it was governed by the Waitakere City Council from 1989 to 2010. It was New Zealand&#x27;s fifth-largest city, with an annual growth of about 2%. In 2010 the council was amalgamated with the other authorities of the Auckland Region to form the current Auckland Council.

The name &quot;Waitakere&quot; comes from the Waitākere River in the Waitākere Ranges.

== History ==
Waitakere City was formed by the amalgamation of Waitemata City with the boroughs of Henderson, New Lynn, and Glen Eden in the 1989 nationwide re-organisation of local government. There were just two mayors of Waitakere City during its existence, Assid Corban (previously mayor of Henderson Borough) from 1989 to 1992, and Bob Harvey from 1992 to 2010.

In February 1993 the council developed the &quot;Greenprint&quot; as an Agenda 21 initiative and declared itself to be an eco-city.

On 1 November 2010, the Waitakere City Council was abolished and Waitakere City was merged into a single Auckland city governed by Auckland Council. All council facilities, assets and services were handed over to the new council.

==Administrative structure==
The elected Council consisted of the mayor and 14 councillors representing the four wards. Each ward also had an elected community board that considered local issues.

==Geography, wards and suburbs==
===Henderson Ward===
This urban ward contained the old Henderson borough as well as the suburbs of Glendene, Te Atatū South, and Te Atatū Peninsula (formerly Te Atatū North). There were 40,086 residents in 2001. It was located immediately to the west of Auckland city, some 10 kilometres from the city centre, along the western shores of the Waitematā Harbour and its southwestern arm, the Whau River.

===Massey Ward===
Although this area was principally urban, it also had some farms and lifestyle blocks in the north and west. The ward contained the suburbs of Whenuapai, Hobsonville, West Harbour, Massey, Ranui, and Henderson North. It had a population of 51,369 in the 2001 census. It was located to the north of the Henderson Ward, along the Waitemata&#x27;s northwestern shore, and included one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest concentrations of former military bases, with former large army and air force stations within the ward.

===New Lynn Ward===
Centred on the old boroughs of New Lynn and Glen Eden, it also contained the suburbs of Kelston, Green Bay, Titirangi, Kaurilands, Waima, and Woodlands Park. The ward had a population of 49,845 in 2001. New Lynn Ward was to the south of Henderson Ward, and extended to the shore of the Manukau Harbour at its southern end. New Lynn itself is 10 kilometres southwest of Auckland city centre.

===Waitakere Ward===
This ward was by far the largest in area as it encompassed the sparsely populated Waitākere Ranges, as well as some of the urban fringes as the city expanded westward into former orchards and farms. The population of 27,450 in 2001 was the smallest of the wards, but it was also the fastest growing. It encompassed the suburbs, villages and localities of Swanson, Henderson Valley, Sunnyvale, Oratia, Waiatarua, Laingholm, Parau, Cornwallis, Huia, Whatipu, Karekare, Piha, Anawhata, Bethells / Te Henga, and Waitakere township. Many of these had volunteer fire brigades to protect their communities from the summer bush fires. This ward lay to the west of the three other wards, and extended to the north as well. Its northern end, around Muriwai, was the furthest part of Waitakere from Auckland city centre, lying some 30 kilometres to the northwest of it.
==Mayors==

The mayor was directly elected across the whole city council area using a First Past the Post electoral system. Each electoral term was for three years. The final mayor was Bob Harvey.

===List of mayors of Waitakere City===

==Industry==
The two major commercial centres of Waitakere City were Henderson and New Lynn. Waitakere City&#x27;s workforce was strongly oriented towards Auckland City, with about 40% of all workers living in the city commuting into the Auckland City area for work from the late 2000s.

<doc id="702521" wikidata="Q487444" url="?curid=702521" title="Carl Allen (drummer)">
<text>Carl Allen (born April 25, 1961) is an American jazz drummer.

Allen attended William Paterson University.

He has worked with a wide variety of musicians, including Freddie Hubbard, Jackie McLean, George Coleman, Phil Woods, the Benny Green Trio, and Rickie Lee Jones.

It was with Green that Allen met bassist Christian McBride. The two have teamed up frequently, working for many combos of big name leaders. McBride recruited Allen for his band, Christian McBride &amp; Inside Straight. Allen is that quintet&#x27;s drummer for both its first recording, &quot;Kinda Brown&quot;, and its road tours.

In 1988, Allen and Vincent Herring founded Big Apple Productions, which produced several albums featuring young jazz performers.

He joined the faculty of The Juilliard School in 2001 and became the Artistic Director of Jazz Studies in 2008. He was replaced as director by Wynton Marsalis in 2013 and left Juilliard at the end of the academic year.

In 2011, Allen appeared as himself in two episodes of the HBO series &quot;Tremé&quot; in a studio recording scene in New York City.

In 2014, he formed his own group, The Art of Elvin, to pay tribute to drummers Art Blakey and Elvin Jones. The band debuted at the Percussive Arts Society (PAS) conference in Indianapolis, Indiana with Allen on drums, Freddie Hendrix (trumpet), Tivon Pennicott (tenor sax), Xavier Davis (piano), and Yasushi Nakamura (bass).

In 2021, Allen joined the faculty of the University of Missouri - Kansas City (UKMC) Conservatory as the William D. and Mary Grant Endowed Professor of Jazz Studies.

<text>Carl Meredith Allen (1925–1994) was an American merchant mariner who claimed that during World War II he witnessed the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;, a supposed paranormal event where the United States Navy made a ship invisible and accidentally teleported it through space. The story is widely understood to be a hoax perpetrated by Allen, something he confessed to several times over the years, then recanted, then confessed to again.

==Biography==
Carl Allen was born on May 31, 1925, in Springdale, Pennsylvania the eldest of five children. His family described him as brilliant in school with a &quot;fantastic mind&quot; but also as a person who never held any particular job for long and was a drifter. He was also known as a &quot;master leg-puller&quot;, pulling pranks on people, or to get out of work in general. In 1942 he joined the US Marine Corps but was discharged less than a year later. Right after that he enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine, at first serving on the and then many other ships until 1952 when he left service. Allen would later claim that in 1943 he witnessed an invisibility experiment carried out by the U.S. Navy at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (the so-called Philadelphia Experiment), met Albert Einstein there, and for several weeks, was schooled in physics by Einstein.

During his lifetime he would use many aliases including Carlos Miguel Allende, Senor Professor and Colonel Carlos Miguel Christofero Allende, and, one time when he wrote to the rocket engineer Wernher von Braun, Dr. Karl Merditt Allenstein. He turned up in various places including Colorado, Mexico, eventually ending up in Greeley, Colorado where he died on March 5, 1994.

==Connection to the Philadelphia Experiment==
In late 1955 an anonymous package arrived at the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR). It contained a copy of Morris K. Jessup&#x27;s book &quot;The Case for the UFO: Unidentified Flying Objects&quot; that was filled with handwritten notes in its margins, written with three different shades of blue ink, appearing to detail a debate among three individuals. They discussed ideas about the propulsion for flying saucers, alien races, and express concern that Jessup was too close to discovering their technology. When Jessup was invited to the Office of Naval Research a year later and shown the annotated copy of his book, he noticed the handwriting of the annotations resembled a series of letters he received from Carl Allen, who also signed some of his letters &quot;Carlos Miguel Allende.&quot; In the letters to Jessup, Allen put forward a story of dangerous science based on unpublished theories by Albert Einstein which had been put into practice at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1943. Allen claimed to have witnessed this experiment while serving aboard the . In Allen&#x27;s account, a destroyer escort was successfully made invisible, but the ship inexplicably teleported to Norfolk, Virginia for several minutes, and then reappeared in the Philadelphia yard. The ship&#x27;s crew was supposed to have suffered various side effects, including insanity, intangibility, and being &quot;frozen&quot; in place. When Jessup wrote back requesting more information to corroborate his story Allen said his memory would have to be recovered and referred Jessup to what seems to be a non-existent Philadelphia newspaper article that Allen claimed covered the incident.

Twelve years later Allen would say that he authored all the annotations in order “to scare the hell out of Jessup.”

The Jessup book with Allen&#x27;s scribbled commentaries gained a life of its own when the Varo Manufacturing Corporation of Garland, Texas, who did contract work for ONR, began producing mimeographed copies of the book with Allen&#x27;s annotations and Allen&#x27;s letters to Jessup, first a dozen and eventually 127 copies. These copies came to be known as the &quot;Varo edition.&quot; This became the heart of many &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot; books, documentaries, and movies to come. Over the years various writers and researchers who tried to get more information from Carl Allen found his responses elusive, or could not find him at all.

<text>Phineas Pett (1 November 1570 – August 1647) was a shipwright and First Resident Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard and a member of the Pett dynasty. Phineas left a memoir of his activities which is preserved in the British Library and was published in 1918.

==Family background==
Born at &quot;Deptford Strond&quot;, he was the second son of Peter Pett of Deptford, his elder brother being named Joseph.

Thomas Fuller, in his &quot;Worthies of England&quot; states: &quot;I am credibly informed that the mystery of Shipwrights for some descents hath been preserved successfully in families, of whom the Petts about Chatham are of singular regard.&quot;

It is likely that Robert Holborn, cited as working with Peter Pett of Deptford at this time was a relative of Richard Hoborn, &#x27;Cousin of Commissioner Pett&#x27;. Peter Pett of Deptford was the son of Peter of Harwich (died 1554). His sister married John Chapman, Master Shipwright, whose own son Richard was born in 1620 and Master Shipwright of Woolwich and Deptford dockyards. the shipwright who was to build the &quot;Ark&quot;, raised in the Pett household, &quot;as in all probability was Mathew Baker&quot; with whom, from 1570, Peter Pett was associated in the works at Dover.

Phineas&#x27;s father&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth Paynter, had given him a daughter, Lydia, and four sons; their mother died around 1543. Peter Pett of Deptford married his second wife Elizabeth Thornton, the sister of Naval Captain Thornton, and they had eight further children. The three sons were Phineas, Peter and Noah. Elizabeth died, the widow of Peter, in 1597.

==Life==
Phineas had been sent to the Free School at Rochester for three years and then moved to a private school in Greenwich, until in 1586 aged 16 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. On his father&#x27;s death in 1589, Phineas was left destitute. Yet by 1601 Phineas had been appointed assistant to the Master Shipwright at Chatham; over the years his good services, particularly in fitting out the Fleet in six weeks, won support for him at court.

Phineas Pett first met the young Prince Henry in 1604, through the good graces of the Earl of Nottingham, William Howard, the Lord High Admiral. Pett made a miniature ship for the Prince at Chatham. The keel was 28 feet and the breadth 12 feet, and was finished &quot;battlement-wise&quot; like the &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. On 22 March Pett presented the ship to Prince Henry, who named it the &quot;Disdain&quot; and &quot;entertained it with great joy, being purposely made to disport himself withal.&quot; On 26 April 1604, James I of England gave Phineas, described as a servant of Prince Henry, a grant of a shilling a day. The grant also mentions Phineas&#x27;s elder brother, Joseph. Phineas and Joseph were named in the royal charter for the incorporation of masters and wardens of the &quot;Art and Mystery of Shipbuilding in England&quot; in April 1605.

In 1607, Pett made and gave a model of a ship intended for Prince Henry to Howard. Howard thought the model good enough for the direct attention of King James and the Prince. He arranged for a presentation in the presence of both at Richmond Palace on 12 November 1607. The model was set up in a private room off the Long Gallery, in an arched frame curtained with crimson taffeta. King James being likewise impressed and &quot;exceedingly delighted with the sight of the model&quot; placed the task of constructing a full-size replica of the ship in Pett&#x27;s charge.

In 1610, Phineas&#x27;s wife gave birth to their son, Peter, and in the same year, his (step) Aunt Lydia died. In February 1613 Pett worked with Robert Mansell to organise lavish fireworks and sea-fight or naumachia on the Thames to celebrate wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate. Pett himself was captain of a Venetian argosy, which he had converted from an old pinnace called &quot;The Spy&quot;. Pett wrote that he was in more danger in this &quot;jesting business&quot; than if had been on active sea-service in earnest.

In his diary for 1616, he records that he was &#x27;elected and sworn Master of the Corporation of Shipwrights at our common hall and meeting place at Redriff.&#x27; From sometime around 27 March 1616, Pett expected to profit from a commission by Sir Walter Raleigh to build him a vessel of 500 tons for £500. Admiral Howard permitted Pett to lay her keel on the galley dock at Woolwich, with the consent of King James.

In 1631, he was appointed a commissioner of the King for making &quot;a general survey of the whole navy at Chatham.&quot; For this and other works Pett was promoted by Charles to be a principal officer of the Navy, receiving £200 per annum. His patent was sealed on 16 January 1631. In the same year the King, Charles I of England, visited Woolwich to view the launch of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;, which Pett had built. The king honoured Phineas by participating in a banquet at his lodgings. Pett was later the First Commissioner at Chatham and held this same post from 1631 until his death in 1647.

In June 1634 Phineas made a model ship on wheels for the four-year-old Prince Charles, for use in the long gallery at St James&#x27;s Palace.

Phineas lived for ten years after the &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot; was launched. In the burial register of the parish of Chatham it is recorded, &quot;Phineas Pett, Esqe. and Capt., was buried 21 August 1647.&quot;

<doc id="702531" wikidata="Q1156651" url="?curid=702531" title="Communion of saints">
<text>The communion of saints (Latin: , ), when referred to persons, is the spiritual union of the members of the Christian Church, living and the dead, but excluding the damned. They are all part of a single &quot;mystical body&quot;, with Christ as the head, in which each member contributes to the good of all and shares in the welfare of all.

The earliest known use of this term to refer to the belief in a mystical bond uniting both the living and the dead in a confirmed hope and love is by Saint Nicetas of Remesiana (); the term has since then played a central role in formulations of the Christian creed. Belief in the communion of saints is affirmed in the Apostles&#x27; Creed.

The word &quot;sanctorum&quot; in the phrase can also be understood as referring not to holy &quot;persons&quot;, but to holy &quot;things&quot;, namely the blessings that the holy persons share with each other, including their faith, the sacraments and the other spiritual graces and gifts they have as Christians.

== History ==
The concept of the communion of saints is linked with Paul&#x27;s teaching, as in Romans 12:4–13 and 1 Corinthians 12:12–27, that in Christ Christians form a single body.

The New Testament word (, &#x27;saint&#x27;) can refer to Christians who, whatever their personal sanctity as individuals, are called holy because they are consecrated to God and Christ. This usage of the word &quot;saint&quot; is found some fifty times in the New Testament.

The Heidelberg Catechism, citing Romans 8:32, 1 Corinthians 6:17, and 1 John 1:3, asserts that all members of Christ have communion with him, and are recipients of all his gifts. Similarly, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is communicated to the others... We must therefore believe that there exists a communion of goods in the Church. But the most important member is Christ, since he is the head... Therefore, the riches of Christ are communicated to all the members, through the sacraments.&#x27; &#x27;As this Church is governed by one and the same Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common fund.

The persons who are linked in this communion include those who have died and whom Hebrews 12:1 pictures as a cloud of witnesses encompassing Christians on earth. In the same chapter, Hebrews 12:22–23 says Christians on earth &quot;have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in Heaven, and to a judge who is God of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.&quot;

== Western Christianity ==
=== Roman Catholicism ===
In Roman Catholic terminology, the communion of saints exists in the three states of the Church, the Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant. The Church Militant () consisting of those alive on earth; the Church Penitent () consisting of those undergoing purification in purgatory in preparation for Heaven; and the Church Triumphant () consisting of those already in Heaven. The damned are not a part of the communion of saints. Roman Catholics ask the intercession of saints in Heaven, whose prayers are seen as helping their fellow Christians on earth (Revelation 5:8).

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church:

=== Lutheranism ===
Martin Luther defined the phrase thus:

Lutheranism affirms that the Church Militant and Church Triumphant share a common goal and thus do pray for one another. The Book of Concord, the official compendium of Lutheran doctrine teaches:

&quot;... we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application &quot;ex opere operato&quot; of the Lord&#x27;s Supper on behalf of the dead.&quot; By the expression , he meant the belief that the performance of the rite would of itself benefit the dead. 

The largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, &quot;remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints&quot;. In Funeral rites of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, &quot;deceased are prayed for&quot; using &quot;commendations: &#x27;keep our sister/brother ... in the company of all your saints. And at the last ... raise her/him up to share with all the faithful the endless joy and peace won through the glorious resurrection of Christ our Lord.&#x27;&quot; The response for these prayers for the dead in this Lutheran liturgy is the prayer of Eternal Rest: &quot;rest eternal grant him/her, O Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon him/her&quot;.

=== Methodism ===
In Methodist theology, the communion of saints refers to the Church Militant and Church Triumphant. The Rev. Katie Shockley explains the communion of saints in the context of the Methodist sacrament of the Eucharist:
The communion of saints is celebrated in Methodism during Allhallowtide, especially on All Saints&#x27; Day.

Methodist theology affirms the &quot;duty to observe, to pray for the Faithful Departed&quot;. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, &quot;taught the propriety of Praying for the Dead, practised it himself, provided &quot;Forms&quot; that others might.&quot; It affirms that the &quot;saints in paradise&quot; have full access to occurrences on earth.

=== Anglican Communion ===
The Anglican Communion holds that baptized Christians &quot;are &#x27;knit together&#x27; with them &#x27;in one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of [Christ]&#x27;.&quot; The Church of Ireland teaches that:

In Anglican liturgy, &quot;worship is addressed to God alone&quot; and the Anglican Communion &quot;does not pray to the saints but with the saints&quot;. However, Anglicans pray &quot;for&quot; the dead, &quot;because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God&#x27;s presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is.&quot;

=== Reformed churches ===
The Westminster Confession, which articulates the Reformed faith, teaches that the communion of saints includes those united to Christboth the living and the dead.

== Eastern Christianity ==
=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
==== Greek Orthodox Church ====
In Greek Orthodoxy, &quot;the Church is also a communion of saints, an assembly of angels and men, of the Heaven and of the earth ... divided into what is known as the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant&quot;.

The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America teaches that &quot;Through the work of the Holy Trinity all Christians could be called saints; especially in the early Church as long as they were baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity, they received the Seal of the Spirit in chrismation and frequently participated in the Eucharist.&quot;

Theologians classify six categories of saints within Eastern Orthodoxy:

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
==== Armenian Orthodox Church ====
The Armenian Orthodox Church understands the communion of saints to have a twofold sense: &quot;first, of the union of members of the Church with the Head Christ; and, secondly, of the mutual help and support of these same members in obtaining enjoying, and preserving the common good things or graces of the Church.&quot;

== Comparison of views ==
Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Orthodox churches practice praying &quot;for&quot; the dead (as they interpret 2 Timothy 1:16–18). Reformed churches do not pray for the dead. The Anglican tradition has been ambivalent about prayers for the dead historically, sometimes embracing and other times rejecting the practice.

With regard to the various views held about the communion of saints, the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1907 wrote:

<doc id="702538" wikidata="Q78676" url="?curid=702538" title="Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen">
<text>Johann Philipp Carl Joseph Stadion, Count von Warthausen (18 June 1763 in Mainz – 15 May 1824, Baden) was a statesman, foreign minister, and diplomat who served the Habsburg empire during the Napoleonic Wars. He was also founder of Austria&#x27;s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank. He was sovereign Count of Stadion-Warthausen from 1787 until 1806, when his lands were mediatised to the Kingdom of Bavaria.

== Early life ==
Johann was born as the younger surviving son of Count Franz Konrad von Stadion-Warthausen (1736–1787) and his wife, Baroness Maria Johanna Ludowika Esther Zobel von Giebelstadt (1740–1803).

== Life and career ==

In 1787–1790, he was ambassador in Stockholm, then in London from 1790 to 1793. After some years of retirement, he was entrusted with a mission to the Prussian court (1800–1803), where he endeavoured in vain to effect an alliance with Austria. He had greater success as envoy at Saint Petersburg (1803–1805), where he played a large part in the formation of the third coalition against Napoleon (1805). Notwithstanding the failure of this alliance, he was made foreign minister and, in conjunction with Archduke Charles of Austria, pursued a policy of quiet preparation for a fresh trial of strength with France.

In 1808, he abandoned the policy of procrastination and hastened the outbreak of a new war. Stadion was encouraged by news from Spain regarding the rising of the Spanish population against French occupation and the defeat of a French army by Spanish general Francisco Castanos at Bailen. He was instrumental in persuading Emperor Francis of Austria to attempt to arouse popular resistance to Napoleon in Austria and Germany.

The war that began in 1809 pitted Austria alone on the continent against Napoleonic France. The campaign saw the first major defeat of Napoleon at Aspern by the Archduke Charles, brother of the Emperor. Nonetheless, the French recovered and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Austrians at Wagram, one of the largest battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The unfortunate results of the campaign of 1809 compelled his resignation. He was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Klemens von Metternich, whom the Emperor had recalled from Paris. Nonetheless, in 1813, he was commissioned to negotiate the convention which finally overthrew Napoleon.

The last ten years of his life were spent in a strenuous and partly successful attempt to reorganize the disordered finances of his country. As minister of finance (1815–1824), he founded Austria&#x27;s central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 1816.

== Personal life ==
On 4 November 1773 in Mainz, he married his cousin, Countess Maria Anna Philippine Walpurgis von Stadion-Thannhausen (1771–1841), daughter of Count Joseph Georg Johann von Stadion zu Thannhausen (1652-1742) and his wife, Baroness Maria Anna Wambolt von Umstadt (1687-1764). Together, they had eight children. Among them was Franz Stadion, Count von Warthausen, a prominent liberal statesman of the 1840s.

== Death ==
He died on 15 May 1824 in Baden bei Wien, Austria.

==Acknowledgements==
* In 1874, an alley in Vienna&#x27;s 1st district was renamed &quot;Stadiongasse&quot; in honour of Johann Philipp von Stadion.
* Since 1897, the Hotel Graf Stadion on Buchfeldgasse Nr. 5 in Vienna&#x27;s 8th district Josefstadt bears the statesman&#x27;s name.

<text>The Bridge of Sighs in Cambridge, England is a stone covered bridge at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. It was built in 1831 and crosses the River Cam between the college&#x27;s Third Court and New Court. The architect was Henry Hutchinson.
It is named after the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, although they have little architecturally in common beyond the fact that they are both covered bridges with arched bases. The bridge, a Grade I listed building, is a Cambridge attraction and Queen Victoria is said to have loved it more than any other spot in the city.

==History==
In the early 19th century, St. John&#x27;s College added accommodation on the west side of the River Cam, an area known as the Backs, with the construction of New Court. The new buildings and the bridge linking them with the original college buildings were designed in 1827 by Henry Hutchinson in the fashionable Gothic Revival style. Construction was completed in 1831, shortly before his death.

On two occasions, students have pulled the prank of dangling a car under the bridge. In the first incident (in June 1963), a 1928 Austin 7 was punted down the river using four punts that had been lashed together, then hoisted up under the bridge using ropes. The second incident (in 1968) a Bond or Reliant Regal three-wheeler car was dangled under the bridge. In neither case was the bridge damaged.

The bridge was a favourite spot of former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who had photos taken there in 1947 when he was a student, upon Lee Hsien Loong&#x27;s graduation in 1974 and in 2000.

==In popular culture==
The bridge was a filming location for &quot;&quot; in 2007 and &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; in 2014. The bridge can also be seen in the music video for the song &quot;High Hopes&quot; by Pink Floyd.

<text>Hertford Bridge, often called the Bridge of Sighs, is a skyway joining two parts of Hertford College over New College Lane in Oxford, England. Its distinctive design makes it a city landmark.

==Misnomer and myth==
The bridge is often referred to as the Bridge of Sighs because of its supposed similarity to the better known Bridge of Sighs in Venice.

There is a false legend saying that many decades ago, a survey of the health of students was taken, and as Hertford College&#x27;s students were the heaviest, the college closed off the bridge to force them to take the stairs, giving them extra exercise. However, if the bridge is not used, the students actually climb fewer stairs than if they do use the bridge.

==Building==

The bridge links together the Old and New Quadrangles of Hertford College (to the south and the north respectively), and much of its current architecture was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson. It was completed in 1914, despite its construction being opposed by New College.

The building on the southern side of the bridge houses the college&#x27;s administrative offices, whereas the northern building is mostly student accommodation. The bridge is always open to members of the college, who can often be seen crossing it. The bridge is Grade II listed.

<doc id="702556" wikidata="Q879128" url="?curid=702556" title="Bit time">
<text>Bit time is a concept in computer networking. It is defined as the time it takes for one bit to be ejected from a network interface controller (NIC) operating at some predefined standard speed, such as 10 Mbit/s. The time is measured between the time the logical link control sublayer receives the instruction from the operating system until the bit actually leaves the NIC. The bit time has nothing to do with the time it takes for a bit to travel on the network medium but has to do with the internals of the NIC.

To calculate the bit time at which a NIC ejects bits, use the following:

 bit time = 1 / NIC speed

To calculate the bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC, use the formula as follows:
 bit time = 1 / (10 * 10^6)
 = 10^-7
 = 100 * 10^-9
 = 100 nanoseconds

The bit time for a 10 Mbit/s NIC is 100 nanoseconds. That is, a 10 Mbit/s NIC can eject 1 bit every 0.1 microsecond (100 nanoseconds = 0.1 microseconds).

Bit time is distinctively different from slot time, which is the time taken for a pulse to travel through the longest permitted length of network medium.</text><links>

<text>Kalapana is a town and a region in the Puna District on the Island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. The town was the original location of the Star of the Sea Painted Church.

In 1990, lava flows from the Kūpaʻianahā vent of Kīlauea destroyed and partly buried most of the town, as well as Kalapana Gardens and nearby Royal Gardens subdivisions. The lava flow that destroyed Kalapana erupted from the southeast rift zone of Kīlauea. Along with the destruction of Kalapana were those of the nearby town of Kaimū and Kaimū Bay, both of which now lie buried beneath more than 50 feet of lava. The lava flow created a new coastline.

In July 2010, lava from Kīlauea continued into the Kalapana region destroying a home that was only 5 years old, leaving 35 homes remaining in the Kalapana Gardens Subdivision. The 2010 lava flow partly covered the 1986–1992 flow field again, while attracting thousands of visitors a day.

Access to the village was reestablished and a thriving farmers market was held every Wednesday night until May, 2018 when lava flows impacted nearby roads. For many years the lava flow from Puʻu ʻŌʻō continued, for a time entering the sea at Kamokuna. In May 2018, destructive new lava vents opened in nearby Leilani Estates. Access to Kalapana was restricted to residents until July 3, 2018, when the road was reopened to all motorists.

<text>Deborah Lynn Foreman (born October 12, 1962) is an American photographer and actress. She is perhaps best known for her starring role in the 1983 film &quot;Valley Girl&quot; opposite Nicolas Cage. She is also regarded as a scream queen and known for playing in various horror films of the 1980s, such as &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Waxwork&quot;, &quot;Destroyer&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Foreman was born October 12, 1962, in Montebello, California, the daughter of Lynette and Clyde Foreman, a Marine Corps pilot. She was raised in Arizona and Texas. When she was 13, her parents enrolled her at the Barbizon School of Modeling in Houston to help her overcome shyness, where she received a trophy after completing the courses. In high school, Foreman received high marks and was a cheerleader. While she was still a student, local photographer Wally Lewis hired her for newspaper and catalog ads. A chance meeting with a representative of Wilhelmina Models led to her signing with its California office and modeling assignments for Maybelline cosmetics.

==Career==
Four weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, Foreman earned her SAG card after appearing in a McDonald&#x27;s of England commercial. Resolving to become a serious actress, she took acting lessons from a variety of teachers. Her first acting job was in a comedy pilot for NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Grady Nutt Show&quot;. More television work and two supporting film roles soon followed. After a 1983 appearance on the popular sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot;, her first starring role in a feature film was &quot;Valley Girl&quot; (1983) with the then-little-known Nicolas Cage, which brought her national fame. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer did not care for &quot;Valley Girl&quot; and wrote that Foreman was &quot;too passive to carry the movie&quot; while her counterpart at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; enjoyed the same movie. Mark Deming of AllMovie wrote that Foreman &quot;made an indelible impression on fans of 1980s pop culture with her performance in the title role of the film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;&quot;.

In 1985, Foreman had a small role in the comedy film &quot;Real Genius&quot;. In 1986, she was named &quot;Most Promising New Star&quot; by ShoWest, the largest and most notable film convention in the world.

She had a starring role in the comedy film &quot;My Chauffeur&quot; (1986), in which she played a somewhat Madonna-influenced character who gets a job as a driver for a stuffy limousine service. &quot;My Chauffeur&quot; was publicized widely, but connected only modestly with teen audiences and critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Lawrence Van Gelder wrote &quot;Miss Foreman, who with discipline and far better script might become an engaging comedienne, is mired here in a character who at one moment is delivering a lecture on proper treatment of women and at the next is smirking.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Michael Wilmington called Foreman a &quot;New Wave Carole Lombard crossed with early Shirley MacLaine&quot;. However, Robert Blau of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that Foreman &quot;gives a breathlessly irritating portrayal of Casey&quot;. By contrast, Charles Taylor of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; wrote that Foreman &quot;is an appealing comic actress who goes at even the most inane situations with tireless enthusiasm and dimpley sex appeal&quot; and although &quot;she can&#x27;t salvage &quot;My Chauffeur&quot;, she does give perkiness a good name.&quot;

That same year, Foreman played dual roles in the offbeat dark comedy and preppy murder mystery &quot;April Fool&#x27;s Day&quot;. Although her performance was praised by reviewers, the film&#x27;s plot and surprise ending were widely panned, with critic Vincent Canby commenting for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;... the dialogue is mostly composed of rude variations on &#x27;eek,&#x27; &#x27;ugh&#x27;, and &#x27;I&#x27;d like to sleep with you this evening.&#x27;&quot; The reviewer for AllMovie wrote &quot;With her Sheryl Lee-like features and facial expressions, Deborah Foreman makes an appealingly off-balance scream queen&quot;.

During the five years following, Foreman appeared in over half a dozen low-budget horror movies and independent films. Syndicated columnist Joe Bob Briggs gave Foreman a &quot;Drive-in Academy Award nomination as the damsel in distress&quot; for saying &quot;It&#x27;s all very simple! Bunny men from Neptune have invaded Mars!&quot;

Though she retired from acting in 1991, Foreman did make a brief appearance in a music video for the rock band She Wants Revenge, as well as a small cameo as a shopgirl in the 2020 remake of &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, her best known film.

<doc id="702579" wikidata="Q753647" url="?curid=702579" title="Drake &amp; Josh">
<text>Drake &amp; Josh is an American teen sitcom created by Dan Schneider for Nickelodeon. The series follows teenage stepbrothers Drake Parker (Drake Bell) and Josh Nichols (Josh Peck) as they live together despite their opposite personalities. Nancy Sullivan and Jonathan Goldstein star as Drake&#x27;s mother and Josh&#x27;s father, respectively, and Miranda Cosgrove plays Drake&#x27;s devious younger sister. Bell performs the series&#x27; theme song, &quot;I Found a Way&quot;, written by Bell and Backhouse Mike.

Bell and Peck previously appeared in &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, a Nickelodeon variety series created by Schneider that ran on Nickelodeon from 1999 to 2002. A sketch featuring Bell and Peck arguing over a piece of shrimp prompted network executives to cast the two actors in their own spin-off, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;. The series premiered on January 11, 2004, on Nickelodeon to critical acclaim. 

During production of the fourth season, Bell was injured during a car accident, and filming stalled for four months during his recovery. A television film, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh Go Hollywood&quot;, premiered in early 2006. A television special, &quot;Really Big Shrimp&quot;, served as the series finale, and the series&#x27; final new broadcast episode aired on September 16, 2007, marking 56 episodes in 4 seasons for the show. After the finale, the network aired the one-time special &quot;Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh&quot; in 2008.

&quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; was a ratings success, garnering 3.2 million viewers for its premiere, and it consistently ranked as one of the most watched series in its demographic during its run. It won 2 Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, 2 UK Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and 3 Australian Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and was nominated for 7 other awards, including at the Young Artist Awards and the Casting Society of America. Other media include books, DVD and VHS releases, promotional singles, and video games based on the series.

==Plot==
The series revolves around two teenage stepbrothers, Drake Parker and Josh Nichols, who live in San Diego, California, with Drake&#x27;s younger biological sister Megan and biological mother Audrey, and Josh&#x27;s biological father Walter. Drake is strong, cool and charismatic, having his own band and being popular with girls, yet can be narcissistic and absent-minded, while Josh is intellectual, clumsy, and awkward; yet very loving and caring. Josh starts working at a local movie theater in the second season, which becomes a key set location for the rest of the series. Despite their opposite personalities, Drake and Josh have shown multiple times throughout the series that they care deeply about each other and have each others&#x27; backs. The two boys are often involved in comedic escapades and challenges while handling various teenage problems.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Drake Bell and Josh Peck had previously acted together on &quot;The Amanda Show&quot;, created by Dan Schneider. Bell and Peck&#x27;s differing personalities inspired Schneider to create a new show starring them as characters with traits similar to their own. An unaired pilot episode featured Stephen Furst as Walter Nichols, although he was busy with another project when &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; was picked up as a series, and Jonathan Goldstein was cast in the role instead. A house in Los Angeles&#x27; Encino neighborhood was used for exterior shots of the family&#x27;s home, while interior scenes were shot on a sound stage at the Nickelodeon on Sunset studios in Hollywood. Tribune Studios in Hollywood was also used as a filming location.

Production was suspended in late December 2005, after Bell&#x27;s injury in a car crash, prior to which he had filmed three episodes of the fourth season. Bell&#x27;s accident was the result of a driver falling asleep at the wheel and colliding head-on with Bell&#x27;s 1966 Mustang, which had no seat belts or airbags, resulting in extensive facial injuries. Filming resumed in March 2006 with the episode &quot;My Dinner with Bobo&quot;. The following month, Nickelodeon greenlit an additional seven episodes for the fourth season, and Bell and Peck signed on to direct several episodes. With the extended season, filming continued through July 2006. According to Schneider, the show ended due to a collective decision from the creative forces behind the show.

The profession of the family&#x27;s mother is never revealed on the show, although Schneider had written dialogue into the series finale that would have revealed her profession at a catering business. The scene was filmed, but Schneider ultimately chose to remove it during editing. Schneider said, &quot;On the one hand, I thought it was funny to &quot;finally&quot; reveal it, so casually, in the &quot;very last&quot; episode – there was something ironic about that. But then I decided that, because fans always seemed to have fun trying to figure it out (what &#x27;Mom&#x27;s&#x27; name and job were), it would be better to &#x27;keep the bit going&#x27; for eternity, by &quot;never&quot; revealing it in any episode.&quot;

==Release==

===Broadcast===
&quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; aired on Nickelodeon and premiered in the United States on January 11, 2004. The final episode aired on September 16, 2007.

As of 2006, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; ranked consistently among the 10 most-watched cable shows of the week, and was the top-rated live-action series among children aged 2 to 11 years old. It averaged three million viewers at the time. It proved to be popular with younger viewers. According to Schneider, &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; had its highest ratings in its final season.

===Awards and nominations===
==Films==
The series received two television films. &quot;Drake &amp; Josh Go Hollywood&quot; premiered on January 6, 2006. In the film, Drake and Josh are left at home in San Diego after their parents go on a ten-day cruise. The boys are told to take Megan to the airport so she can visit her friend in Denver, but they accidentally send her on a flight to Los Angeles. Drake and Josh go to Hollywood to get Megan back, but end up stopping a multibillion-dollar heist and booking a guest-spot for Drake on &quot;TRL&quot;. According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, it was the highest-rated program on all of cable during its opening week.

&quot;Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh&quot; premiered on December 5, 2008. Michael Grossman directed the film, and Schneider returned as executive producer. In the film, Drake and Josh try to give a foster family &quot;the best Christmas ever&quot;. The premiere of &quot;Merry Christmas, Drake &amp; Josh&quot; broke the record of most viewers for the premiere of a Nickelodeon film with 9.10 million viewers, a title previously held by &quot;iGo to Japan&quot;.

==Other media==

===Music===


===Video games===
Two video games based on &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; have been released on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. Both of them were published by THQ and released in 2007.

===Books===
A book series based on &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; has been published by children&#x27;s publisher Scholastic since 2006. The books are written by author Laurie McElroy.

A Cine-Manga version titled, &quot;Match Made in Heaven&quot;, was released by TokyoPop in 2006. The book was based on the first two episodes of the first season.

===Online videos===
Beginning in December 2016, Bell and other cast members released a series of short online videos titled &quot;Where&#x27;s Walter?&quot; Bell, Sullivan, and Yvette Nicole Brown reprised their roles for the videos, which involve a search for Walter after he goes missing.

===Possible revival===
In March 2019, Bell announced that he and Peck were working on a &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; revival that would feature both of them reprising their roles. The proposed project would have featured similar characters and scenarios in a more adult, comedic way. At the time, Bell and Peck were in discussions with several networks about the project. 

In October 2021, it was reported that the original proposed revival had been cancelled, as a result of production delays and Bell&#x27;s guilty plea to his recent criminal charges.

In March 2022, Bell and his wife Janet stated that the reboot show they had pitched would be called &quot;Josh &amp; Drake&quot;. Ultimately, the idea was shelved due to creative differences. The show&#x27;s script was said to have been written by Peck. Janet stated, &quot;Josh wrote Drake as a failed musician and Josh wrote himself as a real estate agent. OK, that&#x27;s fine, but Drake is a musician in real life, so it wouldn&#x27;t make sense.&quot; Bell added, &quot;I just asked him to change a couple things and he couldn&#x27;t and my wife wouldn&#x27;t let me do it.&quot; 

In March 2023, Cosgrove told &quot;E! News&quot; &quot;nothing&#x27;s off the table&quot; in regards to a possible revival. 

In August 2024, in addition to the latter statement, Bell stated that he would be open to a revival reprising his starring role but with a new setting with sets of characters in a buddy comedy setting, differing from the original series.

<text>Reinhard Bendix (February 25, 1916 – February 28, 1991) was a German-American sociologist.

==Life and career==

Born in Berlin, Germany, in 1916, he briefly belonged to Neu Beginnen and Hashomer Hatzair, groups that resisted the Nazis. In 1938 he emigrated to the United States. He received his B.A. (1941), M.A. (1943), and PhD (1947) from the University of Chicago, and subsequently taught there from 1943 to 1946. He then taught for a year in the Sociology Department of the University of Colorado Boulder before moving to the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1947 where he remained for the rest of his career.

In 1969 Bendix was elected President of the American Sociological Association. From 1968 to 1970 he served as Director of the University of California Education Abroad Program in Göttingen, Germany. In 1972 he joined the Department of Political Science at Berkeley.

He held guest professorships at numerous universities, including at Columbia University, St. Catherine&#x27;s and Nuffield Colleges at the University of Oxford, the Free University of Berlin, the University of Constance, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and the University of Heidelberg.

Bendix built bridges between American and European sociology, and regarded himself as a mediator. Bendix introduced to American sociologists a new perspective, the comparative-historical studies, moving beyond their local boundaries. He argued that the constellations of legitimating ideas were not mere reflections of life conditions, or social structure, but independent and real forces. In his terms Americans may better understand their own history through its relation to the histories of European nations. The methodological problems raised by such comparisons could have inspired him to propose a philosophy of history, but that was not his goal.

Bendix, who was deeply devoted to teaching, died in Berkeley, California, in 1991 of a heart attack shortly after conducting a graduate seminar together with a young colleague.

==Awards==
In the course of his lifetime, Bendix received many honors, including fellowships from the Fulbright Program and the Guggenheim, a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, as well as being named a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, and was accepted into both the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin. 

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969. Bendix was a member of the American Philosophical Society and received honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds, Mannheim, and Göttingen.

&quot;Work and Authority in Industry&quot; (1956) won the American Sociological Association&#x27;s McIver prize in 1958.

==Academic research==

Bendix&#x27;s major works are: 
*&quot;Work and Authority in Industry&quot; (1956)
*&quot;Social Mobility in Industrial Society&quot; (1959), coauthored with Seymour Martin Lipset
*&quot;Class, Status and Power&quot; (1958, 1966), also with Lipset, is an anthology.
*&quot;Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait&quot; (1960)
*&quot;Nation-Building and Citizenship&quot; (1964, 1976)
*&quot;Kings or People: Power and the Mandate to Rule&quot; (1976)

===&quot;Nation-Building and Citizenship&quot;===
Neil Smelser holds that Bendix&#x27;s book &quot;Nation-Building and Citizenship: Studies of Our Changing Social Order&quot; (1964) &quot;stressed Weber&#x27;s historical-comparative work on politics&quot; and &quot;stands as a unique contribution to the sociology of modernisation, but it both extended and criticised that tradition, which held sway in the 1950s and 1960s.&quot; He notes that Bendix drew attention to the international phenomena of leadership and followership and this &quot;internationalized&quot; the study of social and political development before the appearance of dependency theory and world-systems theory in sociology.

The book popularized the study of European state building.

===&quot;Kings or People&quot;===
Bendix&#x27;s &quot;Kings or People: Power and the Mandate to Rule&quot; (1976) is a comparative-historical work of great sweep. It traces the histories of many societies that experienced a transition from absolutist to democratic rule.

<doc id="702607" wikidata="Q466928" url="?curid=702607" title="American Sociological Association">
<text>The American Sociological Association (ASA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the discipline and profession of sociology. Founded in December 1905 as the American Sociological Society at Johns Hopkins University by a group of fifty people, the first president of the association would be Lester Frank Ward. Today, most of its members work in academia, while around 20 percent of them work in government, business, or non-profit organizations.
ASA publishes ten academic journals and magazines, along with four section journals, including the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot; and &quot;Contexts&quot;.

The ASA had 9,893 members in 2023, as an association of sociologists even larger than the International Sociological Association. It is composed of researchers, students, college/university faculty, high school faculty, and various practitioners The &quot;American Sociological Association Annual Meeting&quot; is an annual academic conference held by the association consisting of over 4,000 participants.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In the summer of 1905, George Washington University professor C. W. A. Veditz began a discussion among sociologists throughout the United States, writing to several dozen people to gauge the need for or interest in forming an sociological organization. Sociologists debated whether there was a need for a separate organization from the American Economic Association, American Political Science Association and the American Historical Association, which most sociologists at the time were members of. Ultimately, a consensus was reached that the time had come for a society of sociologists in the U.S.

In early December, Veditz and eight others wrote to about 300 people inviting them to a special session during the American Economic Association (AEA) and American Political Science Association meetings later that month to discuss the potential formation of a sociological society.

On December 27, approximately 50 people, including one woman, gathered in McCoy Hall at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and, by its end, the group would motion to form a new society of sociologists. Though there would be debate as to integrating this new society with an existing organization, such as the AEA, the group would ultimately decide that the new society ought to be an independent entity.

==== The committee ====
At the end of the day of the initial meeting, those gathered at the meeting formed a five-person committee to develop a plan for the new society and how it should be governed. The committee members would re-convene the next afternoon to review the proposed structure of the society. Council members would include Edward A. Ross, W.F. Wilcox, Albion Small, Samuel Lindsay, D. C. Wells, and William Davenport.

The following men would be elected officers of the new society:

* Lester Frank Ward, president
* William Graham Sumner, first vice president
* Franklin Giddings, second vice president
* C.W.A. Veditz (the professor), secretary and treasurer

When the committee left Baltimore, the birth of the American Sociological Society was complete, a Constitution had been adopted, officers were elected, and plans were made for the second annual meeting of the new society.

=== 1905–1980 ===
In 1981, in celebration the association&#x27;s 75th anniversary, Lawrence J. Rhoades prepared a 90-page publication entitled &quot;A History of the American Sociological Association, 1905–1980&quot;, commonly referred to as the &quot;1981 Rhoades History&quot;. The publication provides a brief overview of the founding and early years of the association, as well as highlights of key activities and events in the decades since.

In 1953, during the annual meeting in Berkeley, California, each of the (living) past presidents of the society would compose a voice recording to address the coming generation of sociologists.

=== 1981–present ===
ASA membership peaked at almost 15,000 in 2007 before declining to its current level below 10,000. The trend led to the formation of a Task Force on Membership in 2016, with recommendations released in 2019, addressing issues of community, cost, and value.

==== 100-year anniversary ====
In 2005, in celebration of the association&#x27;s 100th anniversary, ASA published a 201-page book entitled &quot;A History of the American Sociological Association, 1981–2004&quot;. The publication picks up where the 1981 Rhoades history concludes, continuing the story and capturing the association&#x27;s history from 1981 through 2004. It was the culmination of over two years of detailed research by Katherine J. Rosich.

==== The &quot;ASA Wikipedia&quot; Initiative ====
In the fall of 2011, the ASA launched its &quot;Sociology in Wikipedia&quot; initiative. Erik Olin Wright, President of the ASA, called for improvement in sociological entries in Wikipedia. He asked that professors and students to get more involved by having Wikipedia-writing assignments in class. The basic goal set forth by the initiative would be to make it easier for sociologists to contribute to Wikipedia, and for sociologists to become better involved in the writing and editing processes to ensure that social science articles are up-to-date, complete, accurate, and written appropriately.

In conjunction with the Wikimedia Foundation and a research group at Carnegie Mellon University, the ASA developed its in an attempt to achieve the initiative&#x27;s goal through providing tutorials on how to contribute; video discussions of norms and procedures; and lists of articles and subject areas that need improvement. The Portal would also provide instructions for professors on how to use Wikipedia writing assignments for academic courses.

== Code of Ethics ==
The ASA is governed by a code of ethics, which has been revised since 1970, with the first ASA code of ethics being written in 1970. ASA members are bound by the code of ethics. The association also has codes for meeting behavior, disclosure, award revocation, and removal from leadership positions.

== Publications ==

=== ASA Style Guide ===

ASA style is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers that specifies the arrangement and punctuation of footnotes and bibliographies. Standards for ASA style are specified in the &quot;ASA Style Guide&quot;, which is designed to aid authors in preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

=== ASA Academic Journals and Magazines ===
The association publishes the following academic journals and magazines:
The ASA also publishes &quot;Footnotes&quot;, a newsletter aimed at the association&#x27;s members. &quot;Footnotes&quot; was established in 1979 and is published five times per year.

=== Presidents ===
The following persons have been presidents of the American Sociological Association:

== Meetings ==
The Annual Meeting of the ASA is held each August to provide opportunity for sociologists to share research, develop professional networks, give awards, and hold committee meetings. The 2023 meeting had 4,802 attendees and featured 3000 research papers.

==Awards==
Every year, in August, the ASA presents awards to individuals and groups deserving of recognition. The awards presented are:

* Distinguished Scholarly Book Major ASA Award
* Dissertation Major ASA Award
* Excellence in the Reporting of Social Issues Major ASA Award
* Jessie Bernard Major ASA Award
* Cox-Johnson-Frazier Major ASA Award
* Award for the Public Understanding of Sociology Major ASA Award
* Distinguished Career Major ASA Award for the Practice of Sociology
* Distinguished Contributions to Teaching Major ASA Award
* W.E.B. Du Bois Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award

Additionally, the Sections of the ASA administer separate multiple awards, which are presented each August during the annual meeting.

== Controversies ==
===Jailing of Rik Scarce===
In 1993, then-doctoral student Rik Scarce was jailed for more than five months as a result of following the ASA&#x27;s code of ethics. Scarce&#x27;s Ph.D. research was on the radical environmental movement. Based on an FBI investigation of an Animal Liberation Front break-in, federal prosecutors argued in court that Scarce may have engaged in conversations with individuals believed to be involved with the incident. Prosecutors demanded that Scarce testify to a federal grand jury about those conversations, but Scarce refused to answer three dozen questions, citing the ASA Code of Ethics and the First Amendment as his reasoning for remaining unresponsive. Scarce&#x27;s refusal to answer resulted in a contempt of court citation and 159 days spent in jail. He was never suspected of wrongdoing and—in keeping with contempt of court practice—he was never read his Miranda rights, arrested, or tried.

===Frances Fox Piven and Glenn Beck===
In early 2010, ASA publicly expressed outrage over a controversy involving Frances Fox Piven and Glenn Beck, asking Fox News to stop Beck&#x27;s comments. An article written by Piven concerning mobilization of unemployed individuals had spurred the commentary by Beck. ASA suggests in their public statements that the line should be drawn at name calling and that political commentators should instead rely on gathering evidence related to the topics and then drawing the proper conclusions.

===The Belfast Project===
In January 2012, a United States district court ordered Boston College to turn over material from the &quot;Belfast Project&quot;, an oral history project pertaining to the violence in Northern Ireland. Boston College filed an appeal in February 2012, challenging the district court&#x27;s decision. ASA became involved in the case to help protect human participants from the subpoena of confidential project research data. The statement by the ASA council cited the potential damage this ruling would have on social science research by stifling the ability to study controversial topics. ASA is looking for an affirmation by the court for confidentiality in research.

===Sociologists for Palestine resolution===
From 2023 to 2024, in response to the war in Gaza sociologists organized to request that the American Sociological Association establish a stance calling for a ceasefire and pursuing divestment from arms. In December 2023, a letter signed by 125 sociologists including six former ASA presidents, asked for a statement in support of ceasefire. In February 2024, the association released a statement focusing on &quot;deep concern and dismay regarding the loss of civilian lives in the context of continued violence in Gaza and Israel as well as other contexts of conflict and suffering unfolding across the globe.&quot; In March 2024, ASA rejected a resolution forwarded by a group known as Sociologists for Palestine which called for &quot;an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza&quot;. After this initial resolution was rejected, enough signatures were collected to support a ballot initiative calling for a ceasefire and divestment from military technologies, however the ASA council edited the request for divestment from the resolution claiming that investment represented an &quot;operational issue&quot; which members could not vote on. The Sociologists for Palestine group responded to this by declaring that the council&#x27;s removal of the divestment request from the resolution was &quot;fundamentally undemocratic&quot;. In May 2024, 59% of voting ASA members approved the &quot;Resolution for Justice in Palestine&quot; and it was adopted.
Beyond calling for &quot;an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza&quot;, the adopted resolution specifies that the association &quot;supports members&#x27; academic freedom, including but not limited to defending scholars&#x27; right to speak out against Zionist occupation.&quot;

== Critique ==
Within the Environmental sociology section of the ASA, in 2016 an ad hoc Committee on Racial Equity investigated racial and ethnic diversity within the section in response to critique that the section was overwhelmingly white. Their assessment of the professional climate for scholars of colour concluded that the section was a &#x27;white space&#x27; characterized by the overwhelming presence of whites and dominated by white leadership. They concluded that this situation acts as a barrier to inclusion of people of colour in the field, and that the field of environmental justice was likewise marginalised.

<text>Kalapana is an American pop-rock band from Honolulu, Hawaii. They are known for their songs “Naturally” and “The Hurt”.

==History==
===Early history (1973 – 1986)===
In 1973, childhood friends DJ Pratt and Malani Bilyeu auditioned at the Rainbow Villa for Cecilio &amp; Kapono. Bilyeu was a solo performer at the Oar House in Hawaii Kai while Pratt was downstairs at Chuck’s in Sunlight with Kirk Thompson. They got together in Pratt’s grandfather’s garage with Mackey Feary, another solo act at the Oar House. They wrote songs, rehearsed, and at one point discussed the meaning of Kalapana. The literal translation of the word “Kalapana” is “sprouting money”. Thompson said the meaning was “beat of the music”, but he preferred the name “Dove” for the band. Pratt thought it meant “black sand”. Regardless, they named themselves Kalapana, playing their first gig at Chuck’s in Hawaii Kai.

Kalapana became a regular band at a Honolulu club called The Toppe Ada Shoppe. They opened concerts for Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Batdorf &amp; Rodney, The Moody Blues, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, and Cecilio &amp; Kapono. 

In 1975, the band released their debut self-titled album &quot;Kalapana&quot;, featuring Jackie Kelso on sax and flute, Bill Perry on bass, and Larry Brown on drums. The album was a big success in Hawaii and Japan.

Their second album &quot;Kalapana II&quot; was released in late 1976. The band performed a three-concert event at the Waikiki Shell during the span of June 25–27, 1976, where 25,000 people attended. 

Kalapana won two Nani Awards, the predecessor to the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards. They were nominated for four categories and received Best Performance by a Duo or Group, and Best Male Vocalist (for Feary), who by year&#x27;s end had split from the group for a solo career.

With Pratt, Bilyeu, and Thompson remaining, the group added bassist and vocalist Randy Aloya (replacing the departed Feary), sax and woodwinds player Michael Paulo, and drummer Alvin Fejarang. The band’s third album &quot;Kalapana&quot; &quot;III&quot; was released in late 1977. Earlier that year, Kalapana helped select the entrants for the &quot;Home Grown&quot; album project.

Kalapana’s fourth album &quot;Many Classic Moments&quot;, primarily a soundtrack to the Gary Capo-helmed surf film of the same name, was released in 1978. The domestic version of the album contained eight Kalapana tracks while the Japanese version was a two-record set with 22 tracks total, featuring additional orchestral music composed by David Wheatley.

With Kalapana’s popularity in Japan going strong, the band toured there regularly, adding keyboardist and guitarist Kimo Cornwell (formerly of Beowolf and later with Hiroshima). The 1978 live album &quot;In Concert&quot; was released only in Japan. After the album’s release, Kirk Thompson left the band to pursue a solo career as a producer. His first project as writer, arranger, and producer, the self-titled (and only) album by new Hawaii band Lemuria, was released in 1979.

Kalapana continued as a six-piece with the 1979 album &quot;Northbound.&quot; Randy Aloya left the group soon after the album’s release, with Malani Bilyeu and Michael Paulo also exiting after the album’s tour had ended. 

In 1980, DJ Pratt and Alvin Fejarang continued as Kalapana and released &quot;Hold On&quot; and the live album &quot;Japan Jam Live&quot;, both Japan-only releases. The band would then go on hiatus.

On December 26, 1982, Bilyeu, Feary, Thompson, Fejarang, Paulo, and Aloya played a one-night &quot;Kalapana Live Reunion&quot; concert at the Waikiki Shell with Hawaii guitarist John Rapoza standing in for Pratt. Kalapana then went dormant for several years while the various members pursued separate projects.

===Hurricane and Pony Canyon (1986 - 1999)===
In 1986, Kalapana reunited as a quintet—Bilyeu, Feary, and Pratt plus Gaylord Holomalia (keyboards) and Kenji Sano (electric bass) – and recorded a successful comeback album, &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Kalapana presented the album at a release party at Rascals discothèque in Waikiki. The invitations were sent out with singles from the album; roses and T-shirts were given away at the venue.

For the &quot;Hurricane&quot; concert, the band wore suits. For the song &quot;Living Without You&quot;, the band was brought out wearing white zoot suit dinner jackets with red velvet bow ties. Kenji, Mackey, Malani, and DJ performed choreography during the concert while Gaylord anchored the group on keyboards.

Kalapana released &quot;Lava Rock&quot; in 1987, and performed with Hiroshima and Anri, musicians from Japan. Kalapana played at the grand opening of the Hard Rock Cafe in Honolulu. They performed in the Philippines for crowds of 10,000 people at two sold-out concerts, toured Japan, the west coast of the contiguous US, Tahiti, Samoa, Guam, Saipan, and outer islands; their first feature-length video of the Lava Rock Concert was taped at the Waikiki Shell. Kalapana toured Japan with Michael Paulo, who was then with Al Jarreau&#x27;s band, and Tris Imboden, the drummer for Chicago. Following, Kalapana signed a five-album deal with Pony Canyon Records.

In 1997, Kalapana released the Hawaii version of &quot;Captain Santa Island Music&quot; with liner notes by international radio DJ Kamasami Kong. More recently, Kalapana released, in Japan, another CD titled &quot;The Very Best of Kalapana&quot;, a compilation of twenty songs.

After battling drugs, drug treatment programs, and relapses, Mackey Feary was sentenced to prison. On February 20, 1999, Feary hanged himself in his jail cell. Feary&#x27;s problems and eventual suicide called attention to the patterns of drug addiction and mental health and treatment needs.

===Post-Feary era (1999 and onward)===
During the summer of 1999, Kalapana released &quot;Love Under the Sun&quot;, the title song for FM Nagoya&#x27;s compilation CD, which was used for FM Nagoya&#x27;s Summer Campaign. Also, they recorded the theme song for the Asahi Super Cup, a series of sailboat races held off the coast of Oahu. Both recordings were done at TK Disc Studios, which are Japanese recording artist/producer Tetsuya Komuro&#x27;s recording studios in Hawaii.

In November 2002, the group released the studio album the &quot;Blue Album&quot;. Two songs off of the said album feature Maurice Bega on vocals. Guest artists included the group Chant singing background vocals on &quot;Ten Years After&quot; (written by Komuro), Tris Imboden from the band Chicago on &quot;Another Lonely Night&quot;, Michael Paulo on saxophone, and Pauline Wilson and Garin Poliahu on drums. James Studer appears throughout the CD with arrangements and keyboards.

Kalapana continues to tour and record in Japan and the West Coast. The releases, to date, on Pony Canyon are: &quot;Back In Your Heart Again&quot;, &quot;Kalapana Sings Southern All-Stars&quot;, and &quot;Walk Upon the Water&quot;. The fourth LP, &quot;Full Moon Tonight&quot;, was released at the time of the royal wedding in Japan in June 1995, and included a new version of &quot;Hawaiian Wedding Song&quot; done R &amp; B style. Their latest album on Pony Canyon Records, &quot;Captain Santa Island Music&quot;, consists of songs written for a clothing line in Japan. Each album contains new arrangements of Kalapana classics and newly written songs.

Kalapana received the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. The recipients were Bilyeu, Feary (posthumously), Pratt, Thompson, Fejarang, Paulo, Aloya, Holomalia, and Sano.

On Sunday, November 20, 2016, Kalapana, performed in Honolulu with the Honolulu Youth Symphony with a line-up of Bilyeu, Pratt, Holomalia, Aloya (bass guitar), John Valentine (guitar), Garin Poliahu drums, and Todd Yukumoto (sax).

On December 27, 2018, Malani Bilyeu died of a heart attack on Kaua‘i. He was 69. From the beginning, Bilyeu was one of Kalapana’s resident songwriters. His contributions included &quot;Naturally,&quot; &quot;You Make It Hard,&quot; &quot;Dorothy Louise,&quot; &quot;(For You) I’d Chase a Rainbow,&quot; &quot;Girl,&quot; and &quot;Many Classic Moments.&quot;

On September 7, 2021, DJ Pratt was found unresponsive in his home. He was 67. Pratt received two Na Hoku Hanohano Awards for his work as a member of Kalapana. He earned three more for his work as a recording studio engineer.

===Legal action against Abattoir Records===

The early recordings of Kalapana were originally released on Abattoir Records, a label based in Los Angeles and owned by Ed Guy. However, Guy never paid any royalties, and the band received nothing from Guy for approximately forty years. In June 2017, the original members of the band (with Feary&#x27;s son and heir Sebastian) sued Guy in federal court in Los Angeles for rescission of the mid-1970s agreements. The case was settled quickly, and Guy transferred all of his rights back to the band, including all music publishing rights.

As a result, on November 30, 2018, under Manifesto Records, the seven-album, eight-CD box set &quot;The Original Album Collection&quot; and the single-CD “best of” package &quot;Black Sand: The Best of Kalapana&quot; were released.

<doc id="702635" wikidata="Q1361002" url="?curid=702635" title="Human sexual response cycle">
<text>The human sexual response cycle is a four-stage model of physiological responses to sexual stimulation, which, in order of their occurrence, are the excitement, plateau, orgasmic, and resolution phases. This physiological response model was first formulated by William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, in their 1966 book &quot;Human Sexual Response&quot;. Since that time, other models regarding human sexual response have been formulated by several scholars who have criticized certain inaccuracies in the human sexual response cycle model.

==Excitement phase==
The excitement phase (also known as the arousal phase or initial excitement phase) is the first stage of the human sexual response cycle, which occurs as a result of physical or mental erotic stimuli, such as kissing, making out, fantasizing or viewing erotic images, that leads to sexual arousal. During this stage, the body prepares for sexual intercourse, initially leading to the plateau phase. There is wide socio-cultural variation regarding preferences for the length of foreplay and the stimulation methods used. Physical and emotional interaction and stimulation of the erogenous zones during foreplay usually establishes at least some initial arousal.

===Excitement in both sexes===

Among both sexes, the excitement phase results in an increase in heart rate, breathing rate, and a rise in blood pressure. A survey in 2006 found that sexual arousal in about 82% of young females and 52% of young males arises or is enhanced by direct stimulation of nipples, with only 7–8% reporting that it decreased their arousal. Vasocongestion of the skin, commonly referred to as the sex flush, will occur in approximately 50-75% of females and 25% of males. The sex flush tends to occur more often under warmer conditions and may not appear at all under cooler temperatures.

During the female sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then spread to the breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and possibly over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and the walls of the vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms. The sex flush typically disappears soon after orgasm occurs, but this may take up to two hours or so and, sometimes, intense sweating will occur simultaneously. The flush usually diminishes in reverse of the order in which it appeared.

An increase in muscle tone (myotonia) of certain muscle groups, occurring voluntarily and involuntarily, begins during this phase among both sexes. Also, the external anal sphincter may contract randomly upon contact (or later during orgasm without contact).

===Excitement in males===
In males, the beginning of the excitement phase is observed when the penis becomes partially or fully erect, often after only a few seconds of erotic stimulation. The erection may be partially lost and regained repeatedly during an extended excitement phase. Both testicles become drawn upward toward the perineum, notably in circumcised males where less skin is available to accommodate the erection. Also, the scrotum can tense and thicken during the erection process.

===Excitement in females===
In females, the excitement phase can last from several minutes to several hours. The onset of vasocongestion results in swelling of the woman&#x27;s clitoris, labia minora and vagina. The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening grows tighter and the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating organic liquid. Meanwhile, the breasts increase slightly in size and nipples become hardened and erect.

== Plateau phase ==

The plateau phase is the period of sexual excitement prior to orgasm. The phase is characterised by an increased circulation and heart rate in both sexes, increased sexual pleasure with increased stimulation and further increased muscle tension. Also, respiration continues at an elevated level. Prolonged time in the plateau phase without progression to the orgasmic phase may result in sexual frustration.

=== Plateau in males ===
During this phase, the male urethral sphincter contracts (preventing urine from mixing with semen, and retrograde ejaculation) and muscles at the base of the penis begin a steady rhythmic contraction. Males may start to secrete seminal fluid or pre-ejaculatory fluid and the testicles rise closer to the body.

=== Plateau in females ===
The plateau stage in females is basically a continuation of the same changes evident in the excitement stage. The clitoris becomes extremely sensitive and withdraws slightly, and the Bartholin glands produce further lubrication. The tissues of the outer third of the vagina swell, and the pubococcygeus muscle tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. Masters and Johnson refer to the changes that take place during the plateau stage as the orgasmic platform.

==Orgasm phase==
Orgasm is experienced by both males and females, ending the plateau phase of the sexual response cycle. Orgasm is accompanied by quick cycles of muscle contraction in the lower pelvic muscles, which surround both the anus and the primary sexual organs. Orgasms are often associated with other &quot;involuntary&quot; actions, including vocalizations and muscular spasms in other areas of the body and a generally euphoric sensation. Heart rate is increased even further. Tantric sex practices may seek to diminish the goal of achieving orgasm, which is frequently a common goal of sexual intercourse.

=== Orgasm in males ===
In males, orgasm is usually associated with ejaculation. Each ejaculation is accompanied with continuous pulses of sexual pleasure, especially in the penis and surrounding area. Other sensations may be felt strongly among the lower spine or lower back. The first and second convulsions are usually the most intense in sensation and produce the greatest quantity of semen. Thereafter, each contraction is associated with a diminishing volume of semen and a milder sensation of pleasure.

=== Orgasm in females ===
Women also experience uterine and vaginal contractions. Orgasms in females can vary widely from individual to individual. They are commonly associated with an increase in vaginal lubrication, a tightening of the vaginal walls and overall pleasure. For some women, there is also a possibility of female ejaculation.

==Resolution phase==
The resolution phase occurs after orgasm and allows the muscles to relax, blood pressure to drop and the body to slow down from its excited state. The refractory period, which is part of the resolution phase, is the time frame in which usually a man is unable to orgasm again, though women can also experience a refractory period.

=== Resolution in males ===
Masters and Johnson described the two-stage detumescence of the penis: In the first stage, the penis decreases from its erect state to about 50 percent larger than its flaccid state. This occurs during the refractory period. In the second stage (and after the refractory period is finished), the penis decreases in size and returns to being flaccid. It is generally impossible for men to achieve orgasm during the refractory period. Masters and Johnson argue that this period must end before men can become aroused again. 

Although, due to the refractory period, it is rare for men to achieve &quot;multiple orgasms&quot;, some men have reported having multiple, consecutive orgasms, particularly without ejaculation. Multiple orgasms are more commonly reported in very young men than in older men. In younger men, the refractory period may only last a few minutes, but last more than an hour in older men.

=== Resolution in females ===
According to Masters and Johnson, women have the ability to orgasm again very quickly, as long as they have effective stimulation. As a result, they are able to have &quot;multiple orgasms&quot; in a relatively short period of time. Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms, soon after the first, some sources state that men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement. For some women, the clitoris is very sensitive after climax, making additional stimulation initially painful. After the initial orgasm, subsequent orgasms for women may also be stronger or more pleasurable as the stimulation accumulates.

==Similarities and differences between sexes==

Masters and Johnson argue that, despite some minor differences, sexual responses in both men and women are fundamentally similar. However, researchers have argued that there are many differences between men and women in terms of their response. First, Masters and Johnson put forth one model for men, but three different models for women. They stated that men&#x27;s sexual response only differs in terms of duration; showing different models would, thus, be repetitive. Women, on the other hand, they state can have responses that differ in both intensity and duration. These variations can pose problems because psychologists have argued that not everyone fits this model; for example, most women do not orgasm during penetrative sexual intercourse. Masters and Johnson also equate a man&#x27;s erection with a woman&#x27;s vaginal lubrication during the excitement phase; Roy Levin states that this observation is false. A woman&#x27;s clitoris is the anatomical parallel to a man&#x27;s penis. As a result, clitoral swelling would be the equivalent of a man&#x27;s erection.

Another aspect is the lack of concordance between subjective sexual arousal and genital arousal. Research by Meredith L. Chivers and J. Michael Bailey indicates that men tend to show category-specific arousal; that is, they are sexually aroused by their preferred gender. However, women show category non-specificity: Their genitals show arousal to both preferred and non-preferred genders. Even though women reported being subjectively aroused to, for example, a man and woman engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex.

Overall, Masters and Johnson&#x27;s model appears to be a better example of men&#x27;s sexual response than women&#x27;s.

==Criticisms==
There has been much research conducted based on Masters and Johnson&#x27;s model. However, inaccuracies have been found in the descriptions of the stages of sexual response. For example, Roy Levin identified a few areas of the model that had not been touched upon. First, Masters and Johnson state that only the vagina is lubricated during the arousal stage; Levin argues that the labia produce their own lubricant. Levin also presents research which shows that the first signs of physiological arousal in women is increased blood flow to the vagina, not lubrication. He also dispels information about men and their sexual response; Masters and Johnson report that pleasure was positively associated with the volume of ejaculate released, but Rosenberg, Hazzard, Tallman and Ohl gave a group of men a questionnaire and found that significantly more men reported that physical pleasure was associated with the strength of the ejaculation compared to the volume. Moreover, some researchers have found that some men can have multiple orgasms, despite what Masters and Johnson had reported.

Some researchers have also criticized how Masters and Johnson define sexual response solely in terms of physiology; for example, Everaerd, and Laan have found that sexual arousal can be defined as an emotional state in both men and women. Other researchers have stated that there is a lack of concordance between women&#x27;s subjective sexual arousal and their genital arousal. Rosemary Basson argues that this model poorly explains women&#x27;s sexual response, especially for those who are in long-term relationships.

==Other models==

Shortly after Masters and Johnson published their book, several scholars criticized their model of the human sexual response cycle. For example, Helen Singer Kaplan argued that Masters and Johnson only evaluated sexual response from a physiological perspective, and that psychological, emotional, and cognitive factors need to be taken into consideration. As a result, she proposed her model of the sexual response cycle which includes three phases: desire, excitement, and orgasm. She argues that these three phases are interconnected, yet they have different neurophysiological mechanisms. Similarly, Paul Robinson argued that the excitement and plateau phases are the same; he criticizes Masters and Johnson&#x27;s work for not clearly distinguishing when the excitement phase ends, and when the plateau phase begins.

Another model that has been put forth is the incentive-motivation model. The model explains that the desire for sex comes from an interaction between a sensitive sexual response system and stimuli that are present in the environment. Researchers argue that this model supports the idea that sexual desire is not spontaneous. Furthermore, this model implies that the case is not that one has sex because one feels sexual desire; rather, the case is that one feels sexual desire because one has sex.

Rosemary Basson proposed an alternative model of sexual response. She argues that the linear model is good at explaining men&#x27;s sexual response but it poorly explains women&#x27;s sexual responses; thus, she puts forth a &quot;circular model&quot;. She states that closeness or attachment to a partner increases the effectiveness of sexual stimulation. This leads to enhanced sexual arousal, which may ultimately result in orgasm. Consequently, this positive sexual arousal continues the sexual desire that women feel, and this desire increases intimacy with the partner. Other researchers have attempted to evaluate women&#x27;s sexual functioning in terms of this new model but have found contradictory results. In one study conducted by Giles and McCabe, they found that the linear model of sexual response was a good predictor of women&#x27;s sexual functioning (and dysfunction), while the circular model was a poor predictor. Once they modified the pathways of the model, the circular model then became a good predictor of sexual functioning. In another study looking at Malaysian women, researchers found that the circular model was actually a good predictor of women&#x27;s sexual desire and arousal. More research needs to be done in this area to show whether the circular model more accurately describes women&#x27;s sexual response.

==Sexual dysfunctions==

The human sexual response cycle set the foundation for studying and categorizing sexual dysfunctions in men and women. There are four main categories of sexual dysfunctions: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasm disorders, and sexual pain disorders. They are still categorized as such in the &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;. Recent research, however, suggests that the current model of sexual response needs to be revised to better treat these dysfunctions. One reason is that there is considerable overlap between sexual dysfunctions in women. One study found that in patients with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), 41% of women had at least one other sexual dysfunction and 18% had diagnoses in all three categories (that is, in desire, arousal, and orgasm disorders).

Another issue is that, among women, there is a discrepancy between desire and arousal. After Cynthia Graham critically evaluated female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), she found that women reported that, contrary to Masters and Johnson&#x27;s model, sexual arousal sometimes preceded sexual desire; at other times, desire presented before arousal. Because of the high comorbidity rates between HSDD and FSAD, she would like to merge them to make the category &quot;Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder.&quot; Hartmann and colleagues summarize their views of the current model of the sexual response cycle and conclude that &quot;by simply expanding and continuing DSM-IV criteria and the traditional response cycle classification systems, it is impossible to come to diagnostic categories and subtypes that adequately reflect real-life female sexual problems&quot;.

<doc id="702650" wikidata="Q3339085" url="?curid=702650" title="Warriors (NRL)">
<text>The Warriors are a professional rugby league football club based in Auckland, New Zealand that competes in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and is the League&#x27;s only team from outside Australia. They were formed in 1995 as the Auckland Warriors, and are affectionally known as the &quot;Wahs&quot;. The Warriors are coached by Andrew Webster with the captaincy position presently being vacant, after previous captain Tohu Harris announced his retirement in January 2025. The Warriors are based at Mount Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose.

For the 1995 season the newly formed Auckland Warriors became the first club from outside Australia to be admitted to the Australian Rugby League&#x27;s premiership when it expanded from 16 to 20 teams. As a result of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Auckland left the ARL to compete in the Super League competition of 1997, before joining the re-unified NRL the following year. They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. The club has yet to win a premiership as of 2023. They have won one minor premiership (in 2002), and reached two grand finals (2002, 2011), reaching the finals eight times.

==History==
===History of the bid===
Rugby league in New Zealand was largely centred around Auckland since the establishment of the New Zealand Rugby League in 1909. Auckland produced the bulk of the New Zealand team for many years, and a number of these players were recruited to play professionally in either Australia or England.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Auckland representative side consistently provided strong opposition to touring teams. An Auckland team was admitted into the mid-week ARL Amco Cup competition in 1978. In their first year they made the semi-finals, and were defeated by the overall competition winners, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. They remained in the competition until the early 1980s. In 1987, an Auckland side toured Great Britain and claimed wins over powerhouse clubs Leeds and Wigan.

In 1988, serious investigation into an Auckland team entering the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) commenced, encouraged mainly by Mount Albert, which at that time was one of the strongest rugby league clubs in the country. On 17 May 1992, it was announced that an Auckland-based club would enter the Australian Rugby League competition in 1995. This followed very good turnouts to a number of NSWRL matches played in Auckland. The new team was to be called the Auckland Warriors and would be run by the Auckland Rugby League. The original colours selected were blue, white, red and green. Blue and white are recognized as the traditional sporting colours of Auckland, while red and green were the colours of the Warriors&#x27; original sponsor, DB Bitter. The original logo was designed by Francis Allan, of Colenso.

=== First season – 1995 ===
The coach of the new team would be former Parramatta and Wigan coach John Monie. A number of senior players were signed, such as Greg Alexander and Andy Platt. Captain Dean Bell was a high-performing signing. Former Rugby union players such as John Kirwan and Marc Ellis were brought in, in later years.

The Warriors&#x27; first year in the Australian Rugby League was 1995. Their debut match was against the Brisbane Broncos on 10 March 1995 in front of 30,000 people at a newly refurbished Mount Smart Stadium. The Warriors led 22–10 at one point in the second half of the match, however Brisbane defeated the new club 25–22.

A home crowd attendance record of 32,174 was set at Mount Smart Stadium in Round 6 of the 1995 ARL season, a record that was not topped until Round 1 of the 2011 NRL season (albeit that match was played at Eden Park, not Mount Smart Stadium).

The Warriors were deducted two competition points for an interchange error. In a match against Western Suburbs, the Warriors used five interchange players instead of the allowed four. The Warriors won the match, 46–12. This error led to the club ultimately missing the finals by two competition points. The season saw the debut of future star, Stacey Jones, who scored a try on debut in a 40–4 rout of the Parramatta Eels in Sydney.
=== Second year blues – 1996 ===
The Australian Rugby League season 1996 could have been regarded as a better one for the Warriors. The Warriors found themselves siding with the Super League during the Super League War when the New Zealand Rugby League signed up to the rebel competition. They claimed their first &#x27;victory&#x27; over the Brisbane Broncos in round one of the competition that year, after all Super League clubs agreed to boycott the first round of the competition in protest. The Warriors won the two points when they travelled to Brisbane with a squad of players that were unsigned to Super League, forcing the Broncos to forfeit the match.

With four rounds remaining the Warriors were in sixth place in the competition, seemingly headed for a finals berth. They proceeded to lose all four matches to tumble out of the finals.

===Super League war – 1997===
The Warriors spent 1997 in the breakaway Super League Telstra Cup competition. Despite the reduced number of teams, they failed to make an impression on the competition. Monie was replaced by Frank Endacott as coach midway through the 1997 season. The only positive was the team&#x27;s performance in the World Club Challenge. The Warriors defeated United Kingdom powerhouses Wigan and St Helens, as well as Warrington. The Warriors were knocked out in the semi-finals by eventual winners the Brisbane Broncos, going down 16–22.

=== Beginning of the NRL era – 1998 ===
The first season of the reformed competition was a year that saw few highlights for the club. It was readily apparent that the club needed a new approach and attitude. Fortunately for them, they were in a better position than the other two clubs that joined the competition in 1995.

===Tainui era – 1999===

Former Kiwi Mark Graham took over as coach in 1999. The club was sold off to a consortium that included ex-Kiwi coach Graham Lowe and the Tainui tribe. The club again disappointed on field, but a mid season ultimatum saw a strong finish to the season, with the side winning five of their last six games. The signs appeared promising for the new millennium.

===Financial collapse and reinvention – 2000===

In National Rugby League season 2000 the Warriors could only finish second last. This season included the Warriors&#x27; second largest ever loss in their history to date, 54–0 to St. George Illawarra in Wollongong. Alarmingly, the problems off-field overshadowed the on-field problems. The majority shareholders were under intense financial pressure, and the club&#x27;s future was looking bleak at best. The key assets of the club were purchased by business tycoon Eric Watson. This did not include player contracts, and many players were released and had to fight to get the money they had been promised. Ultimately only 10 players from the 2000 season were retained.

The club was re-branded as the New Zealand Warriors, with new colours of black and grey – resembling the national sporting colours. New coach Daniel Anderson and CEO Mick Watson focused on signing unknown New Zealand talent. There were only six Australians in the 2001 squad, and only three foundation players – Monty Betham, Stacey Jones and Logan Swann.

===First finals series – 2001===

In a season where the re-branded New Zealand Warriors were tipped to finish in second-last place behind the North Queensland Cowboys, the team surprised all, qualifying for their first ever finals appearance in the National Rugby League season 2001.

The Warriors were involved in Round 8 in one of the biggest near-comebacks in the history of the NRL. Down 24–8 to the Bulldogs with under six minutes remaining, the Warriors rattled off three tries in as many sets, only failing to win the match as Stacey Jones missed a conversion from in front of the posts in the final minute.

After a mid-season struggle, the Warriors upset the minor premiers Parramatta 29–18 at home, in what was a highlight match.

Then, with their season on the line, the team won four matches in a row, starting with impressive 34–8, 30–0, and 14–8 home victories over fellow finals-bound teams the Bulldogs, Cronulla, and the Sydney Roosters. The Warriors also scored 24 unanswered points in the final quarter to beat the Panthers 48–32. Their first finals appearance was sealed with a bruising 24–24 draw with the Melbourne Storm at Colonial Stadium, but the effects of this match were seen a week later, as the Warriors were beaten by 30–18 at home by the Cowboys, a win that saw the North Queenslanders avoiding the wooden spoon.

In their first-ever finals appearance, they were defeated by the Minor Premiers, the Parramatta Eels 56–12. The loss was at the time the largest in finals series history.

===Minor Premiership and Grand Final – 2002===
The Warriors reached their zenith to date in the National Rugby League season 2002. They won the &quot;Minor Premiership&quot;, finishing in first place at the conclusion of the regular season after the Bulldogs lost 37 competition points late in the season due to severe salary cap breaches. The club played what stands as the first finals match to have been held outside Australia at Mt Smart Stadium in the first week of the Finals Series. The Warriors would defeat their bogey side the Canberra Raiders 36–20 after surviving an early scare.

For the Preliminary Final against the Cronulla Sharks at Stadium Australia the Warriors&#x27; sponsors, such as Vodafone New Zealand and Eric Watson, purchased 15,000 tickets and gave them away for free to anyone with a New Zealand passport. Reportedly, in the 45,000 crowd there were more Warriors supporters than Cronulla supporters – astonishing considering Cronulla are a Sydney-based club. The Warriors went on to win 16–10 with John Carlaw scoring a famous try after latching onto a pinpoint Stacey Jones grubber-kick.

The Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters was a tight match for the first hour. The Warriors trailed 2–6 at half time, but took a lead just after halftime when Jones scored a great grand final try – as he left defenders sprawling in his wake on a 40-metre run to the try line. The Roosters ran away with the match in the final 20 minutes after captain Brad Fittler was involved in a head clash with Warriors prop Richard Villasanti. The final score was 8–30.

===Top-eight again – 2003===
2003 was another quite successful year for the Warriors.

After blowing an early 16–0 lead to lose 26–36 to the Newcastle Knights in Round 1, the Warriors embarked on a five-match winning streak to announce themselves as contenders for the season. However, the Warriors then struggled through the middle-stages of the season, squandering a 26–12 lead with eight minutes remaining to lose to the Parramatta Eels dramatically 28–26 at Parramatta Stadium. There was also an insipid 10–30 loss in Townsville to the North Queensland Cowboys. They played their first ever extra time match, defeating South Sydney 31–30, recovering from a 6–24 deficit.

The Warriors secured their playoff spot, ultimately finishing sixth on points differential, a dangerous position to finish, as the 6th-placed finishers had been eliminated after the first week of the playoffs in the past three seasons.

Their first finals match was against the Bulldogs at the Sydney Showground (now Giants Stadium). The Warriors turned on one of their finest performances ever, stunning the Bulldogs early to lead 16–4 at halftime, and after a Canterbury comeback tied the scores at 16-all, scoring five tries in 16 minutes to blow the Bulldogs away, eventually winning 48–22. Winger Francis Meli scored five tries, a finals record. This prompted Graham Lowe, a known critic of the Warriors to say that the Warriors would win the premiership. The next week a Stacey Jones field-goal in the dying minutes got the Warriors past a gallant Canberra Raiders 17–16. They however lost in the Preliminary Final to the Minor Premiers and eventual Premiers Penrith Panthers, 20–28. It was a disappointing loss for the Warriors, who did not lead at any point of the match, and blew their chance early in the second half to take their first lead, when Henry Fa&#x27;afili lost the ball with the line wide open.

===Worst year yet – 2004===
Before the National Rugby League season 2004 started, there were predictions of the Warriors having a highly successful season. These were proved wrong, as the Warriors managed to only win six games to finish equal last, only escaping the wooden spoon by having a superior points differential to the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Coach Daniel Anderson resigned mid-season after an embarrassing 52-point loss to the Sydney Roosters. His assistant Tony Kemp was given the head coach position, and in his first game in charge the Warriors recorded an emotional 20–14 win over Canberra. A week later, the Warriors&#x27; first match in Christchurch since 1996 was a flop, as the Warriors were destroyed by the Wests Tigers 4–50. The season finished with an embarrassing six-game losing streak.

The management looked to rescue a poor year with some high-profile signings. Bulldogs captain Steve Price was signed, as was Kiwis captain Ruben Wiki, North Queensland half Nathan Fien and Roosters winger Todd Byrne.

===Rebuilding begins – 2005===
2005 was an improvement over the horror scenes of 2004. The team remained competitive for all of their matches, and their largest loss was only 18 points. The team had a good chance to make the finals, however a four match losing streak late in the season removed those chances. The season was tinged with sadness, as it was announced it would be star halfback Stacey Jones last season with the club before he would join French Super League club, Catalans Dragons. His last match for the team against Manly at Brookvale Oval was a fine way for him to sign off with the club as he scored the match-winning try with three minutes to go in a 22–20 victory.

At the end of the season the structure of the team was reviewed. CEO Mick Watson resigned and was replaced by Wayne Scurrah. Tony Kemp was sacked as coach and his assistant Ivan Cleary replaced him as head coach.

===Salary cap drama – 2006===

In February 2006, the Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap in 2005. This followed the high-profile signings of Steve Price and Ruben Wiki. On 27 February the NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be fined A$430,000.

Even before the penalty the Warriors were expected to struggle and were being picked as wooden spooners in some quarters. With the four-point deduction, the Warriors won their first NRL game away from Auckland, with a 26–10 victory over the reigning premiers, the Wests Tigers, at Jade Stadium in Christchurch.

On 25 June the Warriors recorded their largest ever win, defeating South Sydney 66–0 at Stadium Australia, as part of a four-match winning streak that claimed the scalps of the Sydney Roosters, Newcastle Knights, and also the Penrith Panthers. This streak was ended in an 18–22 golden-point loss to the Bulldogs, in a game where the Warriors surrendered an early 16–0 lead.

The Warriors finished the season on a positive note leaving room for optimism for 2007 and beyond. They caused arguably the upset of the season, defeating the Minor Premiers Melbourne 24–20 at Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne, preventing the Storm from going the full regular season unbeaten at home.

Impressively, it took the Warriors 24 weeks to be completely out of finals contention. The Warriors finished winning eight of their final twelve games, including a 42–16 thrashing of the Roosters in Round 25, which included four tries by Jerome Ropati. Had the Warriors not suffered the four-point deduction, they would have finished in eighth place on the ladder, and hence would have taken part in the finals series. As it was, they finished tenth on the ladder.

There were a number of revelations in the squad. Unheralded halfback Grant Rovelli was a standout performer. Winger Patrick Ah Van has cemented a first grade spot and impressed many with his performances, while George Gatis and Nathan Fien were fine performers at hooker, and centre Simon Mannering has been one of the Warriors most impressive backs.

===Return to the Finals – 2007===

The Warriors completed their pre-season with two wins from three games, defeating the Auckland Lions 64–4, losing to the North Queensland Cowboys 32–14 and defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 36–6.

The Warriors finished the 2007 season in fourth place. The season began with a 34–18 victory over Parramatta at Mt Smart Stadium. The following week the side created history by winning their first two games of the season with a 24–14 victory over premiers, the Brisbane Broncos – the first time they have ever won their opening two games of the season.

After a good start which saw the team sitting in fourth place with a 4–2 win–loss record, the team hit a period of indifferent form, falling into a six match losing streak following a last minute win over South Sydney. The team returned to form, defeating Cronulla 12–2 in wild weather at Toyota Park. Following that victory the side won 9 out of 12 games, with one draw. The Warriors clinched a playoff spot with a 36–14 win over an understrength Manly side, and claimed a home final the following week, defeating the Penrith Panthers 24–20 at Penrith Stadium in Round 25.

The Warriors, by virtue of finishing the regular season in fourth place, won the right to host one of the finals matches in the first week of the playoffs. However, the Warriors narrowly went down to the Parramatta Eels 12–10 at Mount Smart Stadium, and their season ended with a 12–49 loss to the Cowboys in Townsville.

On 30 May the Warriors signed Australian Kangaroos&#x27; centre, Brent Tate from 2008 to 2010 in what was described as a &quot;major coup&quot; for the New Zealand club.

===Second-half revival – 2008===

The 2008 season did not start as brightly for the club, losing Wade McKinnon for much of the year during a pre-season loss to Newcastle, and losing captain Steve Price (rugby league, born 1974) for ten weeks, as well as injuries to other key players Manu Vatuvei, Jerome Ropati and Michael Witt. The team remained in contention for much of the season, however often performed very poorly away from Mt Smart Stadium, and suffered their first loss to South Sydney (28–35) since 1999, and went on to lose to South Sydney again later in the season (16–18). Despite poor results away, strong home form and a now common revival in the second half of the season saw the Warriors make the top eight for the second season running, incredibly despite spending only three weeks in the top eight all season. A top-eight berth was secured in the last game of the season, when the Warriors defeated the Parramatta Eels 28–6 at Parramatta Stadium, marking the first time since 1995 that the Warriors had won away to Parramatta.

With nothing to lose in the first week of the finals, the Warriors caused arguably the greatest finals upset ever, and arguably greatest victory in the history of the club, defeating the Melbourne Storm 18–15 at Olympic Park; in doing so, they became the first 8th placed team to beat the minor premiers, with Michael Witt scoring two minutes from full-time to clinch the win. Witt taunted Melbourne captain, Cameron Smith, before placing the ball for the historic victory.

In week two of the playoffs, the Warriors came from behind to defeat the Sydney Roosters 30–13 at Mt. Smart Stadium. The Sydney Roosters led 13–6 at halftime before a second-half comeback saw the Warriors pile on twenty-four unanswered points to earn the Warriors a place in the preliminary finals. This was the first time since 2003 that the Warriors have reached the grand final qualifier, and third overall in 14 seasons. They however went down heavily to an inspired Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 32–6.

=== Tragedy strikes – 2009 ===
2009 started with the loss of young up-and-comer Sonny Fai, who drowned at Bethells Beach, near Auckland. He had gone into dangerous surf to rescue some relatives but was probably sucked under by a rip. Almost as if using the occurrence as an inhibitor, the Warriors had a very disappointing year, despite winning the opening two rounds against eventual grand finalists Parramatta Eels 26–18 and reigning premiers Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.

After those great wins they proceeded to win a poor 1 of 8 games including a draw.
They did however manage to beat West Tigers 14–0 and Newcastle 13–0 keeping both opponents scoreless, but it was the poor attacking that had every league fan questioning. and ultimately saw them lose their next 3 matches by heavy scores. They did beat the Roosters 30–24 at SFS and Raiders 34–20 at Mt Smart Stadium. But in the end the Warriors lost their final two games against the Bulldogs in Hazem El Masri&#x27;s last home game [before the finals] and ultimately ended their season losing 0–30 to the eventual premiers Melbourne Storm.

===Return to finals football – 2010===
Expectations were not high for the Warriors in 2010 after a disappointing 2009 season. The Warriors bolstered their playing stocks in the pivotal play-making positions by signing Brett Seymour after he was cut by Cronulla and James Maloney from Melbourne. In arguably one of their best ever performances they humbled the Brisbane Broncos 48–16 at Lang Park in Round 3, with Maloney tying a club-record with 28 points (3 tries and 8 goals). Kevin Locke scored a hat-trick in the Warriors miraculous 20–18 win over the Sydney Roosters at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, narrowly escaping a serious hip injury after a high-speed collision with the goal-post (in the process of scoring the game-winning try). The Warriors won five matches in a row for the first time since late in the 2003 season and finished in 5th position in the regular season. They were knocked out of the finals series in the first week, losing to Gold Coast Titans.

===Another Grand Final and the dawn of Shaun Johnson – 2011===

2011 started out as emotional for the Warriors, due to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The Warriors began the 2011 season with an historic match at Auckland&#x27;s Eden Park, the first regular season home game the club had played away from Mt Smart Stadium. The match drew a record home game crowd for the Warriors of 38,405 however unfortunately the Warriors could not repay the large crowd with a victory as they were beaten 24–18 by the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors went on to lose their following two matches and it appeared that Warriors fans were in for another season of disappointment. To their credit the Warriors bounced back and were in the running for a top four position late in the season but finished in 6th spot. Midway through the season coach Ivan Cleary was approached by the Penrith Panthers and was appointed as their coach for the 2012 season. Cleary remained coach for the remainder of the 2011 season and Brian McClennan was to be appointed his successor for the 2012 season. One of the highlights of the season was the unearthing of the young halfback Shaun Johnson who played a key role as the Warriors approached the 2011 finals series.

In week one of the finals series the Warriors were thrashed 40–10 by the Brisbane Broncos. Other results went the Warriors way and they were fortunate to progress to week two of the finals where they would meet a high flying Wests Tigers who had completed their 9th straight victory. The match was expected to go the Tigers way however a brilliant second half comeback by the Warriors culminated in a late and controversial try to Krisnan Inu which saw the Warriors win 22–20 and earn the right to play the Melbourne Storm for a place in the Grand Final.

The Warriors traveled to Melbourne as outsiders but turned in what is considered one of the most complete performances in the club&#x27;s history. The Warriors controlled the match and sealed the Melbourne Storm&#x27;s fate with Shaun Johnson mesmerising the Storm defence to send Lewis Brown in for the try that would send the Warriors to their second ever Grand Final, where they would meet the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.

The Warriors would again start the match as heavy underdogs and with a side boasting only three players who had previously played in a Grand Final (Manly on the other hand could boast their coach and eight players who had won the 2008 NRL premiership with the club, plus another who had won a premiership in 2003 with Penrith). Heavy defence from both sides was the feature until the Warriors opened the scoring with a penalty goal to James Maloney in the 28th minute, but a little more than a minute after the restart, a bad read in defence saw prolific try scorer Brett Stewart in for the 1st try. Just before the break, the Warriors were then unlucky not to receive a penalty for obstruction in the lead up to Manly&#x27;s second try which saw them go into the sheds down 12–2. A further try to Clive Churchill Medal winner Glenn Stewart in the 57th minute saw Manly&#x27;s lead out to 18–2. The Warriors refused to die however, and clawed their way back with tries to Manu Vatuvei and Elijah Taylor in the 63rd and 68th minutes. Unfortunately Maloney missed both conversions which could have taken the score to 18–14 and a grandstand finish, but a try to Manly captain Jamie Lyon with only a minute remaining put the result beyond doubt as the Warriors were beaten by a clinical Manly outfit 24–10 – yet their effort in reaching just their second ever Grand Final (and their first in nine years) was a triumph for the club and departing coach Ivan Cleary and won praise from those in the NRL.

2011 was a successful season all-round for the New Zealand Warriors, with all three grades reaching the Grand Final. The club&#x27;s NYC team defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 31–30 in golden point extra time in the NYCGrand Final to win their second premiership, while NSW Cup affiliate the Auckland Vulcans went down 30–28 after conceding a last minute try to Canterbury-Bankstown in the NSW Cup Grand Final.

===Grand Final hangover – 2012===

2012 was meant to promise so much for the Warriors following their grand final appearance of 2011. A new coach with a successful track record in Brian &#x27;Bluey&#x27; McClennan, a stable squad and strong public support indicated that 2012 could have been the year they finally broke their premiership duck. The season again kicked off with a home game at Eden Park, with a strong crowd of 37,502 witnessing the Warriors go down 20–26 to Manly in a grand final rematch. The match was perhaps an indication of things to come, with the Warriors performing strongly on attack but being let down by weak defence at crucial stages which ultimately cost them the match.

The season did not improve much from that point, with the Warriors failing to find any semblance of consistency throughout the season. There were some highs, such as their 44–22 drubbing of South Sydney, but these were far outweighed by the deep lows. Their season is best summed up by a dismal month of football between Rounds 20 and 23. The Warriors surrendered 19- and 18-nil leads in succession and lost (a first in the history of the game), before leaking 97 points in their next two defeats. In the process they lost all semblance of a quality rugby league team.

Injuries were not kind to the Warriors, with the side using 29 players over the course of the season – the second highest of any team in the NRL. The Warriors season unravelled over the latter rounds. Ultimately Brian McClennan was sacked with three rounds remaining, with assistant coach Tony Iro taking over the reins for the final two rounds. The change of coach did not result in a change of fortunes however, as the Warriors limped out of the season with an eight match long losing streak – a club record.

Following a lengthy search for a new coach former Penrith and Canberra boss Matthew Elliott was appointed as head coach in October 2012.

===A year under Matt Elliott – 2013===

Another horror start for the Warriors in 2013 as they win just 2 of their opening 10 games. The Warriors came back into finals contention winning 7 games out of 8 including a 56–18 win against the Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane. As finals approached the Warriors ended with just 2 wins from their remaining 6 games to see them finish the season 11th. In Round 10, on 18 May the Warriors lost 6–62 to the Penrith Panthers which was their largest ever loss in the club&#x27;s history. Captain Simon Mannering won the club&#x27;s Player of the year and Ngani Laumape won Rookie of the year.

In September, after months of speculation, the Warriors confirmed the signing of former Man of Steel winner Sam Tomkins on a three-year deal from English club Wigan Warriors for a record transfer fee of $1,000,000 NZD.

===Third year since grand final; third head coach – 2014===

In the First edition of the NRL Auckland Nines, The Warriors were favourites to win. They finished top of their pool winning all three games but lost the semi-final to eventual winners North Queensland Cowboys. The Warriors started the season two wins and two losses but in Round 5 after a 37–6 loss to Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks the club sacked head coach Matthew Elliott replacing him former Canberra Raiders player Andrew McFadden. Unfortunately the Warriors missed the playoffs for the 3rd season in a row after missing out on points difference to the Brisbane Broncos. Simon Mannering won his 4th Player of the year award, while David Fusitu&#x27;a won Rookie of the year.

===A year of McFadden; some success, then the losses mount – 2015===

The 2015 season marked 20 years since the Warriors first joined the Australian professional rugby league now known as the NRL.

The Warriors were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines by eventual runners up Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.

Warriors ended the season with eight consecutive loses after Shaun Johnson broke his ankle while scoring a try against Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in Round 20. Ben Matulino was named club Player of the year with Tuimoala Lolohea named club Rookie of the year.

===Big name signings – 2016===

To start 2016 the team welcomed the major signings of 2015 Dally M Fullback of the Year Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, from the Sydney Roosters and Kiwi international Issac Luke, from the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Warriors finished as runners-up in the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines, losing to the Parramatta Eels in the final, 22–4. 

The Warriors started the season losing their first three matches. The Warriors beat the Newcastle Knights 40–18 to record their first win of the season and then defeated the Sydney Roosters in a Golden Point thriller in Gosford a week later. After a loss to Melbourne Storm on Anzac Day, the team came under scrutiny with many calling for the sacking of coach, Andrew McFadden. As well as this, six Warriors players were stood down after mixing prescription drugs with energy drinks.

After 11 rounds, the Warriors stood at four wins from 11 games. As State of Origin came into effect, the Warriors started to elevate their performance. Winning four from five games, with the exception being a golden point loss to the table-topping Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After Round 18, the Warriors were in the top eight and needing only to win four out of their final eight games with three of their final four games on home turf. An achievable target, however, the club recorded just two wins from their final eight games to finish tenth on the ladder and for the fifth year in a row, missed out on finals. Simon Mannering received his fifth Warriors Player of the Year.

On 12 September 2016, it was announced that Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney would replace Andrew McFadden as head coach for 2017, with McFadden being retained as an assistant.

===The Kiwis spine – 2017===

After the restructuring of the Warriors coaching staff and with the signing of Kieran Foran, there was much anticipation leading into the season for the team as the side featured the 2015 Kiwis &quot;spine&quot; (Tuivasa-Sheck, Foran, Johnson, Luke), and coach, Stephen Kearney. The Auckland Nines were perhaps a sign of things to come as the Warriors were left win-less and at the bottom of their pool. They kicked off the regular season with a narrow victory over the Newcastle Knights. It would be one of few wins for the 2017 season. Heading into their first bye of the season, they had just won six from 14 games. Worse was yet to come. After that bye, they defeated the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at Mt Smart Stadium in what would turn out to be their last win of the season. After that, the Warriors would go on a losing streak until the season&#x27;s end, creating a club record of nine straight losses and one of the worst seasons in the club&#x27;s history. As well as this, notable names such as Ryan Hoffman, Jacob Lillyman, Charlie Gubb and Kieran Foran had left the club. After so much promise and hype leading up to the championship, it seemed to have been all too familiar for Warriors fans. So much so, during a school visit in September, after their season had ended, one student asked them why they were &quot;so bad&quot;, while another, who had little knowledge of rugby league, asked them where they finished on the competition ladder.

In December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s season.

===Tuivasa-Sheck dominates to end finals drought – 2018===

After a dismal 2017 season, the Warriors made a few key signings. This included experienced New Zealand Internationals Gerard Beale, Adam Blair, Tohu Harris &amp; Peta Hiku. Significantly it also included veteran journeyman playmaker Blake Green, along with Agnatius Paasi, Leivaha Pulu, Anthony Gelling &amp; Karl Lawton. In the beginning of the year, many people tipped that the Warriors would finish last, and claim their first wooden spoon in history. But surprisingly enough, the Warriors began the season with five straight wins, their best ever start to a season, which included away wins over the Sydney Roosters, Canberra Raiders &amp; the South Sydney Rabbitohs, marking their first win in Perth from numerous attempts. They ended up finishing 8th, but only two competition points out of 4th in one of the closest top 8&#x27;s in NRL History, they played Penrith Panthers in an elimination final on Saturday 8 September at Stadium Australia. This was their first finals series appearance since 2011, but lost to Penrith 27–12.

In April 2018, the Warriors would be sold by long-time owner, Eric Watson, to the Carlaw Heritage Trust and Autex Industries, for $16 million NZD.

To top off the year, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck won the Dally M Medal, becoming the first Warriors player to do so, and the Warriors would become one of four inaugural teams in the NRLW.

This would also be the end of Shaun Johnson&#x27;s first stint at the Warriors.

===A disappointing 25th season – 2019===
The club celebrated its 25th season in top level Rugby League in 2019 by returning to their original jersey and colours, as well as modifying their logo close to their original 1995 logo (with Auckland being replaced by New Zealand). The season got off to a near-perfect start for the Warriors, defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 40–6 at home, which was played the day after the 2019 Christchurch Mosque Shootings. But then things started to go downhill for the club losing heavily in their next two games against the Tigers (34–6), and the Sea Eagles (46–12). A 26–10 win over the Gold Coast Titans at home gave the club hope that 2019 would be as successful as 2018 as, but four straight losses, including close losses against South Sydney in Round 5 (28–24), and a controversial loss to the Melbourne club on Anzac Day (13–12) almost wrote off any chance of another finals appearance. The Warriors then won their next two games against St. George Illawarra (26–18), and Penrith (30–10), but they were unable to win at home, holding a six-game losing streak at Mt Smart, which was finally broken in their shock 24–16 win over Manly in Round 21. But after the win over Manly Warringah, the Warriors were beaten by the Sydney Roosters 42–6, Cronulla 42–16, and South Sydney 31–10 ending any chance of another finals appearance. However, they were able to end the season on a positive note, beating the 4th placed Canberra Raiders 24–20 in Canberra.

After just 16 months of joint ownership, Autex Industries would become the sole-owner of the team after buying out the 66% share in the Warriors owned by the Carlaw Heritage Trust

===COVID Pandemic Season 1 - An Unexpected Sacrifice – 2020===
Going into the 2020 NRL season, the Warriors were looking to improve on their dismal 2019 campaign. However, even before kick off of their first-round game against the Newcastle Knights, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that people travelling into New Zealand would be subject to a mandatory self-isolation period of 14 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this not only meant that the Warriors would have to self isolate for 14 days and not play should they return home, but it would be nearly impossible to accommodate visiting sides. As a consequence the Warriors-based themselves in the Northern New South Wales town of Kingscliff and moved their round 2 game on 21 March against the Canberra Raiders to Cbus Super Stadium on the Gold Coast. Two days after the Raiders game, the NRL suspended the competition, with the aim to resume a shortened season to be held over 20 rounds (including the first two rounds that have already taken place) by 28 May. When the competition resumed, the Warriors started their new campaign on a perfect note, in a memorable 18–0 win over St. George Illawarra at their temporary home at Central Coast Stadium. On 20 June, the day after an embarrassing 40–12 loss to South Sydney, the Warriors sacked Stephen Kearney as coach with former Wests Tigers premiership player Todd Payten taking over as caretaker coach. However, despite their performances, they did improve in the second half of the season with back to back wins over the Wests Tigers (26–20) and Manly (26–22) and were gallant in their loss to the Sydney Roosters (18–10). The Warriors ended up finishing 10th, and saw 2020 as a year of success despite not qualifying for the finals. They flew home on 28 September following their 40–28 win over the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles.

===COVID Pandemic Season 2 - Central Coast Warriors - 2021===
Before the 2021 season, the Warriors signed former St. George Illawarra and Newcastle Knights coach Nathan Brown as head coach. Despite having to be based on the Central Coast again due to a lack of a travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand, the Warriors went into the new season with optimism, firstly, the Warriors upset a star studded Gold Coast 19–6 in their season opener at Gosford. The following week, Newcastle narrowly beat the Warriors 16–20 and were largely written off for their round 3 clash against Canberra at Canberra Stadium, after trailing 31–10 at the 48 minute mark, the Warriors produced their biggest ever comeback scoring 24 unanswered points to win 34–31.

On Easter Sunday, the Sydney Roosters beat the Warriors 32–12 at the Sydney Cricket Ground despite the Warriors being in touch in the first half and would the following week let Manly Warringah in for their first win of the season losing by a Daly Cherry-Evans field goal to record their 2nd loss by less than 6 points in 4 weeks. On 6 April, it was announced that the Trans Tasman bubble had opened two ways, but due to risks that the borders could close and the Warriors and any away team travelling to New Zealand could be stuck there and the NRL could be suspended, the Warriors decided to base themselves in Gosford for the entire year. The Warriors did record some impressive victories since the announcement, upsetting St. George Illawarra at Kogarah 20–14, holding on to beat North Queensland 24–20 in Gosford and winning a thriller to beat the Wests Tigers 30-26 also played in Gosford. Unfortunately for the Warriors, it would be another year where they didn&#x27;t make the finals, as they had a seven-game losing streak between Rounds 12 to 19 and lost their last three games, including a 44–0 loss to the Gold Coast which was labeled as their worst performance of the season.

===COVID Pandemic Season 3 - Homecoming with No Wooden Spoon – 2022===
The Warriors began their season with two losses with defeats against St. George Illawarra in Round 1 (28–16) and the Gold Coast Titans in Round 2 (20–18). Before going on to win their next three matches, beating the Wests Tigers (16–12), Brisbane (20–6) and North Queensland (25–24). However, that streak came to an end when they suffered a defeat to the Sydney Roosters in Round 6 (22–14). 

After the 3-3 start to the season, the Warriors went on to lose eight of their next nine games including defeats to Cronulla in Round 9 (29–10) in a game where the Cronulla side was reduced to 11 players and a 70–10 loss to Melbourne on ANZAC Day which is the club&#x27;s biggest loss in their history.

In this stretch, coach Nathan Brown was sacked following a 44-10 defeat to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.

On 3 July, the Warriors returned home to play at Mt Smart Stadium in New Zealand for the first time in 1038 days. They hosted the Wests Tigers in front of a sold-out crowd of 26,009. They would go on to win the match by a score of 22–2, breaking a 7-game losing streak. 

In the Warriors remaining three home games of the season, the Warriors would go on to lose to the Melbourne Storm 24–12, where winger Ed Kosi scored the only points for the Warriors with 3 tries in his just his second game since being dropped after the Warriors record-breaking loss to the Storm earlier in the season, win against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 42–18, the team&#x27;s biggest win since 2016, and lose to the Gold Coast Titans 27–26 in extra time of the final game of the season, after surrendering a 14-point lead in the final 7 minutes of the match.

In September 2022, the Warriors principal sponsor Vodafone New Zealand announced they would change their name to &quot;One New Zealand&quot;, as they are also naming rights sponsor, the Warriors subsequently announced they would change their name to the &quot;One New Zealand Warriors&quot; from November 2022 onwards.

===&#x27;Up the Wahs&#x27; as the Warriors surge into the top four – 2023===
After 3 years playing out of Australia, the Warriors returned to New Zealand full-time in 2023.

The Warriors had a large amount of turnover from the 2022 season, which included the signings of Kiwis representatives Marata Niukore, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, and Te Maire Martin, as well as 2016 assistant coach Andrew Webster rejoining the club after spending the past two seasons with the Penrith Panthers as an assistant, winning two consecutive premierships.

The team started the year 3-1, which featured victories over the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville, ending the longest away losing streak in club history, as well as the second biggest comeback in club history, defeating the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 32-30 after trailing 26-6 in the first half, which would win the Halberg Awards (which recognizes New Zealand&#x27;s top sporting achievements) &quot;Favorite Sporting Moment&quot; for 2023.

Following a strong start to the year, the team went on to win 2 of their next 7 games, which included 3 consecutive defeats to the Melbourne Storm, Sydney Roosters, and Penrith Panthers, 3 teams which were considered premiership favorites in the preseason, in an 11-day stretch.

With several &quot;contentious&quot; calls in each of the three games, as well as the amount of travel required in a short period, One New Zealand CEO, Jason Paris, took to Twitter to voice frustrations with the NRL and its referees, saying &quot;Are you kidding me? How biased are the @NRL bunker and referees against the @NZWarriors? Have they got money on them to lose?&quot; It&#x27;s like we are permanently against 14 on the field and they want us to play with 12&quot;. Following the threat of legal action by the NRL Referees, Paris apologized for his remarks.

After the 2-5 stretch, the team went on the win 10 of their remaining 12 matches, including 7 consecutively, and 3 games scoring 40+ points. During this period the team also went on to set a new record for consecutive away wins, and secure their first Top 4 berth since 2007.

The team faced the Penrith Panthers in the week one qualifying final, missing halfback Shaun Johnson through injury, they went on to lose the match 32-6, in Sydney.

In week two, the Warriors played the Newcastle Knights at home, defeating the Knights 40-12 to qualify for their first Preliminary Final since 2011. The game would be the 2nd largest attendance in the club&#x27;s history at Mount Smart Stadium, and the 3rd largest attendance for a Rugby League match at the ground (26,083).

In the Preliminary Final in Brisbane against the Broncos, the team was competitive the first half, going into the break 24-12, a score which could have been 24-18 if not for 3 consecutive missed conversion attempts. The second half resulted in a blowout, with the Broncos scoring 3 unanswered tries to finish the game 42-12.

At the annual Dally M Awards, Addin Fonua-Blake and Dallin Watene-Zelezniak were awarded Prop and Winger of the Year respectively, while Shaun Johnson was named the Halfback of the Year, and lost by 1 point in the Dally M Medal race, finishing in 2nd place to Kalyn Ponga. This decision is marred in controversy, as the majority of fans and current and former NRL players claimed he was the clear winner and the most consistent over the whole season. Andrew Webster was named Coach of the Year, winning the award over his former lead coach Ivan Cleary, who was nominated also.

The year also saw a rise of the &quot;Wahs&quot; nickname, with the phrase &quot;Up the Wahs&quot; becoming a sensation. The nickname is contentious among some supporters of the club. many say it implies the club and fans as &quot;cry babies&quot; due to the New Zealand/Australian phrase &quot;Have a wah&quot;, meaning to be sad/upset, usually in a derogatory manner.

===Disappointment in Johnson&#x27;s final season – 2024===
Entering the season with some of the highest expectations in the history of the club, after finishing one game short of the Grand Final the year prior, bolstered by the return of former Dally M Medalist, and club captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck from Rugby Union, and Origin representative Kurt Capewell from the Brisbane Broncos, the season would take a hit early with Addin Fonua-Blake requesting an immediate release to return to Australia. Fonua-Blake&#x27;s request for a release would be accepted, but he would only be free to leave at the end of the 2024 season.

The team showed glimpses of the form shown the previous season, but inconsistency and injuries saw many games decided by small margins, with the team losing 8 of 14 games by 8 points or less, which featured one game being lost with an acrobatic try from Xavier Coates after the full-time siren, two games by field goals in Golden Point, and one game by 2 points due to 3 missed conversions. There were several occasions where the team had great starts in games only to get run down and go on to lose. There was also an ugly 66-6 loss to the Titans in round 16, the Warriors equal worst loss in history. However, they were also able to beat the top teams such as the Panthers where they won 22-20 in Magic Round.

Mitch Barnett would make his State of Origin debut during the season, marking the first New South Welshmen to debut as a Warriors player, and just the third Warriors player to make their State of Origin debut with the club, after PJ Marsh and Kevin Campion.

The season would be the final one of club legend Shaun Johnson&#x27;s career. Announcing his retirement between Round 22 and Round 23. In the final match of the season, the team would make a 16-point comeback in the second half, the third largest in club history, and win the game off a cutout ball from Johnson to Dallin Watene-Zelezniak to score a try with less than 30 seconds remaining in the match.

Despite the relatively poor performances, the Warriors would go on to sell out every home game of the season, which is believed to be a first for an Australasian sporting franchise, as well as a first for either Rugby code.

==Head-to-head records==

==Women&#x27;s team==

In December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women&#x27;s Premiership. In March 2018, they were awarded one of four licences for the league&#x27;s inaugural season, to commence in September of the same year. Luisa Avaiki was named the coach of the side.

The team competed in, and finished 3rd place in both the 2018 and 2019 seasons, the latter of which included the first ever standalone NRLW match held at Mount Smart Stadium.

In the 2020 season, because of COVID-19, the team was forced to field a side which only included five players from the previous season, with the rest of the team being Australian players. The team was coached by Jillaroos coach, Brad Donald. The side came in third place (from four) for the third consecutive year.

In June 2021, CEO Cameron George announced the team would not compete in the 2021 competition but plan to re-enter the competition in 2022. This did not eventuate, however, with the NRL announcing NRLW expansion to 10 teams for the 2023 season that did not include the Warriors.

In August 2022, during a Members-Only meeting with CEO Cameron George, Owner Mark Robinson, Coach Stacey Jones, and Captain Tohu Harris. It was announced their intention to re-enter the competition for the 2025 season.

On March 28 2024, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo announced the Warriors would rejoin the NRLW, along with a Canterbury Bulldogs team, in an expanded 12-team competition from 2025.

<text>Carlton is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, three kilometres north of the Melbourne central business district within the City of Melbourne local government area. Carlton recorded a population of 16,055 at the 2021 census.

Immediately adjoining the CBD, Carlton is known nationwide for its Little Italy precinct centred on Lygon Street, for its preponderance of 19th-century Victorian architecture and its garden squares including the Carlton Gardens, the latter being the location of the Royal Exhibition Building, one of Australia&#x27;s few man-made sites with World Heritage status.

Due to its proximity to the University of Melbourne, the CBD campus of RMIT University and the Fitzroy campus of Australian Catholic University, Carlton is also home to one of the highest concentrations of university students in Australia.

==History==
Carlton was founded in 1851, at the beginning of the Victorian Gold Rush, with the Carlton Post Office opening on 19 October 1865. The suburb was named after Carlton House, the Westminster residence of King George IV.

By the 1930s, many homes in Carlton were seen as slums and leased by poor residents.
In 1927, Squizzy Taylor, an Australian gangster, was wounded in a gunfight with rival, John &quot;Snowy&quot; Cutmore, at a house in Barkly Street, Carlton, and later died at St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

In the 1960s, the residents in some parts of the suburb were forced to move from their homes due to redevelopment by the Housing Commission of Victoria. Despite that, a number of areas in Carlton have survived intact. In the 1970s, Carlton was the site of three trade union green bans. One related to an abandoned block where a developer wanted a warehouse but local residents wanted a park, now the Hardy-Gallagher Reserve (named after Labor councillor Fred Hardy and union leader Norm Gallagher). Another allowed a vacant lot in Cardigan street to be turned into a park, and another saved a number of terraced houses from demolition.

The Carlton Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

==Urban structure==
===Housing===

Carlton is characterized by medium- to high-density housing, with a mix of apartments and student accommodation, attached and semidetached terraces mostly from the Victorian era and mix-use buildings 

As of 2021, apartments (80.7%) remain the most common form of housing. Carlton&#x27;s apartments are low incomes, including crisis and student accommodation, with Housing Commission of Victoria towers and modern student apartment buildings. The two main housing commission estates are between Lygon and Rathdowne Streets, and between Nicholson and Canning Streets. These are configured as a mixture of 4 and 5-storey walk-up flats and 22-storey high-rise towers which are in the process of being redeveloped as mixed-tenure housing. 72.3% of Carlton&#x27;s housing is rented, the vast majority of which is concentrated in these apartment towers. The development of new apartment buildings to accommodate international student market since the late 1990s has transformed the once low-rise skyline of Swanston Street, so that its predominant height is about 10–11 storeys. Some strata-titled apartments are clustered fronting suburb&#x27;s parks and gardens.

Semi-detached housing makes up most of the remaining occupied private dwellings (17.1%). Much of this type of housing is the suburb&#x27;s remaining stock of terrace houses which proliferated in the Victorian era. Today these homes are highly sought after, attract high prices and have been the primary of gentrification. Many are contained within heritage overlays and have individual heritage listings. Some of the best examples of this style can be found on Drummond Street, a long wide boulevard flanked by grand homes, including Rosaville (no46 built 1883), Drummond Terrace (no 93-105 built 1890–91), Lothian Terrace (no175-179 built 1865–69), Terraces at 313&amp;315 (1889). Though many terraces in Carlton no longer function as residences and have either been converted for mixed-use or facaded as part of larger developments.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 Carlton reported a median house price of A$620,000 for a two bedroom unit.

===Public spaces===

Carlton&#x27;s public spaces were planned in the Victorian era and notably are all garden squares. These are rectilinear green spaces surrounded by buildings, based on a model fashionable in Europe. There are five main garden squares within the suburb – Carlton Gardens, University Square, Lincoln Square, Argyle Place and MacArthur Place.

The largest of these squares is the 26 hectare Carlton Gardens, planned for the World Exhibition.

Lincoln Square on Swanston Street has a Bali Memorial, commemorating the victims of the 2002 Bali bombings officially opened on 12 October 2005, the third anniversary of the explosion that killed 202 innocent people, including 88 Australians.

The northern part of Argyle Square, adjacent to Lygon Street, has been redeveloped into an Italian style piazza, known as Piazza Italia, in a joint project between the City of Melbourne and its twin city, Milan. A giant sundial is the main feature of the piazza.

==Little Italy==

Little Italy, Melbourne, also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Italian Precinct&quot; or simply &quot;Lygon Street&quot;, is a &quot;Little Italy&quot; cultural precinct centred around Lygon Street in Carlton.

Lygon Street is home to a large concentration of Italian restaurants, and is the birthplace of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;café culture&quot;.

==Culture==
===Arts===

The famous La Mama Theatre is located in Carlton. It is noted for its energy, which is typical of the early Australian theatre scene in the 1970s. Besides that, Cinema Nova on Lygon Street shows many Australian and international art-house films, while Readings Bookstore has been a hub for literary and musical connoisseurs since the 1970s.

Ray Lawler&#x27;s seminal 1955 play &quot;Summer of the Seventeenth Doll&quot; is set in a Carlton terrace. The 1977 cult-classic novel &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; by Helen Garner is also set in Carlton and its surrounds.

===Landmarks and heritage===

Carlton is home to some of Melbourne&#x27;s most historically significant buildings such as Melbourne Trades Hall and the World Heritage Site of the Carlton Gardens, the Royal Exhibition Building and the ruins of the old Carlton Brewery, a collection of buildings constructed between 1864 and 1927, all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Carlton Gardens are also home to the Melbourne Museum.

Carlton has many 19th century public buildings. The Carlton Club, which was built in 1889 by Inskip &amp; Robertson, is notable for its decorative Australian native kangaroo gargoyles and polychrome Florentine arches. The Carlton Post Office and Police Station are both fine Renaissance Revival styled buildings. The Carlton Court House on Drummond Street was designed in the Gothic style by G.B.H Austin and constructed between 1888 and 1889. The Lygon Buildings on Lygon Street were built in 1888 in the Mannerist style. Carlton Gardens Primary School, on Rathdowne Street, opened in 1884. The Police Station (no330 built 1878), Court House (no345-355 built 1887–88) and Medley Hall (no48 built 1892–93) are other notable heritage buildings.

===Sport===
Carlton is the home of the Carlton Football Club, an Australian rules football club that competes in the Australian Football League. Known commonly as the &quot;Bluebaggers&quot; or &quot;Blues&quot;, the club are headquartered and train at their former home ground, the Princes Park Football Ground, in nearby Carlton North. The club splits its home games between the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Marvel Stadium.

Lygon Street, Grattan Street and Queensberry Street were part of the route of the marathon in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which was hosted in Melbourne. Lygon and Cardigan Streets are part of the seventh course of the annual cycling tour, Jayco Herald Sun Tour.

==Economy and commerce==

Lygon Street, which runs through the heart of Carlton, is a centre of Italian culture and cuisine. It is popular among Melburnians and foreigners alike for its numerous restaurants, especially Italian restaurants. Lygon Street is also home to coffee roasters, brunch cafes, pubs, rooftop bars, specialist gelaterias, and several continental cake cafes.

Although Lygon Street is most renowned for its cafes and restaurants, it is also home to some notable retail stores including Readings bookstore and Cinema Nova. 

==Demographics==
In the 2021 census, there were 16,055 people in Carlton.

39.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China (14.0%), India (5.0%), Malaysia (3.9%), England (2.1%) and Vietnam (2.0%)

46.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other top languages spoken at home included Mandarin (16.6%), Cantonese (3.3%), Vietnamese (2.3%), Somali (2.0%) and Spanish (1.9%)

The most common responses for religion was No Religion (51.6%), Catholic (11.4%), Islam (7.1%) and Buddhism (6.0%).

The area is noted for its diverse population that has been the home in earlier days of Jewish and Italian immigrants. A large number of low-income residents live in the substantial public housing estates that were built during the 1960s.

Carlton also has a sizable tertiary student population, both local and international, due to its proximity to the University of Melbourne and RMIT University. 72.7% of Carlton residents were attending a tertiary educational institution.

==Politics==

Carlton falls within the federal electorate of Melbourne (currently held by Adam Bandt of The Greens) and the state electorate of Melbourne (currently held by Ellen Sandell of The Greens).

A traditional working-class suburb, it traditionally saw a high vote for the ALP. However, like many other inner-city suburbs undergoing a process of gentrification, the Greens have been gaining an increasing share of the vote.

The suburb contains three polling booths (Carlton, Carlton Central and Carlton South), which collectively produced the following primary-vote results at the 2019 federal election: Greens 2534 or 62.58%; Labor 668 or 16.5%; Liberal 605 or 14.94%; Reason 212 or 5.24% and United Australia 30 or 0.74%.

==Education==
Due to Carlton&#x27;s close proximity to the Parkville campus of the University of Melbourne, many university-owned buildings can be found around Carlton, as a result of the university&#x27;s expansion through the years. This includes the University Square redevelopment, where the state-of-the-art Law and ICT buildings and a new underground carpark are located. However, the university&#x27;s continued expansion into Carlton is opposed by some residents. Two of the university&#x27;s residential colleges are located in Carlton; Medley Hall is located on Drummond Street, while Graduate House is on Leicester Street. Graduate House is a residential college for graduate students only and does not admit any undergraduate students.

Melbourne Business School, Melbourne Law School and part of RMIT University&#x27;s City Campus are also located in Carlton.Victoria and Tasmania&#x27;s Catholic seminary, Corpus Christi College, is located on Drummond Street. The college accommodates forty seminarians who are studying to become priests.

Primary education is provided by two schools; Carlton Gardens Primary School and Carlton Primary School. CGPS was founded in 1884 and is one of Melbourne&#x27;s oldest schools and the closest to the Melbourne CBD.

The Melbourne University Regiment (MUR) is based in Grattan Street, Carlton. MUR serves to train potential officers in the Australian Army Reserve. MUR was founded in 1884 as D company, 4th Battalion of the Victorian Rifles, and changed to its current name and role in 1948. Famous alumni include Sir John Monash, Sir Robert Menzies, Sir Ninian Stephen, Barry Humphries, and Andrew Peacock.

==Health==
Carlton is well serviced by the health sector. The Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital and the new Royal Dental Hospital provide high quality health care. It is also a centre of biomedical research. The Cancer Research Institute and the Australian College of Optometry all have their premises in Carlton. Carlton is the home of NETS (Victoria) which provides emergency transport of sick newborns between hospitals throughout Victoria and from Tasmania. It was also the home of Cancer Council Victoria for many years before it moved to St Kilda Road.

==Places of worship==

There are a number of churches in Carlton, which serve the spiritual needs of Carlton residents. St Jude&#x27;s Church, on Lygon Street, is one of the most active and well attended Anglican churches in the Greater Melbourne area. 

Other churches in the area include the bluestone Church of All Nations (a Uniting Church) in Palmerston Street dating from 1860, a Romanian Orthodox Church on Queensberry Street, a Salvation Army Church, the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Chinese Church of Christ and the Christian Chapel of the Church of Christ, built in 1865. 

The Catholic seminary is located on the site of St George&#x27;s Catholic Church, Carlton&#x27;s oldest surviving building, dating from 1855. The Albanian Mosque, Melbourne&#x27;s oldest mosque is also located on Drummond Street in neighbouring Carlton North.

==Transport==

Carlton is served by many of Melbourne&#x27;s tram routes, running along Swanston Street and terminating at Melbourne University. Routes 1 and 6 continue through to Carlton North and beyond via Lygon Street.

Buses serve Carlton via Lygon, Elgin, and Rathdowne Streets. There are currently no trains to Carlton, with the closest station being Melbourne Central. There were talks and proposals of extending the City Loop to service Carlton, but no concrete plans have been proposed.

Rod Eddington&#x27;s East West Link Needs Assessment does mention however, that there will be subway(s) in Carlton, as a part of the proposed 17 km Metro Tunnel.

<text>Hindu temple architecture as the main form of Hindu architecture has many different styles, though the basic nature of the Hindu temple remains the same, with the essential feature an inner sanctum, the &quot;garbha griha&quot; or womb-chamber, where the primary &quot;Murti&quot; or the image of a deity is housed in a simple bare cell. For rituals and prayers, this chamber frequently has an open space that can be moved in a clockwise direction. There are frequently additional buildings and structures in the vicinity of this chamber, with the largest ones covering several acres. On the exterior, the garbhagriha is crowned by a tower-like &quot;shikhara&quot;, also called the &quot;vimana&quot; in the south. &quot;Gopuram&quot; gateways are elaborate in the south. The shrine building often includes an circumambulatory passage for parikrama, a mandapa congregation hall, and sometimes an antarala antechamber and porch between garbhagriha and mandapa. In addition to other small temples in the compound, there may be additional mandapas or buildings that are either connected or separate from the larger temples.

Hindu temple architecture reflects a synthesis of arts, the ideals of dharma, values, and the way of life cherished under Hinduism. The temple is a place for &quot;Tirtha&quot;—pilgrimage. All the cosmic elements that create and celebrate life in Hindu pantheon, are present in a Hindu temple—from fire to water, from images of nature to deities, from the feminine to the masculine, from kama to artha, from the fleeting sounds and incense smells to Purusha—the eternal nothingness yet universality—is part of a Hindu temple architecture. The form and meanings of architectural elements in a Hindu temple are designed to function as a place in which to create a link between man and the divine, to help his progress to spiritual knowledge and truth, his liberation it calls moksha.

The architectural principles of Hindu temples in India are described in the Shilpa Shastras and Vastu Sastras. The Hindu culture has encouraged aesthetic independence to its temple builders, and its architects have sometimes exercised considerable flexibility in creative expression by adopting other perfect geometries and mathematical principles in &quot;Mandir&quot; construction to express the Hindu Way of life.

Hindu temple architecture and its various styles has had a profound influence on the stylistic origins of Buddhist architecture. Aspects seen on Buddhist architecture like the stupa may have been influenced by the shikhara, a stylistic element which in some regions evolved to the pagoda which are seen throughout Thailand, Cambodia, Nepal, China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Myanmar, and Vietnam.

==History==
===Early structures===

Remains of early elliptical shrines discovered in Besnagar (3rd-2nd century BCE) and Nagari (1st century BCE), may be the earliest known Hindu temple structures, associated to the early Bhagavata tradition, a precursor of Vaishnavism. In Tamil Nadu, the earliest version of the Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam, north-facing and in brick, appears to date from between the 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE.

In Besnagar, the temple structures have been found in conjonction with the Heliodorus pillar dedicated to Vāsudeva. The archaeologists found an ancient elliptical foundation, extensive floor and plinth produced from burnt bricks. Further, the foundations for all the major components of a Hindu temple – &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (sanctum), &quot;pradakshinapatha&quot; (circumambulation passage), &quot;antarala&quot; (antechamber next to sanctum) and &quot;mandapa&quot; (gathering hall) – were found. These sections had a thick support base for their walls. These core temple remains cover an area of 30 x 30 m. The sections had post-holes, which likely contained the wooden pillars for the temple superstructure above. In the soil were iron nails that likely held together the wooden pillars. The superstructure of the temple was likely made of wood, mud and other perishable materials.

The ancient temple complex discovered in Nagari (Chittorgarh, Rajasthan) – about 500 kilometers to the west of Vidisha, has a sub-surface structure nearly identical to that of the Besnagar temple. The structure is also associated to the cult of Vāsudeva and Saṃkarṣaṇa, and dated to the 1st century BCE.

===Classical period (4-6th century)===

Though there are very few remains of stone Hindu temples before the Gupta dynasty in the 5th century CE, there may be earlier structures constructed from timber-based architecture. The rock-cut Udayagiri Caves (401 CE) are among the most important early sites, built with royal sponsorship, recorded by inscriptions, and with impressive sculpture. The earliest preserved Hindu temples are simple cell-like stone temples, some rock-cut and others structural, as at Temple 17 at Sanchi. By the 6th or 7th century, these evolved into high shikhara stone superstructures. However, there is inscriptional evidence such as the ancient Gangadhara inscription from about 424 CE, states Meister, that towering temples existed before this time and these were possibly made from more perishable material. These temples have not survived.

Examples of early major North Indian temples that have survived after the Udayagiri Caves in Madhya Pradesh include those at Tigawa, Deogarh, Parvati Temple, Nachna (465), Bhitargaon, the largest Gupta brick temple to survive, Lakshman Brick Temple, Sirpur (600-625 CE); Rajiv Lochan temple, Rajim (7th-century). Gop Temple in Gujarat (c. 550 or later) is an oddity, with no surviving close comparator.

No pre-7th century CE South Indian free-standing stone temples have survived. Examples of early major South Indian temples that have survived, some in ruins, include the diverse styles at Mahabalipuram, from the 7th and 8th centuries. According to Meister, the Mahabalipuram temples are &quot;monolithic models of a variety of formal structures all of which already can be said to typify a developed &quot;Dravida&quot; (South Indian) order&quot;. They suggest a tradition and a knowledge base existed in South India by the time of the early Chalukya and Pallava era when these were built. In the Deccan, Cave 3 of the Badami cave temples was cut out in 578 CE, and Cave 1 is probably slightly earlier. Other examples are found in Aihole and Pattadakal.

=== Medieval period (7th to 16th century)===

By about the 7th century most main features of the Hindu temple were established along with theoretical texts on temple architecture and building methods. From between about the 7th and 13th centuries a large number of temples and their ruins have survived (though far fewer than once existed). Many regional styles developed, very often following political divisions, as large temples were typically built with royal patronage. The Vesara style originated in the region between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers that is contemporary north Karnataka. According to some art historians, the roots of Vesara style can be traced to the Chalukyas of Badami (500-753AD) whose Early Chalukya or Badami Chalukya architecture built temples in a style that mixed some features of the &quot;nagara&quot; and the &quot;dravida&quot; styles, for example using both the northern shikhara and southern vimana type of superstructure over the sanctum in different temples of similar date, as at Pattadakal. This style was further refined by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (750-983AD) in sites such as Ellora. Though there is clearly a good deal of continuity with the Badami or Early Chalukya style, other writers only date the start of Vesara to the later Western Chalukyas of Kalyani (983-1195 AD), in sites such as Lakkundi, Dambal, Itagi, and Gadag, and continued by the Hoysala empire (1000-1330 AD).

The earliest examples of Pallava architecture are rock-cut temples dating from 610 to 690 CE and structural temples between 690 and 900 CE. The greatest accomplishments of the Pallava architecture are the rock-cut Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including the Shore Temple. This group includes both excavated pillared halls, with no external roof except the natural rock, and monolithic shrines where the natural rock is entirely cut away and carved to give an external roof. Early temples were mostly dedicated to Shiva. The Kailasanatha temple also called Rajasimha Pallaveswaram in Kanchipuram built by Narasimhavarman II also known as Rajasimha is a fine example of the Pallava style temple.

Western Chalukya architecture linked between the Badami Chalukya Architecture of the 8th century and the Hoysala architecture popularised in the 13th century. The art of Western Chalukyas is sometimes called the &quot;Gadag style&quot; after the number of ornate temples they built in the Tungabhadra – Krishna River doab region of present-day Gadag district in Karnataka. Their temple building reached its maturity and culmination in the 12th century, with over a hundred temples built across the deccan, more than half of them in present-day Karnataka. Apart from temples they are also well known for ornate stepped wells (&quot;Pushkarni&quot;) which served as ritual bathing places, many of which are well preserved in Lakkundi. Their stepped well designs were later incorporated by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara empire in the coming centuries.

In the north, Muslim invasions from the 11th century onwards reduced the building of temples, and saw the loss of many existing ones. The south also witnessed Hindu-Muslim conflict that affected the temples, but the region was relatively less affected than the north. In late 14th century, the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire came to power and controlled much of South India. During this period, the distinctive very tall gopuram gatehouse, (actually a late development, from the 12th century or later), was typically added to older large temples.

===Southeast Asian Hindu temples===

Possibly the oldest Hindu temples in Southeast Asia dates back to 2nd century BCE from the Funan site of Oc Eo in the Mekong Delta. They were probably dedicated to a sun god, Shiva and Vishnu. The temple were constructed using granite blocks and bricks, one with a small stepped pond.

The earliest evidence trace to Sanskrit stone inscriptions found on the islands and the mainland Southeast Asia is the Võ Cạnh inscription of Champa dated to 2nd or 3rd century CE in Vietnam or in Cambodia between the 4th and 5th century CE. Prior to the 14th-century local versions of Hindu temples were built in Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. These developed several national traditions, and often mixed Hinduism and Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism prevailed in many parts of the South-East Asia, except Malaysia and Indonesia where Islam displaced them both.

Hindu temples in Southeast Asia developed their own distinct versions, mostly based on Indian architectural models, both North Indian and South Indian styles. However, the Southeast Asian temple architecture styles are different, and there is no known single temple in India that can be the source of the Southeast Asian temples. According to Michell, it is as if the Southeast Asian architects learned from &quot;the theoretical prescriptions about temple building&quot; from Indian texts, but never saw one. They reassembled the elements with their own creative interpretations. The Hindu temples found in Southeast Asia are more conservative and far more strongly link the Mount Meru-related cosmological elements of Indian thought than the Hindu temples found in the subcontinent. Additionally, unlike the Indian temples, the sacred architecture in Southeast Asia associated the ruler (devaraja) with the divine, with the temple serving as a memorial to the king as much as being house of gods. Notable examples of Southeast Asian Hindu temple architecture are the Shivaist Prambanan Trimurti temple compound in Java, Indonesia (9th century), and the Vishnuite Angkor Wat in Cambodia (12th century).

==Design==

A Hindu temple is a symmetry-driven structure, with many variations, on a square grid of &quot;padas&quot;, depicting perfect geometric shapes such as circles and squares. Susan Lewandowski states that the underlying principle in a Hindu temple is built around the belief that all things are one and that everything is connected. A temple, states Lewandowski, &quot;replicates again and again the Hindu beliefs in the parts mirroring, and at the same time &quot;being&quot;, the universal whole&quot; like an &quot;organism of repeating cells&quot;. The pilgrim is welcomed through mathematically structured spaces, a network of art, pillars with carvings and statues that display and celebrate the four important and necessary principles of human life—the pursuit of artha (prosperity, wealth), the pursuit of kama (desire), the pursuit of dharma (virtues, ethical life) and the pursuit of moksha (release, self-knowledge).

At the centre of the temple, typically below and sometimes above or next to the deity, is mere hollow space with no decoration, symbolically representing &quot;Purusa&quot;, the Supreme Principle, the sacred Universal, one without form, which is present everywhere, connects everything, and is the essence of everyone. A Hindu temple is meant to encourage reflection, facilitate purification of one&#x27;s mind, and trigger the process of inner realization within the devotee. The specific process is left to the devotee&#x27;s school of belief. The primary deity of different Hindu temples varies to reflect this spiritual spectrum.

===The site===
The appropriate site for a Mandir, suggest ancient Sanskrit texts, is near water and gardens, where lotus and flowers bloom, where swans, ducks and other birds are heard, where animals rest without fear of injury or harm. These harmonious places were recommended in these texts with the explanation that such are the places where gods play, and thus the best site for Hindu temples.

While major Hindu mandirs are recommended at sangams (confluence of rivers), river banks, lakes and seashore, the &quot;Brhat Samhita&quot; and &quot;Puranas&quot; suggest temples may also be built where a natural source of water is not present. Here too, they recommend that a pond be built preferably in front or to the left of the temple with water gardens. If water is neither present naturally nor by design, water is symbolically present at the consecration of temple or the deity. Temples may also be built, suggests &quot;Visnudharmottara&quot; in Part III of Chapter 93, inside caves and carved stones, on hill tops affording peaceful views, mountain slopes overlooking beautiful valleys, inside forests and hermitages, next to gardens, or at the head of a town street.

In practice most temples are built as part of a village or town. Some sites such as the capitals of kingdoms and those considered particularly favourable in terms of sacred geography had numerous temples. Many ancient capitals vanished and the surviving temples are now found in a rural landscape; often these are the best-preserved examples of older styles. Aihole, Badami, Pattadakal and Gangaikonda Cholapuram are examples.

===The plan===

The design, especially the floor plan, of the part of a Hindu temple around the sanctum or shrine follows a geometrical design called &quot;vastu-purusha-mandala&quot;. The name is a composite Sanskrit word with three of the most important components of the plan. &quot;Mandala&quot; means circle, &quot;Purusha&quot; is universal essence at the core of Hindu tradition, while &quot;Vastu&quot; means the dwelling structure. Vastupurushamandala is a yantra. The design lays out a Hindu temple in a symmetrical, self-repeating structure derived from central beliefs, myths, cardinality and mathematical principles.

The four cardinal directions help create the axis of a Hindu temple, around which is formed a perfect square in the space available. The circle of mandala circumscribes the square. The square is considered divine for its perfection and as a symbolic product of knowledge and human thought, while circle is considered earthly, human and observed in everyday life (moon, sun, horizon, water drop, rainbow). Each supports the other. The square is divided into perfect square grids. In large temples, this is often a 8×8 or 64-grid structure. In ceremonial temple superstructures, this is an 81 sub-square grid. The squares are called ‘‘padas’’. The square is symbolic and has Vedic origins from fire altar, Agni. The alignment along cardinal direction, similarly is an extension of Vedic rituals of three fires. This symbolism is also found among Greek and other ancient civilizations, through the gnomon. In Hindu temple manuals, design plans are described with 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 up to 1024 squares; 1 pada is considered the simplest plan, as a seat for a hermit or devotee to sit and meditate on, do yoga, or make offerings with Vedic fire in front. The second design of 4 padas has a symbolic central core at the diagonal intersection, and is also a meditative layout. The 9 pada design has a sacred surrounded centre, and is the template for the smallest temple. Older Hindu temple vastumandalas may use the 9 through 49 pada series, but 64 is considered the most sacred geometric grid in Hindu temples. It is also called Manduka, Bhekapada or Ajira in various ancient Sanskrit texts. Each pada is conceptually assigned to a symbolic element, sometimes in the form of a deity or to a spirit or apasara. The central square(s) of the 64 is dedicated to the Brahman (not to be confused with Brahmin), and are called Brahma padas.

In a Hindu temple&#x27;s structure of symmetry and concentric squares, each concentric layer has significance. The outermost layer, Paisachika padas, signify aspects of Asuras and evil; the next inner concentric layer is Manusha padas signifying human life; while Devika padas signify aspects of Devas and good. The Manusha padas typically houses the ambulatory. The devotees, as they walk around in clockwise fashion through this ambulatory to complete Parikrama (or Pradakshina), walk between good on inner side and evil on the outer side. In smaller temples, the Paisachika pada is not part of the temple superstructure, but may be on the boundary of the temple or just symbolically represented.

The Paisachika padas, Manusha padas and Devika padas surround Brahma padas, which signifies creative energy and serves as the location for temple&#x27;s primary idol for darsana. Finally at the very centre of Brahma padas is &quot;Garbhagruha&quot;(&quot;Garbha&quot;- Centre, &quot;gruha&quot;- house; literally the centre of the house) (Purusa Space), signifying Universal Principle present in everything and everyone. The spire of a Hindu temple, called Shikhara in north India and Vimana in south India, is perfectly aligned above the Brahma pada(s).
Beneath the mandala&#x27;s central square(s) is the space for the formless shapeless all pervasive all connecting Universal Spirit, the Purusha. This space is sometimes referred to as &quot;garbha-griya&quot; (literally womb house) – a small, perfect square, windowless, enclosed space without ornamentation that represents universal essence. In or near this space is typically a murti. This is the main deity image, and this varies with each temple. Often it is this idol that gives it a local name, such as Vishnu temple, Krishna temple, Rama temple, Narayana temple, Siva temple, Lakshmi temple, Ganesha temple, Durga temple, Hanuman temple, Surya temple, and others. It is this garbha-griya which devotees seek for ‘‘darsana’’ (literally, a sight of knowledge, or vision).

Above the vastu-purusha-mandala is a high superstructure called the &quot;shikhara&quot; in north India, and &quot;vimana&quot; in south India, that stretches towards the sky. Sometimes, in makeshift temples, the superstructure may be replaced with symbolic bamboo with few leaves at the top. The vertical dimension&#x27;s cupola or dome is designed as a pyramid, conical or other mountain-like shape, once again using principle of concentric circles and squares (see below). Scholars such as Lewandowski state that this shape is inspired by cosmic mountain of Mount Meru or Himalayan Kailasa, the abode of gods according to its ancient mythology.
In larger temples, the outer three padas are visually decorated with carvings, paintings or images meant to inspire the devotee. In some temples, these images or wall reliefs may be stories from Hindu Epics, in others they may be Vedic tales about right and wrong or virtues and vice, in some they may be idols of minor or regional deities. The pillars, walls and ceilings typically also have highly ornate carvings or images of the four just and necessary pursuits of life—kama, artha, dharma, and moksa. This walk around is called &quot;pradakshina&quot;.

Large temples also have pillared halls called mandapa. One on the east side, serves as the waiting room for pilgrims and devotees. The mandapa may be a separate structure in older temples, but in newer temples this space is integrated into the temple superstructure. Mega temple sites have a main temple surrounded by smaller temples and shrines, but these are still arranged by principles of symmetry, grids and mathematical precision. An important principle found in the layout of Hindu temples is mirroring and repeating fractal-like design structure, each unique yet also repeating the central common principle, one which Susan Lewandowski refers to as “an organism of repeating cells”.

;Exceptions to the square grid principle
Predominant number of Hindu temples exhibit the perfect square grid principle. However, there are some exceptions. For example, the Teli ka Mandir in Gwalior, built in the 8th century CE is not a square but is a rectangle consisting of stacked squares. Further, the temple explores a number of structures and shrines in 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:5, 3:5 and 4:5 ratios. These ratios are exact, suggesting the architect intended to use these harmonic ratios, and the rectangle pattern was not a mistake, nor an arbitrary approximation. Other examples of non-square harmonic ratios are found at Naresar temple site of Madhya Pradesh and Nakti-Mata temple near Jaipur, Rajasthan. Michael Meister states that these exceptions mean the ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple building were guidelines, and Hinduism permitted its artisans flexibility in expression and aesthetic independence.

The Hindu text &quot;Sthapatya Veda&quot; describes many plans and styles of temples of which the following are found in other derivative literature: &quot;Chaturasra&quot; (square), &quot;Ashtasra&quot; (octagonal), &quot;Vritta&quot; (circular), &quot;Ayatasra&quot; (rectangular), &quot;Ayata Ashtasra&quot; (rectangular-octagonal fusion), &quot;Ayata Vritta&quot; (elliptical), &quot;Hasti Prishta&quot; (apsidal), &quot;Dvayasra Vrita&quot; (rectangular-circular fusion); in Tamil literature, the &quot;Prana Vikara&quot; (shaped like a Tamil Om sign, ) is also found. Methods of combining squares and circles to produce all of these plans are described in the Hindu texts.

==The builders==
The temples were built by guilds of architects, artisans and workmen. Their knowledge and craft traditions, states Michell, were originally preserved by the oral tradition, later with palm-leaf manuscripts. The building tradition was typically transmitted within families from one generation to the next, and this knowledge was jealously guarded. The guilds were like a corporate body that set rules of work and standard wages. These guilds over time became wealthy, and themselves made charitable donations as evidenced by inscriptions. The guilds covered almost every aspect of life in the camps around the site where the workmen lived during the period of construction, which in the case of large projects might be several years.

The work was led by a chief architect (&quot;sutradhara&quot;). The construction superintendent was equal in his authority. Other important members were stonemason chief and the chief image-maker who collaborated to complete a temple. The sculptors were called &quot;shilpins&quot;. Women participated in temple building, but in lighter work such as polishing stones and clearing. Hindu texts are inconsistent about which caste did the construction work, with some texts accepting all castes to work as a &quot;shilpin&quot;. The &quot;Brahmins&quot; were the experts in art theory and guided the workmen when needed. They also performed consecration rituals of the superstructure and in the sanctum.

In the earliest periods of Hindu art, from about the 4th century to about the 10th century, the artists had considerable freedom and this is evidenced in the considerable variations and innovations in images crafted and temple designs. Later, much of this freedom was lost as iconography became more standardized and the demand for iconometry consistency increased. This &quot;presumably reflected the influence of Brahman theologians&quot; states Michell, and the &quot;increasing dependence of the artist upon the brahmins&quot; on suitable forms of sacred images. The &quot;individual pursuit of self-expression&quot; in a temple project was not allowed and instead, the artist expressed the sacred values in the visual form through a temple, for the most part anonymously.
The sponsors used contracts for the building tasks. Though great masters probably had assistants to help complete principal images in a temple, the reliefs panels in a Hindu temple were &quot;almost certainly the inspiration of a single artist&quot;.

===Schools of temple building tradition===
Along with guilds, surviving texts suggest that several schools of Hindu temple architecture had developed in ancient India. Each school developed its own gurukuls (study centres) and texts. Of these, state Bharne and Krusche, two became most prominent: the Vishwakarma school and the Maya (Devanagari: मय not to be pronounced as Maayaa) school. The Vishwakarma school is credited with treatises, terminology and innovations related to the Nagara style of architecture, while the Maya school with those related to the Dravida style. The style now called Vesara bridges and combines elements of the Nagara and the Dravida styles, it probably reflects one of the other extinct schools.

Some scholars have questioned the relevance of these texts, whether the artists relied on &quot;śilpa śāstras&quot; theory and Sanskrit construction manuals probably written by Brahmins, and did these treatises precede or follow the big temples and ancient sculptures therein. Other scholars question whether big temples and complex symmetric architecture or sculpture with consistent themes and common iconography across distant sites, over many centuries, could have been built by artists and architects without adequate theory, shared terminology and tools, and if so how. According to Adam Hardy – an architecture historian and professor of Asian Architecture, the truth &quot;must lie somewhere in between&quot;. According to George Michell – an art historian and professor specializing in Hindu Architecture, the theory and the creative field practice likely co-evolved, and the construction workers and artists building complex temples likely consulted the theoreticians when they needed to.

==Various styles of architecture==
The ancient Hindu texts on architecture such as &quot;Brihatsamhita&quot; and others, states Michell, classify temples into five orders based on their typological features: Nagara, Dravida, Vesara, ellipse and rectangle. The plan described for each include square, octagonal and apsidal. Their horizontal plan regulates the vertical form. Each temple architecture in turn has developed its own vocabulary, with terms that overlap but do not necessarily mean exactly the same thing in another style and may apply to a different part of the temple. Following a general historical division, the early Hindu temples, up to the 7th or 8th century, are often called classical or ancient temples, while those after the classical period to the 12th or 13th century are sometimes referred to as medieval. However, this division does not reflect a major break in Hindu architecture, which continued to evolve gradually across these periods.

The style of Hindu temple architecture is not only the result of the theology, spiritual ideas, and the early Hindu texts but also a result of innovation driven by regional availability of raw materials and the local climate. Some materials of construction were imported from distant regions, but much of the temples were built from readily available materials. In some regions, such as in South Karnataka, the local availability of soft stone led to Hoysala architects to innovate architectural styles that are difficult with hard crystalline rocks. In other places, artists used to cut granite or other stones to build temples and create sculptures. Rock faces allowed artists to carve cave temples or a region&#x27;s rocky terrain encouraged monolithic rock-cut temple architecture. In regions where stones were unavailable, brick temples flourished. Hindu temple architecture has historically been affected by the building material available in each region, its &quot;tonal value, texture and structural possibilities&quot; states Michell.

===India ===
====Dravidian architecture====


Dravidian architecture is an architectural idiom in Hindu temple architecture that emerged from South India, reaching its final form by the 1500 CE. It is seen in Hindu temples, and the most distinctive difference from north Indian styles is the use of a shorter and more pyramidal tower over the garbhagriha or sanctuary called a vimana, where the north has taller towers, usually bending inwards as they rise, called shikhara. However, for modern visitors to larger temples the dominating feature is the high Gopura or gatehouse at the edge of the compound; large temples have several, dwarfing the vimana; these are a much more recent development. There are numerous other distinct features such as the &quot;dvarapalakas&quot; – twin guardians at the main entrance and the inner sanctum of the temple and &quot;goshtams&quot; – deities carved in niches on the outer side walls of the garbhagriha.

Mentioned as one of three styles of temple building in the ancient book Vastu shastra, the majority of the existing structures are located in the Southern Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, some parts of Maharashtra, Odisha and Sri Lanka. Various kingdoms and empires such as the Satavahanas, the Vakatakas of Vidarbha, the Cholas, the Chera, the Kakatiyas, the Reddis, the Pandyas, the Pallavas, the Gangas, the Kadambas, the Rashtrakutas, the Chalukyas, the Hoysalas and Vijayanagara Empire among others have made substantial contribution to the evolution of the Dravida architecture.

==== Dravida and Nagara architecture ====
Of the different styles of temple architecture in India, the Nagara architecture of northern India and the Dravidian architecture of southern India are most common. Other styles are also found. For example, the rainy climate and the materials of construction available in Bengal, Kerala, Java and Bali Indonesia have influenced the evolutions of styles and structures in these regions. At other sites such as Ellora and Pattadakal, adjacent temples may have features drawing from different traditions, as well as features in a common style local to that region and period. In modern era literature, many styles have been named after the royal dynasties in whose territories they were built.

====Regional styles====
The architecture of the rock-cut temples, particularly the &quot;rathas&quot;, became a model for south Indian temples. Architectural features, particularly the sculptures, were widely adopted in South Indian, Cambodian, Annamese and Javanese temples. Descendants of the sculptors of the shrines are artisans in contemporary Mahabalipuram.

=====Badami Chalukya architecture=====
The Badami Chalukya Architecture style originated by 5th century in Aihole and was perfected in Pattadakal and Badami.

Between 500 and 757 CE, Badami Chalukyas built Hindu temples out of sandstone cut into enormous blocks from the outcrops in the chains of the Kaladgi hills.

In Aihole, known as the &quot;Cradle of Indian architecture,&quot; there are over 150 temples scattered around the village. The Lad Khan Temple is the oldest. The Durga Temple is notable for its semi-circular apse, elevated plinth and the gallery that encircles the sanctum sanctorum. A sculpture of Vishnu sitting atop a large cobra is at Hutchimali Temple. The Ravalphadi cave temple celebrates the many forms of Shiva. Other temples include the Konthi temple complex and the Meguti Jain temple.

Pattadakal is a World Heritage Site, where one finds the Virupaksha temple; it is the biggest temple, having carved scenes from the great epics of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Other temples at Pattadakal are Mallikarjuna, Kashivishwanatha, Galaganatha and Papanath.

===== Bengal temple architecture =====

Several styles of temple architecture developed in Bengal. Notable temple architectural styles of Bengal are the &quot;Chala&quot;, &quot;Ratna&quot; and &quot;Dalan&quot; temples. &quot;Chala-style&quot; is a hut with a sloping roof, which follows the pattern of huts in most villages of Bengal. &quot;Ratna-style&quot; originated in Bengal from the 15th to 16th centuries, under the Mallabhum kingdom (also called Malla dynasty). One of the most prominent features of the &quot;Chala&quot; and &quot;Ratna&quot; style is the terracotta artwork on the temple walls. The &quot;Dalan-style&quot; is flat-roofed temples with their heavy cornices on S-curved brackets, and this style was later influenced by European ideas in the 19th century.

The prominent examples of &quot;Chala-style&quot; are Siddheshwari Kali Temple of Kalna City and Palpara Terracotta Temple of Palpara. One of the prominent example of &quot;Ratna-style&quot; is Ramchandraji temple at Guptipara. The Sharabhuja Gauranga temple at Panchrol is an example of &quot;Dalan-style&quot;.

=====Gadag architecture=====

The Gadag style of architecture is also called Western Chalukya architecture. The style flourished for 150 years (1050 to 1200 CE); in this period, about 50 temples were built. Some examples are the Saraswati temple in the Trikuteshwara temple complex at Gadag, the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal, the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, and the Amriteshwara temple at Annigeri. which is marked by ornate pillars with intricate sculpture. This style originated during the period of the Kalyani Chalukyas (also known as Western Chalukya) Someswara I.

=====Kalinga architecture=====

The design which flourished in eastern Indian state of Odisha and Northern Andhra Pradesh are called Kalinga style of architecture. The style consists of three distinct type of temples namely &quot;Rekha Deula&quot;, &quot;Pidha Deula&quot; and &quot;Khakhara Deula&quot;. Deula means &quot;temple&quot; in the Odia language. The former two are associated with Vishnu, Surya and Shiva temple while the third is mainly with Chamunda and Durga temples. The Rekha deula and Khakhara deula houses the sanctum sanctorum while the Pidha Deula constitutes outer dancing and offering halls.

The prominent examples of Rekha Deula are Lingaraja Temple of Bhubaneswar and Jagannath Temple of Puri. One of the prominent example of Khakhara Deula is Vaital Deula. The Mukhasala structure that remains of the Konark Sun Temple is an example of Pidha Deula.

=====Māru-Gurjara architecture=====
Māru-Gurjara architecture, or Solaṅkī style, is a style of north Indian temple architecture that originated in Gujarat and Rajasthan from the 11th to 13th centuries, under the Chaulukya dynasty (or Solaṅkī dynasty). Although originating as a regional style in Hindu temple architecture, it became especially popular in Jain temples and, mainly under Jain patronage, later spread across India and to diaspora communities around the world.

On the exteriors, the style is distinguished from other north Indian temple styles of the period in &quot;that the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of moldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and kīrttimukhas. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.&quot; The main shikhara tower usually has many &quot;urushringa&quot; subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples. 

Interiors are if anything even more lavishly decorated, with elaborate carving on most surfaces. In particular, Jain temples often have small low domes carved on the inside with a highly intricate rosette design. Another distinctive feature is &quot;flying&quot; arch-like elements between pillars, touching the horizontal beam above in the centre, and elaborately carved. These have no structural function, and are purely decorative. The style developed large pillared halls, many open at the sides, with Jain temples often having one closed and two pillared halls in sequence on the main axis leading to the shrine. 
The style mostly fell from use in Hindu temples in its original regions by the 13th century, especially as the area had fallen to the Muslim Delhi Sultanate by 1298. But, unusually for an Indian temple style, it continued to be used by Jains there and elsewhere, with a notable &quot;revival&quot; in the 15th century. Since then it has continued in use in Jain and some Hindu temples, and from the late 20th century has spread to temples built outside India by both the Jain diaspora and Hindus. Some buildings mix Māru-Gurjara elements with those of local temple styles and modern international ones. Generally, where there is elaborate carving, often still done by craftsmen from Gujarat or Rajasthan, this has more ornamental and decorative work than small figures. In particular the style is used in India and abroad by the Swaminarayan sect. Sometimes the Māru-Gurjara influence is limited to the &quot;flying arches&quot; and mandapa ceiling rosettes, and a preference for white marble.

=== Nepal ===

==== Newar architecture ====
This style is one of the oldest styles of temples on the Asian continent and derives its shape from Himalayan fir trees. The ground floor is typically the residence of the deity, either Hindu or Buddhist, while the upper floors are used as storage for religious items. There is &quot;gajura&quot; at the top which is the combination of a lotus base, an upside-down vase, a triangle and a kalasha. The pagoda style flourished in Nepal from the beginning of the 13th century. The temples of Pashupatinath, Changunarayan, Chandeshwori and Banepa are excellent examples of ancient architecture in the pagoda style. The Malla period produced various pagoda-style temples and palaces such as Nayatapola, Dattatraya of Bhaktapur, Kasthamandap of Kathmandu, Taleju Temple, Vajrabarahi, Vajrayogini.

===Southeast Asia as part of Greater India===
Architecture of the southeast nations was inspired by the Indian temple architecture, as those were Indianised as part of the Greater India.

====Champa architecture====

Between the 6th and the 16th century, the Kingdom of Champa flourished in present-day central and southern Vietnam. Unlike the Javanese that mostly used volcanic andesite stone for their temples, and Khmer of Angkor which mostly employed grey sandstones to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish bricks. The most important remaining sites of Cham bricks temple architecture include Mỹ Sơn near Da Nang, Po Nagar near Nha Trang, and Po Klong Garai near Phan Rang.

Typically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings. They are &quot;kalan&quot;, a brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower with &quot;garbahgriha&quot; used to host the murti of deity. A &quot;mandapa&quot; is an entry hallway connected with a sanctuary. A &quot;kosagrha&quot; or &quot;fire-house&quot; is a temple construction typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity. The &quot;gopura&quot; was a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex. These building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of Greater India.

====Indonesian architecture====

Temples are called &quot;candi&quot; () in Indonesia, whether it is Buddhist or Hindu. A candi refers to a structure based on the Indian type of single-celled shrine, with a pyramidal tower above it (Meru tower in Bali), and a portico for entrance, mostly built between the 7th to 15th centuries. In Hindu Balinese architecture, a &quot;candi&quot; shrine can be found within a &quot;pura&quot; compound. The best example of Indonesian Javanese Hindu temple architecture is the 9th century Prambanan (Shivagrha) temple compound, located in Central Java, near Yogyakarta. This largest Hindu temple in Indonesia has three main prasad towers, dedicated to Trimurti gods. Shiva temple, the largest main temple is towering to 47 metre-high (154 ft).

The term &quot;candi&quot; itself is believed was derived from &quot;Candika&quot;, one of the manifestations of the goddess Durga as the goddess of death.

The &quot;candi&quot; architecture follows the typical Hindu architecture traditions based on Vastu Shastra. The temple layout, especially in central Java period, incorporated mandala temple plan arrangements and also the typical high towering spires of Hindu temples. The candi was designed to mimic Meru, the holy mountain the abode of gods. The whole temple is a model of Hindu universe according to Hindu cosmology and the layers of Loka.

The &quot;candi&quot; structure and layout recognize the hierarchy of the zones, spanned from the less holy to the holiest realms. The Indic tradition of Hindu-Buddhist architecture recognize the concept of arranging elements in three parts or three elements. Subsequently, the design, plan and layout of the temple follows the rule of space allocation within three elements; commonly identified as foot (base), body (centre), and head (roof). They are Bhurloka represented by the outer courtyard and the foot (base) part of each temples, Bhuvarloka represented by the middle courtyard and the body of each temples, and Svarloka which symbolized by the roof of Hindu structure usually crowned with &quot;ratna&quot; (sanskrit: jewel) or vajra.

====Khmer architecture====

Before the 14th century, the Khmer Empire flourished in present-day Cambodia with its influence extended to most of mainland Southeast Asia. Its great capital, Angkor (, &quot;Capital City&quot;, derived from Sanskrit &quot;nagara&quot;), contains some of the most important and the most magnificent example of Khmer temple architecture. The classic style of Angkorian temple is demonstrated by the 12th century Angkor Wat. Angkorian builders mainly used sandstone and laterite as temple building materials.

The main superstructure of typical Khmer temple is a towering &quot;prasat&quot; called &quot;prang&quot; which houses the &quot;garbhagriha&quot; inner chamber, where the &quot;murti&quot; of Vishnu or Shiva, or a &quot;lingam&quot; resides. Khmer temples were typically enclosed by a concentric series of walls, with the central sanctuary in the middle; this arrangement represented the mountain ranges surrounding Mount Meru, the mythical home of the gods. Enclosures are the spaces between these walls, and between the innermost wall and the temple itself. The walls defining the enclosures of Khmer temples are frequently lined by galleries, while passage through the walls is by way of gopuras located at the cardinal points. The main entrance usually adorned with elevated causeway with cruciform terrace.

==Glossary==

<text>Bankwest is an Australian bank based in Perth, Western Australia. It was founded as the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia in 1895 by the Government of Western Australia being renamed the Rural and Industries Bank in 1944, and Bankwest in 1994 before being privatised. After a period of being a listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange, it was taken over by the Bank of Scotland, and since 2008 has been a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank.

Having expanded into the Eastern states in the 1980s, it closed the last of these branches in October 2022. The remaining 60 branches in Western Australia will be closed by the end of 2024 with 15 being converted to Commonwealth Bank branches. Bankwest will then become an online bank only.

== History ==


===Agricultural Bank era===
In 1895, the Government of Western Australia established the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia as a rural lender to support the state&#x27;s farming industries. Despite its name, it was not a bank, as it did not accept deposits from the public, its liabilities being government bonds. It was a government instrumentality that lent exclusively to farmers.

===Rural &amp; Industries Bank era===
On 1 October 1945 pursuant to the &quot;Rural and Industries Bank Act 1944&quot;, the Agricultural Bank changed its name to the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia becoming a full trading bank. This enabled it to expand its retail and commercial banking services throughout the state. Its headquarters were at the former Agricultural Bank headquarters at 555 Hay Street, Perth.

In 1956 it became a savings bank. In March 1961, its headquarters moved to a purpose building in Barrack Street. In 1973, a 45% shareholding in Perpetual Finance Corporation was purchased increasing to 100% in 1978. A major shareholding in the Town &amp; Country Permanent Building Society was also purchased in 1973.

In 1985, the first interstate branch was opened in Sydney. In June 1987, the Primary Industry Bank of Australia became a subsidiary. In August 1987, the Teachers&#x27; Credit Society was taken over in a bailout. In 1988, the headquarters moved to 108 St Georges Terrace, which was the tallest building in Perth at the time.

===Bankwest era===
The bank was incorporated in 1990, and in 1994 changed its name to the Bank of Western Australia with the trading name Bankwest, in preparation for privatisation. In December 1995, the Bank of Scotland acquired the bank, and as part of the sale agreement, offered 49 per cent of the shares in Bankwest to the public. Bankwest was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on 1 February 1996.

In May 2001, Bank of Scotland merged with Halifax to form HBOS. In August 2003, HBOS completed a successful takeover offer for the shares it did not own with Bankwest delisted from the ASX.

In 2003, Bankwest acquired API Finance from Australian Pharmaceutical Industries for $300 million in line with its industry specialisation growth strategy in the business banking segment.

In October 2006, Bankwest announced it would move its headquarters from 108 St Georges Terrace to 300 Murray Street. After lengthy delays, the move occurred in September 2012. Bankwest&#x27;s lease expires in 2031.

In September 2008, Bankwest was included in the sale of HBOS to Lloyds TSB. The following month, with significant problems of its own during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Lloyds TSB agreed terms to sell Bankwest to the Commonwealth Bank for $2.1 billion. The sale was completed in December 2008.

Bankwest&#x27;s business banking operation was closed and its customers moved to the Commonwealth Bank, sparking a senate inquiry.

In February 2022, Bankwest announced it would stop offering business products and services and eventually shift existing business customers to the Commonwealth Bank.

===Branch closures===

In July 2018, Bankwest announced plans to close 29 branches in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland citing that an overwhelming number of its customers were choosing to bank online. In October 2022, Bankwest closed all its east coast branches.

In March 2024, Bankwest announced that it will close all remaining 60 branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) by the end of 2024 and become a digital bank. Fifteen regional branches will be converted to Commonwealth Bank branches and 45 closed. Cash transactions will be available via other banks&#x27; ATMs and Australia Post.

==Sponsorships==
Bankwest was naming rights sponsor of the Fremantle Football Club in 2004 and 2005.

In 2018, Bankwest signed a seven-year contract to be the naming rights sponsor of Western Sydney Stadium. However, after only three years, the contract was taken over by the Commonwealth Bank and the stadium rebranded CommBank Stadium.

<doc id="702661" wikidata="Q550599" url="?curid=702661" title="Natya Shastra">
<text>The Nāṭya Shāstra (, &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot;) is a Sanskrit treatise on the performing arts. The text is attributed to sage Bharata, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.

The text consists of 36 chapters with a cumulative total of 6,000 poetic verses describing performance arts. The subjects covered by the treatise include dramatic composition, structure of a play and the construction of a stage to host it, genres of acting, body movements, make up and costumes, role and goals of an art director, the musical scales, musical instruments and the integration of music with art performance.
The &quot;Nāṭya Śāstra&quot; is notable as an ancient encyclopedic treatise on the arts, one which has influenced dance, music and literary traditions in India. It is also notable for its aesthetic &quot;Rasa&quot; theory, which asserts that entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and that the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder, where they experience the essence of their own consciousness, and reflect on spiritual and moral questions. The text further inspired secondary literature such as the 10th century commentary Abhinavabharati – an example of a classic Sanskrit bhasya (&quot;reviews and commentaries&quot;) – written by Abhinavagupta.

==Etymology==
The title of the text is composed of two words, &quot;Nāṭya&quot; and &quot;Shāstra&quot;. The root of the Sanskrit word &quot;Nāṭya&quot; is &quot;Nata&quot; (नट) which means &quot;act, represent&quot;. The word &quot;Shāstra&quot; (शास्त्र) means &quot;precept, rules, manual, compendium, book or treatise&quot;, and is generally used as a suffix in the Indian literature context, for knowledge in a defined area of practice.

==Date and author==

The composition date of &quot;Nāṭya Shāstra&quot; is unknown. Estimates vary between 500 BCE to 500 CE. The text may have started in the 1st millennium BCE, expanded over time, and most scholars suggest, based on mention of this text in other Indian literature, that the first complete version of the text was likely finished between 200 BCE to 200 CE. The &quot;Nāṭyaśāstra&quot; is traditionally alleged to be linked to a 36,000 verse Vedic composition called &quot;Adibharata&quot;, however there is no corroborating evidence that such a text ever existed.

The text has survived into the modern age in several manuscript versions, wherein the title of the chapters varies and in some cases the content of the few chapters differ. Some recensions show significant interpolations and corruption of the text, along with internal contradictions and sudden changes in style. Scholars such as PV Kane state that some text was likely changed as well as added to the original between the 3rd to 8th century CE, thus creating some variant editions, and the mixture of poetic verses and prose in a few extant manuscripts of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; may be because of this. According to Pramod Kale, who received a doctorate on the text from the University of Wisconsin, the surviving version of &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; likely existed by the 8th-century.

The author of the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; is unknown, and the Hindu tradition attributes it to the &quot;Rishi&quot; (sage) Bharata. It may be the work of several authors, but scholars disagree. Bharat Gupt states that the text stylistically shows characteristics of a single compiler in the existing version, a view shared by Kapila Vatsyayan. The &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, a generic encyclopedia, includes chapters on dramatic arts and poetry, which follow the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; format, but enumerates more styles and types of performance arts, which states Winternitz, may reflect an expansion in studies of the arts by the time &quot;Agni Purana&quot; was composed.

===Historical roots===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; is the oldest surviving ancient Indian work on performance arts. The roots of the text extend at least as far back as the &quot;Naṭasūtras&quot;, dated to around the mid 1st millennium BCE.

The &quot;Natasutras&quot; are mentioned in the text of Panini, the sage who wrote the classic on Sanskrit grammar, and who is dated to about 500 BCE. This performance arts related Sutra text is mentioned in other late Vedic texts, as are two scholars names Shilalin (IAST: Śilālin) and Krishashva (Kṛśaśva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing, dance and Sanskrit compositions for these arts. The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; refers to drama performers as Śhailālinas, likely because they were so known at the time the text was written, a name derived from the legacy of the vedic sage Śilālin credited with &quot;Natasutras&quot;. Richmond et al. estimate the &quot;Natasutras&quot; to have been composed around 600 BCE.

According to Lewis Rowell, a professor of Music specializing on classical Indian music, the earliest Indian artistic thought included three arts, syllabic recital (&quot;vadya&quot;), melos (&quot;gita&quot;) and dance (&quot;nrtta&quot;), as well as two musical genre, &quot;Gandharva&quot; (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and &quot;Gana&quot; (informal, improvised, entertainment music). The &quot;Gandharva&quot; subgenre also implied celestial, divine associations, while the &quot;Gana&quot; was free form art and included singing. The Sanskrit musical tradition spread widely in the Indian subcontinent during the late 1st millennium BCE, and the ancient Tamil classics make it &quot;abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries&quot;.

The art schools of Shilalin and Krishashva, mentioned in both the Brahmanas and the Kalpasutras and Srautasutras, may have been associated with the performance of vedic rituals, which involved storytelling with embedded ethical values. The Vedanga texts such as verse 1.4.29 of &quot;Panini Sutras&quot; mention these as well. The roots of the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; thus likely trace to the more ancient vedic traditions of integrating ritual recitation, dialogue and song in a dramatic representation of spiritual themes. The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of Shatapatha Brahmana (~800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.

==Structure==

The most studied version of the text, consisting of about 6000 poetic verses, is structured into 36 chapters. The tradition believes that the text originally had 12,000 verses. Somewhat different versions of the manuscripts exist, and these contain 37 or 38 chapters. Predominant number of its verses are in precise Anustubh meter (4x8, or exactly 32 syllables in every &quot;shloka&quot;), some verses are in Arya meter (a morae-based Sanskrit meter), and the text has some text that is in prose particularly in chapters 6, 7 and 28.

The structure of the text harmoniously compiles aspects of the theatrical arts into separate chapters. The text opens with the mythical genesis and history of drama, mentions the role of different Hindu deities in various aspects of the arts, and the recommended puja (consecration ceremony) of a stage for performance arts. The text, states Natalia Lidova, then describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures.

Chapters 6 and 7 present the &quot;Rasa&quot; theory on aesthetics in performance arts, while chapters 8 to 13 are dedicated to the art of acting. Stage instruments such as methods for holding accessories, weapons, relative movement of actors and actresses, scene formulation, stage zones, conventions and customs are included in chapters 10 to 13 of the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;.

The chapters 14 to 20 are dedicated to plot and structure of underlying text behind the performance art. These sections include the theory of Sanskrit prosody, musical meters and the language of expression. Chapter 17 presents the attributes of poetry and figures of speech, while chapter 18 presents the art of speech and delivery in the performance arts. The text lists ten kinds of play, presents its theory of plot, costumes, and make-up. The text dedicates several chapters exclusively to women in performance arts, with chapter 24 on female theater. The training of actors is presented in chapters 26 and 35 of the text.

The theory of music, techniques for singing, and music instruments are discussed over chapters 28 to 34. The text in its final chapters describes the various types of dramatic characters, their roles and need for team work, what constitutes an ideal troupe, closing out the text with its comments of the importance of performance arts on culture.

==Contents==
The contents of the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, states Susan Schwartz, are &quot;in part theatrical manual, part philosophy of aesthetics, part mythological history, part theology&quot;. It is the oldest surviving encyclopedic treatise on dramaturgy from India, with sections on the theory and practice of various performance arts. The text extends its reach into asking and understanding the goals of performance arts, the nature of the playwright, the artists and the spectators, their intimate relationship during the performance. &quot;Natya&quot; topics as envisioned in this text includes what in western performing arts would include drama, dance, theatre, poetry and music. The text integrates its aesthetics, axiology and description of arts with mythologies associated with Hindu Devas and Devis. Performance arts, states &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, are a form of Vedic ritual ceremony (yajna).

The general approach of the text is treated entertainment as an effect, but not the primary goal of arts. The primary goal is to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values. The text allows, states Schwartz, the artists &quot;enormous innovation&quot; as they connect the playwright and the spectators, through their performance, to &quot;Rasa&quot; (the essence, juice).

The &quot;rasa theory&quot; of &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, presumes that bliss is intrinsic and innate in man, it exists in oneself, that manifests non-materially through spiritual and personally subjective means. Performance arts aim to empower man to experience this &quot;rasa&quot;, or re-experience it. Actors aim to journey the spectator to this aesthetic experience within him. Rasa is prepared, states &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, through a creative synthesis and expression of &quot;vibhava&quot; (determinants), &quot;anubhava&quot; (consequents) and &quot;vyabhicharibhava&quot; (transitory states). In the process of emotionally engaging the individual in the audience, the text outlines the use of eight sentiments – erotic, comic, pathetic, terrible, furious, odious, heroic and marvellous.

=== Concept of &quot;Natya&quot; ===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor&#x27;s art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. The &quot;Natya&quot; connects through &quot;abhinaya&quot;, that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein asserts &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, the actors use two practices of &quot;dharmi&quot; (performance), in four styles and four regional variations, accompanied by song and music in a playhouse carefully designed to achieve &quot;siddhi&quot; (success in production).

The verse details the eleven essential components of drama and dramatic production:

# &quot;Rasa&quot;
# &quot;Bhāva&quot;
# &quot;Abhinaya&quot;
# &quot;Dharmī&quot; 
# &quot;Vṛtti&quot;
# &quot;Pravṛtti&quot;
# &quot;Svara-gāna-ātodya&quot; (accompanying vocal and instrumental music)
# &quot;Raṅga -&quot; (places of performance)
# &quot;Siddhi&quot; (success of the production)

=== Stage ===
The text discusses a variety of performance arts as well as the design of the stage. The text details three architectural styles for the playhouse:

# &quot;Vikrista&quot; (oblong)
# &quot;Caturasra&quot; (square)
# &quot;Tryasra&quot; (triangular)
Drama did not require painted scenery, instead utilizing costumes and makeup. Well aware of the limitations of realism, descriptions of the setting were interwoven in rhythmic verse and prose. Further, detailed zonal rules outlined how to portray settings inside and outside a house, as well as settings near or far. For example, change in acts would convey travel to distant lands. 

===Drama===

Drama, in this ancient Sanskrit text, is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.

The text discusses the universal and inner principles of drama, that it asserts successfully affects and journeys the audience to a supersensual state of discovery and understanding. The stories and plots were provided by the Itihasas (epics), the Puranas and the Kathas genre of Hindu literature. The text also states that the god Brahma combined the elements of acting from the four Vedas: &quot;recitation from the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, music from the &quot;Samaveda&quot;, mimetic art from the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, and sentiments from the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;.&quot;

The text states that the playwright should know the &quot;bhavas&quot; (inner state of being) of all characters in the story, and it is these bhavas that the audience of that drama connects with. The hero is shown to be similar to everyone in some ways, trying to achieve the four goals of human life in Hindu philosophy, then the &quot;vastu&quot; (plot) emerges through the &quot;representation of three worlds – the divine, the human, the demonic&quot;. Drama has dharma, it has artha, it has kama, it has humor, fighting and killing. The best drama shows the good and the bad, actions and feelings, of each character, whether God or man.

According to &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, state Sally Banes and Andre Lepeck, drama is that art which accepts human beings are in different inner states when they arrive as audience, then through the art performed, it provides enjoyment to those wanting pleasure, solace to those in grief, calmness to those who are worried, energy to those who are brave, courage to those who are cowards, eroticism to those who want company, enjoyment to those who are rich, knowledge to those who are uneducated, wisdom to those who are educated. Drama represents the truths about life and worlds, through emotions and circumstances, to deliver entertainment, but more importantly ethos, questions, peace and happiness.

The text goes into specifics to explain the means available within dramatic arts to achieve its goals. Just like the taste of food, states &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, is determined by combination of vegetables, spices and other articles such as sugar and salt, the audience tastes dominant states of a drama through expression of words, gestures and temperaments. These dominant states are love, mirth, sorrow, anger, energy, terror, disgust and astonishment. Further, states the text, there are 33 psychological states which are transitory such as discouragement, weakness, apprehension, intoxication, tiredness, anxiety, agitation, despair, impatience. There are eight temperamental states that a drama can deploy to carry its message. The text describes four means of communication between the actors and the audience – words, gestures, dresses, representation of temperament and &quot;aharya&quot; (make ups, cosmetics), all of which should be harmonious with the temperament envisioned in the drama. The text discusses the dominant, transitory and temperamental states, for dramatic arts, and the means that an artist can use to express these states, in chapters 6 through 7.

The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; describes the stage for performance arts as the sacred space for artists, and discusses the specifics of stage design, positioning the actors, the relative locations, movement on stage, entrance and exit, change in background, transition, objects displayed on the stage, and such architectural features of a theatre; the text asserts that these aspects help the audience get absorbed in the drama as well as understand the message and the meaning being communicated. After the 10th-century, Hindu temples were designed to include stages for performance arts (for example, &quot;kuttampalams&quot;), or prayer halls (for example, &quot;namghar&quot;) that seconded as dramatic arts stage, based on the square principle described in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, such as those in the peninsular and eastern states of India.

===Song and dance in arts===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; discusses Vedic songs, and also dedicates over 130 verses to non-Vedic songs. Chapter 17 of the text is entirely dedicated to poetry and the structure of a song, which it states is also the template for composing plays. Its chapter 31 asserts that there are seven types of songs, and these are &quot;Mandraka&quot;, &quot;Aparantaka&quot;, &quot;Rovindaka&quot;, &quot;Prakari&quot;, &quot;Ullopyaka&quot;, &quot;Ovedaka&quot; and &quot;Uttara&quot;. It also elaborates on 33 melodic alankaras in songs. These are melodic tools of art for any song, and they are essential. Without these melodic intonations, states the text, a song becomes like &quot;a night without the moon, a river without water, a creeper without a flower and a woman without an ornament&quot;. A song also has four basic architectural &quot;varna&quot; to empower its meaning, and these tone patterns are ascending line, steady line, descending line and the unsteady line.

The ideal poem produces bliss in the reader, or listener. It transports the audience into an imaginative world, transforms his inner state, and delivers him to a higher level of consciousness, suggests &quot;Natyashastra&quot;. Great songs do not instruct or lecture, they delight and liberate from within to a state of godlike ecstasy. According to Susan Schwartz, these sentiments and ideas of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; likely influenced the devotional songs and musical trends of the Bhakti movement that emerged in Hinduism during the second half of the 1st millennium CE.

Indian dance (&quot;nritta&quot;, नृत्त) traditions, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, have roots in the aesthetics of &quot;Natyashastra&quot;. The text defines the basic dance unit to be a &quot;karana&quot;, which is a specific combination of the hands and feet integrated with specific body posture and gait (&quot;sthana&quot; and &quot;chari&quot; respectively). Chapter 4 describes 108 &quot;karanas&quot; as the building blocks to the art of dance. The text states the various movements of major and minor limbs with facial states as means of articulating ideas and expressing emotions.

===Music and musical instruments===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; is, states Emmie te Nijenhuis, the oldest surviving text that systematically treats &quot;the theory and instruments of Indian music&quot;. Music has been an integral part of performance arts in the Hindu tradition since its Vedic times, and the theories of music found in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; are also found in many Puranas, such as the Markandeya Purana.

Prior to the &quot;Natyashastra,&quot; the ancient Indian tradition classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of). The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; accepts these four categories as given, and dedicates four separate chapters to them, one each on stringed instruments (&#x27;tat&#x27; or chordophones), hollow instruments (&#x27;sushir&#x27; or aerophones), solid instruments (&#x27;ghan&#x27; or idiophones), and covered instruments (&#x27;avanaddha&#x27; or membranophones).

Chapters 15 and 16 of the text discuss Sanskrit prosody in a manner similar to those found in more ancient Vedanga texts such as the &quot;Pingala Sutras&quot;. Chapters 28 through 34 are dedicated to music, both vocal and instrument based. Chapter 28, discusses the harmonic scale, calling the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as &quot;Shruti&quot;, with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,


The music theory in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, states Maurice Winternitz, centers around three themes – sound, rhythm and prosody applied to musical texts. The text asserts that the octave has 22 &quot;shrutis&quot; or microintervals of musical tones or 1200 cents. This is very close to the ancient Greek system, states Emmie Te Nijenhuis, with the difference that each &quot;shruti&quot; computes to 54.5 cents, while the Greek enharmonic quartertone system computes to 55 cents. The text discusses &quot;gramas&quot; (scales) and &quot;murchanas&quot; (modes), mentioning three scales of seven modes (21 total), some of which are the same as the Greek modes. However, the Gandhara-grama is just mentioned in &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, while its discussion largely focuses on two scales, fourteen modes and eight four &quot;tanas&quot; (notes). The text also discusses which scales are best for different forms of performance arts.

The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; describes from chapter 28 onwards, four types of regular musical instruments, grouping them as stringed giving the example of veena, covered giving the example of drums, solid giving the example of cymbals, and hollow stating flutes as example. Chapter 33 asserts team performance, calling it &quot;kutapa&quot; (orchestra) which it states to have one male and one female singer with nine to eleven musical instruments accompanied by players.

===Male and female actors===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; enshrines the male and female actors in any performance art to be the most important. The brightness of performance, or its lack, impacts everything; a great play that is poorly performed confuses and loses the audience, while a play that is inferior in significance or meaning becomes beautiful to the audience when brilliantly performed, states &quot;Natyashastra&quot;. A performance art of any form needs auditors and director, states the text, whose role is to work together with the actors from the perspective of the audience and the significance or meaning the playwright of the art work is attempting to convey.
The text dedicates significant number of verses on actor training, as did the Indian dramaturgy literature that arose in its wake. The ideal actor training, states &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, encourages self-development within the actor and raises the actor&#x27;s level of consciousness, which in turn empowers him or her to express ideas from that higher state of consciousness. Acting is more than physical techniques or rote recitation, it is communication through emotions and expression of embedded meaning and levels of consciousness in the underlying text.

The actor, states the text, should understand the three Guṇas, that is &quot;Sattva&quot;, &quot;Rajas&quot; and &quot;Tamas&quot; qualities, because human lives are an interplay of these. The actor must feel a specific state within, to express it without. Thus, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, the guidelines in &quot;Natyashastra&quot; employ the ideas in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, with concepts mirroring &quot;asanas&quot;, &quot;pranayama&quot; and &quot;dhyana&quot;, both for actor training and the expression of higher levels of consciousness.

Specific training on gestures and movements for actors, their performance and significance, are discussed in chapters 8 through 12 of the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;. Chapter 24 is dedicated to females in performance arts, however other chapters on actor training include numerous verses that mention women along with men.

===The goals of art: spiritual values===
The &quot;Natyashastra&quot; and other ancient Hindu texts such as the Yajnavalkya Smriti assert that arts and music are spiritual, with the power to guide one to moksha, through empowering the concentration of mind for the liberation of the Self (soul, Atman). These arts are offered as alternate paths (Marga Natya or yoga), in strength similar to the knowledge of the Shrutis (Vedas and Upanishads). Various medieval scholars, such as the 12th-century Mitaksara and Apararka, cite &quot;Natyashastra&quot; and Bharata in linking arts to spirituality, while the text itself asserts that beautiful songs are sacred and performance arts are holy.

The goal of performance arts, states &quot;Natyashastra&quot; is ultimately to let the spectator experience his own consciousness, then evaluate and feel the spiritual values innate in him, and rise to a higher level of consciousness. The playwright, the actors and the director (conductor) all aim to transport the spectator to an aesthetic experience within him to eternal universals, to emancipate him from the mundane to creative freedom within.

The function of drama and the art of theatre, as envisioned in &quot;Natyashastra&quot; states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, is to restore the human potential, man&#x27;s journey of &quot;delight at a higher level of consciousness&quot;, and a life that is enlightened.

==Ancient and medieval secondary literature: bhasya==

&quot;Abhinavabhāratī&quot; is the most studied commentary on &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, written by Abhinavagupta (950–1020 CE), who referred to &quot;Natyashastra&quot; also as the &quot;Natyaveda&quot;. Abhinavagupta&#x27;s analysis of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions, such as &quot;whether human beings comprehend performance arts as &quot;tattva&quot; (reality and truth in another plane), or is it an error, or is it a form of superimposed reality (&quot;aropa&quot;)?

Abhinavagupta asserts that &quot;Natyashastra&quot; and performance arts appeal to man because of &quot;the experience of wonder&quot;, wherein the observer is pulled in, immersed, engaged, absorbed, and satisfied. The performance arts in &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, states Abhinavagupta, temporarily suspends man from his ordinary world, transfers him into another parallel reality full of wonder, where he experiences and reflects on spiritual and moral concepts, and in there is the power of arts to transform the inner state of man, where the beauty of the art lifts him into the goals of Dharma (correct living, virtues, duties, right versus wrong, responsibilities, righteous). Abhinavagupta is also known for his Advaita Vedanta treatises and a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, where he touches upon the aesthetics in &quot;Natyashastra&quot;.

The detailed &quot;Natyashastra&quot; review and commentary of Abhinavagupta mentions older Sanskrit commentaries on the text, suggesting the text was widely studied and had been influential. His discussion of pre-10th century scholarly views and list of references suggest that there once existed secondary literature on the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; by at least Kirtidhara, Bhaskara, Lollata, Sankuka, Nayaka, Harsa and Tauta. However, all text manuscripts of these scholars have been lost to history or are yet to be discovered.

==Influence==

The first chapter of the text declares that the text&#x27;s origins came after the four Vedas had been established, and yet there was lust, covetousness, wrath and jealously among human beings. The text was written as a fifth Veda, so that the essence of the Vedas can be heard and viewed, in &quot;Natya&quot; form to encourage every member of the society to dharma, artha and kama. The text originated to enable arts that influence the society and encourage each individual to consider good counsel, to explain sciences and demonstrate arts and crafts widely. The text is a guide and progeny of what is in the Vedas, asserts the &quot;Natysashastra&quot;. The text re-asserts a similar message in the closing chapter, stating for example, in verses 36.20–21 that performance arts such as drama, songs, music, and dance with music are equal in importance as the exposition of the Vedic hymns, and that participating in vocal or instrumental music once is superior to bathing in river Ganges for a thousand days.

Nāṭyaśāstra, states Natalia Lidova, has been far more than &quot;a mere compendium on drama&quot;. It provided the foundation of theatrical and literary works that followed, which shaped the post-Vedic culture. It has been an important source book of Hindu performance arts and its cultural beliefs regarding the role of arts in the social (dharmic) as well as the personal inner life of man in Hinduism.

The &quot;Natysashastra&quot; text has been influential in other arts. The 108 dance forms described in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot;, for example, have inspired Shiva sculptures of the 1st-millennium BCE, particularly the Tandava style which fuses many of these into a composite image found at the Nataraja temple of Chidambaram. The movements of dance and expression in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; are found carved on the pillars, walls and gateways of 1st-millennium Hindu temples.

The specifications provided in the &quot;Natyashastra&quot; can be found in the depiction of arts in sculpture, in icons and friezes across India.

The &quot;Rasa&quot; theory of &quot;Natyashastra&quot; has attracted scholarly interest in communication studies for its insights into developing texts and performances outside the Indian culture.

<text>Thomas Haden Church (born Thomas Richard McMillen; June 17, 1960) is an American actor. After starring in the 1990s sitcom &quot;Wings&quot; and playing the lead for two seasons in &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot; (1995–1997)&quot;,&quot; Church became known for his film work, including his role of Lyle van de Groot in &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; (1997), his Academy Award–nominated performance in &quot;Sideways&quot; (2004), his role as the Marvel Comics villain Sandman in the superhero films &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), as well as his starring roles in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; (2006), &quot;Smart People&quot; (2008), &quot;Easy A&quot; (2010), &quot;We Bought a Zoo&quot; (2011), &quot;Max&quot; (2015), and &quot;Hellboy&quot; (2019). He also made his directorial debut with &quot;Rolling Kansas&quot; (2003). In 2023, he starred as antagonist Agent Stone in the post-apocalyptic action comedy series &quot;Twisted Metal&quot;.

==Early life==
Church was born Thomas Richard McMillen on June 17, 1960, in Woodland, Yolo County, California, to Maxine (née Sanders; 1936–2021) and Carlos &quot;Carl&quot; Richard McMillen (1936–2008), who served for eight years in the Marines and who was on active duty at the end of the Korean War; after 1962, Carl worked as a surveyor. Church&#x27;s parents divorced, and he and his mother moved to Laredo, Texas. She remarried in 1969, to widower George A. Quesada, a veteran of an Army Air Forces reconnaissance unit which served in Guam in World War II. Church took his stepfather&#x27;s surname for a time but changed it to &#x27;Haden Church&#x27;, extracted from the names of other relatives, when people found &#x27;Quesada&#x27; difficult to pronounce. Church would often hunt with his stepfather and his stepfathers’ friends along the Rio Grande Valley and started working on a ranch in Webb County, Texas when he was 13. He left high school in 1977 to work in the oil fields of Louisiana, but he returned to graduate from Harlingen High School in 1979. He attended the University of North Texas while living in Dallas.

==Career==
Church started in the entertainment business as a radio personality and doing voice-over work. After appearing in an independent film, he moved to California to pursue an acting career. His character delivers a love letter to Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) from her deceased former lover, Eddie LaBec, in the &quot;Cheers&quot; episode, &quot;Death Takes a Vacation on Ice&quot;. He played the part of slow-witted aircraft mechanic Lowell Mather for six seasons (1990–95) on the NBC sitcom &quot;Wings&quot;.

He worked in television for two more seasons, with a lead role in &quot;Ned &amp; Stacey&quot; opposite Debra Messing. He has had supporting roles in films such as &quot;Tombstone&quot;, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Specials&quot;, and &quot;Demon Knight&quot;.

Church bought a ranch in Texas in 1998. In late 2000, he took a break from films. After having small roles in films such as &quot;Monkeybone&quot; and &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot;, he made his directorial debut with &quot;Rolling Kansas&quot; in 2003. He has voiceover work in commercials, such as for Merrill Lynch and Icehouse beer. 

In 2003, director Alexander Payne called him regarding the role of Jack, the selfish best friend of Paul Giamatti&#x27;s character, in &quot;Sideways&quot;. During the audition, Church stripped naked to read the audition scene, later saying &quot;To me, it was painfully obvious... I was reading the scene where Jack comes in naked and there has to be in-born vulnerability in the scene.&quot; (He later found that he was the only actor to strip down for the audition). &quot;Sideways&quot; earned acclaim for Church; he won an IFP Independent Spirit Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He has since appeared in films such as &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, done voice-over work on films such as &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; and starred in one of AMC&#x27;s highest rated television productions, &quot;Broken Trail&quot;, with Robert Duvall, in 2006, for which he won an Emmy. In 2007, he appeared as the villain Sandman in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; starring Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. He received praise for his portrayal of the character. Although he was not present on set he lent his voice to Sandman (digitally created) for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, which was released in 2021 and linked both the Raimi and Marc Webb franchises to the MCU. Archival footage from &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was used to show his human form at the end of the film where Jon Watts provided the motion-capture for Sandman.

In 2005, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In October 2008, Church appeared as &quot;Joe Six-Pack&quot; in a video on funnyordie.com, challenging Joe the Plumber to a beer-drinking contest. Church starred in the FEARnet webseries, &quot;Zombie Roadkill&quot;, alongside David Dorfman. He also appeared in the HBO original series &quot;Divorce&quot;.

In December 2021, it was announced that Church will star alongside Toni Collette and Anna Faris in the comedy film &quot;The Estate&quot;, directed by Dean Craig.

In March 2023, he played Lloyd in &quot;Acidman&quot;.

<doc id="702678" wikidata="Q880826" url="?curid=702678" title="George L. Shoup">
<text>George Laird Shoup (June 15, 1836December 21, 1904) was an American politician who served as the first governor of Idaho, in addition to its last territorial governor. He served several months after statehood in 1890 and then became one of the state&#x27;s first United States Senators.

==Early life==
Born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, northeast of Pittsburgh, Shoup was educated in the public school system. He moved to Galesburg, Illinois, in 1852 and farmed. He married Magdelena &quot;Lena&quot; Darnutzer of Iowa on June 15, 1868, and they had three sons and three daughters, Lena, Laura and Margaret.

==Career==
After being devastated financially in the Panic of 1857, Shoup moved to Colorado Territory in 1859 to engage in mining and merchandising near Pikes Peak and later in Denver.

During the Civil War, he enlisted with the independent scouts working in New Mexico Territory, Colorado Territory, and Texas. Shoup was commissioned as a second lieutenant when the 3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment was formed in 1861 and was mustered out as a colonel in December 1864. He took part in the Battle of Apache Canyon in New Mexico Territory during the Civil War and the Sand Creek massacre during the Colorado War.

After the war, Shoup moved to Virginia City, Montana Territory, and then settled across the continental divide in Salmon, a city in Idaho Territory that he helped found. He owned general merchandise stores in both locations. Shoup was appointed commissioner to organize Lemhi County, and in 1874 he was elected to the territorial legislature. With few interruptions, he served on the Republican National Committee for Idaho from 1880 to 1904.

In April 1889, President Benjamin Harrison appointed Shoup governor of Idaho Territory, a position he held until July 1890, when Idaho became a state and Idaho Territory ceased to exist. Shoup was elected the state&#x27;s first governor in October. He served as governor of the new state for only a few weeks. In November 1890 the Idaho Legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate. Shoup resigned as governor in December to take his Senate seat and was succeeded by lieutenant governor N. B. Willey.

In the U.S. Senate for over a decade, from 1890 to 1901, Shoup had many interests, including pensions, education, and military affairs. He was chairman of the Committee on Territories. In that position he advocated liberal and just treatment of the Native Americans. Shoup was reelected to a full six-year term in the Senate by the state legislature in January 1895, but was defeated in January 1901 by Democrat Fred Dubois, and retired from public life and resided in Boise.

Two years later at age 66, Shoup made a final attempt to return to the U.S. Senate, but bowed out of the four-man race for the Republican nomination in the legislature in January 1903. He gave his support to fellow Pennsylvania native Weldon Heyburn of the Silver Valley, who defeated Boise attorney William Borah for the nomination and Democrat James Hawley of Boise for the seat. Four years later, Borah easily won the other U.S. Senate seat, and served for nearly 33 years.

==Death==
Shoup died in Boise, Idaho at the age 68 on December 21, 1904, and was given a state funeral in Idaho. He is interred in the Boise Pioneer Cemetery, alongside his wife Lena, who died in Salmon, Idaho in 1927.

==Legacy==
In 1910, the state of Idaho donated a marble statue of Shoup to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol. It was joined by a statue of Senator Borah (1865–1940) in 1947.

The unincorporated community of Shoup, Idaho on the Salmon River, northwest and downstream of Salmon, was named for him in 1882. During World War II, a Liberty ship named &quot;S.S. George L. Shoup&quot; (hull #2004) was launched at the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation in Portland in May 1943. A new men&#x27;s dormitory at the University of Idaho in Moscow was named for him in 1958.

Shoup&#x27;s papers were donated to the University of Idaho, having been gathered by his son William and presented by his grandson, G. Elmo Shoup.

<text>In chess, en passant (, &quot;in passing&quot;) describes the capture by a pawn of an enemy pawn on the same and an adjacent that has just made an initial two-square advance. This is a special case in the rules of chess. The capturing pawn moves to the square that the enemy pawn passed over, as if the enemy pawn had advanced only one square. The rule ensures that a pawn cannot use its two-square move to safely skip past an enemy pawn.

Capturing &quot;en passant&quot; is permitted only on the turn immediately after the two-square advance; it cannot be done on a later turn. The capturing move is sometimes notated by appending the abbreviation e.p.
==Rules==

The conditions for a pawn to capture an enemy pawn &quot;en passant&quot; are as follows:

* the enemy pawn advanced two squares on the previous turn;
* the capturing pawn attacks the square that the enemy pawn passed over. 
If these conditions are met, the capturing pawn can move diagonally forward to the square that the enemy pawn passed, capturing the enemy pawn as if it had moved only one square. If the right to capture &quot;en passant&quot; is not exercised immediately, it is lost. Making the capture is optional, unless there is no other legal move. 
Only pawns may capture or be captured &quot;en passant&quot;. The &quot;en passant&quot; capture is the only capturing move in chess where the capturing piece moves to a square not occupied by the captured piece.

Because many casual players are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the &quot;en passant&quot; rule, administrators on internet chess sites frequently receive erroneous complaints of bugs, cheating or hacking.

==Notation==
In algebraic notation, an &quot;en passant&quot; capture is notated using the capturing pawn&#x27;s destination square. In both algebraic and descriptive notation, the move may optionally be denoted by appending &quot;e.p.&quot; or similar. For example, in algebraic notation, bxa3 or bxa3 e.p. may be used to represent a black pawn on b4 capturing a white pawn on a4 &quot;en passant&quot;.

==Examples==

Some chess openings feature the &quot;en passant&quot; capture. In the following line from Petrov&#x27;s Defence, White captures the pawn on d5 &quot;en passant&quot; on move 6:

:1. e4 e5
:2. Nf3 Nf6
:3. d4 exd4
:4. e5 Ne4
:5. Qxd4 d5 (see diagram)
:6. exd6 e.p.

An &quot;en passant&quot; capture can occur as early as move 3. For example, in the French Defence after 1.e4 e6 2.e5 d5, White can play 3.exd6 e.p. (). This has occurred in play, for example in the game Steinitz–Fleissig, Vienna 1882.


In the diagram, the move 1...g5+ may seem to checkmate White, but it is in fact a blunder: White can counter this check with the &quot;en passant&quot; capture 2.fxg6 e.p., which cross-checks and checkmates Black. (Black can draw in the diagrammed position by playing 1...Qxf2+.)

In a game between Gunnar Gundersen and Albert H. Faul, Black played 12...f7-f5. White could have captured the black f-pawn &quot;en passant&quot; with his e-pawn, but he instead played:
:13. h5+ Kh6 14. Nxe6+ 
The bishop on c1 effects a discovered check. 14...Kh7 results in 15.Qxg7#.
:14... g5 15. hxg6 e.p.#
The &quot;en passant&quot; capture places Black in double check and checkmate (in fact, White&#x27;s bishop is not necessary for the mate). An &quot;en passant&quot; capture is the only way a double check can be delivered without one of the checking pieces moving, as in this case.

The largest known number of &quot;en passant&quot; captures in one game is three. This record is shared by three games; in none of them were all three captures by the same player. The earliest known example is a 1980 game between Alexandru Segal and Karl-Heinz Podzielny.
==History==
In early versions of chess, the pawn could not advance two squares on its first move. The two-square advance was introduced later, between the 13th and 16th centuries, to speed up games. The &quot;en passant&quot; capture may have been introduced at that time, or it may have come later; references to &quot;en passant&quot; captures appear in the books by the 16th-century Spanish chess master Ruy López de Segura.

The &quot;en passant&quot; capture was one of the last major additions to European chess. In some parts of Europe, particularly in Italy, there was no such rule; this was known as &quot;passar battaglia&quot;. In 1880, Italy adopted the rules used by the rest of the world, including the &quot;en passant&quot; capture, in preparation for the 1881 Milan tournament.

==Draw by repetition and stalemate==
In the context of threefold and fivefold repetition, two positions are considered different if the opportunity to perform a given &quot;en passant&quot; capture exists in one position but not the other.

When a player is not in check, and capturing &quot;en passant&quot; is their only legal move, they are forbidden to &quot;claim&quot; a draw by stalemate; they must either perform the move or end the game on their turn via normal means. In his book on chess organization and rules, International Arbiter Kenneth Harkness wrote that people frequently asked if this is the case. Chess players debated this point in the 19th century, with some arguing that the right to capture &quot;en passant&quot; is a &quot;privilege&quot; that one cannot be compelled to exercise. In his 1860 book &quot;Chess Praxis&quot;, Howard Staunton wrote that the &quot;en passant&quot; capture is mandatory in such a position; the rules of chess were amended to make this clear.

==Chess problems==
The &quot;en passant&quot; capture is often used as a theme in chess problems. According to Kenneth S. Howard, &quot;En passant pawn captures frequently produce striking effects in the opening and closing of lines, both for white and black.&quot; By retrograde analysis convention, a pawn may be captured &quot;en passant&quot; only if it can be proven to have advanced two squares on the previous move.
In the diagrammed 1938 composition by Howard, the 
:1. d4 
introduces the threat 2.d5+ cxd5 3.Bxd5#. Black can capture the d4-pawn &quot;en passant&quot; in either of two ways:
:1... exd3 e.p. 
shifting the e4-pawn from the e- to the d-file, preventing an &quot;en passant&quot; capture after White plays 2.f4. To stop the threat of 3.f5#, Black can advance 2...f5, but this allows White to play 3.exf6 e.p.# due to the decisive opening of the .

Or Black can play
:1... cxd3 e.p.
and now White exploits the newly opened a2–g8 diagonal with 2.Qa2+ d5 3.cxd6 e.p.#.


The diagrammed composition by Sommerfeldt shows the effect of pins on &quot;en passant&quot; captures.

The key 
:1. d4! 
threatens 2.Qf2#. The moves of the black e-pawn are restricted in an unusual manner. The &quot;en passant&quot; capture 1...exd3 e.p.+ is illegal (it exposes Black’s king to check), but 
:1... e3+ 
is legal. This, however, removes the black king&#x27;s access to e3, allowing 
:2. d5#

<text>Heather Matarazzo (born November 10, 1982) is an American actress. She is known for playing Lilly Moscovitz in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001) and its 2004 sequel, and Martha Meeks in &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000) and &quot;Scream&quot; (2022). Matarazzo made her film debut at age 12 in &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot; (1995), earning an Independent Spirit Award for her portrayal of Dawn Wiener. Her other credits include &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997), &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; (1998), &quot;54&quot; (1998), &quot;Sorority Boys&quot; (2002), &quot;Saved!&quot; (2004), and &quot;Sisters&quot; (2015).

Outside film, Matarazzo portrayed Heather Wiseman on the CBS series &quot;Now and Again&quot; (1999–2000), and had recurring roles on &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1997), &quot;Exes &amp; Ohs&quot; (2006–2009), and &quot;The L Word&quot; (2007). On stage, she appeared in the 2001–2002 Broadway revival of &quot;The Women&quot;.

== Early life ==
Matarazzo&#x27;s biological mother was Irish-American, while her biological father was from Ireland, from the town of Knock (Irish: &quot;An Cnoc&quot;), County Mayo. She was adopted and raised by the Matarazzos, an Italian-American family. She was raised in Oyster Bay, New York.

== Career ==
Matarazzo began acting at the age of six; after commandeering the microphone at an AIDS benefit for children, she was given the card of a talent manager, with whom she remained for ten years.

In 1997, she won an Independent Spirit Award for her performance as adolescent social outcast Dawn Wiener in &quot;Welcome to the Dollhouse&quot;. Matarazzo has expressed pleasure in being allowed to play interesting characters, some of whom &quot;are ostracized for various reasons.&quot; She has commented that she is most proud of her performance in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Our Guys: Outrage in Glen Ridge&quot;, based on a true story, in which she played a mentally challenged girl who is raped by football players. In 1999 to 2000, she portrayed Heather Wiseman in the short-lived TV series, &quot;Now and Again&quot;. In 2001, she appeared in the teen romantic comedy film &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; as Lilly Moscovitz and reprised her role in the 2004 sequel &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;.

Matarazzo has made appearances on several hit TV shows including &quot;Roseanne,&quot; &quot;Law &amp; Order,&quot; &quot;The L Word,&quot; &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Strangers With Candy.&quot; Matarazzo starred opposite Thaao Penghlis in the world premiere of Charles Evered&#x27;s play &quot;Class&quot; at Cape May Stage in Cape May, New Jersey in May and June 2010.

In 2011, Matarazzo announced that she would begin working on her directorial debut, a television series to be based on a memoir by author Diane Hanks, titled &quot;Summer Camp: A Memoir.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 2004, at the age of 21, Matarazzo came out as a lesbian in an article in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and was subsequently profiled in an article in the October 2004 edition of &quot;The Advocate&quot;. On July 31, 2008, Matarazzo&#x27;s publicist announced that Matarazzo was engaged to musician Caroline Murphy. In 2012, popular media news outlets announced that Matarazzo and Murphy had split amicably. Matarazzo married comedian Heather Turman in 2018.

Matarazzo was scheduled to attend a meeting on the 15th floor of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 but overslept.

Matarazzo endorsed and actively campaigned for Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

<doc id="702705" wikidata="Q1416058" url="?curid=702705" title="Sonification">
<text>Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Auditory perception has advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that open possibilities as an alternative or complement to visualization techniques.

For example, the rate of clicking of a Geiger counter conveys the level of radiation in the immediate vicinity of the device.

Though many experiments with data sonification have been explored in forums such as the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD), sonification faces many challenges to widespread use for presenting and analyzing data. For example, studies show it is difficult, but essential, to provide adequate context for interpreting sonifications of data. Many sonification attempts are coded from scratch due to the lack of flexible tooling for sonification research and data exploration.

==History==
The Geiger counter, invented in 1908, is one of the earliest and most successful applications of sonification. A Geiger counter has a tube of low-pressure gas; each particle detected produces a pulse of current when it ionizes the gas, producing an audio click. The original version was only capable of detecting alpha particles. In 1928, Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) improved the counter so that it could detect more types of ionizing radiation.

In 1913, Dr. Edmund Fournier d&#x27;Albe of University of Birmingham invented the optophone, which used selenium photosensors to detect black print and convert it into an audible output. A blind reader could hold a book up to the device and hold an apparatus to the area she wanted to read. The optophone played a set group of notes: . Each note corresponded with a position on the optophone&#x27;s reading area, and that note was silenced if black ink was sensed. Thus, the missing notes indicated the positions where black ink was on the page and could be used to read.

Pollack and Ficks published the first perceptual experiments on the transmission of information via auditory display in 1954. They experimented with combining sound dimensions such as timing, frequency, loudness, duration, and spatialization and found that they could get subjects to register changes in multiple dimensions at once. These experiments did not get into much more detail than that, since each dimension had only two possible values.

In 1970, Nonesuch Records released a new electronic music composition by the American composer Charles Dodge, &quot;The Earth&#x27;s Magnetic Field.&quot; It was produced at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. As the title suggests, the composition&#x27;s electronic sounds were synthesized from data from the earth&#x27;s magnetic field. As such, it may well be the first sonification of scientific data for artistic, rather than scientific, purposes.

John M. Chambers, Max Mathews, and F.R. Moore at Bell Laboratories did the earliest work on auditory graphing in their &quot;Auditory Data Inspection&quot; technical memorandum in 1974. 
They augmented a scatterplot using sounds that varied along frequency, spectral content, and amplitude modulation dimensions to use in classification. They did not do any formal assessment of the effectiveness of these experiments.

In 1976, philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, wrote, &quot;Just as science seems to produce an infinite set of visual images for virtually all of its phenomena--atoms to galaxies are familiar to us from coffee table books to science magazines; so &#x27;musics,&#x27; too, could be produced from the same data that produces visualizations.&quot; This appears to be one of the earliest references to sonification as a creative practice.

In early 1982 Sara Bly of the University of California, Davis, released two publications - with examples - of her work on the use of computer-generated sound to present data. At the time, the field of scientific visualization was gaining momentum. Among other things, her studies and the accompanying examples compared the properties between visual and aural presentation, demonstrating that &quot;Sound offers and enhancement and an alternative to graphic tools.&quot; Her work provides early experiment-based data to help inform matching appropriate data representation to type and purpose.

Also in the 1980s, pulse oximeters came into widespread use. Pulse oximeters can sonify oxygen concentration of blood by emitting higher pitches for higher concentrations. However, in practice this particular feature of pulse oximeters may not be widely utilized by medical professionals because of the risk of too many audio stimuli in medical environments.

In 1990, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications began generating scientific data sonifications and visualizations from the same source data and a paper describing this work was presented at the June 1991 SPIE Conference on Extracting Meaning from Complex Data. Included in the supporting information for the paper was a video, winner of the 1991 Nicograph Multimedia Grand Prize, comprising several data visualizations paired with their corresponding data sonifications.

In 1992, the International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD) was founded by Gregory Kramer as a forum for research on auditory display which includes data sonification. ICAD has since become a home for researchers from many different disciplines interested in the use of sound to convey information through its conference and peer-reviewed proceedings.

In May 2022, NASA reported the sonification (converting astronomical data associated with pressure waves into sound) of the black hole at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster.

In 2024, Adhyâropa Records released &quot;The Volcano Listening Project&quot; by Leif Karlstrom, which merges geophysics research and computer music synthesis with acoustic instrumental and vocal performances by Billy Contreras, Todd Sickafoose, and other acoustic musicians.

== Sonification techniques ==

Many different components can be altered to change the user&#x27;s perception of the sound, and in turn, their perception of the underlying information being portrayed. Often, an increase or decrease in some level in this information is indicated by an increase or decrease in pitch, amplitude or tempo, but could also be indicated by varying other less commonly used components. For example, a stock market price could be portrayed by rising pitch as the stock price rose, and lowering pitch as it fell. To allow the user to determine that more than one stock was being portrayed, different timbres or brightnesses might be used for the different stocks, or they may be played to the user from different points in space, for example, through different sides of their headphones.

Many studies have been undertaken to try to find the best techniques for various types of information to be presented, and as yet, no conclusive set of techniques to be used has been formulated. As the area of sonification is still considered to be in its infancy, current studies are working towards determining the best set of sound components to vary in different situations.

Several different techniques for auditory rendering of data can be categorized:
* Acoustic sonification
* Audification
* Model-based sonification
* Parameter mapping
* Stream-based sonification

An alternative approach to traditional sonification is &quot;sonification by replacement&quot;, for example Pulsed Melodic Affective Processing (PMAP). In PMAP rather than sonifying a data stream, the computational protocol is musical data itself, for example MIDI. The data stream represents a non-musical state: in PMAP an affective state. Calculations can then be done directly on the musical data, and the results can be listened to with the minimum of translation.
