<text>The history of aerial warfare began in ancient times, with the use of kites in China. In the third century, it progressed to balloon warfare. Airplanes were put to use for war starting in 1911, initially for reconnaissance, and then for aerial combat to shoot down the recon planes. The use of planes for strategic bombing emerged during World War II. Also during World War II, Nazi Germany developed many missile and precision-guided munition systems, including the first cruise missile, the first short-range ballistic missile, the first guided surface-to-air missiles, and the first anti-ship missiles. Ballistic missiles became of key importance during the Cold War, were armed with nuclear warheads, and were stockpiled by the superpowers – the United States and the Soviet Union – to deter each other from using them.

==Fictional predictions==

Since early history, various cultures developed myths of flying gods and deities, some of whom such as Zeus could throw thunderbolts from on high at earthbound humans. There were also fictions of humans finding ways to fly, such as the Greek Daedalus and Icarus. A logical combination was to imagine mundane humans flying – and making military use of their ability to fly. Imagination long preceded the technology needed for such warfare to be actually carried out.

In the third book of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), the King of the flying island of Laputa resorts to bombarding enemies and rebellious subjects with heavy rocks thrown from the air.

What might be the first detailed fictional depiction of what is now called an Air Force can be found in &quot;The Wicked Prince&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen (1840). The story&#x27;s world-conquering Prince, of boundless ambition and cruelty, orders &quot;a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the center of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again&quot;. Later, the Prince develops an improved model, able to also fire &quot;Steel Thunderbolts&quot;, and orders many thousands of them built to make up a massive air flotilla manned by his troops.

H. G. Wells in &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (1907) grasped the full implications of aerial warfare and air power and how it would revolutionize warfare. Many of the book&#x27;s predictions – such as the devastating strategic bombing of cities or how bombing from the air would make surface dreadnoughts obsolete in naval warfare – only came about in World War II rather than the first which broke out a few years after the book&#x27;s publication.

== Kite warfare ==
The earliest documented aerial warfare took place in ancient China, when a manned kite was set off to spy for military intelligence and communication.

== Balloon warfare ==
=== Ancient China ===
In or around the second or third century, a prototype hot air balloon, the Kongming lantern, was invented in China, serving as a military communication station.

=== Europe ===
Some minor warfare use was made of balloons in the infancy of aeronautics. The first instance was by the French Aerostatic Corps at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, who used a tethered balloon, &quot;L&#x27;entreprenant&quot;, to gain a vantage point.

Balloons had disadvantages. They could not fly in bad weather, fog, or high winds. They were at the mercy of the winds and were also very large targets.

=== Austrian use at Venice in 1849 ===
The first aggressive use of balloons in warfare took place in 1849. Austrian imperial forces besieging Venice attempted to float some 200 paper hot air balloons each carrying a 24–30-pound (11–14 kg) bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from the side-wheel steamer SMS Vulcano that acted as a balloon carrier. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship Vulcano.

===American Civil War===
==== Union Army Balloon Corps ====

The American Civil War was the first war to witness significant use of aeronautics in support of battle. Thaddeus Lowe made noteworthy contributions to the Union war effort using a fleet of balloons he created In June 1861 professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe left his work in the private sector and offered his services as an Aeronaut to President Lincoln, who took some interest in the idea of an air war. Lowe&#x27;s demonstration of flying a balloon over Washington, DC, and transmitting a telegraph message to the ground was enough to have him introduced to the commanders of the topographical engineers; initially it was thought balloons could be used for preparing better maps.

Lowe&#x27;s first action was a free flight observation of the Confederate positions at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861.

Lowe was called to Fort Corcoran and ascended in order to spot rebel encampments. With flag signals he directed artillery fire on the rebels.

Lowe and other balloonists formed the Union Army Balloon Corps. Lowe insisted on the strict use of tethered (as opposed to free) flight because of concern about being shot down over enemy lines and punished as spies. By attaining altitudes from to as much as 3½ miles, an expansive view of the battle field and beyond could be had.

As the Confederates retreated, the war turned into the Peninsular Campaign. Due to the heavy forests on the peninsula, the balloons were unable to follow on land so a coal barge was converted to operate the balloons. The balloons and their gas generators were loaded aboard and taken down the Potomac, where reconnaissance of the peninsula could continue.

At the Battle of Fair Oaks, Lowe was able to view the enemy army advancing and sent a dispatch to have reserves sent.

The balloon corps was later assigned to the engineers corps. By August 1863, the Union Army Balloon Corps was disbanded.

====Confederate Army====

The Confederate Army also made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by lack of supplies due to embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in Richmond, Virginia. By the summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the American Civil War had ceased.

==Before World War I==
The Declaration Prohibiting the Discharge of Projectiles and Explosives from Balloons , part of the 1907 Hague Convention ratified by the United States, Great Britain and China, outlawed aircraft ordnance and aerial bombing.

The United States Navy showed interest in naval aviation from the turn of the 20th century. In August 1910 Jacob Earl Fickel conducted his first experiments with Glenn Curtiss – shooting a gun from an airplane. In 1910–1911 the Navy conducted experiments which proved the practicality of carrier-based aviation. On November 14, 1910, near Hampton Roads, Virginia, civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from a wooden platform installed on the scout cruiser &quot;USS Birmingham&quot; (CL-2). He landed safely on shore a few minutes later. Ely proved several months later that it was also possible to land on a ship. On January 18, 1911, he landed on a platform attached to the American cruiser &quot;USS Pennsylvania&quot; (ACR-4) in San Francisco harbor.

The first use of airplanes in an actual war occurred in the 1911 Italo-Turkish War with Italian Army Air Corps Blériot XI and Nieuport IV monoplanes bombing a Turkish camp at Ain Zara in Libya. In the First Balkan War (1912) the Bulgarian Air Force bombed Turkish positions at Adrianople, while the Greek Aviation performed, over the Dardanelles, the first naval/air co-operation mission in history.

The United States Army used airplanes for scouting and communications in its 1916–1917 campaign against Pancho Villa. Air reconnaissance was carried out in both wars too. The air-dropped bomb was extensively used during the First Balkan War (including in the first night-bombing on 7 November 1912), and subsequently used by the Imperial German Air Service during World War I.

==World War I==


In World War I both sides initially made use of tethered balloons and airplanes for observation purposes, both for information gathering and directing of artillery fire. At first, enemy pilots simply exchanged hand waves, but a desire to prevent enemy observation led to airplane pilots attacking other airplanes and balloons, initially with small arms carried in the cockpit.

The addition of deflector plates to the back of propellers by French pilot Roland Garros and designer Raymond Saulnier in the Morane-Saulnier monoplane was the first example of an aircraft able to fire through its propeller, permitting Garros to score three victories in April 1915. Dutch aircraft designer Anthony Fokker developed a successful gun synchronizer in 1915, resulting in German &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens scoring the first known victory for a synchronized gun-equipped fighter aircraft, on July 1, 1915.

The Allies quickly developed their own synchronization gears, leading to the birth of &quot;aerial combat&quot;, more commonly known as dogfighting. Tactics for dogfighting evolved by trial and error. The German ace Oswald Boelcke created eight essential rules of dogfighting, the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot;.

Both sides also made use of aircraft for bombing, strafing, maritime reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, and the dropping of propaganda. The German military made use of Zeppelins and, later on, bombers such as the Gotha, to drop bombs on Southern England. By the end of the war airplanes had become specialized into bombers, fighters, and observation (reconnaissance) aircraft. By 1916, aerial combat had already progressed to the point where dogfighting tactics based on such doctrines as the &quot;Dicta Boelcke&quot; allowed air supremacy to be achieved. During the course of the war, new designs led to air supremacy shifting back and forth between the Germans and Allies.

==Interwar period==
Between 1918 and 1939 aircraft technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes with wooden frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines. Biplanes continued to be the mainstay of air forces around the world and were used extensively in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War. Most industrial countries also created air forces separate from the army and navy. However, by 1939 military biplanes were in the process of being replaced with metal framed monoplanes, often with stressed skins and liquid-cooled engines. Top speeds had tripled; altitudes doubled; ranges and payloads of bombers increased enormously.

Some theorists, especially in Britain, considered that aircraft would become the dominant military arm in the future. They imagined that a future war would be won entirely by the destruction of the enemy&#x27;s military and industrial capability from the air. The Italian general Giulio Douhet, author of &quot;The Command of the Air&quot;, was a seminal theorist of this school, which has been associated with Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s statement that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;; that is, regardless of air defences, sufficient raiders will survive to rain destruction on the enemy&#x27;s cities. This led to what would later be called a strategy of deterrence and a &quot;bomber gap&quot;, as nations measured air force power by number of bombers.

Others, such as General Billy Mitchell in the United States, saw the potential of air power to augment the striking power of naval surface fleets. German and British pilots had experimented with aerial bombing of ships and air-dropped torpedoes during World War I with mixed results. The vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft was demonstrated on 21 July 1921 when a squadron of bombers commanded by General Mitchell sank the ex-German battleship SMS &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; with aerial bombs; although the &quot;Ostfriesland&quot; was stationary and defenseless during the exercise, its destruction demonstrated the potency of air planes against ships.

It was during the Banana Wars, while fighting bandits, freedom fighters and insurgents in places like Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua that United States Marine Corps aviators began to experiment with air-ground tactics to support Marines on the ground. In Haiti the Marines began to experiment with dive bombing and in Nicaragua where they began to perfect it. While other nations and services had tried variations of this technique, Marine aviators were the first to include it in their tactical doctrine.

Germany was banned from possessing an air force by the terms of the World War I armistice. The German military continued to train its soldiers as pilots clandestinely until Hitler was ready to openly defy the ban. This was done by forming the &quot;Deutscher Luftsportverband&quot;, a flying enthusiast&#x27;s club, and training pilots as civilians, and some German pilots were even sent to the Soviet Union for secret training; a trained air force was thus ready as soon as the word was given. This was the beginning of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

==World War II==

Military aviation came into its own during World War II. The increased performance, range, and payload of contemporary aircraft meant that air power could move beyond the novelty applications of World War I, becoming a central striking force for all the combatant nations.

Over the course of the war, several distinct roles emerged for the application of air power.

===Strategic bombing===
Strategic bombing of civilian targets from the air was first proposed by the Italian theorist General Giulio Douhet. In his book &quot;The Command of the Air&quot; (1921), Douhet argued future military leaders could avoid falling into bloody World War I–style trench stalemates by using aviation to strike past the enemy&#x27;s forces directly at their vulnerable civilian populations. Douhet believed such strikes would cause these populations to force their governments to surrender.

Douhet&#x27;s ideas were paralleled by other military theorists who emerged from World War I, including Sir Hugh Trenchard in Britain. In the interwar period, Britain and the United States became the most enthusiastic supporters of the strategic bombing theory, with each nation building specialized heavy bombers specifically for this task.

;Japanese strategic bombing
Strategic bombing, mostly targeting large Chinese cities, was independently conducted during the Second Sino-Japanese war and World War II by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. There were also air raids on Philippines and Australia, as well as the cities in Burma and Malaysia. The Navy and Army air services used tactical bombing against ships and military positions, as at Pearl Harbor.

;Luftwaffe
In the early days of World War II, the Luftwaffe launched devastating air attacks against besieged cities. During the Battle of Britain, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, frustrated in its attempts to gain air superiority, turned to bombing British cities. However, these raids did not have the effect predicted by prewar theorists.

;Soviet Red Air Force
Although the rapid industrialization the Soviet Union experienced in the 1930s had the potential to enable the Soviet Air Forces to be effective against the Luftwaffe, Stalin&#x27;s purges left the organization weakened. However, when Germany invaded in June 1941, the size of the Soviet Air Forces allowed it to absorb horrendous casualties and still maintain capability. Despite the near collapse of Soviet forces in 1941, they survived, as German forces outran their supply lines and the Americans and British provided Lend Lease assistance.

Although strategic bombing requires that the enemy&#x27;s industrial war capacity be neutralized, some Soviet factories were moved far out of reach of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bombers. Because the Luftwaffe&#x27;s resources were needed to support the German army, the Luftwaffe became overstretched, and even victorious battles degraded Germany&#x27;s air force due to attrition. By 1943, the Soviets were able to produce considerably more airplanes than their German rivals; for example, at Kursk, the Soviets had twice the number of airplanes that the Luftwaffe had. Utilizing overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet forces were able to drive the Germans out of Soviet territory and take the war to Germany.

;Allied air forces in Europe
The British started a strategic bombing campaign in 1940 that was to last for the rest of the war. Early British bombers were all twin-engined designs, and the 1939 Battle of the Heligoland Bight had shown the vulnerability of bombers to fighter attack. Therefore, RAF Bomber Command turned to a policy of area bombing at night. Later in the war pathfinder tactics, radio location, ground mapping radar, and very low-level bombing enabled specific targets to be attacked.
When the USAAF arrived in England in 1942, the Americans were convinced they could carry out successful daylight raids. The U.S. Eighth Air Force was equipped with high-altitude four-engined designs. The new bombers also featured a stronger defensive armament. Flying in daylight in large formations, U.S. doctrine held tactical formations of heavy bombers would be sufficient to gain air superiority without escort fighters. The intended raids would hit hard on chokepoints in the German war economy such as oil refineries or ball bearing factories.

The USAAF was compelled to change its doctrine since bombers alone, no matter how heavily armed, could not achieve air superiority against single-engined fighters. In a series of missions in 1943 that penetrated beyond the range of fighter cover, there were loss rates up to twenty percent. The Allies lost 160,000 airmen and 33,700 planes during World War II, and almost 68,000 U.S. airmen died.

;Air superiority
During the Battle of Britain, many of the best &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots had been forced to bail out over British soil, where they were captured. As the quality of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter arm decreased, the Americans introduced the long-range escort fighters, carrying drop tanks such as the North American P-51 Mustang. Newer, inexperienced German pilots—flying potentially superior aircraft, gradually became less and less effective at thinning the late-war bomber streams. Adding fighters to the daylight raids gave the bombers much-needed protection and greatly improved the impact of the strategic bombing effort.

Over time, from 1942 to 1944, the Allies&#x27; air forces became stronger while the Luftwaffe weakened. During 1944, Germany&#x27;s air force lost control of Germany&#x27;s skies. As a result, nothing in Germany could be protected whether it was army units, factories, civilians in cities, or even the nation&#x27;s capital. German soldiers and civilians began to be slaughtered in the tens of thousands by aerial bombardment.

;Effectiveness
Strategic bombing by non-atomic means did not however win the war for the Allies, nor did it succeed in breaking the will to resist of the German (and Japanese) people. But in the words of the German armaments minister Albert Speer, it created &quot;a second front in the air.&quot; Speer succeeded in increasing the output of armaments right up to mid-1944 in spite of the bombing. Still, the war against the British and American bombers demanded enormous amounts of resources: antiaircraft guns, day and night fighters, radars, searchlights, manpower, ammunition, and fuel.

On the Allied side, strategic bombing diverted material resources, equipment (such as radar) aircraft, and manpower away from the Battle of the Atlantic and Allied armies. As a result, German army groups in Russia, Italy, and France rarely saw friendly aircraft and constantly ran short of tanks, trucks, and anti-tank weapons.

;U.S. Bombing of Japan
In June 1944, Boeing B-29 Superfortresses launched from China, bombed Japanese factories. From November 1944, increasingly intense raids were launched from bases closer to Japan. Tactics evolved from high-altitude to lower altitude attacks, largely removing most defensive guns and switching to incendiary bombs. These attacks devastated many Japanese cities.

In August 1945, B-29 Superfortresses dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki while the Soviets invaded Manchuria. The Japanese then surrendered unconditionally, officially ending World War II.

===Tactical air support===

By contrast with the British strategists, the primary purpose of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was to support the Army. This accounted for the presence of large numbers of medium bombers and dive bombers on strength and the scarcity of long-range heavy bombers. This &#x27;flying artillery&#x27; greatly assisted in the successes of the German Army in the Battle of France (1940) . Hitler determined air superiority was essential for the invasion of Britain. When this was not achieved in the Battle of Britain, the invasion was canceled, making this the first major battle whose outcome was determined primarily in the air.

The war in Russia forced the Luftwaffe to devote the majority of its resources to providing tactical air support for the beleaguered German army. In that role, the Luftwaffe used the Junkers Ju 87, Henschel Hs 123 and modified fighters such as Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s.

The Red Air Force was also primarily used in the tactical support role, and towards the end of the war was very effective in the support of the Red Army in its advance across Eastern Europe. An aircraft of major importance to the Soviets was the &quot;Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik&quot; &quot;flying artillery&quot; which made life very difficult for panzer crews, and the Il-2 played an important part in the Soviet victory in one of the biggest tank battles in history at Kursk.

===Military transport and use of airborne troops===
Military transport was invaluable to all sides in maintaining supply and communications of ground troops, and was used on many notable occasions such as resupply of German troops in and around Stalingrad after Operation Uranus, and employment of airborne troops. After the first trials in use of airborne troops by the Red Army displayed in the early 1930s many European nations and Japan also formed airborne troops, and these saw extensive service on in all theatres of the Second World War.

However their effectiveness as shock troops employed to surprise enemy static troops proved to be of limited success. Most airborne troops served as light infantry by the end of the war despite attempts at massed use in the Western Theatre by US and Britain during Operation Market Garden.

===Naval aviation===
Aircraft and the aircraft carrier first became important in naval battles in World War II. Carrier-based aircraft were specialized as dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters.

Surface-based aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland helped finding submarines and surface fleets. The aircraft carrier replaced the battleship as the most powerful naval offensive weapons system as battles between fleets were increasingly fought out of gun range by aircraft. The Yamato, the most powerful battleship ever built was first turned back by light escort carrier aircraft, and later sunk due to it lacking its own air cover.

The US launched US Army Air Forces land-based bombers from United States Navy carriers in a raid against Tokyo. Smaller carriers were built in large numbers to escort slow cargo convoys or supplement fast carriers. Aircraft for observation or light raids were also carried by battleships and cruisers, while blimps were used to search for attack submarines.

In the Battle of the Atlantic, aircraft carried by low-cost escort carriers were used for antisubmarine patrol, defense, and attack. At the start of the Pacific War in 1941, Japanese carrier-based aircraft sank several US battleships at Pearl Harbor and land-based aircraft sank two large British warships. Engagements between Japanese and American naval fleets were then conducted largely or entirely by aircraft including the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, Bismarck Sea and Philippine Sea.

==Cold War==
Military aviation in the post-war years was dominated by the needs of the Cold War. The post-war years saw the almost total conversion of combat aircraft to jet power, which resulted in enormous increases in speeds and altitudes of aircraft. Until the advent of the intercontinental ballistic missile major powers relied on high-altitude bombers to deliver their newly developed nuclear deterrent and each country strove to develop the technology of bombers and the high-altitude fighters that could intercept them. The concept of air superiority began to play a heavy role in aircraft designs for both the United States and the Soviet Union.

The Americans developed and made extensive use of the high-altitude observation aircraft for intelligence-gathering. The Lockheed U-2, and later the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird were developed in great secrecy. The U-2 at its time was expected to be invulnerable to defensive measures due to its extreme altitude capabilities. It therefore came as a shock when the Soviets downed one piloted by Gary Powers with a surface-to-air missile.

Air combat was also transformed through increased use of air-to-air guided missiles with increased sophistication in guidance and increased range. In the 1970s and 1980s it became clear that speed and altitude was not enough to protect a bomber against air defences. The emphasis shifted therefore to maneuverable attack aircraft that could fly &#x27;under the radar&#x27;, at altitudes of a few hundred feet.

===Korean War===


The Korean War was best remembered for jet combat, but was one of the last major wars where propeller-powered fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang, Vought F4U Corsair and aircraft carrier-based Hawker Sea Fury and Supermarine Seafire were used. Turbojet fighter aircraft such as Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars, Republic F-84 Thunderjets and Grumman F9F Panthers came to dominate the skies, overwhelming North Korea&#x27;s propeller-driven Yakovlev Yak-9s and Lavochkin La-9s.

From 1950, North Koreans flew the Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters which introduced the near-sonic speeds of swept wings to air combat. Though an open secret during the war, the most formidable pilots today now admit that they were experienced Soviet Air Force pilots, a &quot;casus belli&quot; deliberately overlooked by the UN allied forces who suspected the use of Russians but were reluctant to engage in open war with the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

At first, UN jet fighters, which also included Royal Australian Air Force Gloster Meteors, had some success, but straight winged jets were soon outclassed in daylight by the superior speed of the MiGs. At night, however, radar-equipped Marine Corps Douglas F3D Skynight night fighters claimed five MiG kills with no losses of their own, and no B-29s under their escort were lost to enemy fighters.

In December 1950, the United States Air Force rushed in their own swept-wing fighter, the North American F-86 Sabre. The MiG could fly higher, 50,000 vs. , offering a distinct advantage at the start of combat. In level flight, their maximum speeds were comparable at about . The MiG could climb better, while the Sabre could dive better with an all-flying tailplane. For weapons, the MiG carried two 23 mm and one 37 mm cannon, compared to the Sabre&#x27;s six .50 (12.7 mm) caliber machine guns. The American .50 caliber machine guns, while not packing the same punch, carried many more rounds and were aimed with a more accurate radar-ranging gunsight. The U.S. pilots also had the advantage of G-suits, which were used for the first time in this war.

Even after the Air Force introduced the advanced F-86, its pilots often struggled against the jets piloted by Soviet pilots, dubbed &quot;honchos&quot;. The UN gradually gained air superiority over most of Korea that lasted until the end of the war. It was a decisive factor in helping the UN first advance into the north, and then resist the Chinese invasion of South Korea.

After the war, the USAF claimed 792 MiG-15s and 108 additional aircraft shot down by Sabres for the loss of 78 Sabres. Later research reduced the total to 379 victories which is still higher than the 345 losses shown in USSR records.

The Soviets claimed about 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 combat MiG losses at that time. China&#x27;s official losses were 231 planes shot down in air-to-air combat (mostly MiG-15s) and 168 other losses. The number of losses of the North Korean Air Force was not revealed. It is estimated that it lost about 200 aircraft in the first stage of the war, and another 70 aircraft after Chinese intervention.

Soviet claims of 650 victories over the Sabres, and China&#x27;s claims of another 211 F-86s, are considered to be exaggerated by the USAF.

The Korean war was the first time the helicopter was used extensively in a conflict. While helicopters such as the Sikorsky YR-4 were used in World War II, their use was rare, and Jeeps like the Willys MB were the main method of removing an injured soldier. In the Korean war helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 partially took over in the non combat Medevac area.

===Indo-Pakistani Wars===
During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, both air forces engaged each other for the first time in full scale combat since independence. Both countries hold contradictory combat loss claims for the war and no neutral sources have verified them. The Pakistani Air Force (PAF) claimed 104 Indian Air Force (IAF) aircraft while losing only 19 in the process. India meanwhile claims they lost 35 aircraft while shooting down 73 Pakistani aircraft. During the war, the numerically larger IAF, was not able to achieve any air superiority over qualitatively superior Pakistan Air Force. Thus the war was effectively a stalemate.

By the time of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Indian Air force had both the numerical as well as qualitative edge. Newly procured Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s and Sukhoi Su-7 were also inducted into service. On the other side of the border the PAF had successfully inducted new aircraft such as the Shenyang J-6 and Dassault Mirage III. The war began with Operation Chengiz Khan, Pakistan&#x27;s December 3, 1971 pre-emptive strike on 11 Indian airbases. After the initial pre-emptive strike, the PAF adopted a defensive stance in response to the Indian retaliation. As the war progressed, the Indian Air Force continued to fight the PAF over conflict zones, but the number of sorties flown by the PAF gradually decreased day-by-day. The Indian Air Force flew 4,000 sorties while its counterpart, the PAF offered 3,300 in retaliation, partly because of shortages of non-Bengali technical personnel. In East Pakistan, the lone No. 14 Squadron &quot;Tail Choppers&quot; of the PAF pitched against ten IAF Squadrons was ultimately grounded, when the Tezgaon airfield in Dhaka (Dacca) was put out of commission after seven days of repeated bombings by Indian MiG-21s, Hunters and Su-7s, and consequently allowed the IAF to attain air superiority in the East.

===Vietnam War===


The Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) was originally equipped with helicopters such as the Piasecki CH-21 and propeller powered aircraft such as the North American T-28 Trojan when jet aircraft were disallowed by treaty. As US involvement increased, most aircraft were flown by US forces.

Large scale use of helicopters by the US Army in Vietnam led to a new class of airmobile troops, and the introduction of &quot;Air Cavalry&quot; in the U.S., culminating in extensive use of the Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter which would become a symbol of that war, while the Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe &quot;Skycrane&quot; and Boeing-Vertol CH-47 Chinook lifted heavier loads such as vehicles or artillery. Troops were able to land unexpectedly, strike, and leave again, and evacuate wounded. The specialized AH-1 Cobra was developed from the Huey for escort and ground support duties, The later Soviet campaign in Afghanistan would also see widespread use of helicopters as part of the air assault brigades and regiments.

US forces provided close support of ground force over South Vietnam, and strategic bombing of targets over North Vietnam. Many types flying close support or COIN (Counter Insurgency Warfare) missions were propeller powered types such as the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and North American OV-10 Bronco FAC spotters, Douglas A-1 Skyraider, Douglas B-26 Invader, and Douglas AC-47 Spooky gunship. Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports flew supplies into battlefields such as Khe Sanh.

&quot;Fast movers&quot; included the supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabre, while the giant Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be modified to unload a massive high explosive payload on enemy troop concentrations. The Lockheed AC-130 would become the ultimate gunship, while the AX specification to replace the Skyraider would evolve into the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II.

USAF Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs flew the bulk of strike missions against North Vietnam in Operation Rolling Thunder, while carrier-based Douglas A-4 Skyhawks (which could &quot;buddy-buddy&quot; refuel) were flown by the Navy. That first campaign was marred by carefully measured regulations that prohibited attacks against SAM missile sites and fighter bases, and frequent bombing halts, and produced little in political results. Rolling Thunder saw the first combat use of electronic computers aboard PIRAZ ships to display comprehensive real-time aircraft position information for force commanders.
Lessons learned were applied to the later Operation Linebacker which employed McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, B-52 Stratofortresses, swing-wing General Dynamics F-111 Aardvarks, LTV A-7 Corsair IIs and all-weather Grumman A-6 Intruders was more successful in bringing North Vietnam to the negotiating table after a massive ground invasion. North Vietnam effectively combined Soviet and Chinese anti-aircraft artillery, SA-2 guided missiles, and MiG fighters to create the most heavily defended airspace up to that time.

US air strikes would combine the use of airborne radar platforms such as the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers for air refueling, radar jamming aircraft and specialized &quot;Wild Weasel&quot; units to attack SAM missile sites. Jolly Green Giant helicopter crews escorted by Douglas A-1 Skyraiders (&quot;Sandy&quot;s) would retrieve downed pilots over hostile territory. With the use of &quot;smart&quot; guided bombs late in the war, this would set the model for future US air operations.

Experts were surprised when advanced F-105s were shot down in its first encounter against the elderly but nimble MiG-17. Dogfights were thought to be obsolete in the age of missiles, but pilots now needed maneuverability. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was quickly tasked with protecting against MiGs, but lacked a built-in gun when missiles were still very unreliable. Air combat training schools such as TOPGUN would improve kill ratios, but combat experience started programs that would produce agile air superiority fighters with guns such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle by the 1970s.

South Vietnam fell without US air support when faced with a massive assault in 1975. The VNAF Republic of Vietnam Air Force was never supplied with powerful fighters and bombers such as the F-4 Phantom and B-52 which could strike at North Vietnam.

===Middle East===
In the Six-Day War of 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched pre-emptive strikes which destroyed opposing Arab air forces on the ground. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 saw the Arab deployment of mobile 2K12 Kub (SA-6) missiles which proved effective against low-flying Israeli aircraft until they were neutralized by ground forces.

===Iran–Iraq War===
In the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), the use of aerial warfare was continuous. At the war&#x27;s beginning Iraq attempted to destroy the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force by bombing its airfields but failed due to lack of pilot training and Iranian air base defenses. The war also saw the first helicopter vs. helicopter engagements between the Iraqi and Iranian air forces.

===Falklands War (1982)===

During the six-week Falklands War British carrier-based British Aerospace Sea Harrier and Hawker Siddeley Harrier flew over 1500 sorties and Avro Vulcans flew long-range bombing missions. 21 Argentine fixed-aircraft were destroyed in the air by British Harriers and Sea Harriers. A further 18 Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed by British Surface to Air Missiles. 15 Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 14 were captured. Sixty eight Argentine fixed-wing aircraft were captured or destroyed by British Forces, representing 28% of the 240 fixed-wing aircraft the Argentinians had at the start of the war. When accidents and friendly fire are included, 31% of the total 240 fixed-wing aircraft were lost.

==Post Cold War==

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 forced Western air forces to undergo a shift from the massive numbers felt to be necessary during the Cold War to smaller numbers of multi-role aircraft. The closure of several military bases overseas and the U.S. Base Realignment and Closure program have served to highlight the effectiveness of aircraft carriers in the absence of dedicated military or air force&#x27;s bases, as the Falklands War and U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf have highlighted.

The advent of precision-guided munitions have allowed for strikes at arbitrary surface targets once proper reconnaissance is performed (network-centric warfare).

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has noted that sales of combat aircraft can have a destabilizing effect because of their ability to quickly strike neighboring countries, such as during Operation Orchard in 2007 when the Israelis unilaterally attacked Syria.

===Gulf War (1991)===

The role of air power in modern warfare was dramatically demonstrated during the Gulf War in 1991. Air attacks were made on Iraqi command and control centers, communications facilities, supply depots, and reinforcement forces. Air superiority over Iraq was gained before major ground combat began.

The initial strikes were composed of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from ships, Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers with an armament of laser-guided bombs, and aircraft armed with anti-radar missiles. These first attacks destroyed the air defence network and allowed fighter-bombers to gain air superiority over the country.

Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt IIs attacked Iraqi armored forces with Gatling guns and Maverick missiles, supporting the advance of US ground troops. Attack helicopters, fired laser guided Hellfire missiles and TOW missiles. The allied air fleet also made use of AWACS aircraft and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers.

The aerial strike force was made up of over 2,250 combat aircraft, which included 1,800 US aircraft, which fought against an Iraqi force of about 500 primarily composed of MiG-29 and Mirage F1 fighters. More than 88,000 combat missions had been flown by allied forces with over 88,000 tons of bombs dropped by the end of the fifth week.

===Kargil War (1999)===
On 11 May 1999, the Indian Air Force was called in to provide helicopters for close air support to the Indian Army at the height of the Kargil conflict with Pakistan. PAF was not a party in this conflict therefore entire IAF effort remained concentrated on unopposed ground operations. The first strikes were launched on the 26 May, when the Indian Air Force struck infiltrator positions with fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships. The initial strikes saw MiG-27s carrying out offensive sorties, with MiG-21s and MiG-29s providing fighter cover. The IAF also deployed radars and MiG-29 fighters to keep check on Pakistani military movements across the border.

On 27 May, the IAF lost a MiG-21 to enemy action and a MiG-27 to mechanical failure. The following day, a Mi-17 was lost to SAMs while on an offensive sortie. These losses forced the IAF to withdraw helicopters from offensive roles. On 30 May, the IAF called into operation the Mirage 2000 which was deemed the best aircraft in the high-altitude conditions. Mirage 2000s not only had better defence equipment compared to the MiGs, but also gave IAF the ability to carry out aerial raids at night. Indian MiG-29s were used extensively during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir by the Indian Air Force to provide fighter escort for Mirage 2000s, which were attacking targets with laser-guided bombs. Kargil Conflict finally came to end with a Decisive Indian Military and Diplomatic Victory.

===Eritrean–Ethiopian War (1998–2000)===

The war became the first to see 4th-generation jet fighters battle with each other. Most of the losses to Eritrean MIG-29s were caused by dogfights with Ethiopian Su-27s.
===Iraq War (2003–2011)===
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq led by US and British forces putatively to defeat the regime of Saddam Hussein, aerial warfare continued to be decisive. The US-British alliance began its air campaign on March 19 with limited nighttime bombing on the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Several days later, intensive bombardment began. About 14,000 sorties were flown, and at a cost of $1 million each, 800 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at numerous targets in Iraq from March 19 until mid-April 2003. By this time Iraqi resistance had largely ended.

Iraqi anti-aircraft weapons were unable to open fire on high-altitude US bombers such as the B-52 or stealth aircraft such as the B-2 bomber and the F-117A. US and British aircraft used radar-detecting devices and aerial reconnaissance to locate Iraqi anti-aircraft weapons. Bunker buster bombs, designed to penetrate and destroy underground bunkers, were dropped on Iraqi command and control centers. Iraqi ground forces could not seriously challenge the American ground forces because of their air supremacy. By mid-April 2003, US-British forces controlled all of Iraq&#x27;s major cities and oil fields.

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===
In the beginning of the 2006 Lebanon War, Israel utilized an intensive aerial campaign aimed to eliminate Hezbollah and destroy its military, as stated by Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. It also aimed to return kidnapped Israeli soldiers. The campaign started by destroying Lebanese infrastructure and Hezbollah targets. This continued during the 33 days of the war.

Taking into consideration the results of the 1991 and 2003 wars on Iraq and the 1999 war on the former Yugoslavia, the Israeli air force was unable to accomplish its objectives as completely. This partly results from the military doctrine that Hezbollah used in the war which proved effective. There have also been reports during the conflict that a Hezbollah-operated flying drone penetrated Israeli airspace, and returned to Lebanese territory.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
The Russo-Ukrainian War became in 2022 the first conflict in two decades to feature large-scale aerial warfare.

Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has seen a rise in a new type of aerial warfare involving small, commercially available civilian drones (generally quadcopters) that have been modified to attack enemy positions such as those in buildings, vehicles, and trenches. These attacks are often done by modifying these drones to be able to drop explosives such as grenades, or equipping the drone with explosives and flying it directly towards enemies to self-destruct.

This differs from previous warfare involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in that these drones are readily available in large quantities, easily accessible to civilian populations, and require substantially less space and resources to operate compared to traditional larger, fixed-wing UAVs. Apart from being far more accessible to civilian combatants and carrying little to no risk of casualties for the attacking side, they provide the added benefit of quick, high-precision attacks at a fraction of the cost of traditional UAVs. This makes them ideal for the type of urban warfare seen throughout the conflict in Ukraine. The majority of these types of attacks are from Ukrainians against Russian invaders.

<text>The Sun Sentinel (also known as the South Florida Sun Sentinel, known until 2008 as the Sun-Sentinel, and stylized on its masthead as SunSentinel) is the main daily newspaper of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Broward County, and covers Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties and state-wide news, as well. It is the 4th largest-circulation newspaper in Florida. Paul Pham has held the position of general manager since November 2020, and Julie Anderson has held the position of editor-in-chief since February 2018.

The newspaper was for many years branded as the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;, with a hyphen, until a redesign and rebranding on August 17, 2008. The new look also removed the space between &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Sentinel&quot; in the newspaper&#x27;s flag, but its name retained the space.

The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; is owned by the parent company, &quot;Tribune Publishing&quot;. This company was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media, in May 2021.

==Overview==
The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; emphasizes local news, through its Community News and Local sections. It has a daily circulation of 163,728 and a Sunday circulation of 228,906.

For many years, the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; targeted Broward County and provided only limited news coverage in Palm Beach County. However, in the late 1990s, it expanded its coverage to all of South Florida, including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. In Miami, &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; is its primary competition, while in Palm Beach County, &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; is the chief competition.

The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; website has news video from two South Florida television stations: West Palm Beach&#x27;s CBS affiliate WPEC and Miami and Fort Lauderdale CW affiliate WSFL-TV; it was a former sister station to the latter before Tribune&#x27;s publishing and broadcasting interests were split. It also publishes a Spanish-language weekly, &quot;El Sentinel&quot;, as well as various community publications.

==History==
The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; traces its history to the 1910 founding of the &quot;Fort Lauderdale Weekly Herald&quot;, the first known newspaper in the Fort Lauderdale area, and the &quot;Everglades Breeze&quot;, a locally printed paper founded in 1911, which promoted itself as &quot;Florida&#x27;s great Farm, Truck and Fruit Growing paper.&quot; In 1925, the &quot;Everglades Breeze&quot; was renamed the &quot;Sentinel&quot;. That same year, two Ohio publishers bought both the &quot;Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Herald&quot;, consolidating the newspapers into a daily publication called the &quot;Daily News and Evening Sentinel&quot;. In 1926, Horace and Tom Stillwell purchased the paper. However, the devastation wrought by the 1926 Miami hurricane caused circulation to drop and, in 1929, Tom Stillwell sold the paper to the Gore Publishing Company, headed by R.H. Gore Sr. By 1945, circulation of the &quot;Daily News and Evening Sentinel&quot; had climbed to 10,000.

In 1953, Gore Publishing changed the name of the paper to the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News&quot; and added a Sunday morning edition. In 1960, when the paper had a circulation of 60,000, Gore Publishing purchased the weekly &quot;Pompano Beach Sun&quot; and expanded it into a six-day morning paper, the &quot;Pompano Sun-Sentinel&quot;—thus reviving the &quot;Sentinel&quot; name it had discarded seven years earlier. In 1963, the Tribune Company acquired Gore Publishing. In the 1970s, the morning paper changed its name to the &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel&quot;. In 1982, the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News&quot; and &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel&quot; merged their editorial staffs. The two papers then merged into a single morning paper under the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel name. In 2000, after expanding its coverage, the paper changed its name to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

In 2001, the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; opened a full-time foreign bureau in Havana, Cuba. Shared with the Tribune Co., their Havana newsroom was the only permanent presence of any South Florida newspaper at the time.

In 2002, the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; began publishing a Spanish weekly newspaper, &quot;El Sentinel.&quot; The newspaper is distributed free on Saturdays to Hispanic households in Broward and Palm Beach counties and is also available in racks in both counties. It is also available online at Elsentinel.com. In 2004, the paper won the Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism for its coverage of health and human services in the state.

On August 17, 2008, the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; unveiled a redesigned layout, with larger graphics, more color, and a new large &quot;S&quot; logo. This is in tune with another Tribune newspaper (&quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;), which redesigned its newspaper a few months previously, and created a brand synergy with Tribune&#x27;s sister operation and CW affiliate WSFL-TV (Channel 39), which relocated its operations to the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; offices in 2008 and adopted a logo matching the capital &quot;S&quot; in the new logo.

From 2011 to the present day, the newspaper made significant updates to meld print media with modern media. These advances include: launching the pure-play entertainment website SouthFlorida.com and starting a video channel called &quot;SunSentinel Originals&quot;. As a result of their media integration, the newspaper was named one of &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot;&#x27;s &quot;10 Newspapers That Do it Right&quot;. Most recently, the company had signed a deal with Gannett in order to print eight newspapers from the company, which included &quot;USA Today&quot;.

In July 2024, the journalists at the paper announced their intention to unionize.

==Awards==
The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; gives annual awards to area businesses and business leaders, including Top Workplaces for People on the Move, Excalibur Award, and others.

In April 2013, the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; won its first gold medal in the category of Public Service Journalism, for its investigative series about off-duty police officers who engage in regular reckless speeding.

In 2014 the newspaper was named one of the &quot;10 Newspapers That Do It Right&quot; by &quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; magazine.

The &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; won its second Pulitzer for Public Service in 2019 for public service for its coverage of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, with The Pulitzer committee crediting the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; &quot;for exposing failings by school and law enforcement officials before and after the deadly shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.&quot;

The newspaper has also been a finalist for a Pulitzer 13 times, including for its 2005 coverage of Hurricane Wilma and an investigation into the Federal Emergency Management Agency&#x27;s mismanagement of hurricane aid. (The latter investigation was featured in the PBS documentary series &quot;Exposé: America&#x27;s Investigative Reports&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Crisis Mismanagement&quot;.) It also produced a significant contribution to information graphics in the form of News Illustrated, a weekly full-page graphic that has received more than 30 international awards. The photography department has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize twice in the Spot News category. It was a finalist in 1982 for its coverage of a Haitian refugee boat disaster, and again in 1999 for its powerful coverage of Hurricane Mitch in Central America.

In September 2008, a Bloomberg L.P. employee saw a six-year-old &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article posted on the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot;″s website about United Airlines&#x27; 2002 filing for bankruptcy and, due to its unclear display, mistakenly thought it was a recent story. The employee then added it as a headline on Bloomberg Terminals. The story then made it onto Google News&#x27; front page as well. As a result, there was a massive selloff of United Airlines stock, and its share price temporarily dropped &quot;from $12 to $3 before trading was suspended.&quot; Several days later, the SEC launched a formal &quot;preliminary investigation&quot; into the matter.

Since 2018, the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; has been preventing internet users in the European Union from accessing its website, on grounds of missing data protection compliance.

Following the re-election of Governor Ron DeSantis in 2022, a &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; editorial critical of DeSantis originally referred to Florida as a &quot;crimson hellscape&quot;, although the wording in its online version was quickly changed to &quot;crimson landscape&quot;.

<doc id="715882" wikidata="Q4127183" url="?curid=715882" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency">
<text>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which produces a higher than normal amount of androgen, resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11β-hydroxylase (11β-OH) which mediates the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11β-OH CAH results in hypertension due to excessive mineralocorticoid effects. It also causes excessive androgen production both before and after birth and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex.

==Presentation==

===Mineralocorticoid effects===
Mineralocorticoid manifestations of severe 11β-hydroxylase deficient CAH can be biphasic, changing from deficiency (salt-wasting) in early infancy to excess (hypertension) in childhood and adult life.

Salt-wasting in early infancy does not occur in most cases of 11β-OH CAH but can occur because of impaired production of aldosterone aggravated by the inefficiency of salt conservation in early infancy. When it occurs it resembles the salt-wasting of severe 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH: poor weight gain and vomiting in the first weeks of life progress and culminate in life-threatening dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the first month.

Despite the inefficient production of aldosterone, the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11β-OH CAH is hypertension. Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess: salt retention, volume expansion, and hypertension.

===Sex steroid effects===
Because 11β-hydroxylase activity is not necessary for the production of sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), the hyperplastic adrenal cortex produces excessive amounts of DHEA, androstenedione, and especially testosterone.

These androgens produce effects that are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH. In the severe forms, XX (genetically female) fetuses can be markedly virilized, with ambiguous genitalia that look more male than female, though internal female organs, including ovaries and uterus develop normally.

XY fetuses (genetic males) typically show no abnormal features related to androgen excess. A megalopenis (&gt;22 cm/8.7in) is usually present in male patients.

In milder mutations, androgen effects in both sexes appear in mid-childhood as early pubic hair, overgrowth, and accelerated bone age. Although &quot;nonclassic&quot; forms causing hirsutism and menstrual irregularities and appropriate steroid elevations have been reported, most have not had verifiable mutations, and mild 11β-hydroxylase deficient CAH is currently considered a very rare cause of hirsutism and infertility.

All of the issues related to virilization, neonatal assignment, advantages and disadvantages of genital surgery, childhood and adult virilization, gender identity, and sexual orientation are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase CAH and elaborated in more detail in Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

==Pathophysiology==

The enzyme that mediates 11β-hydroxylase activity is now known as P450c11β since it is one of the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of cells of the adrenal cortex. It is coded by a gene at 8q21-22. Like the other forms of CAH, several different defective alleles for the gene have been identified, producing varying degrees of impaired 11β-hydroxylase activity. Also like the other forms of CAH, 11β-OH CAH is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease.

11β-Hydroxylase mediates the final step of the glucocorticoid pathway, producing cortisol from 11-deoxycortisol. It also catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to corticosterone in the mineralocorticoid pathway.
==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
&quot;Congenital adrenal hyperplasia&quot; (CAH) refers to any of several autosomal recessive diseases resulting from defects in steps of the synthesis of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal glands. All of the forms of CAH involve excessive or defective production of sex steroids and can prevent or impair the development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in affected infants, children, and adults. Many also involve excessive or defective production of mineralocorticoids, which can cause hypertension or salt wasting, respectively.

The most common type of CAH is due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. 11β-Hydroxylase deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia is one of the less common types of CAH due to deficiencies of other proteins and enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis. Other uncommon types are described in individual articles (links below).

11β-OH CAH resembles 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH in its androgenic manifestations: partial virilization and ambiguous genitalia of genetically female infants, childhood virilization of both sexes, and rarer cases of virilization or infertility of adolescent and adult women. The mineralocorticoid effect differs: hypertension is usually the clinical clue that a patient has 11- rather than 21-hydroxylase CAH. Diagnosis of 11β-OH CAH is usually confirmed by demonstration of marked elevations of 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), the substrates of 11β-hydroxylase. Management is similar to that of 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH except that mineralocorticoids need not be replaced.

==Management==
As with other forms of CAH, the primary therapy of 11β-hydroxylase deficient CAH is lifelong glucocorticoid replacement in sufficient doses to prevent adrenal insufficiency and suppress excess mineralocorticoid and androgen production.

Salt-wasting in infancy responds to intravenous saline, dextrose, and high dose hydrocortisone, but prolonged fludrocortisone replacement is usually not necessary. The hypertension is ameliorated by glucocorticoid suppression of DOC.

Long-term glucocorticoid replacement issues are similar to those of 21-hydroxylase CAH and involve careful balance between doses sufficient to suppress androgens while avoiding suppression of growth. Because the enzyme defect does not affect sex steroid synthesis, gonadal function at puberty and long-term fertility should be normal if adrenal androgen production is controlled. See congenital adrenal hyperplasia for a more detailed discussion of androgen suppression and fertility potential in adolescent and adult women.

<doc id="715886" wikidata="Q2434524" url="?curid=715886" title="Time-to-digital converter">
<text>In electronic instrumentation and signal processing, a time-to-digital converter (TDC) or time digitizer (TD) is a device for recognizing events and providing a digital representation of the time they occurred. For example, a TDC might output the time of arrival for each incoming pulse. Some applications wish to measure the time interval between two events rather than some notion of an absolute time, and the digitizer is then used to measure a time interval and convert it into digital (binary) output. In some cases, an interpolating TDC is also called a time counter (TC).

When TDCs are used to determine the time interval between two signal pulses (known as start and stop pulse), measurement is started and stopped when the rising or falling edge of a signal pulse crosses a set threshold. This pattern is seen in many physical experiments, like time-of-flight and lifetime measurements in atomic and high energy physics, experiments that involve laser ranging and electronic research involving the testing of integrated circuits and high-speed data transfer.

Several methods exist for time digitization. Some types allow for nanosecond accuracy, while other are capable of picosecond accuracy (see Coarse measurement and Fine measurement sections below, respectively).

==Application==
TDCs are used to timestamp events and measure time differences between events, especially where picosecond precision and high accuracy is required, such as the measurement of events in high energy physics experiments, where particles (e.g. electrons, photons, and ions) are detected.

Another application is cost-effective and non-mechanical water flow metering by measuring the time difference between ultrasound pulses that travel through the flow and arrive at different times depending on the flow speed and direction.

In an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), a TDC measures the phase shift and its result is used to adjust the digital controlled oscillator (DCO).

==Coarse measurement==
If the required time resolution is not high (nanosecond resolution?), then counters can be used to make the conversion.

===Basic counter===
In its simplest implementation, a TDC is simply a high-frequency counter that increments every clock cycle. The current contents of the counter represents the current time. When an event occurs, the counter&#x27;s value is captured in an output register.

In that approach, the measurement is an integer number of clock cycles, so the measurement is quantized to a clock period. To get finer resolution, a faster clock is needed. The accuracy of the measurement depends upon the stability of the clock frequency.

Typically a TDC uses a crystal oscillator reference frequency for good long term stability. High stability crystal oscillators are usually relative low frequency such as 10 MHz (or 100 ns resolution). To get better resolution, a phase-locked loop frequency multiplier can be used to generate a faster clock. One might, for example, multiply the crystal reference oscillator by 100 to get a clock rate of 1 GHz (1 ns resolution).

====Counter technology====
High clock rates impose additional design constraints on the counter: if the clock period is short, it is difficult to update the count. Binary counters, for example, need a fast carry architecture because they essentially add one to the previous counter value. A solution is using a hybrid counter architecture. A Johnson counter, for example, is a fast non-binary counter. It can be used to count very quickly the low order count; a more conventional binary counter can be used to accumulate the high order count. The fast counter is sometime called a prescaler.

The speed of counters fabricated in CMOS-technology is limited by the capacitance between the gate and the channel and by the resistance of the channel and the signal traces. The product of both is the cut-off-frequency. Modern chip technology allows multiple metal layers and therefore coils with a large number of windings to be inserted into the chip.
This allows designers to peak the device for a specific frequency, which may lie above the cut-off-frequency of the original transistor.

A peaked variant of the Johnson counter is the traveling-wave counter which also achieves sub-cycle resolution. Other methods to achieve sub-cycle resolution include analog-to-digital converters and vernier Johnson counters.

====Measuring a time interval====
In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an absolute time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, i.e the time between a start event and a stop event.

That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time of both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts.

The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event.

Coarse counters base on a reference clock with signals generated at a stable frequency formula_1. When the start signal is detected the counter starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval formula_2 between start and stop is then

:formula_3

with formula_4, the number of counts and formula_5, the period of the reference clock.

===Statistical counter===
Since start, stop and clock signal are asynchronous, there is a uniform probability distribution of the start and stop signal-times between two subsequent clock pulses. This detuning of the start and stop signal from the clock pulses is called quantization error.

For a series of measurements on the same constant and asynchronous time interval one measures two different numbers of counted clock pulses formula_6 and formula_7 (see picture). These occur with probabilities

:formula_8
:formula_9

with formula_10 the fractional part of formula_11. The value for the time interval is then obtained by

:formula_12

Measuring a time interval using a coarse counter with the averaging method described above is relatively time consuming because of the many repetitions that are needed to determine the probabilities formula_13 and formula_14. In comparison to the other methods described later on, a coarse counter has a very limited resolution (1 ns in case of a 1 GHz reference clock), but satisfies with its theoretically unlimited measuring range.

==Fine measurement==

In contrast to the coarse counter in the previous section, fine measurement methods with much better accuracy (picosecond resolution?), but far smaller measuring range are presented here. Analogue methods like time interval stretching or double conversion as well as digital methods like tapped delay lines and the Vernier method are under examination. Though the analogue methods still obtain better accuracies, digital time interval measurement is often preferred due to its flexibility in integrated circuit technology and its robustness against external perturbations like temperature changes.

The counter implementation&#x27;s accuracy is limited by the clock frequency. If time is measured by whole counts, then the resolution is limited to the clock period. For example, a 10 MHz clock has a resolution of 100 ns. To get resolution finer than a clock period, there are time interpolation circuits. These circuits measure the fraction of a clock period: that is, the time between a clock event and the event being measured. The interpolation circuits often require a significant amount of time to perform their function; consequently, the TDC needs a quiet interval before the next measurement.

===Ramp interpolator===

When counting is not feasible because the clock rate would be too high, analog methods can be used. Analog methods are often used to measure intervals that are between 10 and 200 ns. These methods often use a capacitor that is charged during the interval being measured. Initially, the capacitor is discharged to zero volts. When the start event occurs, the capacitor is charged with a constant current &quot;I&quot;1; the constant current causes the voltage &quot;v&quot; on the capacitor to increase linearly with time. The rising voltage is called the fast ramp. When the stop event occurs, the charging current is stopped. The voltage on the capacitor &quot;v&quot; is directly proportional to the time interval &quot;T&quot; and can be measured with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The resolution of such a system is in the range of 1 to 10 ps.

Although a separate ADC can be used, the ADC step is often integrated into the interpolator. A second constant current &quot;I&quot;2 is used to discharge the capacitor at a constant but much slower rate (the slow ramp). The slow ramp might be 1/1000 of the fast ramp. This discharge effectively &quot;stretches&quot; the time interval; it will take 1000 times as long for the capacitor to discharge to zero volts. The stretched interval can be measured with a counter. The measurement is similar to a dual-slope analog converter.

The dual-slope conversion can take a long time: a thousand or so clock ticks in the scheme described above. That limits how often a measurement can be made (dead time). Resolution of 1 ps with a 100 MHz (10 ns) clock requires a stretch ratio of 10,000 and implies a conversion time of 150 μs. To decrease the conversion time, the interpolator circuit can be used twice in a residual interpolator technique. The fast ramp is used initially as above to determine the time. The slow ramp is only at 1/100. The slow ramp will cross zero at some time during the clock period. When the ramp crosses zero, the fast ramp is turned on again to measure the crossing time (&quot;t&quot;residual). Consequently, the time can be determined to 1 part in 10,000.

Interpolators are often used with a stable system clock. The start event is asynchronous, but the stop event is a following clock. For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1 volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the start event occurs at 67.3 ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous start event is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to .327 V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327 V and the synchronizer reports the start event has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output can be used to capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7 ns before the synchronizer reported.

The interpolator is actually more involved because there are synchronizer issues and current switching is not instantaneous. Also, the interpolator must calibrate the height of the ramp to a clock period.

===Vernier===
====Vernier interpolator====
The vernier method is more involved. The method involves a triggerable oscillator and a coincidence circuit. At the event, the integer clock count is stored and the oscillator is started. The triggered oscillator has a slightly different frequency than the clock oscillator. For sake of argument, say the triggered oscillator has a period that is 1 ns faster than the clock. If the event happened 67 ns after the last clock, then the triggered oscillator transition will slide by −1 ns after each subsequent clock pulse. The triggered oscillator will be at 66 ns after the next clock, at 65 ns after the second clock, and so forth. A coincidence detector looks for when the triggered oscillator and the clock transition at the same time, and that indicates the fraction time that needs to be added.

The interpolator design is more involved. The triggerable clock must be calibrated to clock. It must also start quickly and cleanly.

====Vernier method====
The Vernier method is a digital version of the time stretching method. Two only slightly detuned oscillators (with frequencies formula_15 and formula_16) start their signals with the arrival of the start and the stop signal. As soon as the leading edges of the oscillator signals coincide the measurement ends and the number of periods of the oscillators (formula_6 and formula_7 respectively) lead to the original time interval formula_2:

:formula_20

Since highly reliable oscillators with stable and accurate frequency are still quite a challenge one also realizes the vernier method via two tapped delay lines using two slightly different cell delay times formula_21. This setting is called differential delay line or vernier delay line.

In the example presented here the first delay line affiliated with the start signal contains cells of D-flip-flops with delay formula_22 which are initially set to transparent. During the transition of the start signal through one of those cells, the signal is delayed by formula_22 and the state of the flip-flop is sampled as transparent. The second delay line belonging to the stop signal is composed of a series of non-inverting buffers with delay formula_24. Propagating through its channel the stop signal latches the flip-flops of the start signal&#x27;s delay line. As soon as the stop signal passes the start signal, the latter is stopped and all leftover flip-flops are sampled opaque. Analogous to the above case of the oscillators the wanted time interval formula_2 is then

:formula_26

with n the number of cells marked as transparent.

===Digital delay-line based TDC===
In general a digital delay-line based TDC, also known as tapped delay line, contains a chain of cells (e.g. using D-latches in the figure) with well defined delay times formula_21. The start signal propagates through this chain and is successively delayed by each cell. The number of cells that the start signal propagated through when the stop signal happens will be the (rounded) time interval between the start and stop signal divided by formula_21.

==Hybrid measurement==

Counters can measure long intervals but have limited resolution. Interpolators have high resolution but they cannot measure long intervals. A hybrid approach can achieve both long intervals and high resolution. The long interval can be measured with a counter. The counter information is supplemented with two time interpolators: one interpolator measures the (short) interval between the start event and a following clock event, and the second interpolator measure the interval between the stop event and a following clock event. The basic idea has some complications: the start and stop events are asynchronous, and one or both might happen close to a clock pulse. The counter and interpolators must agree on matching the start and end clock events. To accomplish that goal, synchronizers are used.

The common hybrid approach is the Nutt method. In this example the fine measurement circuit measures the time between start and stop pulse and the respective second nearest clock pulse of the coarse counter (&quot;T&quot;start, &quot;T&quot;stop), detected by the synchronizer (see figure). Thus the wanted time interval is

:formula_29

with &quot;n&quot; the number of counter clock pulses and &quot;T&quot;0 the period of the coarse counter.

==History==

Time measurement has played a crucial role in the understanding of nature from the earliest times. Starting with sun, sand or water driven clocks we are able to use clocks today, based on the most precise caesium resonators.

The first direct predecessor of a TDC was invented in the year 1942 by Bruno Rossi for the measurement of muon lifetimes. It was designed as a time-to-amplitude-converter, constantly charging a capacitor during the measured time interval. The corresponding voltage is directly proportional to the time interval under examination.

While the basic concepts (like Vernier methods (Pierre Vernier 1584-1638) and time stretching) of dividing time into measurable intervals are still up-to-date, the implementation changed a lot during the past 50 years. Starting with vacuum tubes and ferrite pot-core transformers those ideas are implemented in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) design today.

==Errors==
Regarding even the fine measuring methods presented, there are still errors one may wish remove or at least to consider. Non-linearities of the time-to-digital conversion for example can be identified by taking a large number of measurements of a poissonian distributed source (statistical code density test). Small deviations from the uniform distribution reveal the non-linearities.
Inconveniently the statistical code density method is quite sensitive to external temperature changes. Thus stabilizing delay or phase-locked loop (DLL or PLL) circuits are recommended.

In a similar way, offset errors (non-zero readouts at &quot;T&quot; = 0) can be removed.

For long time intervals, the error due to instabilities in the reference clock (jitter) plays a major role. Thus clocks of superior quality are needed for such TDCs.

Furthermore, external noise sources can be eliminated in postprocessing by robust estimation methods.

==Configurations==

TDCs are currently built as stand-alone measuring devices in physical experiments or as system components like PCI cards. They can be made up of either discrete or integrated circuits.

Circuit design changes with the purpose of the TDC, which can either be a very good solution for single-shot TDCs with long dead times or some trade-off between dead-time and resolution for multi-shot TDCs.

==Delay generator==

The time-to-digital converter measures the time between a start event and a stop event. There is also a digital-to-time converter or delay generator. The delay generator converts a number to a time delay. When the delay generator gets a start pulse at its input, then it outputs a stop pulse after the specified delay. The architectures for TDC and delay generators are similar. Both use counters for long, stable, delays. Both must consider the problem of clock quantization errors.

For example, the Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay uses a counter architecture. A digital delay may be set from 100 ns to 1 s in 100 ns increments. An analog circuit provides an additional fine delay of 0 to 100 ns. A 5 MHz reference clock drives a phase-locked loop to produce a stable 500 MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10 MHz and fed to main counter. The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500 MHz clock (2 ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2 ns of jitter. The recycle time is 575 ns.

Just as a TDC may use interpolation to get finer than one clock period resolution, a delay generator may use similar techniques. The Hewlett-Packard 5359A High Resolution Time Synthesizer provides delays of 0 to 160 ms, has an accuracy of 1 ns, and achieves a typical jitter of 100 ps. The design uses a triggered phase-locked oscillator that runs at 200 MHz. Interpolation is done with a ramp, an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter, and a comparator. The resolution is about 45 ps.
When the start pulse is received, then counts down and outputs a stop pulse. For low jitter the synchronous counter has to feed a zero flag from the most significant bit down to the least significant bit and then combine it with the output from the Johnson counter.

A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) could be used to achieve sub-cycle resolution, but it is easier to either use vernier Johnson counters or traveling-wave Johnson counters.

The delay generator can be used for pulse-width modulation, e.g. to drive a MOSFET to load a Pockels cell within 8 ns with a specific charge.

The output of a delay generator can gate a digital-to-analog converter and so pulses of a variable height can be generated. This allows matching to low levels needed by analog electronics, higher levels for ECL and even higher levels for TTL. If a series of DACs is gated in sequence, variable pulse shapes can be generated to account for any transfer function.

<doc id="715893" wikidata="Q6540738" url="?curid=715893" title="Liberal Party of Canada Rat Pack">
<text>The Rat Pack was the nickname given to a group of young, high-profile Canadian Liberal opposition Members of Parliament during the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

==Background==
In the 1984 federal election, the Liberal Party had suffered the worst defeat in its history to date. In the first years of the Mulroney government, which took over the 33rd Canadian Parliament, the Liberals failed to mount an effective opposition to Mulroney and were in danger of being overshadowed by the New Democratic Party (NDP), which had won almost as many seats as the Liberals.

In the midst of this, a group of young, energetic, and hitherto little-known Liberals soon emerged as a vocal voice of opposition to Mulroney. They included Don Boudria from eastern Ontario, Sheila Copps from Hamilton, Brian Tobin from Newfoundland, and John Nunziata from the Greater Toronto Area. Tobin had been elected when the Liberals under former prime minister Pierre Trudeau regained power from the Joe Clark-led Conservatives in the 1980 election; the others had retained constituencies that retiring Liberal MPs elected in 1980 had won, and were seen to be among the few bright spots for the Liberals in the 1984 blowout. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; attributed the name &quot;Rat Pack&quot; to &quot;a newspaper reporter&quot; who was unnamed. They played roles in ending the careers of several of Mulroney&#x27;s ministers due to their vocal criticism. The Rat Packers continued to serve as Official Opposition MPs after the PCs won the 1988 election and moved into supporting the government when the Liberals won in 1993.

Boudria, Tobin, and Copps were all appointed to Cabinet at various times during the subsequent ministry of Jean Chrétien.

Nunziata was expelled from the Liberal Party in 1996 for voting against the budget. He then ran—and won—as an independent candidate in the 1997 federal election and then lost to Liberal Alan Tonks in 2000. Tobin left Parliament in 1996 to become leader of the Newfoundland Liberal Party; he served as that province&#x27;s premier until returning to Parliament in 2000.

Under Paul Martin, who succeeded Chrétien in 2003, Copps and Boudria were relegated to the Liberal backbenches. Tobin had already left Parliament in 2002 in protest of the stranglehold on the Liberal organization by Martin&#x27;s supporters. In 2004, Copps&#x27; riding was merged with that of Martin loyalist Tony Valeri in such a way that most of the new riding&#x27;s residents lived in Valeri&#x27;s old riding. Copps was narrowly defeated for renomination. The last remaining member of the group, Boudria, had chosen to retire by the time of the 39th federal election in 2006.

<doc id="715895" wikidata="Q4127186" url="?curid=715895" title="Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency">
<text>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency is an uncommon form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) resulting from a mutation in the gene for one of the key enzymes in cortisol synthesis by the adrenal gland, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) type II (HSD3B2). As a result, higher levels of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone appear in the blood with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, which stimulates adrenal corticosteroid synthesis.

There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations of 3β-HSD CAH, from mild to severe forms. The uncommon severe form results from a complete loss of enzymatic activity and manifests itself in infancy as salt wasting due to the loss of mineralocorticoids. Milder forms resulting from incomplete loss of 3β-HSD type II function do not present with adrenal crisis, but can still produce virilization of genetically female infants and undervirilization of genetically male infants. As a result, this form of primary hypoadrenalism is the only form of CAH that can cause ambiguous genitalia in both genetic sexes.

==Signs and symptoms==
==Pathophysiology==
3β-HSD II mediates three parallel dehydrogenase/isomerase reactions in the adrenals that convert Δ4 to Δ5 steroids: pregnenolone to progesterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to androstenedione. 3β-HSD II also mediates an alternate route of testosterone synthesis from androstenediol in the testes. 3β-HSD deficiency results in large elevations of pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and DHEA. 

However, complexity arises from the presence of a second 3β-HSD isoform (HSD3B1) coded by a different gene, expressed in the liver and placenta, and unaffected in 3β-HSD-deficient CAH. The presence of this second enzyme has two clinical consequences. First, 3β-HSD II can convert enough of the excess 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to produce 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels suggestive of common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH. Measurement of the other affected steroids distinguishes the two. Second, 3β-HSD I can convert enough DHEA to testosterone to moderately virilize a genetically female fetus.

===Mineralocorticoids===
The mineralocorticoid aspect of severe 3β-HSD CAH is similar to those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Like other enzymes involved in early stages of both aldosterone and cortisol synthesis, the severe form of 3β-HSD deficiency can result in life-threatening salt-wasting in early infancy. Salt-wasting is managed acutely with saline and high-dose hydrocortisone, and long-term fludrocortisone.

===Sex steroid===
The sex steroid consequences of severe 3β-HSD CAH are unique among the congenital adrenal hyperplasias: it is the only form of CAH that can produce ambiguity in both sexes. As with 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH, the degree of severity can determine the magnitude of over- or undervirilization.

In an XX (genetically female) fetus, elevated amounts of DHEA can produce moderate virilization by conversion in the liver to testosterone. Virilization of genetic females is partial, often mild, and rarely raises assignment questions. The issues surrounding corrective surgery of the virilized female genitalia are the same as for moderate 21-hydroxylase deficiency but surgery is rarely considered desirable.

The extent to which mild 3β-HSD CAH can cause early appearance of pubic hair and other aspects of hyperandrogenism in later childhood or adolescence is unsettled. Early reports suggesting that mild forms of 3β-HSD CAH comprised significant proportions of girls with premature pubic hair or older women with hirsutism have not been confirmed and it now appears that premature pubarche in childhood and hirsutism after adolescence are not common manifestations of 3β-HSD CAH.

Undervirilization of genetic males with 3β-HSD CAH occurs because synthesis of testosterone is impaired in both adrenals and testes. Although DHEA is elevated, it is a weak androgen and too little testosterone is produced in the liver to offset the deficiency of testicular testosterone. The degree of undervirilization is more variable, from mild to severe. Management issues are those of an undervirilized male with normal sensitivity to testosterone.

If the infant boy is only mildly undervirilized, the hypospadias can be surgically repaired, testes brought into the scrotum, and testosterone supplied at puberty.

Management decisions are more difficult for a moderately or severely undervirilized genetic male whose testes are in the abdomen and whose genitalia look at least as much female as male. Male sex can be assigned and major reconstructive surgery done to close the midline of the perineum and move the testes into a constructed scrotum. Female sex can be assigned and the testes removed and vagina enlarged surgically. A recently advocated third choice would be to assign either sex and defer surgery to adolescence. Each approach carries its own disadvantages and risks.

==Diagnosis==
Like the other forms of CAH, suspicion of severe 3β-HSD CAH is usually raised by the appearance of the genitalia at birth or by development of a salt-wasting crisis in the first month of life. These severe, classical forms can be observed at birth by the following symptoms: boys may not develop masculine characteristics fully, while girls may have an enlarged clitoris. Both boys and girls may have problems with retaining salt (sodium) in their bodies. If the condition appears later in life (late onset, non-classical forms), there may be a short period of rapid growth. Still, ultimately, the individual may end up being shorter than expected because their bones mature faster. It is common for people with this condition to have difficulty getting pregnant or fathering children. In females, there may be signs of hyperandrogenism. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the distinctive pattern of adrenal steroids: elevated pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, DHEA, and renin. In clinical circumstances this form of CAH has sometimes been difficult to distinguish from the more common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH because of the 17α-hydroxypregnenolone elevation, or from simple premature adrenarche because of the DHEA elevation.

==Management==
Some of the childhood management issues are similar those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency:
* Replacing mineralocorticoid with fludrocortisone
* Suppressing DHEA and replacing cortisol with glucocorticoid
* Providing extra glucocorticoid for stress
* Close monitoring and perhaps other adjunctive measures to optimize growth
* Deciding whether surgical repair of virilized female genitalia is warranted

However, unlike 21-hydroxylase CAH, children with 3β-HSD CAH may be unable to produce adequate amounts of testosterone (boys) or estradiol (girls) to effect normal pubertal changes. Replacement testosterone or estrogen and progesterone can be initiated at adolescence and continued throughout adult life. Fertility may be impaired by the difficulty of providing appropriate sex hormone levels in the gonads even though the basic anatomy is present.

<doc id="715904" wikidata="Q842886" url="?curid=715904" title="Herrera Province">
<text>Herrera () is a province in Panama. Named after General Tomás Herrera, the province was founded on January 18, 1915 from a division of the Los Santos province. The capital city of Herrera is Chitré, which is located near the province&#x27;s coastline. Herrera is bordered on the north by the provinces of Veraguas and Coclé, on the south by the province of Los Santos, on the east by Golfo de Parita and the province of Los Santos, and on the west by the province of Veraguas.

==History==
After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, the isthmus of Panama was divided into two provinces, Panamá and Veraguas. The province Panamá consisted of the districts of Natá, Portobelo, Panama and Darién. At the time, the location now occupied by the city of Chitré was inhabited by a small population of indigenous persons, near La Villa de Los Santos and was governed from Natá. It later came under the control of the Los Santos government. The province of Herrera was created in 1854 and eliminated in 1860. 55 years later, in 1915 the province was created again by the president of Panama Dr. Belisario Porras.

Chitré was founded on October 19, 1848 by Ventura Solís, Matías Rodríguez, José Ríos, José María Benavidez, Ildelfonso Pérez, Blas Tello, Eugenio Barrera, José Burgos y Carlos Rodríguez. Chitré, however, was included in the province of Los Santos. It was not until 1915 under the Porras administration that Chitré became a part of Herrera and was made the province&#x27;s capital.

==Economy==
Of Panama&#x27;s nine provinces, Herrera ranks third in sugarcane production. Other commercial mainstays in Herrera include retail, equipment repair, banking, and domestic service. Prominent industries include dairy, cattle, commercial fishing, alcohol, ceramics, clay products, mosaics, and cement.

==Culture==
The famous Festival del Manito Ocueño has its origin in the city of Ocú in Herrera. Also, the pottery work in the province is extensive, consisting mainly of high-quality reproductions of pre-Columbian artifacts. Herrera&#x27;s pottery is the best-known in the country. Panama&#x27;s most famous alcoholic drink, &quot;seco&quot; &quot;(translation: dry)&quot;, is produced in Herrera, which is a sugarcane liqueur said to be drier than normal rum. Varela Hermanos, a company based in Pesé, sells seco under the trade name Seco Herrerano.

==Sports==
Herrera&#x27;s baseball team has won sixteen national championships, more than any other team in the country, including the 2005, 2006 and 2007 titles.

==Carnival==
The best-known carnivals are celebrated in Chitré, Parita and Ocú. Chitré&#x27;s carnival is one of the most popular in Panama, but those in Ocú have risen in prominence in recent years.

==Administrative divisions==
Herrera Province is divided into 7 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) and subdivided into 49 &quot;corregimientos&quot;.

<text>RenderWare is a video game engine developed by British game developer Criterion Software.

==Overview==
Released in 1993, RenderWare was a 3D API and graphics rendering engine used in video games, Active Worlds, and some VRML browsers. RenderWare was developed by Criterion Software Limited, then a subsidiary of Canon. It originated in the era of software rendering on CPUs prior to the appearance of GPUs, competing with other libraries such as Argonaut Games&#x27;s BRender and RenderMorphics&#x27; Reality Lab (the latter was acquired by Microsoft and became Direct3D). Renderware 4 was revealed at GDC 2004.

It was licensed over 200 times. The scope went towards an integrated middleware with low level APIs for rendering, physics, audio, AI all of which are extensible through plug-ins which also serve the official high-level API. The aim was to reduce the learning curve by also including service and support for licensees. With RenderWare Studio an integrated development environment including a debugger was included. RenderWare themselves claimed a 70% marketshare across studios that choose an external engine in 2003.

RenderWare&#x27;s principal commercial importance was in providing an off-the-shelf solution to the difficulties of PS2 graphics programming. As such, the engine was often described as &quot;Sony&#x27;s DirectX&quot; during this era which was a reference to its surrounding framework and toolchain middleware. Prior to version 2, an external programming or scripting language was required to take advantage of RenderWare. RenderWare 2, on the other hand, has its own internal scripting language, RWX (RenderWare script), but in RenderWare 3 RWX support was removed. This next iteration focused on a binary model file format. As with the previous version increment, Criterion removed support for RenderWare 3&#x27;s formats in RenderWare 4.

RenderWare is cross-platform: it runs on Windows as well as Apple Mac OS X-based applications and many video game consoles such as GameCube, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable. RenderWare is no longer available for purchase, although Electronic Arts still honors old contracts, meaning that external developers who licensed the technology before the Criterion acquisition may still use the software. What was RenderWare 4 has dissolved into the rest of EA internal tech. During a 2007 Gamasutra interview, Bing Gordon, EA CCO, has stated that RenderWare did not perform well enough for next-gen hardware, graphics wise, and that RenderWare did not stand up to competition, such as Unreal Engine from Epic Games. He has also stated that the RenderWare team is &quot;mostly a dev house&quot;.

<text>The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th or early 8th century BC. It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and is the earliest known alphabetic script to systematically write vowels as well as consonants. In Archaic and early Classical times, the Greek alphabet existed in many local variants, but, by the end of the 4th century BC, the Ionic-based Euclidean alphabet, with 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega, had become standard throughout the Greek-speaking world and is the version that is still used for Greek writing today.

The uppercase and lowercase forms of the 24 letters are:

The Greek alphabet is the ancestor of several scripts, such as the Latin, Gothic, Coptic, and Cyrillic scripts. Throughout antiquity, Greek had only a single uppercase form of each letter. It was written without diacritics and with little punctuation. By the 9th century, Byzantine scribes had begun to employ the lowercase form, which they derived from the cursive styles of the uppercase letters. Sound values and conventional transcriptions for some of the letters differ between Ancient and Modern Greek usage because the pronunciation of Greek has changed significantly between the 5th century BC and the present. Additionally, Modern and Ancient Greek now use different diacritics, with ancient Greek using the polytonic orthography and modern Greek keeping only the stress accent (acute) and the diaeresis.

Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of international technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science, and other fields.

== Letters ==
=== Sound values ===

In both Ancient and Modern Greek, the letters of the Greek alphabet have fairly stable and consistent symbol-to-sound mappings, making pronunciation of words largely predictable. Ancient Greek spelling was generally near-phonemic. For a number of letters, sound values differ considerably between Ancient and Modern Greek, because their pronunciation has followed a set of systematic phonological shifts that affected the language in its post-classical stages.
;Examples
;Notes
Among consonant letters, all letters that denoted voiced plosive consonants () and aspirated plosives () in Ancient Greek stand for corresponding fricative sounds in Modern Greek. The correspondences are as follows:
Among the vowel symbols, Modern Greek sound values reflect the radical simplification of the vowel system of post-classical Greek, merging multiple formerly distinct vowel phonemes into a much smaller number. This leads to several groups of vowel letters denoting identical sounds today. Modern Greek orthography remains true to the historical spellings in most of these cases. As a consequence, the spellings of words in Modern Greek are often not predictable from the pronunciation alone, while the reverse mapping, from spelling to pronunciation, is usually regular and predictable.

The following vowel letters and digraphs are involved in the mergers:
Modern Greek speakers typically use the same, modern symbol–sound mappings in reading Greek of all historical stages. In other countries, students of Ancient Greek may use a variety of conventional approximations of the historical sound system in pronouncing Ancient Greek.

=== Digraphs and letter combinations ===
Several letter combinations have special conventional sound values different from those of their single components. Among them are several digraphs of vowel letters that formerly represented diphthongs but are now monophthongized. In addition to the four mentioned above (, pronounced and , pronounced ), there is also , and , pronounced . The Ancient Greek diphthongs , and are pronounced , and in Modern Greek. In some environments, they are devoiced to , and . The Modern Greek consonant combinations and stand for and (or and ); stands for and stands for . In addition, both in Ancient and Modern Greek, the letter , before another velar consonant, stands for the velar nasal ; thus and are pronounced like English like in the word finger (not like in the word thing). In analogy to and , is also used to stand for before vowels , and , and before and . There are also the combinations and .

=== Diacritics ===
In the polytonic orthography traditionally used for ancient Greek and katharevousa, the stressed vowel of each word carries one of three accent marks: either the acute accent (), the grave accent (), or the circumflex accent ( or ). These signs were originally designed to mark different forms of the phonological pitch accent in Ancient Greek. By the time their use became conventional and obligatory in Greek writing, in late antiquity, pitch accent was evolving into a single stress accent, and thus the three signs have not corresponded to a phonological distinction in actual speech ever since. In addition to the accent marks, every word-initial vowel must carry either of two so-called &quot;breathing marks&quot;: the rough breathing (), marking an sound at the beginning of a word, or the smooth breathing (), marking its absence. The letter rho (ρ), although not a vowel, also carries rough breathing in a word-initial position. If a rho was geminated within a word, the first always had the smooth breathing and the second the rough breathing () leading to the transliteration .

The vowel letters carry an additional diacritic in certain words, the so-called iota subscript, which has the shape of a small vertical stroke or a miniature below the letter. This iota represents the former offglide of what were originally long diphthongs, (i.e. ), which became monophthongized during antiquity.

Another diacritic used in Greek is the diaeresis (), indicating a hiatus.

This system of diacritics was first developed by the scholar Aristophanes of Byzantium (), who worked at the Musaeum in Alexandria during the 3rd century BC. Aristophanes of Byzantium also was the first to divide poems into lines, rather than writing them like prose, and also introduced a series of signs for textual criticism. In 1982, a new, simplified orthography, known as &quot;monotonic&quot;, was adopted for official use in Modern Greek by the Greek state. It uses only a single accent mark, the acute (also known in this context as , i.e. simply &#x27;accent&#x27;), marking the stressed syllable of polysyllabic words, and occasionally the diaeresis to distinguish diphthongal from digraph readings in pairs of vowel letters, making this monotonic system very similar to the accent mark system used in Spanish. The polytonic system is still conventionally used for writing Ancient Greek, while in some book printing and generally in the usage of conservative writers it can still also be found in use for Modern Greek.

Although it is not a diacritic, the comma has a similar function as a silent letter in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing (, &#x27;whatever&#x27;) from (, &#x27;that&#x27;).

=== Romanization ===

There are many different methods of rendering Greek text or Greek names in the Latin script. The form in which classical Greek names are conventionally rendered in English goes back to the way Greek loanwords were incorporated into Latin in antiquity. In this system, is replaced with , the diphthongs and are rendered as and (or ); and and are simplified to and . Smooth breathing marks are usually ignored and rough breathing marks are usually rendered as the letter . In modern scholarly transliteration of Ancient Greek, will usually be rendered as , and the vowel combinations as . The letters and are generally rendered as and ; as either or ; and word-initial as .

Transcription conventions for Modern Greek differ widely, depending on their purpose, on how close they stay to the conventional letter correspondences of Ancient Greek-based transcription systems, and to what degree they attempt either an exact letter-by-letter transliteration or rather a phonetically based transcription. Standardized formal transcription systems have been defined by the International Organization for Standardization (as ISO 843), by the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, by the Library of Congress, and others.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
During the Mycenaean period, between roughly the 16th and 12th centuries BC, a script called Linear B was used to write the earliest attested form of the Greek language, known as Mycenaean Greek. This writing system, unrelated to the Greek alphabet, last appeared in the 13th century BC. Inscription written in the Greek alphabet begin to emerge from the 8th century BC onward. While early samples of the Greek alphabet date from at least 775 BC, the oldest known substantial and comprehensible Greek inscriptions, such as those on the Dipylon vase, the cup of Nestor and cup of Acesander, date from /30 BC. It is accepted that the introduction of the alphabet occurred some time prior to these inscriptions. While earlier dates have been proposed, the Greek alphabet is commonly held to have originated some time in the late 9th or early 8th century BC, conventionally around 800 BC.
The period between the use of the two writing systems, Linear B and the Greek alphabet, during which no Greek texts are attested, is known as the Greek Dark Ages. The Greeks adopted the alphabet from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, one of the closely related scripts used for the West Semitic languages, calling it &#x27;Phoenician letters&#x27;. However, the Phoenician alphabet was limited to consonants. When it was adopted for writing Greek, certain consonants were adapted in order to express vowels. The use of both vowels and consonants makes Greek the first alphabet in the narrow sense, as distinguished from the abjads used in Semitic languages, which have letters only for consonants.
Greek initially took over all of the 22 letters of Phoenician. Five were reassigned to denote vowel sounds: the glide consonants (&quot;yodh&quot;) and (&quot;waw&quot;) were used for [i] (Ι, &quot;iota&quot;) and [u] (Υ, &quot;upsilon&quot;); the glottal stop consonant (&quot;aleph&quot;) was used for [a] (Α, &quot;alpha&quot;); the pharyngeal (&quot;ʿayin&quot;) was turned into [o] (Ο, &quot;omicron&quot;); and the letter for (&quot;he&quot;) was turned into [e] (Ε, &quot;epsilon&quot;). A doublet of &quot;waw&quot; was also borrowed as a consonant for [w] (Ϝ, &quot;digamma&quot;). In addition, the Phoenician letter for the emphatic glottal (&quot;heth&quot;) was borrowed in two different functions by different dialects of Greek: as a letter for /h/ (Η, &quot;heta&quot;) by those dialects that had such a sound, and as an additional vowel letter for the long (Η, &quot;eta&quot;) by those dialects that lacked the consonant. Eventually, a seventh vowel letter for the long (Ω, &quot;omega&quot;) was introduced. Greek also introduced three new consonant letters for its aspirated plosive sounds and consonant clusters: Φ (&quot;phi&quot;) for , Χ (&quot;chi&quot;) for and Ψ (&quot;psi&quot;) for . In western Greek variants, Χ was instead used for and Ψ for . The origin of these letters is a matter of some debate.



Three of the original Phoenician letters dropped out of use before the alphabet took its classical shape: the letter Ϻ (&quot;san&quot;), which had been in competition with Σ (&quot;sigma&quot;) denoting the same phoneme /s/; the letter Ϙ (&quot;qoppa&quot;), which was redundant with Κ (&quot;kappa&quot;) for /k/, and Ϝ (&quot;digamma&quot;), whose sound value /w/ dropped out of the spoken language before or during the classical period.

Greek was originally written predominantly from right to left, just like Phoenician, but scribes could freely alternate between directions. For a time, a writing style with alternating right-to-left and left-to-right lines (called &quot;boustrophedon&quot;, literally &#x27;ox-turning&#x27;, after the manner of an ox ploughing a field) was common, until in the classical period the left-to-right writing direction became the norm. Individual letter shapes were mirrored depending on the writing direction of the current line.

=== Archaic variants ===
There were initially numerous local (epichoric) variants of the Greek alphabet, which differed in the use and non-use of the additional vowel and consonant symbols and several other features. Epichoric alphabets are commonly divided into four major types according to their different treatments of additional consonant letters for the aspirated consonants (/pʰ, kʰ/) and consonant clusters (/ks, ps/) of Greek. These four types are often conventionally labelled as &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;light blue&quot; and &quot;dark blue&quot; types, based on a colour-coded map in a seminal 19th-century work on the topic, by Adolf Kirchhoff (1867).

The &quot;green&quot; (or southern) type is the most archaic and closest to the Phoenician. The &quot;red&quot; (or western) type is the one that was later transmitted to the West and became the ancestor of the Latin alphabet, and bears some crucial features characteristic of that later development. The &quot;blue&quot; (or eastern) type is the one from which the later standard Greek alphabet emerged. Athens used a local form of the &quot;light blue&quot; alphabet type until the end of the 5th century BC, which lacked the letters Ξ and Ψ as well as the vowel symbols Η and Ω. In the Old Attic alphabet, stood for and for . was used for all three sounds (correspondinɡ to classical ), and was used for all of (corresponding to classical ). The letter (heta) was used for the consonant . Some variant local letter forms were also characteristic of Athenian writing, some of which were shared with the neighboring (but otherwise &quot;red&quot;) alphabet of Euboia: a form of that resembled a Latin &quot;L&quot; () and a form of that resembled a Latin &quot;S&quot; ().

*Upsilon is also derived from waw ().

The classical twenty-four-letter alphabet that is now used to represent the Greek language was originally the local alphabet of Ionia. By the late 5th century BC, it was commonly used by many Athenians. In 403 BC, at the suggestion of the archon Eucleides, the Athenian Assembly formally abandoned the Old Attic alphabet and adopted the Ionian alphabet as part of the democratic reforms after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants. Because of Eucleides&#x27;s role in suggesting the idea to adopt the Ionian alphabet, the standard twenty-four-letter Greek alphabet is sometimes known as the &quot;Eucleidean alphabet&quot;. Roughly thirty years later, the Eucleidean alphabet was adopted in Boeotia and it may have been adopted a few years previously in Macedonia. By the end of the 4th century  BC, it had displaced local alphabets across the Greek-speaking world to become the standard form of the Greek alphabet.

=== Letter names ===
When the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they took over not only the letter shapes and sound values but also the names by which the sequence of the alphabet could be recited and memorized. In Phoenician, each letter name was a word that began with the sound represented by that letter; thus &quot;ʾaleph&quot;, the word for &quot;ox&quot;, was used as the name for the glottal stop , &quot;bet&quot;, or &quot;house&quot;, for the sound, and so on. When the letters were adopted by the Greeks, most of the Phoenician names were maintained or modified slightly to fit Greek phonology; thus, &quot;ʾaleph, bet, gimel&quot; became &quot;alpha, beta, gamma&quot;.

The Greek names of the following letters are more or less straightforward continuations of their Phoenician antecedents. Between Ancient and Modern Greek, they have remained largely unchanged, except that their pronunciation has followed regular sound changes along with other words (for instance, in the name of &quot;beta&quot;, ancient /b/ regularly changed to modern /v/, and ancient /ɛː/ to modern /i/, resulting in the modern pronunciation &quot;vita&quot;). The name of lambda is attested in early sources as besides ; in Modern Greek the spelling is often , reflecting pronunciation. Similarly, iota is sometimes spelled in Modern Greek ( is conventionally transcribed word-initially and intervocalically before back vowels and ). In the tables below, the Greek names of all letters are given in their traditional polytonic spelling; in modern practice, like with all other words, they are usually spelled in the simplified monotonic system.


In the cases of the three historical sibilant letters below, the correspondence between Phoenician and Ancient Greek is less clear, with apparent mismatches both in letter names and sound values. The early history of these letters (and the fourth sibilant letter, obsolete san) has been a matter of some debate. Here too, the changes in the pronunciation of the letter names between Ancient and Modern Greek are regular.

In the following group of consonant letters, the older forms of the names in Ancient Greek were spelled with , indicating an original pronunciation with &quot;-ē&quot;. In Modern Greek these names are spelled with .

The following group of vowel letters were originally called simply by their sound values as long vowels: ē, ō, ū, and . Their modern names contain adjectival qualifiers that were added during the Byzantine period, to distinguish between letters that had become confusable. Thus, the letters and , pronounced identically by this time, were called &quot;o mikron&quot; (&quot;small o&quot;) and &quot;o mega&quot; (&quot;big o&quot;). The letter was called &quot;e psilon&quot; (&quot;plain e&quot;) to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph , while, similarly, , which at this time was pronounced , was called &quot;y psilon&quot; (&quot;plain y&quot;) to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph .

Some dialects of the Aegean and Cypriot have retained long consonants and pronounce and ; also, has come to be pronounced in Cypriot.

=== Letter shapes ===
Like Latin and other alphabetic scripts, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter, without a distinction between uppercase and lowercase. This distinction is an innovation of the modern era, drawing on different lines of development of the letter shapes in earlier handwriting.

The oldest forms of the letters in antiquity are majuscule forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, as well as many connecting lines and ligatures between letters.

In the 9th and 10th centuries, uncial book hands were replaced with a new, more compact writing style, with letter forms partly adapted from the earlier cursive. This minuscule style remained the dominant form of handwritten Greek into the modern era. During the Renaissance, western printers adopted the minuscule letter forms as lowercase printed typefaces, while modeling uppercase letters on the ancient inscriptional forms. The orthographic practice of using the letter case distinction for marking proper names, titles, etc. developed in parallel to the practice in Latin and other western languages.

== Derived alphabets ==

The Greek alphabet was the model for various others:
* Most of the Iron Age alphabets of Asia Minor were adopted around the same time, as the early Greek alphabet was adopted from the Phoenician. The Lydian and Carian alphabets are generally believed to derive from the Greek alphabet, although it is not clear which variant is the direct ancestor. While some of these alphabets such as Phrygian had slight differences from the Greek counterpart, some like Carian alphabet had mostly different values and several other characters inherited from pre-Greek local scripts. They were in use –300 BC until all the Anatolian languages were extinct due to Hellenization.
* The Latin alphabet, together with various other ancient scripts in Italy, adopted from an archaic form of the Greek alphabet brought to Italy by Greek colonists in the late 8th century BC, via Etruscan;
* The Gothic alphabet, devised in the 4th century to write the Gothic language, based on a combination of Greek and Latin uncial models;
* The Glagolitic alphabet, devised in the 9th century for writing Old Church Slavonic;
* The Cyrillic script, which replaced the Glagolitic alphabet shortly afterwards.
* The Coptic alphabet adds eight letters derived from Demotic. It is still used today, mostly in Egypt, to write Coptic, the liturgical language of Egyptian Christians. Letters usually retain an uncial form different from the forms used for Greek today. The alphabet of Old Nubian is an adaptation of Coptic.

The Armenian and Georgian alphabets are almost certainly modeled on the Greek alphabet, but their graphic forms are quite different.

== Other uses ==

=== Use for other languages ===
Apart from the daughter alphabets listed above, which were adapted from Greek but developed into separate writing systems, the Greek alphabet has also been adopted at various times and in various places to write other languages. For some of them, additional letters were introduced.

==== Antiquity ====

* It was used in some Paleo-Balkan languages, including Thracian. For other neighboring languages or dialects, such as Ancient Macedonian, isolated words are preserved in Greek texts, but no continuous texts are preserved.
* Gaulish inscriptions (in modern France) used the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest
* The Bactrian language, an Iranian language spoken in what is now Afghanistan, was written in the Greek alphabet during the Kushan Empire (65–250 AD). It adds an extra letter for the &quot;sh&quot; sound .
* Derived from Indo-Greek coinage, the coins of Nahapana and Chastana of the Western Satraps featured an Indo-Aryan language legend written in Greek or pseudo-Greek letters. The subsequent rulers&#x27; coins had the Greek script degrade to a mere ornament that no longer represented any legible legend.

==== Middle Ages ====
* Coins from the 4th-8th centuries known as mordovkas were used as currency in Eastern Europe by Uralic peoples and were written in Moksha using Greek uncial script.
* An 8th-century Arabic fragment preserves a text in the Greek alphabet, as does a 9th- or 10th-century psalm translation fragment.
* An Old Ossetic inscription of the 10th–12th centuries found in Arxyz, the oldest known attestation of an Ossetic language.
* The Old Nubian language of Makuria (modern Sudan) adds three Coptic letters, two letters derived from Meroitic script, and a digraph of two Greek gammas used for the velar nasal sound.
* Various South Slavic dialects, similar to the modern Bulgarian and Macedonian languages, have been written in Greek script. The modern South Slavic languages now use modified Cyrillic alphabets.

==== Early modern ====

* Turkish spoken by Orthodox Christians (&quot;Karamanlides&quot;) was often written in Greek script, and called &quot;Karamanlidika&quot;.
* Tosk Albanian was often written using the Greek alphabet, starting in about 1500. The printing press at Moschopolis published several Albanian texts in Greek script during the 18th century. It was only in 1908 that the Monastir conference standardized a Latin orthography for both Tosk and Gheg. Greek spelling is still occasionally used for the local Albanian dialects (Arvanitika) in Greece.
* Gagauz, a Turkic language of the northeast Balkans spoken by Orthodox Christians, was apparently written in Greek characters in the late 19th century. In 1957, it was standardized on Cyrillic, and in 1996, a Gagauz alphabet based on Latin characters was adopted (derived from the Turkish alphabet).
* Surguch, a Turkic language, was spoken by a small group of Orthodox Christians in northern Greece. It is now written in Latin or Cyrillic characters.
* Urum or Greek Tatar, spoken by Orthodox Christians, used the Greek alphabet.
* Judaeo-Spanish or Ladino, a Jewish dialect of Spanish, has occasionally been published in Greek characters in Greece.
* The Italian humanist Giovan Giorgio Trissino tried to add some Greek letters (Ɛ ε, Ꞷ ω) to Italian orthography in 1524.

=== In mathematics and science ===

Greek symbols are used as symbols in mathematics, physics and other sciences. Many symbols have traditional uses, such as lower case epsilon (ε) for an arbitrarily small positive number, lower case pi (π) for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, capital sigma (Σ) for summation, and lower case sigma (σ) for standard deviation. For many years the Greek alphabet was used by the World Meteorological Organization for naming North Atlantic hurricanes if a season was so active that it exhausted the regular list of storm names. This happened during the 2005 season (when Alpha through Zeta were used), and the 2020 season (when Alpha through Iota were used), after which the practice was discontinued. In May 2021 the World Health Organization announced that the variants of SARS-CoV-2 of the virus would be named using letters of the Greek alphabet to avoid stigma and simplify communications for non-scientific audiences.

=== Astronomy ===

Greek letters are used to denote the brighter stars within each of the eighty-eight constellations. In most constellations, the brightest star is designated Alpha and the next brightest Beta etc. For example, the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus is known as Alpha Centauri. For historical reasons, the Greek designations of some constellations begin with a lower ranked letter.

=== International Phonetic Alphabet ===
Several Greek letters are used as phonetic symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Several of them denote fricative consonants; the rest stand for variants of vowel sounds. The glyph shapes used for these letters in specialized phonetic fonts is sometimes slightly different from the conventional shapes in Greek typography proper, with glyphs typically being more upright and using serifs, to make them conform more with the typographical character of other, Latin-based letters in the phonetic alphabet. Nevertheless, in the Unicode encoding standard, the following three phonetic symbols are considered the same characters as the corresponding Greek letters proper:

On the other hand, the following phonetic letters have Unicode representations separate from their Greek alphabetic use, either because their conventional typographic shape is too different from the original, or because they also have secondary uses as regular alphabetic characters in some Latin-based alphabets, including separate Latin uppercase letters distinct from the Greek ones.

The symbol in Americanist phonetic notation for the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative is the Greek letter lambda , but in the IPA. The IPA symbol for the palatal lateral approximant is , which looks similar to lambda, but is actually an inverted lowercase &quot;y&quot;.

=== Use as numerals ===

Greek letters were also used to write numbers. In the classical Ionian system, the first nine letters of the alphabet stood for the numbers from 1 to 9, the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 10, from 10 to 90, and the next nine letters stood for the multiples of 100, from 100 to 900. For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters which by that time made up the standard alphabet, three otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived: digamma for 6, koppa for 90, and a rare Ionian letter for [ss], today called sampi , for 900. This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English. The three extra symbols are today written as , and . To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called &quot;keraia&quot; is added to the right of it.



=== Use by student fraternities and sororities ===
In North America, many college fraternities and sororities are named with combinations of Greek letters, and are hence also known as &quot;Greek letter organizations&quot;. This naming tradition was initiated by the foundation of the Phi Beta Kappa society at the College of William and Mary in 1776. The name of this fraternal organization is an acronym for the ancient Greek phrase (), which means &quot;Love of wisdom, the guide of life&quot; and serves as the organization&#x27;s motto. Sometimes early fraternal organizations were known by their Greek letter names because the mottos that these names stood for were secret and revealed only to members of the fraternity.

Different chapters within the same fraternity are almost always (with a handful of exceptions) designated using Greek letters as serial numbers. The founding chapter of each organization is its A chapter. As an organization expands, it establishes a B chapter, a Γ chapter, and so on and so forth. In an organization that expands to more than 24 chapters, the chapter after Ω chapter is AA chapter, followed by AB chapter, etc. Each of these is still a &quot;chapter Letter&quot;, albeit a double-digit letter just as 10 through 99 are double-digit numbers. The Roman alphabet has a similar extended form with such double-digit letters when necessary, but it is used for columns in a table or chart rather than chapters of an organization.

== Glyph variants ==
Some letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting. While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.
* The symbol (&quot;curled beta&quot;) is a cursive variant form of beta (β). In the French tradition of Ancient Greek typography, β is used word-initially, and is used word-internally.
* The letter delta has a form resembling a cursive capital letter D; while not encoded as its own form, this form is included as part of the symbol for the drachma (a Δρ digraph) in the Currency Symbols block, at U+20AF (₯).
* The letter epsilon can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants, either shaped formula_1 (&#x27;lunate epsilon&#x27;, like a semicircle with a stroke) or formula_2 (similar to a reversed number 3). The symbol ϵ (U+03F5) is designated specifically for the lunate form, used as a technical symbol.
* The symbol (&quot;script theta&quot;) is a cursive form of theta (θ), frequent in handwriting, and used with a specialized meaning as a technical symbol.
* The symbol (&quot;kappa symbol&quot;) is a cursive form of kappa (κ), used as a technical symbol.
* The symbol formula_3 (&quot;variant pi&quot;) is an archaic script form of pi (π), also used as a technical symbol.
* The letter rho (ρ) can occur in different stylistic variants, with the descending tail either going straight down or curled to the right. The symbol (U+03F1) is designated specifically for the curled form, used as a technical symbol.
* The letter sigma, in standard orthography, has two variants: ς, used only at the ends of words, and σ, used elsewhere. The form (&quot;lunate sigma&quot;, resembling a Latin &quot;c&quot;) is a medieval stylistic variant that can be used in both environments without the final/non-final distinction.
* The capital letter upsilon (Υ) can occur in different stylistic variants, with the upper strokes either straight like a Latin &quot;Y&quot;, or slightly curled. The symbol ϒ (U+03D2) is designated specifically for the curled form (formula_4), used as a technical symbol, e.g. in physics.
* The letter phi can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants, either shaped as formula_5 (a circle with a vertical stroke through it) or as formula_6 (a curled shape open at the top). The symbol (U+03D5) is designated specifically for the closed form, used as a technical symbol.
* The letter omega has at least three stylistic variants of its capital form. The standard is the &quot;open omega&quot; (Ω), resembling an open partial circle with the opening downward and the ends curled outward. The two other stylistic variants are seen more often in modern typography, resembling a raised and underscored circle (roughly o̲), where the underscore may or may not be touching the circle on a tangent (in the former case it resembles a superscript omicron similar to that found in the numero sign or masculine ordinal indicator; in the latter, it closely resembles some forms of the Latin letter Q). The open omega is always used in symbolic settings and is encoded in Letterlike Symbols (U+2126) as a separate code point for backward compatibility.

== Computer encodings ==
For computer usage, a variety of encodings have been used for Greek online, many of them documented in .

The two principal ones still used today are ISO/IEC 8859-7 and Unicode. ISO 8859-7 supports only the monotonic orthography; Unicode supports both the monotonic and polytonic orthographies.

=== ISO/IEC 8859-7 ===
For the range A0–FF (hex), it follows the Unicode range 370–3CF (see below) except that some symbols, like ©, ½, § etc. are used where Unicode has unused locations. Like all ISO-8859 encodings, it is equal to ASCII for 00–7F (hex).

=== Greek in Unicode ===
Unicode supports polytonic orthography well enough for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy. With the use of combining characters, Unicode also supports Greek philology and dialectology and various other specialized requirements. Most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be &quot;represented&quot; as U+03B1 U+0304 U+0301, this rarely renders well: .

There are two main blocks of Greek characters in Unicode. The first is &quot;Greek and Coptic&quot; (U+0370 to U+03FF). This block is based on ISO 8859-7 and is sufficient to write Modern Greek. There are also some archaic letters and Greek-based technical symbols.

This block also supports the Coptic alphabet. Formerly, most Coptic letters shared codepoints with similar-looking Greek letters; but in many scholarly works, both scripts occur, with quite different letter shapes, so as of Unicode 4.1, Coptic and Greek were disunified. Those Coptic letters with no Greek equivalents still remain in this block (U+03E2 to U+03EF).

To write polytonic Greek, one may use combining diacritical marks or the precomposed characters in the &quot;Greek Extended&quot; block (U+1F00 to U+1FFF).

=== Encodings with a subset of the Greek alphabet ===
IBM code pages 437, 860, 861, 862, 863, and 865 contain the letters ΓΘΣΦΩαδεπστφ (plus β as an alternative interpretation for ß).

<text>The 2004 United Kingdom local elections were held on Thursday 10 June 2004, along with the European elections and the London mayoral and Assembly elections.

The councils of all the metropolitan boroughs in England and all the principal areas of Wales were all up for re-election, along with many other district and unitary authorities throughout England. No local elections were held in Scotland.

==Overall==
These were the first elections since Michael Howard became leader of the Conservative Party. Howard was looking for a good result in the election to confirm that the Conservatives were back on the road to being able to seriously consider winning the next general election.

Early results confirmed that the Labour Party was having a bad time. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said that, &quot;Iraq was a cloud, or indeed a shadow, over these elections. I am not saying we haven&#x27;t had a kicking. It&#x27;s not a great day for Labour&quot;.

However the Conservatives were not making many of the gains that would have indicated a complete change of electoral fortune. The national equivalent share of the vote in the election was found by academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher to be 37% to the Conservatives, 27% to the Liberal Democrats and 26% to Labour. For one of the two major parties to come third in local elections was unheard of in the post-1945 period, let alone for a governing party with such a large majority to come third.

Even in the North, Labour&#x27;s traditional heartland, Labour did not do too well, losing control of Doncaster, Leeds, Newcastle and St Helens. However, they did pick up several councils, notably Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff from Plaid Cymru in Wales.

Despite an increase in their vote and number of councillors, the Liberal Democrats saw a net loss of councils to NOC. The loss to the Conservatives of Eastbourne was in a single-seat by-election. This was partially offset by victories in Newcastle upon Tyne and Pendle.

The British National Party made a net gain of four seats, and held 14. This left them with a total 21 councillors in the country, including six in Burnley and four in Bradford. In the wards they contested, they averaged 16.1% of the vote.

It was to prove a false dawn for the Conservatives; when Britain went to the polls for the following year&#x27;s general election, Labour was re-elected, although its majority was greatly reduced and the Conservatives did make gains.

<text>Kaohsiung County was a county in southern Taiwan between 1945 and 2010. The county seat was located in Fongshan City.

==History==
Kaohsiung County was established on 6 December 1945 on the territory of Takao Prefecture () shortly after the end of World War II. In the early years, Kaohsiung County consists of most territory of Takao Prefecture except the territory near cities of Takao (Kaohsiung) and Heitō (Pingtung). The county is divided into districts (), which come from reformed Japanese districts (). The districts are divided into townships.

On 16 August 1950, another division reform was implemented. The southern part of the county was separated and established Pingtung County. The remaining Kaohsiung County has territory equivalent to the Hōzan (Fengshan), Okayama (Kangshan), and Kizan (Chishan) in the Japanese era. In addition, districts in the remaining part of Kaohsiung County was defunct. All townships were directly controlled by the County Government. On 25 December 2010, the county merged with Kaohsiung City to form a larger single special municipality.

== Administration ==
The subdivisions of the County remains mostly stable between 1950 and 2010. However, some changed has also been made.
* 1 July 1957, Maya Township () was renamed Sanmin Township (), Yani Township () was renamed Taoyuan Township (), Tona Township () was renamed Maolin Township ().
* 1 July 1972, Fengshan () reformed from an urban township to a county-administered city for its population.
* 1 July 1979, Hsiaokang () merged into Kaohsiung City and reformed from a rural township to a district.
* 1 January 2008, Sanmin Township was renamed Namasia Township ().
On 25 December 2010, the county was merged with Kaohsiung City, all cities and townships became districts. On the eve of merging with Kaohsiung City, the county consists of the following administrative divisions

<doc id="715920" wikidata="Q5471479" url="?curid=715920" title="Fort Lauderdale Sun">
<text>Fort Lauderdale/South Florida Sun was a professional U.S. soccer team which played two seasons in the United Soccer League. 

==Origins==
In November of 1983, The Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League, motivated in part by the lack of a suitable arena in the Fort Lauderdale area for the league&#x27;s winter indoor season, announced that they would be moving to Minnesota. The outdoor version of the Strikers had attracted a relatively robust fan base in the late 1970s and early 80s, and former Miami Toros and Strikers player Ronnie Sharp headed up a group that believed that the city was still a good market for the game. They were granted a franchise by the second division American Soccer League&#x27;s expansion committee to join them in 1984. Despite the ASL being down to only four active teams at the time, these franchise rights were challenged at the league meetings in January of 1984 because league by-laws allowed the owner of a dormant franchise in Miami to retain territorial control over south Florida. This dispute would be the catalyst for a seismic change in the second tier of pro soccer, as the owners of the ASL&#x27;s Jacksonville Tea Men and Dallas Americans would see it as confirmation that the ASL was too hampered by its cadre of inactive owners and not financially sound enough to have much of a future. They broke away to form what they hoped would be a better-organized and more stable league to be called the United Soccer League. The USL offered Sharp&#x27;s group a place, and the rest of the teams who had been planning to play in the ASL in 1984 either also defected to the new league or folded over the next few months. The new Fort Lauderdale club chose the name Sun, and they joined the Tea Men and Charlotte Gold in the Southern Division of the nine team USL. 

==1984: Champions==
When the Sun built its team for the 1984 season, they were able to secure the services of several former Strikers who had chosen not to go north with the NASL club. Teófilo Cubillas, Jim Tietjens, Ernst-Jean Baptiste, and player-coach Keith Weller all signed with the Sun (though Cubillas would only commit to playing home games), and they were joined by former English international Dave Watson and Scottish international Asa Hartford, giving the Sun one of the most talented rosters in the league. This paid dividends, as they played to a 15–9 record, scoring fifty-three goals and giving up only thirty-four. The Sun finished at the top of the Southern Division and just a few standings points behind the Oklahoma City Stampede for the top seed in the playoffs. They would achieve this on-field success despite primary owner Ronnie Sharp&#x27;s arrest less than a month into the season for alleged participation in a large drug smuggling operation. 

In the playoff semifinals, the Sun crushed the Buffalo Storm by scores of 3-0 and 5-1. The championship round against the Houston Dynamos would be much more closely contested. Houston won the first game at home in a shootout. The Sun won Game 2 by a score of 3-0, setting up a decisive Game 3 on September 1st. This game also ended tied after regulation and overtime, but the Sun would win the shootout round this time to clinch the first USL championship. During the series, the troubled Ronnie Sharp announced that he had sold the team to a group composed mainly of doctors who had sat together at Strikers games.

==1985: League Cup and league collapse==
Though the USL tried to help teams operate within their means through strict salary caps and schedules that heavily featured regional play to reduce travel expenses, virtually all of its teams were losing money during their first season. Several teams failed to post a performance bond to guarantee their return for 1985. The first division NASL was also in deep trouble, with only a few of its remaining nine teams willing to commit to another outdoor season. A last-ditch idea to merge the USL and NASL to salvage some form of professional outdoor soccer that summer was discussed, but USL commissioner William Burfeind announced that this merger would not go through on March 5th. Within a few weeks the NASL had cancelled its upcoming season and five USL teams (including the Sun&#x27;s division rivals in Charlotte and Jacksonville) had officially folded, while another had withdrawn to become an independent club.

The renamed South Florida Sun were joined by only the Dallas Americans, Tulsa Tornado&#x27;s (who had moved from Oklahoma City and re-branded), and an expansion team in El Paso/Juarez for the USL&#x27;s 1985 season. To buy time to attract a few more members, the USL decided to re-arrange the schedule by splitting the season into two parts. In the first part of the season, the four teams would compete for the &quot;USL Cup&quot; in a round-robin style tournament. A 12-game regular season was to begin in late June. USL Cup play got underway on May 19th, but the league&#x27;s future looked bleak. Commissioner William Burfeind resigned just as the games were starting. The teams in Tulsa and Dallas were both having trouble making payroll, and unpaid players in Tulsa refused to participate in one exhibition and one USL Cup game. The Sun was soon facing payroll issues of their own, but the team still managed to finish at the top of USL Cup table with a 4-2 record. As was befitting a league that had been on life support since before its first game of the season, the acting commissioner was not present when the Sun clinched the cup nor was an actual USL Cup trophy presented to them, causing Sun player-coach, Keith Weller, to proclaim &quot;There ain&#x27;t no cup.&quot; Despite the fact that the team and the league were barely hanging on, the front office attempted to proceed as though it was business as usual, even managing to sign former New York Cosmos and Dutch national team star Johan Neeskens to a three-year contract in mid-June. On June 22nd, with no new teams having joined the league, the Sun began regular season play at home against Dallas. The 3-1 victory would turn out to be the final USL game and the only league game in which Neeskens would suit up for South Florida (despite the &quot;three-year contract,&quot; he would never receive an official paycheck). Before the Sun&#x27;s next scheduled match, creditors foreclosed on the league and locked officials out of their offices. The USL voted to suspend play on June 25th. 

Following the league’s collapse, the Sun were the only USL club that did not immediately fold. Desperate to keep professional soccer alive in the area, the ownership group scrambled to find new financial backing while the coaches worked to schedule exhibition matches that they hoped would earn enough money to make up the back pay owed to the team and sustain them through the summer. A cancelled July 2nd exhibition against the U.S. National Team was replaced with a game against the Topez-Haitian All-Stars of Miami on July 4th, and plans were made to host the Minnesota Strikers two days later. However, the Sun was unable to raise the money needed to pay for the Strikers&#x27; travel and lodging, and the game against the Topez-Haitian All-Stars, which served as a warm-up act for the town&#x27;s Independence Day fireworks, would be the only game that the team would participate in as an independent club. The Sun rallied to win 4–3 before a crowd of 3,529. The morning after the game, the Sun players, who had not received their full paychecks since May 31st, voted on how to equitably distribute the net proceeds from the gate amongst the players and remaining staff. Team owners soon came to grips with the fact that the organization simply did not have the means to carry on. They officially announced the suspension of operations a few days later, and the players began to disperse back into everyday life.

===Florida Derby===
On June 27, 1984 the Sun made their only appearance in the Florida Derby, falling to the Tampa Bay Rowdies, 5–1, in an inter-league friendly. Two more derby matches were planned for in 1985, but the Sun closed up shop before those games could materialize.

<text>Cider apples are a group of apple cultivars grown for their use in the production of cider (referred to as &quot;hard cider&quot; in the United States). Cider apples are distinguished from &quot;cookers&quot; and &quot;eaters&quot;, or dessert apples, by their bitterness or dryness of flavour, qualities which make the fruit unpalatable but can be useful in cidermaking. Some apples are considered to occupy more than one category.

In the United Kingdom, the Long Ashton Research Station categorised cider apples in 1903 into four main types according to the proportion of tannins and malic acid in the fruit. For cider production, it is important that the fruit contains high sugar levels which encourage fermentation and raise the final alcohol levels. Cider apples therefore often have higher sugar levels than dessert and cooking apples. It is also considered important for cider apples to contribute tannins, which add depth to the finished cider&#x27;s flavour.

==Classification of cider apples==
===Long Ashton Research Station classification system===
In 1903, Professor B.T.P. Barker, the first director of the Long Ashton Research Station (LARS) in Bristol, England, established an analytical classification system for cider apples based on tannin and malic acid percentages in pressed juice. This system is divided into four categories, which are as follows:

Long Ashton&#x27;s classification system also included a three-level classification of tannin: &quot;full&quot; for an apple with pronounced tannins (e.g. a &quot;full bittersweet&quot; such as Chisel Jersey, &quot;mild&quot; for light tannins such as Cummy Norman, and &quot;medium&quot; such as Dabinett.

Tannins are further sometimes categorised as &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;soft&quot;, for bitter and astringent tannins respectively.

British cidermakers normally blend juice from apples of multiple categories to ensure a finished cider with a balanced flavour and for the best and most consistent quality. While traditional ciders were made from whatever apples were available locally, the blend of sugar, acid and tannin required for a successful cider is difficult to achieve from any single cultivar with the possible exception of some bittersharps. As bittersharps are rare, a common modern approach is to use a range of bittersweet varieties with some sharps, or a cooking apple such as the readily available Bramley, to balance the acidity. Sharps, with their high acid content, also keep the cider&#x27;s pH below 3.8 to prevent spoilage; sweets help provide adequate sugar for fermentation to the proper alcohol content.

===French and Spanish classification systems===
In addition to the Long Ashton Research Station classification, Charles Neal has written about a French classification system. In France and Spain, the system has an intermediate category called &quot;acidulée&quot; or &quot;acidulada&quot; respectively, which is sometimes used to classify cider apples that are semi-tart and have low tannin content. Similar to the English system, acidity and tannins are considered. Apples are classified as follows:

In the US, there are four regions where cider apples are grown in orchards: the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Northwest. Out of the twenty most commonly grown cider apple varieties, half originate from England, two come from France, and the rest originate in America. Most special cider cultivars for European ciders are bittersweets and bittersharps, which have high tannin content. There are not a lot of cultivars with high tannins readily available in the U.S. Most ciders in the United States are made from culled dessert apples that are generally sweets and sharps. There is no systematic classification of North American apple cultivars for cider-making purposes. However, there is a database for apple varieties called the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS).

===Other classification considerations===
Beyond the Long Ashton or English system and French system for classifying cider apples, there are other considerations for characterisation. Other measurements taken of apple varieties towards use in cider classification include pH, polyphenol composition, yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), and soluble solid concentration (ºBrix). The sharpness of an apple is affected by pH and titratable acidity. Most cultivars must reach pH levels of around 3.3 to 3.8 to aid in the fermentation process, and additions of malic acid may be necessary if the cider apple is over this desired threshold. Soluble solids as measured in units of degrees Brix can be used to quantify the potential alcohol that a yeast can ferment from the initial juice of the cider apple. This is carefully considered in cultivars from areas where there are tax regulations on the percentage of alcohol by volume that is contained in these products. In the United States, &quot;hard cider&quot; legally falls between the 0.5% to 8.5% alcohol by volume tax bracket. Cideries that exceed a soluble solids level of 17 °Brix will be subject to higher tax levels that are classified under cider wine. In the United Kingdom, cider falls in two duty brackets, with a flat rate for up to 7.4% ABV, and a higher duty rate for ciders between 7.4% to 8.5% ABV. Foaming is an intricate, yet essential component that can be used to assess the overall quality of a cider and distinguish between natural and sparkling ciders. Chemically, hydrophobic polypeptides contribute to the initial foam, bubble size, the extent to which it persists, number of nucleation sites, and the froth of the foam (foam collar). These chemical compositions and parameters are quantitatively measured through metrics such as foam height, foam stability height, and stability time. The olfactory sensory profile is used to determine the specific aroma of the cider. Research is still ongoing in this field, but the aromas that contribute to the sensory perceptions of cider mainly come from the phenols 4-ethyl guaiacol and 4-ethyl phenol.

==Styles==
Cider is made in several countries and can be made from any apples. Historically the flavours preferred and varieties used to produce cider have varied by region. Many of the most traditional apple varieties used for ciders come from or are derived from those from Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire in England, Normandy in France, and Asturias in Spain, and these areas are considered to have their own broad cider styles although the many exceptions make this more of a historic footnote. Normandy cider is usually naturally carbonated and clear: Asturian cider apple varieties are mainly &#x27;sharps&#x27; or mild &#x27;bittersweets&#x27;, producing a mildly acidic cider which is customarily served by being poured from height into the glass to oxygenate it.

In the UK there are two broad styles of cider, determined by the types of apple available. The style associated with the east of England (East Anglia, Kent, Sussex) used surplus dessert and cooking apples and was therefore characterised by an acidic, light-bodied cider. The other style, using specific cider apple cultivars with higher tannin levels, is usually associated with the West Country, particularly Somerset, and Three Counties. Within these broad types there are also a number of more specific regional styles. The ciders of Devon were often made largely from sweets, the cultivars low in acid and tannins that typified the county&#x27;s orchards. Devon cidermakers also specialised in &quot;keeved&quot;, or &quot;matched&quot; cider, where fermentation was slowed to produce a naturally sweet finish, though such ciders were usually intended for the London market and a fully fermented, dry &quot;rough&quot; cider was preferred for home consumption. Somerset ciders, by contrast, have tended to be stronger and more tannic. Bittersweet cultivars, locally known as &quot;Jersey&quot; apples, were typical of Somerset, although the county&#x27;s most famous apple, Kingston Black, was a mild bittersharp. The West Midland county of Gloucestershire traditionally favoured bittersharp apples, giving strong ciders with a higher bite of acidity and tannins: neighbouring Worcestershire and Herefordshire also favoured acidic cider apples, but their growers also made plantings of dual purpose apples to take advantage of markets in nearby industrial centres.

===Single varietal cider cultivars===

Historically ciders have been almost invariably made from blending apple varieties, and the practice of making single variety ciders is considered largely a modern approach. Only a very small number of apple varieties are considered to be capable of making a good single-variety cider. These fruit are designated as having &quot;vintage&quot; quality, a term first introduced by Robert Hogg in 1888, and further popularised by Barker at Long Ashton: it should be understood as referring to the cultivar&#x27;s ability to produce complex and interesting flavours, rather than in the sense &quot;vintage&quot; is used in winemaking.

*Sweet Coppin is a sweet originating in Devon;
*Sweet Alford is another Devon sweet variety;
*Crimson King is a sharp, first grown in Somerset;
*Yarlington Mill is a bittersweet, named after the mill in Somerset where it was found;
*Dabinett is a bittersweet named after William Dabinett, and is from Middle Lambrook, South Petherton, Somerset;
* Major is an old bittersweet variety, found in orchards in South Devon and east of the Blackdown Hills in south Somerset;
* Broxwood Foxwhelp is a Herefordshire bittersharp, probably a sport of the old variety Foxwhelp
*Kingston Black is a bittersharp probably named after the village of Kingston, near Taunton, Somerset;
*Stoke Red is a bittersharp originating from the village of Rodney Stoke in Somerset

Although considered suitable for single-variety ciders, they can also contribute well to blends.

== Cider apple composition ==

=== Polyphenols and tannins ===
Polyphenols are an important component of ciders, contributing astringency, bitterness, colloidal stability and colour. The content in apples varies depending on cultivar, production practices, and part of the fruit, with the peel of an apple having more polyphenols than the flesh. The primary polyphenol in apples is procyanidins, followed by hydroxycinnamic acids in the flesh and flavonols in peel. Much of the polyphenols in the fruit are not pressed into the juice, because they bind to polysaccharides in the fruit cell wall, becoming bound to the pomace, when the cell wall is ruptured during the pressing process. Procyanidins are especially prone to binding to the pomace with about 30% extracted into the juice. Cider apples can have five times the total phenolic content compared to dessert apples, but there is a limited supply of bittersweet and bittersharp apples in the U.S. to meet the needs of the fast-growing cider industry. Some cider makers add exogenous tannins to improve phenolic characteristics, and researchers are working on improving polyphenol extraction technology. In countries with more well-established cider industries, such as the U.K. and France, there is an adequate supply of high tannin cider apples. About one half of the apples processed for cider in Europe are bittersweet fruit.

== Orchard design ==

=== Traditional orchard design ===
The end of the 1950s saw a huge turn in cider apple orchard design, where before traditional styles of orchard had been maintained for centuries. Traditional orchards are now uncommon, though they can still be found in places like Spain where most growers have maintained traditional systems. Traditional orchards were designed with large spacing between individual large trees;(6–12 meters tall and spaced about 7.6–9 meters apart) typically, less than 150 trees per hectare. Trees within an orchard were more variable in age; individual trees would be grown until they died and a new tree would be planted in its place. Older trees in traditional orchards can grow gnarled and hollowed for the tree&#x27;s entire lifespan. The large (7.6 meter) spherical-shaped canopies of traditional methods differ from various planting systems that use conic, flat planar or v-shaped styles. Traditional orchards were often intercropped: it was particularly common to use a silvopastoral system that combined fruit trees and pasture. The natural grasses forming the orchard&#x27;s undergrowth were often grazed by sheep or cows: the English &quot;grass orchard&quot; was particularly associated with cider producing districts. Management techniques did not use fertiliser or chemicals, other than the natural fertilisation from the dung of grazing cattle, and generally required less training than modern, high-density systems. Budding of scions took place high up in the tree, typically using vigorous rootstocks or seedlings. Traditional orchards have been found to produce apples with lower nitrogen content and higher polyphenolic levels.

In recent years, there has been a decline in the numbers of traditional cider orchards and a corresponding loss of orchard design knowledge between generations of apple growers. Traditional orchards have, for example decreased by about 20% since 1994 in parts of Germany. The decline is partly attributed to the high maintenance demands of large trees and the physical limitations for apple pickers, the low yield (10-12 tons per hectare,) the slow cropping of trees (15 years compared to the average 8 years of high-density orchards,) and historical changes in regional alcohol preferences. During the 1950s, France subsidised growers who converted to high-density orchards. By the 1990s, most of France no longer used traditional orchard styles. By the 1970s, traditional style orchards were only used for making 25% of the cider in the United Kingdom.

=== Bush orchards ===

In response to the rising demand for cider apples in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, the Long Ashton Research Station developed the bush orchard system commonly used in the UK today. Cider apple varieties are grafted onto semi-dwarfing rootstocks and reach a maximum height of 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 m). Trees are planted at a density of approximately 750 per hectare, with trees spaced 2 – 3 m (6.5–10 ft) apart in rows 5.5 m (18 ft) wide. Although more densely planted than a traditional orchard, rows are still wide enough for tractors, harvesters, and other machinery to access the rows. Unlike a high density orchard, trees are free standing and are not supported by a trellis. Bush orchards can yield 2-3 times as much as a traditional orchard, up to 35-50 tons per hectare. The bush orchard style became especially popular in the 1970s after the H.P. Bulmer and Taunton Cider companies established Incentive Planting Schemes, which rewarded farmers for planting bush orchards of cider apple varieties. Today, approximately two thirds of cider apples in the United Kingdom are grown in bush orchards.

=== High density orchards ===
High density planting became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, and is a common method of growing cider apples outside of the United Kingdom. The average high density orchard contains about 1,000 trees per acre, although some orchards in Europe and the Pacific Northwest may contain up to 9,000 trees per acre. Trees in high density orchards are grafted onto a precocious dwarfing rootstock that keeps the tree small and encourages early fruit production, with trees often bearing within two to three years of planting. This allows growers to bring new varieties of apple to market more quickly than they could with traditional, more widely spaced orchard designs that are slower to mature. Because trees grown on a dwarfing rootstock are small and thin, they must be supported by a trellis system. Rows are spaced depending on the height of the mature tree, usually half the tree height plus three feet (approximately 1m). High density orchards are more labor efficient than traditional orchards, as workers do not need to climb ladders during maintenance or harvest Pesticide application is also more efficient, as chemicals can be applied by over-the-row sprayers, fixed in-canopy systems, or other devices that reduce pesticide waste.

=== Tree types and planting systems ===
With the move to higher density plantings, different tree types and planting systems have been developed, and are used around the world. These systems include:

Central leader trees are commonly grown in a conical shape, with a central vertical shoot (the central leader), and horizontal larger branches at the bottom decreasing to smaller branches near the top. Central leader trees grown with standard or semi dwarf rootstocks are large and free standing, unlike modern high density plantings. The central leader system has been adjusted in recent years to suit the requirements of modern orchard designs and high density plantings.

An example of this is slender spindle. While there are different forms, slender spindle trees have the same tapered design. Top branches are regularly renewed by pruning, or weakened by bending. A less vigorous rootstock is used to limit growth, creating a smaller tree, usually individually staked for support of heavy cropping.

Solaxe and vertical axis systems are similar to both central leader and slender spindle, and has been used as a transition from low density plantings to high density plantings. Tree size is determined by rootstock, ranging from semi dwarf to fully dwarf. The trees require a form of support. These systems aim to create an equilibrium between fruiting and vegetative growth, receiving minimal pruning. Solaxe uses limb bending to control vigour, a modification from vertical axis which uses periodical pruning.

Super spindle orchard design utilises high density planting, with up to or over 2000 trees/acre. The benefits of high density include high early yields with reduced inputs such as labour due to reduced manual work and the ability to have high output picking during harvest. High density plantings are grown with a trellis system for tree support.

Tall spindle shares many of the high density benefits as super spindle, and is a combination of slender spindle, vertical axis, solaxe and super spindle systems. It utilises high density planting on dwarfing rootstocks with a range between 2,500 and 3,300 trees/acre. Tall spindle systems utilise minimal pruning at planting, and uses branch bending to control growth, and limb pruning to renew branches as they become too large. As tree height exceeds 90% of the row spacing, fruit quality at the lower parts of the tree may be reduced.

<text>A snakebite is an alcoholic drink made with equal parts lager and cider. If a dash of blackcurrant cordial is added, it is known as a &quot;Diesel&quot; or a &quot;Snakebite and Black&quot;. It was first popularised in the UK in the 1980s.

==Availability in the UK==
A snakebite is typically served in a pint glass. Serving a snakebite from separate cider and lager taps or bottles is legal in the UK, despite sources that suggest otherwise. In 2001, former US President Bill Clinton was refused a snakebite when he ordered one at the Old Bell Tavern in Harrogate, North Yorkshire as a consequence of this myth.

<text>A snakebite is an injury caused by the bite of a snake, especially a venomous snake. A common sign of a bite from a venomous snake is the presence of two puncture wounds from the animal&#x27;s fangs. Sometimes venom injection from the bite may occur. This may result in redness, swelling, and severe pain at the area, which may take up to an hour to appear. Vomiting, blurred vision, tingling of the limbs, and sweating may result. Most bites are on the hands, arms, or legs. Fear following a bite is common with symptoms of a racing heart and feeling faint. The venom may cause bleeding, kidney failure, a severe allergic reaction, tissue death around the bite, or breathing problems. Bites may result in the loss of a limb or other chronic problems or even death.

The outcome depends on the type of snake, the area of the body bitten, the amount of snake venom injected, the general health of the person bitten, and whether or not anti-venom serum has been administered by a doctor in a timely manner. Problems are often more severe in children than adults, due to their smaller size. Allergic reactions to snake venom can further complicate outcomes and can include anaphylaxis, requiring additional treatment and in some cases resulting in death.
Snakes bite both as a method of hunting and as a means of protection. Risk factors for bites include working outside with one&#x27;s hands such as in farming, forestry, and construction. Snakes commonly involved in envenomations include elapids (such as kraits, cobras and mambas), vipers, and sea snakes. The majority of snake species do not have venom and kill their prey by constriction (squeezing them). Venomous snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Determining the type of snake that caused a bite is often not possible. The World Health Organization says snakebites are a &quot;neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries&quot;, and in 2017, the WHO categorized snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease (Category A). The WHO also estimates that between 4.5 and 5.4 million people are bitten each year, and of those figures, 40–50% develop some kind of clinical illness as a result. Furthermore, the death toll from such an injury could range between 80,000 and 130,000 people per year. The purpose was to encourage research, expand the accessibility of antivenoms, and improve snakebite management in &quot;developing countries&quot;.
Prevention of snake bites can involve wearing protective footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly depends on the type of snake. Washing the wound with soap and water and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends on the type of snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world, getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person&#x27;s breathing is sometimes also required.
The number of venomous snakebites that occur each year may be as high as five million. They result in about 2.5 million envenomations and 20,000 to 125,000 deaths. The frequency and severity of bites vary greatly among different parts of the world. They occur most commonly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with rural areas more greatly affected. Deaths are relatively rare in Australia, Europe and North America. For example, in the United States, about seven to eight thousand people per year are bitten by venomous snakes (about one in 40 thousand people) and about five people die (about one death per 65 million people).
== Signs and symptoms ==
The most common first symptom of all snakebites is an overwhelming fear, which may contribute to other symptoms, and may include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, vertigo, fainting, tachycardia, and cold, clammy skin. Snake bites can have a variety of different signs and symptoms depending on their species.

Dry snakebites and those inflicted by a non-venomous species may still cause severe injury. The bite may become infected from the snake&#x27;s saliva. The fangs sometimes harbor pathogenic microbial organisms, including &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;, and may require an updated tetanus immunization.

Most snakebites, from either a venomous or a non-venomous snake, will have some type of local effect. Minor pain and redness occur in over 90 percent of cases, although this varies depending on the site. Bites by vipers and some cobras may be extremely painful, with the local tissue sometimes becoming tender and severely swollen within five minutes. This area may also bleed and blister and may lead to tissue necrosis. Other common initial symptoms of pit viper and viper bites include lethargy, bleeding, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms may become more life-threatening over time, developing into hypotension, tachypnea, severe tachycardia, severe internal bleeding, altered sensorium, kidney failure, and respiratory failure.

Bites by some snakes, such as the kraits, coral snake, Mojave rattlesnake, and the speckled rattlesnake, may cause little or no pain, despite their serious and potentially life-threatening venom. Some people report experiencing a &quot;rubbery&quot;, &quot;minty&quot;, or &quot;metallic&quot; taste after being bitten by certain species of rattlesnake. Spitting cobras and rinkhalses can spit venom in a person&#x27;s eyes. This results in immediate pain, ophthalmoparesis, and sometimes blindness.

Some Australian elapids and most viper envenomations will cause coagulopathy, sometimes so severe that a person may bleed spontaneously from the mouth, nose, and even old, seemingly healed wounds. Internal organs may bleed, including the brain and intestines, and ecchymosis (bruising) of the skin is often seen.

The venom of elapids, including sea snakes, kraits, cobras, king cobra, mambas, and many Australian species, contains toxins which attack the nervous system, causing neurotoxicity. The person may present with strange disturbances to their vision, including blurriness. Paresthesia throughout the body, as well as difficulty in speaking and breathing, may be reported. Nervous system problems will cause a huge array of symptoms, and those provided here are not exhaustive. If not treated immediately they may die from respiratory failure.

Venom emitted from some types of cobras, almost all vipers, and some sea snakes cause necrosis of muscle tissue. Muscle tissue will begin to die throughout the body, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can result in damage to the kidneys as a result of myoglobin accumulation in the renal tubules. This, coupled with hypotension, can lead to acute kidney injury, and, if left untreated, eventually death.

Snakebite is also known to cause depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in a high proportion of people who survive.

== Cause ==

In the developing world most snakebites occur in those who work outside such as farmers, hunters, and fishermen. They often happen when a person steps on the snake or approaches it too closely. In the United States and Europe snakebites most commonly occur in those who keep them as pets.

The type of snake that most often delivers serious bites depends on the region of the world. In Africa, it is mambas, Egyptian cobras, puff adders, and carpet vipers. In the Middle East, it is carpet vipers and elapids. In Latin America, it is snakes of the &quot;Bothrops&quot; and &quot;Crotalus&quot; types, the latter including rattlesnakes. In North America, rattlesnakes are the primary concern, and up to 95% of all snakebite-related deaths in the United States are attributed to the western and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes. The greatest number of bites are inflicted on the hands. People get bitten by handling snakes or in the outdoors by putting their hands on the wrong places. The next largest number of bites occur on the ankles, as snakes are often hidden or camouflaged extremely well to fend off predators. Most bite victims are bitten by surprise, and it is a comfortable fiction that rattlesnakes always forewarn their bite victims - often the bite is the first indication a snake is near. Since most venomous snakes move about during the dawn dusk or night, one may expect more encounters during the early morning or late afternoon, though many species such as the Western Diamondback may be encountered at any time of day and in fact most bites occur during the month of April when both snakes and humans are out and about and encounter one another hiking, in yards, or on pathways. Children playing within short distances of their homes crawl under porches, jump into bushes, pull boards of wood from a pile and are bitten. Most however occur when people handle rattlesnakes. In South Asia, it was previously believed that Indian cobras, common kraits, Russell&#x27;s viper, and carpet vipers were the most dangerous; other snakes, however, may also cause significant problems in this area of the world.

== Pathophysiology ==
Since envenomation is completely voluntary, all venomous snakes are capable of biting without injecting venom into a person. Snakes may deliver such a &quot;dry bite&quot; rather than waste their venom on a creature too large for them to eat, a behaviour called venom metering. However, the percentage of dry bites varies among species: 80 percent of bites inflicted by sea snakes, which are normally timid, do not result in envenomation, whereas for pit viper bites the number is closer to 25 percent. Furthermore, some snake genera, such as rattlesnakes, can internally regulate the amount of venom they inject. There is a wide variance in the composition of venoms from one species of venomous snake to another. Some venoms may have their greatest effect on a victim&#x27;s respiration or circulatory system. Others may damage or destroy tissues. This variance has imparted to the venom of each species a distinct chemistry. Sometimes antivenins have to be developed for individual species. For this reason, standard therapeutic measures will not work in all cases.

Some dry bites may also be the result of imprecise timing on the snake&#x27;s part, as venom may be prematurely released before the fangs have penetrated the person. Even without venom, some snakes, particularly large constrictors such as those belonging to the Boidae and Pythonidae families, can deliver damaging bites; large specimens often cause severe lacerations, or the snake itself pulls away, causing the flesh to be torn by the needle-sharp recurved teeth embedded in the person. While not as life-threatening as a bite from a venomous species, the bite can be at least temporarily debilitating and could lead to dangerous infections if improperly dealt with.

While most snakes must open their mouths before biting, African and Middle Eastern snakes belonging to the family Atractaspididae can fold their fangs to the side of their head without opening their mouth and jab a person.

=== Snake venom ===

It has been suggested that snakes evolved the mechanisms necessary for venom formation and delivery sometime during the Miocene epoch. During the mid-Tertiary, most snakes were large ambush predators belonging to the superfamily Henophidia, which use constriction to kill their prey. As open grasslands replaced forested areas in parts of the world, some snake families evolved to become smaller and thus more agile. However, subduing and killing prey became more difficult for the smaller snakes, leading to the evolution of snake venom. The most likely hypothesis holds that venom glands evolved from specialized salivary glands. The venom itself evolved through the process of natural selection; it retained and emphasized the qualities that made it useful in killing or subduing prey. Today we can find various snake species in stages of this hypothesized development. There are the highly efficient envenoming machines - like the rattlesnakes - with large capacity venom storage, hollow fangs that swing into position immediately before the snake bites, and spare fangs ready to replace those damaged or lost. Other research on Toxicofera, a hypothetical clade thought to be ancestral to most living reptiles, suggests an earlier time frame for the evolution of snake venom, possibly to the order of tens of millions of years, during the Late Cretaceous.

Snake venom is produced in modified parotid glands normally responsible for secreting saliva. It is stored in structures called behind the animal&#x27;s eyes and ejected voluntarily through its hollow tubular fangs.

Venom in many snakes, such as pit vipers, affects virtually every organ system in the human body and can be a combination of many toxins, including cytotoxins, hemotoxins, neurotoxins, and myotoxins, allowing for an enormous variety of symptoms. Snake venom may cause cytotoxicity as various enzymes including hyaluronidases, collagenases, proteinases and phospholipases lead to breakdown (dermonecrosis) and injury of local tissue and inflammation which leads to pain, edema and blister formation. Metalloproteinases further lead to breakdown of the extracellular matrix (releasing inflammatory mediators) and cause microvascular damage, leading to hemorrhage, skeletal muscle damage (necrosis), blistering and further dermonecrosis. The metalloproteinase release of the inflammatory mediators leads to pain, swelling, and white blood cell (leukocyte) infiltration. The lymphatic system may be damaged by the various enzymes contained in the venom leading to edema; or the lymphatic system may also allow the venom to be carried systemically. Snake venom may cause muscle damage or myotoxicity via the enzyme phospholipase A2 which disrupts the plasma membrane of muscle cells. This damage to muscle cells may cause rhabdomyolysis, respiratory muscle compromise, or both. Other enzymes such as bradykinin potentiating peptides, natriuretic peptides, vascular endothelial growth factors, proteases can also cause hypotension or low blood pressure. Toxins in snake venom can also cause kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) via the same inflammatory cytokines. The toxins cause direct damage to the glomeruli in the kidneys as well as causing protein deposits in Bowman&#x27;s capsule. Or the kidneys may be indirectly damaged by envenomation due to shock, clearance of toxic substances such as immune complexes, blood degradation products, or products of muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).

In venom-induced consumption coagulopathy, toxins in snake venom promote hemorrhage via activation, consumption, and subsequent depletion of clotting factors in the blood. These clotting factors normally work as part of the coagulation cascade in the blood to form blood clots and prevent hemorrhage. Toxins in snake venom (especially the venom of New World pit vipers (the family crotalina)) may also cause low platelets (thrombocytopenia) or altered platelet function also leading to bleeding.

Snake venom is known to cause neuromuscular paralysis, usually as a flaccid paralysis that is descending; starting at the facial muscles, causing ptosis or drooping eyelids and dysarthria or poor articulation of speech, and descending to the respiratory muscles causing respiratory compromise. The neurotoxins can either bind to and block membrane receptors at the post-synaptic neurons or they can be taken up into the pre-synaptic neuron cells and impair neurotransmitter release. Venom toxins that are taken up intra-cellularly, into the cells of the pre-synaptic neurons are much more difficult to reverse using anti-venom as they are inaccessible to the anti-venom when they are intracellular.

The strength of venom differs markedly between species and even more so between families, as measured by median lethal dose (LD50) in mice. Subcutaneous LD50 varies by over 140-fold within elapids and by more than 100-fold in vipers. The amount of venom produced also differs among species, with the Gaboon viper able to potentially deliver from 450 to 600 milligrams of venom in a single bite, the most of any snake. Opisthoglyphous colubrids have venom ranging from life-threatening (in the case of the boomslang) to barely noticeable (as in &quot;Tantilla&quot;).

== Prevention ==
Snakes are most likely to bite when they feel threatened, are startled, are provoked, or when they have been cornered. Snakes are likely to approach residential areas when attracted by prey, such as rodents. Regular pest control can reduce the threat of snakes considerably. It is beneficial to know the species of snake that are common in local areas, or while travelling or hiking. Africa, Australia, the Neotropics, and South Asia in particular are populated by many dangerous species of snake. Being aware of—and ultimately avoiding—areas known to be heavily populated by dangerous snakes is strongly recommended.

When in the wilderness, treading heavily creates ground vibrations and noise, which will often cause snakes to flee from the area. However, this generally only applies to vipers, as some larger and more aggressive snakes in other parts of the world, such as mambas and cobras, will respond more aggressively. If presented with a direct encounter, it is best to remain silent and motionless. If the snake has not yet fled, it is important to step away slowly and cautiously.

The use of a flashlight when engaged in camping activities, such as gathering firewood at night, can be helpful. Snakes may also be unusually active during especially warm nights when ambient temperatures exceed . It is advised not to reach blindly into hollow logs, flip over large rocks, and enter old cabins or other potential snake hiding places. When rock climbing, it is not safe to grab ledges or crevices without examining them first, as snakes are cold-blooded and often sunbathe atop rock ledges.

In the United States, more than 40 percent of people bitten by snakes intentionally put themselves in harm&#x27;s way by attempting to capture wild snakes or by carelessly handling their dangerous pets—40 percent of that number had a blood alcohol level of 0.1 percent or more.

It is also important to avoid snakes that appear to be dead, as some species will roll over on their backs and stick out their tongue to fool potential threats. A snake&#x27;s detached head can immediately act by reflex and potentially bite. The induced bite can be just as severe as that of a live snake.
As a dead snake is incapable of regulating the venom injected, a bite from a dead snake can often contain large amounts of venom.

== Treatment ==
It may be difficult to determine if a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a bite to a child&#x27;s abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the type of snake, the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment. An overview of systematic reviews on different aspects of snakebite management found that the evidence base from majority of treatment modalities is low quality. An analysis of World Health Organization guidelines found that they are of low quality, with inadequate stakeholder involvement and poor methodological rigour. In addition, access to effective treatment modalities is a major challenge in some regions, particularly in most African countries.

=== Snake identification ===
Identification of the snake is important in planning treatment in certain areas of the world but is not always possible. Ideally, the dead snake would be brought in with the person, but in areas where snake bite is more common, local knowledge may be sufficient to recognize the snake. However, in regions where polyvalent antivenoms are available, such as North America, identification of snakes is not a high-priority item. Attempting to catch or kill the offending snake also puts one at risk for re-envenomation or creating a second person bitten, and generally is not recommended.

The three types of venomous snakes that cause the majority of major clinical problems are vipers, kraits, and cobras. Knowledge of what species are present locally can be crucial, as is knowledge of typical signs and symptoms of envenomation by each type of snake. A scoring system can be used to try to determine the biting snake based on clinical features, but these scoring systems are extremely specific to particular geographical areas and might be compromised by the presence of escaped or released non-native species.

=== First aid ===
Snakebite first aid recommendations vary, in part because different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom in the region of the bite by pressure immobilization is desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy. Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary.

Many organizations, including the American Medical Association and American Red Cross, recommend washing the bite with soap and water. Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment are against cleaning the wound. Traces of venom left on the skin/bandages from the strike can be used in combination with a snake bite identification kit to identify the species of snake. This speeds the determination of which antivenom to administer in the emergency room.

=== Pressure immobilization ===

As of 2008, clinical evidence for pressure immobilization via the use of an elastic bandage is limited. It is recommended for snakebites that have occurred in Australia (due to elapids which are neurotoxic). It is not recommended for bites from non-neurotoxic snakes such as those found in North America and other regions of the world. The British military recommends pressure immobilization in all cases where the type of snake is unknown.

The object of pressure immobilization is to contain venom within a bitten limb and prevent it from moving through the lymphatic system to the vital organs. This therapy has two components: pressure to prevent lymphatic drainage, and immobilization of the bitten limb to prevent the pumping action of the skeletal muscles.

=== Antivenom ===
Until the advent of antivenom, bites from some species of snake were almost universally fatal. Despite huge advances in emergency therapy, antivenom is often still the only effective treatment for envenomation. The first antivenom was developed in 1895 by French physician Albert Calmette for the treatment of Indian cobra bites. Antivenom is made by injecting a small amount of venom into an animal (usually a horse or sheep) to initiate an immune system response. The resulting antibodies are then harvested from the animal&#x27;s blood.

Antivenom is injected into the person intravenously, and works by binding to and neutralizing venom enzymes. It cannot undo the damage already caused by venom, so antivenom treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Modern antivenoms are usually polyvalent, making them effective against the venom of numerous snake species. Pharmaceutical companies that produce antivenom target their products against the species native to a particular area. The availability of antivenom is a major concern in some areas, including most of Africa, due to economic reasons (antivenom crisis). In Sub-Saharan Africa, the efficacy of antivenom is often poorly characterised and some of the few available products have even been found to lack effectiveness.

Although some people may develop serious adverse reactions to antivenom, such as anaphylaxis, in emergency situations this is usually treatable in a hospital setting and hence the benefit outweighs the potential consequences of not using antivenom. Giving adrenaline (epinephrine) to prevent adverse reactions to antivenom before they occur might be reasonable in cases where they occur commonly. Antihistamines do not appear to provide any benefit in preventing adverse reactions.

=== Chronic Complications ===
Chronic health effects of snakebite include but are not limited to non-healing and chronic ulcers, musculoskeletal disorders, amputations, chronic kidney disease, and other neurological and endocrine complications. The treatment of chronic complications of snakebite has not been well researched and there a systems approach consisting of a multi-component intervention.

=== Outmoded ===

The following treatments, while once recommended, are considered of no use or harmful, including tourniquets, incisions, suction, application of cold, and application of electricity. Cases in which these treatments appear to work may be the result of dry bites.
* Application of a tourniquet to the bitten limb is generally not recommended. There is no convincing evidence that it is an effective first-aid tool as ordinarily applied. Tourniquets have been found to be completely ineffective in the treatment of &quot;Crotalus durissus&quot; bites, but some positive results have been seen with properly applied tourniquets for cobra venom in the Philippines. Uninformed tourniquet use is dangerous since reducing or cutting off circulation can lead to gangrene, which can be fatal. The use of a compression bandage is generally as effective, and much safer.
* Cutting open the bitten area, an action often taken before suction, is not recommended since it causes further damage and increases the risk of infection; the subsequent cauterization of the area with fire or silver nitrate (also known as &quot;infernal stone&quot;) is also potentially threatening.
* Sucking out venom, either by mouth or with a pump, does not work and may harm the affected area directly. Suction started after three minutes removes a clinically insignificant quantity—less than one-thousandth of the venom injected—as shown in a human study. In a study with pigs, suction not only caused no improvement but led to necrosis in the suctioned area. Suctioning by mouth presents a risk of further poisoning through the mouth&#x27;s mucous tissues. The helper may also release bacteria into the person&#x27;s wound, leading to infection.
* Immersion in warm water or sour milk, followed by the application of snake-stones (also known as &quot;la Pierre Noire&quot;), which are believed to draw off the poison in much the way a sponge soaks up water.
* Application of a one-percent solution of potassium permanganate or chromic acid to the cut, exposed area. The latter substance is notably toxic and carcinogenic.
* Drinking abundant quantities of alcohol following the cauterization or disinfection of the wound area.
* Use of electroshock therapy in animal tests has shown this treatment to be useless and potentially dangerous.

In extreme cases, in remote areas, all of these misguided attempts at treatment have resulted in injuries far worse than an otherwise mild to moderate snakebite. In worst-case scenarios, thoroughly constricting tourniquets have been applied to bitten limbs, completely shutting off blood flow to the area. By the time the person finally reached appropriate medical facilities, their limbs had to be amputated.

=== In development ===
Several new drugs and treatments are under development for snakebite. For instance, the metal chelator dimercaprol has recently been shown to potently antagonize the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinases &quot;in vitro&quot;. New monoclonal antibodies, polymer gels and a small molecule inhibitor called Varespladib are in development. A core outcome set (minimal list of consensus outcomes that should be used in future intervention research) for snakebite in South Asia is being developed.

== Epidemiology ==


Earlier estimates for snakebite vary from 1.2 to 5.5 million, with 421,000 to 2.5 million being envenomings, and causing 20,000 to 125,000 deaths. More recent modelling estimates that in 2019, about 63,400 people died globally from snakebite, with 51,100 of these deaths happening in India. Since reporting is not mandatory in much of the world, the data on the frequency of snakebites is not precise. Many people who survive bites have permanent tissue damage caused by venom, leading to disability. Most snake envenomings and fatalities occur in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, with India reporting the most snakebite deaths of any country. Available evidence on the effect of climate change on the epidemiology of snakebite is limited but it is expected that there will be a geographic shift in the risk of snakebite: northwards in North America and southwards in South America and Mozambique, and increase in the incidence of bite in Sri Lanka.

Most snakebites are caused by non-venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are considered dangerous to humans. Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica. The most diverse and widely distributed snake family, the colubrids, has approximately 700 venomous species, but only five genera—boomslangs, twig snakes, keelback snakes, green snakes, and slender snakes—have caused human fatalities.

Worldwide, snakebites occur most frequently in the summer season when snakes are active and humans are outdoors. Agricultural and tropical regions report more snakebites than anywhere else. In the United States, those bitten are typically male and between 17 and 27 years of age. Children and the elderly are the most likely to die.

== Mechanics ==
When venomous snakes bite a target, they secrete venom through their venom delivery system. The venom delivery system generally consists of two venom glands, a compressor muscle, venom ducts, a fang sheath, and fangs. The primary and accessory venom glands store the venom quantities required during envenomation. The compressor muscle contracts during bites to increase the pressure throughout the venom delivery system. The pressurized venom travels through the primary venom duct to the secondary venom duct that leads down through the fang sheath and fang. The venom is then expelled through the exit orifice of the fang. The total volume and flow rate of venom administered into a target varies widely, sometimes as much as an order of magnitude. One of the largest factors is snake species and size, larger snakes have been shown to administer larger quantities of venom.

=== Predatory vs. defensive bites ===
Snake bites are classified as either predatory or defensive. During defensive strikes, the rate of venom expulsion and total volume of venom expelled is much greater than during predatory strikes. Defensive strikes can have 10 times as much venom volume expelled at 8.5 times the flow rate. This can be explained by the snake&#x27;s need to quickly subdue a threat. While employing similar venom expulsion mechanics, predatory strikes are quite different from defensive strikes. Snakes usually release the prey shortly after the envenomation allowing the prey to run away and die. Releasing prey prevents retaliatory damage to the snake. The venom scent allows the snake to relocate the prey once it is deceased. The amount of venom injected has been shown to increase with the mass of the prey animal. Larger venom volumes allow snakes to effectively euthanize larger prey while remaining economical during strikes against smaller prey. This is an important skill as venom is a metabolically expensive resource.

=== Venom Metering ===
Venom metering is the ability of a snake to have neurological control over the amount of venom released into a target during a strike based on situational cues. This ability would prove useful as venom is a limited resource, larger animals are less susceptible to the effects of venom, and various situations require different levels of force. There is a lot of evidence to support the venom metering hypothesis. For example, snakes frequently use more venom during defensive strikes, administer more venom to larger prey, and are capable of dry biting. A dry bite is a bite from a venomous snake that results in very little or no venom expulsion, leaving the target asymptomatic. However, there is debate among many academics about venom metering in snakes. The alternative to venom metering is the pressure balance hypothesis.

The pressure balance hypothesis cites the retraction of the fang sheath as the many mechanisms for producing outward venom flow from the venom delivery system. When isolated, fang sheath retraction has experimentally been shown to induce very high pressures in the venom delivery system. A similar method was used to stimulate the compressor musculature, the main muscle responsible for the contraction and squeezing of the venom gland, and then measuring the induced pressures. It was determined that the pressure created from the fang sheath retraction was at times an order of magnitude greater than those created by the compressor musculature. Snakes do not have direct neurological control of the fang sheath, it can only be retracted as the fangs enter a target and the target&#x27;s skin and body provide substantial resistance to retract the sheath. For these reasons, the pressure balance hypothesis concludes that external factors, mainly the bite and physical mechanics, are responsible for the quantity of venom expelled.

=== Venom Spitting ===
Venom spitting is another venom delivery method that is unique to some Asiatic and African cobras. In venom spitting, a stream of venom is propelled at very high pressures outwards up to 3 meters (300 centimeters). The venom stream is usually aimed at the eyes and face of the target as a deterrent for predators. There are non-spitting cobras that provide useful information on the unique mechanics behind venom spitting. Unlike the elongated oval shaped exit orifices of non-spitting cobras, spitting cobras have circular exit orifice at their fang tips. This combined with the ability to partially retract their fang sheath by displacing the palato-maxillary arch and contracting the adductor mandibulae, allows the spitting cobras to create large pressures within the venom delivery system. While venom spitting is a less common venom delivery system, the venom can still cause the effects if ingested.

== Society and culture ==
Snakes were both revered and worshipped and feared by early civilizations. The ancient Egyptians recorded prescribed treatments for snakebites as early as the Thirteenth Dynasty in the Brooklyn Papyrus, which includes at least seven venomous species common to the region today, such as the horned vipers. In Judaism, the Nehushtan was a pole with a snake made of copper fixed upon it. The object was regarded as a divinely empowered instrument of God that could bring healing to Jews bitten by venomous snakes while they were wandering in the desert after their exodus from Egypt. Healing was said to occur by merely looking at the object as it was held up by Moses.

Historically, snakebites were seen as a means of execution in some cultures. Reportedly, in Southern Han during China&#x27;s Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and in India a form of capital punishment was to throw people into snake pits, leaving people to die from multiple venomous bites. According to popular belief, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII committed suicide by letting herself be bitten by an asp—likely an Egyptian cobra—after hearing of Mark Antony&#x27;s death, while some contemporary ancient authors rather assumed a direct application of poison.

Snakebite as a surreptitious form of murder has been featured in stories such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, but actual occurrences are virtually unheard of, with only a few documented cases. It has been suggested that Boris III of Bulgaria, who was allied to Nazi Germany during World War II, may have been killed with snake venom, although there is no definitive evidence. At least one attempted suicide by snakebite has been documented in medical literature involving a puff adder bite to the hand.

In Jainism, the goddess Padmāvatī has been associated with curing snakebites.

==Research==
In 2018, the World Health Organization listed snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. In 2019, they launched a strategy to prevent and control snakebite envenoming, which involved a program targeting affected communities and their health systems. A policy analysis however found that the placement of snakebite in the global health agenda of WHO is fragile due to reluctance to accept the disease in the neglected tropical disease community and the perceived colonial nature of the network driving the agenda.

Key institutions conducting snakebite research on snakebite are the George Institute for Global Health, the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the Indian Institute of Science.

==Other animals==
Several animals acquired immunity against the venom of snakes that occur in the same habitat. This has been documented in some humans as well.

<doc id="715937" wikidata="Q1133984" url="?curid=715937" title="Ralph Lane">
<text>Sir Ralph Lane (c. 1532 – October 1603) was an English explorer of the Elizabethan era. He helped colonise the Kingdom of Ireland in 1583 and was sheriff of County Kerry, Ireland, from 1583 to 1585. He was part of the unsuccessful attempt in 1585 to colonise Roanoke Island, North Carolina. He was knighted by the Queen in 1593.

==Early life and education==
According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, his parents were Sir Ralph Lane of Orlingbury, Hogshaw and Horton, and Maud Lane, a cousin of Katherine Parr, the last Queen Consort of Henry VIII.

He was the brother of Robert Lane.

Lane&#x27;s seal bore the arms of Lane of Horton (Cal State Papers Ireland 15 March 1598–9), and the arms assigned him by Burke quarter these with those of Maud Parr (General Armoury). In his correspondence, he speaks of nephews William and Robert Lane (Cal State Papers Ireland 26 Dec 1592, 7 June 1595), of a kinsman John Durrant (ib) and is associated with a Mr Feilding (ib 23 June 1593), all of whom appear in the Lane pedigree (Blore Hist. and Antig. of Rutlandshire p 169). William Feilding married Dorothy Lane, a daughter of Sir Ralph Lane of Horton, and John Durrant was the husband of Catherine, her first cousin.&quot;

==Career==
Lane was made Member of Parliament for Higham Ferrers in 1556. The choice was surprising, though it may be explained by the connections Lane had in the area, including with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire as well as his London residence, intended to be less costly than if he had served from Higham Ferrers itself.

Lane began serving the Crown in 1563 as an equerry under Queen Elizabeth I. His duties as an officer of the Royal Household included law enforcement and collection of customs duties. He served against the northern rebels in 1569, was commissioner of piracy in 1571 and a captain in the Netherlands in 1572–3. He was elected Member of Parliament for Higham Ferrers in 1558 and for Northampton in 1563.

==Roanoke colony==

Lane is best remembered for his attempt to establish a settlement on Roanoke Island at the request of Sir Walter Raleigh. Queen Elizabeth was looking for places to colonise and the Americas appeared ripe for English expansion. The voyage began on 9 April 1585, when Lane set sail from Plymouth with Raleigh&#x27;s cousin, Sir Richard Grenville, a sailor who upon return to England wrote a book about his findings in the Chesapeake. The fleet comprised the &quot;Tiger&quot; (Grenville&#x27;s), the &quot;Roebuck&quot;, the &quot;Red Lion&quot;, the &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, and the &quot;Dorothy&quot;. The voyage on the &quot;Tiger&quot; proved difficult, as Lane quarrelled with the aggressive leadership of Grenville, whom he found a person of &quot;intolerable pride and insatiable ambition&quot;. Unfortunately, during a severe storm off the coast of Portugal, the &quot;Tiger&quot; was separated from the rest of the fleet. &quot; The Tiger&quot; arrived on 11 May to Baye&#x27;s Muskito (Guayanilla, Puerto Rico). While waiting for the other ships, Grenville established relations with the Spanish (whilst at the same time participating in privateering against their ships) and also built a small fortress. The &quot;Elizabeth&quot; arrived shortly after construction of the fortress.

Finally, Grenville grew tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on 7 June. The fort was abandoned and its location is now unknown. When the &quot;Tiger&quot; sailed through the Ocracoke Inlet on 26 June, she ran aground on a sand bank, ruining most of the food supply. The expedition managed to repair the ship, and in early July met the &quot;Roebuck&quot; and &quot;Dorothy&quot;, which had come to the Outer Banks a few weeks earlier. The &quot;Red Lion&quot; had accompanied them, but simply landed its passengers and sailed to Newfoundland for privateering. After an initial exploration of the continental coast and its Indian settlements, Grenville accused the natives of one village Aquascogoc of stealing a silver cup and in retaliation looted and burned the village.

Despite this incident and the shortage of food, Lane and 107 other settlers were left on Roanoke Island, Virginia, on 17 August 1585 to establish a colony on its north end. They built a small fort, probably similar to the one at Guayanilla Bay, but Lane and Grenville fell out with each other, a foretaste of the troubles that dogged the colony until the end. In the bitter correspondence with London that was to ensue, Lane was described as vain, boastful, and fiery-tempered, brooking little opposition. Almost immediately, Grenville and his crew set sail for England, promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies. Contact was quickly made with the local Native Americans. The English treated them with suspicious harshness; on several occasions the colonists kidnapped Indians to extort supplies or extract information. Lane&#x27;s military background led him to rely more upon arms than diplomacy, and that approach soured his dealings with the natives from the start.

April 1586 passed with no news of Grenville. In June, the incident of the stolen cup led to a retaliatory attack against the fort that the settlers were able to repel. Also in June, Sir Francis Drake arrived at Roanoke and offered Lane and his men a return voyage to England, which Lane readily accepted because of a weakened food supply and increased tensions with local tribes. Drake&#x27;s fleet reached Portsmouth on 28 July, at which the settlers of Roanoke introduced snuff, corn, and potatoes to England. &quot;The Account of Ralph Lane&quot; first appeared in Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principall Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; in 1589.

The Grenville relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake&#x27;s departure with the settlers. Finding the colony abandoned, Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force, leaving behind a small detachment to maintain a British presence and protect Raleigh&#x27;s claim to Virginia.

Lane later participated in other expeditions. In January 1592 he was appointed muster-master general of Ireland and was knighted the following year by Sir William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy of Ireland.

==Death==
In 1594, Lane was severely wounded during the Nine Years&#x27; War in Ireland. He never fully recovered and died in 1603 at Dublin, where he was buried in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

<text>Charles David Tom (born March 23, 1978) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the roles of Billy Abbott on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (1999 to 2002, 2013 to 2014) and Paul Cramer on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (2004). He won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in 2000 for his work on &quot;The Young and the Restless.&quot; 
== Early life ==
Tom was born in Hinsdale, Illinois. He is the twin brother of actress Nicholle Tom, who played Maggie Sheffield on &quot;The Nanny&quot;. He guest-starred with her on an episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; in 2008. They have one older sibling, Heather Tom, who played Tom&#x27;s sister on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and co-starred with him on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

When Tom was eight, his family moved from Chicago, Illinois to Seattle, Washington because of his father&#x27;s work. A year later, his mother brought all three children to Los Angeles for pilot season. They relocated there permanently, with Tom&#x27;s father staying behind in Seattle and his parents divorcing. His mother got a job as a speech therapist for the Pasadena school system, while the children pursued acting. Tom studied at the Young Actors Space and worked with acting teacher Diane Hardin.

==Career==
After appearing in print advertisements and television commercials, Tom made his film debut with an uncredited role in &quot;Plain Clothes&quot; in 1988. He then landed a regular role as Bart McCray on the NBC series &quot;Brand New Life&quot; (1989-1990). He made guest starring appearances on &quot;Get a Life&quot; and &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;. Tom was cast as Sponge in the pilot episode of the Nickelodeon series &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot;. 

Tom played Andy, a young boy suffering from psychosomatic paralysis, in the 1992 TV Movie &quot;Stepfather III&quot;. He played Darryl Knable in the film &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;, co-starring with John Ritter. Tom received Young Artist Award nominations for his roles in both films.

In 1993, Tom played Willi in the historical film &quot;Swing Kids&quot;, garnering another Young Artist Award nomination. He had recurring roles on &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; and &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. Tom appeared in the TV movies &quot;A Place to Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Summertime Switch&quot;.

Tom starred as Jacob McKay, a young boy who gets stranded in the Rocky Mountains, in the 1995 film &quot;Walking Thunder&quot;. He played a younger version of D.B. Sweeney&#x27;s character in the comedy-drama film &quot;Roommates&quot; and guest starred on &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;. 

He appeared as Whitey in the 1998 comedy-drama film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, co-starring with Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon. Tom also had a role in the NBC TV mini-series &quot;The 60s&quot;. He played David Cass in the TV movie &quot;Man of Miracles&quot; (also known as &quot;Holy Joe&quot;), co-starring again with John Ritter. In 1999, Tom had recurring roles on &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot; and &quot;Party of Five.&quot;

Tom played the role of Billy Abbott on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, from June 1999 to August 2002. He won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor for his role on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 2000. He was nominated again in the same category in 2001. He also won a Soap Opera Digest Award in 2000 for Outstanding Male Newcomer. He received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Lead Actor in 2001. 

In February 2004, it was announced that he would be joining the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Paul Cramer, replacing Brock Cuchna. His real-life sister, Heather Tom, played his half-sister, Kelly Cramer. He was involved in a crossover storyline with &quot;All My Children&quot;, making several appearances on that show. He took a temporary leave of absence from &quot;OLTL&quot; in July 2004 before a permanent departure was announced in September 2004. 

Tom played Jacob Sterling in the 2004 horror film &quot;The Hazing&quot;. He had a recurring role as Chip Diller on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2006 to 2007). In 2010, he played Daniel Whittaker in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;Love Begins&quot;. He also appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Pendejo (Idiot)&quot;. He had guest starring roles on &quot;&quot;, &quot;90210&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. 

It was announced in November 2013 that he would be reprising the role of Billy Abbott on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, replacing Billy Miller. Four months after his return, he was abruptly fired and replaced with Burgess Jenkins. Tom said he was replaced because he looked too young when paired with his love interest, Cady McClain.

Tom guest-starred in episodes of &quot;&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot; in 2015. He also played the role of Tobey in the film &quot;Chasing Yesterday&quot;. In 2019, Tom played Staff Sgt. Kuhn in the film &quot;D-Day: Battle of Omaha Beach&quot;.

<doc id="715940" wikidata="Q918054" url="?curid=715940" title="NBA Coach of the Year">
<text>The National Basketball Association&#x27;s Coach of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1962–63 NBA season. The winner receives the [[Red Auerbach]] Trophy, which is named in honor of the head coach who led the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships from 1956 to 1966. The winner is selected at the end of the regular season by a panel of sportswriters from the United States and Canada, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The person with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.

Since its inception, the award has been given to 40 different coaches. The most recent award winner is current Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault. Gregg Popovich, Don Nelson and Pat Riley have each won the award three times, while Hubie Brown, Mike Brown, Mike Budenholzer, Mike D&#x27;Antoni, Bill Fitch, Cotton Fitzsimmons, Gene Shue, and Tom Thibodeau have each won it twice. No coach has won consecutive Coach of the Year awards. Riley is the only coach to be named Coach of the Year with three franchises. Tom Heinsohn, Bill Sharman, and Lenny Wilkens are the only recipients to have been inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both player and coach. Johnny Kerr is the only person to win the award with a losing record (33–48 with the Chicago Bulls in ). Kerr was honored because he had guided the Bulls to the NBA Playoffs in their first season in the league. Doc Rivers is the only person to win the award despite his team not making the playoffs (41–41 with the Orlando Magic in ). Only five recipients also coached the team that won the championship the same season: Red Auerbach, Red Holzman, Bill Sharman, Phil Jackson, and Gregg Popovich. Popovich is the only NBA Coach of the Year recipient to win the championship in the same season twice, winning the NBA title with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003 and 2014. 2020 winner and former Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse is the only coach to receive this honor in both the NBA and the NBA G League, having received the G League award in 2011.

2015–16 recipient Steve Kerr only coached 39 of the 82 games in the season due to complications from offseason back surgery, though he received credit for all of the Golden State Warriors&#x27; 73 wins that season. Assistant coach Luke Walton served as interim head coach for the other 43 games for the Warriors, receiving one second-place vote and two third-place votes. Steve Kerr and Luke Walton both won NBA Coach of the Month during the 2015-16 season, Kerr in March and Walton in November. Kerr asked the league to award Walton with the wins accumulated during Kerr&#x27;s medical recovery time, but the NBA refused to do so because under league rules interim head coaches do not have win-loss records at all. Mike Brown became the first unanimous Coach of the Year recipient in NBA history in the 2022–23 season.

<doc id="715946" wikidata="Q5605123" url="?curid=715946" title="Green–Schwarz mechanism">
<text>The Green–Schwarz mechanism (sometimes called the Green–Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism) is the main discovery that started the first superstring revolution in superstring theory.

==Discovery==
In 1984, Michael Green and John H. Schwarz realized that the anomaly in type I string theory with the gauge group SO(32) cancels because of an extra &quot;classical&quot; contribution from a 2-form field. They realized that one of the necessary conditions for a superstring theory to make sense is that the dimension of the gauge group of type I string theory must be 496 and then demonstrated this to be so.

In the original calculation, gauge anomalies, mixed anomalies, and gravitational anomalies were expected to arise from a hexagon Feynman diagram. For the special choice of the gauge group SO(32) or E8 x E8, however, the anomaly factorizes and may be cancelled by a tree diagram. In string theory, this indeed occurs. The tree diagram describes the exchange of a virtual quantum of the B-field. It is somewhat counterintuitive to see that a tree diagram cancels a one-loop diagram, but in reality, both of these diagrams arise as one-loop diagrams in superstring theory in which the anomaly cancellation is more transparent.

As recounted in &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;&#x27;s TV version, in the second episode, &quot;The String&#x27;s the Thing&quot;, section &quot;Wrestling with String Theory&quot;, Green describes finding 496 on each side of the equals sign during a stormy night filled with lightning, and fondly recalls joking that &quot;the gods are trying to prevent us from completing this calculation&quot;. Green soon entitled some of his subsequent lectures &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;.

==Details==

Anomalies in quantum theory arise from one-loop diagrams, with a chiral fermion in the loop and gauge fields, Ricci tensors, or global symmetry currents as the external legs. These diagrams have the form of a triangle in 4 spacetime dimensions, which generalizes to a hexagon in &quot;D&quot; = 10, thus involving 6 external lines. The interesting anomaly in SUSY &quot;D&quot; = 10 gauge theory is the hexagon which has a particular linear combination of the two-form gauge field strength and Ricci tensor, formula_1, for the external lines.

Green and Schwarz realized that one can add a so-called Chern–Simons term to the classical action,
having the form formula_2, where the integral is over the 10 dimensions, formula_3 is the rank-two Kalb–Ramond field, and formula_4 is 
a gauge invariant combination of formula_5 (with space-time indices not contracted), which is precisely one of the factors appearing in the hexagon anomaly.
If the variation of formula_3 under the transformations of gauge field for formula_7 and under general coordinate transformations is appropriately specified, then 
the Green–Schwarz term formula_8, when combined with a trilinear vertex through exchange of a gauge boson, has precisely the right variation to cancel the hexagon anomaly.

<text>Salvor Hardin is a fictional character in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series by Isaac Asimov. Introduced in the 1942 short story &quot;Foundation&quot;, he is the first mayor of Terminus, the home planet of the Foundation. He defuses a potential political crisis with four nearby barbarian planets, while also securing their dependence on the Foundation. Hardin takes advantage of this power in &quot;Bridle and Saddle&quot; (1942) when one of the planets, Anacreon, declares war on the Foundation.

Hardin is voiced by Lee Montague in the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot;. A gender-swapped and expanded version of the character is portrayed by Leah Harvey in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation &quot;Foundation&quot;.

== Literature ==
Salvor Hardin appears in the short stories &quot;Foundation&quot;, published in the May 1942 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Bridle and Saddle&quot;, published in the June 1942 issue. They were renamed &quot;The Encyclopedists&quot; and &quot;The Mayors&quot;, paired with three other stories and published as &quot;Foundation&quot; in 1951.

=== Description ===
Josh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; described Hardin as &quot;a staggeringly brilliant politician&quot; and &quot;a lively, independent thinker who has a solid grasp on reality&quot;, in contrast with the Foundation&#x27;s encyclopedists, whom they characterize as &quot;pedantic academics with no grip on the real world&quot;. They wrote that though Hardin does not believe in the religious culture established on Anacreon, he does not &quot;think any less of the believers or wish them any harm&quot; and recognizes religion as &quot;the best way of doing some good at a time when science has become tainted with the Empire&#x27;s failure.&quot; He employs Foundation priests to bring new planets into this new empire, whereas future leaders like Hober Mallow use business deals to resolve crises and form alliances. Wimmer and Wilkins placed Hardin on their &quot;short list for Asimov&#x27;s best characters&quot;, and explained:
Wimmer and Wilkins wrote that Hardin and Limmar Ponyets, the main character of the story &quot;The Traders&quot;, &quot;let the bad guys accumulate all this power, and then ever so deftly turn it back against them&quot;, but described Ponyets&#x27;s blackmail of an ambitious politician as &quot;lame&quot; compared to &quot;the operatic scope of Hardin&#x27;s secret plan in &#x27;The Mayors&#x27;.&quot; They added:
=== &quot;Foundation&quot; ===
In &quot;Foundation&quot;, Salvor Hardin is the first mayor of Terminus City, the primary settlement on Terminus. The planet is the home of the Foundation, an organization dedicated to the predictive science of psychohistory, invented by famed mathematician and psychologist Hari Seldon. Hardin believes Terminus is in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire. Identifying the kingdom of Anacreon as the most powerful of the four, Hardin visits the others and convinces them that they must resist nuclear power from falling to Anacreon alone. The three issue a joint ultimatum that all be allowed to receive nuclear technology from Terminus City, ensuring that the Foundation is indispensable to all.

=== &quot;The Mayors&quot; ===
In &quot;The Mayors&quot;, Anacreon launches a direct military assault against Terminus using an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser. Hardin secretly installs a kill switch into the cruiser, causing the crew to mutiny. Maddened by this failure, Prince Regent Wienis of Anacreon orders Hardin&#x27;s execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. He then attempts, but fails, to kill Hardin himself.

== Adaptations ==

=== Radio ===
Hardin is voiced by Lee Montague in episode two &quot;The Mayors&quot; of the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation &quot;The Foundation Trilogy&quot;.

=== Television ===
A gender-swapped and expanded version of Hardin is portrayed by Leah Harvey in the 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation &quot;Foundation&quot;. Harvey&#x27;s casting was announced in December 2019. Hardin is the Warden and protector of Terminus, 35 years after Seldon&#x27;s trial.

==== Season 1 ====
In the 2021 episode &quot;The Mathematician&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, Warden Hardin is disturbed to find that the &quot;null field&quot; around Hari Seldon&#x27;s mysterious Vault, which repels all life and seemingly protects the Vault, has suddenly expanded. She is a second-generation colonist who possesses a unique resistance to the field. As ships approach from the planet Anacreon, a violation of Imperial sanctions, Hardin finds herself surrounded by an advance ground party of Anacreons. Hardin outwits the Anacreons and captures their leader, Grand Huntress Phara Keaen, in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot;, but Keaen manages to escape and disables Terminus City&#x27;s defenses from the inside in &quot;Upon Awakening&quot;.

In &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;, the Anacreons round up colonists with the skills necessary to repair and crew the &quot;Invictus&quot;, a long-lost Imperial warship that Keaen plans to use to attack the Empire. Hardin has a vision of Seldon&#x27;s death which reveals to her that Raych Foss killed Seldon on his own orders, and that the escape pod taken by Gaal Dornick had been intended for Raych. Hardin and her lover, the Thespin trader Hugo Crast, are captured by the Anacreons. They bring Hardin, Crast and the colonists aboard the &quot;Invictus&quot; in &quot;Mysteries and Martyrs&quot;, and after several casualties they manage to circumvent the security protocols and reach the bridge in &quot;The Missing Piece&quot;. As Hardin fights Keaen and Crast&#x27;s Thespin allies arrive, the &quot;Invictus&quot; jumps into the unknown.

The ship appears over Terminus in &quot;The First Crisis&quot;, and Hardin is reunited with Crast. The Vault&#x27;s null field has enveloped the entire planet, but Hardin solves its puzzle and the Vault becomes a portal. Hardin proposes they use &quot;Invictus&quot; to give all three worlds leverage against the Empire, and kills Keaen before she can destroy the Vault. Seldon emerges from the portal. In the season one finale episode &quot;The Leap&quot;, Seldon reveals that the true intent of the Foundation is to create a new civilization assisted by Anacreon and Thespis. Months later, Hardin learns that she is the biological daughter of Dornick and Foss, and realizes that her visions are their memories. She leaves Terminus in search of Dornick. Years later, Dornick lands on her home planet, the ocean world Synnax, and finds another pod underwater, containing Hardin in stasis. Awakened, Hardin tells Dornick she is her daughter, and gives her Seldon&#x27;s Prime Radiant device.

==== Season 2 ====
In season two, Hardin and Dornick determine that Seldon&#x27;s plan is off course, and he explains that reviving the interrupted Second Foundation is the solution. Dornick has a vision of Hardin&#x27;s death at the hands of a mysterious telepath, the Mule, 150 years in the future. In &quot;The Sighted and the Seen&quot;, Hardin, Dornick and Seldon arrive at Ignis, where Hardin is seemingly reunited with Crast. He is revealed to be an illusion created by a Mentalic, or telepath, and the trio are taken before the leader of the Mentalic community, Tellem Bond. Bond has established a refuge to save Mentalics from persecution throughout the galaxy. She welcomes Dornick and her precognitive talents in &quot;Why the Gods Made Wine&quot;, but is resistant to Seldon and the idea of the Second Foundation. Seldon is suspicious of Bond, and appears to leave the planet, but in actuality he has been captured and slowly drowned at Bond&#x27;s command.

In &quot;A Necessary Death&quot;, Hardin remains suspicious of the Mentalics&#x27; motives and Seldon&#x27;s sudden departure. She discovers his drowned body, but is caught by Bond and rendered unconscious, floating face-down in a pool of seawater. In &quot;The Last Empress&quot;, Bond prepares to transfer her consciousness from her dying body into a captive Dornick, but Hardin appears and saves Dornick in &quot;Long Ago, Not Far Away&quot; Seldon is also alive, and kills Bond. Another Mentalic controlled by Bond&#x27;s psyche attempts to kill Dornick in &quot;Creation Myths&quot;, but Hardin dies taking the bullet meant for Dornick. The conflict with Dornick&#x27;s previous vision of Hardin&#x27;s death illustrates to Seldon and Dornick that the future can be changed after all. They decide to enter cryosleep, and awaken periodically to keep the Second Foundation on track.

Goyer said that Hardin&#x27;s death was originally planned for the end of season three, but while writing season two it was decided that killing the character earlier would be a stronger creative choice that would move the story forward. He said that though he loved the character, &quot;I thought it would be surprising, and I thought her death would be meaningful because one of the themes that we&#x27;ve been exploring in the show, it seems like psychohistory predicting a probable future because conditions can change, you know? That the Empire can fall on this date or the Empire can fall on that date. So it&#x27;s not a deterministic future, it&#x27;s a probable future.&quot;

<text>An old soldiers&#x27; home is a military veterans&#x27; retirement home, nursing home, or hospital, or sometimes an institution for the care of the widows and orphans of a nation&#x27;s soldiers, sailors, and marines, etc.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom the Royal Hospital Chelsea was established by King Charles II in 1682 as a retreat for veterans. The provision of a hostel rather than the payment of pensions was inspired by in Paris.

The Royal Hospital Chelsea, often called simply Chelsea Hospital, is a retirement home and nursing home for some 300 veterans of the British Army. It is a 66-acre site located on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, London. It is an independent charity and relies partly upon donations to cover day-to-day running costs to provide care and accommodation for veterans.

Any man or woman who is over the age of 65 and served as a regular soldier may apply to become a Chelsea Pensioner (i.e. a resident), on the basis they have found themselves in a time of need and are &quot;of good character&quot;. They must not, however, have any dependent spouse or family and former Officers must have served at least 12 years in the ranks before receiving a commission.

The site for the Royal Hospital was an area of Chelsea which held an incomplete building &quot;Chelsey College&quot;, a theological college James I founded in 1609. The Royal Hospital opened its doors to the Chelsea Pensioners in 1692 for &quot;the relief and succour&quot; of veterans. Some of the first soldiers admitted included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor.

The hospital maintains a &#x27;military-based culture which puts a premium on comradeship&#x27;. The in-pensioners are formed into three companies, each headed by a Captain of Invalids (an ex-Army officer responsible for the &#x27;day to day welfare, management and administration&#x27; of the pensioners under his charge).

There is also a Secretary who traditionally was responsible for paying the Army pensions, but today they look after the annual budget, staff, buildings and grounds. Further senior staff include the Physician &amp; Surgeon, the Matron, the Quartermaster, the Chaplain and the Adjutant.

A Board of Commissioners has governed the Royal Hospital since 1702. The ex-officio chairman of the board is HM Paymaster General (whose predecessor Sir Stephen Fox was instrumental in founding the Hospital in the seventeenth century). The purpose of the Board is &#x27;to guide the development of The Royal Hospital, ensuring the care and well-being of the Chelsea Pensioners who live there and safeguarding the historic buildings and grounds, which it owns in trust&#x27;.

Royal Hospital is also a ward of the Kensington and Chelsea Council. The population at the 2011 Census was 7,252.

Greenwich Hospital was a permanent home for retired sailors of the Royal Navy, which operated from 1692 to 1869. Its buildings were later used by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich and the University of Greenwich, and are now known as the Old Royal Naval College. The word &quot;hospital&quot; was used in its original sense of a place providing hospitality for those in need of it, and did not refer to medical care, although the buildings included an infirmary which, after Greenwich Hospital closed, operated as Dreadnought Seaman&#x27;s Hospital until 1986. The foundation which operated the hospital still exists, for the benefit of former Royal Navy personnel and their dependents. It now provides sheltered housing on other sites.

The hospital was created as the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich on the instructions of Queen Mary II, who had been inspired by the sight of wounded sailors returning from the Battle of La Hogue in 1692. She ordered the King Charles wing of the palace—originally designed by architect John Webb for King Charles II in 1664—to be remodelled as a naval hospital to provide a counterpart for the Chelsea Hospital for soldiers. Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor gave their services free of charge as architects of the new Royal Hospital. Sir John Vanbrugh succeeded Wren as architect, completing the complex to Wren&#x27;s original plans.

Construction was financed through an endowment, financed through the transfer of £19,500 in fines paid by merchants convicted of smuggling in 1695, a public fundraising appeal which brought in £9,000, and a £2,000 annual contribution from Treasury. In 1705 an additional £6,472 was paid into the fund, comprising the liquidated value of estates belonging to the recently hanged pirate Captain William Kidd.

The first of the principal buildings constructed was the King Charles Court (the oldest part dating back to the restoration), completed in 1705. The first governor, Sir William Gifford, took up office in 1708.

==United States==
===Federal homes===
The first national veterans&#x27; home in the United States was the United States Naval Home approved in 1811 but not opened until 1834 in the Philadelphia Naval Yard. The Naval Home was moved to Gulfport, Mississippi in 1976. It was subsequently opened to veterans of other services and is now the Gulfport Campus of the Armed Forces Retirement Home.

The first Army national old soldiers&#x27; home in the U.S. was established in Washington, D.C., in 1851. General Winfield Scott founded the Soldier&#x27;s Home in Washington, D.C., and another (since fallen into disuse) in Harrodsburg, Kentucky with about $118,000 in leftover proceeds of assessments on occupied Mexican towns and the sale of captured tobacco in the Mexican–American War.

The Old Soldier&#x27;s Home, now known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home, was the site of President Lincoln&#x27;s Cottage, a 34-room Gothic Revival cottage, which served as Lincoln&#x27;s summer home during the American Civil War. It is adjacent to National Cemetery, the first federal military cemetery in the United States. The Home has remained in continuous use since its establishment. It is located on a wooded campus overlooking the U.S. Capitol in the heart of Washington, D.C., three miles from the White House, and continues to serve as a retirement home for U.S. enlisted men and women. Both the Washington, D.C., and Gulfport soldiers&#x27; and sailors&#x27; homes are funded through a small monthly contribution from the pay of members of the U.S. Armed Services.

Following the American Civil War the federal government increased the number of National Military Homes, and took over a few formerly state-run old soldiers&#x27; homes. By 1933 there were 17 federally managed veterans homes. All except the first two of these homes were eventually combined with other federal government agencies to become part of what is now called the Veterans Administration, or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs established in 1930.

===State homes===
Caring for the disabled and elderly, and the widows and orphans of men who died in the war became a concern even before the Civil War ended. For example, in 1864 Fitch&#x27;s Home for Soldiers and Their Orphans was opened with private donations in Connecticut. Various female benevolent societies pushed for the creation of a long-term care federal or state soldier home system at the end of the war. Large veterans organizations like the Grand Army of the Republic and United Confederate Veterans eventually also worked for the creation of federal and state homes to care for disabled or elderly veterans. In a few cases veterans organizations on their own raised the money to buy property and build veterans homes. Most of these were quickly turned over to the state government to fund and manage. The majority of state legislatures established veterans homes paid for by state monies from the start. 43 states managed 55 functioning state veterans homes before 1933. Fourteen of those states also had a federal veterans home open at the same time as their state veterans home.

Eleven states had two or more state veterans homes in operation at the same time (two of which also had a federal home). Some states simply had several homes at once. A few states admitted veterans&#x27; widows, and a few other states established separate homes for the widows and orphans. A few states had separate Union and Confederate old soldiers&#x27; homes. The first of 16 Confederate homes was opened in 1881 in Georgetown, Kentucky. Confederate soldiers&#x27; homes were supported entirely by subscribers or by the states, with no funds from the federal government against which the Confederates had fought.

A few state-run old soldiers&#x27; homes were eventually folded into the federal veterans home system. As their last few Civil War veterans were dying in the 1930s, some states chose to close their old soldiers&#x27; homes, and other states began admission of veterans from more recent wars. Several of these state old soldiers&#x27; homes have been modernized and stopped serving veterans.

===City homes===
Soldier homes in major cities were among the earliest, usually starting more as hotels for men passing through town, but increasingly taking on disabled servicemen. These were usually operated as paying businesses rather than being fully funded by the government. Philadelphia had two soldiers&#x27; homes which were associated with nearby saloons and got their start as a part of the refreshment and lodging business. Women activists also helped establish disabled soldiers&#x27; homes in Boston, Chicago, and Milwaukee, or in conjunction with the U.S. Sanitary Commission in 25 other cities. The Boston home closed in 1869, the Philadelphia homes closed in 1872, the Chicago Soldiers&#x27; Home lasted until 1877, and Milwaukee turned into a federal home.

===US Sanitary Commission homes, lodges, and rest===
During the Civil War, the US Sanitary Commission provided Union servicemen &quot;[t]emporary aid and protection,—food, lodging, care, etc.,—for soldiers in transitn[sic], chiefly the discharged, disabled, and furloughed.&quot; By 1865 the Commission operated 18 &quot;soldiers&#x27; homes,&quot; 11 &quot;lodges,&quot; and one &quot;rest&quot; in 15 states north and south (for a list see Commission bulletin, 3:1279). Most of their homes were war-time facilities and were closed at war&#x27;s end. They are not included in the following list.

<text>Burgundy wine ( or &quot;&quot;) is made in the Burgundy region of eastern France, in the valleys and slopes west of the Saône, a tributary of the Rhône. The most famous wines produced here, and those commonly referred to as &quot;Burgundies&quot;, are dry red wines made from pinot noir grapes and white wines made from chardonnay grapes.

Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties, such as gamay and aligoté, respectively. Small amounts of rosé and sparkling wines are also produced in the region. Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and gamay-dominated Beaujolais are recognised as part of the Burgundy wine region, but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as &quot;Burgundy wines&quot;.

Burgundy has a higher number of &#x27; (AOCs) than any other French region, and is often seen as the most&#x27;-conscious of the French wine regions. The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated &#x27; vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations. The practice of delineating vineyards by their&#x27; in Burgundy goes back to medieval times, when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry. The historical importance of the Burgundy wine region and its unique &quot;climats&quot; system led to sites in the region being inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Climats, terroirs of Burgundy site.

==Geography and climate==

The Burgundy region runs from Auxerre in the north to Mâcon in the south, or to Lyon if the Beaujolais area is included as part of Burgundy. Chablis, a white wine made from Chardonnay grapes, is produced in the area around Auxerre. Other smaller appellations near Chablis include Irancy, which produces red wines and Saint-Bris, which produces white wines from Sauvignon blanc.

There are 100 appellations in Burgundy and these are classified into four quality categories. These are Bourgogne, village, premier cru and grand cru. Eighty-five miles southeast of Chablis is the Côte d&#x27;Or, where Burgundy&#x27;s most famous and most expensive wines originate, and where all &quot;Grand Cru&quot; vineyards of Burgundy (except for chablis grand cru) are situated. The Côte d&#x27;Or itself is split into two parts: the Côte de Nuits which starts just south of Dijon and runs till Corgoloin, a few kilometers south of the town of Nuits-Saint-Georges, and the Côte de Beaune which starts at Ladoix and ends at Dezize-les-Maranges. The wine-growing part of this area in the heart of Burgundy is just long, and in most places less than wide. The area is made up of tiny villages surrounded by a combination of flat and sloped vineyards on the eastern side of a hilly region, providing some rain and weather shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. The best wines - from &quot;grand cru&quot; vineyards - of this region are usually grown from the middle and higher part of the slopes, where the vineyards have the most exposure to sunshine and the best drainage, while the &quot;premier cru&quot; come from a little less favourably exposed slopes. The relatively ordinary &quot;village&quot; wines are produced from the flat territory nearer the villages. The Côte de Nuits contains 24 out of the 25 red &quot;grand cru&quot; appellations in Burgundy, while all but one of the region&#x27;s white &quot;Grand Cru&quot; wines are in the Côte de Beaune (the exception being Musigny blanc). This is explained by the presence of different soils, which favour pinot noir and chardonnay, respectively.

Further south is the Côte Chalonnaise, where again a mix of mostly red and white wines are produced, although the appellations found here such as Mercurey, Rully and Givry are less well-known than their counterparts in the Côte d&#x27;Or.

Below the Côte Chalonnaise is the Mâconnais region, known for producing large quantities of easy-drinking and more affordable white wine. Further south again is the Beaujolais region, famous for fruity red wines made from Gamay grapes.

Burgundy&#x27;s terrain is continental climate characterized by cold winters and hot summers. The weather is unpredictable, with rains, hail, and frost all possible around harvest time. Such a climate results in vintages from Burgundy varying considerably.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence establishes viticulture in Burgundy as early as the second century AD, although the Celts may have been growing vines in the region previous to the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC. Greek traders, for whom viticulture had been practiced since the late Neolithic period, had founded Massalía in about 600 BC, and traded extensively up the Rhône valley, where the Romans first arrived in the second century BC. The earliest recorded praise of the wines of Burgundy was written in 591 by Gregory of Tours, who compared it to the Roman wine Falernian.

Monks and monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church have had an important influence on the history of Burgundy wine. The first known donation of a vineyard to the Church was by King Guntram in 587, but the influence of the Church became important in Charlemagne&#x27;s era. The Benedictines, through their Abbey of Cluny founded in 910, became the first truly big Burgundy vineyard owner over the following centuries. Another order which exerted influence was the Cistercians, founded in 1098 and named after Cîteaux, their first monastery, situated in Burgundy. The Cistercians created Burgundy&#x27;s largest wall-surrounded vineyard, the Clos de Vougeot, in 1336. More importantly, the Cistercians, extensive vineyard owners as they were, were the first to notice that different vineyard plots gave consistently different wines. They therefore laid the earliest foundation for the naming of Burgundy &quot;crus&quot; and the region&#x27;s &quot;terroir&quot; thinking.

Since Burgundy is land-locked, very little of its wine left the region in medieval times, when wine was transported in barrels, meaning that waterways provided the only practical means of long-range transportation. The only part of Burgundy which could reach Paris in a practical way was the area around Auxerre by means of the Yonne. This area includes Chablis, but had much more extensive vineyards until the 19th century. These were the wines referred to as &quot;vin de Bourgogne&quot; in early texts. The wines from Côte d&#x27;Or would then be called &quot;(vin de) Beaune&quot;. These wines first became famous in the 14th century, during the Babylonian Captivity of the Papacy in Avignon, which was reachable by Saône and Rhône after some overland transport. In the extravagance of the papal court, &quot;Beaune&quot; was generally seen as the finest wine, and better than anything available in Rome at that time.

The status of Burgundy wines continued in the court of the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of Burgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and export of non-Burgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from Northern European markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry. It was during this era that the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made. Pinot noir was first mentioned in 1370 under the name Noirien, but it was believed to have been cultivated earlier than that, since no other grape variety associated with medieval Burgundy is believed to have been able to produce red wines of a quality able to impress the papal court. On 6 August 1395, Duke Philip the Bold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of Burgundy wines. The duke declared the &quot;vile and disloyal Gamay&quot;—which was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th century, as it is today—unfit for human consumption and banned the use of organic fertilizer (manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality. High-quality white Burgundy wines of this era were probably made from Fromenteau, which is known as a quality grape in northeastern France in this time. Fromenteau is probably the same variety as today&#x27;s Pinot gris. Chardonnay is a much later addition to Burgundy&#x27;s vineyards.

In the 18th century, the quality of roads in France became progressively better, which facilitated commerce in Burgundy wines. The first &quot;négociant&quot; houses of the region were established in the 1720s and 1730s. In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market, to which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era, since Champagne was then primarily a producer of pale red still wines rather than of sparkling wines. A major work on Burgundy wines written by Claude Arnoux in 1728 deals with the famous red wines of Côte de Nuits and the Œil-de-Perdrix pink wines of Volnay, but only briefly mentions white wines.

After Burgundy became incorporated in the Kingdom of France, and the power of the Church decreased, many vineyards which had been in the Church&#x27;s hands were sold to the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; from the 17th century. After the French Revolution of 1789, the Church&#x27;s remaining vineyards were broken up and from 1791 sold off. The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued subdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two of vines. This led to the emergence of &quot;négociants&quot; who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a single wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified by the dozen-plus &quot;Gros&quot; family &quot;domaines&quot;.

The awareness of the difference of quality and style of Burgundy wines produced from different vineyards goes back to medieval times, with certain &quot;climats&quot; being more highly rated than others. An early author on this aspect of Burgundy wines was Denis Morelot with his &quot;La Vigne et le Vin en Côte d&#x27;Or&quot; from 1831. In 1855, the same year as the famous Bordeaux Wine Official Classification was launched, Dr. Jules Lavalle published an influential book, &quot;Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne de Grands Vins de la Côte-d&#x27;Or&quot;, which included an unofficial classification of the Burgundy vineyards in five classes and which built on Morelot&#x27;s book. In decreasing order, Lavalle&#x27;s five classes were &quot;hors ligne&quot;, &quot;tête de cuvée&quot;, &quot;1ère cuvée&quot;, &quot;2me cuvée&quot; and &quot;3me cuvée&quot;. Lavalle&#x27;s classification was formalized in modified form by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture in 1861, and then consisted of three classes. Most of the &quot;first class&quot; vineyards of the 1861 classification were made into &quot;Grand Cru&quot; &quot;appellations d&#x27;origine contrôlées&quot; when the national AOC legislation was implemented in 1936.

Burgundy wine has experienced much change over the past 75 years. Economic depression during the 1930s was followed by the devastation caused by World War II. After the War, the &quot;vignerons&quot; returned home to their unkempt vineyards. The soils and vines had suffered and were sorely in need of nurturing. The growers began to fertilize, bringing their vineyards back to health. Those who could afford it added potassium, a mineral fertilizer that contributes to vigorous growth. By the mid-1950s, the soils were balanced, yields were reasonably low and the vineyards produced some of the most stunning wines in the 20th century.

For the next 30 years, they followed the advice of renowned viticultural experts, who advised them to keep spraying their vineyards with chemical fertilizers, including potassium. While a certain amount of potassium is natural in the soil and beneficial for healthy growth, too much is harmful because it leads to low acidity levels, which adversely affect the quality of the wine.

As the concentration of chemicals in the soil increased, so did the yields. In the past 30 years, yields have risen by two-thirds in the &quot;appellations contrôlées&quot; vineyards of the Côte d&#x27;Or, from 29 hectoliters per hectare (hl/ha) (yearly average from 1951 to 1960) to almost 48 hl/ha (1982–91), according to a study by the Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine. With higher yields came wines of less flavor and concentration. Within 30 years, the soils had been significantly depleted of their natural nutrients.

The period between 1985 and 1995 was a turning point in Burgundy. During this time, many Burgundian &quot;&quot; renewed efforts in the vineyards and gradually set a new course in winemaking, producing deeper, more complex wines. Today, the Burgundy wine industry is reaping the rewards of those efforts.

== Wine characteristics and classification ==

Burgundy is in some ways the most &quot;terroir&quot;-oriented region in France; immense attention is paid to the area of origin, and in which of the region&#x27;s 400 types of soil a wine&#x27;s grapes are grown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are producer-driven and awarded to individual &quot;chateaux&quot;, Burgundy classifications are geographically focused. A specific vineyard or region will bear a given classification, regardless of the wine&#x27;s producer. This focus is reflected on the wine&#x27;s labels, where appellations are most prominent and producers&#x27; names often appear at the bottom in much smaller text.

The main levels in the Burgundy classifications, in descending order of quality, are: &quot;Grand crus, Premier crus&quot;, village appellations, and finally regional appellations:
* &quot;Grand Cru&quot; wines are produced by a small number of the best vineyard sites in the Côte d&#x27;Or region, as strictly defined by the AOC laws. These Cru wines make up 2% of the production at 35 hl/ha, and are generally produced in a style meant for cellaring, and typically need to be aged a minimum of five to seven years. The best examples can be kept for more than 15 years. &quot;Grand Cru&quot; wines will only list the name of the vineyard as the appellation - such as Corton or Montrachet - on the wine label, plus the &quot;Grand Cru&quot; term, but not the village name. Several &quot;Grand Cru&quot; vineyards have compound names (double-barrelled names), mostly due to adding a more famous vineyard which they neighbor, as in Charmes-Chambertin (adding Chambertin to &quot;Charmes&quot;) or Romanée-Saint-Vivant (adding La Romanée to &quot;Saint-Vivant&quot;; these no longer quite neighbor), though other compound names such as Corton-Charlemagne have idiosyncratic histories. There are two triple names of this form: Bienvenues-Bâtard-Montrachet and Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet, corresponding to vineyards that neighbor Bâtard-Montrachet, which neighbors Montrachet. Compound names using a more famous vineyard are sometimes referred to as &quot;satellites&quot; of the more famous one.
* &quot;Premier Cru&quot; wines are produced from specific vineyard sites that are still considered to be of high quality, but not as well regarded as the &quot;Grand Cru&quot; sites. &quot;Premier Cru&quot; wines make up 12% of production at 45 hl/ha. These wines often should be aged three to five years, and again the best wines can keep for much longer. &quot;Premier Cru&quot; wines are labelled with the name of the village of origin, the &quot;Premier Cru&quot; status, and usually the vineyard name, for example, &quot;Volnay 1er Cru Les Caillerets&quot;. Some &quot;Premier Cru&quot; wines are produced from several &quot;Premier Cru&quot; vineyards in the same village, and do not carry the name of an individual vineyard. Blending premier crus is more common in Morey-Saint-Denis than other villages.
* Village appellation wines are produced from a blend of wines from supposedly lesser vineyard sites within the boundaries of one of 42 villages, or from one individual but unclassified vineyard. Wines from each different village are considered to have their own specific qualities and characteristics, and not all Burgundy communes have a village appellation. Village wines make up 36% of production at 50 hl/ha. These wines can be consumed two to four years after the release date, although again some examples will keep for longer. Village wines will show the village name on the wine label, such as &quot;Pommard&quot;, and sometimes - if applicable - the name of the single vineyard or &quot;climat&quot; where it was sourced. Several villages in Burgundy have appended the names of their most famous &quot;Grand Cru&quot; vineyards to the original village name, for marketing reasons, resulting in double-barrelled names, starting with &quot;Gevrey-Chambertin&quot; in 1847 and ending with &quot;Morey-Saint-Denis&quot; in 1927.
* Regional appellation wines are wines which are allowed to be produced over the entire region, or over an area significantly larger than that of an individual village. At the village, &quot;Premier Cru&quot; and &quot;Grand Cru&quot; levels, only red and white wines are found, but some of the regional appellations also allow the production of rosé and sparkling wines, as well as wines dominated by grape varieties other than Pinot noir or Chardonnay. These appellations can be divided into three groups:
:* AOC Bourgogne, the standard or &quot;generic&quot; appellation for red or white wines made anywhere throughout the region, and represent simpler wines which are still similar to the village. These wines may be produced at 55 hl/ha. These wines are typically intended for immediate consumption, within three years after the vintage date.
:* Subregional (&quot;sous-régional&quot;) appellations cover a part of Burgundy larger than a village. Examples are Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Beaune, Bourgogne Hautes-Côtes de Nuits and Mâcon-Villages. Typically, those communes which do not have a village appellation will have access to at least one subregional appellation. This level is sometimes described as intermediate between AOC Bourgogne and the village level.
:* Wines of specific styles or other grape varieties include white &quot;Bourgogne Aligoté&quot; (which is primarily made with the Aligoté grape), red &quot;Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains&quot; (which can contain up to two-thirds Gamay) and sparkling &quot;Crémant de Bourgogne&quot;.

Chablis wines are labeled using a similar hierarchy of &quot;Grand Cru, Premier Cru&quot;, and Village wines, plus &quot;Petit&quot; Chablis as a level below Village Chablis. Wines from Beaujolais are treated still differently.

In general, producers are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC if they wish to do so. Thus, a wine from a &quot;Grand Cru&quot; vineyard may be sold as a &quot;Premier Cru&quot; from that vineyard&#x27;s village, a &quot;Premier Cru&quot; wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold at a lower price, so this is only practiced when something is to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a &quot;Grand&quot; Cru wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a &quot;Premier Cru&quot; at a lower price. Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold.

In total, around 150 separate AOCs are used in Burgundy, including those of Chablis and Beaujolais. While an impressive number, it does not include the several hundred named vineyards (&quot;lieux-dits&quot;) at the Village and &quot;Premier Cru&quot; level, which may be displayed on the label, since at these levels, only one set of appellation rules is available per village. The total number of vineyard-differentiated AOCs that may be displayed is well in excess of 500.

==Production==
In 2003, the Burgundy vineyards (including Chablis but excluding Beaujolais) covered a total of . Côte d&#x27;Or as a whole, including Hautes Côtes de Beaune and Hautes Côtes de Nuits, covered , of which the heartland of Côte de Nuits covered and Côte de Beaune .

In 2000, Burgundy had a total of 3,200 wine &quot;domaines&quot; (compared to 50 in the early 19th century), of which 520 were in the department of Yonne, 1,100 in Côte-d&#x27;Or and 1,570 in Saône-et-Loir. Generally, the small growers sell their grapes to larger producers, merchants called &quot;négociants&quot;, who blend and bottle the wine. The roughly 115 &quot;négociants&quot; who produce the majority of the wine only control around 8% of the area. Individual growers have around 67% of the area, but produce and market only around 25% of the wine. Some small wineries produce only 100–200 cases/year, while many producers make a few thousand cases/year.

Grower/producer-made wines can be identified by the terms &quot;Mis en bouteille au domaine&quot;, &quot;Mis au domaine&quot;, or &quot;Mis en bouteille à la propriété&quot;. The largest producer is Maison Louis Latour in Beaune with 350,000 cases/year. The &quot;négociants&quot; may use the term &quot;Mis en bouteille dans nos caves&quot; (bottled in our cellars), but are not entitled to use the estate-bottled designation of the grower/producers. Most &quot;négociants&quot; tend to use the term &quot;Mis en bouteille par...&quot; (bottled by...).

==Grape varieties==

Of the white grapes, Chardonnay is the most common. Another grape found in the region, Aligoté, tends to produce cheaper wines which are higher in acidity. Aligoté from Burgundy is the wine traditionally used for the Kir drink, where it is mixed with black currant liqueur. Sauvignon blanc is also grown in the Saint Bris appellation. Chablis, Mâcon wines and the Côte d&#x27;Or whites are mostly produced from 100% Chardonnay grapes.

Of the red grapes, the majority of production in the Côte d&#x27;Or is focused on the Pinot noir grape, while the Gamay grape is grown in Beaujolais. In the Côte de Nuits region, 90% of the production is red grapes.

Rules for the red Burgundy appellations, from regional to &quot;Grand Cru&quot; level, generally allow up to 15% of the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris to be blended in, but this is not widely practised today.

==Reputation and appreciation==
Burgundy is home to some of the most expensive wines in the world, including those of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Domaine Leroy, Henri Jayer, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Armand Rousseau.

Its renown goes back many centuries; in 1522 Erasmus wrote: &quot;O happy Burgundy which merits being called the mother of men since she furnishes from her mammaries such a good milk&quot; This was echoed by Shakespeare, who refers in &quot;King Lear&quot; to &quot;the vines of France and milk of Burgundy&quot;.

British wine critic Jancis Robinson has stated that &quot;price is an extremely unreliable guide&quot; and &quot;what a wine sells for often has more to do with advertising hype and marketing decisions than the quality contained in the bottle&quot;. While &quot;Grand Crus&quot; often command steep prices, village level wines from top producers can be found at lower price points.

In 2010, the Burgundy region experienced a notable increase in internet coverage thanks to official efforts like the online broadcast of the famous &quot;Hospices de Beaune&quot;, as well as the efforts of independent wine aficionados, such as &quot;Bourgogne Live&quot;. Some burgundies are also increasingly valued as investment wines.

Fans of Burgundy wine have been organizing events celebrating its virtues for decades. The most famous of these is &quot;La Paulée de Meursault&quot;.

<text>Mary Stuart (born Mary Stuart Houchins; July 4, 1926 – February 28, 2002) was an American actress, guitarist, singer, and songwriter.

A former silver screen starlet, she was best known for her starring role as Joanne on the CBS/NBC soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, which she played for 35 years without interruption (1951–86).

After her divorce from her first husband, with whom she raised two children, she began a side career as a guitarist and a singer-songwriter, first singing on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and then releasing her own album in 1973.

At the time of her death, she had played the role of Meta Bauer on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; for six years. For her work in daytime drama, she was given the Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy.

==Early years==
Stuart was born Mary Stuart Houchins in Miami, Florida, on July 4, 1926, to Guy M. and Mary (née Stuart) Houchins. She grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Stuart started performing in her youth, and at the age of 9 she was selected by Count Basie Orchestra to perform with them at two of their shows. Her eventual stage name was her mother&#x27;s maiden name.

Stuart graduated from Tulsa Central High School and attended the University of Tulsa, where she majored in speech and drama, before embarking on her professional career. She was a member of Delta Delta sorority at the university. She worked briefly for the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; newspaper and worked with the Tulsa Little Theater.

She left home at age 17 for New York City. Upon arriving in New York she worked as a model and nightclub photographer at the Roosevelt Hotel.

While working at the hotel, Stuart met producer Joe Pasternak. After a screen test, Pasternak told Stuart &quot;you can&#x27;t sing, you can&#x27;t walk, but there is something that you have. Let&#x27;s figure out what it is.&quot; She signed a seven-year contract with MGM in 1946.

== &quot;Television Career and Search for Tomorrow&quot; ==
CBS offered Stuart a role in their new soap opera, &quot;The First Hundred Years.&quot; 

In 1951, Stuart was cast as housewife Joanne Gardner in &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. Stuart was the first actress to have her real life pregnancy written into the show, and was filmed at the hospital after giving birth to her son in 1956.

In 1953 she was named Favorite Daytime TV Serial Actress by &quot;Radio-TV Mirror&quot; magazine for her role in &quot;Search for Tomorrow.&quot;

For her performance, Stuart was the first soap opera actress to be nominated for an Emmy in 1962, before the creation of the Daytime Emmy Awards, and was nominated at the 1st Daytime Emmy Awards in 1974, but lost to Elizabeth Hubbard. Stuart later received two additional nominations at the Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1976 and 1977. In 1985, she earned a Lifetime Achievement Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.

&quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; was initially cancelled in 1982 by CBS, and was picked up by NBC, until it was canceled again in 1986 due to poor ratings and low viewership.

At the time of its second cancellation, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; ran for thirty-five years. At the time of its final cancelation it was the longest-running soap opera on television. Stuart was the only cast member to last the entire duration of the show.

== Film and musical career ==

===Film===
After her screentest with Joe Pasternak, Stuart began working in Hollywood. Her roles were usually small, but sometimes with leading actors of the time, including Ronald Reagan in The Girl from Jones Beach, Errol Flynn in &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot;, Clark Gable in &quot;The Hucksters&quot;, Esther Williams in &quot;This Time for Keeps&quot; and Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in &quot;The Big Street&quot;.

Stuart said about her work in films, &quot;When the elevator doors opened and a girl said, &#x27;Going up,&#x27; that was me. In the scenes where the secretary said, &#x27;Mr. Smith will see you now,&#x27; that was me.&quot; She also had roles in B Western films. After four years in Hollywood, she returned to New York City.

===Music===
In 1956, Stuart recorded &quot;Joanne Sings,&quot; an album of songs for children from the perspective of her &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; character. Stuart and Percy Faith collaborated on the album.

Stuart&#x27;s musical ability was put to use on &quot;Search for Tomorrow,&quot; with her character often singing, and Stuart herself writing songs occasionally for the show. Stuart also sang and played guitar on Christmas episodes, including, but not limited to, one notable Christmas in which Stuart sang &quot;Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella&quot; with actresses Ann Williams and Melissa Murphy, who played her sister and daughter at that time.

Stuart collaborated with Michel Legrand in 1973 for her self-titled album &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;. Stuart performed at her first public concert on January 8, 1974, at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina.

== Later career ==
Executive producer Paul Rauch offered her the role of the crooked Judge Webber on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; which she played in 1988, then settled into retirement, having worked nearly 40 years. She wrote a short story that was published in a magazine, which was eventually made into a CBS movie of the week.

Stuart started the New York Chapter of SAG-AFTRA Foundation Book PALS, which stood for Performing Artists for Literacy in Schools. The promoted childhood literacy by using performing artists in the classroom. Stuart frequently read to schoolchildren, and started six reading clubs in New York schools.

In 1996, she came out of retirement and accepted the role of Meta Bauer, Ed&#x27;s aunt who became a confidante of his daughter, Michelle, on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a part which had been played earlier by Ellen Demming.

==Personal life==
Stuart married Lester, a painter and set designer and one of the resident set designers for Oliver Rea, one of the founders of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. They later divorced.

Stuart married Richard Krolik in August 1951. Richard was a captain in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, and worked for Time Inc.Krolik produced the television version of &quot;The March of Time.&quot; She gave birth to their daughter, Cynthia in 1955, and their son Jeffrey in 1956.

In her 1980 book &quot;Both of Me&quot;, Stuart details the struggles encountered as a working mother and actress, and issues within her marriage to Krolik. In the 1960s, Stuart wrote on her struggles with mental health medicating by drinking &quot;two Martinis&quot; and taking &quot;two five-milligram tranquilizers&quot; daily.

Stuart wrote on her marriage to Krolik, his frequent disinterest in her work, coldness towards her interests, and frequent belittling. One such incident was a book she wrote and sent to a publisher. After showing him the manuscript, Krolik responded: &quot;Hey, you wrote a book and you never read one.&quot; Stuart wrote that this incident spurred a moment of suicidal ideation, writing &quot;I was treading water at the bottom of a well, and I needed help.&quot; Shortly after she began seeing a therapist. She and Krolik divorced in 1966.

While Jeffrey Krolik kept his birth name, Cynthia changed hers to Cynthia Stuart. Cynthia graduated from the North Carolina School of the Arts and became a journalist writing for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; She also followed in her mother&#x27;s footsteps as an actress for a time. Cynthia is now COO of the Supportive Housing Network of New York.

Jeffrey graduated from Dartmouth College and became a regional sales director for HBO. He was later appointed general manager for Fox Sports Net Bay Area.
 Both of Stuart&#x27;s children were raised and married in the Presbyterian Church.

Her third husband, Wolfgang Neumann, was an architect.

==Death==
When she died at her home in 2002 following a stroke, it was revealed that Stuart was also suffering from gastric cancer and bone cancer. She had previously undergone an endoscopy and an operation to remove a tumor in her stomach in 1999. Stuart had battled breast cancer earlier in her life. She was survived by her widower (Wolfgang Neumann), her two children and two grandchildren.

<doc id="715985" wikidata="Q3040890" url="?curid=715985" title="Dud Dudley">
<text>Dudd (Dud) Dudley (c.1600–1684) was an English metallurgist, who fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War as a soldier, military engineer, and supplier of munitions. He was one of the first Englishmen to smelt iron ore using coke.

==Background and early life==
Dudley was the illegitimate son of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley of Dudley Castle. Dudd was the fourth of Lord Dudley&#x27;s eleven children by his &quot;concubine&quot; Elizabeth, the daughter of William Tomlinson (she died 3 July 1629). Strictly, he was called Dudd Dudley otherwise Tomlinson. His eldest brother was Robert Dudley of Netherton Hall. Dudd married Eleanor Heaton, (1606–1675), on 12 October 1626, at St. Helen&#x27;s Church, Worcester.

Lord Dudley (though he had a legitimate son, and a granddaughter by him, as well as four legitimate daughters and numerous grandchildren) seemed to have attended to the up-bringing of his natural children by Elizabeth Tomlinson; he educated and provided for them. On the other hand, he failed to support his wife and legitimate children, even after he was imprisoned and ordered to do so by the Privy Council in 1597. Dudd was raised at Himley Hall. As a youth, he began his study on the various processes of iron manufacturing at his father&#x27;s iron works near Dudley. His speculations in the improvement of iron production were encouraged by his father, who gave him an education intended to enhance his practical abilities.

==Ironmaster==
In 1622, at the age of about 20, Dud left Balliol College, Oxford, to take charge of his father&#x27;s furnace and forges on Pensnett Chase. Later he referred to &quot;wood and charcoal growing then scant and pit-coles [coal] ... abounding&quot;, and so began to use the latter. He turned the coal into coke, a hard, foam-like mass of almost pure carbon made from bituminous coal, and later claimed to have perfected the use of coal instead of charcoal for iron production.

Dudley probably modified his furnace to accommodate the new process, but the quantity of iron initially produced was reduced to about three tons a week from a furnace. Dudd wrote to his father, then in London, informing him of his success, desiring him to immediately seek a patent from King James. Dudley&#x27;s patent, dated 22 February 1622, was taken out by (and in the name of) his father Edward, Lord Dudley.

Dudley proceeded with the manufacture of iron at Pensnett, and Cradley in Staffordshire, and a year after the patent was granted he was able to send a considerable quantity of the new iron for trial to the Tower of London. Under the King&#x27;s command, many experiments were made with it: its qualities were fairly tested, and it was pronounced &quot;good merchantable iron&quot;.

The Black Country, including Dudley, was already a major centre of iron manufacture in England (&quot;Within ten miles of Dudley Castle there were 20,000 smiths of all sorts and many iron works at that time within that circle decayed for want of wood&quot;). With such an obvious abundance of coal, some places being found in seams up to ten feet thick, and ironstone four feet in depth immediately under the coal, and with limestone adjacent to both, the ability to make iron with coal (coke) held out the prospect of great profits, but Dudd Dudley failed to obtain them. As water power was the main means of driving bellows for furnaces, as well as drop hammers, rolling and sharpening mills, iron production and working in Staffordshire and Worcestershire was concentrated along the small rivers: the Worcestershire Stour, its main tributary, the River Smestow, and many smaller streams in their catchment.

===The great Mayday flood===
The new works had been in successful operation little more than a year, when a flood swept away Dudley&#x27;s principal works at Cradley, and otherwise caused considerable damage downstream.

Dudd, undaunted and with a passion, set to work repairing his furnaces and forges at some great cost; and in a short time was again back in full production. However, the &quot;charcoal ironmasters ... did him much prejudice, not only by detaining his stock, but disparaging the iron&quot;.

In order to ascertain the quality of the product by testing it on a large scale, the King commanded Dudd to send to the Tower of London quantities of all the various sorts of bar iron made by him, fit for the &quot;making of muskets, carbines, and iron for great bolts for shipping; which iron&quot;, records Dudd, &quot;being so tried by artists and smiths, the iron masters and iron-mongers were all silenced until the 21st year of King James&#x27;s reign&quot;.

===Later furnaces===
However, this favourable report on his iron did not prevent him being &quot;outed of his works and inventions ... by the Iron-masters and others wrongfully&quot;. This certainly applies to his second furnace, at Himley, which his father let this to Richard Foley in 1625, and may well apply to Cradley, which was later in Foley&#x27;s hands.

Afterwards he built a new furnace, Hasco or Hascod Furnace, near what is now Askew Bridge at Gornal. 

Dudley was economical with the truth. Hasco furnace was built in 1626, but in November 1627 he let it to Roger Hill, who assigned it to Foley. After Foley had used it for nine months he heard that Lord Dudley was claiming it and &quot;durst not bring any stock&quot; there, but continued to pay the rent. Dudd and Foley had an oral agreement for the supply of ironstone, but Lord Dudley discharged the workmen from the mines, and stopped Foley&#x27;s horses carrying the ironstone until Foley paid for it (again) to Lord Dudley. Ultimately, his father &quot;entered&quot; the furnace in 1631, and cut the dam. The bellows were probably cut without Lord Dudley&#x27;s approval, but his re-entry to forfeit the lease was lawful and thus not a riot.

==After ironmaking==
Dudley &quot;claimed&quot; the manor of Himley, because his father had at one point put this in his name, probably to avoid it being seized by his creditors. This led to Chancery proceedings, which he lost, spending a time in prison for contempt of court.

He obtained a new patent in 1638 for smelting metals with pitcoal, but was probably unable to exploit it. Of this period, he wrote:
==Civil War==
He served as an army officer in the Bishops War and on the Royalist side throughout the English Civil War. He served as a colonel in the Royalist Army and was general of the ordnance to Prince Maurice, and then Lord Astley. He may have supervised the modernisation of the Worcester City defences in time for the aborted siege of 1643, and was taken prisoner at the end of the Siege of Worcester in 1646. In 1648, he and others were captured by Andrew Yarranton (a Parliamentary captain) in &quot;Bosco Bello&quot; (Boscobel) woods, while they were planning a Royalist rising to seize Dawley Castle. He was sent to London and tried for treason. He and his fellow conspirators were condemned to death, but escaped during &quot;sermon time&quot; from the Gatehouse, the prison at Westminster where they were held.

He escaped to Bristol and lived in hiding as &quot;Dr Hunt&quot;, a medical doctor. In 1651, shortly before the 1638 patent was due to expire, he set up lead smelting works in partnership with connections of a medical patient, using an &quot;old belhouse for the bloomery&quot; at Clifton, Bristol. This was probably a reverberatory furnace and the first known use of such for this purpose. This did not work out, but it is possible that he was associated with a later venture at Stockley Slade (now Nightingale Valley) on the other side of the Avon.

==&quot;Metallum Martis&quot;==

After the Restoration, Dudd&#x27;s lands reverted to him, having been sold by &quot;usurping powers&quot; in about 1652.

His book &quot;Metallum Martis&quot; (1665—quoted above) is Dudd Dudley&#x27;s personal view of his discovery, after he had unsuccessfully petitioned King Charles II, to restore his public offices and patents.

Metallum Martis may be regarded as a prospectus, seeking investors to exploit his invention of coke smelting. This appears to have been successful as a furnace was built at Dudley (whose existence is recalled by the street name &quot;Furnace Road&quot;. In subsequent litigation, Sir Clement Clerke (one of the partners) stated, Dud Dudley did heretofore build a furnace for making iron or melting ironstone to be blown or set on work by the strength of men and horses without the help of water. This melted down &quot;ironstone with charcoal made of wood and pitcoal&quot;. Such a horsemill-powered blast furnace is almost certainly unique, and only operated for a few years.

Dudley&#x27;s last years are obscure. He probably lived in Friar Street, Worcester, where he had a house derived from his first wife&#x27;s family. He may have practised as a doctor there. He married again and had a son in his old age. He died in 1684, at age 85. He was buried in the parish church St. Helen&#x27;s, Worcester (25 October 1684), where he had erected a monument to his first wife, bearing the following Latin inscription (see illustration):

The date of Dudley&#x27;s death does not appear on the monument.

==Posterity==
The existence of &quot;Metallum Martis&quot; meant that many historians have noted his achievements. Dud has been seen as the forerunner of later success by Abraham Darby and others in smelting iron with coke in the 18th century. However it remains unclear to what extent he was its technological ancestor rather than a mere precursor. For example, in the 1950s it was shown by chemical analysis that the coal that Dud Dudley used was not suitable as a raw material for coke while the coal used by Abraham Darby was suitable, leading Richard Kirby to state in 1990 that &quot;The consensus among experts is that Dudley was a wishful thinker ... and that he never did what he set out in his youth to do&quot;.

In &quot;Metallum Martis&quot;, Dudley named a relative of his first wife to whom he would leave his knowledge, but nothing came of that. However, there are two possible linkages to later developments:
* Abraham Darby, who took over the ironworks at Coalbrookdale in 1709, was descended from Dudd&#x27;s older full sister (also the daughter of Elizabeth Tomlinson).
* Sir Clement Clerke, a partner in the Dudley furnace, developed lead smelting in reverberatory furnaces. He and his son Talbot Clerke then applied this method to copper smelting and to iron foundry work. Associates in the latter business, floated as the Company for Making Iron with Pitcoal, built a coke furnace at Cleator in Cumberland in the 1690s. That company had some dispute with Shadrach Fox of Coalbrookdale, who was casting shot for the Board of Ordnance, and it may have used coal at another furnace at Wombridge.

<text>Finishing (also known as &quot;double matured&quot; or &quot;wood-finished&quot;) is the procedure that some whiskies undergo where the spirit is matured in a cask of a particular origin and then spends time in a cask of different origin (from a couple of months up to the entire maturation) Typically, the first cask is an American oak cask formerly used to mature bourbon. The second cask may be one that has been used to mature some sort of fortified wine, often sherry, though sometimes casks for port, madeira, or even red burgundy or chardonnay are used.

Some of the more well-known finished whiskies include Balvenie &quot;Doublewood&quot;, which is finished in sherry casks; Oak &amp; Eden In-Bottle Finished Whiskey, which is finished with a spiral-cut piece of wood inside the bottle; Angel&#x27;s Envy bourbon, which is finished in port and rum barrels; Glenlivet &quot;American Oak Finish&quot; and &quot;French Oak Finish&quot;, which are finished in brand-new casks of the respective woods; the Glenmorangie range of sherry, port, madeira, and burgundy finishes; and the Diageo line of &quot;Distiller&#x27;s Editions&quot;, a &quot;Double Matured&quot; expression of each of their classics line of single malt scotch whiskies.

<text>The grey teal (Anas gracilis) is a dabbling duck found in open wetlands in Australia and New Zealand.

== Description ==
It can be identified due to the presence of a crimson coloured iris in its eyes. This crimson colour is relatively more prominent in adult males. It is a mottled brown duck with white and green flashes on its wings. Males and females share the same colouration, in contrast to the related chestnut teal, whose male and female are strikingly different. The grey teal has almost identical colouration to the female chestnut teal and the grey can only be distinguished by its lighter coloured neck and paler face. Juveniles are paler than adults, especially on the head. However, they can be identified by a dull brown eye until matured. The bill of the grey teal is a blue-grey colour with dark lining around the edges. Feet are a similar colour to that of the bill being grey. The head of the grey teal can be described as plain/slightly streaked, with a dark crown and cream coloured chin/throat and cheeks.

The eggs of the grey teal are a creamy white colour and are not distinctly speckled. An average egg is in length and in width.
The grey teal nests near its favoured freshwater lakes and marshes, usually on the ground, but also in tree holes or rabbit burrows.

It is a vocal duck, especially at night. The male gives a soft , and the female has a loud quack.

The grey teal is a gregarious species. In Australia it is nomadic, rapidly colonising suitable habitat following rain. In 1957, large numbers fled Australia, moving to New Zealand to escape drought.

Adult grey teal, &quot;Anas gracilis&quot;, undergo a flightless moult that is not fixed in the year. Before breeding season mature birds, both male and female, will undergo a body moult that excludes the wings. Then after breeding season, both partners will undergo a complete body moult (including wings). According to Janet Kear (2005), in Australia the moult of this species is correlated with climate conditions. Indeed during prolonged wet season birds postpone wing moult in order to extend the breeding one – probably in order to better exploit wetlands resources. This postponement could be explained by the fact that ducks try not to moult and breed at the same time. For some species of birds it is even impossible to do both simultaneously. If we have to draw a tendency we could say that body moult (including wings) generally occurs between the months of January to March when it is late summer or early winter. Juveniles will undergo a complete moult of the entire body other than the wings, occurring in the first autumn or early winter.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda teal, as &quot;Anas gibberifrons gracilis&quot;.

Widespread throughout its large range, the grey teal is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

== Range ==
=== Natural global range ===
The grey teal can be found as a breeding species in the following places across the globe; Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Indonesia. However, it can also be seen in the Solomons and New Caledonia where it is vagrant.

=== New Zealand range ===
The grey teal is a self-introduced species to New Zealand from Australia, where it is much more abundant. It was rare in New Zealand until the 1950s when several natural events in Australia led to a huge increase in numbers. Now it is a very common waterbird that can be found throughout New Zealand, where its Māori name is tētē. However, there are areas where the species are more concentrated (larger populations) such as the districts of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Waikato, South Auckland and Otago. Grey teal are also more likely to be found in the Canterbury region and more specifically around Lake Ellesmere. &quot;Anas gracilis&quot; has also been seen wandering in the small New Zealand islands such as Chatham Islands (July 1951, December 1998) or Snares Islands (November 1987). In general the New Zealand grey teal population is smaller than the Australian population.

== Habitat ==
The grey teal prefers to live in habitats of shallow water areas including lagoons, swamps and shallow freshwater lakes. Preference for shallower waters means that it is easier for ducklings to be able to swim and eat, which aids the rearing and survival of juveniles. The grey teal also prefers areas that have a sizeable marginal cover (meaning sufficient plant and vegetation growth around the margins), therefore they are not often seen in open spaces. Although it tends to choose freshwater sites during the breeding season, it is also known to be seen in coastal/salt waters occasionally, as well as slightly brackish waters. In terms of elevation the grey teal does not tend to populate in areas above above sea level; instead it prefers areas that are below above sea level. When nesting grey teal choose to create their nests amongst vegetation on the ground level, this vegetation may include reeds and tall grasses. They often also elevate nests above ground in tree hollows.

== Ecology ==
=== Reproduction ===
When establishing a pair-bond, male grey teal will perform a series of displays; some of these include headshakes and head rolls. These displays tend to occur in adolescent birds before breeding season, whereas for mature birds in established pair-bonds courtship rituals are used. This is because grey teal pair-bonds are long term and monogamous, which means they keep the same mate through multiple seasons. Couples stay together all year; however, when late summer moult comes they often join large flocks and stay with them until July. Moreover, “after breeding, [they] often gather at estuaries to feed on exposed mudflats”.

On average, the grey teal starts breeding at one year old. In Australia there is no reproductive season as breeding is linked to rainfall and food abundance. The species had to adapt and breed in shallow temporary water. However, in New Zealand where the climate is more humid, breeding is more seasonal even if it is still related to water level. In terms of seasonality, grey teal will tend to breed in the summer-rainfall period. However, they will also breed at any time after a significant amount of rainfall. Thus, in New Zealand laying occurs between June and September “but replacement clutches can be laid through to January”. Therefore, their breeding time seldom shows a seasonal pattern.

Nesting is usually solitary for the grey teal; however, sometimes nesting sites will be close together, meaning breeding pairs may be close to one and other. Nests are often found in tree hollows or hidden amongst vegetation on the ground. The grey teal is not known to construct nests other than using material found from its nesting site: grass and down. Females will create a bowl in the ground that they proceed to fill with litter found around the site as well as surrounding the nest/bowl with down. Between 1-7 eggs will be laid in a nest at a time. Nesting time occurs between the months of June-February in South Australia and slightly later in the area of North Australia  due to a slight difference in temperature; whereas in New Zealand grey teal tend to nest between the months of September–November.

During the incubation period, the male will stand guard and protect the female and eggs while she incubates them for 25–31 days. The clutch (group of eggs) size fluctuates, with an average clutch size being between 6-14 eggs. The laying of each egg is done in approximately 24-hour intervals with laying occurring early in the morning. If a pair loses a brood (amount of chicks hatched at the same time) they will then begin to lay again only after a few weeks. Therefore, some pairs may lay several clutches per season. However, on average the grey teal will lay approximately two broods per season.

Female grey teal will brood young by themselves, however, when necessary (e.g. death of the female) the male will take over the brooding role and raise the ducklings. Male will also often be present at the later stages of brooding as the female will return to incubate/lay her next clutch. After hatching, parents and broods may remain close to each other for a number of weeks; once the young gains flight it then becomes independent. However, siblings will often stick together for a short amount of time once they have left home.

Fledging usually occurs between 35 and 40 days. Before that ducklings are grey-brown with off-white cheeks and underpart. For juveniles, both female and male grey teal become reproductively mature at one-year-old. Therefore the forming of a pair-bonding will commonly occur in the first winter.

=== Song ===
The call of the grey teal can be heard as a that is relatively rapid and includes a sharp whistle. The male and female calls are different in terms of volume and type. The male&#x27;s call tends to be more of a whistle, whereas the female&#x27;s call is very loud and harsh sounding. For short-distance communication, the birds have a softer variation of their calls. The grey teal&#x27;s voice is very similar if not identical to the voice of a chestnut teal.

=== Migration ===
For migratory birds living in stable temperate areas, day length and temperature bring migration about by triggering hormonal changes. However, for birds living in a stochastic environment where resources are often temporary (e.g. grey teal &quot;Anas gracilis&quot;) hormonal control is less likely to allow good exploitation of resources hence allowing the survival of the species. In this type of environment birds have to be able to detect resourceful locations and relocate, meaning they have to move all year round and do not have a migration season.

The grey teal is a great avian nomad that flies long distances. It “is often the exemplar avian nomad in analyses movement and migration”. Thus, Roshier, D., Asmus, M., from Institute of Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University, Australia and Klassen, M., from the Department of Plant-Animal interaction Netherlands Institute, Netherlands, led a study about the long-distance movements of grey teal in Australia. Their goal was to determine what drives these long-distance flights. They found out that 13 out of 32 long-distance movements (&gt; ) recorded were due to rainfall and/or flooding events that occurred up to from where the ducks initially were. Thus, it seems that water resources are a major reason in explaining the movements of grey teal. However, some birds moved to other wetlands without clear beneficial reasons. So, according to Roshier, D., Asmus, M., and Klassen, M., there are two types of movements: ranging – “a search for a place to feed or breed that should stop when the resources being sought are encountered” – and directed. Either way, “these flights occurred over distances up to across the arid inland.”. Thus, grey teal disperse widely throughout the Australian continent due to adaption to environmental change such as flooding, extensive dry periods or lack of food. This process is carried out to seek their preferred environment of shallow wetlands with sufficient food supply and suitable breeding conditions. However, it is uncertain as to whether this behaviour should be referred to as &#x27;migration&#x27; or whether a more appropriate term would be &#x27;ranging&#x27;. The same applies in New Zealand where the species is very mobile. This flying skill implies that the local population of grey teal changes constantly, both in New Zealand and Australia, which can lead to quick changes in numbers at any locality.

Most animals and birds living within the Northern Hemisphere live in very temperate environments, therefore, cues for migration and movement involve the change in temperature or day length. However, cues for grey teal are believed to be more discrete. Although it is undetermined as to whether grey teal migrate specifically, their movement is triggered by cues such as pressure gradients that occur due to changing weather systems, low-frequency sound/temperature, and visual cues such as lack of food source. As well as this, it is believed that the grey teal uses its sense of smell to move and find suitable wetland environments. Information from tracked grey teal reveals that some flight movements were due to distant thunderstorms occurring. These thunderstorms were hundreds of kilometres away; however, due to their production of low-frequency sound, grey teal could detect this occurrence and move towards the source. Due to Australia being close to the equator, it can become very dry and hot in most places. Therefore, the use of these cues is essential for grey teal to find wetland habitats aiding their survival.

=== Survival rates and life expectancy ===
From a study completed by J.A. Mills on the morality and status of grey teal in New Zealand, approximate survival rates were established. To establish the rate of survival, the birds were banded. It was recorded that 68% of juveniles die within the first year of life, 77% by their first two years of life and then 85% by the end of their fourth year. Thus resulting in approximately 0.96 years of expected life for juveniles after they have been banded (age of 2–4 months). For grey teal that survive to one year of age, they are expected to have a further 2.9 years of life. For adults, the mean average was 50% of deaths annually, whereas for juveniles it was 68%. Similar results were shown in an Australian study where the mean average of deaths for adults was 52%, and for juveniles 66%. Therefore from the data collected, it can be assumed that the grey teal has an approximate life expectancy of between 2–4 years old. However, some exceptions occurred since the oldest adult recorded in the wild in New Zealand was 9 years old. It was 21 years old in Australia.

=== Diet and foraging ===
The grey teal has a diet mostly consisting of invertebrates from their habitat; these include larva of midges, water beetles, mosquitoes and caddisflies, as well as seeds from aquatic plants present in their habitat. Diet changes according to the locality and time of the year. Thus, in Australia grey teal feed mostly on plant material and especially seeds. It constitutes 87-97% of their diet. 
Although insects are eaten throughout the year, their part in the diet increases in spring. Similarly, molluscs and crustaceans are important in the diet only during spring and autumn.
In Australia, the youngest ducklings feed only on insects but the relative amount decreases to only 30% when they are four weeks old.

Grey teal will regularly retrieve their food through the process of either dredging out estuary mudflats or exposed margins of lakeside to filter out food. Dabbling and upending in shallow water areas is another technique used for food retrieval, to collect invertebrates from just below the water surface. To obtain seeds, grey teal will strip them from the aquatic vegetation. During breeding season grey teal will feed strictly in breeding pairs or family parties; however, once the breeding season is over they tend to feed as a flock. In terms of ducklings, they must forage for their own food as there is no feeding from parents that occurs. Grey teal will feed at both morning and night time.

=== Predators, parasites, and diseases ===
Predators, parasites and disease is an area that has not been particularly well studied in grey teal. However, in Australia, they are considered a game bird due to large population numbers. Therefore hunters and duck shooters are a significant predator of these birds; whereas in New Zealand the grey teal is a protected species. This means that it cannot be hunted for due to low population numbers.

Grey teal ducklings tend to be at higher risk of predation than adults. Other aviator predators pose a threat as they are known to take ducklings out of nests from approaching above. When in the water ducklings are at risk from eels, rats and swamp harriers as they have been known to predate when the ducklings are swimming. Additionally, when adult grey teal are with broods they are at risk to predators such as ferrets and stoats.

A known parasite affecting waterfowl is Sarcocystis, also known as rice breast disease that is caused by a parasitic protozoan. Although this disease usually is asymptomatic (infected but shows no symptoms) if severe the infection can result in weakness, lameness and loss of muscle tissue. With these severe effects, this can increase the likelihood of predation on the infected species, thus increasing its chance of death. No specific cases of Sarcocystis have been found in grey teal; however, it is known that this parasite targets birds and more specifically waterfowl.

The grey teal is one of three ducks known to host the virus &quot;Dalvirus anatis&quot;.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Game season and conservation status ===
The grey teal, &quot;Anas gracilis&quot;, is fully protected in New Zealand. The population was estimated at 20,000 birds in 1976 and has increased to 50,000 in 2005. In 2014 there were about 120,000 grey teal in New Zealand and over 1 million in the world. Considering that now the grey teal is a common bird in the island, the government considered adding the duck to the game bird list when the Wildlife Act was reviewed in 2010. However it did not occur and the bird kept its conservation status. According to John Dyer, northern Wildlife Manager, Auckland Waikato Fish and Game Council, this decision caused some troubles between the Department of Conservation and the hunters that felt “misled for decades”. Indeed, along with the conservation status come penalties if one kills the bird. Yet, it is difficult for hunters not to shoot grey teal as it is numerous and often be seen flying among huge flocks of game ducks. At least 6% of the grey teal population is shot during the hunting season.

On the contrary, in Australia the grey teal is one of the most common birds shot during the hunting season. For instance, in 2014, in the state of Victoria the hunting season lasted 3 months – while it only lasts 5 weeks in New Zealand – and hunters could shoot up to 10 grey teal daily. A survey conducted in Victoria on hunting grey teal revealed a significant number of injured birds. Some of these birds survive, while others suffer before eventually dying. Approximately 26% of the shot grey teal are either wounded or mutilated. Of these, 12% will be wounded and survive, whereas between 14% and 33% will be mutilated.

<doc id="715999" wikidata="Q7134959" url="?curid=715999" title="Parallel Line Internet Protocol">
<text>The Parallel Line Internet Protocol (PLIP) is a computer networking protocol for direct computer-to-computer communications using the parallel port, normally used for connections to a printer.

PLIP provides link layer services for the Internet Protocol, which is used for forming small local area networks and large computer networks, such as the Internet. This enables computers without standard dedicated networking hardware, such as Ethernet, but with older parallel port devices, to communicate.

==Operation==
The Internet Protocol Suite is the standards-based networking model and software specification for forming small and large computer networks, from local area networks to global communication systems like the Internet. It is usually implemented by software and hardware features that use Ethernet network interface cards, cabling, and networking switches or hubs.

Early personal computers did not have Ethernet hardware in their design, and bus adapters were initially expensive. A solution was to use, at the time, a standard parallel port, typically used for connection to a printer or similar output device. The ports on two computers are connected with a so-called null-printer cable, sometimes called a LapLink cable.

The LapLink cable connects five output pins of a parallel port to five input pins on the opposing port for each direction. Due to the lack of internal timing in the parallel ports, synchronization is implemented via software handshaking: four pins are used for data transfer and one is used for synchronization. The logical values at these pins are read and written directly by the software via an input or output instruction.

This method does not connect the bidirectional data lines of the two devices to prevent both lines from being active at the same time. The status lines ERROR, SLCT, PAPOUT, ACK, and BUSY on one device are connected to data pins d0 through d4, respectively, on the other.

A byte is transmitted by dividing it into two nibbles of four bits each. Each nibble is transmitted by setting the four data lines according to the four nibble bits and then toggling the acknowledge line. This toggle indicates to the receiving host that the nibble is ready to be read. Once the receiving host has read the nibble, it toggles its synchronization line to tell the transmitter that the nibble has been read and that a new one may be sent. Both hosts use a toggle on their acknowledge lines to indicate that the read or write operation has been performed. As a result, each host has to wait for a toggle from the other host before proceeding with a new operation.

As an example, the transfer of nibble proceeds as follows:

This procedure is repeated for the next nibble when the transmitter detects the toggle.

Internet Protocol packets are sent over the line after being encapsulated into PLIP packets before being transmitted over the line. The encapsulated packet has the following structure:
*packet length: 2 bytes, little endian
*ethernet header (mostly used for backward compatibility)
*the IP packet
*checksum: 1 byte, sum modulo 256 bytes in the packet

The length and checksum are calculated over the second and third fields only so that the actual total length of the packet is three more than the length reported in the first two bytes of the packet.

==Similar methods==
An analogous feature for serial communications ports is the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP), using null-modem cables but allows the transfer of four bits at a time rather than one. It generally works at higher bitrates. The method is based on the &quot;Crynwr&quot; standard devised by Russ Nelson.

Ethernet may also be used as a direct computer-to-computer communications method using an Ethernet crossover cable.

Other point-to-point connections, such as USB host-to-host bridges or cables, are also used to transfer files between two computers where a network is not necessary or available.

<text>A brass quintet is a five-piece musical ensemble composed of brass instruments. The instrumentation for a brass quintet typically includes two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone.The two instrumentations of the brass quintet that are currently in use are the quintet of two trumpets, horn, trombone, and tuba; and the quintet of two trumpets, horn, trombone, and bass trombone&quot;(Lindhaul 1988). Musicians in a brass quintet may often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players for instance may double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. There can be variation in instrumentation depending on the type of quintet. In some quintets, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. Euphonium may also be substituted for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, tambourine, or timpani. 

== History ==
The earliest brass chamber music was written in the mid to late 1800s and coincided with the invention of brass instruments that could play chromatically. The Distin family formed one of the first brass quintets in 1833, touring Europe and the United States to promote a new family of brass instruments called saxhorns. French composer Jean-François Bellon and Russian composer Victor Ewald, led the development of brass chamber music in Paris and Russia during this period. Bellon published the first series of twelve brass quintets in 1850 while Ewald composed his quintets between the years 1888 and 1912 all while improvements were being made to brass instruments. The improvement of brass instruments played a big role later on in the history of brass quintets as it allowed the player to do more with the instrument which in turn allowed for more artistry. 

The modern brass quintet has only been around for six decades as prior to World War II, there were only a select number of pieces written for brass quintet. The brass quintet is believed to have not been established as a formal chamber ensemble until 1947. This is known as there had to have been compositions for brass chamber, as well as the existence of amateur and professional groups.The instrumentation for brass ensembles would have also needed to “remain constant for a sustained period of time before 1947.” Prior to 1947, many composers began composing for the modern day brass quintet instrumentation that was later established by the New York Brass Quintet.
== Brass quintets in the United States of America ==

The contemporary brass quintet appeared in the early 1950s with the New York Brass Quintet, followed in the 1960s by the American Brass Quintet, Chicago Brass Quintet, and Eastman Brass Quintet. Robert Nagel can be credited with forming the first serious brass quintet in the United States, the New York Brass Quintet in 1954, and it was this ensemble that commissioned and premiered the first major brass quintet pieces in the repertoire like the Malcolm Arnold, Gunther Schuller and Alvin Etler brass quintets. Although the New York Brass Quintet did play pieces such as the Malcolm Arnold etc., much of their repertoire consisted of transcriptions of music from the Renaissance and Baroque. The Annapolis Brass Quintet was the first brass quintet in the United States to have its members perform with the group full-time. The group frequently performed throughout North America, Europe, and Asia from its founding in 1971 until the group disbanded in 1993. However, it was with the founding of Canadian Brass in 1970 that the brass quintet became a popular entertainment attraction in the chamber music world. Canadian Brass established both the style and popularity of the quintet medium throughout the world, having performed more than five thousand concerts, selling more than 500,000 quintet music books, and creating a library of over 600 compositions and arrangements for brass quintet. They continue to be one of the most popular and recognizable contemporary brass quintets. The brass quintet has accrued a sizable amount of literature for an ensemble that was only firmly established halfway through the 20th century. Notable contributions to the literature include many commissions by modern ensembles such as the American Brass Quintet and transcriptions by other ensembles such as the Canadian Brass. More specifically, Dr. Arthur Frackenpohl wrote many arrangements and transcriptions for the Canadian Brass for over 20 years and played a pivotal role in producing repertoire not only for the Canadian Brass but for all Brass Quintets.

== International Brass Quintet Festival ==
In 1980 the International Brass Quintet Festival and Symposium was established and at the time, was the only one to exist. This festival, similar to many of the festivals we see for Orchestra or Band, featured music forums, masterclasses, competitions, in-residence programs and free concerts. This festival was held between 1980 through 1992 at the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore, Maryland. During this time many world-renowned brass quintets made appearances including the Budapest Brass Quintet, Le Concert Arban from Paris, Ensemble Prisma from Vienna, and the Theo Martens Brass Quintet. In 1989 history was made as the Berlin Brass Quintet from East Berlin shared the stage with the Brandenburg Quintet from West Berlin before the Berlin Wall had officially fallen.

<text>Peter Thomas Ratajczyk (January 4, 1962 – April 14, 2010), known professionally as Peter Steele, was an American musician, best known as the lead vocalist, bassist and composer of the gothic metal band Type O Negative. Before forming Type O Negative, Steele had formed the heavy metal group Fallout and the thrash metal band Carnivore.

As the frontman for Type O Negative, Steele was known for his vampiric appearance, stature, rich bass vocals, and a dark, often self-deprecating sense of humor. His lyrics have been described as &quot;often intensely personal, dealing with subjects including love, loss and addiction.&quot; Steele credited Black Sabbath and the Beatles as his key musical influences. He has been listed among the &quot;66 Best Hard Rock and Metal Frontmen of All Time&quot; by &quot;Loudwire&quot;.

==Early life==
Steele was born Peter Thomas Ratajczyk on January 4, 1962, in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York City, to a Catholic family. His father was of Polish descent and his mother of Scottish-Irish ancestry. He was raised in the Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Steele was the youngest of six children, with five older sisters. His father fought in World War II and later worked at a shipyard. Steele started taking guitar lessons at age 12, before moving on to bass six months later.

Though Steele was naturally left-handed, he played right-handed bass guitars throughout his career. This came about when one of his earliest bands, Aggression (also featuring Josh Silver), for which Steele played left-handed rhythm guitar, threatened to kick him out unless he switched to bass guitar. As a left-handed bass guitar proved to be too expensive at the time, Steele purchased a right-handed bass and taught himself how to play it.

Steele attended Edward R. Murrow High School in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. Steele worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation until he began touring with Type O Negative in the summer of 1994. He was based at Brooklyn Heights Promenade, where his job involved park maintenance, driving vehicles including garbage trucks and steamrollers, and eventual promotion to the role of park supervisor. Steele considered his days working for the parks department to be among his happiest.

==Musical career==
===Fallout and Carnivore (1979–1987)===
In 1979, Steele formed the heavy metal band Fallout. In 1982, after the split of Fallout, Steele formed the thrash metal band Carnivore. With Carnivore, Steele&#x27;s lyrics were often harsh, dealing with religion, war, race and misogyny. Carnivore released their debut self-titled album in 1985. In 1986, Steele wrote lyrics for several songs on hardcore punk band Agnostic Front&#x27;s second album &quot;Cause for Alarm&quot;. In 1987, Carnivore released &quot;Retaliation&quot;, before splitting up later that year.

===Type O Negative===

====Formation====
Steele formed the band in 1989 along with his childhood friends Josh Silver, Kenny Hickey and Sal Abruscato (later replaced by Johnny Kelly). The band originally used the name &quot;Repulsion&quot;, but had to change it in 1990 due to legal issues with the American grindcore band of the same name. The band then used the name &quot;Subzero&quot;. Steele had a tattoo in mind of a minus sign contained within the number 0 that he originally intended to represent the Subzero band logo. After discovering that another band was already using the Subzero name, and with his tattoo in mind, Steele came up with the name &quot;Type O Negative&quot; after hearing a radio advertisement requesting donations of type O negative blood. When Type O Negative signed with Roadrunner Records, Steele signed his recording contract with a mixture of Suave hair conditioner and chocolate syrup mixed with food dye, contrary to popular belief that it was his own blood and semen.

====&quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot; and &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot; (1991–1992)====
Type O Negative&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot;, was released in 1991. The album incorporated the thrash elements of Carnivore merged with doom metal. Steele had written the music in the space of one night in the aftermath of a relationship break-up, and this was reflected in the lyrical topics of heartbreak, fantasies of revenge, and the contemplation of suicide; something Steele had himself attempted: &quot;On October 15th, 1989, I slashed my wrists. All I can say is that I fell in love with the wrong person.&quot;

Steele caused some controversy when touring in Europe to support &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot;, thanks to rumors about his social and political views, with some critics going so far as to brand him a Nazi sympathizer, even though his bandmate, Josh Silver, is Jewish. Steele suggested that the European press had misunderstood his humor, and that his sarcasm was sometimes lost in translation to print.

In 1992, Type O Negative released the &quot;live&quot; album &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot;. The album included a fictitious hostile audience and an evacuation of the venue after a bomb threat had supposedly been called in. This simulated some of the real-life responses Steele and Type O Negative had recently received while on tour in Europe. The original album cover featured a close-up shot of Steele&#x27;s anus.

====&quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, &quot;October Rust&quot; and &quot;World Coming Down&quot; (1993–2002)====
In 1993, Type O Negative released its breakthrough album &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;. The album focused primarily on romance, love, sex, and death. The song &quot;Black No.1 (Little Miss Scare-All)&quot; pays tribute to gothic subculture and is a satirical ode to a goth girl Steele had once dated. Steele attacked his detractors with the songs &quot;We Hate Everyone&quot; and &quot;Kill All the White People&quot;, which dealt directly with the band&#x27;s rumored racist ideology and served to erode any such accusations. &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot; eventually achieved Platinum status and established Type O Negative as one of gothic metal&#x27;s most influential bands.

Type O Negative released the album &quot;October Rust&quot; in 1996. It featured a more multi-layered and melodic sound than its predecessor, though it retained similar lyrical themes. Steele penned the majority of the material on &quot;October Rust&quot; while on the road touring, though he had conceived some of the basic musical ideas during his early teens. Steele designed the Vinland flag that first appeared on the &quot;October Rust&quot; artwork. It has since appeared on every subsequent release by the band. The flag encompassed a variety of Steele&#x27;s interests, political beliefs and his heritage. Steele based the design on a Nordic cross flag that incorporates his favorite colors. The concept of Vinland is also referred to in the title of the track &quot;The Glorious Liberation of the People&#x27;s Technocratic Republic of Vinland by the Combined Forces of the United Territories of Europa&quot;. &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot; is a tale about a ménage à trois that Steele based on a few true-life experiences. The song &quot;Green Man&quot; had two meanings for Steele; it is written about the Celtic embodiment of nature, and Steele&#x27;s time with the parks department, when young children called him the &quot;Green Man&quot; due to the green uniform he wore on the job. The song introduction includes a sample of the garbage truck once driven by Steele. The song &quot;Red Water (Christmas Mourning)&quot; is about his father&#x27;s death. &quot;October Rust&quot; eventually achieved Gold status.

Steele had been dealing with personal problems during the recording and mixing of 1999&#x27;s stripped-down and heavier sounding &quot;World Coming Down&quot;. Themes of drug abuse and addiction appeared on the album, particularly on the song &quot;White Slavery&quot;. Death also featured heavily on the album, with Steele mourning the loss of loved ones on the tracks &quot;Everyone I Love is Dead&quot; and &quot;Everything Dies&quot;. Steele recounted his experience with psychiatric treatment on the song &quot;Who Will Save the Sane?&quot;. On &quot;Pyretta Blaze&quot; Steele tells of his sexual fantasy involving fire. Steele noted the emotional strain caused by executing songs from &quot;World Coming Down&quot; in a live setting. The setlists for live shows performed since the initial tour to support &quot;World Coming Down&quot; usually featured very few selections from the album.

In 2000, Steele made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Just Say No To Love&quot; from &quot;Iommi&quot;, the first solo album by Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi. In 2001, Steele made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Cross the Line&quot; from the Biohazard album &quot;Uncivilization&quot;. In 2002, he guest appeared on the track &quot;Descent&quot; from the Doro album &quot;Fight&quot;.

====&quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot; and &quot;Dead Again&quot; (2003–2010)====
Type O Negative released the album &quot;Life Is Killing Me&quot; in 2003. Lyrically the album deals with topics including self-pity, hatred, drugs, death and religion. On the title track Steele offers his criticism of the medical profession. The song &quot;Nettie&quot; centers around Steele&#x27;s mother, while &quot;Todd&#x27;s Ship Gods (Above All Things)&quot; is about his father. &quot;The Dream is Dead&quot; refers to Steele finding it difficult to celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day as the date coincides with the anniversary of his father&#x27;s death. Steele wrote the song &quot;(We Were) Electrocute&quot; about a &quot;stunning&quot; ex-girlfriend, and how they would attract the interest of passers-by when out together as a couple. Steele&#x27;s favorite female television characters are the inspiration for the track &quot;How Could She?&quot;. &quot;I Like Goils&quot; makes light of the attention Steele received from gay men, specifically after his photo shoot for &quot;Playgirl&quot; magazine.

In 2005, Type O Negative left Roadrunner Records. Steele had never been happy with the conditions of the recording contract and had described it as &quot;a millstone around my neck&quot;. Steele alleged that Type O Negative&#x27;s split from Roadrunner Records, aside from a poor offer, had to do with an unauthorized release of a best-of compilation. Steele remained on friendly terms with the staff at Roadrunner Records and in October 2005 he appeared on the &quot;Roadrunner United&quot; album to help celebrate the label&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

There were unconfirmed rumors at one point of Steele&#x27;s death after the band website posted an image of a tombstone bearing his name and the dates 1962–2005. According to an article dated May 14, 2005, Steele was not dead; the gag was related to their fresh signing with SPV Records. The website discontinued the tombstone picture in October 2005.

In 2006, Steele reactivated Carnivore with a new lineup that included longtime Type O Negative collaborator Paul Bento. The band played at the Wacken Open Air festival in 2006.

Steele made his final recording on the 2007 Type O Negative album &quot;Dead Again&quot;. He revealed on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; that the new alliance with SPV Records was probably his favorite thing about &quot;Dead Again&quot; from a production standpoint. Steele considered &quot;Dead Again&quot; to be less melancholic and more positive compared to the band&#x27;s previous albums. The album cover depicts the Russian mystic Rasputin, a historical figure that Steele admired. The title track touches on drug abuse and Steele&#x27;s sense of having killed part of himself after suffering a relapse. &quot;Tripping a Blind Man&quot; is a diatribe on how Steele felt after his involuntary commitment was brought about by his family. &quot;Halloween in Heaven&quot; is a song about dead rockstars that Steele was inspired to write by the death of his close friend Dimebag Darrell. Steele&#x27;s final live performance was on Halloween night at Harpos Concert Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, the last show of Type O Negative&#x27;s 2009 tour.

==Further appearances==
===&quot;Playgirl&quot;===
Following the success of &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, Steele began to receive attention outside of music. He appeared as a nude centerfold of &quot;Playgirl&quot; in 1995. Steele later found out via bandmate Kenny Hickey&#x27;s contacts that only 23% of the magazine subscribers were female, and after being asked by men to sign copies of the magazine, Steele somewhat regretted the decision: &quot;After I did it, I thought, &#x27;Oh my God, what did I do?&#x27; It was more than upsetting that so many guys had it. Girls, OK, but there just seemed to be at least as many guys. Not that I&#x27;m homophobic, but it was certainly irritating.&quot; In a 2007 interview, Steele reflected on the posing as merely a naive publicity stunt.

===Television and film===
Steele went on to appear as a guest on the talk shows &quot;Ricki Lake&quot;, &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;, and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. In 2003, Steele had an acting role in the episode &quot;Exeunt Omnes&quot; of the series &quot;Oz&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the film &quot;Dirtbags (Armpit of Metal)&quot;. He followed this with a role in the 2005 film &quot;Bad Acid&quot;. Steele is among the musicians featured in the 2011 documentary &quot;Living the American Nightmare&quot;.

==Personal life==

Steele stood 6&#x27; 7&quot; (201 cm) tall, giving him a menacing stage appearance. Despite that perception, Steele admitted to suffering from stage fright, which he overcame by drinking alcohol before shows, and by drinking red wine when on stage. He was also described as a person who was &quot;friendly, funny and had a reputation for being generous to his longtime bandmates ... and kind to the bands he toured with.&quot; In his autobiography &quot;Iron Man&quot;, Black Sabbath&#x27;s Tony Iommi described his shock at Steele&#x27;s death, adding, &quot;Peter was a big, tall, and very, very nice guy.&quot;

Outside of music, Steele spent time lifting weights both at home and on his tour bus. Steele also enjoyed reading books on the subject of science and he had an interest in European culture. Steele liked working on his house and was interested in architecture and civil engineering. Steele also worked on his cars, including a heavily modified 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix he customized himself. Steele had a love for cats and kept several as pets. In the booklet for the 2009 &quot;Top Shelf&quot; edition re-release of &quot;Bloody Kisses&quot;, Steele confirmed that the album&#x27;s dirge-like 11-minute title track had in fact been written about the death of a family cat called Venus he had owned for 17 years.

During 2005, Steele disappeared for an extended period with no explanation. Rumors of his death, terminal illness, and other speculations increased until the mystery was dispelled in an interview on the 2006 DVD &quot;Symphony for the Devil&quot;. In the interview Steele briefly mentions his incarceration in Rikers Island and &quot;the psych ward at Kings County Hospital&quot;. Steele&#x27;s family members had staged an intervention and insisted he check into a mental institution. Steele later confirmed he had been suffering from paranoia caused by his heavy substance abuse. Steele had been using cocaine since the age of 35, a decision for which he expressed great regret. Steele then attended rehab for cocaine dependence and alcoholism, and later served a 30-day prison term for assaulting a &quot;love rival.&quot; Steele made light of his incarceration by wearing a prison uniform on stage during live performances.

Steele stated in a 2003 interview that he had bipolar disorder, and linked his mood swings to the types of songs he wrote. He also received occasional psychiatric treatment for depressive episodes. During a 2007 interview Steele explained:&quot;I&#x27;ve always been a very depressed person, but that&#x27;s only one side of me, you know. It makes me feel better when I can express my depression, my anger, my frustration through music ... sonic therapy.&quot;

In April 2007, Steele revealed that he began identifying again as Catholic in recent years, after decades of self-professed atheism. In an interview with &quot;Decibel&quot; magazine, Steele explained: &quot;There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist for a long time. But after going through a midlife crisis and having many things change very quickly, it made me realize my mortality. And when you start to think about death, you start to think about what&#x27;s after it. And then you start hoping there is a God. For me, it&#x27;s a frightening thought to go nowhere. I also can&#x27;t believe that people like Hitler are gonna go to the same place as Mother Teresa.&quot;
Steele&#x27;s biography &quot;Soul on Fire – The Life and Music of Peter Steele&quot; was written by &quot;Metal Maniacs&quot; editor Jeff Wagner, and was released in 2013. None of the surviving band members cooperated with Wagner in the creation of the book.

==Death and tributes==
In an interview given before his death, Steele noted that, as a result of his long lasting dependence on alcohol and cocaine, he had developed problems with some of his organs. He had stated: 

Steele died of sepsis caused by diverticulitis (initially reported as heart failure) on April 14, 2010, at the age of 48. Prior to his death, he was preparing to write and record new music. The remaining members of Type O Negative decided to dissolve the band rather than replace Steele, with Johnny Kelly stating &quot;Even if there is somebody who could take his place it wouldn&#x27;t matter. We don&#x27;t have any interest in continuing. It&#x27;s impossible – it hasn&#x27;t even come up in any kind of discussion. When Peter died, Type O Negative died with him.&quot;

<text>The Madrona Marsh Preserve, in the city of Torrance in the South Bay region of Southern California, is a seasonal wetland with vernal pools. The was a former site of oil wells and is one of the few natural areas remaining within an urban landscape.

Formed eons ago when the mountains of the Palos Verdes Peninsula rose to the south, Madrona Marsh is a shallow depression fed by wet season (spring) storms as the name &quot;vernal&quot; indicates. After the rainy season, evaporation, percolation and transpiration reduce the water depth by about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) per day. By the end of August, the wetland is dry and remains so until the following rainy season. Situated on land that was set aside for oil production in 1924, Madrona Marsh was never developed while the city grew up around the site and remains a valuable natural habitat for birds, reptiles, insects and small mammals.

Ongoing efforts are restoring native plants including wildflowers. Plantings may benefit local butterfly species including the Palos Verdes blue. The area has long been popular with bird watchers and The Audubon Society has used Madrona Marsh for their annual bird census since 1967. El Camino College uses it as an outdoor biology and botany lab.

The Madrona Marsh Nature Center is operated by the City of Torrance in cooperation with the Friends of the Madrona Marsh. Activities include bird and nature walks, natural history classes and workshops, habitat restoration, science and astronomy programs, art exhibits, and children&#x27;s nature programs. The center opened in 2001 and features exhibits about the plants, birds and animals of the marsh. The nature center for the Preserve is across the street.

<doc id="716026" wikidata="Q3241309" url="?curid=716026" title="Lincoln Park Zoo">
<text>Lincoln Park Zoo, also known as Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, is a zoo in Lincoln Park, Chicago, Illinois. The zoo was founded in 1868 and is the second oldest zoo in the United States. It is also one of a small number of zoos to offer free admission. The zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). In 2019 it also became an accredited arboretum.

Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. The zoo&#x27;s exhibits include big cats, polar bears, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totaling about 1,100 animals from some 200 species.

The Lincoln Park Zoo was long home to a burr oak tree which was estimated to more than 250 years old. The tree was cut down on May 2, 2023, due to poor health. Thirty-six scions of the tree were grafted onto root stock and are growing at the Morton Arboretum.

==History==


The zoo was founded in 1868, when the Lincoln Park Commissioners were given a gift of two pairs of swans by Central Park&#x27;s Board of Commissioners in New York City. Other animals were soon donated to the park, including, a puma, two elk, three wolves, four eagles, and eight peacock. In 1874, a bear cub from the Philadelphia Zoo was the first animal purchased by the zoo, for US$10. The bear became quite adept at escaping from its home and could frequently be found roaming Lincoln Park at night. In 1884, reportedly the first American bison born in captivity was born at the Lincoln Park Zoo. At this time, the species had been hunted almost to extinction in the wild—in 1896, the United States government purchased one bull and seven cows from the Zoo&#x27;s bison herd to send to Yellowstone National Park to assist in the species&#x27; revival.

From 1888 to 1919 the director of the Lincoln Park Zoo was the flamboyant Cy DeVry, who organized the collection, built many new structures, and obtained the zoo&#x27;s first elephant and monkeys. A new Lion House opened in 1912. It was later renovated and reopened in 1990. The Primate House opened in 1927, and it was known for housing a popular gorilla named Bushman (1931–1951), one of the only gorillas in a U. S. zoo at the time. From 1920 until a Zoo expansion in 1994, the 1893 World&#x27;s Fair Viking ship was located at the zoo. The zoo&#x27;s great apes were moved to the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House in 1976, named for the zoo&#x27;s outgoing director, and the original Primate House was later renovated and reopened in 1992 as the Helen Brach Primate House, featuring more naturalistic settings.

Marlin Perkins, who gained fame as the host of the television program &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, and later &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;, was director of the zoo from 1944 until 1962. He created and recruited a citizens group, the Lincoln Park Zoological Society, to support the Zoo&#x27;s mission. The facility underwent a dramatic transformation in the 1970s and 1980s, with the additions of many new, naturalistic exhibits. In 1995, the Zoological Society assumed management of the zoo from the Chicago Park District, which is the land owner and became lessee of the Zoo in charge of administration and improvements. Zoo administration is currently housed in the nearby building previously used by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, which moved to a new facility in 1999. The Kovler Sea Lion Pool opened the same year after an extensive renovation, and it is now home to the zoo&#x27;s harbor seals.

Regenstein African Journey, a renovation of the zoo&#x27;s former Large Mammal House, opened in 2003, turning the zoo&#x27;s largest building from concrete showcases for a few large mammals into a series of naturalistic settings that tell the story of the wildlife of the African continent, welcoming the return of the zoo&#x27;s African elephants and giraffes as well as new additions such as the aardvark, ostrich, and African wild dog. Two years later, the zoo renovated its Great Ape House, opening the Regenstein Center for African Apes, which focused on the zoo&#x27;s troops of common chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas, putting a special emphasis on researching the behaviors of both species and creating new, naturalistic habitats.

In 2003, the book &quot;The Ark in the Park: The Story of Lincoln Park Zoo&quot; was also published by the University of Illinois Press. The book was written by Mark Rosenthal, Carol Tauber, and Edward Uhlir.

In 2010, Lincoln Park Zoo transformed the adjacent South Pond to create the Nature Boardwalk, an ecological habitat designed by Studio Gang Architects that features native wetlands plants and wildlife.

In December 2011, the Kovler Penguin-Seabird House, which had previously been home to rockhopper, king penguins, common murres and puffins closed down after thirty years at the zoo due to worries about the deteriorating condition of the building, prompting outcry from some Chicago residents. It was soon announced it would be replaced with a newly renovated West Gate, featuring a children&#x27;s train and an all-new exhibit, Regenstein Macaque Forest, featuring Japanese macaques, or &quot;snow monkeys&quot;, in a state-of-the-art exhibit with a hot spring, set to open in fall 2014.

It was announced in March 2014 that the zoo&#x27;s Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat, or &quot;Bear Line&quot;, would be torn down and rebuilt with a large and significantly improved habitat for the zoo&#x27;s lone polar bear, with much more land area for the bears and a behind-the-scenes den for breeding. The new exhibit would also feature a new African penguin habitat, a new species for the zoo from the tropical coasts of Africa, enabling them to stand the zoo&#x27;s harsh summers as well as its cold winters. This exhibit would also be fully outdoors and equipped for over a dozen penguins with a behind-the-scenes breeding area. Construction began after the opening of Regenstein Macaque Forest in fall 2014, with Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove opening in late 2016.

In 2016, the Zoo announced the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, which sought $125 million in funding, and lead to the construction of Regenstein Macaque Forest, Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove and Walter Family Arctic Tundra, would conclude with a long-awaited $30 million renovation of the aging Kovler Lion House as part of the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, acknowledging the public perception problems with the exhibit, which had been constrained by its Historic Landmark status during previous renovations, most recently in 1992. The new exhibit opened in late 2021 and focuses squarely on lions as opposed to other big cat species it had previously held, such as tigers .

===Programming===

The zoo together with technological help from the Adler Planetarium is aiming to expand its survey of Chicago area wildlife with public assistance at an interactive website, Zooniverse. The zoo has positioned motion sensing cameras in the Chicago area to catch images of wildlife, and the public is asked to help identify the animals.

The Zoo operates a number of youth-focused programs including a number of year-round camps, facilitated school program field trips, and a number of community engagement initiatives that prioritize the Little Village and North Lawndale communities. Both the Little Village and North Lawndale outreach programs include community gardening programs that focus on creating green spaces in Chicago and on promoting healthy eating habits.

Like many other zoos and aquariums nationally, Lincoln Park Zoo adapted many of their programs to the digital format during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included creating modified versions of their local program offerings, such as running their Artecito program, which connects Little Village families with nature through the arts, in conjunction with the OPEN Center for the Arts through free biweekly programs.

==Exhibits==
The zoo&#x27;s collection totals nearly 1,100 animals.

===Walter Family Arctic Tundra===
Redeveloped from the former Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat in the zoo&#x27;s northeast corner, Walter Family Arctic Tundra is a new exhibit for the zoo&#x27;s polar bears, larger than the previous habitat with more land for the bears to roam on; instead of strict rockwork, there is natural grass, a new underwater viewing area, a maternity den, and enough space to support a small breeding family of bears.

===Robert and Mayari Pritzker Penguin Cove===
Linked to the nearby Regenstein African Journey, Penguin Cove is a new outdoor African penguin exhibit, where visitors can watch as these tropical penguins dive into the water, with a behind-the-scenes area for hatching chicks and breeding the species. The zoo also offers indoor Penguin Encounters. The exhibit opened to the public in October 2016.

===Regenstein Macaque Forest===
Opened in 2014, Macaque Forest is an exhibit allowing guests to connect with a troop of 10–15 Japanese macaques in a camouflaged forest scene with views from both above and eye-level with the animals. The exhibit features a &quot;hot spring&quot;, a trademark favorite of the species, which allows them to warm up in the winter and amuse guests. It also functions as a dedicated research station for the macaques. It is the zoo&#x27;s third exhibit to house primates.
*Japanese macaque
===Regenstein African Journey===
The Regenstein African Journey exhibit is a 60,000-square-foot indoor-and-outdoor exhibit which opened in May 2003 on the site of the zoo&#x27;s former Regenstein Large Mammal House. It simulates four distinct habitats from the African continent. Large skylights permit natural light into the indoor area, and guests are greeted quickly by monkeys in a rainforest setting as they enter Africa. The second section focuses on African rivers, with massive glass panels for hybrid land/water exhibits for West African dwarf crocodiles, pygmy hippos, and a Lake Malawi cichlid tank with an 11,000-lb., 7-in.-thick glass panel. The third section, focused on the African savanna, featured habitats for a large group of meerkats, a space for the zoo&#x27;s aardvarks, and an indoor habitat for the giraffes. The fourth and final section simulates African &quot;kopje&quot; habitats, with klipspringer antelopes hopping along the way.

The main outdoor exhibit is a large, expansive African savanna setting just outside the indoor exhibit exit that primarily houses the zoo&#x27;s giraffes. There is also a large yard for a family of African painted dogs, a hog yard that has been used by both common warthogs and currently red river hogs, and multiple yards for the zoo&#x27;s black rhinos. While many of these animals cannot be viewed indoors, they have access to indoor habitats year-round.

When the exhibit opened, it was also home to three African bush elephants, but they died, the last one dying at Hogle Zoo in 2005, sparking concerns about the exhibit. It later briefly held Bactrian camels, but it is currently an additional home for the zoo&#x27;s rhinos.

One noted resident of the exhibit was R1 (or Reptile One) the dwarf crocodile, who was seventy years old when he died in 2010, having lived within the zoo&#x27;s Reptile House (now Park Place Café), the Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House, and finally, Regenstein African Journey throughout his life.

===Regenstein Center for African Apes===

Lincoln Park Zoo&#x27;s dedication to primate research continued when the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House was closed and rebuilt with a new focus on the two African ape species, the chimpanzee and western lowland gorilla. The new center, opened in 2005, has over 29,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor living space for three ape troops, featuring dozens of trees, artificial vines, real and simulated bamboo, as well as skylights, waterfalls, moats, heated logs, and termite mounds for chimpanzees to illustrate their knowledge of tools to &#x27;fish&#x27; for termites in their mounds.

The exhibit has three spacious habitats—the 12,000-square-foot Kovler Gorilla Bamboo Forest, an open-air habitat with a moat around it, dedicated to the zoo&#x27;s main gorilla troop. Two additional exhibits—the Strangler Fig Forest and Dry Riverbed Valley—each with mesh netting to secure the animals, can accommodate either chimpanzees or gorillas. Huge glass panels give guests nose-to-nose access with the zoo&#x27;s apes both in the trees and on the ground. The exhibit also contains the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes, which encourages zoo guests to engage in research and scientific development to conserve apes in the wild.

Notable residents of this exhibit include Kwan, the current silverback in the zoo&#x27;s gorilla troupe who appeared in the film &quot;Return to Me&quot; as Sidney, a chimpanzee named Optimus Prime, after the fictional character of the same name, and formerly Keo, the oldest male chimpanzee in a North American zoo at the time of his death in September 2013 at fifty-five. Custom-made stuffed animals of Kwan and Optimus in their likenesses are available in the zoo&#x27;s Wild Things gift shop.

===Pritzker Family Children&#x27;s Zoo===
The new Pritzker Family Children&#x27;s Zoo, which opened in 2004, features a number of native eastern American wildlife, and lets visitors of all ages connect with the wild creatures in our own backyard and engages them to think about how species survive in the wilderness. Small amphibians and reptiles are featured in a small indoor exhibit, along with a leaf-themed climber play area for youngsters designed by Tom Luckey, with slightly larger indoor exhibits for birds and reptiles and large glass windows on each end so guests young and old can watch American beavers and the popular North American river otters swim gracefully underwater at eye-level in their outdoor habitats, with educational displays about how beavers build dams. Outside the building there are many areas where local birds nest. The building is surrounded by small outdoor viewing areas for the same otter and beaver habitats.

There are two significantly larger exhibits surrounding the path around the building for the American black bear and the endangered red wolf featuring heavy foliage and a naturalistic stream, allowing visitors to go eye-to-eye with the animals or for the animals to hide in the foliage. Statues of gray wolves and signs encourage guests to practice howling and teach them about wolf pack dynamics.

===Kovler Seal Pool===

One of the zoo&#x27;s most popular exhibits since its first iteration in 1879, the Kovler Seal Pool is one of oldest exhibits at Lincoln Park Zoo. It was renovated most recently in May 1999 in hopes of creating a habitat that most resembles their natural environment in the wild.

There are three main viewing areas—from behind a fence in front of the tank on the main zoo path, an amphitheater-style seating area above the tank on the opposite end, and an underwater viewing gallery where visitors can watch the seals glide through the water. The zoo&#x27;s pinnipeds are trained voluntarily twice a day, and given fish treats as rewards. Though multiple species of seal and sea lion have lived in the pool together in the past, since May 2013 it has been home only to gray and harbor seals.

===Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House===
The Regenstein Small Mammal-Reptile House is a indoor exhibit that opened in 1997 and houses small animals in two main areas: the Gallery and the Ecosystem. The Gallery begins with a large room ringed with terrariums exhibiting reptiles and amphibians. The next part of the Gallery features small mammals in and around a man-made baobab tree trunk. The building continues in the Ecosystem, a geodesic dome in height that simulates the world&#x27;s tropical rainforests. The Ecosystem begins with a series of stream exhibits for caimans and otters, and continues with mixed-species exhibits for arboreal species like primates.

===Regenstein Birds of Prey Exhibit===
This popular outdoor exhibit near McCormick Bird House allows visitors to observe powerful birds-of-prey through stunning outdoor aviaries that give them plenty of room to spread their wings or to perch on rocks or tree branches in their enclosures. These exhibits emphasize how birds-of-prey play a role as &quot;nature&#x27;s clean-up crew&quot;. One large, lush outdoor habitat contains multiple specimens, including breeding pairs of cinereous vultures and white stork, while two adjacent aviaries contain the zoo&#x27;s resident bald eagle and the next features a snowy owl next door. A baby vulture was born at the zoo in June 2013 but was abandoned by its parents and had to be hand-reared and reintroduced gradually.

===Helen Brach Primate House===

The zoo&#x27;s historic Primate House first opened in 1927, featuring apes and monkeys from different locations and habitats in a series of small, identical barred cages typical of most early zoo exhibits. It became famous for its apes, including a gorilla named Bushman, until the Great Ape House opened. The Primate House&#x27;s interior was heavily renovated in the early 1990s and it was re-opened as the Helen Brach Primate House in 1992 with eight diorama-style naturalistic exhibits simulating the swamps and rainforests of the animals&#x27; natural habitats in the wild. Perhaps its most notable residents are a family of white-cheeked gibbons that have a spacious room inside as well as an outdoor habitat for playing in the warm winter months. The zoo&#x27;s male and female gibbons gave birth to baby Daxin on August 16, 2013.

Crowned lemurs joined the exhibit in October 2013 from the Indianapolis Zoo and a baby lemur was born at the zoo on April 14, 2014.

===McCormick Bird House===
One of the zoo&#x27;s most historic buildings, the McCormick Bird House was first designed in 1904 under Cyrus DeVry, the zoo&#x27;s original director. It has been redesigned multiple times, most recently in 1991, and is currently home to multiple habitats recreating the tropics, savanna, sea shore, desert, wetlands, and other biomes, with a tropical free-flight aviary allowing guests to become immersed with perching and aquatic birds without fences or glass. Some of the zoo&#x27;s most notable birds include the famous laughing kookaburra in the scrub display, multiple scarlet ibis specimens in its swamp display and the Bali myna, a critically endangered bird that Lincoln Park Zoo breeds, while also maintaining the species&#x27; studbook. Thirty-one mynahs have been born at the zoo since 1972, with the most recent set of chicks being born in mid-2012.

===Camel &amp; Zebra Area===

The zoo&#x27;s 2.5 acre Camel &amp; Zebra Area, built in 1982 on the south end of the main zoo, is an oval-shaped series of large grassland exhibits that house the zoo&#x27;s diverse hoofstock and miscellaneous animals. During construction on Regenstein African Journey, it held the zoo&#x27;s future Grant&#x27;s gazelle collection. The Antelope &amp; Zebra Area has historically held several species, including the Arabian oryx, as part of the animals&#x27; complex Species Survival Plan, and briefly a pair of sable antelope in 2011. The most recent additions, however, are the waterbuck from Africa and a rarity in an American zoo, the endangered Sichuan takin.

The zoo has been successful with breeding the Sichuan takin—two baby takin were born together at the zoo in January and February 2013 and were named Xing Fu (&quot;happy good fortune&quot;) and Mengyao (&quot;superior handsomeness&quot;) after a poll on the Lincoln Park Zoo website. A baby kangaroo was born December 9, 2013, and later named Jack by nine-year-old Olivia Holness of Chicago.

===Waterfowl Lagoon===
A lagoon for waterfowl features the zoo&#x27;s familiar flock of almost fifty Chilean flamingos, who use the exhibit&#x27;s mudflaps to build nests and use the indoor Flamingo Habitat, sometimes referred to as the Flamingo Dome, during the winter to hide from the cold. It is also home to swan geese.

===Hope B. McCormick Swan Pond===
Lincoln Park Zoo began with the gift of a pair of swans, and to commemorate its founding and that special moment in history, a pair of trumpeter swans have continued to make their home at the zoo, now in the Hope B. McCormick Swan Pond, as a reminder of the zoo&#x27;s long history. Several diverse species of waterfowl call this pond home.

===Farm-in-the-Zoo===
The Farm-in-the-Zoo Presented by John Deere is across the South Pond from the rest of the zoo, and is designed to &quot;give Chicago Kids a chance to experience a bit of the country in the city.&quot; Opened in 1964, it exhibits pigs, cows, horses and other domestic animals. Visitors can pet and feed the animals and roam vegetable gardens. Each day, the cows are milked in public and staff are on hand to explain other elements of farm life. Interactive exhibits allow guests to &quot;hatch&quot; from an egg, learn about farm weather, and about gardening.

===Pepper Family Wildlife Center===
A historic zoo landmark first built in 1912, the Kovler Lion House building stands at the heart of the zoo near its entrance, and has housed a variety of big cat species over the years, most notably many lions as well as Siberian tigers, which inhabited two grottos on the northern exterior of the building, each having access to multiple indoor areas alongside the interior main hall, and a glass window viewing areas on the end of each grotto for guests to get a closer view. Other big cats, such as the jaguar, were allowed rotating access to two to three indoor window exhibits at a time. The southern exterior included five lush habitats that housed a variety of different cat species over the years. In addition, they also held a pair of red pandas, which were part of the Species Survival Plan. The indoor area also has a large gift shop where visitors can purchase plush toys of big cats, bears, and other animals.

Many of the species in the southern habitats shifted over the years, including Amur leopards, Eurasian lynxes, a Pallas&#x27;s cat, and a puma in the exhibit&#x27;s later years, with the last major addition being a one-year-old snow leopard named Taza who arrived on December 11, 2014.

One of the exhibit&#x27;s notable residents was Adelor the African lion, who lived at the zoo from 1995 until his death in February 2012 and was one of the zoo&#x27;s most popular animals. Upon his death, an anonymous donor paid for a statue of Adelor which now stands at the East Gate. He was succeeded by a male lion named Sahar, who turned four in January 2014. Another notable individual was a beloved black leopard, Marta, who was euthanized due to kidney problems in 2010. The zoo was also once known for having some of the only Asiatic lions in the United States, but these were later found to have received African-Asian hybrids.

In 2016, the zoo announced a $30 million renovation of the habitat as part of the Pride of Chicago fundraising campaign, acknowledging the public perception problems of the historic building, and confirming that the focus would be a more naturalistic space for African lions, along with spaces for the Canada lynx, Snow leopards, and red pandas. The exhibit closed in 2019 for the renovation and reopened as the Pepper Family Wildlife Center in the fall of 2021.

On March 15/16, 2022, a male lion cub was born following a 3 to 4-month gestation period. The cub is named Pilipili, meaning Pepper in Swahili language, and he is the offspring of lioness Zari and male Jabari. It was the zoo&#x27;s first lion cub birth in 20 years. Three additional lion cubs were born January 9, 2023 to the same African lion pairing, bringing the total number of lions in the pride up to eight.

===Bear Habitat===

The Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat, or &quot;Bear Line&quot;, sat directly next to Regenstein African Journey, and housed many carnivores over the years in a number of naturalistic exhibits with trees, water falls, rocky grottos and climbing structures for bears and wolves to use. At the north end is the 266,000-gallon polar bear pool and underwater window, one of the largest polar bear habitats in the world. The zoo received two polar bears, brother and sister Lee and Anana, in 2001, but currently only Anana remains, as Lee was sent to the Detroit Zoo to assist in a breeding program. The only other remaining member of the bear line is a single Malayan sun bear. The zoo was also home to two elderly spectacled bears, Goliath and Manny that have since been sent to another zoo, as have the spotted hyenas. The exhibit used to house the maned wolf and Mexican wolf but both species were removed when the Pritzer Family Children&#x27;s Zoo opened its own red wolf habitat in 2005.

The exhibit closed in winter 2014 as work began on the new polar bear and penguin habitats over the same site. The habitat re-opened in late 2016.

===Penguin-Seabird Exhibit===
First opened in 1981/1982, the zoo&#x27;s historic Aquatic Bird House featured two main theater-style galleries. The first featured three species of penguin—the rockhopper, chinstrap and king penguins, all in an 18,000-gallon, temperature-controlled pool, with a chilly temperature of around forty degrees Fahrenheit for the air and water, while a computer system imitates the natural daylight cycle penguins experience in the wild. The second gallery featured tufted puffins, common murres and razorbills swimming in a 10,000-gallon pool based on the North Atlantic coast, where the birds made their homes on rocky cliffs. The historic building closed on December 5, 2011, and has been replaced with Regenstein Macaque Forest. The sixty-six birds that lived in the previous exhibit were moved to eleven other locations, including the Shedd Aquarium, the St. Louis Zoo, the Detroit Zoo, the Central Park Zoo and the Oregon Coast Aquarium A new African penguin habitat was built by the current site of the Robert McCormick Bear Habitat, and opened in 2016.

<text>In telecommunications, a guard band is a narrow, intentionally unused frequency band that is placed between adjacent frequency bands to minimize interference between them. It is used in frequency-division multiplexing. Guard bands exist in both wired and wireless communications.

A guard band can also be licensed for use by low-powered devices such as a private mobile phone network.

<text>The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in Palm Springs, California, is the largest rotating aerial tramway in the world. It was opened in September 1963 as a way of getting from the floor of the Coachella Valley to near the top of San Jacinto Peak and was constructed in rugged Chino Canyon. Before its construction, the only way to the top of the mountain was to hike hours from Idyllwild. The rotating cars were added in 2000.

==Route==
The twelve-and-a-half minute ride begins at the Valley Station (coordinates: ) at and passes up a sheer mountain face through five life zones (biomes) on its way to the Mountain Station (coordinates: ) at above sea level. Travelers start in the Sonoran Desert and arrive at an alpine forest.

The floor of the aerial tram cars rotates constantly, making two complete revolutions throughout the duration of the journey so that the passengers can see in all directions without moving. With a maximum capacity of 80 passengers, it is the largest of the four rotating aerial trams in the world. The other &quot;Rotair&quot; aerial trams are located in Cape Town, South Africa, Titlis, Switzerland and Sky Way, Courmayeur, Italy.

Passengers disembark at the 
Mountain Station in the alpine wilderness of Long Valley and Mount San Jacinto State Park. The air can be as much as 40 °F (22 °C) cooler at the top than in the desert. Visitors can walk along nature trails or play in the snow in the winter months. Back-country hiking can be done with a permit from the U.S. Forest Service. There are two restaurants at the summit, one of which specializes in fine dining. Both stations have gift shops specializing in Aerial Tramway-related merchandise as well as educational toys. A video presentation of the history of the attraction plays continuously in a theater at the Mountain Station. It was produced by Palm Springs television station KESQ-TV with voiceovers provided by Palm Springs radio personalities.

The view at the top can stretch northward for more than on a clear day, all the way to Mount Charleston north of Las Vegas, Nevada. Views to the east and west can stretch as far as . California&#x27;s Salton Sea is plainly visible to the southeast.

As it was in 1963, the only way up the mountain to deliver supplies and water is via the aerial tram cars themselves. Supplies are loaded into the passenger area before the attraction&#x27;s opening while fresh water is pumped into storage tanks in the car&#x27;s underbelly.
The original aerial tram cars are now on static display near the entrance to the Valley Station.

== History ==

The aerial tram was first proposed by electrical engineer Francis Freeman Crocker (1901-1992) during a 1935 trip to Banning, California, with the &quot;Desert Sun&quot; newspaper publisher Carl Barkow. During the heat of the day, Crocker&#x27;s gaze fell upon the snow-capped, peak of Mount San Jacinto to the east. Crocker then proposed building an aerial tram up the face of Chino Canyon, an idea that one newspaper dubbed &quot;Crocker&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

Toward the end of the decade, Crocker named the comanager of the Palm Springs Desert Inn, O. Earl Coffman, to chair the construction committee.
Both World War II and the Korean War shelved the project. Construction began in 1960. The unprecedented use of helicopters in the construction of four of the aerial tram&#x27;s five towers helped the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway earn a reputation as a great engineering feat. It was opened in September 1963.

In 1963, a tram car became stuck for 13½ hours because of an electrical problem in the control room.

In June 1984, a tram car was headed down the mountain when a bolt from a shock absorber snapped, causing a piece of metal to crash through a Plexiglas window along the car&#x27;s roof. Tram passenger Elaine Tseko of Ontario, California, was struck by the piece and later died as a result of the injury.

In September 1984, during routine maintenance, an auxiliary cable snapped and wrapped around the main cable tracks. &quot;The Desert Sun&quot; newspaper reported that if the broken cable hadn&#x27;t wedged itself under the main track cables, a rescue car with the tram&#x27;s workmen in it could have plummeted down the mountain into the lower tramway station. &quot;Without the snag,&quot; a state investigator said, &quot;those two men wouldn&#x27;t be with us today.&quot;

In 1985, a flash flood buried vehicles parked in the Valley Station&#x27;s parking lot in mud and tore up about three-quarters of a mile of Tramway Road. Stranded passengers had to be airlifted from the area.

Not all Tramway accidents happened on the passenger lifts. On July 31, 1991, a bus carrying approximately 60 Girl Scouts careened out of control as it was heading downhill on Tram Road, killing the driver and six passengers.

In 2000, the original tram cars were replaced by new cars that rotate slowly, offering riders a 360° panoramic view of Chino Canyon and the desert valley floor.

In October 2003, a steel cable broke and caused a mechanical failure that left more than fifty tramway customers hanging in mid-air and one hundred passengers stranded at the Mountain station for 4½ hours. During the crisis, tramway officials sought a rescue helicopter but could not locate one. The obstruction was removed by a tram operator with no training in maintenance, utilizing a borrowed Leatherman utility knife. &quot;The Desert Sun&quot; later reported that a cable inspector had discovered a break in the rescue line almost two hours before the incident occurred.

== Animal park ==
In the late 1960s, the Tramway Animal Park, now defunct, was owned and operated by Animal Behavior Laboratories of Los Angeles. It was located on of land leased from the Mt. San Jacinto Winter Park Authority. A portion of the park included a fenced area for reindeer that were allowed to roam throughout Chino Canyon. In addition to reindeer, the park featured tame deer, cockatoos, two dolphins named Buttons and Beau, macaques, and various other species of primates (including &quot;Suzie, the show-off chimpanzee&quot;). The animals performed in regularly scheduled shows.

== Station architecture ==

Both tramway stations were designed by notable mid-century modern architects. The Valley Station, finished in 1963, was designed by Albert Frey and Robson C. Chambers. The Mountain Station, built in 1961, was designed by architect E. Stewart Williams. Additionally, the distinctive Tramway Gas Station at the foot of Tramway Road was designed by Frey and Chambers.

== In popular culture ==
The tramway has been featured in many films and television programs since its inception. 

In the fall of 1966, two episodes of &quot;I Spy&quot; were filmed in Palm Springs, one of which included footage of the tramway (Season 2, Episode 1), and the other included a brief discussion of the tramway (Season 2, Episode 8).

On September 16, 1967, the first episode of the TV show &quot;Mannix&quot; was broadcast with the tramway as a scene in the show. 

The fourth and final &quot;Matt Helm&quot; movie, &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, contained an action scene filmed at the tram station that featured actors Dean Martin, Nancy Kwan, and Sharon Tate. 

On October 2, 1971, an episode of &quot;&quot; (Season 6, Episode 3: &quot;The Tram&quot;), filmed at the tramway, first aired. 

The 1972 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Short Fuse&quot; featured the tramway as the location of the climactic scene at the end of the show where Columbo tricks the murderer into revealing his guilt. 

The 1974 television movie &quot;Skyway to Death&quot;, shown on the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;, had its exterior scenes filmed at the tramway. 

In the 2010 &quot;Life After People&quot; episode &quot;Holiday Hell&quot;, the dry desert environment allows the tramway to survive for 120 years without maintenance; however, corrosion eventually sets in on the cable and towers, leading it to collapse into Chino Canyon.

<text>Thorotrast is a suspension containing particles of the radioactive compound thorium dioxide, ThO2; it was used as a radiocontrast agent in clinical radiography in the 1930s to 1950s. It is no longer used clinically.

Thorium compounds produce excellent images because of thorium&#x27;s high opacity to X-rays (it has a high cross section for absorption). However, thorium is retained in the body, and it is radioactive, emitting harmful alpha radiation as it decays. Because the suspension offered high image quality and had virtually no immediate side-effects compared to the alternatives available at the time, Thorotrast became widely used after its introduction in 1931. António Egas Moniz contributed to its development. About 2 to 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with Thorotrast. However, today it has shown to increase risk of certain cancers, such as cholangiocarcinomas, angiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, and fibrosis of the liver.

==Safety==
Even at the time of introduction, there was concern about the safety of Thorotrast. Following injection, the drug is distributed to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone, where it is absorbed. After this initial absorption, redistribution takes place at a very slow pace. Specifically, the biological half-life is estimated to be 22 years. This means that the organs of patients who have been given Thorotrast will be exposed to internal alpha radiation for the rest of their lives. The significance of this long-term exposure was not fully understood at the time of Thorotrast&#x27;s introduction in 1931.

Thorotrast has significant effects in the liver due to its hepatic accumulation. It is linked to the development of liver fibrosis, liver cancer and peliosis hepatis.

Due to the release of alpha particles, Thorotrast was found to be extremely carcinogenic. There is a high over-incidence of various cancers in patients who have been treated with Thorotrast. The cancers occur some years (usually 20–30) after injection of Thorotrast. The risk of developing liver cancer (or bile duct cancer) in former Thorotrast patients has been measured to be well above 100 times the risk of the rest of the population. The risk of leukemia appears to be 20 times higher in Thorotrast patients. Thorotrast exposure has also been associated with the development of angiosarcoma.

German patients exposed to Thorotrast had their median life-expectancy shortened by 14 years in comparison to a similar non-exposed control group. Epidemiological studies from Portugal where Thorotrast was in use between 1930 and 1955 showed that the link between it and the risk of developing leukaemia was significant, and went so far as describing Thorotrast as the most potent leukaemogen reported. The studies also noted very high levels of haemangioendotheliomas typically of the liver and that they were very rarely seen in controls.

Thorium is no longer used in clinical X-ray studies. Today, hydrophilic (water-soluble) iodinated contrast agents, which are not radioactive, are universally used intravenously in clinical X-ray procedures.

The Danish director Nils Malmros&#x27;s movie, &quot;Facing the Truth&quot; (original Danish title ) from 2002, portrays the dilemma that faced Malmros&#x27;s father, Richard Malmros, when treating his patients in the 1940s. Richard Malmros was deeply concerned about the persistence of Thorotrast in the body but was forced to use Thorotrast, because the only available alternative (per-abrodil) had serious immediate side-effects, suffered from image quality problems and was difficult to obtain during the Second World War. The use of Thorotrast in Denmark ended in 1947 when safer alternatives became available.

==Current use==
In the decades after the cessation of its clinical use, Thorotrast has sometimes been used in laboratory research to stain neural tissue samples for examination by historadiography.

<text>Kenneth George Aston, MBE (1 September 1915 – 23 October 2001) was an English teacher, soldier, and football referee, who was responsible for many important developments in football refereeing - including the yellow and red penalty card system.

== Early life and career ==

Born in Colchester, Essex, he graduated from St Luke&#x27;s College, Exeter (in which George Reader had been taught just after the First World War, and which Sir Stanley Rous had also attended). He qualified as a referee in 1936, working his way through the leagues becoming a Football League linesman in the 1949–50 season, and becoming a League referee. In the Second World War he was rejected by the Royal Air Force because of an injured ankle, and subsequently joined the Royal Artillery before transferring to the British Indian Army, where he finished the war with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and served on the Changi War Crimes Tribunal.

== Refereeing ==

On his return from military service in 1946, Aston became the first League referee to wear the black uniform with white trim which became the standard for referees. Up to that point, referees wore tweed jackets over white shirts with French cuffs, and pants akin to golf knickers. He later explained that when he spied a black flight jacket in the window of a war surplus store, he was delighted with the wonderful assortment of pockets. He immediately bought a couple of the jackets, thinking the pockets would serve him well as a referee. He changed to black knickers, kept the white shirt, and wore the new black flight jacket, creating the black uniform with the apparent white &quot;trim.&quot;

The following year (1947), he introduced brightly coloured linesman&#x27;s flags, one yellow and one red, in place of those provided by the home team, in the home team&#x27;s colours, which had traditionally been used. He explained that he was doing a game in the midst of a foggy London day. He said that the colours of the home team were beige and chocolate, colours he was unable to see in the fog. He explained that he went to war surplus store on the way home, purchased a pair of red and yellow rain slickers and made a set of brightly coloured flags, which he used thereafter, and was never troubled by fog again.

In 1953 he became Head Teacher at Newbury Park Primary School in Ilford, Essex, and progressed to refereeing senior League matches.

Aston taught many courses, including a series that was recorded for novice referees. He called the series, &quot;Refereeing is thinking.&quot;

Aston refereed the 1963 FA Cup Final and the &quot;Battle of Santiago&quot;, the match between Chile and Italy in the 1962 World Cup.

== FIFA Referees&#x27; Committee ==

Aston did not referee any more games either in the 1962 tournament (having strained his Achilles Tendon), or in later World Cups. He was, however, appointed to the FIFA Referees&#x27; Committee for eight years, chairing it for four. He was in charge of all referees for the 1966, 1970, and 1974 World Cups.

In 1966 Aston also introduced the practice of naming a referee who could take over in the case of the referee being unable to continue for any reason (this eventually evolved into the practice of having a designated fourth official).

He also successfully proposed that the pressure of the ball should be specified in the Laws of the Game. In 1974, he introduced the number board for substitutes, so that players could easily understand who was being substituted.

He was also credited for the improvement of refereeing beginning with the World cup 1970 in Mexico through his efforts to bring about uniformity.

== Red and yellow cards ==

Following an incident in the England vs Argentina match in the 1966 World Cup, it came to Aston&#x27;s knowledge that Jack Charlton had been booked by the German referee, Rudolf Kreitlein. Charlton called the press office, where Aston was ensconced (as Head of World Cup Referees), in order to confirm the information that he had read within the newspaper that Kreitlein had booked him. Aston, driving from Wembley Stadium to Lancaster Gate that same evening, had Charlton&#x27;s confusion in mind during the journey.

On the trip, as he stopped at a traffic light junction at Kensington High Street, Aston realised that a colour-coding scheme based on the same amber/yellow (&#x27;stop if safe to do so&#x27;) - red (Stop) principle as used on traffic lights would traverse language barriers and clarify to players and spectators that they had been cautioned or sent off.

Aston later explained that upon arriving at his home, he explained the dilemma to his wife, Hilda. She disappeared into the other room, only to return a few minutes later with two &quot;cards&quot; made of construction paper. She had cut them to fit into his shirt pocket. Thus was devised the system whereby referees show a yellow card for a caution and a red card for an expulsion, which was first used in the 1970 World Cup.

These cards have also been adopted – with appropriate differences depending on the rules – in rugby, water polo, and other sports.

== Later career ==

Aston became senior lecturer of the Football Association Referees&#x27; Panel and Chief Instructor for the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), a position he held for 21 years. In 1997, he was awarded the MBE.

The Ken Aston Camp is held annually in Orange, CA. The camp honours Ken&#x27;s commitment to service and excellence. The Ken Aston Cup, was an annual competition to recognise skilled referees in AYSO. The tournament was held annually in southern California. As long as they were able, Aston and his wife Hilda were the guests of honour on the fields at the camp and competition. Ken taught at the camp and they drove around the tournament in a golf cart, observing, chatting, and making new friends. Their golf cart carried a Union Jack, making them easy to locate.

After a multi-year hiatus, it was scheduled to be held in Costa Mesa, California in March 2020.

<text>SSTH &quot;Ocean Arrow&quot; is a super slender twin hull (SSTH) car ferry operating in Japan. Prof. Hideaki Miyata at Tokyo University developed the SSTH, a high-speed catamaran-hulled boat, as a joint work with IHI Corporation.

It entered service in 1998 between Kumamoto and Shimabara. The trip takes about 30 minutes, or about half the time that it had previously taken.

Despite their prevalence in Europe, previous attempts to bring a fast ferry to Japan had failed due to wake wash and wave damage in the Japanese coastal areas. In Ireland, a swimmer was drowned in one instance which was thought to be caused by wake wash from a fast-moving ferry.

<text>Alicia Coppola (born April 12, 1968) is an American actress. She became known for playing Lorna Devon in the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; from 1991 to 1994. Afterwards, she made regular and guest star appearances in various television series, notably &quot;Jericho&quot; and &quot;Blood &amp; Treasure&quot;, and appeared in films such as &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;.

==Early life==
Coppola was born and raised in Huntington, Long Island, New York. In 1990, she graduated from New York University with a degree in philosophy and anthropology. She originally planned to attend law school, but instead went into modeling, signing with Elite Modeling Agency.

Coppola is not related to the Coppola film family.

==Career==
Coppola began her television career as a hostess on the MTV game show &quot;Remote Control&quot;.

In 1991, Coppola joined the cast of the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, playing the vixen Lorna Devon, the long-lost daughter of popular character Felicia Gallant. She played the role until 1994.

Coppola&#x27;s better-known TV jobs have included a recurring role on &quot;Trinity&quot; (1998–99), a starring role on the American remake of the British comedy &quot;Cold Feet&quot; (1999), and top billing on the TNT drama &quot;Bull&quot; (2000). She played Leesa in a 1999 episode of &quot;Sports Night&quot;, appeared briefly as Betazoid Lt. Stadi in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, played a cannibalistic murderer on &quot;&quot;, a widow who marries her late husband&#x27;s killer on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, and appeared several times as JAG lawyer Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman on &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot; (she also appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot;, but as a different character). In 2003, she starred alongside Gary Oldman and Ving Rhames in the film &quot;Sin&quot;, and played a Hollywood rehab stereotype by the name of Toni Stark on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. She played a power company public relations representative in a 2004 episode of &quot;Monk&quot;. Coppola also took on the unusual role of a female serial killer agreeing to help catch her copycat in the 2005 episode of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; titled &quot;Road Kill&quot;. She had a recurring role on NBC&#x27;s &quot;American Dreams&quot;, playing the role of Nancy.

Coppola had a role as a Muslim intelligence analyst working for the Los Angeles branch of the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), in a single episode of &quot;24&quot;, named Azara (&quot;1–2 am&quot; during Day 4). All four of her scenes were cut from the broadcast episode, but are restored as extras on the Day 4 DVD. In them, she discovers a lead in the investigation which is originally dismissed by fellow analyst Edgar Stiles, who suspects her because of her religion. Edgar later apologizes to her when her lead turns out to be important.

Starting in the fall of 2006, Coppola appeared in the recurring role of IRS Agent Mimi Clark in the post-apocalyptic drama &quot;Jericho&quot;. She became a series regular in February 2007. She was an FBI agent in &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;, also directed by &quot;Jericho&quot; executive producer Jon Turteltaub.

She appeared in the MTV series &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; as the powerful Alpha werewolf Talia Hale.

In 2014, Coppola appeared on &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; as Mildred Treal in the episode &quot;Faith and Despondency&quot;. She returned to daytime soap operas for the first time in twenty years when she took a recurring role on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in spring 2016. Coppola appeared as Dr. Tammy Brunner in a 2017 episode of &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;.

<doc id="716083" wikidata="Q5254083" url="?curid=716083" title="Delivery point">
<text>In a postal system, a delivery point (sometimes DP) is a single mailbox or other place at which mail is delivered. It differs from a street address, in that each address may have several delivery points, such as an apartment, office department, or other room. Such buildings (primarily residential) are often called multiple-dwelling units (MDUs) by the USPS.

==United States Postal Service usage==
In the US Postal System, a delivery point is a specific set of digits between 00 and 99 assigned to every address. When combined with the ZIP + 4 code, the delivery point provides a unique identifier for every deliverable address served by the USPS.

The delivery point digits are almost never printed on mail in human-readable form; instead they are encoded in the POSTNET delivery point barcode (DPBC) or as part of the newer Intelligent Mail Barcode (IMb). The DPBC makes automated mail sorting possible, including ordering the mail according to how the carrier delivers it (walk sequence).

The two-digit delivery point number is combined with an additional check digit in the DPBC. This digit is used by barcode sorters (BCS) to check if the ZIP, ZIP+4, or delivery point ZIP codes contain an error. In a database, storing the ZIP+4 code in a 10 character field (with the hyphen) allows easy output in the address block, and storing the check digit in a 3-digit field (instead of calculating it) allows automatic checking of the validity of the ZIP+4 and delivery point fields in case one had been changed independently. In order to receive the appropriate barcode discount, the delivery point digits and the +4 extension must be verified using an up-to-date, CASS or Delivery Point Validation (DPV) certified program.

Since each city block or section of a rural route has a different +4 extension, and address numbers generally increase by 100 per block, the delivery point is typically the last two digits of the address. In the early days of DPBC, it was acceptable to determine the delivery point in this fashion, but since suite and other secondary designations are assigned unique delivery points which cannot be determined without the CASS/DPV database, this is no longer possible. The delivery point is usually redundant for post office boxes, since they are typically assigned their own ZIP+4 code, but must nonetheless be assigned a complete DPBC for full postal discounts. The full rules for identifying the delivery point for a given address are specified in the USPS CASS Technical Guide.

==United Kingdom== 

In the United Kingdom the delivery point index is known as the Postcode Address File (PAF). It is owned and made available by Royal Mail.

==New Zealand Post==
New Zealand Post maintains an index of delivery points known as the National Postal Address Database (NPAD). 
==Australia Post==
In Australia the PAF is maintained by Australia Post.

<doc id="716091" wikidata="Q1136370" url="?curid=716091" title="General Hospital">
<text>General Hospital (often abbreviated as GH) is an American daytime television soap opera. It is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running American soap opera in production, and the second in American history after &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Concurrently, it is the world&#x27;s third-longest-running scripted drama series in production after British serials &quot;The Archers&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, as well as the world&#x27;s second-longest-running televised soap opera still in production. &quot;General Hospital&quot; premiered on the ABC television network on April 1, 1963. &quot;General Hospital&quot; is the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood, and the longest-running entertainment program in ABC television history. It holds the record for most Daytime Emmy Awards for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, with 14 wins.

The show was created by husband-and-wife soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, who originally set it in a hospital, in an unnamed fictional city. In the 1970s, the city was named Port Charles, New York. From its beginning, &quot;General Hospital&quot; starred John Beradino and Emily McLaughlin, and both actors stayed with the show until their deaths in 1996 and 1991, respectively. They were joined a year later by Rachel Ames who remains to date the longest-serving actress on an ABC soap opera, having been continuously on the show from 1964 to 2007. &quot;General Hospital&quot; was the second soap to air on ABC (after the short-lived &quot;Road to Reality&quot;, which aired for several months during the 1960–61 season). In 1964, a sister soap was created for &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot;; it ran for two years and was canceled because of low ratings. &quot;General Hospital&quot; also spawned the daytime series &quot;Port Charles&quot; (1997–2003) and the primetime spin-off &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; (2007–2008). Taped at The Prospect Studios, &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired for a half-hour until July 23, 1976. The series was expanded from 30 minutes to 45 minutes on July 26, 1976, and then to a full hour on January 16, 1978.

Ever since the late 1970s, most of the storylines have revolved around the Quartermaine family and the Spencer family. From 1979 to 1988, &quot;General Hospital&quot; had more viewers than any other daytime soap opera. It rose to the top of the ratings in the early 1980s in part thanks to the monumentally popular &quot;supercouple&quot; Luke and Laura, whose 1981 wedding brought in 30 million viewers and remains the highest-rated hour in American soap opera history. The soap opera is also known for its high-profile celebrity guest stars who have included, among others, Roseanne Barr, James Franco and Elizabeth Taylor. In 2007, the program was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-Time&quot;. On April 23, 2009, &quot;General Hospital&quot; began broadcasting in high-definition television, making it the first ABC soap opera to make such a transition.

&quot;General Hospital&quot; became the oldest American soap opera on September 17, 2010, following the final broadcast of CBS&#x27; &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. On April 14, 2011, ABC announced the cancellation of both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, leaving &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the last remaining soap opera airing on the network after January 13, 2012. The show celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2013, and its 15,000th episode on June 22, 2022.

==Show history==

===Origins===
&quot;General Hospital&quot; was created by Frank and Doris Hursley and premiered on April 1, 1963, replacing the canceled game show &quot;Yours for a Song&quot;. The first stories were mainly set on the seventh floor of General Hospital, in an unnamed midsize Eastern city (the name of the city, Port Charles, would not be mentioned until the late 1970s by headwriters Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock.). &quot;They had this concept of the show that it was like a big wagon wheel—the spokes would be the characters and the hub would be the hospital&quot;, John Beradino (Steve Hardy) later reflected to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1994.

===History===

Launched in 1963, the first stories were mainly set at General Hospital in an unnamed midsized Eastern city. Storylines revolved around Steve Hardy (John Beradino) and his friend, Nurse Jessie Brewer (Emily McLaughlin). Jessie&#x27;s turbulent marriage to the much-younger Phil Brewer (originally portrayed by Roy Thinnes; lastly by Martin West) was the center of many early storylines. In 1964 Audrey Hardy (Rachel Ames), a flight attendant and sister of Nurse Lucille (Lucille Wall), came to town, and was the woman who won Steve&#x27;s heart.

By the end of the 1970s, &quot;General Hospital&quot; was facing dire ratings when executive producer Gloria Monty was brought in to turn the show around. Monty is credited with creation of the first supercouple, Luke and Laura, played by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis. The end of their hour wedding on November 17, 1981, was the most-watched event in daytime serial history. During the 1980s, the series featured several high-profile action, adventure, and some science fiction-based storylines. Location shooting at sites including Mount Rushmore in South Dakota; Niagara Falls; Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Big Bear and Avalon (Catalina Island), California; and San Antonio, Texas are some that propelled the story.

After Gloria Monty first left the series in 1987, &quot;General Hospital&quot; entered into a transitional phase that lasted until Wendy Riche took the position of executive producer in 1992. Under Riche, the show gained critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of social issues. In 1994, Riche started an annual Nurses&#x27; Ball, a fundraiser and HIV/AIDS awareness event both on the show and in real life. Later that year, a heart transplantation storyline involves the death of eight-year-old (daughter of Dr. Tony Jones and Bobbie Spencer) in a bus crash and the subsequent donation of her heart to her dying cousin Maxie Jones. Shortly afterwards, Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) begins a long battle with breast cancer, which leads to her adopting Emily Quartermaine, the orphaned young daughter of Monica&#x27;s friend from treatment. &quot;General Hospital&quot; was also praised for the love story of teenagers Stone Cates (Michael Sutton) and Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). After a struggle that lasted throughout most of 1995, Stone dies from AIDS at the age of 19 and his death is followed by 17-year-old Robin having to deal with being HIV-positive as a result of their relationship. Sutton received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and McCullough won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series award. ABC featured an Afterschool Special &quot;Positive: A Journey Into AIDS&quot; revolving around the AIDS story as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot; best selling novel &quot;Robin&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

On Saturday, December 14, 1996, &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired its one of three primetime episodes, &quot;General Hospital: Twist of Fate&quot;, which picked up where that Friday&#x27;s episode had left off. The special centered on Laura&#x27;s supposed death at the hands of Stefan Cassadine. In 1997, the show&#x27;s long-rumored spin-off materialized into the half-hour serial, &quot;Port Charles&quot;. The series&#x27; 11,000th episode aired on February 20, 2006. On April 23, 2009, &quot;General Hospital&quot; became ABC&#x27;s first regular daytime drama to be taped and broadcast in High-definition television, though the 2008 season of its primetime spinoff &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; was in high definition. This is the second daytime drama to move to high definition after CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. On February 23, 2010, the series aired its 12,000th episode. On December 1, 2011, ABC confirmed that former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; executive producer Frank Valentini and head writer Ron Carlivati would replace longtime executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and Garin Wolf, respectively, though Wolf would remain on as a regular writer. The change took effect on January 9, 2012. The first episode under the direction of Valentini aired on February 1, 2012, with Carlivati&#x27;s material beginning on February 21. Several storylines reminiscent of iconic story arcs of the past were created and popular characters returned to the show in order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the series in 2013. The serial celebrated 13,000 episodes on February 24, 2014, and marked its 51st anniversary several weeks later on April 1. Also in January 2014, ABC renewed Carlivati&#x27;s contract with the soap. The series marked its 52nd anniversary on April 1, 2015, with a special episode revolving around the Spencer family.

In July 2015, it was revealed Carlivati was fired as head writer; Shelly Altman and Jean Passanante were hired as his successors. On September 16, 2016, &quot;Daytime Confidential&quot; reported that Valentini, Passanante and Altman re-signed with the show. On June 6, 2017, Passanante announced her decision to retire from the serial. On July 29, 2017, it was revealed through Passanante that breakdown writer Chris Van Etten would be promoted to co-head writer as her successor. On February 23, 2018, the serial aired its 14,000th episode. On July 30, 2019, Altman announced her retirement; breakdown writer Dan O&#x27;Connor was named as her successor, joining Van Etten as co-head writer. On June 22, 2022, the soap aired its 15,000 episode; in celebration, the episode focused on Francis&#x27; Laura Spencer.

On January 22, 2024, it was announced Van Etten and O&#x27;Connor had been dismissed from their positions as co-head writers; former associate head writer Patrick Mulcahey and present script editor Elizabeth Korte were named as their replacements. Per reports, material from the former regime aired into March 2024. Five months later, it was announced Mulcahey had been dismissed from his position as head writer. Mulcahey&#x27;s final credited episode aired on August 6; the following day, it was announced Van Etten would resume the role of co-head writer credit, with Cathy LePard named as associate head writer.

===Production===

&quot;General Hospital&quot; has aired on the ABC television network and has been filmed in Hollywood since its inception. The show was filmed in the Sunset Gower Studios from 1963 to the mid-1980s. It relocated in the 1980s to The Prospect Studios.

&quot;General Hospital&quot; has had a number of different distributors throughout the show&#x27;s history. From its beginning until 1968, it was a co-production of Plitt Theatres and Selmur Productions. ABC bought the series outright in 1968 and its ownership passed from Selmur to American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., ABC&#x27;s old separate conglomerate. Ownership of the soap was then passed in 1986 to Capital Cities/ABC, which was formed after the acquisition of ABC by a smaller media concern, Capital Cities Communications. The Walt Disney Company bought Capital Cities/ABC in 1996, and Disney has held ownership of the soap since then.

Production of &quot;General Hospital&quot; was suspended in March 2020, as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Production resumed on July 22 of the same year; new episodes began airing on August 3, 2020. &quot;General Hospital&quot; was Disney&#x27;s first series to go back into production during the pandemic.

==Cast==

===Characters===

Though the series originally focused on solely the medical staff at Port Charles&#x27; General Hospital, and starred John Beradino as Dr. Steve Hardy and Emily McLaughlin as Nurse Jessie Brewer, the series branched out and began to focus more on the people and families of the town of Port Charles rather than those solely in the hospital.

Port Charles is full of &quot;dysfunctional family dynamics ... and family drama remains the focal point of this town.&quot; The current families on the show include the quarreling and wealthy Quartermaine family, the mobster crime Corinthos family, the middle class Scorpio/Jones family, the aristocratic Cassadine family, and the adventurous Spencer family.

==Setting==
Since the series began in 1963, Port Charles, New York, has been the setting for the show. The town exists in the same fictional universe as other soap opera settings such as Llanview (&quot;One Life to Live&quot;), Pine Valley (&quot;All My Children&quot;), New York City (&quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;), and Corinth (&quot;Loving&quot;). The same setting was also used for &quot;General Hospital&quot; spinoff, &quot;Port Charles&quot;.

* General Hospital is founded by Dr. Steve Hardy. It is a major employer in the city, and one of the largest medical facilities on the East Coast. In the 1990s, Sonny Corinthos donates an extra wing dedicated to AIDS research, and in the 2000s, Carly Corinthos donates a pediatric center for head neurology. In 2009, a fire destroys the hospital, which is rebuilt with money from the Quartermaine family.
* The Metro Court is a prominent hotel in Port Charles, built by Jasper Jacks on the site of the Port Charles Hotel after it is destroyed in a fire in 2004, and named in honor of Courtney Matthews, who Jax was pursuing romantically. Carly Corinthos soon becomes his business partner, and later co-owns with Kate Howard when Jax sells his portion to her. The hotel boasts a skyline restaurant, spa, penthouse suites, and business offices. The current owners are Carly and Olivia Falconeri.
* Kelly&#x27;s Diner is founded by Joe &quot;Paddy&quot; Kelly, and becomes a vintage restaurant in the heart of Port Charles. It features boarding rooms upstairs which become homes to many Port Charles residents and guests over the years. The restaurant is operated by Paddy&#x27;s wife Rose Kelly after his death, who later sells it to Ruby Anderson when Rose leaves town. When Ruby dies, she leaves the diner to her niece Bobbie Spencer and nephew Luke Spencer.
* The Haunted Star is a yacht first owned by Luke Spencer, who receives the vessel as a wedding present in 1981. In 2003, the ship is turned into a casino by Luke and investors Skye Chandler and Tracy Quartermaine. In 2011, Luke&#x27;s daughter Lulu Spencer purchases the boat, and in 2012 Johnny Zacchara invests to become co-owner. Together they turn the ship into a nightclub. The ship was destroyed in 2023.
* The Floating Rib is a bar located in downtown Port Charles, just a block away from General Hospital. Originally named Jake&#x27;s, the bar has been a hotspot for the local nightlife since the early 1990s. Coleman Ratcliffe becomes the owner in 2002, and Mac Scorpio takes over in 2012. There was also a popular fine dining restaurant in Port Charles with the same name in the late 1970s/early 1980s. In 2020, a bomb destroys the restaurant and kills multiple patrons.

==Accolades and recognition==
&quot;General Hospital&quot; cast and crew have won many awards since 1974 when the Daytime Emmy Awards were created. In 2012, the Creative Arts Emmy Awards were created. &quot;General Hospital&quot; has won 16 Daytime Emmys for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series.

In June 2009, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Luke and Laura&#x27;s Wedding&quot; at number forty-five on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. In December 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;General Hospital&quot; number eighty-eight on its list of &quot;100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot;. Citing the Luke and Laura pairing as reason for the soap&#x27;s &quot;stratospheric heights&quot;, the magazine also called the soap&#x27;s celebration of it sixtieth anniversary a &quot;feat&quot;.

==Broadcast==
During the 1960s, &quot;General Hospital&quot; earned decent ratings against the likes of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; on CBS, but there was a decline as the 1970s came, especially when NBC&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; became highly popular. For two years, it also faced CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel &quot;General Hospital&quot;, but decided to give it a second chance in 1978 when it expanded the show from an experimental 45 minutes to a full hour. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show&#x27;s ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most-watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial&#x27;s comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s Helena Cassadine.

From 1979 to 1988, &quot;General Hospital&quot; remained number one in the ratings, competing against two game shows and two low-rated soaps on NBC—&quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;—and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on CBS (although &quot;Guiding Light&quot; experienced a renaissance for a brief period in the middle of 1984, and became the #1-rated soap, briefly dethroning &quot;General Hospital&quot; from the top ratings spot). For the most part, however, &quot;General Hospital&quot; continued to triumph, even after the departure of popular actors Anthony Geary and Genie Francis in the mid-1980s. Although &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; took &quot;General Hospital&#x27;s&quot; place as the highest-rated serial in 1989, &quot;General Hospital&quot; continued to maintain excellent ratings.

Even at its peak in the 1980s, &quot;General Hospital&quot; had been pre-empted in at least two markets in the United States. With the show still number one in the Nielsens, WDTN in Dayton, Ohio preempted the series upon joining ABC in January 1980 in favor of &quot;Woody Woodpecker&quot; and &quot;Super Friends&quot; cartoons. Later, the station would air such shows as &quot;Hour Magazine&quot;, &quot;Geraldo&quot; and &quot;Maury&quot; in the show&#x27;s timeslot until September 2000, when the station&#x27;s new owners, Sunrise Broadcasting (which purchased the station from Hearst Television two years prior), pulled &quot;Maury&quot; from the station&#x27;s schedule, due to what it called &quot;community standards&quot;, and brought &quot;General Hospital&quot; back to Dayton. In Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York, WVNY dropped &quot;General Hospital&quot; from the schedule in the 1980s and would only bring it back in 1995. During that hiatus, &quot;General Hospital&quot; still aired on Montreal&#x27;s CFCF-DT, whose signal was decently available in Vermont and Plattsburgh.

Ever since the 1991–1992 season of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, the show has had a steady decline in ratings. On and off, it would rank between third and fifth place in the Nielsen ratings, with CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Young And The Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; coming in first and second place, respectively. &quot;General Hospital&quot; remained in between third and fifth place in the ratings during that time, and from late 1991 to 1996 &quot;All My Children&quot; held the title of ABC&#x27;s highest-rated soap.

After months of speculation and cancellation rumors, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported on April 11, 2012, that ABC quietly made the decision to keep &quot;General Hospital&quot; on the air and to cancel instead the lower-rated talk show &quot;The Revolution&quot;. On June 26, 2012, ABC officially announced that &quot;General Hospital&quot; would move to the 2 p.m. ET/PT timeslot starting on September 10, 2012, and that the network would give the 3:00 p.m. hour back to its affiliates, as it was the recommended time slot for Katie Couric&#x27;s new, ABC-syndicated talk show, &quot;Katie&quot;.

Encore episodes were shown every weeknight on the former cable channel Soapnet, with a marathon on Saturday and classic episodes at 4 a.m. EST and 5 a.m. (3 a.m. and 4 a.m. CST).

Production of &quot;General Hospital&quot; was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The show had banked roughly two months&#x27; worth of episodes at that time. By airing repeats on &quot;Flashback Fridays&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot; was able to air original episodes through the week ending of May 21. This was followed by several weeks of vintage episode repeats. Production resumed on July 22, 2020, and new episodes began airing on August 3.

On October 22, 2024, it was announced 10Play, a free video-on-demand and catch-up TV service by Network 10, would carry the soap in Australia beginning January 1, 2025. Foxtel&#x27;s W previously broadcast the soap in 2011.

===Schedule===

====Notes====
ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, and in Alaska and Hawaii follow a Central Time Zone schedule for daytime programming; thus, &quot;General Hospital&quot; is scheduled by the network to air at 1:00 p.m. in these areas.

# In September 2014, &quot;General Hospital&quot; reclaimed its former time slot of 3:00 p.m. Eastern/2:00 Central and Pacific on ABC owned-and-operated stations in New York City, Philadelphia, Raleigh–Durham, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco and Los Angeles; and affiliate KSAT-TV in San Antonio.

==Parodies and references in other media==
The popularity of &quot;General Hospital&quot; has gained it many parodies and references in other mainstream programs. For example:
*In the early 1990s, some episodes of &quot;General Hospital&quot; were featured as &quot;shorts&quot; during the fourth season of the parody show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. 
*The series was also parodied/homaged in the song &quot;General Hospi-Tale&quot; by The Afternoon Delights, and in the film &quot;Tootsie&quot;, which took place among the cast and crew of a fictional soap opera program. 
*In the Fox medical drama &quot;House&quot;, Gregory House enjoys &quot;Prescription Passion&quot;, which is an over-the-top parody of &quot;General Hospital&quot; that he watches constantly. In the season three episode, &quot;Half-Wit&quot;, House hides his blood test results under the name, &quot;Luke N. Laura&quot;, referring to &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s popular couple. 
*In the 1970s, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; had a recurring sketch called &quot;Veterinarian&#x27;s Hospital&quot; parodying the hospital soap opera/drama genre clearly inspired by &quot;General Hospital&quot; and shows like it. 
*&quot;Mad TV&quot; did a sketch on the series with actors Jacklyn Zeman, Rebecca Herbst, and Jacob Young. 
*The 1982 comedy film &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot; featured a large part of General Hospital&#x27;s cast from 1982. 
*The February 23, 2000 episode of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; covers a &quot;faux&quot; segment of the program with regards to David Letterman&#x27;s heart surgery.
*In a 2010 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, comedian Stephen Colbert poked fun at the show, responding to a clip of Maurice Benard&#x27;s Sonny Corinthos shooting Dominic Zamprogna&#x27;s Dante Falconeri, satirically screaming, &quot;Sonny shot Dante! No!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colbert Report 7/6/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ABC comedy &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, Erica and Adam frequently watch &quot;General Hospital&quot; together.
* In the book series &quot;Virgin River&quot; by Robyn Carr, Mel mentions watching &quot;General Hospital&quot; in nursing school.

==Spin-offs and specials==
The success of the long-running soap opera has had one sister serial, one spinoff in the United States, and two primetime spinoffs in the United States and the United Kingdom.

&quot;The Young Marrieds&quot; was ABC&#x27;s first attempt at a sister serial for &quot;General Hospital&quot;. It ran for only two years, racking up a total of 380 episodes. Despite its moderate popularity, it was aired against CBS&#x27;s top-rated &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which it could not compete against. The series finale aired on March 25, 1966, with the show&#x27;s main protagonist contemplating suicide. It ended in a cliffhanger, leaving the audience wondering if the man had killed himself or not. &quot;The Young Marrieds&quot; was set in the fictional suburb of Queen&#x27;s Point, which was considered by the writers to be a suburb of &quot;Port Charles&quot;.

The British television series &quot;General Hospital&quot; did not feature any characters from the American show, but was modeled after its format. It started as a half-hour program broadcast in the afternoons, which was unusual for British serials that normally aired in prime time. In 1975, it was expanded to an hour-long format and moved to Friday evenings.

&quot;Port Charles&quot; was a daytime drama that initially featured interns in a competitive medical school program, and was known for having more action actually in the hospital than &quot;General Hospital&quot; itself. It also included the characters of Scott Baldwin, Serena Baldwin, Lucy Coe, Kevin Collins, and Karen Wexler, all of whom originally appeared as characters on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. As the show evolved, it tended more towards gothic intrigue, including supernatural elements such as vampires and afterlife. It also switched formats from an open-ended daytime serial to 13-week story arcs known as &quot;books&quot;, similar to Spanish-language telenovelas.

&quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot; is the second American prime time spinoff of a daytime drama (the first being &quot;Our Private World&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;). Its first season aired from July 12, 2007, to October 4, 2007, on Soapnet, a cable channel owned by ABC. The series follows the nighttime adventures of familiar and new characters around the hospital. As of March 2008, the first season of the series was &quot;Soapnet&#x27;s most-watched series ever&quot;, with ABC Daytime and Soapnet President Brian Frons noting that &quot;Night Shift&quot; drew more than 1 million new viewers to the channel during its first season.

&quot;General Hospital: Twist of Fate&quot; was a primetime special that aired on Saturday, December 14, 1996. The episode picked up where that Friday&#x27;s show had left off. The special centered on Laura&#x27;s supposed death at the hands of Stefan Cassadine.

On April 2, 1998, &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired a primetime special in celebration of the program&#x27;s 35th anniversary. Hosted by Anthony Geary, the show focused and recapped on many popular storylines including Monica Quartermaine&#x27;s breast cancer, BJ&#x27;s death, and Stone Cates&#x27; battle with HIV. This was the first anniversary special that was broadcast in primetime and that did not include any of the current storyline.

On April 6, 2013, as part of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary commemoration, ABC&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot; aired &quot;General Hospital: The Real Soap Dish&quot;—a retrospective and behind-the-scenes special hosted by Katie Couric.

On September 5, 2014, it was announced that cast member Nancy Lee Grahn would begin to host a companion web series for ABC.com in January 2015, &quot;General Hospital Now!&quot;, which would feature behind-the-scenes interviews with fellow cast members, as well as panel discussions with comedians who are fans of the show.

On May 15 and 18, 2015, &quot;General Hospital&quot; aired two live episodes as part of its 52nd anniversary celebration, using the hashtag #GHLive to promote the broadcast on social media.

On December 15, 2023, it was announced ABC would air a primetime special &quot;General Hospital: 60 Years of Stars and Storytelling&quot;, in celebration of the soap&#x27;s sixtieth anniversary. The special featured interviews with present and former cast members, behind-the-scenes footage, blooper reels and a &quot;special fan tribute&quot;. The special aired on January 4, 2024.

<text>David Peck Todd (March 19, 1855 — June 1, 1939) was an American astronomer. He produced a complete set of photographs of the 1882 transit of Venus.

==Biography==
Todd was born in Lake Ridge, New York, the son of Sereno Edwards Todd and Rhoda (Peck) Todd. He prepared at John C. Overhiser&#x27;s School in Brooklyn. He studied at Columbia University from 1870 to 1872, then at Amherst College from 1873 to 1875, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in the class of 1875. He earned his M.A. from Amherst in 1878. He was awarded an honorary degree from Washington and Jefferson College in 1888.

Todd worked at the US Naval Observatory from 1875 to 1878, and at the US Nautical Almanac Office from 1878 to 1881. From 1881 to 1917 he was a professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at Amherst College. From 1882 to 1887, he was also a professor of astronomy and higher mathematics at nearby Smith College.

He married Mabel Loomis on March 5, 1879, and together they had one daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham. His wife had had an affair with William Austin Dickinson, the (married) brother of Emily Dickinson. The affair was an open secret in Amherst, and David Todd seems to have accepted it willingly. A collection of the two lovers&#x27; letters were published in &quot;Austin and Mabel: The Amherst Affair &amp; Love Letters of Austin Dickinson and Mabel Loomis Todd&quot; (). More information about the complex relationship among David Todd, Mabel Loomis Todd and Austin Dickinson can be found in After Emily: Two Remarkable Women and the Legacy of America’s Greatest Poet

By 1917, David&#x27;s deteriorating health and erratic mental behavior caused Amherst president Alexander Meiklejohn to force his early retirement from the College, and the couple moved to Coconut Grove, Florida. In 1922 Mabel and Millicent made the difficult decision to have David institutionalized; for the remainder of his life he was in and out of various mental and care facilities.

==Astronomical and other accomplishments==

Todd designed and erected several observatories, including those at Smith College from 1886 to 1888 and at Amherst College from 1903 to 1906. He established Standard Time in Peru in 1907. He was chief astronomer at the Lick Observatory during the transit of Venus in 1882, and created the first known photographs of the transit. At the time of the 2004 Transit of Venus, astronomers at the Lick Observatory found and animated Todd’s still photos.

He was a member of the American Astronomical Society, the Philosophical Society of Washington, and the Japan Society. He was fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society of Natural and Physical Sciences, Cherbourg, France; the Sociedad Geografica de Lima, Peru. In 1896 he was presented, by the Emperor of Japan, with the Imperial Saké Cup for services in the cause of education in Japan.

In addition, Todd was the organizer and leader of a number of important astronomical expeditions:

* The New England expedition to Texas for solar eclipse of July 29, 1878
* The American expedition to Japan for solar eclipse of August 19, 1887
* A U. S. scientific expedition to West Africa in 1889 and 1890
* The Amherst expedition to Japan for the solar eclipse of August 9, 1896
* The Lowell expedition to Tripoli for solar eclipse of May 28, 1900
* The Amherst eclipse expedition to the Dutch East Indies in 1901
* The Lowell Mars expedition to the Andes, 1907
* Expedition to Tripoli for the solar eclipse of August 30, 1905
* Expedition to Russia for solar eclipse of August 21, 1914
* Expedition to Florida for solar eclipse of June 8, 1918
* Expedition to Brazil and Argentina for solar eclipse of May 29, 1919

Todd crater on Phobos (a moon or satellite of Mars) is named after him. In addition, asteroids 511 Davida and 510 Mabella are named after him and his wife.

==Letter from James Clerk Maxwell to Todd==
On the 19th of March 1879, Maxwell wrote a letter to Todd. After Maxwell&#x27;s death in November 1879, Todd sent the letter to G. G. Stokes, who read the letter in January 1880 at a meeting of the Royal Society.
==Writings==

* &quot;Astronomy: The Science of the Heavenly Bodies.&quot; New York: Harper, 1922 

Todd was also the author of &quot;New Astronomy&quot;; &quot;Stars and Telescopes&quot;, and many shorter articles. He also edited the Columbian Knowledge Series.

<text>Tuggeranong () is a district in the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. The district is subdivided into divisions (suburbs), sections and blocks and is the southernmost district of the Australian Capital Territory. The district comprises nineteen suburbs and occupies to the east of the Murrumbidgee River.

The name &quot;Tuggeranong&quot; is derived from a Ngunnawal expression meaning &quot;cold place&quot;. From the earliest colonial times, the plain extending south into the centre of the present-day territory was referred to as Tuggeranong.

At the , the population of the district was .

==Establishment and governance==
Following the transfer of land from the Government of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government in 1911, the district was established in 1966 by the Commonwealth via the gazettal of the &quot;Districts Ordinance 1966&quot; (Cth) which, after the enactment of the &quot;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act&quot; 1988, became the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 1966. This Act was subsequently repealed by the ACT Government and the district is now administered subject to the &quot;Districts Act&quot; 2002.

===History===
Cave paintings and Aboriginal artifacts discovered in the area confirm that the Tuggeranong region has been occupied by the original inhabitants, the Ngunnawal people, for over years. The area lies close to the recognised traditional lands of the Ngarigo-speaking people. 

The first Europeans arrived in the Australian Capital Territory region in 1820 and a year later, a third expedition led by Charles Throsby reached the Murrumbidgee River near the present-day Pine Island and the valley now occupied by the Tuggeranong district. In 1823 Joseph Wild was employed by Brigade Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie to guide them to the Murrumbidgee. They travelled south along the river and named the area now known as Tuggeranong &quot;Isabella&#x27;s Plain&quot; in honour of Governor Brisbane&#x27;s infant daughter. Unable to cross the river near the current site of Tharwa, they continued on to the Monaro Plains.
The last expedition in the region was undertaken by Allan Cunningham in 1824. Cunningham&#x27;s reports verified that the region was suitable for grazing, and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.

In 1828, the bushranger John Tennant, known as the &#x27;Terror of Argyle&#x27;, was captured by James Ainslie and a party of others near the Murrumbidgee River in Tuggeranong. Tennant had been a convict assigned to Joshua John Moore at Canberry, a property in the present day inner north Canberra. Mount Tennent, behind Tharwa, is named after the bushranger (note the difference in spelling).

The first authorised settler was James Murdoch. In 1824 he was offered a land grant on a small plain known by the local Aboriginal people as &#x27;Togranong&#x27; meaning &#x27;cold plains&#x27;. He took up the grant in 1827. Lanyon station was established in 1835 and originally owned by James Wright, his brother William and John Lanyon. Wright bought the property from Lanyon, who had only remained in Australia for three years. In 1838, Wright commenced the building of the homestead, which he named after his partner, Lanyon. The homestead was built with the strength of a fort to withstand the attacks of bushrangers. Wright sold to the Cunningham family in 1847. In 1835 Thomas Macquoid, then Sheriff of the New South Wales Supreme Court, bought Tuggeranong station then known as Waniassa property (&quot;sic&quot;). The rural depression of 1840 hit hard and Macquoid committed suicide, fearing bankruptcy when he lost a civil suit brought by one William Henry Barnes. His son took over the estate and creditors allowed him to continue to operate it until it was sold by the Macquoid family in 1858 to the Cunningham family, owners of the neighbouring Lanyon property. They renamed Waniassa to Tuggranong. The whole area was part of the Tuggeranong parish in the late nineteenth century. Tuggranong homestead was rebuilt by the Cunningham family in 1908. In 1917 it was resumed by the Commonwealth Government for military purposes. The Cunningham family remained at Lanyon until 1926. Charles Bean, together with his staff, wrote the first two volumes of the twelve volume official history of Australia&#x27;s involvement in World War I at the homestead from 1919 to 1925. The Tuggeranong property was leased as a grazing property by the McCormack family from 1927 to 1976.

In 1973, the third of the new towns planned for the Australian Capital Territory was inaugurated at Tuggeranong on 21 February. It was originally planned to house between to people. Planning for the new town had begun in 1969. The first families moved into the suburb of Kambah in 1974. The fifth Canberra fire station opened at Kambah in 1979 to service the new developing satellite city.

==Location and urban structure==

The district is a set of contiguous residential suburbs consolidated around Lake Tuggeranong, in addition to vast pastoral leases that extend south of the suburbs of , and . The boundaries of the district are constrained by the Murrumbidgee River to the west, the border with the state of New South Wales to the south and east, and pastoral leases that mark the district&#x27;s boundary to the north, including the remnants of the Tuggeranong Homestead, and to the north-west.

Lake Tuggeranong was created in 1987 by the construction of a dam on a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River. On the edge of the lake are a number of community facilities, including Lake Tuggeranong College, a school catering to years 11 and 12 (16–18 years old); a library, which is part of the ACT Library and Information Services, a community centre, and the Tuggeranong Arts Centre.
The Tuggeranong Town Centre is to the west of the lake. It includes a major shopping centre, known as South.Point; managed, developed and part owned by Vicinity Centres. It is surrounded by offices of the Australian and ACT governments, and a light industrial area.

A further heavy industrial area is located in the suburb of that lies partly in the districts of both Tuggeranong and Jerrabomberra.

==Climate==
Tuggeranong has a temperate highland climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with dry, warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Frost is very common in the winter and snowfall occasionally occurs.
==Representation==
Tuggeranong is represented by:
* ACT Legislative Assembly: The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was granted self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1988 with the passage of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. The first Assembly was elected in 1989. There are currently 25 members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Members are elected every four years by the people of the ACT to represent them and make decisions on their behalf. The ACT Legislative Assembly has five multi-member electorates: Yerrabi; Ginninderra; Kurrajong; Murrumbidgee and; Brindabella, each electing five members.
* Tuggeranong Community Council: Tuggeranong Community Council is recognised by the ACT Government as a community body representing the interests of the local residents, businesses and organisations within the Tuggeranong region with the ACT Government. The Tuggeranong Community Council Is not a local government.

==Demographics==

At the , there were people in the Tuggeranong district, of these 49.2 per cent were male and 50.8 per cent were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.0 per cent of the population, which was lower than the national average, but higher than the territory average. The median age of people in the Tuggeranong district was 38 years, similar to the national median. Children aged 0–14 years made up 19.2 per cent of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 15.6 per cent of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 49.1 per cent were married and 12.3 per cent were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in the Tuggeranong district between the 2001 census and the 2006 census was 0.85 per cent; in the five years to the 2011 census, the population decreased by 0.25 per cent; in the five years to the 2016 census, the population decreased by 2.0 per cent and in the five years to the 2021 census, the population increased by 5.1 per cent. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.79, 8.32, 8.81 and 8.64 per cent respectively, population growth in Tuggeranong district was significantly lower than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the Tuggeranong district was significantly higher than the national average, and slightly lower than the territory average.

At the 2021 census, the proportion of residents in the Tuggeranong district who stated their ancestry as Australian or Anglo-Saxon exceeded 70 per cent of all residents (national average was 62.9 per cent). Meanwhile, at the census date, compared to the national average, households in the Tuggeranong district had a lower than average proportion (18.5 per cent) where a language other than English was spoken (national average was 24.8 per cent); and a higher proportion (81.0 per cent) where English only was spoken at home (national average was 72.0 per cent).

<doc id="716102" wikidata="Q6145455" url="?curid=716102" title="James Whiteside McCay">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir James Whiteside McCay, (21 December 1864 – 1 October 1930), who often spelt his surname M&#x27;Cay, was an Australian general and politician.

A graduate of the University of Melbourne, where he earned Master of Arts and Master of Laws degrees, McCay established a successful legal practice, McCay &amp; Thwaites. He was a member of the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was a champion of women&#x27;s suffrage and federation. He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901. He was Minister for Defence from 1904 to 1905, during which he implemented long-lasting reforms, including the creation of the Military Board.

As a soldier, McCay commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign of the Great War. He was later wounded in the Second Battle of Krithia and invalided to Australia, but returned to command the 5th Division, which he led in the Battle of Fromelles in 1916, dubbed &quot;the worst 24 hours in Australia&#x27;s entire history.&quot; His failures in difficult military operations made him a controversial figure who earned the disfavour of his superiors, while his efforts to succeed in the face of insurmountable obstacles earned him the odium of troops under his command, who blamed him for high casualties. In the latter part of the war he commanded the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom.

After the war, McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Bank of Victoria and also served on a panel that deliberated on the future structure of the Army. He was chairman of the Fair Profits Commission, the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission, and the Repatriation Commission&#x27;s Disposals Board. He commanded the Special Constabulary Force during the 1923 Victorian Police strike.

==Education and early life==
McCay was born on 21 December 1864 in Ballynure, County Antrim, Ireland, the oldest of ten children to the Reverend Andrew Ross Boyd McCay, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife Lily Ann Esther Waring (née Brown). The family emigrated to Australia in 1865, settling in Castlemaine, Victoria. Boyd McCay continued his theological studies while he was a minister in Castlemaine, earning a Master of Arts (MA) from the University of Melbourne in 1882 and a Doctor of Divinity from the Presbyterian Theological Faculty Ireland in 1887. Esther could speak seven languages. The two separated in 1891.

James attended Castlemaine State School. At the age of twelve he won a scholarship to Scotch College, Melbourne to the value of £35 per annum for six years. He was dux of the school in 1880. At Scotch College McCay first met John Monash, who would be dux the following year, and would later become a close friend. McCay entered Ormond College at the University of Melbourne in 1881, the year that the college first opened, and commenced studying for his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. McCay left the university without completing his degree in 1883 and took a job as a teacher at Toorak Grammar School. In 1885, he bought Castlemaine Grammar School. The school was co-educational; McCay believed that girls should have the same opportunities as boys. Among its students who attended university with McCay&#x27;s encouragement and support was Sussanah Jane Williams, who later became principal of Janet Clarke Hall at the University of Melbourne, and The Women&#x27;s College at the University of Sydney. The job of running the school was soon delegated to McCay&#x27;s mother and brother Adam.

He returned to the university in 1892 and completed his Bachelor of Arts degree. He then embarked on a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. In 1895, he was awarded an MA degree, majoring in mathematics. He completed his law degree the next year, with first class honours, in spite of rarely attending the lectures due to his work, political and military commitments. In 1895, he was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria and established a legal practice in Castlemaine. His practice had the first telephone in the town. He was awarded his Master of Laws (LLM) degree in 1897. In 1898, he went into partnership with William Thwaites, whose brother Walter married his sister. The firm&#x27;s name was then changed to McCay &amp; Thwaites. It would later hire one of the first women to become an articled clerk in Victoria. On 8 April 1896, McCay married Julia Mary O&#x27;Meara, the daughter of a Roman Catholic Kyneton police magistrate. Sectarianism in Australia made such marriages uncommon, and the marriage was opposed by both their families. It produced two daughters, Margaret Mary (&quot;Mardi&quot;) and Beatrix Waring (&quot;Bixie&quot;), born in 1897 and 1901, respectively.

==Political career==
===Victorian parliament===
In August 1890, McCay was elected to the local council of the Castlemaine Borough. When the prominent local Member of the Legislative Assembly, Sir James Patterson, died in 1894, McCay ran for his seat of Castlemaine in the resulting by-election. After a hard-fought campaign, McCay won by just ten votes. McCay devoted his maiden speech to what would be his defining cause as a state politician, women&#x27;s suffrage:

On other issues, McCay supported Federation, and was one of a number of young politicians who rallied around Alfred Deakin, threatening to bring down Sir George Turner&#x27;s government if it attempted to block federation. McCay opposed sending Victorian troops to fight in the Boer War, calling war in general an &quot;anachronism&quot;. In 1899, McCay was one of the young radicals who supported Allan McLean and crossed the floor to bring down the Turner government. McLean gave McCay the portfolio of Minister for Education and Customs in his new ministry. At the time it was the custom for members who had accepted a ministerial appointment to re-submit themselves for election. In the subsequent by-election, McCay&#x27;s opposition to the war in South Africa became an election issue. The war was now going badly for Britain. Feelings ran high and McCay lost his seat. McCay attempted to win his seat back at the general election in 1900 but lost again.

===Federal parliament===
With Federation in 1901 came the opportunity to run for the new Parliament of Australia. McCay contested the 1901 election as a Protectionist Party candidate for Corinella, the Federal electorate that encompassed the Castlemaine area. McCay, who characterised himself as a liberal, supported the widest possible enfranchisement of women, the protection of industry and revenue through tariffs, and the White Australia policy. The war in South Africa was now in its final stages and the electorate forgot or forgave McCay&#x27;s &quot;treason&quot;, electing him to the first Australian Parliament.
As a backbencher, McCay opposed amendments to the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved an amendment to the &quot;Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904&quot; to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson&#x27;s Labor government. The Free Trade Party&#x27;s George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence.

McCay became the sixth Minister for Defence in four years. His predecessor, Senator Anderson Dawson, had chaired a committee that had produced a detailed report recommending the abolition of the post of General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces and the creation of a Council of Defence, a Naval Board and a Military Board. It fell to McCay to implement the report&#x27;s recommendations and create a five-man Military Board consisting of himself, a finance member and three military officers. McCay preferred the senior member not be styled the Chief of the General Staff. This change would not be made until 1909. At the first meeting of the Council of Defence, McCay rejected the arguments of Captain William Rooke Creswell for the majority of the defence budget to be spent on supporting the British fleet. In 1905 the Reid government collapsed and McCay became a backbencher once more. Since the Federal parliament sat in Parliament House, Melbourne, McCay lived at the Stock Exchange Club in Collins Street, Melbourne while his family remained in Castlemaine. He maintained a liaison with a married woman, Ella Gavan Duffy.

In the 1906 redistribution, McCay&#x27;s electorate of Corinella was abolished and its territory divided between the electorates of Laanecoorie and Corio. McCay decided to run in Corio against the sitting member, Richard Crouch, although he was also a Protectionist, but Crouch won convincingly. In 1910, the Commonwealth Liberal Party Senate candidate, Thomas Skene, died suddenly two days before the nomination date for the 1910 election. McCay submitted himself as candidate but lost.

==Military career==
McCay&#x27;s military career began in 1884, when he enlisted in the 4th (Castlemaine) Battalion, Victorian Rifles. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on 29 October 1886, and was subsequently promoted to captain on 5 March 1889 and major on 13 March 1896. Following the forced resignation of the commander of the 8th Regiment for making a political speech touting McCay, McCay was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on 12 January 1900.

===Director of Military Intelligence===
On 6 December 1907, on the recommendation of the Chief of Intelligence, Colonel William Throsby Bridges, the Minister for Defence, Thomas Ewing appointed McCay as Director of Military Intelligence, with the rank of colonel. In turn, McCay turned to his former schoolmate, John Monash, whom he had appointed to the command of the Victorian section of the new Australian Army Intelligence Corps (AIC), with a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel on 28 March 1908. The AIC set about compiling information such as the suitability of lighthouses for signalling, the availability of railway rolling stock, and the number of civilian motor vehicles suitable for military use. A concerted effort was put into creating sets of detailed maps. McCay and Monash became close friends. In 1912, McCay &amp; Thwaites moved into offices at 360 Collins Street, where businesses associated with the Baillieu family were located. Monash moved his offices into the same building, and the two addressed each other as &quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;Jim&quot;. On 5 March 1912, McCay was appointed a commissioner of the State Bank of Victoria.

In 1911, McCay delivered a lecture at the Victorian United Services Institution entitled &quot;The True Principles of Australia&#x27;s Defence&quot;. He suggested that the Australian Army should be equipped to the same standard as the British Army and should be prepared to fight an enemy overseas rather than waiting for an invasion of Australia. On 11 April 1913, he resigned his position as Director of Military Intelligence and was placed on the unattached list.

===The Great War===
====Gallipoli====
On 2 August 1914, the government activated the preliminary stage of the war plan, which included the establishment of censorship. McCay was recalled to duty as Deputy Chief Censor (Australia), answerable to the Chief Censor in London. McCay organised a headquarters in Melbourne, and established district offices in the other state capitals. Soon after the outbreak of the Great War on 4 August, Bridges, now a brigadier general, appointed McCay to command the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Tunbridge on 10 August, who in turn was succeeded by Colonel Monash on 17 August.
McCay was assigned two regular officers as his brigade major and staff captain, but was permitted to choose his four battalion commanders. All of McCay&#x27;s choices were senior Militia commanders from Victoria. Three of them proved to be too old for the vigours of a modern campaign. The exception was his youngest appointment, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Elliott of the 7th Infantry Battalion, a University of Melbourne educated lawyer like himself. The brigade assembled at Broadmeadows Camp where it commenced its training. On 21 October McCay and his brigade headquarters embarked from Melbourne on the former P&amp;O ocean liner RMS &quot;Orvieto&quot;, which also carried Major General Bridges and the staff of his 1st Division. After sailing through the Suez Canal, it arrived at Alexandria, Egypt on 4 December 1914. The brigade camped at Mena, on the outskirts of Cairo, where training resumed. War correspondent Charles Bean noted that McCay &quot;trained his command with conspicuous ability. He did a great deal of detail work himself, drawing his own orders, and sometimes training his own platoons.&quot; On 4 April 1915, the 2nd Brigade packed its camp and moved by rail to Alexandria, from whence it embarked for Gallipoli for the landing at Anzac Cove.

McCay arrived off Anzac Cove on the transport SS &quot;Novian&quot; on the morning of Anzac Day, 25 April 1915, with his headquarters and the 5th Infantry Battalion on board. &quot;Novian&quot; had difficulties reaching her berth and when she finally reached it there were no boats to unload her. McCay therefore did not step ashore until about 06:00. There, he met Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, who asked him to deploy the 2nd Infantry Brigade on the right, on the 400 Plateau, instead of the left as planned. McCay did so, establishing his headquarters on what became known as McCay&#x27;s Hill. The 2nd Infantry Brigade was soon involved in &quot;the most costly struggle of the day&quot;. At 16:45 McCay telephoned Bridges at 1st Division headquarters to ask for reinforcements.

The Australian line was forced back on to the reverse slope, but did not break.

The commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, General Sir Ian Hamilton, now decided to make his main effort at Cape Helles. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, was ordered to send a brigade from each of his two divisions to Helles to reinforce the British and French troops there. McCay&#x27;s brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade were chosen. They embarked for Helles on 6 May. On the evening of 8 May, during the Second Battle of Krithia, McCay was given 35 minutes notice to conduct an advance across open ground in broad daylight. McCay protested that there was insufficient time to organise this but was overruled by Hamilton. The brigade suffered heavily. McCay led his men from the front, driving them on despite the futility of the attack. All of his staff were killed or wounded, and McCay&#x27;s leg was broken by a bullet. The advance was also pointless, for it could have been conducted after dark without loss. As a result, his men regarded him as responsible for their fate.

McCay was evacuated to hospital in Alexandria. He rejoined his brigade at Anzac on 8 June but the wound had not fully healed and he was lame, walking with the aid of a stick. In the meantime, General Bridges had been mortally wounded on 18 May and the Australian government sent the Chief of the General Staff, Major General James Gordon Legge, to replace him as commander of the 1st Division. McCay, Monash and Colonel Harry Chauvel were all disappointed at being passed over for the command, and protested to Birdwood and the Australian government, but to no avail. However, Legge chose McCay to command the 2nd Division, then forming in Egypt. Unfortunately, on 11 July, the day before he was due to leave for Egypt, McCay&#x27;s leg snapped where the bone had been broken at Krithia. He was evacuated again, this time to Malta, and then to the United Kingdom, where he was visited by Sir George Reid, now the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. McCay&#x27;s wife Julia died while he was in hospital. Several weeks later his father died as well. McCay was therefore sent back to Australia on compassionate leave. He arrived back in Melbourne on RMS &quot;Malwa&quot; on 11 November 1915, accompanied by his two teenage daughters and his brother Hugh, who had joined the ship in Adelaide, to a hero&#x27;s welcome. For his service at Gallipoli, McCay was mentioned in despatches for his &quot;great promptitude in supporting the threatened flank of the covering force&quot; during the landing and his &quot;conspicuous gallantry&quot; at Krithia. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and bestowed the &quot;Croix de Commander de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by the President of France. In addition he had, in Juĺy 1915, been promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier-general, dated back to 15 August 1914.

====Western Front====
The Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, appointed McCay to the newly created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that increased the number of hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o&#x27;clock closing.

Meanwhile, the Gallipoli campaign had ended and the AIF in Egypt was in the process of doubling in size from two divisions to four. Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, but Senator Pearce opposed this, ordering that one be given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under service conditions, carrying their packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial.

In June 1916, the 5th Division moved to the Western Front. Although the last to arrive in France, it would be the first to see serious action, a part of an ill-conceived plan by
Lieutenant General Sir Richard Haking, whose British XI Corps would attack a strong part of the line with inexperienced 5th Division and British 61st (2nd South Midland) Division. The resulting Battle of Fromelles was an unmitigated disaster. In one night, the 5th Division sustained 5,533 casualties, while the 61st Division lost 1,547. Haking was principally responsible but McCay bore some of the blame. He made tactical errors: his failure to pass on Haking&#x27;s cancellation orders led to the annihilation of the now-unsupported 58th&#x27;s men before crossing the field, described by C.E.W. Bean as one of the bravest and most hopeless assaults ever undertaken by the Australian Imperial Force; his order to vacate the first trench after it was cleared &quot;undoubtedly contributed to the causes of failure&quot;. His cancellation of a truce already in progress to recover wounded further damaged his popularity. For his part, McCay was mentioned in despatches a second time.

The 5th Division was out of action for some months. It finally moved with the rest of the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of fighting and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division&#x27;s 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay&#x27;s handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for treatment on his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia. Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time.

====United Kingdom====

On the recommendation of Brigadier General Robert Anderson, the Commandant,
Administrative Headquarters, AIF, and against the opposition of Birdwood, Senator Pearce appointed McCay as commander of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia, and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital. McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth, in the heart of the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located. He occupied this post for the remainder of the war, failing in bids to return to an active command at the head of the 5th Division, the Australian Corps, or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander. A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught. For his services in the United Kingdom, McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time, made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919.

On 10 March 1919, McCay handed over command of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom to Major General Charles Rosenthal. After a farewell dinner hosted by Monash, he embarked for Australia, where his AIF appointment was terminated. In 1919, along with George Swinburne and Generals White and Legge, he produced a report on the organisation of the post-war Army. In 1920, he joined Generals Chauvel, White, Monash, Legge, and Hobbs to produce a second report on the subject. McCay retired from the Army in 1926 with the honorary rank of lieutenant general.

==Later life==
McCay resumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 10 June 1919, a few days after he returned to Melbourne. He also resumed his relationship with Ella Gavan Duffy. On 30 December 1919, the Premier of Victoria, Harry Lawson, McCay&#x27;s successor in Legislative Assembly seat of Castlemaine and a former student at Castlemaine Grammar and Scotch College, appointed McCay as chairman of the Fair Profits Commission, a consumer protection body set up to monitor prices and profits. After his term ended in 1921, he was appointed to the advisory board of the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission. He was also Chairman of its Disposals Board from 1921 to 1922. In 1922, the State Savings Bank of Victoria took over the construction of war service homes in Victoria. During the 1923 Victorian Police strike, Monash appointed McCay to create, and later command the Special Constabulary Force that was established to carry out police duties during the strike. McCay ran this organisation from the Melbourne Town Hall, and later the Repatriation Department offices, which were made available rent free by the Commonwealth Government. The Special Constabulary Force was wound up in May 1924.

McCay&#x27;s daughter Mardi matriculated from Sacré Cœur School in 1914 and earned Master of Arts and Diploma of Education degrees from the University of Melbourne. In 1922, she entered the Society of the Sacred Heart. She taught at Convent of the Sacred Heart, Rose Bay in Sydney (now Kincoppal-Rose Bay) until 1956 when she returned to Sacré Cœur as Mistress of Studies. Bixie also attended Sacré Cœur and the University of Melbourne, at Janet Clarke Hall, where she became only the third woman in Victoria to earn a Master of Laws degree, and was enrolled as a barrister on 10 June 1925. Like Joan Rosanove, she could not obtain room in the Selborne Chambers, as women were not allowed to do so, so she put up her plate in the building next door. McCay followed his daughter and became a barrister, enrolling on 8 October 1925. In 1930, she married George Reid, a young barrister who later became Attorney-General of Victoria.

McCay became ill in 1930 with cancer. In his last months he destroyed all his papers. He died on 12 October 1930. He was survived by his daughters, now Reverend Mother McCay and Mrs George Reid, and six brothers and two sisters. He was given, at his request, a non-military funeral at Cairns Memorial Presbyterian Church in East Melbourne, and was buried at Box Hill Cemetery. For pallbearers he had generals John Monash, Harold Elliott, Cecil Henry Foott, R. E. Williams, and J. Stanley, along with Sir William McBeath, the chairman of the State Savings Bank; William Thwaites, his law partner; and businessman A. S. Baillieu. Among the other mourners was Generals Brudenell White and John Patrick McGlinn, who had been his deputy commander of AIF Depots in the United Kingdom; John Latham, the Leader of the Opposition; Dr W. S. Littlejohn, the headmaster of Scotch College and Sir John MacFarland, the Chancellor of the University of Melbourne.

==Legacy==
McCay is a controversial figure in Australian history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began before his death and continues to the present. General Sir Brudenell White considered McCay to be &quot;one of the greatest soldiers that ever served Australia, greater even than Monash.&quot; McCay&#x27;s achievements included the creation of the Military Board and the Australian Army Intelligence Corps, and the development of the Staff Corps, &quot;laying the foundations on which the Australian Army was built.&quot; In writing Volume III of the &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot;, which covered 1916, official historian Charles Bean exonerated McCay of blame for Fromelles. This led to a public debate in the pages of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in 1929 between critics of McCay and his defenders, led by Elliott. A revival of interest in Australian military history and the rediscovery of graves at Fromelles in the 21st Century led to a number of books being written about the battle, which tended to be critical of McCay.

<text>An internal or domestic passport is a type of identity document issued in a passport-like booklet format. Internal passports may have a variety of uses including:

# An ordinary identity document produced in a passport format (such as the modern Russian internal passport)
# Recording the residence and place of employment of citizens for civil registration purposes (such as the Chinese hukou)
# Management and restriction of internal migration (as in the Soviet Union)
# Recording demographic information such as ethnicity and citizenship and immigration status, sometimes related to structural discrimination (such as the pass books in Apartheid South Africa)
# Controlling access to closed cities and other sensitive locations

When passports first emerged, there was no clear distinction between internal and international ones. Later, some countries developed sophisticated systems of passports for various purposes and various groups of population.

== Summary ==

Countries that currently have internal passports in the strict sense (to control internal migration) include:
* (Hukou),
* (Hộ khẩu),
* (hoju)

The following countries issue internal passports as main identity documents for travel and identification purposes (analogous to identity cards in other countries):

* (Russian internal passport)
* (Turkmen internal passport, &quot;raýatlyk pasporty&quot;)

Internal passports are known to have been issued and used previously by:
* and its successor states,
* , until 1862
* (for certain indigenous groups from 1885 to 1941)
* (for African-Americans in slave states prior to the Civil War)
* (see Soviet Union internal passport),
* (&quot;passaporto per l&#x27;interno&quot;) 
* , between 1919 and 1940, not intended for traveling; but rather acting as personal identification documents entitling the user to Lithuanian citizenship.
* , during apartheid
* ( until 2008)
* (until 2016, replaced by National Card) 
* (from 1938 until 1943)
* (until 1860)
* (until 2020; new identity document officially called &quot;Passport of the citizen of Ukraine&quot; but carries no restrictions on internal migration)

==Terminology==
In many countries, the word &quot;passport&quot; is only used in modern language to denote a document issued for the purpose of international travel, which is subject to discretionary permission. However, in some post-Soviet countries, the word &quot;passport&quot; is implied to merely mean a primary identification document, especially if has the form of a booklet. Nevertheless, it is also extended by analogy to other forms of identification documents. For example, Ukrainian identity cards that are replacing old-fashioned internal passport booklets are still called паспорт (&quot;pasport&quot;, &quot;passport&quot;).

==Types==

===Canada===

In 1885 the &quot;pass system&quot; was introduced in Canada, to restrict and control the movement of First Nations people within Canada. Instituted at the time of the North-West Rebellion, it remained in force for 60 years despite having no basis in law. Any First Nation person caught outside his Indian reserve without a pass issued by an Indian agent was returned to the reserve or incarcerated.

===France===

In France, in the past, one had to show an internal passport to change city. Former convicts who had served forced labour, even after having served their sentence, had a yellow passport, which made them outcasts. A famous holder of the yellow passport is the former &#x27; Jean Valjean the hero of the novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo.

A &quot;décret&quot; issued 2 October 1795 (10 Vendémiaire year IV in the French Republican Calendar) required all persons traveling outside the limits of their canton to possess either an internal passport (for voyages within France) or external passport (for travel outside France). In 1815 an internal passport cost 2 francs and was delivered by the mayor of the commune to the residence of the passport requester. Internal passports were significantly easier to obtain than passports for foreign travel, which cost 10 francs in 1815. In the early 19th century, many emigrants obtained cheaper and easier-to-obtain internal passports to travel to the port of Le Havre, from which most ships to the United States departed. As control of the issuance of internal passports, which required a certificate of good behavior, was in the hands of the mayors of communes, there was some degree of favoritism in the issuance/denial of internal passports in the 18th century.

Internal passports were finally abolished in France in 1862.

====Booklet and notebook of circulation of travellers====

In France, the &quot;livret de circulation&quot; (booklet of circulation) and its variant the &quot;carnet de circulation&quot; (notebook of circulation) provided to those of no fixed abode were particularly constraining and discriminatory obligations imposed on itinerants.

At the end of 2012, when examining a , the Constitutional Council ended the notebook of circulation, considering that it harmed disproportionately the freedom of movement.

===South Africa===

In South Africa, the pass laws (notably the Pass Laws Act 1952, which applied until 1986) were a component of the apartheid system. The laws regulated where, when and for how long persons could remain outside their &quot;homeland&quot;—which, for many people, was not their homeland, so thousands of indigenous people were forced to change region. These laws also made it compulsory for all black South Africans over the age of 15 to carry a &quot;pass book&quot; at all times. However, the legislation also required that citizens of all races have on their person an ID book, which closely approximates a passport.

===Soviet Union and its successors===

The internal passport system of the Russian Empire was abandoned after the October Revolution in 1917, lifting most limitations upon internal movements of members of labouring classes in Soviet Russia. Labour booklets became the principal means of personal identification.

In 1932, the &quot;passport regime&quot; was reintroduced, its declared purpose to improve the registration of population and &quot;relieve&quot; major industrial cities and other sensitive localities of &quot;hiding kulaks and dangerous political elements&quot; and those &quot;not engaged in labor of social usefulness&quot;. The &quot;passportization&quot; process developed gradually involving factories, large, medium, and small cities, settlements, and rural areas, and finally became universal by the mid-1970s.

Internal passports were used in the Soviet Union for identification of persons for various purposes. In particular, passports were used to control and monitor the place of residence by means of the &quot;propiska&quot;, a regulation designed to control the population&#x27;s internal movement by binding a person to his or her permanent place of residence. For example, a valid &quot;propiska&quot; was necessary to receive higher education or medical treatment, although these services were not limited to the location registered. Besides marriage to a resident of another area, university education was the most popular way of circumventing one&#x27;s &quot;propiska&quot; and residing elsewhere. Also, since only a minority of dwellings were privately owned, having a &quot;propiska&quot; at a certain address meant that one had the right to live there.

All residents were required by law to record their address in the document and to report any relevant changes to a local office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For example, citizens needed to submit photographs of themselves for their passport, taken when they were issued the document at age 16, and again at ages 25 and 45. 

Formally, passports were not necessary for traveling per se in late Soviet Union. Bus, train, and air tickets were sold without names, and identification documents were not necessary for boarding buses and trains (and only became necessary to board a plane in the mid-1970s) except when traveling to/from border-adjacent areas and controlled cities. Nevertheless, passports were necessary for temporary propiska in a number of situations such as checking in a hotel or renting a private dwelling (no marks were placed in the document).

Moreover, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Soviet internal passports, accompanied with a special leaflet, were valid for traveling to most Comecon countries and Yugoslavia as a member of a touristic group. The leaflet functioned as an equivalent of exit visa stamped in international passports; destination countries did not require entry visas at that time.

====The Russian Federation====

In 1992, passports, or other photo identification documents, became necessary to board a train. Train tickets started to bear passenger names, allegedly as an effort to combat speculative reselling of the tickets.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union invoked the need to distinguish Russian citizens among the citizens of the former Soviet Union.

On 9 December 1992, special leaves were introduced which were affixed in Soviet passports, certifying that the bearer of the passport was a citizen of Russia. These leaves were optional unless travelling to the other former Soviet republics which continued to accept Soviet passports; for other occasions, other proofs of citizenship were accepted as well. Issuance of the leaves continued until the end of 2002.

On 8 July 1997, the current design of the Russian internal passport was introduced. Unlike the Soviet passports, which had three photo pages, the new passports have one. A passport is first issued at the age of 14 and then replaced upon at the ages of 20 and 45. The text in the passports is in Russian. Passports issued in autonomous entities may, on the bearer&#x27;s request, contain an additional leaf duplicating all data in one of the official local languages.

A passport exchange was begun; the deadline was initially set at end of 2001 but then prolonged several times and finally set at 30 June 2004. The government had first regulated that having failed to exchange one&#x27;s passport would constitute a punishable violation. However, the Supreme Court ruled to the effect that citizens cannot be obliged to exchange their passports. The Soviet passports ceased to be valid as means of personal identification since mid-2004, but it is still legal (though barely practicable) to have one.

The &quot;propiska&quot; was formally abandoned soon after adoption of the current Constitution in 1993, and replaced with Resident registration system which, in principle, was simply notification of one&#x27;s place of residence.

Nevertheless, under the new regulations, permanent registration records are stamped in citizens&#x27; internal passports just as were &quot;propiska&quot;s. That has led to the widespread misconception that registration was just a new name for the &quot;propiska&quot;; many continue to call it a &quot;propiska&quot;. The misconception is partly reinforced by the fact that the existing rules for registration make it an onerous process, dependent on the consent of landlords, which effectively prevents tenants of flats from registering.

Unlike with the &quot;propiska&quot;, it is not an offense not to have registration unless one resides in a particular dwelling for more than 90 days. From a practical point of view, the long deadline makes it difficult to prove avoidance of residency registration and so to prosecute. &quot;De facto&quot; citizens have no restriction on where they reside (with the exception of closed cities or near borders). Still, many civil rights are dependent on registration, such as the right to vote.

In November 2010, the Federal Migration Service announced the possible cancellation of internal passports, which, if it were implemented, would be replaced by plastic ID cards or drivers&#x27; licenses. In 2013, a plastic ID card, Universal electronic card was introduced, and any citizen had the right to reject it and retain an old-style internal passport. This card system was abandoned in January 2017.

====Belarus====

In Belarus, internal passports and passports for travelling abroad were merged into one kind of document in 1991. Passports are the primary means of identification for citizens of Belarus both in homeland and abroad. Belarusian citizens must have a passport after they have reached the age of 14; passports can also be issued to younger children for travelling abroad. Passports are valid for 10 years regardless of age.

Apart from visa pages, a considerable number of pages in Belarusian passports are designated for &quot;internal&quot; records, such as place of residence and marriage. Citizens had to obtain special stamp enabling the passport bearer to cross the border of the Union State before 2005 when the Constitutional Court ruled the practice not conforming to the Constitution.

Combination of primary identification document with international passport causes significant inconvenience to bearers who cannot certify their identity while their passports are processed for visas in embassies and consulates. A passport can also be easily invalidated by a careless foreign passport control official by placing a stamp in a reserved page.

===China and neighbors ===
The internal passport system in China and some neighbors evolved from an ancient &quot;huji&quot; system of family register. The system has evolved to manage internal movement, distribution of welfare, and other rights.

====People&#x27;s Republic of China====

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) maintains a system of residency registration in mainland China known as &quot;hukou&quot;, by which government permission is needed to formally change one&#x27;s place of residence. It is enforced with identity cards. This system effectively controlled internal migration before the 1980s, but subsequent market reforms caused it to collapse as a means of migration control. An estimated 150 to 200 million people are part of the &quot;blind flow&quot; and have unofficially migrated, generally from poor, rural areas to wealthy, urban ones. However, unofficial residents are often denied official services such as education and medical care and are sometimes subject to both social and political discrimination.

==== Korea ====
==== Vietnam ====
===Germany===
The Kennkarte was the basic identity document in use inside Germany (including occupied incorporated territories) during the Third Reich era. They were first introduced in July 1938. Due to legal arguments, the first cards were not issued until June 1941. They were normally obtained through a police precinct and bore the stamps of the corresponding issuing office and official. Every male German citizen aged 18 and older, and every Jewish citizen (both male and female) was issued one and was expected to produce it when confronted by officials. German authorities continued to issue them until 1943.

===Sweden===
Internal passports were abolished in Sweden in 1860.

===United States of America ===

Throughout the Thirteen Colonies before the Revolutionary War, slaves confined to homes or agricultural plantations, or whose movements were limited by curfews, could be required to furnish written evidence their owner had granted an exemption to permit their free movement. For example the New Hampshire Assembly in 1714 passed &quot;An Act To Prevent Disorders In The Night&quot;: Notices emphasizing the curfew were published in &quot;The New Hampshire Gazette&quot; in 1764 and 1771.

Internal passports were required for African Americans in the southern slave states before the American Civil War, for example, an authenticated internal passport dated 1815 was presented to Massachusetts citizen George Barker to allow him to freely travel as a free black man to visit relatives in slave states. After many of these states seceded, forming the Confederate States of America, the central Confederate government not only systematized this system but required internal passports for whites as well.

Such an internalized passport in the U.S. today would be unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

<text>The Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) is an analog video disc playback system developed by Radio Corporation of America (RCA), in which video and audio could be played back on a TV set using a special stylus and high-density groove system similar to phonograph records.

First conceived in 1964, the CED system was widely seen as a technological success which was able to increase the density of a long-playing record by two orders of magnitude. Despite this achievement, the CED system fell victim to poor planning, various conflicts with RCA management, and several technical difficulties that slowed development and stalled production of the system for 17 years—until 1981, by which time it had already been made obsolete by laser videodisc (DiscoVision, later called LaserVision and LaserDisc) as well as Betamax and VHS video cassette formats. Sales for the system were nowhere near projected estimates. In the spring of 1984, RCA announced it was discontinuing player production, but continued the production of videodiscs until 1986, losing an estimated $650 million in the process. RCA had initially intended to release the SKT425 CED player with their high end Dimensia system in late 1984, but cancelled CED player production prior to the Dimensia system&#x27;s release.

The format was commonly known as &quot;videodisc&quot;, leading to much confusion with the contemporaneous LaserDisc format. LaserDiscs are read optically with a laser beam, whereas CED discs are read physically with a stylus (similar to a conventional phonograph record). The two systems are mutually incompatible.

RCA used the brand name &quot;SelectaVision&quot; for the CED system, a name also used for some early RCA brand VCRs, and other experimental projects at RCA. The Video High Density system is similar to that of CED.

== History ==

=== Beginnings and release ===
RCA began developing the videodisc system in 1964, in an attempt to produce a phonograph-like method of reproducing video under the name &#x27;Discpix&#x27;. Research and development was slow in the early years, as the RCA CED team originally consisted of only four men, but by 1972, the CED team had produced a disc capable of holding ten minutes of color video (a portion of the &quot;Get Smart&quot; episode &quot;A Tale of Two Tails&quot;, re-titled &quot;Lum Fong&quot;).

The first CED prototype discs were multi-layered, consisting of a vinyl substrate, nickel conductive layer, glow-discharge insulating layer and silicone lubricant top layer. Failure to fully solve the stylus/disc wear and manufacturing complexity forced RCA to seek simpler construction of the disc. The final disc was crafted using PVC blended with carbon to make the disc conductive. To preserve stylus and groove life, a thin layer of silicone was applied to the disc as a lubricant.

CED videodiscs were originally conceived as being housed in jackets and handled by hand similar to LP records, but during testing it was shown that exposure to dust caused skipped grooves. If dust was allowed to settle on the discs, the dust would absorb moisture from the air and cement the dust particle to the disc surface, causing the stylus to jump back in a locked groove situation. Thus, an idea was developed in which the disc would be stored and handled in a plastic caddy from which the CED would be extracted by the player so that exposure to dust would be minimized.

After 17 years of research and development, the first CED player (model SFT100W) went on sale on March 22, 1981. A catalog of approximately 50 videodisc titles was released at the same time. The first title to be manufactured was &quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot;. Fifteen months later, RCA released the SGT200 and SGT250 players, both with stereo sound while the SGT-250 was also the first CED player model to include a wireless remote control. Models with random access were introduced in 1983.

=== Demise ===
Several problems doomed the RCA CED videodisc system long before it was even announced. The introduction of VCRs and home videotape in the mid 1970s—with their longer storage capacity and recording capabilities—posed a major threat to the system. However, development of CED continued. When the forthcoming system was formally announced in late 1979, RCA had projected annual sales of between five and six million players and 200 to 500 million videodiscs. The company had expected to sell 200,000 players by the end of 1981, but only about half that number had been sold, and there was little improvement in sales throughout 1982 and 1983.
The extremely long period of development—caused in part by political turmoil and a great deal of turnover in the high management of RCA—also contributed to the demise of the CED system. RCA had originally slated 1977 as the release date for the videodisc system; at that point, discs were not able to hold more than 30 minutes of video per side and the nickel-like compound used for manufacturing the discs was not sturdy enough. Signal degradation was also a problem, as handling the discs was causing them to deteriorate more rapidly than expected, baffling engineers.

60 minutes per side rendered it impossible for most movies over 120 minutes to be released on one CED disc. Many popular films such as some of the James Bond series, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; had to be released on two CED discs. All three of these examples were typically available on one VHS/Betamax cassette.

RCA had projected that by 1985, CED players would be in nearly 50% of American homes, but the sales of players continued to drop. RCA cut the prices of CED players and offered incentives to consumers such as rebates and free discs, but sales only slightly improved. RCA management realized that the system would never be profitable and on April 4, 1984, announced the discontinuation of production of CED players. Remaining stocks of players were sold by dealers and liquidation retailers for as little as $20 each. Unexpectedly, demand for the videodiscs themselves suddenly became high immediately after the announcement; RCA alerted dealers 
and customers that videodiscs would continue to be manufactured and new titles released for at least another three years after the discontinuation of players. Less than a year after this announcement, the sale of discs began to decline, prompting RCA to abandon videodisc production in 1986, after only two years.
The last titles released were &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; by CBS/Fox Video, and &quot;Memories of VideoDisc&quot;, a commemorative CED given to many RCA employees involved with the CED project, both in 1986.

== Technology ==

CEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are in diameter. To avoid metric names they are usually called &quot;12 inch discs&quot;. A CED has a spiral groove on both sides. The groove is 657 nm wide and has a length of up to . The discs rotate at a constant angular speed during playback (450 rpm for NTSC, 375 rpm for PAL) and each rotation contains eight interlaced fields, or four full frames of video. These appear as spokes on the disc surface, with the gap between each field clearly visible under certain light. This meant that freeze frame was impossible on players without an expensive electronic frame store facility.

A keel-shaped stylus with a titanium electrode layer rides in the groove with extremely light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a composite analog signal which is encoded into vertical undulations in the bottom of the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the stylus tip in the groove, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the frequency of a resonant circuit, producing an FM electrical signal, which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player&#x27;s electronics.

The capacitive stylus pickup system which gives the CED its name can be contrasted with the technology of the conventional phonograph. Whereas the phonograph stylus physically vibrates with the variations in the record groove, and those vibrations are converted by a mechanical transducer (the phono pickup) to an electrical signal, the CED stylus normally does not vibrate and moves only to track the CED groove (and the disc surface—out-of-plane), while the signal from the stylus is natively obtained as an electrical signal. This more sophisticated system, combined with a high revolution rate, is necessary to enable the encoding of video signals with bandwidth of a few megahertz, compared to a maximum of 20 kilohertz for an audio-only signal—a difference of two orders of magnitude. Also, while the undulations in the bottom of the groove may be likened to pits, it is important to note that the spacing of vertical wave crests and troughs in a CED groove is continuously variable, as the CED is an analog medium. Usually, the term &quot;pits&quot;, when used in the context of information media, refers to features with sharply defined edges and discrete lengths and depths, such as the pits on digital optical media such as CDs and DVDs.

In order to maintain an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils, which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to finely adjust tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking and a set of coils shifts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device, which is the analogue of CED stylus-deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm, in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tonearm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. For phonographs with pinpoint tip styli, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability; for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.

The disc is stored inside a caddy, from which the player extracts it when it is loaded. The disc itself is surrounded by a &quot;spine&quot;, a plastic ring (actually square on the outside edge) with a thick, straight rim-like edge, which extends outside of, and latches into, the caddy. When a person inserts a caddy containing a disc into the player, the player captures the spine, and both the disc and the spine are left in the player as the person pulls the caddy out. The inner edges of the opening of the caddy have felt strips designed to catch any dust or other debris that could be on the disc as it is extracted. Once the caddy has been withdrawn by the person, the player loads the disc onto the turntable, either manually with all SFT and most SGT prefix RCA players or automatically with the RCA SGT-250 and all other models and brands of players. When playback has been started, the player spins the disc up to speed while moving the pickup arm over the disc surface and lowering the stylus onto the beginning of the disc.

When Stop is pressed, the stylus is lifted from the disc and returned to its parking location, and the disc and spine are lifted up again to align with the caddy slot. When ready, the slot is unlocked, and the caddy can be inserted and withdrawn by a person, now with the disc back inside.

== Advantages ==
CED players, from an early point in their life, appealed to a lower-income market more than VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc. The video quality (approximately 3 MHz of luma bandwidth for CED) was comparable to or better than a VHS-SP or Betamax-II video, but sub-par compared to LaserDisc (about 5 MHz of luma bandwidth).

CED players were intended to be &quot;low-cost&quot; because they cost around half as much to manufacture as a VCR and had fewer precision parts.
The discs themselves could be inexpensively duplicated, stamped out on slightly-modified audio 
LP record presses.

Like VCRs, CED videodisc players had features like rapid forward/reverse and visual search forward/reverse. They also had a pause feature, though it blanked the screen rather than displaying a still image; many players featured a &quot;page mode&quot;, during which the current block of four successive frames would be repeatedly displayed.

Since CEDs were a disc-based system, they did not require rewinding. Early discs were available only in monophonic sound, but many later discs were issued in stereo sound. (Mono CED discs were packaged in white protective caddies, while the caddies for stereo discs were blue.) Other discs could be switched between two separate mono audio tracks, providing features such as bilingual audio capability.

Like the LaserDisc and DVD, some CEDs feature random access, allowing users to quickly move to certain parts of the movie. Each side of a CED disc could be split into up to 63 &quot;chapters&quot;, or bands. Two late RCA players (the SJT400 and SKT400) could access these bands in any given order. Unlike its laser-based counterparts, the chapters in a CED are based on minutes of the film, not scenes.

Novelty discs and CED-based games were produced whereby accessing the chapters in a specified order would string together a different story each time. However, only a few were produced before the halt of CED player manufacturing, and CEDs are much more prone to wear and tear compared to LaserDisc.

== Disadvantages ==

In comparison with LaserDisc technology, CEDs suffered from the fact that they were a phonograph-style contact medium: RCA estimated that the number of times a CED videodisc could be played back, under ideal conditions, was 500. By comparison, a clean, laser rot-free LaserDisc could, in theory, be played an unlimited number of times (although repeated or careless handling could still result in damage). 

Since the CED system used a stylus to read the discs, it was necessary to regularly change the stylus in the player to avoid damage to the videodiscs, while worn and damaged discs also caused problems for consumers. When a disc began to wear, video and audio quality would severely decline, and the disc would begin to skip. Several discs suffered from a condition called &quot;video virus&quot;, where a CED would skip a great deal due to dust particles stuck in the grooves of the disc. However, playing the disc several times would generally solve this problem.

Unlike VHS tapes, CEDs (along with LaserDisc) required a disc flip (however, some LaserDisc players were able to read both sides of the disc without physically flipping the disc, achieved by moving the laser from one side of the disc to the other, but this still resulted in a pause of playback during the change) at some point during the course of almost all films as only sixty minutes of video could be stored per side (75 mins on UK PAL discs due to the slower rotation speed); if a feature ran over two hours, it would be necessary to spread the feature over two discs. 

In some cases, if a movie&#x27;s theatrical running time was only slightly longer than two hours, studios would often trim short scenes throughout the movie and/or employ time compression (speeding the extra run time out of the film) in order to avoid the expense of issuing two discs.

This problem was not unique to CEDs: LaserDiscs presented the same difficulty, and some longer features, such as &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), still required more than one tape or disc in the VHS, Beta, and LaserDisc formats. There were no two-disc UK PAL releases.

Less significant disadvantages include lack of support for freeze-frame during pause, since CEDs scanned four frames in one rotation versus one frame per rotation on CAV LaserDisc, while computer technology was not advanced enough at the time to outfit the player with a framebuffer affordably. However, a &quot;page mode&quot; was available on many players that would allow those four frames to be repeated in an endless loop.

CEDs were also larger than VHS tapes, thicker than LaserDiscs, and considerably heavier due to the plastic caddies.

== Manufacture ==

=== Players ===
CED players were manufactured by four companies—RCA, Hitachi, Sanyo, and Toshiba—but seven other companies marketed players manufactured by these companies.

=== Media ===
Upon release of the CED system in March 1981, 50 titles were initially available; along with RCA (which included the company&#x27;s partnership with Columbia Pictures plus Paramount and Disney releases), CBS Video Enterprises (later CBS/FOX Video) produced the first 50 titles. Eventually, Disney, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, MCA, Vestron Video, and other labels began to produce CED discs under their own home video labels, and did so until the end of disc manufacturing in 1986.

== Market reception ==
Capacitance Electronic Disc&#x27;s competitors, Philips/Magnavox and Pioneer, instead manufactured optical discs, read with lasers. On April 4, 1984, after sales of only 550,000 players, RCA announced the discontinuation of CED videodisc players. RCA&#x27;s losses since the product&#x27;s introduction were eventually estimated at $650 million. The huge financial losses partially resulted in General Electric&#x27;s acquisition of RCA in 1986, and the abandonment of the &quot;SelectaVision&quot; brand on all RCA video products.

<text>Piraeus Bank () is a Greek multinational financial services company with its headquarters in Athens, Greece. Piraeus Bank&#x27;s shares have been listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX) since January 1918.

In Greece, with a 30% market share in loans (34.4 billion) and 29% in deposits (54.6 billion), it is the country&#x27;s largest bank.

Piraeus has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

==Overview==
Piraeus Bank is a universal bank providing various banking services.

Historically a bank supportive of SMEs it now also possesses particular know-how in the areas of agricultural banking, consumer and mortgage credit, green banking, capital markets, investment banking, leasing and electronic banking.

Piraeus Bank and its subsidiaries form the Piraeus Bank Group.

==History==
A group of shipowners in Piraeus founded &quot;Banque du Pirée&quot; (Piraeus Bank; BP) in 1916 to finance trade. The bank started trading on the Athens Exchange in 1918. The Greek government bought the bank in 1975 and transformed it into a universal bank. The new headquarters designed by Sir Basil Spence were built on Stadiou Street in the center of Athens. In December 1991 the government privatised the bank, which has grown in size and scope since then.

In 1962, PT joined the Emporiki Bank Group (or Andreadis Group). In On December 5, 1975, PT was nationalised and in 1991, the state privatized PT and the bank changed its name to Piraeus Bank (TP). Michalis Sallas takes over. In 1995 the Group established Piraeus Bank Romania with 160 branches and one year later Tirana Bank, the first privately owned banking institution in Albania with 56 branches. In 1999 with its acquisition of Xiosbank, PB took over Xios&#x27;s branch in Sofia, Bulgaria; it has now some 83 branches in the country. PB also acquired the small New York-based Marathon National Bank and Interbank N.Y; it merged Interbank into &quot;Marathon Bank&quot;.

In 1998 the bank absorbed the Greek branch networks of Chase Manhattan Bank, Crédit Lyonnais, and acquired a controlling interest in Macedonia-Thrace Bank. A year later it added in the activities of National Westminster Bank and acquired Xiosbank (Bank of Chios) which it totally absorbed along with Macedonia-Thrace Bank. In 2002 Piraeus Bank signed a strategic alliance with ING Group (bancassurance). In 2005 it acquired the Bulgarian Eurobank, Atlas Bank in Serbia, Egyptian Commercial Bank in Egypt. In 2007 it expanded in Ukraine by acquiring the International Commerce Bank (renamed as Piraeus Bank ICB) and established Piraeus Bank Cyprus with the acquisition of Arab Bank Cyprus.

In 2002 the bank absorbed 58% of ETBA Bank (Hellenic Industrial Development Bank). PB also started a strategic alliance with ING Group, which took a 5% stake in the Piraeus Bank. In 2006 the PB sold back to ING its stake in a jointly owned mutual funds company. Cooperation continues via the bank-assurance company ING-PIRAEUS.

In 2005 Piraeus Bank acquired the Belgrade-based Atlas banka in Serbia (today Piraeus Bank Beograd with 42 branches), and the Egyptian Commercial Bank (today Piraeus Bank Egypt with 43).

In 2007 PB purchased the Cyprus arm of Arab Bank and renamed it Piraeus Bank (Cyprus).
On 13 September 2007 Piraeus Bank completed its acquisition of 99.6% of the share capital of &quot;International Commercial Bank&quot; in Ukraine, today named Piraeus ICB.

Within the European debt crisis, Piraeus Bank has been subject to the Greek austerity packages: the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund became its main stock holder since 2012 and remained such as of 2020.

In 2011, according to reports in July 2012, the bank obscured its real access to capital by providing circular loans to finance purchase of its own stock through undeclared offshore companies.

In 2012, Piraeus Bank took part in the restructuring of the Greek banks, gaining a leading position in the Greek banking sector.
*In June 2012 Piraeus Bank sold its shares in Marathon Banking Corporation (New York City) to Investors Bancorp. The capital was used to finance the take over of the Greek banks Geniki Bank and healthy parts of ATEbank.
*In 2012 it acquired the so-called &#x27;good&#x27; part of Agricultural Bank.
*In December 2012 it acquired Societe Generale&#x27;s Geniki Bank.

In 2013, Piraeus Bank was considered as having sufficient capital and was included in the group of 4 systemic banks which would be coordinated by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to absorb undercapitalised banks. It would reach an international presence consisting of 370 branches focusing in Southeastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean as of 2014.
*In March 2013 it took over the Greek branches of Bank of Cyprus, Hellenic Bank and CPB Bank.
*In June 2013 it took over Millennium Bank (Greece).
*In April 2015 it also absorbed the &#x27;good&#x27; parts of small Greek Cooperative bank Panellinia.
*In May 2015 it sold its subsidiary in Egypt to Al Ahli Bank of Kuwait.

After a probe by the European Commission over government bailouts following the Greek government-debt crisis, in July 2014 restructuring plans for the bank were approved.
In November 2015 the European Commission approved amended restructuring plans for Alpha Bank and Eurobank and then for Piraeus Bank on 29 November 2015, allowing a new injection of €2.72 billion of public funds via the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund.

In the following years, Piraeus Bank proceeded to divest abroad.
*In March 2017, it sold Piraeus Bank Cyprus to an investment group led by Lebanese businessman Maurice Sehnaoui, which renamed it AstroBank.
*In September 2017, it sold its Serbian banking and leasing operations of Piraeus Bank Beograd, to Direktna Banka A.D.
*In December 2017, it sold Piraeus Bank Romania to J.C. Flowers &amp; Co.
*In April 2018, it sold Piraeus Bank Beograd to Direktna Banka A.D.
*In June 2019, it sold Piraeus Bank Bulgaria to Greek Eurobank and merged with its bank Postbank.

As of June 2019, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund held 26% of outstanding common shares, while the remaining 74% was held by the private sector (legal entities and individuals).

HFSF had the option to €2 billion of perpetual bonds into Piraeus Bank shares in December 2022. As of November 2020, the total market capitalization of the bank was less than €500 million. The conversion was triggered in November 2020, giving HFSF a further 35% share of the bank, worth less than 200 million euro, a paper loss of over 1.5 billion euro.

In March 2024, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund sold its entire 27 percent stake in Piraeus Bank, thus fully privatising the bank and raising 1.35 billion euros.

==Head Office==
The head office of Piraeus Bank in Athens was originally erected in the 1930s for the Pension Fund of the Greek Army (), which still owns it and leases it to the bank.

<text>O&#x27;Dea Castle, also known as Dysert O&#x27;Dea Castle, is an Irish fortified tower house, loosely described as a castle at Dysert O&#x27;Dea (), the former O&#x27;Dea clan stronghold, from Corofin, County Clare. It was built between 1470 and 1490 by Diarmaid O&#x27;Dea, Lord of Cineal Fearmaic, and stands some high on a limestone outcrop base measuring . The tower is adjacent to Dysert O&#x27;Dea Monastery, close to the R476 road.

==History==
The Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea, which drove the Anglo-Normans from the region for over 200 years, took place at this site on 10 May 1318. The castle was built between 1470 and 1490 by Diarmaid O&#x27;Dea, Lord of Cineal Fearmaic. The Earl of Ormond took the castle from the O&#x27;Dea clan in 1570 by force. By 1584, however, they had regained it. At that time, Domhnall Maol O&#x27;Dea was listed as owner. Domhnall supported the northern Chiefs in the Nine Years&#x27; War of 1594-1603 and subsequently Dysert Castle fell to the Protestant Bishop of Kildare, Daniel Neylon, who in 1594 bequeathed it to his son, John. The castle soon returned to the O&#x27;Dea clan. Conor Cron O&#x27;Dea supported the Confederates and participated in the successful siege of Ballyalla Castle in 1642.

After the fall of Limerick in 1651 to the Cromwellian forces, they maintained a small garrison here. When they left, the soldiers demolished the battlements, upper floors and staircase. The Neylon family then returned but during the reign of Charles II, Conor Cron O&#x27;Dea regained the castle. Conor&#x27;s sons, Michael and James, supported the cause of James II and once again lost the castle. The lands passed to the Synge family but the castle eventually and gradually fell into ruin.

In 1970, John O&#x27;Day of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (USA) purchased the tower and had it restored. The castle was then leased to the Dysert Development Association, which, with support from the Irish Tourist Board, opened it as &quot;The Dysert O&#x27;Dea Castle Archaeology Centre&quot; in 1986. It showed an exhibition of local artefacts from the Stone Age to 1922.

==Today==
Today, the castle is known as the &quot;Dysert O&#x27;Dea Castle and Archaeological Trails&quot;, and is open to the public from May to August. The archeology trails include sites around the tower, including the remains of the Dysert O&#x27;Dea Monastery.

<text>Chợ Lớn (, ), usually anglicized as &quot;Cholon&quot; in English sources, is a quarter of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It lies on the west bank of the Saigon River, having Bình Tây Market as its central market. Chợ Lớn consists of the western half of District 5 as well as several adjoining neighborhoods in District 6 and District 11. The quarter has long been inhabited by Chinese people and is considered the largest Chinatown in the world by area.

The Vietnamese name Chợ Lớn literally means &quot;big&quot; (lớn) &quot;market&quot; (chợ). The Chinese (and original) name is (In Cantonese, , which is occasionally rendered in Vietnamese orthography as &quot;Thầy Ngòn&quot; or &quot;Thì Ngòn&quot;, and in Mandarin, &quot;Dī&#x27;àn&quot;), which means &quot;embankment&quot; (French: &quot;quais&quot;). The Sino-Vietnamese reading of the Chinese name is &quot;Đê Ngạn&quot;, but this is rarely used. Vietnamese speakers exclusively use the name &quot;Chợ Lớn&quot;, while Chinese speakers (both inside Vietnam and in China) are the only users of the original Chinese name.

==History==
The city of Chợ Lớn was established by the Hoa community. The Lê dynasty which was the ruling family in the sixteenth century began to decline in power and two rival families, the Trịnh and Nguyễn families began to vie for power to fill in the void of the Lê. The Nguyễn lords were then appointed as Viceroy of the South with headquarters at Huế where they encouraged Chinese immigration to settle down into the area.

In 1778, Hoa people living in Biên Hòa (mostly in City Isle; &quot;Cù lao Phố&quot; of Hiệp Hòa ward nowadays) had to take refuge in what is now Chợ Lớn because they were retaliated against by the Tây Sơn forces for their support of the Nguyễn lords. In 1782, more than 10,000 Hoa people were again massacred by the Tây Sơn and had to rebuild. They built high embankments against the flows of the river and called their new settlement &quot;Tai-Ngon&quot; (&quot;Đê ngạn;&quot; meaning &quot;embankment&quot; in Cantonese).
Chợ Lớn was incorporated as a city in 1879, from Saigon. By the 1930s, it had expanded to the city limit of Saigon. On April 27, 1931, Chợ Lớn and the neighboring city of Saigon were merged to form a single city called Saigon–Cholon. The official name, however, never entered everyday vernacular and the city continued to be referred to as Saigon. &quot;Cholon&quot; was dropped from the city&#x27;s official name in 1956, after Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.

During the Vietnam War, soldiers and deserters from the United States Army maintained a thriving black market at Chợ Lớn, trading in various American and especially U.S. Army-issue items. This was the area, near the Quan Âm Pagoda where photojournalist Eddie Adams took his famous execution photograph. Four Australian journalists were also killed in Chợ Lớn during the Tet Offensive in 1968.

Today, Chợ Lớn attracts many tourists, especially mainland Chinese and Taiwanese.

==Notable residents==
*Yvon Petra - He was born in Chợ Lớn. He is best remembered as the last Frenchman to win the Wimbledon championships men&#x27;s singles title in 1946.
*Cao Văn Viên - Chief of the Joint General Staff of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1975.
*Gontran de Poncins - French author, aristocrat, and adventurer lived here in 1955. He resided in the Sun Wah hotel, keeping an illustrated journal that was published as &quot;From a Chinese City&quot; (published in 1957). &quot;He chose Cho Lon, the Chinese riverbank community snuggled up to Saigon because he suspected the ancient customs of a national culture endure longer in remote colonies than in the motherland. In effect, he was studying a bit of ancient China.&quot;

<text>The phascogales (members of the eponymous genus &quot;Phascogale&quot;), also known as wambengers or mousesacks, are carnivorous Australian marsupials of the family Dasyuridae. There are three species: the brush-tailed phascogale (&quot;Phascogale tapoatafa&quot;), the red-tailed phascogale (&quot;P. calura&quot;), and the northern brush-tailed phascogale (&quot;P. pirata&quot;). As with a number of dasyurid species, the males live for only one year, dying after a period of frenzied mating. The name &quot;wambenger&quot; comes from the Nyungar language. The term &quot;Phascogale&quot; was coined in 1824 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in reference to the brush-tailed phascogale, and means &quot;pouched weasel&quot;. All three species are listed as either Near Threatened or Vulnerable by the IUCN.

==Phylogeny==
The following is a phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome sequences:
==Species==
The genus consists of the following three species:
==Life cycle==
Mating generally happens between May and July. All males die soon after mating. Females give birth to about 6 young ones about 30 days after mating. Phascogales do not have the true pouch that is found in most other marsupials . Instead, they form temporary folds of skin - sometimes called a &quot;pseudo-pouch&quot; around the mammary glands during pregnancy. Young stay in this pseudo-pouch area, nursing for about 7 weeks before being moved to a nest where they stay until they are weaned at about 20 weeks of age. Females live for about 3 years, and generally produce one litter.
