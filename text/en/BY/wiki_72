<text>Brian Boucher ( ; born January 2, 1977) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who is a game analyst on national TNT games and also Philadelphia Flyers games on NBC Sports Philadelphia. He played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers, Phoenix Coyotes, Calgary Flames, Chicago Blackhawks, Columbus Blue Jackets, San Jose Sharks, and Carolina Hurricanes.

He led the league in goals against average for the 1999–2000 NHL season. He currently holds the NHL&#x27;s modern record for the longest shutout streak at 332:01, set while he was a member of the Phoenix Coyotes during the 2003–04 NHL season.

==Playing career==

===Early Philadelphia years===
Boucher was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, 22nd overall. He began play with the Flyers during the 1999–2000 season, taking the starting position from veteran John Vanbiesbrouck and helping the team secure the Eastern Conference and Atlantic Division regular season titles while leading the NHL in goals against average (GAA) at 1.91. In the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, he backstopped his team to the Eastern Conference Finals. En route, he recorded several memorable moments, including a five-overtime victory against the Pittsburgh Penguins and a sprawling save against Patrik Eliáš of the New Jersey Devils, which thereafter became known as a &quot;Boosh&quot; among goaltenders. Although the Flyers were ahead three games to one in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Devils, and despite the return of the injured Eric Lindros, Boucher and the Flyers lost in seven games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Devils. In the 2000–01 season, a weak start to the season saw him lose his starting position to Roman Čechmánek.

===Phoenix/Shutout streak===

On June 12, 2002, Boucher was traded (along with multiple draft picks) to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Michal Handzuš and Robert Esche. In the 2003–04 season, Boucher broke the modern-day NHL record for the longest shutout streak by a goaltender, going unscored upon for 332 minutes, or five-and-a-half games. On February 1, 2006, he was traded to the Calgary Flames (along with Mike Leclerc) in exchange for Steven Reinprecht and Philippe Sauvé.

===Chicago/Columbus===
Boucher began the 2006–07 season with the Chicago Blackhawks. On February 27, 2007, he was acquired on waivers by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Boucher arrived hours prior to the Blue Jackets-Colorado Avalanche game that evening. During the game, he wore Ty Conklin&#x27;s number 35 sweater. On March 3, 2007, Boucher made his Blue Jackets debut against his former team, Phoenix. His first game was a 4–3 win.

===San Jose Sharks===
On July 23, 2007, Boucher signed an American Hockey League (AHL) contract with the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; AHL affiliate. He played with the Phantoms until he signed a one-year contract with the San Jose Sharks on February 26, 2008.
On June 25, 2008, stating how much he liked the San Jose atmosphere, he signed another one-year contract with the Sharks, worth US$650,000. He recorded consecutive shutouts in each of his first two games of the 2008–09 season for the Sharks before allowing a goal in his third game.

===Return to Philadelphia===
On July 1, 2009, Boucher agreed to a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers to be the steady, veteran backup to the starting goaltender Ray Emery. However, when Emery incurred an injury midway through the season, Boucher was thrust into the spotlight with mediocre results. A hand injury soon pushed Boucher to the sideline, and he was replaced by third-string goaltender Michael Leighton. Leighton excelled in Boucher&#x27;s absence, and once healthy, Boucher found himself backing-up Leighton. Upon the return of Emery, Boucher was further demoted to the press box, with Leighton now the backup. Emery soon re-injured himself, giving Boucher a chance to back-up Leighton, who once again was playing well. Near the end of the season, with only 13 games left, Leighton went down with a high-ankle sprain, and Boucher was back into the spotlight for the Flyers once again. After a 2–1 shootout victory in the final game of the season against the New York Rangers, Boucher and the Flyers advanced to the playoffs.

In the 2010 playoffs, Boucher defeated Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils in the first round four games to one. The national media remarked he was the surprise of the playoffs after the first round with his outstanding play in net. The Flyers defeated the Boston Bruins in the second round by overcoming a three-game deficit, but Boucher was injured in Game 5 of that series with knee injuries. Boucher returned from his injuries to serve as a backup to Leighton in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. He saw game action in Game 1 and Game 5 in relief of Leighton, but the Flyers lost in six games to the Blackhawks.
In the 2010–11 season, Boucher split time in goal with standout rookie Sergei Bobrovsky after Leighton was demoted to the AHL, in part for hiding an injury. Bobrovsky started most of the games, and was named the Flyers playoff starter. After Game 2 of the conference quarter-finals against the Buffalo Sabres, in which Boucher relieved Bobrovsky and earned the win, Boucher started the next three games. However, he was pulled in Game 5 in favour of Leighton, who was called up as a third goaltender. Leighton played well but lost Game 5 in overtime, nonetheless earning the start for Game 6. However, in Game 6, Leighton allowed three goals in the opening period, and once again Boucher was able to earn the win in relief, making Boucher the only goaltender in NHL history to record two wins in a playoff series when coming in relief. Boucher went on to start Game 7 as the Flyers defeated Buffalo. Boucher started the first three games in the next round against Boston, but played poorly, allowing for deposed starter Bobrovsky to return in Game 4 as the Flyers were ultimately swept.

===Carolina Hurricanes and third stint with Flyers===
After the Flyers acquired goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov and decided to keep Bobrovsky as backup, Boucher was the odd man out. On July 1, 2011, Boucher was signed by the Carolina Hurricanes to a two-year contract worth $950,000 per season. He played sparingly as the backup to Cam Ward, and his season ended early due to injury.

On January 13, 2013, after the end of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Boucher began his third stint with the Flyers, and fourth overall with the organization, when he and defenseman Mark Alt were traded to Philadelphia in exchange for Luke Pither. Three days later, Boucher was waived and sent down to Adirondack, the new home of the AHL Phantoms. Boucher was named the team&#x27;s starting goaltender, relegating previous starter Scott Munroe to backup duty and sending Phantoms backup Cal Heeter to the Trenton Titans, the Flyers&#x27; ECHL affiliate. On February 10, Boucher was recalled by the Flyers after Michael Leighton suffered a lower body injury. He saw action in four games before being sent back down to Adirondack on March 9 after Leighton returned to health.

==Broadcasting career==
After he retired from hockey in 2013, Boucher served as a studio analyst for the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; regional telecasts on NBC Sports Philadelphia with host Al Morganti. He also worked on select regional television broadcasts on the network on a rotating basis along with Bill Clement and Scott Hartnell when lead color commentator Keith Jones was unavailable. On September 11, 2023, he was promoted as lead color commentator for the network, replacing Keith Jones.

Starting in the 2015–16, Boucher joined NBC Sports as an &quot;Inside the Glass&quot; reporter and studio analyst. From 2018 to 2021, Boucher worked with the lead broadcast team of Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk, a role he shares with Pierre McGuire.

In addition to NBCSN, Boucher was also a studio analyst for NHL Network.

After the conclusion of NBC&#x27;s last Stanley Cup Finals, Boucher joined ESPN/ABC for its NHL coverage, starting with the 2021–22 season, ESPN/ABC&#x27;s first season under a 7-year reunion deal, which brought both networks its first set of NHL games since 2004, as their co-lead color commentator, alongside Ray Ferraro. On nights when at least two games were aired on either network, he mostly teamed up with Bob Wischusen and reporter Leah Hextall on the #2 broadcast team.

Before the 2023–24 season, Boucher left ESPN/ABC to join TNT, reuniting with former NBC Sports lead pair of Kenny Albert and Eddie Olczyk as the new lead ice-level analyst, replacing Keith Jones, who left to become the new President of Hockey Operations for the Philadelphia Flyers.

==Personal life==
Boucher has a wife, Melissa, and a son and daughter. He had an older brother, Bruce Boucher, who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2014. His son Tyler is a left winger for the Ottawa 67&#x27;s and was a first-round draft choice of the Ottawa Senators in 2021. Boucher attended Mount St. Charles Academy in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and played major junior hockey for the Tri-City Americans.

<text>The AirPort Express is a discontinued Wi-Fi base station product from Apple Inc., part of the AirPort product line. While more compact and in some ways simpler than another Apple Wi-Fi base station, the AirPort Extreme, the Express offers audio output capability the Extreme lacks. The AirPort Express was the first AirPlay device to receive streamed audio from a computer running iTunes on the local network. AirPort Express outperforms the stringent requirements of the ENERGY STAR Program Requirements for Small Network Equipment (SNE) Version 1.0.

Apple discontinued developing its wireless routers in 2018, but continues limited support of later models.

In Japan, the AirPort Express is called the AirMac express.

==Description==
When connected to an Ethernet network, the Express can function as a wireless access point. The latest model allows up to 50 networked users. It can be used as an Ethernet-to-wireless bridge under certain wireless configurations. It can be used to extend the range of a network, including functioning as a printer and audio server. The model introduced in June 2012 includes two Ethernet ports: one WAN and one LAN.

The AirPort Express uses an audio connector that combines a 3.5 mm minijack socket and a mini-TOSLINK optical digital transmitter, allowing connection to an external digital-to-analog converter (DAC) or amplifier with internal DAC. Standard audio CDs ripped in iTunes into Apple Lossless format streamed to the AirPort Express will output a bit-for-bit identical bitstream when compared to the original CD (provided any sound enhancement settings in iTunes are disabled). DTS-encoded CDs ripped to Apple Lossless audio files - which decode as digital white noise in iTunes - will play back correctly when the AirPort Express is connected via TOSLINK to a DTS-compatible amplifier–decoder. This is limited to 16-bit and 44.1 kHz when streaming from iTunes; any higher quality content, such as high fidelity audio that uses up to 24-bit and/or 192 kHz will be truncated down to 16-bit and 44.1 kHz.

The audio output feature of the AirPort Express on a system running OS X Lion or earlier can only be used to wirelessly stream audio files from within iTunes to an attached stereo system. It cannot be used to output the soundtrack of iTunes video content to an attached stereo. OS X Mountain Lion introduced AirPlay support, a feature to output Mac system-wide audio directly to AirPort Express. This allows output of the audio of protected video content within iTunes, and also correctly maintains the audio sync with the image displayed on-screen. Video is synced with output audio when playing the video through an AirPort Express if the video is in a format supported by QuickTime Player (such as HTML 5 video in Safari etc.).

For Windows and Mac operating systems (before OS X Mountain Lion) there are a few software options available for streaming system-wide audio to the AirPort Express, such as Airfoil and TuneBlade. For the Logitech Media Server (Squeezeserver), the Airplay bridge plugin allows it to behave as a seamless squeezeplayer client 

== History == 

=== 2004 model ===
The first version (M9470LL/A, model A1084) was introduced by Apple on July 7, 2004; it included an analog–optical audio mini-jack output, a USB port for remote printing, and one Ethernet port. The USB port could also be used to charge the first generation iPod Shuffle, although this was not supported by Apple. The main processor of the 802.11g AirPort Express was a Broadcom BCM4712KFB wireless networking chipset, which incorporated a 200 MHz MIPS processor. The audio was handled by a Texas Instruments Burr-Brown PCM2705 16-bit digital-to-analog converter.

=== 2008 model ===
An updated version (MB321LL/A, model A1264) supporting the faster 802.11 Draft-N draft specification and operation in either of the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, with almost all other features identical, was introduced by Apple in March 2008. The revised unit includes an 802.11a/n (5 GHz) mode, which allows adding Draft-N to an existing 802.11b/g network without disrupting existing connections, while preserving the increased throughput that Draft-N can provide. Up to 10 wireless units can connect to this AirPort Express.

=== 2012 model ===

In 2012 Apple introduced a completely redesigned model with a new square form factor and two ethernet ports.

On August 28, 2018 Apple added AirPlay 2 support to the 2012 AirPort Express, providing the ability to be added to the Apple Home app as an audio destination.

===Discontinuation and support===
On November 21, 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple had disbanded its wireless router division, &quot;according to people familiar with the matter.&quot;

In an April 2018 statement to 9to5Mac, Apple announced the discontinuation of its AirPort line, effectively leaving the consumer router market. Apple continued supporting the AirPort Express, although an older version of its &quot;AirPort Utility&quot; is required to support the earliest version of the device.

<doc id="714238" wikidata="Q898410" url="?curid=714238" title="Philippe Boucher">
<text>Philippe Boucher (born March 24, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League. He was the general manager of the Drummondville Voltigeurs of the QMJHL from 2019 to 2023. He also served as GM with the Quebec Remparts and the Rimouski Oceanic.

==Playing career==
===Amateur===
As a youth, Boucher played in the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with minor ice hockey team from Lotbinière, Quebec and Rive-Sud.

Boucher began his junior ice hockey career with the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League&#x27;s Granby Bisons in 1990. Boucher enjoyed immense success in his first season, producing at a nearly point-per-game average and winning the QMJHL Rookie of the Year award. He was also named a second-team QMJHL All-Star. His second season came with just as much success, as Boucher notched 77 points in 65 games with Granby and the Laval Titan, once again being named a second-team All-Star. Boucher spent one more seasons in the QMJHL, splitting time between Granby, Laval, and later two professional teams.

===Professional===
The Buffalo Sabres drafted Boucher in the first round, 13th overall, in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. A year later, Boucher would begin his professional career, starting the 1992–1993 season as a defenceman for the Sabres. Despite some solid outings, and even a game where Boucher posted a +5 plus/minus rating, Boucher ended the season with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League. After three somewhat disappointing seasons with the Sabres, Boucher was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings during the 1994–1995 season.
In Los Angeles, Boucher produced better numbers, but still proved unreliable to finish a complete 80+ game season in the NHL. Criticisms aimed at Boucher also claimed he was not as defensively reliable or physical as other professional defencemen his size. Even so, Boucher was a consistent blueliner for the Kings for eight seasons, and played a career-high 80 games in the 2001–2002 season.

In 2002, Boucher signed as a free agent with the Dallas Stars, reuniting with the former special teams coach of the Kings, Dave Tippett.

On November 28, 2003, late in the third period of a game against the New Jersey Devils, an errant puck hit Boucher on the left side of his face, breaking his left orbital bone. Boucher had surgery on December 1 to repair the bone, putting him on the injured list for weeks. Since the injury, Boucher has worn a visor.

In the 2006–07 NHL season, Boucher had a break-out year, tying the Stars&#x27; franchise record for most goals by a defenceman in a regular season, with 19 goals. Boucher was selected by the NHL to play in the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game in Dallas on January 24, 2007. Since Scott Niedermayer, one of two defencemen on the starting line-up chosen by the fans, was injured at the time, Western All-Star coach Barry Trotz named Boucher on the starting line-up as Niedermayer&#x27;s replacement.

During the 2008–09 season on November 16, 2008, Boucher was traded by the Stars to the Pittsburgh Penguins in return for Darryl Sydor. He helped the Penguins capture the Stanley Cup, his first, before announcing his retirement from the NHL on September 3, 2009.

==Personal life==
Boucher resides with his wife Lucie and their two children, Matthew and Vanessa in Quebec City during the summer. Boucher founded the Philippe-Boucher Foundation, which helps underprivileged children in the Lotbinière region.

<doc id="714241" wikidata="Q1958687" url="?curid=714241" title="Jack Butler (Jiwarli)">
<text>Jack Butler (4 May 1901 – April 1986) was an Indigenous Australian and perhaps the last speaker of the Jiwarli dialect.

== Early life ==
Jack Butler was born on 4 May 1901 at Wilukampal (also known as Caraline Creek and Caraline Well), an outcamp near Moroonah Station in northwestern Western Australia. His mother, called Silver in English, was a Tharrkari woman who worked as a cook at the outcamp. His father was Dick Butler, a white shepherd who moved to Darwin. His stepfather, Jinapuka, also known as Yawartawari, was a Warriyangka man.

In 1905 or 1906 Butler and his family moved to Glennflorrie Station, where he helped to look after male elders. In 1923 the family moved to Gifford Creek Station on the West Lyons River. In 1926 Butler moved to Mount Stuart Station and in 1927 he married Molly Ashburton, a Thalanyji woman. They had four children – Paul, Maggie, Sid and Claude – between 1928 and 1938.

== Jiwarli language ==
With his younger brother Joe Butler, Jack Butler was one of the last speakers of the Jiwarli dialect and contributed to its study and documentation. Between 1978 and 1986 he collaborated with linguist Peter Austin to document Jiwarli history, language and culture, and to create a Jiwarli dictionary and story collection. Butler and Austin recorded more than 70 texts and a lexicon of around 1500 words, as well as related linguistic recordings. Butler&#x27;s recordings provide one of the only audio documentations of Jiwarli.

In 1985 he recounted two stories from his childhood to Austin in Jiwarli. One story describes an earthquake in about 1906. The other describes the appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1910. The stories are culturally, linguistically and historically significant, as they provide evidence that traditional Jiwarli cultural and family life were relatively intact when Butler was a child. According to Austin, although white colonisation of the area began in the 1860s, it was not until the expansion of the Western Australian pearling industry and its forced labour system in the 1920s that traditional Jiwarli life was &quot;irreparably disrupted&quot;.

<doc id="714243" wikidata="Q7641018" url="?curid=714243" title="Sunrise/Back to the Future">
<text>Sunrise/Back to the Future were English acid house promoter who became one of the most successful organisators for large scale rave parties in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

One commentator states &quot;Over the course of 1989, promoters such as Biology [Jarvis Sandy, Tarquin de Meza &amp; Michael Jump], Energy [Jeremy Taylor &amp; Tin Tin Chambers], Weekend World [Tarquin de Meza], World Dance [Anton, Chris &amp; Jay] &amp; Genesis, succeeded in setting acid house nights free of the urban core&#x27;s constructions, staging ever more elaborate Orbital parties in borrowed and rented fields, the odd warehouse, or some other similarly vacant structure&quot;.

==Tony Colston-Hayter and Sunrise==
In the late 1980s, Tony Colston-Hayter teamed up with Roger Goodman, to organise a number of club nights masquerading as private parties with names such as Apocalypse Now. These parties would be promoted by Colston-Hayter by phoning up ITN and asking them to do an &quot;...And Finally&quot; report about this new youth culture scene (acid house) on the ITV News. However by the time Colston-Hayter had invited another ITV news team down to promote his latest party late in 1988 (this time from Granada&#x27;s current affairs show &quot;World in Action&quot;) acid house was being described as a &quot;sinister and evil cult&quot; that was just encouraging people to take drugs. At that point the scene moved from acid house parties in the centre of London, to raves around the M25 orbital motorway, with Colston-Hayter teaming up with Paul Staines to create Sunrise.

Run by Colston-Hayter and Staines, the organisation was occasionally front-page news. In 1989, Colston-Hayter evaded imprisonment for organising an unlicensed party (&quot;Sunrise: A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at White Waltham Airfield aka &quot;Ecstasy Airport&quot;) by claiming that he issued membership cards for Sunrise and it was a private party. Shortly afterwards, on 8 July, he appeared in an &quot;After Dark&quot; television programme about gambling, alongside Victor Lownes and Al Alvarez among others, and on 19 November 1989 appeared on the &quot;One Hour with Jonathan Ross&quot; chat show. On this show he appeared alongside Siouxsie Sioux and ZTT co-founder/creative Paul Morley, a journalist who had suspicions that Colston-Hayter did not care for the culture, and was just out to monetise the scene. As during the interview Colston-Hayter threw a glass of water over Morley before handcuffing himself to the host, the footage has turned up in many 21st Century clip shows, such as the Channel 5 programme &quot;When TV Guests Go Horribly Wrong&quot;.

In 2014, Colston-Hayter was imprisoned for hacking several banks in London. In 2018, after release from his previous sentence, he was convicted of further fraudulent activities and sentenced to 20 months.

Sunrise along with Weekend World were instrumental in organising the Freedom to Party demonstrations and the free parties that followed alongside Biology, Energy and Genesis.

<text>Jiwarli (also spelt Djiwarli, Tjiwarli) is an Australian Aboriginal language formerly spoken in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is a variety of the Mantharta language of the large Pama–Nyungan family. 

The last native speaker of Jiwarli, Jack Butler, died in April 1986. Prof Peter K. Austin (Linguistics Department, SOAS) collected all the available material on Jiwarli during fieldwork with Jack Butler 1978–1985. He has published a volume of texts on the language and a bilingual dictionary (Jiwarli-English with English-Jiwarli finderlist); both are currently out of print.

===Phonotactics===
Word-initially, only non-apical stops, nasals and glides are allowed; that is, words may only begin with one of {/p k j th m ng nh w y/}. Words may not begin with vowels.

All words end in vowels. Roots may end on a consonant, however -pa is added to all roots ending in l rl rr and -ma is added to all roots ending in a nasal that would violate the vowel-final word constraint.

<text>Heat exhaustion is a heat-related illness characterized by the body&#x27;s inability to effectively cool itself, typically occurring in high ambient temperatures or during intense physical exertion. In heat exhaustion, core body temperature ranges from 37 °C to 40 °C (98.6 °F to 104 °F). Symptoms include profuse sweating, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and lowered blood pressure, resulting from dehydration and serum electrolyte depletion. Heat-related illnesses lie on a spectrum of severity, where heat exhaustion is considered less severe than heat stroke but more severe than heat cramps and heat syncope.

Climate change and increasing global temperatures have led to more frequent and intense heat waves, raising the incidence of heat exhaustion. Risk factors include hot and humid weather, prolonged heat exposure, intense physical exertion, limited access to water or cooling, and certain medications that can exacerbate fluid and serum electrolyte losses including diuretics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, and antidepressants. Children, older adults, and individuals with certain pre-existing health conditions are more susceptible to heat exhaustion due to their reduced ability to regulate core body temperature.

Prevention strategies include wearing loose and lightweight clothing, avoiding strenuous activity in extreme heat, maintaining adequate hydration, and gradually acclimatizing to hot conditions. Public health measures, such as heat warnings and community cooling centers, also help prevent heat exhaustion during extreme weather events. Treatment involves moving to a cooler environment, rehydrating, and cooling the body. Untreated heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition characterized by a core body temperature above 40 °C (104 °F) and central nervous system dysfunction.

==Signs and symptoms==
=== Common ===
Sources:
* Elevated heart rate
* Lowered blood pressure
* Elevated core body temperature (not exceeding 40 °C or 104 °F)
* Elevated respiratory rate
* Profuse sweating
* Dehydration
* Serum electrolyte depletion
* Weakness and fatigue
* Persistent muscle cramps
* Skin tingling
* Nausea and vomiting
* Dizziness and light-headedness
* Irritability
* Headache

=== Less common ===
Sources:
* Pallor 
* Hot and dry skin
* Core body temperature exceeding 40 °C or 104 °F
* Syncope
* Central nervous system dysfunction (e.g., altered mental status, loss of spatial awareness, loss of bodily movement control, seizures, etc.)

=== Comparison with other heat-related illnesses ===
Common signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion can also be observed in other heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat syncope, and heat stroke. Heat cramps, a mild form of heat-related illness, is characterized by persistent abdominal, quadricipital, and calf muscle contractions. Heat syncope, also referred to as exercise-associated collapse, is a moderate form of heat-related illness characterized by a temporary loss of consciousness. Unlike heat exhaustion, heat cramps and heat syncope do not have systemic effects.

Heat exhaustion is a precursor to heat stroke, a severe form of heat-related illness. Heat stroke is more likely than heat exhaustion to cause pallor, hot and dry skin, syncope, and dysfunction of the central nervous system (e.g., altered mental status, loss of spatial awareness, loss of bodily movement control, seizures, etc.). Central nervous system dysfunction and a core body temperature exceeding 40 °C or 104 °F are the primary differentiators between heat exhaustion and heat stroke. One of the earliest indicators of heat stroke is altered mental status, which can manifest as delirium, confusion, reduced alertness, loss of consciousness, etc. Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent multi-organ failure and death.

== Physiology ==
The human body maintains a core body temperature at around 37 °C or 98.6 °F through mechanisms controlled by the thermoregulatory center within the hypothalamus. When the body is exposed to high ambient temperatures, intense physical exertion, or both, the thermoregulatory center will initiate several processes to dissipate more heat:

* Blood vessels near the skin surface dilate, increasing blood flow to the skin to facilitate heat loss through radiation and convection
* Heart rate increases to support elevated blood flow to the skin 
* Eccrine sweat glands in the skin produce sweat, which evaporates from the skin surface

=== Heat cramps and heat syncope ===
Heat-related illnesses lie on a spectrum of severity. Conditions on the lower end of this spectrum include heat cramps and heat syncope. The electrolyte depletion theory proposes that increased sweating during intense physical exertion in high ambient temperatures results in a depletion of serum electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, etc.) that causes sustained involuntary muscle contractions, or heat cramps. However, the contribution of intense physical exertion and high ambient temperatures to serum electrolyte depletion in the absence of significant dehydration has been contested by more recent research, which proposes an alternative theory. The neuromuscular theory proposes that muscle fatigue increases the excitability of α1 muscle spindles and decreases the inhibitory input from Golgi tendon organs, leading to sustained involuntary muscle contractions.

In heat syncope, or exercise-associated collapse, there is an increased dilation of blood vessels near the skin&#x27;s surface and a pooling of blood in the lower extremities due to a decrease in vasomotor tone, which is the extent of control over the constriction and dilation of blood vessels. This results in a drop in blood pressure when not lying down and a temporary reduction in blood flow to the brain, leading to fainting.

=== Heat exhaustion ===
Heat exhaustion is a moderate form of heat-related illness characterized by increasingly overwhelmed thermoregulatory mechanisms. In heat exhaustion, the core body temperature rises to between 37 °C and 40 °C (98.6 °F and 104 °F). To dissipate heat, blood flow to the skin can increase up to 8 liters per minute, accounting for a significant proportion of the cardiac output. This increase in peripheral circulation leads to a reduction in central blood volume—the volume of blood contained within the heart, lungs, and large blood vessels. The heart rate further increases, but the cardiac output and blood pressure continue to drop. At the same time, profuse sweating occurs, with losses up 1-2 liters of sweat per hour. This sweating exacerbates the reduction in central blood volume and leads to dehydration and serum electrolyte depletion, particularly hyponatremia (low serum sodium) and hypokalemia (low serum potassium). The combination of decreased blood flow to vital organs and serum electrolyte losses results in various symptoms, mentioned in &quot;Signs and symptoms.&quot; Additionally, the body&#x27;s respiratory rate increases to aid in heat dissipation through the lungs.

=== Heat stroke ===
Heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke, a severe form of heat-related illness characterized by complete failure of thermoregulatory mechanisms. Heat stroke is defined by two key features: a core body temperature above 40 °C (104 °F) and central nervous system dysfunction. In classic heat stroke, sweating ceases due to sweat gland dysfunction or depletion. This loss of evaporative cooling further accelerates heat accumulation. The resulting hyperthermia leads to widespread cellular dysfunction, including:

* Alterations in enzyme function
* Protein denaturation
* Disruption of cellular membranes.

Hyperthermia causes direct cellular damage, triggering a systemic inflammatory response. This inflammatory cascade can result in multi-organ dysfunction, potentially leading to:

* Acute kidney injury
* Liver failure
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation

==Causes==
There is increasing evidence linking higher temperatures to a variety of diseases and disorders as well as elevated mortality and morbidity rates. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that temperatures will rise by up to 1.5 °C in the future due to ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change exacerbates extreme temperatures, resulting in more intense and frequent heat waves. As this trend continues, populations with greater susceptibility to heat exhaustion, such as children, older adults, and individuals with chronic diseases, are at an increased risk.

Common causes of heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses include:

* Prolonged exposure to hot, sunny, or humid weather conditions
* Extended time spent in high-temperature environments without adequate cooling
* Engaging in strenuous activities through work, exercise, or sports, particularly in hot conditions
* Insufficient fluid intake leading to dehydration
* Overconsumption of fluids without adequate electrolyte replacement, leading to serum electrolyte depletion
* Wearing tight or non-breathable clothing that does not allow heat to escape, trapping heat close to the body
* Use of certain medications that impair thermoregulation, such as diuretics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, and antidepressants
* Sudden exposure to high temperatures without gradual acclimatization

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for heat exhaustion include:
* Wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing, hats, and helmets (e.g., football pads, turnout gear, etc.) that trap heat and impede cooling
* Higher body fat percentage, which can hinder heat dissipation
* Presence of fever, which elevates body temperature and lowers heat tolerance 
* Children younger than four years old and adults older than 65 are at a higher risk of serious heat illness due to impaired thermoregulation, even at rest, especially in hot and humid conditions without adequate cooling
* Insufficient access to water, air conditioning, or other cooling methods
* Use of medications that increase the risk of heat exhaustion, including diuretics, first-generation antihistamines, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, MDMA (&#x27;Ecstasy&#x27;, &#x27;Molly&#x27;), and other amphetamines

==Medication impact ==
Medications such as diuretics, antihypertensives, anticholinergics, and antidepressants can cause electrolyte imbalances, drug-induced hypohidrosis (reduced sweating), or drug-induced hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating). This disrupts the body&#x27;s ability to regulate core temperature and increases the risk of heat exhaustion.

Anticholinergic medications inhibit the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system involving the muscarinic M3 acetylcholine receptors, which often results in symptoms of dry mouth, increased thirst, as well as an increased risk of dehydration. Other medications containing anticholinergic properties, such as certain antidepressants and first-generation antihistamines, have comparable side effects. For patients at risk of or experiencing heat exacerbation, taking these medications can further increase their risk.

Certain antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as well as opioids that stimulate histamine release, can cause hyperhidrosis, leading to significant fluid and serum electrolyte depletion Though the mechanisms are not fully understood, antihypertensives such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics have shown to decrease heat tolerance. In addition, ACE inhibitors and diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances, increase thirst, and increase risk of dehydration Beta-blockers limit the body&#x27;s ability to redirect hyperthermic blood away from the body&#x27;s core and towards the skin for cooling. If dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are left untreated, they can lead to severe complications, progress to a more severe heat-related illness such as a heatstroke, and can potentially be fatal.

The management of drug-induced hypohidrosis and hyperhidrosis should be thoroughly evaluated and discussed with a healthcare professional. Treatment options may include discontinuation of the medication, a dose adjustment, a drug substitution to a different drug-class, adaptation to new behavioral and environmental changes, or the addition of another agent that can counteract the side effects.

== Special populations ==

=== Pediatrics ===
Children (under the age of 18 years old) have a lower heat tolerance compared to adults due to decreased homeostatic regulatory systems, increased metabolic rates, and decreased cardiac output. Strenuous exercise in high-temperature conditions is the leading cause of heat-related illness in children. The dehydration stemming from heat-related illness is what puts children at risk for thermoregulatory dysfunction. Thermoregulatory dysfunction only worsens the ability for children to fight heat exhaustion because it leads to decreased sweat capabilities and increased core temperature response. Similar to that of adults, the best way to combat and prevent heat exhaustion in children is to properly condition prior to exercise exertion, hydrate, allow for temperature adjustment, and clothe accordingly.

=== Pregnancy ===
Although there are not many studies on how the rates of heat exhaustion differ amongst the pregnant population, the adverse effects due to heat exhaustion in the pregnant population can be fatal. Heat exhaustion becomes much more common within pregnant women who perform the same tasks they had while not pregnant. While their symptoms are no different than the most common, such as dizziness, fatigue, and dehydration, the extreme adverse effects include increased preterm births, miscarriages, and birth defects. The reason for these more serious adverse effects is that pregnancy causes higher metabolic and cardiovascular demands, and the presence of heat exhaustion only amplifies these demands further. The dehydration symptom of heat exhaustion is vital to overcome because proper hydration is deeply necessary for proper development of the fetus and metabolic activity. To combat the dehydration aspect, the amount of water intake must be increased from the intake amount prior to pregnancy and hot environments should be avoided to prevent sweating.

==Prevention==
Ways to prevent and lower risk of heat exhaustion include:

* Public widespread announcements of heat waves or rapid increases in temperature
* Staying up to date on daily weather reports
* Heat shelters throughout communities
* Wearing loose fitting and lighter fabric clothing
* Try to stay well hydrated unless fluid intake is limited
* For those who are doing lots of outdoor activities or work, find shady cool areas to rest
* Avoid prolonged exposure to hot environments, such as tropical sunshine in the middle of the day, Mediterranean forests, or a boiler room
* Drink adequate fluids 
* Avoid exertion and exercise in hot weather 
* Avoid medications that can be detrimental to the regulation of body heat

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of heat exhaustion most commonly is diagnosed by medical professionals with various physical examinations. Through examination a person would have their temperature checked and questioned about their recent activity. If the medical professionals suspect a person&#x27;s heat exhaustion has progressed into heat stroke they may then lead with these varying tests to verify;

* Blood test, medical professionals when conducting a blood test look for low blood sugar or potassium. They may also look for the presence of unwanted gases in a person&#x27;s blood.
* Urinalysis, an urinalysis or urine test is a test to measure color, clarity, pH levels, glucose concentration, and protein levels. The test additionally can check a person&#x27;s kidney function, which is common to be affected by classic heat stroke.
* Muscle function tests, medical professionals use muscle function tests to check for rhabdomyolysis, which is severe damage to a person&#x27;s skeletal muscle tissue.

==Treatment==

===First aid===
First aid for heat exhaustion or heat stroke includes:
* Moving the person to a shaded, fanned, or air-conditioned place
* Removing any excess or tight clothing to facilitate cooling
* Applying wet towels or ice packs wrapped in cloth to the forehead, neck, armpits, and groin, and using a fan to cool the person down
* Lying the person down on their back and elevating their feet above head level to improve blood circulation
* Having the person drink cool water or sports drinks, also referred to as electrolyte drinks, provided they are conscious, alert, and not vomiting (Only applies to heat exhaustion)
* Turning the person on their side if they are vomiting to prevent choking
* Monitoring the person&#x27;s vital signs, which includes their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temperature
* Monitoring the person&#x27;s mental status (i.e., confusion, delirium, reduced alertness etc.)
* Contacting emergency medical services if their situation does not improve rapidly or worsens

===Emergency medical treatment===
If an individual with heat exhaustion receives medical treatment, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), doctors, and/or nurses may also:
* Provide supplemental oxygen
* Administer intravenous fluids and electrolytes if they are too confused to drink and/or are vomiting

=== Do Not ===
If an individual is experiencing heat exhaustion or any other heat related illness DO NOT:

* Administer fever medications such as aspirin or Tylenol as they can be harmful for the individual
* Administer salt tablets as they can worsen dehydration
* Use alcohol or caffeine containing products as they can make it harder for the individual to control their body temperature
* Give anything by mouth if the person is vomiting or unconscious

==Heat warning resources==
With high temperatures becoming more frequent, there are resources available to stay up to date on sudden changes in the weather. In the United States, OSHA in collaboration with the NIOSH have a Heat Safety Tool app that notifies their users with real time data on weather forecasts in a certain location, common side effects of heat related illnesses, and how the temperature feels like outside allowing individuals to safely plan out their day based on the weather. Additional resources include monitoring weather in your area of the United States based on zip code using weather.gov, being aware of cooling centers in your area, knowing how to save and use less energy within your household, and being well informed of certain populations who are more vulnerable to heat related illnesses than others. Apart from these resources, there are radio stations and news weather forecasts that continue to provide information on changes in the weather and temperature both globally and within your area.

==Prognosis==
After adequate rest and rehydration, most individuals typically recover from their heat exhaustion. However, when heat exhaustion is left untreated, the most common disease progression is heat stroke. According to the CDC, a typical trait indicating a person is having a heat stroke is when their body temperature reaches 104 °F or higher in a span of 10 to 15 minutes. In addition to a high body temperature, they will also experience central nervous system dysfunction such as alteration in their mental status and slurred speech. Another possible illness that heat stroke can lead to is rhabdomyolysis or rapid injury to skeletal muscle especially when heat stroke is caused by physical exertion. When an individual experiences rhabdomyolysis, that damaged skeletal tissue releases toxic muscle components such as myoglobin into the bloodstream and can cause issues such as coca cola colored urine, myalgia, and kidney damage due to the blocked tubules to name a few. If a person is experiencing a heat stroke and is not properly treated, that can further progress to metabolic abnormalities, irreversible damage to multiple organs in the body, and death as a result.

<doc id="714256" wikidata="Q7305170" url="?curid=714256" title="Red Thunder Cloud">
<text>Red Thunder Cloud (May 30, 1919January 8, 1996), born Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West, also known as Carlos Westez, was an American singer, dancer, storyteller, and field researcher. For a time he was promoted by anthropologists as &quot;the last fluent speaker of the Catawba language&quot; but he was later revealed to have learned what little he knew of the language from books. The grandson of a prominent African-American attorney and community leader, Red Thunder Cloud was an African American who reinvented himself as a Native American. 

Anthropologist Frank Speck said he believed Red Thunder Cloud to be a genuine Catawba Indian and proceeded to provide him with training in field methods of recording notes for ethnological studies. Speck insisted Thunder Cloud spoke the Catawba language, though Catawba leadership said he only knew &quot;a few words,&quot; that he had learned from Speck&#x27;s books. After &quot;Thunder Cloud&quot; died, and was revealed to be Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West, public confirmation came of what the Catawba leaders had already known: &quot;Red Thunder Cloud&quot; was neither Catawba nor Native American, and had never had any contact with the Catawba people until Speck introduced them. 

Despite doubts and skepticism about West from the communities he studied, West continued to represent himself as an expert on multiple Native cultures and languages. He continued to work for Speck, collecting ethnographic data and folklore from various Native American cultures, and collaborated with several other anthropologists to write about Native American cultures and languages with which he had also had no contact.

==Early life==

Red Thunder Cloud was born on May 30, 1919, as Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West in Newport, Rhode Island, to Cromwell Payne West of Pennsylvania and Roberta Hawkins West of Lynchburg, Virginia. Both were of African American descent. His maternal grandfather was William Ashbie Hawkins, one of the first African-American lawyers in Baltimore. From 1935 to 1937 West was employed by the Newport City wharf as a watchman and later as a chauffeur. 

In 1938, 19 year old West wrote a letter to Frank G. Speck, a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, claiming that he was a 16 year old Catawba Indian. He asked Speck for help in learning more about his people and told him that he had been interested in Native American culture since the fourth grade. He claimed that he was raised by the Narragansett tribe of Rhode Island and had lived with the Shinnecock tribe since 1937. In this letter he claimed that he learned the Catawba language from his grandmother, Ada McMechen. However, he also mentions Gatschet&#x27;s extensive, published work on the Catawba language, which is a far more likely source for his knowledge, as are the works of James Smith. The 19 year old West then proceeded to sign this letter with the name, &quot;Chief Red Thunder Cloud&quot;.

==Red Thunder Cloud identity==

West reinvented his identity at this point and lived the rest of his life as Red Thunder Cloud of the Catawba tribe. Frank Speck believed West to be a genuine Catawba Indian and employed him on small projects, collecting ethnographic data and folklore among Long Island Indians. He also collected data on the Montauk, Shinnecock, and Mashpee tribes for George Gustav Heye, founder of what became the National Museum of the American Indian.

In December 1943, West lived at the University of Pennsylvania for two weeks, providing what he convinced them was information on the Catawba tribe, recording music, and aiding in ethnobotanical research, despite not being Catawba himself, and having never visited a Catawba community. 

West only visited the Catawba Reservation in Rock Hill, South Carolina, for the first time in February 1944. He arrived with a letter of introduction from Speck. While Speck insisted that West &quot;spoke Catawba&quot;, he seems to have been alone in this claim; Chief Sam Blue, a native speaker of the Catawba language, said West only knew &quot;a few words of Catawba&quot; and that this small bit all seems to have come from Speck&#x27;s books.

According to Chief Gilbert Blue of the Catawba Nation, West met with his grandfather, Chief Sam Blue, as well as with Sally Gordon during his second visit to the reservation, which West reported lasting for six months. Other sources claim West was met with rejection by tribal leadership and was told to leave shortly after arriving. When interviewed in 1957 by William C. Sturtevant, Chief Sam Blue and his daughter-in-law Lillian said they did not believe West was Native American. &quot;Sam Blue thought [West] had learned the few words of Catawba that he knew from Speck&#x27;s books.&quot;

In a letter dated October 25, 1958, West offered assistance to Sturtevant in making contact with Indian groups in the eastern United States, notably the Wampanoag. His correspondence claimed that his mother was Catawba and his father was from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and came from Honduran and Puerto Rican parentage. West also stated that he spoke Spanish and Portuguese as well as Native American languages including &quot;Cayuaga, Seneca, Mohawk, Narragansett, Micmac, Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Creek, Choctaw, Sioux, and Winnebago&quot;. In addition, he claimed he was able to recognize other Indian languages when he heard them spoken.

==Marriage==
West was briefly married to Jean Marilyn Miller, who also went by &quot;Pretty Pony&quot; and was &quot;said to be a Blackfeet&quot;.

==Other activities==
In the late 1940s he self-published a newsletter called &quot;The Indian War Drum: The Voice of the Eastern Indians&quot;. 

In 1964 and 1965 he worked with G. Hubert Matthews, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was also able to convince Matthews that he could help document the Catawba language. Together they published five texts in 1967. Matthews included in these books West&#x27;s fabricated family genealogy, listing West&#x27;s nonexistent Catawba ancestors in his maternal line. West told Matthews his mother&#x27;s name was “Singing Dove” and that her father was “Strong Eagle,” saying the latter was a graduate of Yale Law School and had died in 1941. However, West&#x27;s mother was actually Roberta M. Hawkins West, and her father, William Ashbie Hawkins (1862-1941) was not only one of the first Black lawyers in Baltimore, but a prominent and well-known community leader, the son of the Rev. Robert Hawkins and Susan (Cobb) Hawkins, all very well-known, and well-documented African-American people. 

West continued to live under the Red Thunder Cloud pretendian identity, becoming a regular presence at local fairs and even some pow wows in New England, where he would sell his herbal products called &quot;Red Thunder Cloud&#x27;s Accabonac Princess American Indian Teas&quot;. 

==Death==
West died at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts following a stroke, January 8, 1996, at the age of 76. At the time of his death, Leonor Pena, a close friend from Central Falls, Rhode Island, gave his name as Carlos Westez and included the alias Namos S. Hatiririe. She listed his occupation as &quot;shaman&quot;. His sister, as administrator to his will in probate court, gave his name as Cromwell Ashbie Hawkins West.

==Investigation of identity==
Linguist and ethnologist Ives Goddard of the Smithsonian Institution confirmed that West was non-Native by way of public documents, letters, and publications. He concluded that &quot;West&#x27;s life as Red Thunder Cloud confronts us with basic questions of race and identity that are emblematic of our age.&quot; He compared West&#x27;s &quot;successful life-long masquerade&quot; to that of Grey Owl and Buffalo Child Long Lance
but added that West&#x27;s extensive involvement in the Catawba language &quot;leaves us as linguists with challenging problems of interpretation and evaluation.&quot;

<text>The Catawba, also known as Issa, Essa or Iswä but most commonly Iswa (Catawba: ), are a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans, known as the Catawba Indian Nation. Their current lands are in South Carolina, on the Catawba River, near the city of Rock Hill. Their territory once extended into North Carolina, as well, and they still have legal claim to some parcels of land in that state. They were once considered one of the most powerful Southeastern tribes in the Carolina Piedmont, as well as one of the most powerful tribes in the South as a whole, with other, smaller tribes merging into the Catawba as their post-contact numbers dwindled due to the effects of colonization on the region.

The Catawba were among the East Coast tribes who made selective alliances with some of the early European colonists, when these colonists agreed to help them in their ongoing conflicts with other tribes. These were primarily the tribes of different language families: the Iroquois, who ranged south from the Great Lakes area and New York; the Algonquian Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware); and the Iroquoian Cherokee, who fought for control over the large Ohio Valley (including what is in present-day West Virginia). During the American Revolutionary War the Catawba supported the American colonists against the British. Decimated by colonial smallpox epidemics, warfare and cultural disruption, the Catawba declined markedly in number in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some Catawba continued to live in their homelands in South Carolina, while others joined the Choctaw or Cherokee, at least temporarily.

Terminated as a tribe by the federal government in 1959, the Catawba Indian Nation had to reorganize to reassert their sovereignty and treaty rights. In 1973 they established their tribal enrollment and began the process of regaining federal recognition. In 1993 they regained federal recognition and won a $50 million Indian land claims settlement by the federal government and state of South Carolina. The state of South Carolina also recognized the tribe in 1993. Their headquarters are at Rock Hill, South Carolina.

, the population of the Catawba Nation has increased to about 2,600, most in South Carolina.

The Catawba language, part of the Siouan family (Catawban branch), is being revived.

== Name ==
The Catawba have also been known as &quot;Esaw&quot;, or &quot;Issa&quot; (Catawba &quot;iswä&quot;, &quot;river&quot;), named after their territory along the principal waterway of the region. Historically, &quot;Iswa&quot;, today the river is commonly known as the Catawba River from its headwaters in North Carolina and into South Carolina before continuing as the Wateree River in Fairfield county, South Carolina. The nations of the Iroquois frequently referred to the Catawba under the general term &quot;Totiri&quot;, or &quot;Toderichroone&quot;, also known as &quot;Tutelo&quot;.

==History==
People have lived in the area since the Paleoindian period (~10,000 B.C.). Pottery along the Catawba river corridor have been found that date to the Woodland period. The Catawba were the people who inhabited the area when Europeans first began to settle.

In the late 19th century, the ethnographer Henry Rowe Schoolcraft theorized that the Catawba had lived in Canada until driven out by the Iroquois (supposedly with French help) and that they had migrated to Kentucky and to Botetourt County, Virginia. He asserted that by 1660 they had migrated south to the Catawba River, competing in this territory with the Cherokee, a Southern Iroquoian language–speaking tribe who were based west of the French Broad River in southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, northwestern South Carolina, and northeastern Georgia.

However, early 20th-century anthropologist James Mooney later dismissed most elements of Schoolcraft&#x27;s account as &quot;absurd, the invention and surmise of the would-be historian who records the tradition.&quot; He pointed out that, aside from the French never having been known to help the Iroquois, the Catawba had been recorded by 1567 by the Spanish expedition under Juan Pardo as being in the same area of the Catawba River as was known to be their later territory. Mooney accepted the tradition that, following a protracted struggle, the Catawba and Cherokee had settled on the Broad River their mutual boundary.

The Catawba also had armed confrontations with several northern tribes, particularly the Haudenosaunee Seneca nation, and the Algonquian-speaking Lenape, with whom they competed for hunting resources and territory. The Catawba chased Lenape raiding parties back to the north in the 1720s and 1730s, going across the Potomac River. At one point, a party of Catawba is said to have followed a party of Lenape who attacked them, and to have overtaken them near Leesburg, Virginia. There they fought a pitched battle.

Similar encounters in these longstanding conflicts were reported to have occurred at present-day Franklin, West Virginia (1725), Hanging Rocks and the mouth of the Potomac South Branch in West Virginia, and near the mouths of Antietam Creek (1736) and Conococheague Creek in Maryland. Mooney asserted that the name of Catawba Creek in Botetourt came from an encounter in these battles with the northern tribes, not from the Catawba having lived there.

In 1721 the colonial governments of Virginia and New York held a council at Albany, New York, attended by delegates from the Six Nations (&quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;) and the Catawba. The colonists asked for peace between the Confederacy and the Catawba. The Six Nations reserved the land west of the Blue Ridge Mountains for themselves, including the Indian Road or Great Warriors&#x27; Path (later called the Great Wagon Road) through the Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia backcountry. This path was frequently traveled and was used until 1744 by Seneca war parties to pass through the Shenandoah Valley to raid in the South.

In 1738, a smallpox epidemic broke out in South Carolina. Endemic for centuries among Europeans, the infectious disease had been carried by them to North America, where it caused many deaths. The Catawba and other tribes, such as the Sissipahaw, suffered high mortality in these epidemics. In 1759, a smallpox epidemic killed nearly half the Catawba.

In 1744 the Treaty of Lancaster, made at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, renewed the Covenant Chain between the Iroquois and the colonists. The governments had not been able to prevent settlers going into Iroquois territory, but the governor of Virginia offered the tribe payment for their land claim. The peace was probably final for the Iroquois, who had established the Ohio Valley as their preferred hunting ground by right of conquest and pushed other tribes out of it.

Tribes located to the west continued warfare against the Catawba, who were so reduced that they could raise little resistance. In 1763, a small party of Algonquian Shawnee killed the noted Catawba chief, King Hagler, near his own village.

In 1763, the colonial government of South Carolina confirmed a reservation for the Catawba of , on both sides of the Catawba River, within the present York and Lancaster counties. When British troops approached during the American Revolutionary War in 1780, the Catawba withdrew temporarily into Virginia. They returned after the Battle of Guilford Court House, and settled in two villages on the reservation. These were known as Newton, the principal village, and Turkey Head, on the opposite side of the Catawba/Wateree River.

===19th century===
In 1826, the Catawba leased nearly half their reservation to whites for a few thousand dollars of annuity; their dwindling number of members (as few as 110 by an 1896 estimate) depended on this money for survival.

In 1840, by the Treaty of Nation Ford with South Carolina, the Catawba sold to the state all but of their reserved by the English Crown. They resided on the remaining square mile after the treaty. The treaty was invalid &quot;ab initio&quot; because the state did not have the right to make it, which was reserved for the federal government, and never gained Senate ratification. and did not get federal approval. About the same time, a number of the Catawba, dissatisfied with their condition among the whites, removed to join the remaining eastern Cherokee, who were based in far Western North Carolina. But, finding their position among their former enemies equally unpleasant, all but one or two soon returned to South Carolina. The last survivor of the westward migration, an elderly Catawba woman, died among the Cherokee in 1889. A few Cherokee intermarried with the Catawba in the region.

At a later period some Catawba removed to the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory and settled near present-day Scullyville, Oklahoma. They assimilated with the Choctaw and did not retain separate tribal identity. 
The Catawba fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. Nineteen men enlisted with the Confederate Army and saw combat across Virginia.

===Historical culture and estimated populations===
The Catawba are historically sedentary agriculturists, who have also fished and hunted for game. Their customs have been, and are, similar to neighboring Native Americans in the Piedmont region. Traditional game has included deer, crops grown have included corn, and the women in particular are noted makers of pottery and baskets, arts which they still preserve. They are believed to have the oldest surviving tradition of pottery East of the Mississippi, and possibly the oldest (or one of the oldest) on the American continent. 
Early Spanish explorers of the mid-16th century estimated the population of the Catawba as between 15,000 and 25,000 people. When the English first settled South Carolina about 1682, they estimated the Catawba at about 1,500 warriors, or about 4,600 people in total. Their decline was attributed to the mortality of infectious diseases. The English named the Catawba River and Catawba County after this indigenous people. By 1728, the Catawba had been reduced to about 400 warriors, or about 1400 persons in total. In 1738, they suffered from a smallpox epidemic, which also affected nearby tribes and the whites. In 1743, even after incorporating several small tribes, the Catawba numbered fewer than 400 warriors. In 1759, they again suffered from smallpox, and in 1761, had some 300 warriors, or about 1,000 people. By 1775 they had only 400 people in total; in 1780, they had 490; and, in 1784, only 250 were reported.

During the nineteenth century, their numbers continued to decline, to 450 in 1822, and a total of 110 people in 1826. As of 2006, their population had increased to about 2600.

==== Religion and culture ====
The customs and beliefs of the early Catawba were documented by the anthropologist Frank Speck in the twentieth century. In the Carolinas, the Catawba became well known for their pottery, which historically was made primarily by the women. Since the late 20th century, some men also make pottery.

In approximately 1883, tribal members were contacted by missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Numerous Catawba were converted to the church. Some left the Southeast to resettle with clusters of Mormons in Utah, Colorado, and neighboring western states.

The Catawba on their reserve in South Carolina hold a yearly celebration called &quot;Yap Ye Iswa&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Day of the People,&quot; or Day of the River People. Held at the Catawba Cultural Center, proceeds are used to fund the activities of the center.

===20th century to present===

The Catawba were electing their chief prior to the start of the 20th century. In 1909 the Catawba sent a petition to the United States government seeking to be given United States citizenship.

During President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, the federal government worked to improve conditions for Native Americans. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, tribes were encouraged to renew their governments to exercise more self-determination. The Catawba were not at that time a recognized Native American tribe as they had lost their land and did not have a reservation. In 1929 Samuel Taylor Blue, chief of the Catawba, had begun the process to gain federal recognition.

The Catawba were federally recognized as a Native American tribe in 1941, and they created a written constitution in 1944. Also in 1944 South Carolina granted the Catawba and other Native American residents of the state citizenship, but did not grant them the franchise, or right to vote. Like African Americans since the turn of the 20th century, the Native Americans were largely excluded from the franchise by discriminatory rules and practices associated with voter registration. They were prevented from voting until the late 1960s, after the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. It provided for federal oversight and enforcement of people&#x27;s constitutional right to vote.

In the 1950s, the federal government began to press what is known as the Indian termination policy, based on its perception that some tribes were assimilated enough not to need a special relationship with the government. It terminated the government of the Catawba in 1959. This cut off federal benefits, and communal property was allocated to individual households. The people became subject to state law. The Catawba decided that they preferred to be organized as a tribal community. Beginning in 1973, they applied to have their government federally recognized. Gilbert Blue served as their chief until 2007. They adopted a constitution in 1975 that was modeled on their 1944 version.

In addition, for decades the Catawba pursued various land claims against the government for the losses due to the illegal treaty made by South Carolina in 1840 and the failure of the federal government to protect their interests. This culminated in &quot;South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe, Inc.&quot;, where the United States Supreme Court ruled that the tribe&#x27;s land claims were subject to a statute of limitations which had not yet run out. In response, the Catawba prepared to file 60,000 lawsuits against individual landowners in York County to regain ownership of their land. On October 27, 1993, the U.S. Congress enacted the Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settlement Act of 1993 (Settlement Act), which reversed the &quot;termination&quot;, recognized the Catawba Indian Nation and, together with the state of South Carolina, settled the land claims for $50 million, to be applied toward economic development for the Nation.

On July 21, 2007, the Catawba held their first elections in more than 30 years. Of the five members of the former government, only two were reelected.

In the 2010 census, 3,370 people identified as having Catawba ancestry.

==Catawba Indian Nation Land Trust==
The Catawba Reservation () is located in two disjointed sections in York County, South Carolina, east of Rock Hill. Covering a total of , it reported a 2010 census population of 841 inhabitants. It also has a congressionally established service area in North Carolina, covering Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Gaston, Union, Cleveland, and Rutherford counties. The Catawba also own a site in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, which they will develop for a gaming casino and mixed-use entertainment complex.

Today the Catawba earn most of their revenue from Federal/State funds.

===Gaming relations with South Carolina===
Under the terms of the 1993 Settlement Act, the Catawba waived its right to be governed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Instead, the Catawba agreed to be governed by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the State Act as pertains to games of chance; which at the time allowed for video poker and bingo. In 1996, the Catawba formed a joint venture partnership with D.T. Collier of SPM Resorts, Inc. of Myrtle Beach, to manage their bingo and casino operations. That partnership, New River Management and Development Company, LLC (of which the Catawba were the majority owner) operated the Catawba&#x27;s bingo parlor in Rock Hill. In 1999, the South Carolina General Assembly passed a statewide ban on the possession and operation of video poker devices.

When in 2004 the Catawba entered into an exclusive management contract with SPM Resorts, Inc., to manage all new bingo facilities, some tribal citizens were critical. The new contract was signed by the former governing body immediately prior to new elections. In addition, the contract was never brought before the General Council (the full tribal membership) as required by their existing constitution. After the state established the South Carolina Education Lottery in 2002, the tribe lost gambling revenue and decided to shut down the Rock Hill bingo operation. They sold the facility in 2007.

In 2006, the bingo parlor, located at the former Rock Hill Mall on Cherry Road, was closed. The Catawba filed suit against the state of South Carolina for the right to operate video poker and similar &quot;electronic play&quot; devices on their reservation. They prevailed in the lower courts, but the state appealed the ruling to the South Carolina Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court overturned the lower court ruling. The tribe appealed that ruling to the United States Supreme Court, but in 2007 the court declined to hear the appeal, leaving the state supreme court in place. In 2014, the Supreme Court of South Carolina ruled similarly against the tribe in regards of the state&#x27;s Gambling Cruise Act.

In 2014, the Catawba made a second attempt to operate a bingo parlor, opening one at what was formerly a BI-LO, on Cherry Road in Rock Hill. It closed in 2017, unable to turn a profit.

===Gaming relations with North Carolina===
On September 9, 2013, the Catawba announced plans to build a $600 million casino along Interstate 85 in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. Cleveland County officials quickly endorsed the plans. But Governor Pat McCrory, over 100 North Carolina General Assembly members and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) opposed it.

The Catawba submitted the required acquisition application to the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) in August 2013, seeking to have the US place this property of in trust, but their application was denied in March 2018. In September, the Catawba submitted a new application under the discretionary process; they also pursued a Congressional route. Senate bill 790, introduced by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, with support of North Carolina senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr, would have authorized the DOI to take the land into trust for gaming, but the bill died in committee.

On March 13, 2020, the DOI announced its decision to approve the 2018 discretionary application and place the land in North Carolina in trust. On March 17, the EBCI filed a federal suit challenging the DOI decision in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia. AS is customary, the suit names the DOI, the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, Secretary David Bernhardt, and several other department officials. In addition, the Catawba filed a motion to intervene to join the defendants. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma filed a motion to support the EBCI; both motions were approved.

In May 2020, the EBCI filed an amended complaint in its federal lawsuit, saying that the DOI&#x27;s approval of the trust land resulted from a scheme by casino developer Wallace Cheves. He was said to have persuaded the Catawba to lend their name to the scheme, and had a history of criminal and civil enforcement actions against him and his companies for illegal gambling. It said that the DOI disregarded early consultation with the EBCI and skipped an Environmental Impact Assessment. The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma also filed an amended complaint, seeking to protect cultural artifacts on their ancestral land where the casino is planned.

On January 24, 2021, Governor Roy Cooper signed a revenue-sharing compact with the Catawba Nation, which allows for Class III gaming and wagering on sports and horse racing; the compact is similar to the one signed between the state and the EBCI. On March 19, a letter from Darryl LaCounte, Acting Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, notified the Catawba Nation and Governor Roy Cooper that the agency has signed off on the agreement; it stated that the pact complies with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and other provisions of federal law. On April 16, the Catawba Nation received a victory in federal court, as U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found no basis for the Cherokees&#x27; claims in the lawsuit. Catawba Two Kings Casino opened on July 1, 2021, with a temporary modular facility containing 500 slot machines in Kings Mountain.

==Citizenship==
Citizens of the Catawba Nation must be of lineal descent from a tribal citizen listed on at least one of the three tribal rolls taken in 1943, 1961, and 2000. The tribe does not use blood quantum to determine citizenship.

<text>An intraocular lens (IOL) is a lens implanted in the eye usually as part of a treatment for cataracts or for correcting other vision problems such as near-sightedness (myopia) and far-sightedness (hyperopia); a form of refractive surgery. If the natural lens is left in the eye, the IOL is known as &quot;phakic&quot;, otherwise it is a &quot;pseudophakic&quot; lens (or false lens). Both kinds of IOLs are designed to provide the same light-focusing function as the natural crystalline lens. This can be an alternative to LASIK, but LASIK is not an alternative to an IOL for treatment of cataracts.

IOLs usually consist of a small plastic lens with plastic side struts, called haptics, to hold the lens in place in the capsular bag inside the eye. IOLs were originally made of a rigid material (PMMA), although this has largely been superseded by the use of flexible materials, such as silicone. Most IOLs fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as a multifocal intraocular lens that provides multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs that provide limited visual accommodation. Multifocal IOLs can also be trifocal IOLs or extended depth of focus (EDOF) lenses.

As of 2021, nearly 28 million cataract procedures take place annually worldwide. That is about 75,000 procedures per day globally. The procedure can be done under local or topical anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible IOL enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsular bag through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches. This procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist, and the recovery period is about 2–3 weeks. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for 3 weeks to monitor the implants.

IOL implantation carries several risks associated with eye surgeries, such as infection, loosening of the lens, lens rotation, inflammation, nighttime halos and retinal detachment. Though IOLs enable many patients to have reduced dependence on glasses, most patients still rely on glasses for certain activities, such as reading. These reading glasses may be avoided in some cases if multifocal IOLs, trifocal IOLs or EDOF lenses are used.

==Medical uses==
Intraocular lenses have been used since 1999 for correcting larger errors in near-sighted, far-sighted, and astigmatic eyes. This type of IOL is also called phakic intraocular lens (PIOL), as it is implanted without removing the patient&#x27;s natural crystalline lens.

Phakic IOL appear to be lower risk than excimer laser surgery (LASIK) in those with significant near-sightedness.

More commonly, IOLs are implanted via &quot;Clear Lens Extraction And Replacement&quot; (CLEAR) surgery, also known as refractive lens exchange (RLE) or clear lens extraction (CLE). During CLEAR, the crystalline lens is extracted and an IOL replaces it in a process that is very similar to cataract surgery: both involve lens replacement, local anesthesia, last approximately 30 minutes, and require making a small incision in the eye for lens insertion. People recover from CLEAR surgery 1–7 days after the operation. During this time, they should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly raises blood pressure. They should visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several weeks to monitor the IOL implants.

CLEAR has a 90% success rate (risks include wound leakage, infection, inflammation, and astigmatism). CLEAR can be performed only on patients ages 40 and older. This is to ensure that eye growth, which disrupts IOL lenses, will not occur post-surgery.

Once implanted, IOLs have three major benefits. First, they are an alternative to the excimer laser procedure (LASIK), a form of eye surgery that does not work for people with serious vision problems. Effective IOL implants also eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses post-surgery for most patients. Cataracts will not appear or return, as the lens has been removed. The disadvantage is that the eye&#x27;s ability to change focus (accommodate) has generally been reduced or eliminated, depending on the kind of lens implanted.

Some of the risks that were found in the early 2000s during a three-year study of the Artisan lenses were:
* a yearly loss of 1.8% of the endothelial cells,
* 0.6% risk of retinal detachment,
* 0.6% risk of cataract (other studies have shown a risk of 0.5–1.0%), and
* 0.4% risk of corneal swelling.

Other risks include:
* 0.03–0.05% eye infection risk, which in worst case can lead to blindness. (This risk exists in all eye surgery procedures and is not unique to IOLs.)
* glaucoma,
* astigmatism,
* remaining near- or far-sightedness,
* rotation of the lens inside the eye one or two days after surgery.

Toric IOLs must be of the correct power and aligned inside the eye on a meridian that counteracts the preexisting astigmatism. One of the causes of unsatisfactory refractory correction is that the lens may be incorrectly placed by the surgeon, or rotate inside the eye if is too short, which may occur if the eye was incorrectly measured, or because the sulcus has a slightly oval shape. If misaligned, preexisting astigmatism may not be corrected completely or may even increase.

When standard IOLs are implanted with a CLEAR procedure, in substitution of the patient&#x27;s crystalline, astigmatism is typically not corrected, as astigmatism is mainly attributable to a deformation of the cornea. Toric IOLs may be used during the CLEAR procedure to correct astigmatism.

The surgeon can ascertain the astigmatic, or steepest, meridian in a number of ways, including manifest refraction or corneal topography. Manifest refraction is the familiar test where the eye doctor rotates lenses in front of the eye, asking the patient, &quot;Which is better (or clearer), this one or this one?&quot; Corneal topography is considered a more quantitative test, and for purposes of aligning a toric IOL, most surgeons use a measurement called simulated keratometry (SimK), which is calculated by the internal programming of the corneal topography machine, to determine the astigmatic meridian on the surface of the cornea. The astigmatic meridian can also be identified using corneal wavefront technology or paraxial curvature matching.

===Indications for refractive lens exchange===

Severe myopia or hyperopia with coexisting presbyopia are the primary indicators for refractive lens exchange (RLE), as RLE leads to complete loss of accommodation. Underlying regular astigmatism can also be managed by RLE, even beyond the scope of corneal incisional techniques, by toric lens implants. Marginal indications for RLE are presbyopia without ametropia, using a multifocal lens implant, presbyopia with underlying astigmatism, and prepresbyopoa hyperopia of from +5 to +10 D not amenable to keratorefractive surgery or phakic IOL due to a shallow anterior chamber.

====Complications====
Complications of RLE are similar to those after cataract surgery, but with the difference that RLE is often used in very short or very long eyes and patients’ ages tend to be significantly lower, so consideration must be given to longer-term effects.

==Type of surgery==
Implants can be used with or without removal of the natural crystalline lens: 
* &quot;Phakia&quot; is the presence of the natural crystalline lenses. Phakic IOL (PIOL) refers to an intraocular lens implanted without removal of the original crystalline lens, and this is performed solely to correct refractive error.
* Aphakia is the absence of the natural crystalline lens. The aphakic state is usually due to surgery to remove a cataractous lens, but post-surgical aphakia is rare nowadays because of the ubiquity of intraocular lenses. Rarely, aphakia can be post-traumatic or congenital in nature. Aphakic IOL refers to a lens implanted secondarily in an eye already aphakic from previous surgery or trauma.
* &quot;Pseudophakia&quot; is the substitution of the natural crystalline lens with an IOL, as is often done after cataract extraction or less often to correct major refractive error. Pseudophakic IOL refers to a lens implanted during cataract surgery, immediately after removal of the patient&#x27;s crystalline lens.

Many aphakic and pseudophakic IOLs such as anterior chamber IOLs or 3-piece posterior chamber IOLs can be used interchangeably. The exception are one piece IOLs, which must be placed within the capsular bag at the time of cataract surgery and hence cannot be used as secondary implants.

===Location of implant===
* &quot;Posterior chamber IOL&quot; (&quot;PCIOL&quot;). This is by far the most common type of implanted lens after cataract surgery, as this is the natural and optimum position for a lens.
* &quot;Anterior chamber IOL&quot; (&quot;ACIOL&quot;). A less-common type of intraocular lens, which is sometimes used if a PCIOL is not an option for a patient or if the situation requires a phakic IOL (PIOL).

==Pseudophakic IOLs==
Pseudophakic IOLs are lenses implanted during cataract surgery, immediately after removal of the patient&#x27;s crystalline lens.

===Monofocal===
Monofocal IOLs are standard lenses used in cataract surgery. One of the major disadvantages of these conventional IOLs is that they can only be focused for one particular distance – either optical infinity (rendering the eye emmetropic) or a fixed finite distance (rendering the eye myopic). Patients who undergo a standard IOL implantation no longer experience clouding from cataracts, but they are unable to accommodate (change focus from near to far, far to near, and to distances in between). This is not a concern for most cataract surgeries, as they are primarily performed on elderly people that are already completely presbyopic. However, it can be a problem for patients that are not yet presbyopic (or are in the early stages of presbyopia) undergoing refractive lens exchange for the sake of correcting refractive errors. monovision, in which one eye is made emmetropic and the other myopic, can partially compensate for the loss of accommodation and enable clear vision at multiple distances. More versatile types of lenses (multifocal and accommodating IOLs) were introduced in 2003 in the United States, with the approval by the Food and Drug Administration. These come at an additional cost to the recipient beyond what Medicare will pay and each has advantages and disadvantages.

===Multifocal===

Multifocal IOLs attempt to provide simultaneous viewing of distance vision and near vision. Trifocal IOLs can provide intermediate vision in addition. Many multifocal IOL designs attempt to achieve this simultaneous viewing focus using a concentric ring design, which alternates distance and near focal points. However, concentric ring multifocal lenses are prone to glare and mildly compromised focus at all ranges of vision.

People who have a multifocal IOL after their cataract is removed may be less likely to need additional glasses compared with people who have standard monofocal lenses. However, people receiving multifocal lenses may experience more visual problems than with monofocal lenses.
The most common adverse visual effects from multifocal IOLs include glare, halos (rings around lights), and a loss of contrast sensitivity in low-light conditions.

===Adjustable lens===
An adjustable IOL is unlike any other lens as its prescription power can be adjusted after surgery once all healing is complete. All other IOLs require surgeons to use pre-surgery measurements to determine a patient&#x27;s post-surgery lens power. The drawback of this is that pre-surgery measurements are taken while a patient still has cataracts, and they cannot account for minuscule shifts that occur during healing. An adjustable IOL allows surgeons to implant it and then, once healing is complete, use an ultraviolet light delivery device to fine tune it until it suits the patient. An early example being the (RxSight) Light Adjustable Lens (LAL).

The eyes and lenses must not be exposed to random ultraviolet light before and during the adjustment process, and protective glasses must be worn from the operation until the lens is locked. When the eye has healed, which is usually 2 to 4 weeks after IOL implantation, refraction adjustment is done. A prescription is formulated for the patient and customization of the IOL&#x27;s refractive power is done by exposing either the centre or the periphery of the lens to a metered dose of UV light, with the help of a contact lens on the cornea. This exposed part will swell slightly, adjusting the lens surface curvature. Meridional exposure can be done in much the same way to correct for astigmatism. Several exposures can be made for fine tuning, spaced over several days. Once the lens has been optimised a final exposure of the whole lens is made to lock the changes, after which the lens will no longer be adjustable and can be used outdoors.

===Accommodating===

Some newer lens designs attempt to allow the eye to regain some ability to change focus from distance to near (accommodation). However, many accommodating IOLs used today only achieve a very limited improvements in near vision which reduced over time. Accommodative intraocular lenses may also have a slightly higher risk of developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO), though there is some uncertainty around this finding. PCO is a common side-effect of many cataract surgeries and is easily treatable with a one-time laser capsulotomy procedure (see below).

Accommodating IOLs interact with ciliary muscles and zonules, using hinges at both ends to &quot;latch on&quot; and move forward and backward inside the eye using the same nerves and musculature as normal accommodation. These IOLs have a 4.5-mm square-edged optic and a long-hinged plate design with polyimide loops at the end of the haptics. The hinges are made of an advanced silicone called BioSil that was thoroughly tested to make sure it was capable of unlimited flexing in the eye.

An accommodating lens made by Eyeonics, now Bausch &amp; Lomb, was approved by the US FDA in 2003. The &quot;Crystalens&quot; has two hinged struts on opposite edges which displace the lens along the optical axis when an inward transverse force is applied to the haptic loops at the outer ends of the struts (the components transferring the movement of the contact points to the device), and it springs back when the force is reduced. It is implanted in the eye&#x27;s lens capsule, where the contractions of the ciliary body which would focus the eye with the natural lens are used to focus the implant.

===Toric===
A toric IOL is a type of toric lens used to correct preexisting corneal astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. Astigmatism can also be treated with limbal relaxing incisions or an excimer laser procedure. About 40% of Americans have significant astigmatism and thus may be candidates for a toric IOL. Cataract surgery with implantation of a toric IOL is essentially the same as cataract surgery with a conventional IOL. Like toric contact lenses, toric IOLs have different powers in different meridians of the lens, and they must be positioned on the correct meridian to reverse the preexisting astigmatism. If the toric IOL is not on the correct meridian, it may need to be repositioned in a second procedure.

===Multifocal toric===
Standard toric IOLs are monofocal, permanently focused on distant objects. Multifocal toric IOLs are also available. These lenses provide the patient not only with correction of preexisting astigmatism, but also with vision that can focus at far and short distances, including short reading distance.

===Extended depth-of-focus===
Extended depth-of-focus (EDOF) is an intraocular lens technology for treating presbyopia. Where multifocal IOLs have two or more focal points, EDOF lenses form a single elongated focal point to enhance depth of focus. The intention is to reduce glare, halos, and other photic phenomena which occur with multifocal IOLs. A possible drawback is decrease in image quality due to aberrations. EDOF IOLs have often been combined with multifocus designs, which has caused some confusion. It has been suggested that lenses combining more than one optical design be termed &quot;hybrid IOLs&quot;.

The principle on which they work is to form a single, axially elongated focal point, unlike monofocal lenses which have a single focal point, and multifocal lenses which have two or more stacked discrete focal points. The elongated zone of focus is intended to prevent the overlapped out-of-focus images of the multifocal lens which cause the halo effect. When matched correctly to the eye, these lenses are intended to have little effect on distance vision, and improve middle distance and near vision. In practice they have been satisfactory for intermediate distances, but not good enough for near vision. Spherical aberration and the pinhole effect have been used to produce the elongated focal zone. In effect, accurate focus at any distance is compromised to achieve less noticeable blur at all distances.

==Phakic IOLs==

Phakic IOLs (PIOLs) are intraocular lenses which are placed in an eye that still contains a natural human crystalline lens. PIOLs are sometimes referred to as an &#x27;implantable contact lenses&#x27; (ICLs). As with other IOLs, PIOLs can be either spheric or toric. Toric PIOLs have to be aligned with the meridian of astigmatism; toric IOL misalignment or rotation can lead to residual or even greater astigmatism postoperatively.

Depending on their attachment site to the eye, PIOLs can be divided into three categories:
* &quot;Angle-supported PIOLs&quot;, placed in the anterior chamber. They are notorious for their negative impact on the corneal endothelial lining, which is vital for maintaining a healthy clear cornea.
* &quot;Iris-fixated PIOLs&quot;, attached by claws to the mid-peripheral iris by a technique called enclavation. It is believed to have a lesser effect on corneal endothelium. The main complication with this type is their tendency to cause endothelial cell reduction.
* &quot;Sulcus-supported PIOLs&quot;, placed in the posterior chamber in front of the natural crystalline lens. This type of PIOLs is gaining more and more popularity. They have special vaulting so as not to be in contact with the normal lens. The main complication with older versions was a small possibility of cataract formation.

In 2006, a centrally perforated ICL (i.e., the Hole-ICL) was created to improve aqueous humour circulation.

==Blue-light filtering IOLs==
Blue-light filtering IOLs filter the UV and high-energy blue light present in natural and artificial light, both of which can cause vision problems; however, too much filtering of blue light can increase depression, especially in the winter months (SAD). The trademarked &quot;Natural Yellow&quot; material is available in three hydrophilic IOLs. Dr. Patrick H. Benz of Benz Research and Development created the first IOL material to incorporate the same UV-A blocking and violet light filtering chromophore that&#x27;s present in the human crystalline lens in order to attempt to protect the retina after cataract extraction of the natural crystalline lens.

A Cochrane Review found little evidence of important differences between blue‐light filtering and non‐blue‐light filtering lenses for protecting the macula (back of the eye) after cataract surgery. This may have been due to studies being too small and too short‐term to provide reliable results.

==Posterior capsule opacification==
Posterior capsule opacification (PCO), often referred to as &quot;after cataract&quot;, is the most common complication of cataract surgery.

In a small percentage of patients, posterior chamber intraocular lenses may form PCOs a few months after implantation. They are easily treatable, and typically only require a one-time capsulotomy procedure (using a ) to clarify.

==Materials==

The materials that have been used to manufacture intraocular lens implants include poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), silicone, hydrophobic acrylate, hydrophilic acrylate and collamer. PMMA was the first material to be used successfully in intraocular lenses.

Advances in technology have brought about the use of silicone and acrylic polymers, both of which are soft foldable inert materials. This allows the lens to be folded and inserted into the eye through a smaller incision. Specifically, acrylic lenses are a better choice in people who have a history of uveitis or are likely to have to undergo retinal surgery requiring vitrectomy with replacement by silicone oil, such as persons with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or who are at high risk of retinal detachment, such as persons with high myopia. A study found that in participants with a history of uveitis, eyes treated with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were over twice as likely to have a best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or more, compared to eyes treated with silicone IOLs.

==Selection of refractive power==
The appropriate refractive power of the IOL is selected, much like a spectacle lens prescription, to provide the desired refractive outcome. Pre-operative measurements, including corneal curvature, axial length, and white-to-white measurements are used to estimate the required power of the IOL. These methods include several formulae, including Hagis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Holladay 2, and SRK/T. Free online calculators use similar input data. A history of LASIK surgery requires different calculations to take this into account. Refractive results using power calculation formulae based on pre-operative biometrics leave people within 0.5 dioptres of target (correlates to visual acuity of 6/7.5 (20/25) when targeted for distance) in 55% of cases and within one dioptre (correlates to 6/12 (20/40) when targeted for distance) in 85% of cases. Developments in intra-operative wavefront technology have demonstrated power calculations that provide improved outcomes, yielding 80% of patients within 0.5 dioptres (7/7.5 (20/25) or better).

==History==

Sir Harold Ridley was the first to successfully implant an intraocular lens on 29 November 1949, at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital at London. That lens was manufactured by the Rayner company of Brighton, East Sussex, England from Perspex CQ polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) made by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries). Ridley had observed that Royal Air Force pilots who sustained eye injuries during World War II involving PMMA windshield material did not show any rejection or foreign body reaction, and deduced that the transparent material was inert and useful for implantation in the eye.

The intraocular lens did not find widespread acceptance in cataract surgery until the 1970s, when further developments in lens design and surgical techniques had come about.

As of 2021, approximately four million cataract procedures take place annually in the U.S. and nearly 28 million worldwide, a large proportion in India. That is about 75,000 procedures per day globally.

<doc id="714263" wikidata="Q938636" url="?curid=714263" title="Francis Bouillon">
<text>Francis Joseph Bouillon (born October 17, 1975) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens and Nashville Predators. He also played a season for HC Ambrì-Piotta in the National League A (NLA), the top-tier league in Switzerland. He is currently a Development Coach for the Montreal Canadiens.

==Early life==
Bouillon was born in New York City to a Haitian father and a French Canadian mother. Bouillon moved to Quebec City, Quebec with his mother when he was only 3 years old. He played Junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with the Laval Titans and the Granby Predateurs. He was Granby&#x27;s captain when they won the 1996 Memorial Cup.

==Playing career==
Francis made his professional debut the 1996–97 season in the ECHL with the Wheeling Nailers and played the following season in the IHL with the Quebec Rafales before he was signed as a free agent to an NHL contract by the Montreal Canadiens in 1998.

He played the next 11 seasons, the majority of his career (except for a short stint with the Predators in 2002–03) within the Canadiens organization. At 5&#x27;8&quot; and 194 lbs, Bouillon is considered small for an NHL defenseman but is never one to shy away from physical play. According to Pierre Houde, he is one of the strongest players in the NHL as shown by official physical tests.

On September 30, 2009, just prior to the 2009–10 season, Bouillon was signed to a one-year contract as a late inclusion to the Nashville Predators after joining the team on a tryout for training camp. In returning to the Predators after an initial four-game stint in 2002, Bouillon established himself within the Predators defense as a stay-at-home defenseman to appear in 81 games, missing only a single game, for 3 goals and 11 points. On June 18, 2010, he signed a two-year extension to remain with the Predators.

On July 1, 2012, Bouillon signed a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Montreal Canadiens. His play during that season earned him a one-year extension with the team. Following the 2013–14 season, the Canadiens declined to offer Bouillon a contract and on July 1, 2014, he became an unrestricted free agent. Bouillon attended the Canadiens&#x27; training camp for the 2014–15 season on a tryout, but was released by the team on October 6, 2014. On October 14, 2014, he signed with HC Ambrì-Piotta in the Swiss National League A.

He announced his retirement on September 25, 2015.

==Personal life==
Bouillon is married with two sons.

<doc id="714266" wikidata="Q37558" url="?curid=714266" title="Border Terrier">
<text>The Border Terrier is a British breed of small, rough-coated terrier. It originates from the area of the Anglo-Scottish border, and shares ancestry with the Dandie Dinmont Terrier and the Bedlington Terrier from the same area. The dogs were traditionally used in fox-hunting, and worked with the Border Hunt in Northumberland.

The breed was officially recognised by The Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1920, and by the American Kennel Club in 1930.

== History ==

Originally the Border Terrier was referred to as the Coquetdale Terrier or Redesdale Terrier from the area in which it evolved, but by the late 1800s it was generally known as the Border Terrier, probably because of its long history with the Border Hunt in Northumberland.

It shares its ancestry with that of the Bedlington Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. It was recognised as a breed by the Kennel Club in 1920, the same year The Border Terrier Club was formed. Their original purpose was to bolt foxes which had gone to ground. They were also used to kill rodents, but they have been used to hunt otters and badgers too.

The first Kennel Club Border Terrier ever registered was The Moss Trooper, a dog sired by Jacob Robson&#x27;s Chip in 1912 and registered in the Kennel Club&#x27;s Any Other Variety listing in 1913. The Border Terrier was rejected for formal Kennel Club recognition in 1914, but won its slot in 1920, with the first standard being written by Jacob Robson and John Dodd. Jasper Dodd was made first President of the club.

In 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC, while it ranked tenth in the United Kingdom.

In 2008, the Border Terrier ranked eighth in number of registrations by the UK Kennel Club.

== Characteristics ==
The Border Terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which travelled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that travelled with them were not small enough to do the Border Terrier&#x27;s job.

Border Terriers have a broad skull and moderately short muzzle, and strong teeth. The V-shaped ears are on the sides of the head and fall towards the cheeks. Common coat colours are grizzle-and-tan, blue-and-tan, red, or wheaten. Whiskers are few and short. The tail is moderately short, thick at the base and tapering.

Narrow-bodied and well-proportioned, males stand at the shoulder, and weigh ; females and .

The Border Terrier has a double coat consisting of a short, dense, soft undercoat and harsh, wiry weather- and dirt-resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave.

== Health ==

Canine epileptoid cramping syndrome is a condition that is recognised to occur in the Border Terrier.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

A UK study found a predisposition to gall bladder disease in the Border Terrier. The breed was found to be 86.48 times more likely to acquire gall bladder mucocele and 28.7 times more likely to acquire other forms of gall bladder disease compared to other dogs. The study also found a predisposition to neutrophilic cholangitis, with the breed being 12.07 times more likely to acquire it.

<doc id="714268" wikidata="Q1027995" url="?curid=714268" title="Pyloric stenosis">
<text>Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the opening from the stomach to the first part of the small intestine (the pylorus). Symptoms include projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. This most often occurs after the baby is fed. The typical age that symptoms become obvious is two to twelve weeks old.
The cause of pyloric stenosis is unclear. Risk factors in babies include birth by cesarean section, preterm birth, bottle feeding, and being firstborn. The diagnosis may be made by feeling an olive-shaped mass in the baby&#x27;s abdomen. This is often confirmed with ultrasound.
Treatment initially begins by correcting dehydration and electrolyte problems. This is then typically followed by surgery, although some treat the condition without surgery by using atropine. Results are generally good in both the short term and the long term.
About one to two per 1,000 babies are affected, and males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition is very rare in adults. The first description of pyloric stenosis was in 1888, with surgical management first carried out in 1912 by Conrad Ramstedt. Before surgical treatment, most babies with pyloric stenosis died.

==Signs and symptoms==
Babies with this condition usually present any time in the first weeks to 6 months of life with progressively worsening vomiting. It is more likely to affect the first-born with males more commonly than females at a ratio of 4 to 1. The vomiting is often described as non-bile stained (&quot;non bilious&quot;) and &quot;projectile vomiting&quot;, because it is more forceful than the usual spitting up (gastroesophageal reflux) seen at this age. Some infants present with poor feeding and weight loss but others demonstrate normal weight gain. Dehydration may occur which causes a baby to cry without having tears and to produce less wet or dirty diapers due to not urinating for hours or for a few days. Symptoms usually begin between 3 and 12 weeks of age. Findings include epigastric fullness with visible peristalsis in the upper abdomen from the infant&#x27;s left to right. Constant hunger, belching, and colic are other possible signs that the baby is unable to eat properly.

==Causes==
Rarely, infantile pyloric stenosis can occur as an autosomal dominant condition. It is uncertain whether it is a congenital anatomic narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle.

==Pathophysiology==
The gastric outlet obstruction due to the hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and gastric secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity may be involved in the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.

Persistent vomiting results in loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The vomited material does not contain bile because the pyloric obstruction prevents entry of duodenal contents (containing bile) into the stomach. The chloride loss results in a low blood chloride level which impairs the kidney&#x27;s ability to excrete bicarbonate. This is the factor that prevents correction of the alkalosis leading to metabolic alkalosis.

A secondary hyperaldosteronism develops due to the decreased blood volume. The high aldosterone levels causes the kidneys to avidly retain Na+ (to correct the intravascular volume depletion), and excrete increased amounts of K+ into the urine (resulting in a low blood level of potassium).The body&#x27;s compensatory response to the metabolic alkalosis is hypoventilation resulting in an elevated arterial pCO2.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is via a careful history and physical examination, often supplemented by radiographic imaging studies. Pyloric stenosis should be suspected in any infant with severe vomiting. On physical exam, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a mass in the epigastrium. This mass, which consists of the enlarged pylorus, is referred to as the &#x27;olive&#x27;, and is sometimes evident after the infant is given formula to drink. Rarely, there are peristaltic waves that may be felt or seen (video on NEJM) due to the stomach trying to force its contents past the narrowed pyloric outlet.

Most cases of pyloric stenosis are diagnosed/confirmed with ultrasound, if available, showing the thickened pylorus and non-passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum. Muscle wall thickness 3 millimeters (mm) or greater and pyloric channel length of 15 mm or greater are considered abnormal in infants younger than 30 days. Gastric contents should not be seen passing through the pylorus because if it does, pyloric stenosis should be excluded and other differential diagnoses such as pylorospasm should be considered. The positions of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein should be noted because altered positions of these two vessels would be suggestive of intestinal malrotation instead of pyloric stenosis.

Although the baby is exposed to radiation, an upper GI series (X-rays taken after the baby drinks a special contrast agent) can be diagnostic by showing the pylorus with elongated, narrow lumen and a dent in the duodenal bulb. This phenomenon caused &quot;string sign&quot; or the &quot;railroad track/double track sign&quot; on X-rays after contrast is given. Plain x-rays of the abdomen sometimes shows a dilated stomach.

Although upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would demonstrate pyloric obstruction, physicians would find it difficult to differentiate accurately between hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pylorospasm.

Blood tests will reveal low blood levels of potassium and chloride in association with an increased blood pH and high blood bicarbonate level due to loss of stomach acid (which contains hydrochloric acid) from persistent vomiting. There will be exchange of extracellular potassium with intracellular hydrogen ions in an attempt to correct the pH imbalance. These findings can be seen with severe vomiting from any cause.

==Treatment==


Infantile pyloric stenosis is typically managed with surgery; very few cases are mild enough to be treated medically.

The danger of pyloric stenosis comes from the dehydration and electrolyte disturbance rather than the underlying problem itself. Therefore, the baby must be initially stabilized by correcting the dehydration and the abnormally high blood pH seen in combination with low chloride levels with IV fluids. This can usually be accomplished in about 24–48 hours.

Intravenous and oral atropine may be used to treat pyloric stenosis. It has a success rate of 85–89% compared to nearly 100% for pyloromyotomy, however it requires prolonged hospitalization, skilled nursing and careful follow up during treatment. It might be an alternative to surgery in children who have contraindications for anesthesia or surgery, or in children whose parents do not want surgery.

===Surgery===
The definitive treatment of pyloric stenosis is with surgical pyloromyotomy known as Ramstedt&#x27;s procedure (dividing the muscle of the pylorus to open up the gastric outlet). This surgery can be done through a single incision (usually 3–4 cm long) or laparoscopically (through several tiny incisions), depending on the surgeon&#x27;s experience and preference.

Today, the laparoscopic technique has largely supplanted the traditional open repairs which involved either a tiny circular incision around the navel or the Ramstedt procedure. Compared to the older open techniques, the complication rate is equivalent, except for a markedly lower risk of wound infection. This is now considered the standard of care at the majority of children&#x27;s hospitals across the US, although some surgeons still perform the open technique. Following repair, the small 3mm incisions are difficult to see.

The vertical incision, pictured and listed above, is no longer usually required, though many incisions have been horizontal in the past years. Once the stomach can empty into the duodenum, feeding can begin again. Some vomiting may be expected during the first days after surgery as the gastrointestinal tract settles. Rarely, the myotomy procedure performed is incomplete and projectile vomiting continues, requiring repeat surgery. Pyloric stenosis generally has no long term side-effects or impact on the child&#x27;s future.

==Epidemiology==
Males are more commonly affected than females, with firstborn males affected about four times as often, and there is a genetic predisposition for the disease. It is commonly associated with people of Scandinavian ancestry, and has multifactorial inheritance patterns. Pyloric stenosis is more common in Caucasians than Hispanics, Blacks, or Asians. The incidence is 2.4 per 1000 live births in Caucasians, 1.8 in Hispanics, 0.7 in Blacks, and 0.6 in Asians. It is also less common amongst children of mixed race parents. Caucasian male babies with blood type B or O are more likely than other types to be affected.

Infants exposed to erythromycin are at increased risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, especially when the drug is taken around two weeks of life and possibly in late pregnancy and through breastmilk in the first two weeks of life.

<doc id="714271" wikidata="Q2714620" url="?curid=714271" title="Helix (band)">
<text>Helix is a Canadian hard rock and heavy metal band. They formed in 1974, and are best known for their 1984 single &quot;Rock You&quot;. The original lineup was formed by drummer Bruce Arnold, and consisted of lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick &quot;Minstrel&quot; Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith &quot;Bert&quot; Zurbrigg. However, their most well known lineup, and the one that recorded &quot;Rock You&quot;, was the 1980s version of the band: Vollmer on vocals, accompanied by guitarists Brent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner and Paul Hackman, bassist Daryl Gray, and drummer Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz. The history of the band has been marked by many lineup changes, with Vollmer being the sole constant member and only remaining member of the original lineup. Although Hackman was killed in a tour bus accident in 1992, the surviving members of the 1980s lineup reunited in 2009 for an album and have continued to tour since 2011. Watson died in 2019. Simmons died in 2021. Hinz died in 2024.

Helix have toured with bands such as Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, Mötley Crüe, Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Heart, Quiet Riot, W.A.S.P., Ian Gillan and Motörhead among others. Their most recent studio album is &quot;Old School&quot; (2019).

== History ==

=== Early years: 1974–1982 ===
Helix were formed in 1974 for a battle of the bands contest in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada by drummer Bruce Arnold. They were originally a six-piece, consisting of Arnold, lead vocalist Brian Vollmer, guitarists Ron Watson and Rick &quot;Minstrel&quot; Trembley, keyboardist Don Simmons, and bassist Keith &quot;Bert&quot; Zurbrigg, who always wore his trademark tuxedo on stage. Their original name was The Helix Field Band, soon shortened to simply Helix. Trembley left after a few months, making the band a five-piece. Soon after, Helix scored some crucial shows as Del Shannon&#x27;s backing band on some Canadian dates. However, the original lineup dissolved by 1976, and three new members entered the fold. Replacing Simmons, Watson and Arnold were guitarists Brent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner and Paul Hackman, who would both remain with Helix through the 1980s, and drummer Brian Doerner, Brent&#x27;s twin brother. Brian Doerner only stayed four years, but returned as a member and a guest several times before joining Saga in 2005.

With new management under Kitchener&#x27;s William Seip, Helix released two independent albums on their own H&amp;S Records, entitled &quot;Breaking Loose&quot; and &quot;White Lace &amp; Black Leather&quot;, in 1979 and 1981 respectively. During the sessions for &quot;Breaking Loose&quot;, Helix recorded a cover of the Del Shannon hit &quot;Thinkin&#x27; It Over&quot;, unreleased until the 1999 Helix CD &quot;B-Sides&quot;. Their second album, &quot;White Lace &amp; Black Leather,&quot; brought more lineup changes with drummer Leo Niebudek taking over for Brian Doerner. Michael J. Fox auditioned to replace bassist Keith Zurbrigg but the job ultimately went to Mike Uzelac. With Zurbrigg gone, Brian Vollmer was now the last remaining original member.

===Commercial success: 1983–1989===
Changing their image from that of a standard bar band to a more image-conscious metal band, Helix finally signed to Capitol Records after being rejected by them three times. In 1983, they released &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot;, with Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz (ex-Starchild) on drums. This album featured Canadian hit video &quot;Heavy Metal Love&quot;, which featured their new look. Under Seip&#x27;s advice, Helix dropped their T-shirts and jeans in favour of leather clothing in order to stay current. The tour for this album cycle was not without drama. Mike Uzelac, whose drug use had become problematic, left the band to be replaced by a bass player named Peter Guy from London, Ontario. Guy was unable to travel to the United States due to a previous drug conviction, and Uzelac came back to finish the tour. When Uzelac had fulfilled his commitment, Mark Rector of Kitchener was hired on bass. He was let go at the conclusion of the tour. With the addition of bassist Daryl Gray completing the band&#x27;s classic 1980s lineup, they released &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; in 1984. It sold over 100,000 copies in Canada, and over 400,000 internationally. The album also included their best known song &quot;Rock You&quot; and a cover of A Foot in Coldwater&#x27;s &quot;(Make Me Do) Anything You Want&quot;.

The band&#x27;s also released a music video for the Crazy Elephant cover &quot;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin&#x27;&quot; the same year, creating a parody of the Miss America Pageant titled the &quot;Miss Rock Fantasy&quot; Pageant. Two versions were created: an uncensored version featuring semi-nude and topless women, and a censored version made available for the more mainstream media markets like MTV. The ending of both versions of the video feature comedian Rip Taylor seated on a motorcycle surrounded by the band and the models all waving goodbye. It caused some controversy several years after its initial release when it was learned that among the cast of porn stars that appear topless in the uncensored version was a then-unknown 16-year-old Traci Lords as &quot;Miss Georgia&quot;. (This version was also featured in a pornographic video titled &quot;Electric Blue 26&quot;.)

In 1985, Helix released their fifth album &quot;Long Way to Heaven&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;Deep Cuts the Knife&quot; and &quot;The Kids Are All Shakin&#x27;&quot;. The album allowed the band to tour Sweden, becoming the first Canadian rock band to do an extensive Swedish tour. The result was a No. 1 album in that country. The following year, their song &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Iron Eagle&quot; and its soundtrack album (this was a completely different song than the track &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; that appeared on their second album).

&quot;Long Way to Heaven&quot; was followed by the release of &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; in 1987, featuring the title track and a cover of &quot;Dream On&quot; by Nazareth. One song from that record, &quot;She&#x27;s Too Tough&quot; was written by Joe Elliot, lead singer for Def Leppard. Leppard also recorded their own version of &quot;She&#x27;s Too Tough&quot; and released it as a B-side and on their album &quot;Retro Active&quot;. The recording of &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;, done in England with producer Mike Stone, was plagued by extensive takes and remixes. Still, the album went gold in Canada, but only managed a disappointing No. 179 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States.

Capitol released the first Helix compilation album &quot;Over 60 minutes with...&quot; at the end of 1989, which featured new and unreleased material as well as the hits. At the end of the decade, Brent Doerner quit the band, tired of the grind of touring. Helix was left as a four piece.

===Lineup changes and tragedy: 1990–2003===
Helix began the 1990s with &quot;Back for Another Taste&quot;, which Doerner contributed songwriting and guitar parts to. On tour, Helix brought in their first American member, Denny Balicky. As a touring member, Balicky was not featured in any of their music videos, but he did make significant appearances in the MuchMusic hourlong special &quot;Walzing With Helix&quot;, which documented Helix&#x27;s European tour with Sacred Reich and Ian Gillan. Balicky later appeared in the retrospective documentary &quot;30 Years of Helix: No Rest for the Wicked&quot; after changing his name to Denny Blake.
After this tour, Vollmer and Hackman began writing songs with the intention of Hackman&#x27;s material being used for the next Helix release, and Vollmer&#x27;s going towards a solo album. In the meantime, &quot;The Early Years&quot; was released by A&amp;M Records, which compiled their first two independent albums on CD for the first time. Helix toured sporadically during this time, including a special reunion show in Kitchener featuring Keith Zurbrigg and the Doerner brothers. A 1992 Western Canadian tour was booked, with Brian Doerner filling in on drums for the unavailable Greg Hinz, and Brent Doerner filling in for Denny Balicki. It was during this tour when disaster struck.

On July 5, 1992, Paul Hackman, not wearing a seatbelt, was killed when the group&#x27;s van rolled down a 40-foot embankment after a concert in Vancouver. Recovering from the shock of his death, Vollmer regrouped with Brent Doerner once again, and also recruited former Brighton Rock guitarist Greg Fraser. Vollmer took the songs he had recorded for his solo album, and released them as the next Helix record, &quot;It&#x27;s a Business Doing Pleasure&quot; (released on Aquarius in 1993, their Capitol contract now finished). He included the song &quot;That Day Is Gonna Come&quot; as a tribute to Hackman, and the video for the song featured unique Super 8 and video footage shot by Vollmer on the road over the years. Brian Doerner played drums on the album. Greg Fraser stated that no then-members of Helix aside from Vollmer himself actually played on the album, since it was in fact a solo album, although they were all pictured and credited in the packaging. However, longtime bassist Daryl Gray did play fretless bass on &quot;Love Is a Crazy Game&quot; and sing background vocals on the rest of the album. Brian Vollmer would later call the album: 

Brent Doerner left the band for the second time after a few shows supporting &quot;It&#x27;s a Business Doing Pleasure&quot;. Helix were forced to carry on with a rapid succession of replacement guitar players: Gary Borden (ex-Ray Lyell), Mark Chichkan (ex-Mindstorm), and Rick Mead (ex-Sire), a rotating cast who played at shows when they were available. By 1996, both Greg Fraser and &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz had departed as well. Brian Vollmer and Daryl Gray carried on with new drummer Glen &quot;Archie&quot; Gamble in 1997, who took on some of their workload such as road managing duties.

In order to keep new Helix product in stores, five new studio tracks were recorded and released in 1998 on &quot;half-ALIVE&quot;, produced by Daryl Gray, which compiled these with live tracks from previous tours. Vollmer also released compilations of hits and rare tracks, as well as his first official solo album (&quot;When Pigs Fly&quot;, 1999) through his website. The band continued to play live through this period, recruiting new guitar players as they were available. At various times, Mike Hall and Gerry Finn, who were both in Killer Dwarfs, joined Helix on the road, as did Darren Smith, the former Harem Scarem drummer, who had switched to guitar. Periodically, the surviving members of the classic 1980s lineup would reform, as they did on the &quot;B-Sides&quot; CD to record three new songs including &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, which were again produced by Daryl Gray. This was a song that Paul Hackman had been working on shortly before his death. At the beginning of the new decade, Helix had to endure another major lineup change. Daryl Gray left the band in 2002 due to an increasingly strained relationship with Vollmer, leaving Brian as the sole member from their 1980s heyday.

With Glen Gamble&#x27;s help, Vollmer added three new members to bring some stability back to the lineup: Jeff &quot;Stan&quot; Fountain replacing Daryl Gray on bass, Dan Fawcett on guitar, and Shaun Sanders on guitar. All three had played together with Gamble in London&#x27;s Buffalo Brothers.

===30th Anniversary===
In 2004, the 30th anniversary of Helix, the band released several titles to mark the occasion. Their first new studio album of all-original material in over a decade came out, titled &quot;Rockin&#x27; in My Outer Space&quot;. Two compilation CDs were also put together, &quot;Never Trust Anyone Over 30&quot; in the US, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; You For 30 Years&quot; in Canada. These albums were marked by a new Helix lineup, and for the first time since 1974, a six-piece: Vollmer, Gamble, Fountain, and new members Jim Lawson (ex-Cherry Smash, guitar), and the husband and wife team of Rainer (guitar) and Cindy Wiechmann (acoustic guitar and vocals). Vollmer first encountered the Wiechmanns in Newfoundland when their band, KAOS, opened for Helix on the &quot;Long Way to Heaven&quot; tour.

The band played a special 30th anniversary concert at Brantford Ontario&#x27;s Sanderson Centre. The show featured the current band and past members. Guests included members of the original 1974 Helix lineup (Ron Watson, Bruce Arnold, Keith &quot;Bert&quot; Zurbrigg, and Don Simmons), as well as Brent Doerner, Brian Doerner, Leo Niebudek, and Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz. The night was released on DVD as the &quot;30th Anniversary Concert&quot;. Released at the same time was the documentary DVD &quot;30 Years of Helix: No Rest for the Wicked&quot;.

Helix experienced a slight resurgence in popularity at this point thanks to a third-season episode of the television series Trailer Park Boys (&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;), in which Bubbles and Ricky discuss the merits of Helix compared to Rush. Vollmer also filmed a cameo during that season which was included as a DVD deleted scene. Helix was mentioned in several other episodes; it&#x27;s revealed that Ricky especially favors attending, and selling marijuana at, their concerts.

In July 2005, Vollmer announced that Helix would be entering the studio to record another new album of original material as well as a cover album. The cover album was intended to be released in spring 2006 and consist entirely of Canadian rock songs. The tentative title was &quot;Many Are Cold But Few Are Frozen&quot;, but it never materialized.
Finally, Brian Vollmer published his autobiography, &quot;Gimme An R&quot;, in December 2005. The book covered the numerous lineup changes and ups and downs of Helix through their 30-year career, along with many rare photos.

===Increased activity: 2005 – July 2009===

In late 2005, Glen Gamble left Helix to form his own band, The Joys. Gamble was briefly replaced by a returning Brian Doerner, who stayed with the band for several months. With Gamble gone, Brian Vollmer was left to manage every aspect of the Helix organization, from booking tours, to distributing Helix merchandise.

More lineup changes ensued in 2006: Brian Doerner again departed, this time to play in Saga. He was replaced by Brent &quot;Ned&quot; Niemi, who was a veteran of the Toronto progressive metal band THD that also featured former Slash Puppet vocalist Mif. Helix toured with this new lineup, most notably opening for Alice Cooper in Canada, before Rainer and Cindy Wiechmann left amicably and formed their own band Nail. Rainer was replaced on guitar by Kitchener&#x27;s Rick VanDyk, formerly of Zero Option who had released an album in the early 1990s. Finally, bassist Jeff Fountain left and was replaced by Paul Fonseca. VanDyk, Fonseca, and Niemi had all played together part-time in a Metallica tribute band called Sandman. With these musicians on board, Helix began augmenting their live setlist with Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Creeping Death&quot; riff to segue between songs. Recording for a new album began.

In October 2006, the song &quot;Heavy Metal Love&quot; was to be featured on the soundtrack for the Trailer Park Boys movie &quot;The Big Dirty&quot;, however, at the last minute, the track was pulled by Dean Cameron, president of EMI Canada, as distribution of the soundtrack was being handled by Universal, and not EMI who owns the track. To make up for this, Helix re-recorded &quot;Heavy Metal Love&quot; and included it on their next release, the 2006 EP &quot;Get Up!&quot;. The original song was still included in the movie even though it did not appear on the soundtrack CD. The &quot;Get Up!&quot; EP itself was hyped by Vollmer as &quot;...very reminiscent of the &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; album.&quot;

In 2007, Helix re-released all the tracks from &quot;Get Up!&quot; along with four new studio tracks on a full-length studio album called &quot;The Power of Rock and Roll&quot;. Unlike the EP, this album received both US and UK releases. In June of that year, Helix played the 2007 Sweden Rock Festival. A new song from &quot;The Power of Rock and Roll&quot; called &quot;Fill Your Head With Rock&quot; was chosen as the theme song of the festival.

Following this, in October 2008 Helix produced their first Christmas CD.
Although Brian Vollmer has recorded Christmas songs before on a charity CD for his church called &quot;Raising The Roof on Mary Immaculate&quot;, &quot;A Heavy Mental Christmas&quot; was the first such release from the band.

By late 2008, Helix began working on a new studio album, their 12th, following up &quot;A Heavy Mental Christmas&quot;. These recording sessions coincided with another new Helix lineup: In February 2009, Brent &quot;The Doctor&quot; Doerner joined the band for the third time. Sean Kelly, singer and lead guitarist of Toronto&#x27;s Crash Kelly, joined as the new bass player. Brent Niemi was replaced on drums by former Sven Gali member Rob MacEachern, who had actually played drums on &quot;Get Up!&quot; and &quot;The Power of Rock and Roll&quot; in Niemi&#x27;s absence. Jim Lawson remained on guitar, VanDyk having departed to make room for the returning Brent Doerner. Work on the new studio CD progressed with Sean Kelly co-writing and co-producing.

In February 2009, Vollmer reunited the surviving members of the &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; lineup (Brent Doerner, Mike Uzelac and Greg Hinz) to record a new version of the AC/DC classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;, to be included on a compilation album. Concurrent to the new Helix lineup and CD, Brent Doerner formed his own band, My Wicked Twin, featuring Brian Doerner, Mike Uzelac, and Shane Schedler (formerly of Kitchener&#x27;s Martyrs of Melody). They released their debut CD in January 2009.

===Current and 80s band reunion: July 2009 – present===
In an unexpected turn of events, after their July 10, 2009 Rocklahoma performance, Sean Kelly amicably gave notice that he was quitting Helix to be the new guitar player in Nelly Furtado&#x27;s band. His first date with Furtado was in Mexico City in September 2009. After Kelly&#x27;s departure, Brian Vollmer reunited the surviving members of the classic 1980s lineup: Daryl Gray, Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz, and Brent Doerner. At their first rehearsal together, Hinz reported, &quot;…it was like we had never left. We all fell right into the groove.&quot; In regards to reuniting the old band, Vollmer cited fatigue of the rotating Helix lineups: 

Daryl Gray was the first member to play live with the band, appearing August 9, 2009, in Lewisporte, Newfoundland. Jim Lawson&#x27;s departure was announced on August 30, 2009. According to Vollmer, &quot;Unfortunately, the long distance between where he lives (Sudbury, Ontario) and where the band operates became a factor in Jim staying with us.&quot; Orangeville&#x27;s Kaleb &quot;Duckman&quot; Duck (of BraVurA), who played on Brent&#x27;s My Wicked Twin CD, was hired on second guitar. Rob MacEachern amicably stepped down for Hinz to return.

The new Helix CD was tentatively titled &quot;It&#x27;s Rock Science, NOT Rocket Science!&quot;, before being changed to &quot;Vagabond Bones&quot; after a song co-written by Kelly. Doerner, Gray and Hinz all appear on the album, along with Sean Kelly, Brent Niemi, Rob MacEachern and Russ &quot;Dwarf&quot; Graham of Moxy and Killer Dwarfs. The songs were described by Vollmer as music &quot;which harkens back to our roots, yet sounds contemporary.&quot; A western Canadian tour was played in October 2009.

Brian Vollmer had a cameo appearance in the second Trailer Park Boys movie &quot;Countdown to Liquor Day&quot;, released September 25, 2009. Helix also performed at the opening gala of the premier of the movie at the Halifax Metro Centre.

The reunion tour has lasted into 2010 including both Canadian and US dates. Brian Vollmer also implied that he would like to continue writing for future Helix albums with former member Sean Kelly. In regards to Kelly&#x27;s departure in 2009, Vollmer stated, &quot;I give Sean my blessings, no worries. As long as we continue to write together, I am happy.&quot;

On August 15, 2010, Vollmer announced the forthcoming release of two new Helix albums. The first, titled &quot;Smash Hits...Unplugged!&quot; contains acoustic re-recorded versions of Helix hits and a cover of the late Canadian singer James Leroy&#x27;s &quot;Touch Of Magic&quot;. The second album is a compilation called &quot;Running Wild in the 21st Century&quot;, containing Helix and Vollmer solo material from 1999 to 2010, including two unreleased tracks (&quot;The William Tell Overture&quot; and a new unnamed original song.) It was originally scheduled to be released in October 2010 but was delayed until 2011, due to problems getting permission to include the AC/DC cover &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top&quot;. It will be replaced by a new original song instead, causing the delay.

In November 2010, Vollmer announced that the band were filming a pilot episode for a Helix-based reality television series.

In 2012, Helix toured across eight cities in southwestern/southeastern Ontario for a mini Heavy Mental Christmas Tour. Performing classic Christmas songs but with a twist of heavy metal, and they played their hit songs such as &quot;Rock You&quot;, &quot;Heavy Metal Love&quot; and their own song &quot;All I Want for Christmas... Is the Leafs to Win the Cup&quot;.

Currently, the band is playing in bars/casinos across Canada, and they are working on a new album, which is due for release in 2023.

Drummer Greg &quot;Fritz&quot; Hinz died of cancer on February 16, 2024, at the age of 68.

<text>Jesse James Boulerice (born August 10, 1978) is an American former professional ice hockey forward. Primarily playing in an enforcing role, Boulerice played the majority of his National Hockey League (NHL) career for the Carolina Hurricanes.

== Background ==
Boulerice was born in Rouses Point, New York, located in the northeasternmost corner of the state, on the Canadian border. In addition to working on his family&#x27;s farm, young Boulerice loved playing hockey, leading to his father building a rink in their backyard. He played in the World Juniors with Team USA, winning a silver medal in 1997. As a junior, he also spent three years playing with Detroit and Plymouth of the Ontario Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Boulerice was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, 133rd overall. He has played for the Carolina Hurricanes, St. Louis Blues and Flyers. He was charged with assault in 1998 while playing with the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) after a violent stick-swinging incident with Guelph Storm forward Andrew Long.

Boulerice is known for being the victim of an Aaron Downey left hook on February 11, 2003, after failing to land the first punch, which left Boulerice with a broken jaw and a concussion. Boulerice spent the night in the hospital as his Carolina Hurricanes lost in overtime to the Dallas Stars, 2–1.

Boulerice&#x27;s role as an enforcer was reduced later in his career due to the NHL&#x27;s stricter penalties for instigating a fight, by a $10,000 fine to the coach if it occurs in the final five minutes of a game.

On October 10, 2007, Boulerice delivered a cross-check to the face of Vancouver Canucks forward Ryan Kesler, with his team up 7–2 in the third period. Boulerice received a 25-game suspension as disciplinary action from the league, which is tied for the fourth-longest suspension for an on-ice incident in modern NHL history.

Boulerice started the 2008–09 season with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). On November 11, 2008, he signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche and while being reassigned to the Monsters, was claimed off waivers by the Edmonton Oilers. After playing only two games with the Oilers, Boulerice was placed on waivers again, and was re-claimed by the Avalanche on November 21, 2008.

Boulerice was invited to the AHL&#x27;s Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins training camp for the 2009–10 season. He made his presence felt and remained to sign a one-year contract with the Penguins on October 3, 2009. In 54 games with Wilkes-Barre, Boulerice tied his AHL career high with four goals and led the team with 124 penalty minutes. On July 29, 2010, he re-signed with the Penguins to another one-year deal. On January 7, 2011, Boulerice was suspended for 10 games for deliberately running over an AHL referee.

== Personal life ==
After retiring from professional hockey in 2011, Boulerice became a financial advisor with Merrill-Lynch&#x27;s office in Raleigh, NC. He is also a part-time coach for the Junior Hurricanes of North Carolina. He lives in Raleigh with his wife Cailin and three children. He coaches youth hockey and serves on the board of the Raleigh Youth Hockey Association.

<doc id="714277" wikidata="Q686115" url="?curid=714277" title="Lydian mode">
<text>The modern Lydian mode is a seven-tone musical scale formed from a rising pattern of pitches comprising three whole tones, a semitone, two more whole tones, and a final semitone.

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\key c \lydian
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4^\markup { Modern C Lydian scale } d e fis g a b c2
&lt;/score&gt;
Because of the importance of the major scale in modern music, the Lydian mode is often described as the scale that begins on the fourth scale degree of the major scale, or alternatively, as the major scale with the fourth scale degree raised half a step. This sequence of pitches roughly describes the scale underlying the fifth of the eight Gregorian (church) modes, known as Mode V or the authentic mode on F, theoretically using B but in practice more commonly featuring B. The use of the B as opposed to B would have made such piece in the modern-day F major scale.

== Ancient Greek Lydian ==
The name Lydian refers to the ancient kingdom of Lydia in Anatolia. In Greek music theory, there was a Lydian scale or &quot;octave species&quot; extending from &quot;parhypate hypaton&quot; to &quot;trite diezeugmenon&quot;, equivalent in the diatonic genus to the modern Ionian mode (the major scale).

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\key e \major
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (diatonic genus) on E } fis gis a b cis dis e2
&lt;/score&gt;
In the chromatic and enharmonic genera, the Lydian scale was equivalent to C D E F G A B C, and C C E F F A B C, respectively, where signifies raising the pitch by approximately a quarter tone.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\key e \major
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (chromatic genus) on E } f gis a bes cis dis e2
&lt;/score&gt;

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\key e \major
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 e4^\markup { Greek Lydian tonos (enharmonic genus) on E } feh gisih a aih cisih disih e2
&lt;/score&gt;

==Medieval Lydian mode==
In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, this mode was described in two ways. The first way is the diatonic octave species from F up to F an octave above, divided at C to produce two segments:

: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 5/4
 f4^\markup { Medieval Lydian mode on F } g a b c
 \time 4/4
 \parenthesize c d e f
&lt;/score&gt;
The second is as a mode with a final on F and an ambitus extending to F an octave higher and in which the note C was regarded as having an important melodic function. Many theorists of the period observed that B is used more typically than B in compositions in Lydian mode.

==Modern Lydian mode==
The Lydian scale can be described as a major scale with the fourth scale degree raised a semitone, making it an augmented fourth above the tonic; e.g., an F-major scale with a B rather than B. That is, the Lydian mode has the following formula:

:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

This mode&#x27;s augmented fourth and the Locrian mode&#x27;s diminished fifth are the only modes to have a tritone above the tonic. 
: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 f4^\markup { Modern F Lydian scale } g a b c d e f2
&lt;/score&gt;
In Lydian mode, the tonic, dominant, and supertonic triads are all major. The subdominant is diminished. The triads built on the remaining three scale degrees are minor.

Alternatively, it can be written as the pattern

: whole, whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half or (W-W-W-H-W-W-H)

==Notable compositions in the Lydian mode==

===Classical (Ancient Greek)===
The &quot;Paean and Prosodion to the God&quot;, familiarly known as the Second Delphic Hymn, composed in 128 BC by Athénaios Athenaíou is predominantly in the Lydian &quot;tonos&quot;, both diatonic and chromatic, with sections also in Hypolydian.

===Medieval===
The 12th-century &quot;Hymn to St. Magnus&quot; from the Orkney Islands, referencing Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, is in Gregorian mode or church mode V (F white notes), extending from the E below to the octave above, with B&#x27;s throughout, in two-part harmony of mostly parallel thirds. The Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and Ite, missa est of Guillaume de Machaut&#x27;s &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; feature extensive use of F and B, as well as F and B.

===Romantic===
A rare, extended use of the Lydian mode in the Classical repertoire is Simon Sechter&#x27;s 1822 &quot;Messe in der lydischen Tonart&quot; (Mass in the Lydian Mode). A more famous example from around the same time is the third movement of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132 (1825), titled by the composer &quot;Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart&quot; (&quot;Holy Song of Thanksgiving by a Convalescent to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode&quot;). The alternating passages in F use the Lydian scale with sharp fourth scale degree exclusively.

Charles-Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Allegro barbaro&quot; (Étude Op. 35, No. 5, published in 1848) is written strictly in F Lydian, with no B&#x27;s present at all.

Anton Bruckner employed the sharpened fourth of the Lydian scale in his motet &quot;Os justi&quot; (1879) more strictly than Renaissance composers ever did when writing in this mode.

Gabriel Faure&#x27;s song Lydia from &quot;2 Melodies&quot; Op 4 ?1872. This ode to Lydia - by Parnassian poet Leconte de Lisle - starts, appropriately, in the Lydian mode and, in F, has a raised 4th (B natural) in the first line of the melody. 

===Modern===
In the 20th century, composers began once again to exploit modal scales with some frequency. George Enescu, for example, includes Lydian-mode passages in the second and third movements of his 1906 Decet for Winds, Op. 14. An example from the middle of the century is the scherzo movement of Carlos Chávez&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 (1951–54). The movement opens with a fugue subject, featuring extremely wide leaps, in C Lydian with following entries in F and G Lydian. Alexei Stanchinsky wrote a Prelude in Lydian mode earlier in the 20th century.

===Jazz===
In &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot;, George Russell developed a theory that became highly influential in the jazz world, inspiring the works of people such as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and Woody Shaw.

<text>The Longfellow Mountains are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains System, located within the North Maine Woods region of northwestern Maine. They extend across the state from northern New Hampshire northeastward to the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec.

In 1959, the Maine Legislature voted to give the various mountains and ranges in northwest Maine. The collective name of the Longfellow Mountains, in honor of the Maine-born poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882).

This and most of Maine&#x27;s mountain ranges and mountain peaks are part of the Appalachian Mountains System.

<doc id="714282" wikidata="Q1720413" url="?curid=714282" title="Keel (band)">
<text>Keel is an American hard rock/heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1984. They are best known for their rock anthem &quot;The Right to Rock&quot;. The band was active until 1989, with a brief reunion in 1998. Keel reunited again in 2008 and toured in 2009 for their 25th anniversary. Although the band is still active to this day, they have not released any new material since 2010.

== History ==
Keel was formed by former Steeler vocalist Ron Keel. The original members were Ron Keel on vocals, former Icon / Schoolboys member David Michael Phillips on guitar, Marc Ferrari on lead &amp; rhythm guitars, Bobby Marks on drums and Kenny Chaisson on bass guitar. Within months, Phillips left to join King Kobra and was replaced by ex-Cheetah guitarist Bryan Jay. This was the lineup for their 1984 debut album &quot;Lay Down the Law&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release, Marks left and was replaced by Steven Riley, who subsequently left early in the recording of the band&#x27;s second album to join W.A.S.P., and was in turn replaced by Dwain Miller, forming a lineup which would remain stable for almost four years. Their debut album caught the eye of KISS&#x27; Gene Simmons, resulting in his production of their second album, &quot;The Right To Rock&quot;, released in January 1985. Their next and also Simmons-produced third album &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; was released on April 30, 1986. It included the single &quot;Because the Night&quot;, a song that was co-written by Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen and had been a hit for Smith in 1978.

In 1986, Keel won the Best Band of the Year award in the second annual &quot;Metal Edge&quot; magazine reader&#x27;s poll, beating such noted bands as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.

In 1987, the song &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Outlaw&quot; (a cover from the 1978 self titled debut of Australian hard rock band Rose Tattoo) appeared on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Dudes&quot;. Their fourth album, &quot;Keel&quot;, was released on June 21, 1987, recorded with producer Michael Wagener. An unreleased track from the album, Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Proud To Be Loud&quot;, would eventually wind up on Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Power Metal&quot; album, which Ferrari produced early in 1988.

Ferrari and Jay both left in 1988, after touring in support of the &quot;Keel&quot; album. They were replaced by keyboardist Scott Warren, later in Dio, and Baton Rouge guitarist Tony Palmucci.

Their fifth album, &quot;Larger Than Live&quot;, was released in 1989 with six new studio recordings, including a cover of the 1980 Humble Pie song &quot;Fool for a Pretty Face&quot;. Also on the album were six live tracks recorded in March 1989. Following the shooting of the music video for the song &quot;Dreams Are Not Enough&quot; on that same year, Ron Keel announced the disbandment of Keel.

=== Post-disbandment and first reunion ===
In the 1990s, Ferrari wrote a gear column for &quot;Metal Edge&quot; magazine entitled &quot;Power Sources&quot;, and went on to form Cold Sweat with among others ex-UFO guitarist Erik Gamans, who would release the album &quot;Break Out&quot; in 1990. After the demise of that group, Ferrari appeared in both &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; movies (as the guitarist for Tia Carrere&#x27;s band &quot;Crucial Taunt&quot;) and formed the band Medicine Wheel, which released three CDs. In addition, he released two solo CDs and started a music publishing company called MasterSource, employing Ron Keel to write material for the library. Ferrari also recently wrote a book titled &quot;Rock Star 101&quot;.

Bryan Jay and Dwain Miller went from Keel to forming a band called Dogbone, with ex-Riot vocalist Rhett Forrester, bassist Rob Thiessen and vocalist Eddie Saiz.

Kenny Chaisson teamed up with former Hawk and Masi vocalist, David Fefolt, guitarist Jim McMellen, and drummer Timothy Yasui under the name Forty Thieves. The group recorded a pair of demos in 1990 and 1991, the latter featuring former Surgical Steel drummer, Bob Milan, before disbanding. Chaisson also had a brief stint with Warrior.

In 1998, members of Keel got together to release their sixth album &quot;Keel VI: Back in Action&quot;. It mainly consisted of unreleased material from their previous albums, including the aforementioned &quot;Proud To Be Loud&quot;.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Speed Demon&quot; (from &quot;The Right to Rock&quot;) is briefly heard on the 2002 movie &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, and appears on Mike Varney&#x27;s &quot;U.S. Metal Vol. IV&quot; compilation.

Ron Keel pursued multiple musical projects before forming the country metal band IronHorse in 2001. In 2006, Ron left IronHorse and formed K2 Featuring Ron Keel a year later.

=== Second reunion ===
In November 2008, Keel reunited in time to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. All the members from &quot;The Right to Rock&quot; era had rejoined except for Chaisson. The new bassist is Ron Keel&#x27;s longtime friend, Geno Arce. Their first reunion show was held in Hollywood on January 24, 2009. In addition, the band played at the third annual Rocklahoma festival in July 2009.

A reunion album, &quot;Streets of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; was released in 2010, as well as a 25th anniversary edition of &quot;The Right to Rock&quot; featuring a brand new re-recorded version of the title song as a bonus track.

Keel continued to perform live sporadically throughout the 2010s; however, according to Ron Keel, the band has no plans to follow-up on &quot;Streets of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

<doc id="714283" wikidata="Q1351161" url="?curid=714283" title="Eric Boulton">
<text>Eric Boulton (born August 17, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger. Boulton was drafted 234th overall in the ninth round of the 1994 draft by the New York Rangers. While he never played for the Rangers, he played for the Buffalo Sabres, Atlanta Thrashers, New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders between 2000 and 2016. Boulton was best known for his role as an enforcer.

==Playing career==
Boulton was drafted in the ninth round, 234th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1994 Entry Draft of the National Hockey League (NHL). Despite being drafted by the Rangers, he would eventually make his NHL debut playing for the Buffalo Sabres, where he played for four seasons. During the 2004 NHL Lockout, he played for the Columbia Inferno of the ECHL. After the Lockout ended, Boulton began playing with the Atlanta Thrashers.

In October 2005, Boulton was suspended for six games after elbowing Tampa Bay Lightning rookie Paul Ranger, causing a hairline fracture of the jaw and a concussion. The incident occurred at the end of a 6–0 rout of the Thrashers on October 20, 2005. NHL vice-president Colin Campbell said, &quot;It is clear Mr. Boulton&#x27;s actions were careless and caused injury. There is no circumstance that can justify this type of action.&quot; Only a week earlier, Boulton had made a similar move in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, almost injuring Eric Lindros.

Boulton was re-signed by the Thrashers in 2008 to a two-year deal. He recorded his first career hat trick on December 18, 2010, against the New Jersey Devils. He then signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Devils for a 2-year contract worth $575,000 in the first year and $750,000 in the second, joining former Thrashers teammates Ilya Kovalchuk and Johan Hedberg. After a dismal season in which the Devils did not record a single goal for with Boulton on the ice, Boulton was bought out of the final year of his contract on June 30, 2012. The next day, Boulton proceeded to sign a one-year deal with the New York Islanders. He re-signed with the Islanders for the next three consecutive seasons as well, all on one-year deals. Boulton is the Thrashers&#x27; all-time leader in penalty minutes with 639 penalty minutes.

After the 2016–17 season, Boulton ended his professional career, however continued his association with the Islanders in accepting a scouting role.

<doc id="714286" wikidata="Q159818" url="?curid=714286" title="Travnik">
<text>Travnik () is a town and a municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the administrative center of the Central Bosnia Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, west of Sarajevo. the town had a population of 15,344 inhabitants, while the municipality had 53,482 inhabitants.

Historically, it was the capital city of the governors of Bosnia from 1699 to 1850, and has a cultural heritage dating from that period.

== Geography ==

Travnik is located near the geographic center of Bosnia and Herzegovina at . The river Lašva passes through the town, flowing from west to east before joining the Bosna. Travnik itself is built in the large Lašva valley, which connects the Bosna river valley in the east with the Vrbas river valley in the west.

Travnik is found above sea level. Its most distinguishing geographic feature are its mountains, Vilenica and Vlašić. Vlašić, named after the Vlachs, is one of the tallest mountains in the country at .

A large karst spring, the Plava Voda wellspring, rises under Vlašić mountain, just below Travnik Castle, in the very center of the Old Town of Travnik.

===Climate===
Travnik has a continental climate, located between the Adriatic sea to the South and Pannonia to the North. Average July temperature is . Average January temperature on the other hand is . It snows in Travnik every year.

==History==
Although there is evidence of some settlement in the region dating back to the Bronze Age, the true history of Travnik begins during the first few centuries AD. Dating from this time there are numerous indications of Roman settlement in the region, including graves, forts, the remains of various other structures, early Christian basilicas, etc. In the town itself, Roman coins and plaques have been found. Some writing found indicates the settlement is closely connected to the known Roman colony in modern-day Zenica, away.

In the Middle Ages the Travnik area was known as the&quot; župa Lašva, a&quot; province of the medieval Bosnian Kingdom. The area is first mentioned by Bela IV of Hungary in 1244. Travnik itself was one of a number of fortified towns in the region, with its fortress &quot;Kaštel&quot; becoming today&#x27;s old town sector. The town itself is first mentioned by the Ottomans during their conquest of nearby Jajce.

After the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in the 15th century, much of the local population converted to Islam as part of the Islamization policy by the Ottoman Empire. The town quickly grew into one of the more important settlements in the region, as the authorities constructed mosques, marketplaces, and various infrastructures. During 1699 when Sarajevo was set afire by the soldiers of Field-Marshal Prince Eugene of Savoy, Travnik became the capital of the Ottoman province of Bosnia and residence of the Bosnian viziers. The town became an important center of government in the entire western frontier of the empire, and consulates were established by the governments of France and Austria-Hungary.

The period of Austrian occupation brought westernization and industry to Travnik, but also a reduction of importance. While cities such as Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zenica grew rapidly, Travnik changed so little that during 1991 it had a mere 30,000 or so people, with 70,000 in the entire municipality.

A large fire started by a spark from a locomotive in September 1903 destroyed most of the town&#x27;s buildings and homes, leaving only some hamlets and the fortress untouched. The cleanup and rebuilding took several years.

From 1922 to 1929, Travnik was the capital of the Travnik Oblast. From 1929 to 1941, Travnik was part of the Drina Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

During the Bosnian War, the town mostly escaped damage from conflict with Serbian forces, hosting refugees from nearby Jajce, but the area experienced fighting between local Bosniak and Croat factions before the Washington Agreement was signed in 1994. After the war, Travnik was made the capital of the Central Bosnia Canton.
== Administration ==
Travnik is the administrative centre of the Municipality of Travnik, whose area of jurisdiction covers the town of Travnik itself and 89 other rural settlements. Travnik is also the capital of the Central Bosnia Canton, one of the ten Cantons of Bosnia. The municipal government has various agencies dedicated to the operations of the region, ranging from the bureau of urbanization and construction, to the bureau of refugees and displaced persons.

==Economy==
The economy of the Travnik region suffered greatly during the war period of the early 1990s. In 1981 Travnik&#x27;s GDP per capita was 63% of the Yugoslav average. Nowadays, most of the region deals with typical rural work such as farming and herding. As for the urban industry, Travnik has several factories producing everything from matches to furniture. Food processing is also a strong industry in the region, especially meat and milk companies.

==Tourism==

Like many Bosnian towns, Travnik&#x27;s tourism is based largely on its history and geography. Nearby Mount Vlašić is one of the tallest peaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and an excellent spot for skiing, hiking and sledding. Whilst tourism is not very strong for the town, Mount Vlašić is probably its chief tourist attraction. Numerous structures dating to the Ottoman era have survived in near perfect condition, such as numerous mosques, oriental homes, two clock towers (&quot;sahat kula&quot;; Travnik is the only town in Bosnia and Herzegovina to have two clock towers) and fountains. The old town dates back to the early 15th century, making it one of the most popular and widely accessible sites from that time.

==Culture==
Travnik has a strong culture, mostly dating back to its time as the center of the local government in the Ottoman Empire. Travnik has a popular old town district, which dates back to the period of Bosnian independence during the first half of the 15th century. Numerous mosques and churches exist in the region, as do tombs of important historical figures and excellent examples of Ottoman architecture. The town museum, built in 1950, is one of the most impressive cultural institutions in the region.

One of the main works of Ivo Andrić, a native of Travnik, is the &quot;Bosnian Chronicle&quot; (or the &quot;Travnik Chronicle&quot;), depicting life in Travnik during the Napoleonic Wars and written during World War II.

The Bosnian Tornjak, one of Bosnia&#x27;s two major dog breeds and a national symbol, originated in the area, and can be found around the Vlašić mountain.

<text>Susan Michelle Ward (born April 15, 1976) is a former American actress and model. She made her film debut in the 1997 sequel, &quot;Poison Ivy: The New Seduction&quot;, before appearing in films, including, &quot;The In Crowd&quot; (2000), &quot;Going Greek&quot; (2001), &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001) and &quot;Wild Things 2&quot; (2004). She is perhaps best known for her roles as Meg Cummings in the entire run of soap opera, &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; (1997–1999), and as Chloe Kmetko in the series, &quot;Make It or Break It&quot; (2009–2011).

==Early years==
Ward was born and raised in Monroe, Louisiana. She is the daughter of detective Eddie Ward and Emily Sue Ward, a nurse and associate professor. Ward began modeling at age 13, leaving school and moving to New York City to do so. She attended Northeast Louisiana University for one year before pursuing her acting career.

==Career==
Ward made her acting debut appearing in the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1995. The following year, she was a regular cast member on the short-lived NBC teen drama &quot;Malibu Shores&quot;, produced by Aaron Spelling. She made guest appearances on &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; and had secondary role in the erotic thriller film &quot;Poison Ivy: The New Seduction&quot;.

In late 1996, Ward was cast as virginal Meg Cummings on the Aaron Spelling&#x27;s NBC soap opera &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, which aired from 1997 to 1999. In 1999, she turned to films, and starred as the psychotic Brittany Foster in the 2000 teen thriller &quot;The In Crowd&quot;. The movie was a commercial disappointment in theaters, but found some success on cable and home video. The following year, Ward played a supporting role in the Farrelly Brothers movie &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;. She has also acted in numerous other direct-to-DVD movies, and has made guest appearances in various TV shows, most notably &quot;Friends&quot;.

In 2009, she landed the role Chloe Kmetko, mother of a young gymnast, on the ABC Family drama series &quot;Make It or Break It&quot;. She was part of the main cast during the show&#x27;s first two seasons.

==Personal life==
On June 4, 2005, Ward married David C. Robinson, the vice president of Morgan Creek Productions, the movie studio that produced &quot;The In Crowd&quot;. They met when he cast her as the film lead in 1999. Dr. Wayne Keltner, a friend of the bride, performed the ceremony. She no longer acts and raises her son with Robinson in North Carolina.

<text>Santo Tirso () is a city and municipality located in the north of Porto Metropolitan Area, 25 km from central Porto, Portugal. In the region, the Ave Valley, there is a large center of textile industry. The population in 2021 was 67,709, in an area of .

Another important center in the municipality is Aves.

The Santo Tirso Monastery built in 978 is a point of interest.

==History==

The History of Santo Tirso is tied to its benedictine monastery. The town grew around it and, from 978 until 1834, it was a &quot;couto&quot; – a neutral area that belonged to the clergy. Known initially as Santo Tirso de Riba de Ave, this city has been the capital of a municipality at least since 1833. Its composition changed throughout the years, especially in 1998, when the nearby city of Trofa created its own municipality, taking some of Santo Tirso&#x27;s towns with it.

Towards the middle of the 19th century, Santo Tirso spearheaded the industrialization of the Ave Valley. One of the first textile factories in the region, the Fábrica de Fiação e Tecidos do Rio Vizela, opened in Vila das Aves, part of its municipality, in 1845. This factory would become the largest of its kind in Portugal, with an area of about nine square kilometres and employing, at one point, over 3.000 people.

==Geography==
The highest point in the municipality is in the Alto de S. Jorge, in the parish of Refojos, with 527 meters of altitude. The municipality&#x27;s current perimeter is .

===Climate===
Santo Tirso has a Mediterranean climate with warm to hot summers and mild, very wet winters.

<text>Josef Sami Boumedienne (born 12 January 1978) is a Swedish hockey coach/scout and former professional hockey defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New Jersey Devils, Tampa Bay Lightning and Washington Capitals. He is currently the Assistant General Manager for the Sweden men&#x27;s national ice hockey team.

==Playing career==
Boumedienne started his career playing for Huddinge IK in the Swedish Allsvenskan in the season 1995–96. He was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft as their third-round pick, #91 overall. Boumedienne moved to play for Södertälje SK in the Elitserien. After two seasons with Södertälje SK he went to play with Tappara in the Finnish SM-liiga.

Boumedienne played two seasons with Tappara and in the 1999–00 season he led the team&#x27;s defenders with 8 goals and 24 assists for 32 points. In the 2000–01 season he moved to the NHL, playing his first season on New Jersey&#x27;s farm team, the Albany River Rats in the AHL. The next season he made his NHL debut on 6 October 2001 and played one game with New Jersey Devils, scoring his first NHL goal. In November 2001 the Devils traded Boumedienne along with Sascha Goc and Anton Butin to the Tampa Bay Lightning, in exchange for Andrei Zyuzin.

Boumedienne played three games with the Lightning, playing mainly with the Lightning&#x27;s farm team, the Springfield Falcons. In 2002 Tampa Bay traded Boumedienne to the Ottawa Senators for a seventh-round draft pick. He played with the Senators organization until December 2002, when the Senators traded him to the Washington Capitals for Dean Melanson. He started his Capitals career playing mainly on the Capitals&#x27; farm team Portland Pirates, playing six games with the Capitals. In the 2003–04 season he continued with the Capitals, playing 37 games with the team. After a successful season he received a one-year contract extension from the Capitals.

In the NHL lockout season of 2004–05, Boumedienne started his season with Brynäs IF in Sweden&#x27;s Elitserien. Only 13 games later, he moved to the SM-liiga when SML-team Kärpät acquired him. He won the Finnish championship with the team. In the 2005–06 season he started with the Zürich Lions in the Swiss NLA, but was released by the team after 17 games, where he scored 1 goal and 10 assists. According to the Zürich Lions, Boumedienne&#x27;s defending was poor, leading to his release. He played the rest of the season with Södertälje SK, in the Elitserien.

Boumedienne signed a two-year contract with Kärpät in November 2006. He missed the start of the season due to abdominal surgery. In April 2007 Boumedienne won his second Finnish championship with Kärpät.

In the 2008–09 season he moved to the Toronto Maple Leafs organization, playing 19 games with the Toronto Marlies. After this he returned to SM-liiga, winning his third SM-medal, gaining a silver with Kärpät.

For the 2009–10 season Boumedienne started with Dynamo Minsk in the KHL. However, he was released by Minsk, even though he led all Minsk defenders in points, with 7 points in 17 games.

In 2010 Boumedienne moved to play with EV Zug in the NLA. After the season Djurgårdens IF acquired Boumedienne on a one-year contract, with an option for 2011–12. On 30 January 2012, Finnish club Jokerit acquired Boumedienne and signed him to a contract for the rest of the season.

Boumedienne&#x27;s last season of his professional career was in 2012–13, initially with HC Bratislava Slovan of the Kontinental Hockey League, finishing with Oulun Kärpät in the SM-liiga.

==Scouting and coaching career==
Boumedienne was hired as a scout by the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2013, and was then promoted to Director of European Scouting in 2016. He served as a scout for Lukko, and a late-season head coaching position with Brynäs in 2021 to keep them from being relegated. He was promoted to Director of Pro Scouting with Columbus in 2021. 

In 2022, it was announced that Boumedienne was hired as the assistant general manager for the Swedish men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. In this position, he served as the general manager for Team Sweden during the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.

In October 2023, Boumedienne was hired as an assistant coach for the Columbus Blue Jackets in the aftermath of Pascal Vincent&#x27;s promotion to head coach. Before he was hired, he was serving as a head coach for the Ohio AAA Blue Jackets&#x27; 14U team.

<text>Clayface is an alias used by several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Most incarnations of the character possess clay-like bodies and shapeshifting abilities, and all of them are adversaries of the superhero Batman. In 2009, Clayface was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 73rd-greatest comic book villain of all time.

A prominent enemy of Batman, Clayface has appeared in various forms of non-comics media, and has been voiced by Ron Perlman in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) and Alan Tudyk in both &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; and the DC Universe (DCU) animated series &quot;Creature Commandos&quot;, among others, with live-action versions of the character appearing on the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, portrayed by Brian McManamon, and &quot;Pennyworth&quot;, portrayed by Lorraine Burroughs. The character will headline a self-titled film (2026) written by Mike Flanagan, also set in the DCU.

==History==
Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the original Clayface, Basil Karlo, appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #40 (June 1940) as a B-list actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain that he had portrayed in a horror film. Kane stated that the character was partially inspired by the 1925 Lon Chaney version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; and that his name was derived from Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone. The character only appeared twice in the Golden Age, but was the inspiration for the shape-shifting Silver Age version.

In the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of science fiction-inspired foes, including Matthew Hagen, a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive protoplasm, who became the second Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of comic book history.

In the late 1970s, Preston Payne became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism, Preston Payne used the second Clayface&#x27;s blood to create a cure for his condition, but instead became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his new condition on to others to survive.

Sondra Fuller of Strike Force Kobra used the terrorist group&#x27;s technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as Lady Clay. She formed the Mud Pack with the original and third Clayfaces. During this era, the original Clayface used the DNA of Payne and Fuller to become the Ultimate Clayface (as he now called himself).

Sometime after the Mud Pack event, Payne and Fuller had a son named Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne, who, as the fifth Clayface, also had metahuman shapeshifting powers.

In a 1998 storyline, Dr. Peter Malley later uses a sample of Cassius Payne&#x27;s skin to become Clay-Thing.

The Todd Russell version of Clayface was introduced in &quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 3) #4 (May 2002), and the Johnny Williams version of Clayface was introduced in &quot;&quot; #60 (February 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
===Basil Karlo===
====Golden Age====
The first Clayface, Basil Karlo, first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #40 (June 1940). He is a B-list actor who is driven insane when he hears that a remake of the classic horror film he had starred in, &quot;Dread Castle&quot;, would be shot without him acting in the film, even though he is to be one of the advising staff. In response, he dons the costume of Clayface, a villain he once portrayed, and becomes a serial killer.

====Silver Age====
Earth-One&#x27;s Basil Karlo has a similar history to his Golden Age counterpart. However, he is a less major villain and is later killed by John Carlinger during an attack on his yacht.

====Post-Crisis====
In post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Karlo gains shapeshifting abilities similar to his successors after injecting himself with Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller&#x27;s blood. He is seemingly killed on two occasions after sinking into the earth, with the first giving him quartz-like crystals across his body.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Clayface joins Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains. In later appearances, he joins the Injustice League and temporarily assumes Donna Troy&#x27;s form after absorbing her powers.

====The New 52====
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Basil Karlo gains his powers from a chemical formula that renders his body malleable. However, his DNA becomes unstable, rendering him unable to return to his original form.

====DC Rebirth====
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Basil Karlo&#x27;s origin is similar to the DC Animated Universe&#x27;s incarnation of Matt Hagen / Clayface. He is an actor who is disfigured in a car accident, uses the chemical Re-Nu to restore his face, and transforms into a clay-like metahuman after overdosing on it.

Victoria October works to return Karlo to normal, during which Batman has him wear a special wristband that locks him in his human form.

Karlo later fakes his death, allowing him and October to leave Gotham City.

===Matt Hagen===

The second version of Clayface, Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; Hagen, first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #298. He is a treasure hunter who gains shapeshifting abilities from a radioactive pool of protoplasm.

In &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Hagen is killed by the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s Shadow Demons.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Hagen resurfaces and joins Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, Hagen appears as an escaped inmate of Arkham Asylum.

===Preston Payne===
The third version of Clayface, Preston Payne, first appeared at the end of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #477 before making his first full appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #478–479. He is a S.T.A.R. Labs employee who suffers from hyperpituitarism and transforms into Clayface after using Matt Hagen&#x27;s blood to cure his condition. However, his body is unstable, forcing him to periodically kill others to survive.

In the &quot;Mud Pack&quot; storyline, Payne falls in love with Sondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface. They later have a son, Cassius.

A stunted, emaciated Payne appears in the graphic novel &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot; by Grant Morrison and Dave McKean.

In &quot;Justice League: Cry for Justice&quot;, Payne is killed by Prometheus. He later resurfaces in &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;.

===Sondra Fuller===
The fourth version of Clayface, Sondra Fuller (also known as Lady Clay), first appeared in &quot;Outsiders&quot; #21. She is a member of Strike Force Kobra who gains powers from her employer Kobra&#x27;s technology. She later falls in love with Preston Payne, and they have a son named Cassius.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Sondra claims that she and other metahumans were created by the government.

===Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne===
After the Mud Pack incident, Payne and Fuller escape and fall in love while on the run. They eventually have a child together named Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne, who becomes the fifth version of Clayface and debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #550. Following his birth, Cassius is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory.

Cassius possesses the unique ability to separate parts of his body, which can bond with others and give them his abilities.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Cassius joins Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

===Peter &quot;Clay-Thing&quot; Malley===
The sixth version of Clayface, known as the Clay-Thing, also debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #550. Clay-Thing is created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with D.E.O. scientist Peter Malley. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Clay-Thing is destroyed when Cameron Chase turns his own powers against him, and his remains are stored at the D.E.O. Headquarters.

===&quot;Todd Russell&quot;===
The seventh version of Clayface debuted in &quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 3) #1 (January 2002), but is not actually shown until &quot;Catwoman&quot; (vol. 3) #3 (March 2002). This character does not remember his true identity, but it is said that he resembles actor Todd Russell. Struggling with his memory loss, he used aliases such as Brian, Greg, and Todd. Having the power to change into virtually any shape and size, he preys upon prostitutes in Gotham&#x27;s East End until Catwoman is able to contain his severed head inside of a freezer. There are very few background details given about this character&#x27;s past. He was in the Army, suffered injuries, and was subsequently experimented on (possibly by the DEO) before losing most of his memory and discovering his new powers. After his capture, he is held captive and further experimented upon for almost two years at S.T.A.R. Labs in Gotham before being freed by Catwoman.

===Johnny Williams===

The eighth version of Clayface, Johnny Williams, debuted in &quot;Batman: Gotham Knights&quot; #60 (February 2005). Williams is a former firefighter who is transformed into a clay-based creature after an explosion in a chemical plant. He first discovers his transformation after he accidentally kills a prostitute; horrified and stricken with guilt, he plans to commit suicide.

Before he can do so, he is approached by Hush and the Riddler, who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, promising a cure if he does their bidding. This includes pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush&#x27;s true identity) and Jason Todd to hurt Bruce Wayne.

Elliot also takes some samples from Williams to try and determine how he can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of Clayface without losing his original form, also using these samples to infect Batman&#x27;s ally Alfred Pennyworth with a virus that allows Hush to exert some degree of control over Alfred, forcing him to commit murder. Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated and Hush will never help him after Hush tries to steal a sample of Cassius.

Knowing that he is going to die, Williams offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself by providing Batman with a sample of himself so that Batman can find a cure for the virus infecting Alfred.

==Powers and abilities==
Each of the Clayfaces have different powers, but they all share the ability to shapeshift.

* In his earliest appearances, Basil Karlo had no superpowers, but wore a clay mask. In later comics, his body is made out of mud upon taking the cell samples from Clayface III and IV, thus enabling him to gain their powers combined. In &quot;The New 52&quot;, these are improved to a level, in which he can mimic the DNA of others.
* Matt Hagen has temporary shapeshifting, voice mimicry, and a malleable clay-like body, which allows him to manipulate his physical features at will. He must reimmerse himself in a pool of protoplasm that gave him his powers to recharge them every 48 hours or else he would regress back into his human form. Later, Hagan duplicated the protoplasm by scientific means, but only for five hours before needing to be renewed.
* Preston Payne originally had an amorphous physiology, yet ended up gaining the ability to melt people with his touch. He has immense strength from his anti-melting exoskeleton. Preston&#x27;s metamorphic abilities were later restored by Prometheus.
* Sondra Fuller has powers identical to Clayface II, except these superpowers are permanent.
* Cassius &quot;Clay&quot; Payne possesses the combined powers of both his parents. If a piece of him is separated from his mass, it can develop its own consciousness and even &quot;bond&quot; with human hosts to transform them into &quot;Clay-Things&quot;. Hush has noted that Cassius is essentially the only &quot;pure&quot; Clayface as the only one who was never human to begin with, all other Clayfaces retaining some aspect of their human DNA that prevents others simply taking samples to imitate their transformations.
* Peter Malley gained similar abilities like Clayface V, but is capable of dissolving people via eye contact.
* Both &quot;Todd Russell&quot; and Johnny Williams have shape-changing capabilities.

==Other characters named Clayface==
===John Carlinger===
John Carlinger was a renowned actor and director who held a film exhibition aboard the yacht Varania III. Basil Karlo, the original Clayface, assaulted Carlinger with murderous intent because Carlinger neglected to &quot;invite&quot; him to the event, but Carlinger killed Karlo instead. Feeling threatened by a few actors attending the exhibition who were rumored to be demanding an audit of his production company&#x27;s finances, Carlinger used Karlo&#x27;s alter ego to mask his true identity and intentions when he gunned these actors down in cold blood. Batman deduced &quot;Clayface&#x27;s&quot; true identity by the water-solubility of his makeup, revealing it to be a type of makeup used by modern actors instead of the greasepaint Karlo was more likely to use. Batman punched Carlinger&#x27;s lights out and exposed his murder scheme, putting the corrupt movie producer&#x27;s brief stint as Clayface to an abrupt end.

===The Clayface of Japan===
The ninth version of Clayface, the Clayface of Japan, debuted in &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; #6 (June 2011) as part of &quot;The New 52&quot;. Batman tasks Batman Japan (Jiro Osamu) to fight the Clayface of Japan about months into his Batman Incorporated venture. Not much is known about this Clayface, except that he resembles all of the previous Clayfaces and seems to have their same set of powers. Presumably, this Clayface, as a rival to Osamu, is a native of Japan. Batman states that this Clayface is a newcomer, a samurai, and operates in or around Hokkaido.

===Clayface clones===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, a villain named Jeffrey Bode makes several short-lived clones of Clayface.

===Clownface===
The being known as Clownface began as a stray piece of Clayface&#x27;s body that became unattached and gained enough sentience to morph itself into a mute old man. This man was found and taken to Arkham Manor because of his unresponsiveness. Later, the Joker infected this portion of Clayface with Joker venom, morphing it into a separate entity dubbed Clownface.

==Alternative versions==

=====DC Animated Universe=====
The Matt Hagen incarnation of Clayface, with elements of Basil Karlo, appears in series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU), voiced by Ron Perlman.
* First appearing in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Feat of Clay&quot;, this version is an actor who was previously disfigured in an accident. Corrupt businessman Roland Daggett gives him Renuyu, a beauty cream that restores his face and enables him to change it to that of another person&#x27;s, but its effects prove temporary and addictive. Daggett hires Hagen to aid him in his criminal activities in exchange for more Renuyu, but Hagen eventually refuses to cooperate, leading to Daggett&#x27;s men force-feeding him a large quantity of Renuyu that transforms him into Clayface. Following a failed attempt on Daggett&#x27;s life and being defeated by Batman, Hagen goes into hiding. In the episode &quot;Mudslide&quot;, Hagen steals an isotope from Wayne Biomedical Labs to stabilize himself when his body begins to deteriorate before seeing Stella Bates, a former medical adviser on one of his films who fell in love with him. Hagen is nearly restored, but Batman finds them and aborts the treatment. In the ensuing fight, Clayface falls off a cliff and into the ocean, where he dissolves and is presumed dead.
* Hagen returns in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;. Following a minor appearance in the pilot episode &quot;Holiday Knights&quot;, the episode &quot;Growing Pains&quot; reveals that after falling into the ocean, his remains drifted near a pipe leaking chemicals into the ocean, restoring some of his strength. While recovering, he sent a portion of himself disguised as a little girl named Annie (voiced by Francesca Marie Smith) away to see if it was safe for him to resurface, but she develops her own personality and encounters Robin, who falls in love with her. Hagen eventually poses as Annie&#x27;s abusive father while committing robberies to make a living before recovering and cornering Robin and Annie, with the latter allowing herself to be reabsorbed to save him. An enraged Robin nearly kills Hagen, but Batman intervenes and Hagen is subsequently arrested and imprisoned in Arkham Asylum.
* Hagen appears in the &quot;Justice League&quot; two-part episode &quot;Secret Society&quot;. Sometime prior to the series, Morgan Edge captured Hagen until Gorilla Grodd&#x27;s Secret Society free him and add him into their ranks. Having grown less aggressive and psychopathic, he is initially reluctant to join them until Grodd promises to help Hagen restore his human form while maintaining his shapeshifting powers.

===Film===
==== Live-action ====
* An unidentified Clayface appears in the script for the unproduced &quot;&quot;.
* In January 2021, filmmaker Mike Flanagan expressed interest in making a standalone &quot;horror/thriller/tragedy&quot; film centered on Clayface. He had previously discussed a &quot;horror-leaning&quot; iteration of the character, among other properties, for the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in a general meeting with DC Films producer Jon Berg. However, Flanagan felt the meeting &quot;kind of went nowhere&quot;, saying that DC did not &quot;bite on&quot; his idea but that he was ready to commit to the project &quot;anytime&quot;. By October 2022, filmmaker Matt Reeves met with directors and writers for several films and series spin-offs from his standalone DC film &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022) that were in early development and centered on members of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery, such as Clayface. In March 2023, Flanagan and his Intrepid Pictures partner Trevor Macy met with James Gunn and Peter Safran, the co-CEOs of DC Studios, regarding a Clayface film, in which he would not be the villain that he typically is portrayed as in the comics. If the film were to move forward, it was unclear at the time if it would be part of the DC Universe (DCU) or under the &quot;DC Elseworlds&quot; label. Moreover, Reeves&#x27;s &quot;The Batman&quot; sequel (2027) was also expected to feature the character. Flanagan said the report of him pitching a Clayface film by then was &quot;entirely speculative&quot;, further stating in late May that such a film was not in development and that he was participating in the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began earlier that month. In December 2024, DC Studios greenlit the &quot;Clayface&quot; film for the DCU with a script written by Flanagan and a release date of September 11, 2026. Reeves was confirmed to be producing alongside Lynn Harris of his company 6th &amp; Idaho Productions. Filming was expected to begin in early 2025, but Flanagan was unable to direct due to his commitments to his &quot;The Exorcist&quot; film (2026) and a &quot;Carrie&quot; television series. In February 2025, James Watkins was hired to direct the film, which was described as a &quot;Hollywood horror story&quot; about the original Clayface, a B-movie actor who uses a substance to remain relevant but becomes made entirely of clay. The film was intended to be produced on an approximate budget of $40 million.

As the Crimson Cloak, Clayface steals isotopes to recreate Professor Milo&#x27;s teleportation device, which both Scarlett and the Riddler worked on, while also framing Batman and Mystery Inc. for the crimes to keep them distracted.

<text>Daniel Denis Boyle (born July 12, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). Undrafted, Boyle played in the NHL for the Florida Panthers; Tampa Bay Lightning, with which he won the Stanley Cup in 2004; San Jose Sharks; and New York Rangers.

==Collegiate career==
Boyle played junior hockey for the Gloucester Rangers of the Canadian Junior Hockey League and signed to play US college hockey for Miami University of the CCHA. Boyle established himself quickly, making the first-team All-Rookie team in 1994–95, the All-CCHA First Team in 1996–97 and 1997–98, and being named a first-team All-American in both 1997 and 1998. He was Miami&#x27;s record holder for goals in a game by a defenseman (3) and points in a season by a defenseman (54). During his career, he ranked second at Miami in career assists (107), ninth in career points (147) and third in assists in a season (43 in 1997). In 1996–97, Boyle helped Miami to a 27–12–1 (.688) mark and the program&#x27;s second ever appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Boyle was named to the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Professional career==

===Florida Panthers===
Undrafted in any NHL Entry Draft after four years of college hockey at Miami University, the under-sized defender was signed as a free agent by the Florida Panthers on March 30, 1998. He played his first two seasons in the Panthers&#x27; farm system in the American Hockey League (AHL), earning All-Rookie Team honours in 1999, as well as Second Team All-Star honours in 1999 and 2000. Boyle earned a full-time roster spot with the Panthers in 2000–01, recording four goals and 22 points.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
The next season, his fourth in Florida, Boyle was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a 2003 fifth-round draft pick (Martin Tůma) on January 7, 2002. After completing the season with 20 points in 41 games after coming over from the Panthers, he was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Lightning on August 6, 2002.

Boyle recorded 13 goals and 53 points in his first full season with the Lightning in 2002–03 before helping the team to the 2004 Stanley Cup championship. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Boyle went overseas to play for Djurgårdens IF of the Swedish Elitserien. As NHL play resumed the next season, Boyle continued to produce with a 15-goal, 53-point season in 2005–06. He recorded his first career NHL hat-trick against the New York Rangers on December 23, 2006, adding an assist for a four-point game in a 4–3 win. The following season, Boyle elevated his game to career-high numbers of 20 goals, 43 assists and 63 points, good enough for Second team All-Star honours.

Boyle suffered a major setback, however, in September 2007, injuring himself in a freak accident after a pre-season game when a skate slipped off a hook in his locker and hit him in the left wrist, severing three tendons. Boyle underwent initial wrist surgery on September 23; he attempted to return on October 29, but after playing his first four games of the 2007–08 season, Boyle underwent additional surgery on the injured wrist, missing another 36 games. He did not make a full comeback until January 24, 2008, scoring two goals in his return, and soon thereafter was re-signed to a six-year, $40 million contract extension on February 25. He completed his injury-shortened campaign with 25 points in 37 games.

===San Jose Sharks===
Despite coming off a recent contract extension with the Lightning, on July 4, 2008, Boyle was traded, along with Brad Lukowich, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Matt Carle, Ty Wishart, a first-round draft pick in 2009 and a fourth-round draft pick in 2010. Boyle was pressured to waive his no-trade clause by Tampa Bay&#x27;s new ownership, who said they would otherwise place him on waivers, where he would likely be claimed by the Atlanta Thrashers. Already knowing Joe Thornton, Patrick Marleau and Evgeni Nabokov, Boyle agreed to be traded to the Sharks.

In his first season with the Sharks, Boyle tallied 16 goals and 57 points over 77 games, leading all team defencemen. The following season, on December 31, 2009, Boyle scored his 100th career NHL goal against the Phoenix Coyotes in a 3–2 shootout win. He finished the campaign with 15 goals and 58 points. In the opening series of the 2010 playoffs, Boyle ended game three against the Colorado Avalanche in overtime by inadvertently shooting the puck into his own net. Pressured by Avalanche forward Ryan O&#x27;Reilly, Boyle attempted to ring the puck around the boards behind his net, but it was deflected by O&#x27;Reilly into the Sharks&#x27; net between Evgeni Nabokov&#x27;s pad and the post. Nonetheless, the Sharks won the series 4–2, winning Games 4, 5 and 6; Boyle had a point in all three games.

In the first period of the October 15, 2013, against the St. Louis Blues, Boyle was checked from behind by Maxim Lapierre into the boards, injuring his jaw and knocking him unconscious; the incident led to a fight involving teammate Matt Pelech and 17 minutes worth of penalties for Andrew Desjardins. Boyle was taken off the ice via stretcher to a local hospital, and would miss the following game against the Dallas Stars. He returned on November 2, in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes, scoring a goal in a shootout loss. After the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, Sharks general manager Doug Wilson announced that pending free agent Boyle would not be returning to San Jose for the 2014–15 season. On June 5, the Sharks traded his rights to the New York Islanders for a conditional 2015 fifth-round pick.

===New York Rangers===
Unable to come to terms with the Islanders, Boyle opted to head to free agency, and on July 1, 2014, he signed a two-year contract with the New York Rangers.

On October 5, 2016, Boyle announced his retirement from the NHL. Boyle scored 164 goals and 605 points over 1,093 NHL games with four teams. In his retirement statement Boyle said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been fortunate and blessed to have had the opportunity to do what I most love to do. All I wanted to do as a young boy was have the opportunity to play ONE game in the NHL. Over a thousand games later, this whole experience seems surreal. I want to thank all four organizations for the opportunity, my teammates and the FANS for this amazing run that I will cherish forever.&quot; Boyle stated that he will live in the San Jose area with his family.

==International play==



Boyle made his international debut with Canada at the 2005 World Championships in Austria during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. He contributed three assists in nine games as part of a silver medal-winning effort by Canada; they were defeated 3–0 in the gold medal game by the Czech Republic. The next year, Boyle was named as a reserve in light of injuries to Scott Niedermayer and Ed Jovanovski for Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He did not appear in a game, however, as Team Canada was kept off the podium.

On December 30, 2009, team Canada general manager Steve Yzerman named Boyle to the 2010 Winter Olympic team as a full member. On February 28, 2010, the team defeated the United States to win Canada&#x27;s eighth gold medal in Olympic men&#x27;s hockey.

==Personal life==
Boyle has two daughters. and is in a relationship with Collette D’Amico.

Growing up, Boyle attended French-speaking École élémentaire Sainte-Anne and École secondaire publique De La Salle in Ottawa.

During Game 1 of the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals with the Tampa Bay Lightning against the Calgary Flames, an electrical fire broke out in his Florida home, causing an estimated $300,000 worth of damage.

<doc id="714311" wikidata="Q38336" url="?curid=714311" title="Dandie Dinmont Terrier">
<text>A Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small Scottish dog breed in the terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a distinctive topknot of hair on the head. They are friendly but tough, and are suitable for interaction with older children. There are breed-specific health concerns: they can be affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body, and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.

The breed is named after a fictional character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel, &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;. This character, Dandie Dinmont, is thought to be partly based on James Davidson, who is credited as the originator of the modern breed. Davidson&#x27;s dogs descended from earlier terrier-owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.

There are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations per year.

== History ==

The breed originates from the dogs being used in the Anglo-Scottish border country. During the 1600s, they were used for hunting badgers and otters. Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown, dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins. 

These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier, although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers. The head of this family was Willie &quot;Piper&quot; Allan, who was born in nearby Bellingham. He kept dogs for the hunting of otters. Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in Eslington Park. Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan&#x27;s dogs after he successfully removed the otters, which Allan refused. 

Allan died on 18 February 1779, and his dogs passed into the care of his son James. James&#x27;s son eventually inherited the dogs and sold a dog named Old Pepper to Mr Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border. Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan&#x27;s dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth&#x27;s manor.

The breed remained relatively unknown outside of the Borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Guy Mannering&quot; was published. Scott spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirk learned of the prowess of these types of specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson&#x27;s dogs came from a variety of sources including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.

Some interbreeding with other breeds took place in the mid-1800s, which may have introduced Dachshund blood into the breed, although certain breeders maintained pure-bred lines. The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of &quot;Stonehenge&quot; in the 1880s, and was denied by many breeders of that era. By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott&#x27;s writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement in the development of the Bedlington Terrier.

The Kennel Club formed in 1873 and, at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk, Scottish Borders on 17 November 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed, becoming the third oldest breed club for dogs in the world. Lord Melgund was the society&#x27;s first president, while E Bradshaw Smith was the first vice president. Breeders Hugh Dalziel and William Stachen were also involved in the formation of the club. The breed standard was created by William Wardlaw Reid, another founding member of the club, with it was agreed to a year later at another meeting of the club. A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877. Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle, where with the exception of during the Second World War, the shows continued to be held until 1982. Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire.

The DDTC is not the only breed club in the UK. For a while several breed clubs were created in Scotland, but none lasted particularly long except for the Scottish Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society which merged into the DDTC in 1929. Today, in addition to the DDTC, there are also the Southern Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society, and for Scotland, the Caledonian Dandie Dinmont Club.

The breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels led the way to re–establishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

In 2006, the Kennel Club recognised the Dandie Dinmont Terrier as one of the rarest dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work after 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the previous ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures.

== Description ==

The breed has short legs, with an elongated body. Unusually among Scottish terrier breeds, it has pendulous ears. The neck is muscular, having developed from the breed&#x27;s use against larger game. The typical height at the withers is , and they can weigh anywhere between . 

While the Dandie generally is a hardy breed, it may have issue climbing stairs. They have a silky coat which forms a topknot on top of the dog&#x27;s head. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier has a similar body shape to the Skye Terrier, but the Skye&#x27;s coat is thicker and longer.

The coat comes in two colour ranges, pepper and mustard. Pepper ranges from dark blueish black to very light silvery gray; mustard can vary from reddish brown to fawn, with the head appearing to be almost white. Typically, the legs and feet are of a darker colour with the lighter colour on the body slowly blending into that on the legs. The depth of the coat can reach up to . The colour of the coat is usually set by the time the dog reaches eight months of age, but the Dandie Dinmont Terrier will continue to mature physically until around two years old.

== Temperament ==
The breed is tough but usually friendly and is suitable for older children. It makes both a good companion and a guard dog but is among the most docile of the terrier breeds; they are usually quite undemanding of their owners. However they are known for their ability to dig large holes in a short space of time. They can be trained to be good with cats but should not be trusted around smaller animals such as hamsters or rats. They are described as being &quot;very game&quot;, in that they are prone to challenging other animals, including foxes, and in some cases other dogs.

== Health ==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Due to the breed&#x27;s elongated body, there can be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog&#x27;s back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on what part of the dog&#x27;s back is affected; they can include weakness, paralysis, and/or loss of bladder control.

An American study found a higher risk for extra-hepatic congenital portosystemic shunts, with 1.6% of Dandie Dinmont Terriers having the condition compared to 0.18% overall and 0.05% for mixed-breed dogs. 

The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is also at a slightly higher risk of cancer than average.

<doc id="714315" wikidata="Q969874" url="?curid=714315" title="Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke">
<text>Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, KG, KB (19 January 1601) was an English peer and politician. He was the nephew of Katherine Parr and brother-in-law of Lady Jane Grey through his first wife. During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, he held administrative positions in Wales. Politically, he was associated with Robert Dudley.

==Life==

He was the son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and Anne Parr. His aunt was Queen Consort Katherine Parr, last wife of King Henry VIII. His uncle was William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, who was an influential man during the reigns of Edward VI and Elizabeth I. Herbert was responsible for the costly restoration of Cardiff Castle. Pembroke, like other members of his family, was a man of culture. He was a special patron of antiquaries and heralds and collected heraldic manuscripts.

Herbert was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, under Archbishop John Whitgift. He is also said to have studied at Douay. In 1554, while his father was entertaining the entourage of Philip II of Spain&#x27;s men at Wilton House, Herbert&#x27;s discreet manners caught the attention of the Marquis de las Navas and he was made a gentleman of the chamber to King Philip upon his arrival in England. In 1557, he took part in a tournament held before Queen Mary, and accompanied his father to the siege of St Quentin.

On his father&#x27;s death in 1570, he succeeded to the Earldom of Pembroke and on 4 April 1570 was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire. In right of his mother, Anne Parr, he succeeded as Lord Parr and Ros of Kendal, Lord FitzHugh, Lord Marmion, and Lord Quentin on 1 August 1571.

==Court life==
In the court intrigues of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Pembroke was regarded as a partisan of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and was certainly in very intimate relations with him. He took a prominent part in the trials of the 4th Duke of Norfolk; Mary, Queen of Scots in October 1586; and Norfolk&#x27;s son Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, in 1589.

In 1586, he succeeded his father-in-law, Sir Henry Sidney, as Lord President of Wales, a position he held until his death, and became at about the same time Vice-Admiral of South Wales. From thenceforth, he spent much time at Ludlow Castle, the official residence of the president of Wales where he actively discharged the duties of his office.

During the 1590s, Herbert was patron of Pembroke&#x27;s Men, a theatre company who were the first group to perform a number of plays including &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson.

In 1595, Pembroke was described as &#x27;very pursife and maladise&#x27; and by September 1599, &#x27;his life was despaired of&#x27;. Herbert died at Wilton House leaving his lady &#x27;as bare as he could and bestowing all on the young lord even to her jewels&#x27;. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.

==Marriages and issue==
He was married to Lady Katherine Grey, sister of Lady Jane Grey, on 25 May 1553, in a political match arranged by their parents in the hopes of assisting the Duke of Northumberland with his plan to secure the succession of Jane who on the same day alongside her sister married the Duke&#x27;s younger son, Lord Guildford Dudley. The union was never consummated, and in 1554, Queen Mary&#x27;s influence led to the consent of Herbert&#x27;s father&#x27;s dissolution of the marriage.

His second wife was Lady Katherine Talbot, whom he married in 1563, in a double wedding with their siblings Francis, Lord Talbot and Lady Anne Herbert. Katherine and Francis were children of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife Lady Gertrude Manners, daughter of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland. Queen Elizabeth was extremely fond of Lady Katherine and when Katherine developed a fatal illness she often visited her at Baynard&#x27;s Castle. She died in 1575 leaving no children by Herbert.

By April 1577, Herbert married his third wife, the Mary Sidney, daughter of Sir Henry Sidney and Lady Mary Dudley, daughter of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, thus a younger sister of Guilford Dudley. Their children included William and Philip (who both were Earl of Pembroke after their father), Katherine (who died as a small child), and Lady Anne Herbert, who died young.

==Legacy==
The armour of Henry Herbert is now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in the Arms and Armor galleries. It was made in 1580 at the Greenwich armoury, a royal workshop founded by Henry VIII to produce armour for the English nobility, chiefly Henry, without having to commission it from overseas. His portrait, and that of his father William, are on display at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff, adjacent to Cardiff Castle which the family owned and occupied for much of the 16th century.

<text>Mark Stephen Schweiker (English pronunciation:  ; born January 31, 1953) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 44th governor of Pennsylvania from October 5, 2001, to January 21, 2003. Schweiker, a Republican, assumed the governorship in 2001, when his predecessor, Tom Ridge, resigned to become Homeland Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. Schweiker serves as the SVP and Chief Relationship Officer of Renmatix.

==Early life==
Mark Schweiker, second son of John and Mary Schweiker, was born in Levittown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He is of German and Irish descent. He attended Bishop Egan High School in Bucks County and earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. He holds a master&#x27;s degree in administration from Rider University. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Rider University in 2004. After college he entered the business world and held positions at Sadlier Oxford and McGraw Hill. Later, he formed his own management consulting firm.

==Political career==
===Bucks County politics===
Schweiker entered politics in 1979 when he successfully ran for supervisor of Middletown Township. In 1987, he was elected Bucks County Commissioner. Schweiker and fellow Republican Andrew Warren overturned a Democratic majority on the board, largely on the strength of opposition to a water project planned for Point Pleasant.

===Lieutenant governor===
In 1994, Schweiker successfully ran for the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor. Schweiker ran in the fall general election alongside Congressman Tom Ridge, the gubernatorial nominee. The Ridge/Schweiker ticket won the election, beating the Democratic ticket of incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel (the gubernatorial nominee), and State Labor and Industry Secretary Tom Foley (the nominee for Lieutenant Governor) by a margin of 45.40% to 39.89%. Constitution Party candidate Peg Luksik captured 12.8 percent of the vote. The Ridge–Schweiker ticket easily won re-election in 1998.

As lieutenant governor, Schweiker chaired the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Council, The Board of Pardons, The Governor&#x27;s Council on Recycling Development and Waste Reduction, oversaw the State-wide Radio Network, and was involved with Pennsylvania&#x27;s anti-terrorism task force and the &quot;Weed and Seed&quot; anti-crime initiative.

In a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named &quot;Missing in Action&quot;.

===Governor===

Schweiker had decided against a run for the governor&#x27;s office in 2002 and was preparing to finish out his term when the September 11 terrorist attack occurred. Ridge resigned as governor on October 5, 2001, to join the Bush administration as Homeland Security Advisor. 

Schweiker began preparing for the transition as acting governor on September 20, and was formally sworn in as Pennsylvania&#x27;s 44th governor on the day of Ridge&#x27;s resignation. By provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Robert Jubelirer, the President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, became lieutenant governor. This became a matter of controversy as Jubelirer retained his leadership position and seat in the State Senate.

In the wake of the terrorist attacks, Schweiker moved to secure Pennsylvania&#x27;s five nuclear reactors, created the Governor&#x27;s Task Force on Security by executive order, and expanded the ranks of the Pennsylvania State Police. Schweiker also faced budget shortfalls due to the economic collapse following the attacks and a crisis in the School District of Philadelphia.

Schweiker negotiated the state takeover of the school district and also was the first governor of Pennsylvania to put state funds into pre-school activities. He also passed tort reform measures, replacing Ridge, a former trial lawyer who was less inclined to push those measures.

Schweiker oversaw the Quecreek Mine rescue in Somerset County, in July 2002, a 77-hour operation that saved the lives of all nine trapped coal miners from the Quecreek mine. Following the rescue, Schweiker implemented a series of new safety procedures to provide better protection for miners.

Schweiker held to his decision not to stand for the 2002 governor&#x27;s race despite several polls that showed him with a comfortable lead in a hypothetical match-up with eventual Democratic nominee Ed Rendell. However, he did send out a news release as a joke on April Fools&#x27; Day announcing his intention to run. Rendell won the election and was sworn in as Schweiker&#x27;s successor on January 21, 2003.

Schweiker was named to the PoliticsPA list of &quot;Sy Snyder&#x27;s Power 50&quot; list of influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2003.

===After governorship===

Schweiker left office when his term expired on January 21, 2003. He became president and CEO of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in February 2003 and served until 2009 when he announced his resignation to join Philadelphia-area pharmaceutical manufacturer PRWT as president of business process outsourcing. Schweiker is also a consultant to the law firm of Stradley Ronon.
His commitment to the Pennsylvania business community led him to his current position as the Chief Relationship Officer and SVP of the King of Prussia-based technology company Renmatix. Working closely with the company&#x27;s technical team and board of directors, Schweiker has been instrumental in driving key initiatives with public and private sector stakeholders across several business areas including site selection for production facilities, financial partnerships, feedstock procurement, commercial programs, and public affairs. He plays a critical cross-functional role in accelerating corporate development in the United States and abroad.

Schweiker has been a vocal advocate of the United States&#x27; opportunity to take a leadership role in building a bioeconomy, while revitalizing rural economies. A trusted voice in the industry, Schweiker is a frequent speaker, addressing opportunities the bio-economy and green manufacturing can have in developing robust, economies centred around agricultural communities. His career has earned him many honours and awards, including Life Sciences Public Official of the Year, Speaker of the Year for Communications Excellence and Technology Advocate of the Year for Technology Innovation. Schweiker has also presented to Congress a number of times and appeared as a guest on CNN, FOX Business, PBS&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. He has spoken at: the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, the Atlantic&#x27;s Town Hall Gathering and AgBiomass Canada.

In a 2016 article in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Schweiker brought attention to the Indian government&#x27;s renewed focus on bioethanol as a sustainable energy source for the country. He explained that &quot;As the country emerges as a pivotal actor in international energy discussions, India&#x27;s bio-energy strategy will provide a blueprint for other countries with plentiful agricultural waste to leverage and spur economic growth.&quot;

In January 2016, Schweiker endorsed state representative Scott Petri for the 8th District of Pennsylvania for Congress.

Schweiker, is listed as the executive-in-residence of Rider University’s homeland security program.

<text>Mack Gordon (born Morris Gittler; June 21, 1904 – February 28, 1959) was an American lyricist for the stage and film. He was nominated for the best original song Oscar nine times in 11 years, including five consecutive years between 1940 and 1944, and won the award once, for &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;. That song, along with &quot;The More I See You&quot;, has proved among his most enduring, and remains popular in films and television commercials to this day. &quot;At Last&quot; is another of his best-known songs.

==Biography==
Of Jewish heritage, Gordon was born in Grodno (modern-day western Belarus), then part of the Russian Empire. He emigrated with his mother and older brother to New York City in May 1907; the ship they sailed on was the S/S &quot;Bremen&quot;; their destination was to his father in Guttenberg, New Jersey. Gordon appeared in vaudeville as an actor and singer in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but his songwriting talents were always paramount.

He formed a partnership with English pianist Harry Revel that lasted throughout the 1930s. In the 1940s he worked with a string of other composers including Harry Warren. Gordon was active in the Hollywood chapter of ASCAP and according to fellow songwriter Frank Loesser, frequently the most passionate and voluble at their meetings.

The Internet Movie Database gives credit to Gordon for songs used in the soundtrack of over 100 films, with Gordon writing specifically for at least 50 of them. His catalogue includes more than 120 songs sung by some of the world&#x27;s most famous and talented performers such as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Etta James, Glenn Miller, Barbra Streisand, Mel Tormé, Christina Aguilera and many more. His close friendship with many of his artists (such as Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack) and his ability to write lyrics that were timeless, allowed him to become one of the most famous members of the world of music and a legendary lyricist. His exhibit in the Songwriters Hall of Fame says he was &quot;arguably one of the most successful lyricists to write for the screen&quot;.

Gordon died in 1959. He is entombed in the Corridor of Immortality at Home of Peace Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<text>The Wolf Prize in Physics is awarded once a year by the Wolf Foundation in Israel. It is one of the six Wolf Prizes established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in Agriculture, Chemistry, Mathematics, Medicine and Arts.

The Wolf Prizes in physics and chemistry are often considered the second most prestigious awards in those fields, after the Nobel Prize. The prize in physics has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize – from the 26 prizes awarded between 1978 and 2010, fourteen winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, five of those in the following year.

<text>The South Midlands is an area of England which includes Northamptonshire, the northern parts of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire and the western part of Bedfordshire. Unlike the East Midlands or West Midlands, the South Midlands is not one of the NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom.

==An early definition==
The 1851 census defined a South Midland division which comprised Middlesex (except the Metropolitan portion), Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire.

To understand why the South Midland division extends so far south, it may help to know that some 19th-century geographers defined a Central Plain consisting of the middle parts of England, lying between the valleys of the River Trent and the River Thames to the north and south, and between the Fen district and the high ground bordering the valley of the River Severn to the east and west.

==Milton Keynes and South Midlands growth area==
In 2008, the Government referred to an area centred on the City of Milton Keynes as the Milton Keynes and South Midlands growth area. This area comprises the whole of Bedfordshire, the whole of Northamptonshire, and parts of Buckinghamshire (the City of Milton Keynes and other parts of north Buckinghamshire). It straddles the boundaries of other regions of England, including portions of the East Midlands, East of England and South East England.

The main settlements are Aylesbury, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough, Rushden, Bedford and Luton. A report in 2002 found that: &quot;The most successful economies are those of Milton Keynes and Northampton. Bedford, Corby and the Luton/Dunstable/Houghton Regis area are in need of regeneration.&quot; The region is served by London Luton Airport (the fifth busiest airport in the United Kingdom), and has important road and rail links, being served by the M1 motorway and both the West Coast and East Coast main lines, connecting it with London, Birmingham and the north of England.

<doc id="714325" wikidata="Q1634392" url="?curid=714325" title="Penguin Cafe Orchestra">
<text>The Penguin Cafe Orchestra (PCO) were an avant-pop band led by English guitarist Simon Jeffes. Co-founded with cellist Helen Liebmann, the band toured extensively during the 1980s and 1990s. The band&#x27;s sound is not easily categorized, having elements of exuberant folk music and a minimalist aesthetic occasionally reminiscent of composers such as Philip Glass.

The group recorded and performed for 24 years until Jeffes died of an inoperable brain tumour in 1997. Several members of the original group reunited for three concerts in 2007. Since then, five original members have continued to play concerts of PCO&#x27;s music, initially as the Anteaters, then as the Orchestra That Fell to Earth. In 2009, Jeffes&#x27; son Arthur founded a successor band simply called Penguin Cafe. Although it includes no original PCO members, the band features many PCO pieces in its live repertoire, and records and performs new music written by Arthur.

==History==
After becoming disillusioned with the rigid structures of classical music and the limitations of rock, in which he also dabbled, Simon Jeffes became interested in the relative freedom in folk music and decided to imbue his work with the same immediacy and spirit.

Describing how the idea of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra came to him, Jeffes said:

The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Music from the Penguin Cafe&quot;, recorded from 1974 to 1976, was released in 1976 on Brian Eno&#x27;s experimental Obscure Records label, an offshoot of the EG label. It was followed in 1981 by &quot;Penguin Cafe Orchestra&quot;, after which the band settled into a more regular release schedule.

The band gave its first major concert on 10 October 1976, supporting Kraftwerk at The Roundhouse. They went on to tour the world and play at a variety of music festivals as well as residencies on the South Bank in London. From 1976 to 1996 they played in the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and throughout Europe and the UK. In March 1987, they were the subject of an episode of the ITV arts series &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, where they performed &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;Bean Fields&quot;, &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;Giles Farnaby&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Evolution==

Simon Jeffes experimented with various configurations live and in the studio, including an occasional &#x27;dance orchestra&#x27; and a quintet of strings, oboe, trombone and himself on piano. On the studio albums, he sometimes played several instruments, and brought in other musicians according to the needs of each piece.

There were a number of incarnations of the live band. Original members Gavyn Wright and Steve Nye left in 1984 and 1988 respectively. Bob Loveday replaced Gavyn Wright on violin. Gradually a regular lineup evolved around:

* Jeffes and Helen Liebmann
* Neil Rennie (ukulele), who joined in 1975
* Geoffrey Richardson (viola, cuatro, guitar, clarinet, mandolin, ukulele), who had joined in 1976 and co-wrote three pieces on &quot;Broadcasting from Home&quot; (1984)
* Julio Segovia (percussion), who answered an advert in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and joined in 1978 on percussion
* Paul Street (guitar, cuatro, ukulele), who joined in 1984 and left in 1988
* Jennifer Maidman (percussion, bass, ukulele, cuatro), who joined in 1984
* Steve Fletcher (piano, keyboards) who replaced Steve Nye in 1988
* Annie Whitehead (trombone), who had appeared on &quot;Broadcasting from Home&quot; (1984) and joined the live band in 1988
* Peter McGowan (violin), succeeding Bob Loveday
* Barbara Bolte (oboe)

Doug Beveridge also became a regular fixture at the live mixing desk. The album &quot;Concert Program&quot; (1995) is the definitive recording of this lineup, and includes many of the group&#x27;s best-known pieces.

==Later bands==

After Simon Jeffes&#x27; death in 1997, the band&#x27;s members continued to meet occasionally, but there were no new recordings or public appearances for over ten years. The band briefly reformed in 2007, with the lineup as featured on &quot;Concert Program&quot; (minus Julio Segovia), with Jennifer Maidman now handling Simon&#x27;s guitar parts. The original members, joined onstage by Simon Jeffes&#x27;s son Arthur on percussion and additional keyboards, played three sold-out shows at the Union Chapel in London.

After those concerts, Arthur Jeffes wanted to form a new group without any of the original PCO members. He called it &quot;Music from the Penguin Cafe&quot;, later shortened to simply Penguin Cafe. The all-new ensemble, sometimes inaccurately billed as The Penguin Cafe Orchestra, played at a number of festivals in 2009, combining Penguin Cafe numbers with new pieces. In 2010, they appeared at the BBC Proms (with Northumbrian piper Kathryn Tickell).

With the Penguin Cafe name now being used by Arthur, the original PCO members who wanted to continue playing their music needed an alternative name. Four of them, multiinstrumentalists Geoffrey Richardson and Jennifer Maidman, trombonist Annie Whitehead, and pianist Steve Fletcher, have since played some festivals as The Anteaters. They have been joined by percussionist Liam Genockey, well known as a member of Steeleye Span, and who played live with the Penguins in Italy in the 1980s. The name &#x27;Anteaters&#x27; came from an incident on the 1983 PCO tour of Japan when Simon Jeffes discovered there was a craze for penguins in the country. He joked that, if the fashion changed, the orchestra would have to change its name to &#x27;The Anteater Cafe Orchestra&#x27;. In October 2011, the same lineup appeared at the Canterbury Festival in Kent, UK, performing two hours of original PCO music as The Orchestra That Fell To Earth. They have continued to perform under that name.

The Penguin Cafe Orchestra&#x27;s most famous piece may be &quot;Telephone and Rubber Band&quot;, which is based around a tape loop of a UK telephone ring tone intersected with a reorder tone, accompanied by the twanging of a rubber band. It is featured on the soundtracks of Nadia Tass&#x27;s film comedy &quot;Malcolm&quot; (1986) and Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Talk Radio&quot; (1988), and in a long-running advertising campaign for the telecoms company One2One (now EE). The 1996 single &quot;In the Meantime&quot; by New York City-based English rockers Spacehog featured a tweaked and detuned sample of &quot;Telephone and Rubber Band&quot;. It was also the trademark song of &quot;Caloi en su tinta,&quot; an Argentinean TV show about artistic animation. The tape loop was recorded when Jeffes was making a phone call and discovered he was hearing a combination of a ring tone and an engaged signal due to a fault in the system. He recorded it on an answering machine.

===Music for a Found Harmonium===
Another famous tune featured in &quot;Malcolm&quot; (among other films) is &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot;, which Jeffes wrote on a harmonium he had found in a back street in Kyoto, where he was staying in the summer of 1982 after the ensemble&#x27;s first tour of Japan. He wrote that after installing the found harmonium &quot;in a friend&#x27;s house in one of the most beautiful parts at the edge of the city,&quot; he &quot;frequently visited this instrument during the next few months, and I remember the time fondly as one during which I was under a form of enchantment with the place and the time.&quot; &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was used in the trailer for, and over the end credits of, the 1988 John Hughes movie &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;. In the credits, many film actors and celebrities of the time invent their favourite name for an imagined child. (It was not included in the soundtrack released from the movie.)

&quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; gained exposure when it was released on the first Café del Mar volume in 1994. Because its rhythm, tempo and simple structure made it suitable for adaptation as a reel, it was subsequently recorded by many Irish traditional musicians, including Patrick Street, De Dannan, Kevin Burke and Sharon Shannon. An Irish traditional version was used on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Hear My Song&quot;, made in Ireland in the early 1990s. In 2004, Patrick Street&#x27;s cover of &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, and the following year in the film &quot;It&#x27;s All Gone Pete Tong&quot;. The Scottish folk rock band Rock Salt and Nails, from Shetland, also recorded a version of the song for their debut album &quot;Waves&quot; in 1993. The piece is also featured in the 2016 film, &quot;The Founder&quot;.

===Still Life at the Penguin Cafe===
Simon Jeffes composed music for the ballet Still Life at the Penguin Cafe, largely based on earlier compositions for the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. (Geoffrey Richardson co-wrote one of the pieces.) The ballet was first performed by the Royal Ballet in 1988, and the music was released as an album under Jeffes&#x27; name.

===Perpetuum Mobile===
Another of the group&#x27;s well-known pieces is &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; from their 1987 album &quot;Signs of Life&quot;. It has been used in several films, television and radio programmes, including as the main theme of the Australian stop-motion animated film &quot;Mary and Max&quot; (2009), and in the television adaptation of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Swedish DJ Avicii sampled the main melody for his song &quot;Fade into Darkness&quot;. Because it was written in the 15/8 time signature, the melody seems to end and repeat one beat sooner than expected, giving it the feel of a perpetual motion device.

===Numbers 1-4===
Another piece called &quot;Numbers 1-4&quot; was featured in a dance film shown on Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood episode 1604, when Mr. McFeely brings the video in to show. The film featured dancers from Pittsburgh&#x27;s Dance Alloy, who used fitness balls in the dance.

A number of pieces including &quot;Numbers 1-4&quot;, &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; and &quot;Music for A Found Harmonium&quot; were included on the soundtrack of the Channel 4 documentary series Road Dreams.

==Uses by others==
===Covers===
* &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was covered as a reel by the group Patrick Street on their 1990 album &quot;Irish Times&quot;, and subsequently by other folk acts including Galician band Matto Congrio in 1993, the California Guitar Trio on their &quot;Echoes&quot; album (2008), and by Irish accordion player Sharon Shannon on her first album. The tune was also covered by the pan-celtic violin ensemble Celtic Fiddle Festival in 1993, at the time consisting of former Silly Wizard fiddler Johnny Cunningham, Bothy Band fiddler Kevin Burke, and Kornog fiddler Christian Lemaitre, on their self-titled debut album. 
* &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was the basis for a mix by The Orb which appeared (along with both the original and the cover version by Patrick Street) on Penguin Cafe Orchestra&#x27;s 1996 &quot;best of&quot; album, &quot;Preludes, Airs and Yodels&quot;, and subsequently on The Orb&#x27;s own 2001 remix compilation &quot;&quot;Auntie Aubrey&#x27;s Excursions Beyond the Call of Duty - The Orb Remix Project, Volume 2&quot;&quot;. The title was given as &quot;Pandaharmonium&quot; on the former and &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium (Pandaharmoniumorb mix)&quot; on the latter.
* Avicii samples a section of &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; in his dance track &quot;Fade into Darkness&quot; (previously known as &quot;Penguin&quot;); the Leona Lewis/Avicii collaboration &quot;Collide&quot; also uses the same piano hook.
* &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was used as part of a tune set (&quot;Guns&quot;) by Roving Crows on their &quot;Deliberate Distractions&quot; album (2013)
* The main theme of &quot;Music for a Found Harmonium&quot; was used by Earl 16 on his 1997 track &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;.

The closing theme is &quot;The Ecstasy of Dancing Fleas&quot;.
* The first trailer for the John Hughes movie &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; consisted of edited-together, increasingly fast, dialogue-free clips from the movie with only this musical piece playing over them.
* &quot;Telephone and Rubber Band&quot; was used in the final sequence and at the start of the closing credits of &quot;Talk Radio&quot; (1988), directed by Oliver Stone.

* &quot;Music For a Found Harmonium&quot; is featured in &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; (2004), and the 2016 film &quot;The Founder&quot;.

===Radio/podcasts===
* &quot;This American Life&quot;, a popular show on public radio in the United States, has often used the band&#x27;s &quot;Perpetuum Mobile&quot; to accompany its stories, and news programs on National Public Radio have at times used the ringtone from &quot;Telephone and Rubber Band&quot; as bumper music between pieces.

<text>The Battle of Stångebro, or the Battle of Linköping, took place at Linköping, Sweden, on 25 September 1598 (O.S.) and effectively ended the personal union between Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, that had existed since 1592. In the battle, an army of c. 8,000–12,000 commanded by Duke Charles defeated a mixed force of c. 5,000–8,000 consisting of an invading army of mercenaries in the king&#x27;s employ and diverse but poorly co-ordinated supporting Swedish noblemen&#x27;s forces commanded by King of both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Sigismund III Vasa, who was acting to maintain and restore his personal union against anti-Catholic forces in Lutheran Sweden. The Swedish king&#x27;s general Constantin fought at the western bridge.

The battle was the beginning of the seven decades long Polish–Swedish Wars, which eventually destroyed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time, arguably the largest nation state in Europe and also led to fall of Swedish Empire in 1721. Like the Thirty Years&#x27; War which also involved Sweden, under the surface, the dynastic struggles were rooted firmly in religious strife between Protestants and Roman Catholics during the ongoing European wars of religion.

Sigismund was captured during the battle, but as the Polish–Lithuanian crowned head of state, was allowed to return to the commonwealth. He had engendered the civil war by violating his pledge to not interfere in religious matters in Sweden, nor to further the Catholic Counter-Reformation in Sweden.

==Background==
When King John III of Sweden died in 1592, his son Sigismund inherited the throne, despite his Catholic upbringing and despite already being King of Poland–Lithuania. However, he was refused coronation unless he agreed to the conditions of a clerical convention in Uppsala, making Sweden decisively Protestant. The debate was resolved in 1594, and freedom of religion was proclaimed, although only Protestants could hold high offices. The Swedish nobility also sought greater freedom and privileges. They were not granted these, but in the absence of the king, who spent most of his time in Poland, Sweden was to be ruled jointly by the Privy Council and Sigismund&#x27;s uncle, Duke Charles. At the Riksdag in Söderköping, summoned against the will of the king, Duke Charles was elected regent in the king&#x27;s absence. This was protested by Sigismund and those nobles loyal to him (mostly found in Finland after the king&#x27;s governor, Klaus Fleming, had put down a peasant uprising there).

Duke Charles sought to end the conflict by military means, but gained little support within the Privy Council. The new Riksens ständer he summoned at Arboga in 1597 – again despite the king&#x27;s orders – saw few participants, and only one from the Privy Council. Even so, he did not receive support for military action, but initiated it nonetheless. Parts of southern Sweden were taken. Several of the Privy Council members fled to Poland to convince Sigismund to take counteraction.

During the summer of 1598, Sigismund&#x27;s fleet took back Kalmar and continued northward. The force won a battle against the troops of Duke Charles at Stegeborg but soon found itself encircled and retired to Linköping. The support Sigismund had counted on from the Swedish people did materialize to some extent, splitting the Swedish armed forces into two hostile fractions.

==Battle==
At the time of the battle there were two bridges over the river Stångån, &quot;Stora Stångebro&quot; and &quot;Lilla Stångebro&quot;. Today this is a central part of Linköping, but in the 16th century the city did not extend east of the river. When the forces of Duke Charles approached from the east on the morning of 25 September, Sigismund&#x27;s army charged out of the city and met them at these bridges. A thick fog was instrumental at hiding the troop movements from their respective enemies. Both armies included small sections of cavalry.

The duke was the first to attack. He won a quick victory at Stora Stångebro and moved his troops over to Lilla Stångebro, where Sigismund&#x27;s forces had reached the eastern shore and defended a good position. The duke&#x27;s forces retired up a hill, where severe fighting followed. Sigismund&#x27;s cavalry did not engage in this fight, which led to a certain victory for Duke Charles.

At this point, Sigismund asked for a truce, which was accepted. According to propaganda from Duke Charles, his losses were light, only ca. 40 dead and slightly more than 200 wounded while King Sigismund lost 2,000 soldiers, many of them drowned in the river while they retreated.

==Aftermath==
In negotiations after the battle, Charles demanded that Sigismund send home his troops and surrender the Privy Council members loyal to him, and that the king himself stay to attend the Riksens ständer. Sigismund chose to leave the country instead, sailing back to Poland, but surrendering the Privy Council members in question.

Soon, only Kalmar was held by the king&#x27;s people. When it fell on 12 May 1599, Duke Charles had control over the entire country. When he asked the Riksens ständer at Linköping in 1600 for support as regent, it answered by proclaiming him king. He did not begin to use the title himself however, under the name Charles IX, until 1603. This Riksens ständer also appointed a court to judge those aristocrats who had fought with Sigismund in the battle. Eight were sentenced to death; five of the executions were carried out, including Erik Sparre, then-Lord High Chancellor of Sweden. This event, at the main square of Linköping on 20 March 1600, is known as the Linköping Bloodbath.

With Sigismund&#x27;s loss of the Swedish crown, the Polish–Swedish union was dissolved. A deep conflict between Sweden and Poland emerged; the nations would clash many times during the Polish–Swedish War, not to be resolved until the Great Northern War. Also, most remaining Catholic elements of Swedish society were wiped out, and Sweden became one of the foremost advocates of Protestantism, not least important during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

A monument was erected in 1898 at the battleground, immediately east of the river and close to the Stångebro sports field.

<text>Freddy vs. Jason is a 2003 American slasher film directed by Ronny Yu and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift. It is a crossover between &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, being the eighth installment in the former and the eleventh in the latter. The film stars Monica Keena, Kelly Rowland, Jason Ritter, Christopher George Marquette, Lochlyn Munro, and Robert Englund.

The film combines the two series in a shared universe and pits their respective antagonists, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, against each other. Freddy is weakened and forgotten because the citizens of his home town Springwood have defeated him by using medications that repress dreams. Freddy awakens Jason to stir up fear and grow his powers so that he may return and kill again. Jason turns out to not be as easily controlled as Freddy initially thought, and the two supernatural mass murderers come into conflict. The film is the last film in each franchise before their respective reboots: &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.

&quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but grossed $116.6 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in both franchises. The film marks Robert Englund&#x27;s final portrayal as Freddy Krueger .A sequel and crossover with the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; franchise was planned, but it was scrapped and turned into a comic book limited series, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash&quot;, and its follow-up &quot;The Nightmare Warriors&quot;.

==Plot==
Since Freddy Krueger&#x27;s last defeat, he has been in Hell, unable to invade children&#x27;s dreams as the adults of Springwood have gone to extremes to ensure their children forget him. All mention of him has been removed from public records, and any children who dream of him are forcibly institutionalized at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital to contain the spread. They are given the dream suppressant drug Hypnocil. Freddy resurrects Jason Voorhees after his last defeat and appears as Jason&#x27;s mother, Pamela Voorhees, to manipulate him into thinking his mother wants him to go to Elm Street and kill. This will create fear in the townsfolk that Freddy has returned, allowing him to regain his power.

Lori Campbell lives with her widowed father. During a sleepover with her friends Kia, Gibb, Gibb&#x27;s emotionally abusive boyfriend Trey, and his friend Blake, Jason murders Trey and then kills Blake and his father. The police label it a murder–suicide, hoping to conceal Freddy&#x27;s return from the town.

Lori&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Will Rollins, and his friend Mark Davis, who are involuntary psychiatric patients at Westin Hills due to their previous contact with Freddy, see a news report about the killings and decide to escape to warn Lori. That night, Lori and her friends attend a rave in a cornfield. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her first in the real world and goes on a murder rampage at the rave, angering Freddy, who realizes that Jason&#x27;s killing spree will deny him victims.

The friends escape the rave with school nerd Charlie and stoner Bill. Will reveals to Lori that he witnessed her dad killing her mom and he had him put in Westin to keep him from revealing the truth and they soon witness Mark getting killed by Freddy. Deputy Scott Stubbs helps the teens. Learning about Hypnocil, they try to steal it from Westin Hills to suppress their dreams; however, Freddy uses Bill to dispose of the medicine. Jason kills Stubbs. Freddy uses the possessed Bill to tranquilize Jason, causing him to fall asleep after slashing Bill in half.

The teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason, bringing the unconscious Jason back to Camp Crystal Lake in New Jersey. Freddy fights Jason in the dream world, where he discovers that Jason has a fear of drowning. He uses this to his advantage, causing Jason to revert to his younger self. Lori goes to sleep to pull Freddy out and save Jason. Freddy tortures Lori in her dream, revealing that he murdered her mother. Jason awakens at the real Camp Crystal Lake and pursues the teens, around the same time Lori wakes up and pulls Freddy into the physical world, where Jason confronts him, during this conflict Charlie fights off Jason in an attempt to save Kia and is thrown into a wall and impaled on a shelf bracket. Kia and Charlie get to safety with Kia promising to come back with help for Charlie but he bleeds out against a tree and dies as she runs for help.

As Freddy and Jason fight throughout the campgrounds, Kia sacrifices herself by distracting and taunting Freddy, allowing Lori and Will to escape and is killed by Jason. As Freddy gains the upper hand, Lori distracts him, allowing Jason to punch through his torso. Freddy plunges Jason&#x27;s machete into his side, and Jason rips off Freddy&#x27;s gloved arm. Lori and Will set the dock on fire, causing an explosion that throws Freddy and Jason into the lake. Freddy climbs out and is about to kill the pair but is impaled by Jason with his gloved arm, allowing Lori to behead Freddy with Jason&#x27;s machete. Jason, Freddy&#x27;s head, and his body sink into the lake, seemingly dead.

The next morning, Jason emerges from the lake, holding his machete and Freddy&#x27;s head. Freddy winks at the camera, leaving the winner ambiguous.

==Cast==
Additionally, Evangeline Lilly had a walk-on role as a high-school student. New Line Cinema studio chief Robert Shaye, who produced every preceding &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; film, played the school principal (credited as L.E. Moko).

==Production==
===Development===
Influenced by fan desire for a crossover film with a fight between Freddy and Jason, New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures tried to make a &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; movie in 1987. Frank Mancuso Jr. enlisted Tom McLoughlin to unite the studios, but no agreement could be made. When &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; failed at the box office, Sean S. Cunningham wanted to reacquire the rights to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and begin working with New Line Cinema on &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. Paramount and New Line wanted the license to the other&#x27;s character so they could control a crossover film. Negotiations on the project collapsed, and Paramount made &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;. After &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot; was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto (who sold them to New Line). Two years after initial talks fell apart, director Joseph Zito attempted to revive the project, but neither Mancuso nor Robert Shaye were interested in pursuing the project. Before Cunningham could begin to work on &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make &quot;New Nightmare&quot;. This put &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; on hold, but allowed Cunningham to bring Jason back with &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot;. The ninth installment &quot;turned a healthy profit&quot;. In a 1995 interview with &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Craven was dismissive of the idea of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, saying it was taking &quot;something that had a lot of impact and dignity and dragging it down to another level.&quot; Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;frustration&quot; with the delayed development of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; led him to create &quot;Jason X&quot; to keep the series alive. Based on &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;″s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film put the titular character in space. The film lost its biggest supporter with the resignation of president of production Michael De Luca. Lack of support let the finished film sit for two years before it was released on April 26, 2002. It was the series&#x27; lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office, and had the largest budget of any of the films to date. &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot; duo Adam Marcus and Dean Lorey were courted early on, but no official deal was finalized.

New Line spent a reported $6 million on script development alone from several different writers. Lewis Abernathy, writer of &quot;Deepstar Six&quot; and &quot;House IV&quot;, was the first screenwriter attached to the film. Abernathy sought to direct his script, entitled &quot;Nightmare 13: Freddy Meets Jason&quot;, but his limited directing experience prohibited him from doing so. David J. Schow was given an offer to write the script because he just happened to walk by De Luca&#x27;s office one day. Schow revised Abernathy&#x27;s script, expanding upon a cult that worships Freddy Krueger. In 1994, De Luca passed on the draft and turned to Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who wrote &quot;Jason vs. Freddy&quot;, which had a more &quot;adult tone&quot; than previous entries. The writing duo would depart the film and would be replaced by Peter Briggs, who impressed the studio with his previous crossover attempt, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. Briggs&#x27; draft saw numerous returning characters across several films. By 1996, &quot;Demon Knight&quot; scribes Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff were commissioned by Cunningham to write a new script, under the title &quot;Freddy vs. Jason: Millennium Massacre&quot;, with Rob Bottin, known for his make-up work on &quot;The Thing&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;, directing. New Line previously offered the spot to Guillermo del Toro and Peter Jackson to no avail. Bottin opted to drop the current draft of the script and penned his own treatment. David S. Goyer and his writing partner James Dale Robinson were subsequently hired to flesh out Bottin&#x27;s treatment into a screenplay. No parties involved were happy with the script, leading to Goyer and Robinson exiting the film. Bottin and his treatment were retained despite clashing with the studio over the film&#x27;s budget. Screenwriting duo Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, known for their work on &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, were selected by the director to write a new script. The draft was widely disliked at Cunningham Productions. Bottin initially considered revising the script himself, but ultimately left the film altogether.

In 1999, Mark Verheiden entered the project and proposed releasing the film with two different endings; one with Freddy winning and one with Jason winning. The next year, De Luca hired Mark Protosevich to write an entirely new script. &quot;Jason X&quot; writer Todd Farmer wrote for the film as well. Newcomers Mark Swift &amp; Damian Shannon were hired after delivering a pitch that De Luca was happy with in March 2002. Goyer returned to the project once again in an effort to trim &quot;every ounce of fat&quot; from Swift and Shannon&#x27;s 120-page script. Wes Craven, Guillermo del Toro, and Ronny Yu all declined the opportunity to direct the film. Rob Zombie turned the film down in favor to helm &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;. Then up-and-coming filmmaker Jaume Balagueró campaigned to direct the film. Yu would ultimately sign on to direct the film in May 2002 after being given an &quot;enormous&quot; amount of creative freedom. According to Swift and Shannon, several endings were considered for the film; one involved a surprise appearance from Pinhead of the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; franchise, but New Line did not want to secure the rights for the character.

===Casting===
In 1999, Robert Englund officially signed onto the film, marking his eighth appearance as the character of Freddy Krueger. In August 2002, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; revealed Kelly Rowland and Brad Renfro were cast in the film, while Kane Hodder would reprise his role as Jason Voorhees. However, conflicting reports emerged with &quot;IGN&quot; stating that the film was looking to reinvent the character, thus ditching Hodder. Monica Keena was selected to portray the film&#x27;s lead after an &quot;extensive search&quot;, while the supporting cast were made up of Canadian actors, including Katharine Isabelle, Lochlyn Munro, Brendan Fletcher, Tom Butler, David Kopp, Jesse Hutch, Kyle Labine and Zack Ward. Betsy Palmer was courted to reprise her role as Pamela Voorhees from &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, but declined due to salary disputes. Actress Paula Shaw would assume the role from Palmer. Just one week before production commenced, Jason Ritter was cast in place of Renfro.

===Casting Jason===
New Line, thinking that &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; needed a fresh start, chose a different actor to play Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing that Kane Hodder, who had played Jason in the previous four films, was the best choice for the role. Although Hodder received a script for &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; and met with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, Yu and Matthew Barry felt that the role should be recast to fit Yu&#x27;s image of Jason. Hodder said that New Line did not give him a reason for the recasting; according to Yu, however, he wanted a taller, slower and more-deliberate Jason. The role went to Ken Kirzinger, a Canadian stuntman who worked on &quot;Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;. Yu said that Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger is tall, compared to the Hodder, and Yu wanted a much taller actor than the Englund. Kirzinger believed that his experience on &quot;Part VIII&quot; (doubling for Hodder in two scenes) and his height helped him land the part. New Line did not cast Kirzinger until they saw him on film, and his first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. Douglas Tait played Jason in a re-shot ending:

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; has an approval rating of 41% based on 165 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Fans of the two horror franchises will enjoy this showdown. But for everyone else, it&#x27;s the same old slice and dice.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+-to-F scale.

Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, writing: &quot;FVJ ignores any attempts at cleverness and picks up storylines dropped in &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;Jason Goes to Hell&quot;&quot;. Sacha Molitorisz of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;this is a solid effort, with enough frights, humour, blood, surprises and killer dialogue to entertain consistently.&quot; Robert K. Elder of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying that it &quot;succeeds as a guilty pleasure, a monster mash that clobbers the recent lackluster sequels plaguing both legacies.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; published in 2023, Robert Englund said he was proud of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;: &quot;It took the genius of Ronny Yu. I&#x27;m really proud of that film. It&#x27;s really fun to see on a nice big flat screen with the sound turned up and some cold pizza.&quot;

===Accolades===
Doug Chapman and Glenn Ennis were nominated for the Best Fire Stunt award at the Taurus World Stunt Awards 2004 for the double full-body burn and wire stunt.

<text>In publishing, advertising and related fields, copy is written material, in contrast to photographs or other elements of layout, in books, magazines, newspapers and advertising.

In advertising, the term &quot;copy&quot; means the output of copywriters, who are employed to write material which encourages consumers to buy goods or services.

In newspapers and magazines, &quot;body copy&quot; (&quot;q.v.&quot;) is the main article or text that writers are responsible for, in contrast with display copy, accompanying material such as headlines and captions, which are usually written by copy editors or sub-editors.

In books, it means the text (manuscript, typescript) as written by the author, which the copy editor then prepares for typesetting and printing. This is also referred to as editorial copy, which is said to have two subdivisions, the body copy and the adjuncts to the body copy. The term&#x27;s usage can be demonstrated in the way an editor decides to embed an advertising material directly into the editorial copy, which means that the advertisement would use the same font, layout presentation, feel of the editorial copy it is being integrated into (or not, as the case may be). This concept underscores how the copy can also refer to the identity of the newspaper or the magazine since the method of composition and layout can define its brand and positioning.

<text>Alf Palmer (–1981), or  in the Warrongo language, was the last native speaker of the Australian aboriginal language Warrongo. He lived in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.

He worked together with linguists Drs. Tasaku Tsunoda from Japan and Peter Sutton from Sydney, Australia, to preserve his language. He was anxious for his language to be preserved and repeatedly told Tsunoda, &quot;I&#x27;m the last one to speak Warrungu. When I die, this language will die. I&#x27;ll teach you everything I know, so put it down properly.&quot;

<text>Gdov () is a town and the administrative center of Gdovsky District in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the river Gdovka, just from its outflow into Lake Peipus. Population: 

==History==
It was first mentioned in the beginning of the 14th century, as an outpost guarding the city of Pskov. Between 1431 and 1434, Pskovians built a fortress there, the remains of which can still be seen. It was attacked on numerous occasions by the Swedes and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (e.g., during the Russo–Swedish War (1590–1595) and the Ingrian War), and captured by the Swedes in 1614, but was finally returned to Russia in 1617 according to the Treaty of Stolbovo.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Gdov was made a part of Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). Gdov was mentioned as one of the towns into which the governorate was divided. In 1780, Gdov was granted town status; its coat of arms was granted on May 28, 1781. Between 1874 and 1912, Gdov issued Zemstvo stamps. The first stamp, worth two kopecks, appeared on April 16, 1874. Stamp production ceased, however, with the coming of World War I. In 1919, Gdov was an area where important events of the Russian Civil War and the Estonian War of Independence took place. Originally, the area east of Lake Peipus was under control of the revolutionary government. On May 15, 1919, the detachment under command of Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz (subordinate to General Aleksandr Rodzyanko) captured Gdov and the whole &quot;uyezd&quot; thus came under control by the White Army troops of Nikolai Yudenich. In November 1919, the Red Army recaptured Gdov.

On August 1, 1927, the &quot;uyezds&quot; and governorates were abolished and Gdovsky District, with the administrative center in Gdov, was established as a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Gdovsky Uyezd. On July 23, 1930, the &quot;okrugs&quot; were also abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940, Gdovsky District was part of the restored Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the &quot;okrugs&quot; abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union.

Between July 19, 1941 and February 4, 1944, Gdov was occupied by German troops and Waffen SS units from occupied Estonia. During the war two-thirds of Gdov&#x27;s population died. The town was seriously damaged during the war; of 640 buildings that existed in 1941, all but 34 were destroyed. Most of the devastation occurred just before the Nazi retreat on January 28, 1944, when the 37th Estonian Police Battalion, part of the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, set wooden buildings on fire and used explosives on stone structures. Among the destroyed historical buildings was the unique ensemble of two 15th and 16th-century churches that survived the Bolshevik anti-religion campaigns.

On August 23, 1944, the district was transferred to the newly established Pskov Oblast. The town was reconstructed during the 1950s and 1960s and continued to expand until the economic and demographic collapse of the early 1990s. In 1993 an exact copy of St. Dmitry Solounskiy church was built at its original location at the Gdov Kremlin, financed exclusively by crowdfunding.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gdov serves as the administrative center of Gdovsky District, to which it is directly subordinate. As a municipal division, the town of Gdov, together with sixty-two rural localities, is incorporated within Gdovsky Municipal District as Gdov Urban Settlement.

==Economy==

===Industry===
The economy of Gdov is based on the food and timber industries.

===Transportation===
A railway line via Gdov connecting Narva and Pskov was built before WWI. Later a new line from Gdov to Slantsy and Veimarn was constructed and used for passenger and cargo connections to Leningrad. During WWII the Gdov–Pskov stretch was destroyed, thus making Gdov the terminal station. There was one pair of passenger trains daily servicing the St. Petersburg–Gdov route. In the mid-2010s, passenger traffic between Slantsy and Gdov was discontinued for commercial reasons. The railway between Slantsy and Gdov was deserted and, as of 2021, mainly demolished.

Between the 1950s and 1980s an unpaved airfield in Gdov was used for commuter air transit to the neighbouring towns of Slantsy, Pskov and Tartu aboard an Antonov An-2 passenger biplane.

Gdov is connected by paved roads to Pskov, Kingisepp via Slantsy, and Plyussa. There are daily bus services to Pskov, Slantsy, Saint Petersburg, and neighbouring villages.

In the mouth of the Gdovka there is a harbour for fishing and leisure boats. However, due to the lack of customs and border guard offices, sailing to Estonia is not possible.

===Military installations===
During World War II Gdov briefly hosted the headquarters of the Chudskoye Lake Flotilla (1941).

The Russian Airforce base Smuravyevo, now abandoned, was located northeast of the town.

==Restricted access==
Gdov is included in the border security zone, intended to protect the borders of Russia from unwanted activity. Visits to the zone or transit through it are subject to the Frontier Regime Regulations set by the FSB that stipulate cases where permits are required or where holding a passport is enough. Permits may be obtained electronically via e-mail, four weeks ahead of the planned journey.

==Culture==

Gdov contains two cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twelve objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are archaeological sites. Gdov has a kremlin, an ancient fortress built in the 14th century. Only fragments of the original fortress walls have survived. The St. Dimitry Solounskiy Cathedral was destroyed in 1944 and reconstructed in 1993.

The only state museum in the district is the Gdov Museum of Regional History. It was founded in 1919, destroyed during the German occupation of Gdov, and rebuilt after World War II. The museum hosts historical and local interest collections.

==Notable people==
* Dmitri Iosifovich Ivanovsky (1864–1920; alternative spelling &quot;Dmitrii&quot; or &quot;Dmitry Iwanowski&quot; (), Russian botanist, co-discoverer of viruses (1892) and one of the founders of virology.

<text>Matthew William Bradley (born June 13, 1978) is a Canadian professional ice hockey scout and former player. He currently is a scout for the Washington Capitals. Bradley played in the National Hockey League for the San Jose Sharks, Pittsburgh Penguins, Washington Capitals and the Florida Panthers. He began working with the Washington Capitals as part of their scouting staff in 2015.

==Playing career==
Bradley grew up in the Ottawa suburb of Stittsville, Ontario, and played most of his minor hockey for the local Stittsville Rams &quot;C&quot; teams as well as AA for the Ottawa Valley Titans of the ODHA.

After a solid Bantam season in 1993–94 with the Titans, Bradley was drafted and signed with the Cumberland Grads of the Central Junior Hockey League (CJHL). He spent the 1994–95 season with the Grads before being selected in the 2nd round (31st overall) of the 1995 OHL Priority Selection by the Kingston Frontenacs.

Bradley was drafted by the San Jose Sharks in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, in the fourth round, 102nd overall. Prior to signing with the Washington Capitals, he also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins and San Jose Sharks.

Though he was not an offensive powerhouse, Bradley effectively carved out a niche for himself as a tough, checking line winger. In the 2007–08 season, Bradley doubled his fight total from the previous year, had a career-high 111 shots on goal, and was third among Capitals forwards in hits, even though he had the second lowest amount of ice time. Bradley improved his plus/minus rating in every season from 2003 to 2008.

Bradley was re-signed by the Capitals on May 27, 2008, to a three-year contract at $1,000,000 per season.

On July 3, 2011, Bradley signed a two-year, one-way contract with the Florida Panthers. In the 2011–12 season, Bradley appeared in only 45 games, his lowest since his rookie season, recording 8 points. With a limited role and dwindling future prospects in June 2012, the Panthers placed Bradley on waivers and subsequently bought out the remaining year on his contract.

With the 2012 NHL lockout in effect, and with limited interest, Bradley signed a month-by-month contract with Finnish second-division club TuTo Hockey on October 29, 2012. After just one game with TuTo, Bradley suffered another concussion and opted to end his agreement and return to Canada for rehabilitation on November 5, 2012.

<text>The English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) is a small breed of terrier in the toy dog group.

==Appearance==

According to the Kennel Club (UK), the English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) should be in height and in weight. The only permitted color is black with defined tan markings on the legs, chest, and face. The movement is described as being like the extended trot of a horse. The English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) has almond-shaped eyes and &#x27;candle-flame&#x27; ears.

==History==

The English Toy Terrier (ETT) (Black &amp; Tan) developed from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier and is closely related to the larger Manchester Terrier. Fast and agile, its origins are in the world of the rat pit, a sport popular in the cities of Victorian England where terriers were placed in a circle or pit with a number of rats and bets were taken as to which dog would kill its quota of rats in the fastest time. Small dogs were highly prized, with the ideal being to produce the smallest dog still capable of killing its quota of rats in as short a time as possible. In 1848 a Black and Tan Terrier named Tiny the Wonder, weighing just , is recorded to have killed 200 rats in less than an hour.

The outlawing of this sport coincided with the formation of the Kennel Club. With its elegant appearance, the Black and Tan Terrier moved into the conformation show ring. At the first all-breeds dog show, there was a very respectable entry of Black and Tan Terriers divided by weight. This weight division continued with two varieties of Black and Tan Terrier until 1903 when the 1st Black and Tan Terrier (Miniature) was registered with the KC. The current name English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) was adopted in 1960. Black and Tan Terriers of all sizes were exported to Canada and the US, founding a population which was largely isolated from the European one until very recently. In North America, the two sizes were also split into two breeds until 1958 when declining numbers of the Standard Manchester Terrier prompted the American Kennel Club to redefine them as a single breed with two varieties: Standard and Toy.
==Concerns of extinction==
The English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan) is on the Kennel Club (UK)&#x27;s list of vulnerable native breeds with an average of only 100 pups registered every year. A great effort is being made by breeders to boost the popularity of the breed and develop a viable gene pool. The Kennel Club (UK) has opened the stud book, allowing the North American Toy Manchester Terrier to be re-registered as the English Toy Terrier (Black &amp; Tan), provided it is certified to be of the Toy variety and not of the Standard variety. Some owners in Great Britain are against this decision; others see it as a positive way to preserve the breed.

<doc id="714348" wikidata="Q530773" url="?curid=714348" title="Augusto C. Sandino International Airport">
<text>Augusto C. Sandino International Airport () , or ACS, is the main joint civil-military public international airport in Managua, Nicaragua. It is named after Nicaraguan revolutionary Augusto Nicolás Sandino (1895–1934) and is located in the city&#x27;s 6th ward, known locally as &quot;Distrito 6&quot;. Originally christened &quot;Las Mercedes Airport&quot; in 1968, it was later renamed Augusto C. Sandino International Airport during the Sandinista government in the 1980s and again in 2001 to &quot;Managua International Airport&quot; by then-president Arnoldo Alemán. Its name was changed once more in February 2007 to its current name by President Daniel Ortega to honor the revolutionary. Managua also has an alternative landing strip at Punta Huete Airport. Punta Huete was designed for larger aircraft and thus has a longer landing strip (3,000m vs. MGA&#x27;s 2,442m). This alternative landing site, however, does not service commercial aircraft. The airport is managed by the state-run Administrative Company of International Airports, more commonly known as the &quot;EAAI,&quot; given its Spanish name, the &quot;Empresa Administradora de Aeropuertos Internacionales&quot;.

==History==
Managua previous airport, Xolotlan Airport, which was located about 2 miles east of Managua, built in 1915, and it quickly became too small for Managua&#x27;s airline service growth. In 1942, the Nicaraguan Government and Pan American Airways signed a contract to construct an airport by Las Mercedes Country Estate. Las Mercedes was further upgraded, re-designed to handle Boeing 707 aircraft, and re-inaugurated in July 1968 by Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

In the early 1970s, Las Mercedes was expanded to more modern standards; this included four health inspectors, eight immigration officers, and ten customs inspectors. It was considered fully equipped, having air conditioning, background music, loudspeakers, and conveyor belts for baggage handling. It also had a restaurant on its upper floor where visitors and travelers could see airport movement.

The expanded airport could serve three aircraft at once. By 1975, LANICA, Pan Am, KLM, TACA Airlines, Sahsa, Avianca, Iberia, SAM, TAN, Varig, and other carriers flew into Las Mercedes. When the Sandinistas took power, the airport was named after Augusto César Sandino, a Nicaraguan revolutionary and guerrilla leader, after whom the Sandinista movement is named. The Sandinistas, however, did not maintain the airport, and it began to deteriorate until it was expanded and remodeled in 1996, which installed two new boarding bridges. The airport was renamed &quot;Managua International Airport&quot; in 2001 by then President Arnoldo Alemán and renamed again in 2007 to its current name by President Daniel Ortega. In mid-2007, President Daniel Ortega renamed the airport in honor of Sandino. Nicaraguan artist Róger Pérez de la Rocha has created two large portraits of Augusto César Sandino and Rubén Darío; both of them lie in the lobby.

Las Mercedes served as a hub for many of Nicaragua&#x27;s flag carriers, such as LANICA (until 1978), Aeronica (1981–1992), and NICA (1992–2004). When NICA became a member of Grupo TACA during the 1990s, the number of important connections to the rest of Latin America from which ACS grew considerably.

According to EAAI (Empresa Administradora de Aeropuertos Internacionales), ACS is the most modern airport in Central America and the 4th safest in the world. It is located just from Managua&#x27;s downtown, has a runway that measures in length, and is at an elevation of .

==Expansion==
A large expansion program was underway by 2003, and as of July 2006, the final phase was completed. The airport was equipped with 7 gates with jetways and room for 20 airplanes to park. It had been reported in the recent past that the runway would be lengthened by , but this project has not begun, despite the government&#x27;s achievements in building new airports elsewhere in Nicaragua or greatly overhauling existing airport/airfield infrastructure in other locations as well.

Facilities within the airport include a tourist information desk, bank, restaurants, bars, post office, souvenir shops, duty-free shops, lounge, and more. The types of services in the VIP lounge include checking baggage and documents with customs and immigration plus the airline; a bar service, snacks, etc.

==Operations==
Augusto C. Sandino International Airport is Nicaragua&#x27;s main international gateway. Domestic flights fly between Bluefields, the Corn Islands, and Puerto Cabezas. The airport is accessed by the Panamerican Highway, known as the Carretera Norte.

<doc id="714349" wikidata="Q174162" url="?curid=714349" title="Casiguran, Sorsogon">
<text>Casiguran , officially the Municipality of Casiguran, is a municipality in the province of Sorsogon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 35,602 people.

==History==
Established in the year 1600, Casiguran was the first missionary parish of Sorsogon. When the Spaniards first set foot in this part of Luzon in the 1570s, Casiguran was considered as their center of Kabikolan.

In 1583, the Franciscan missionaries took over the evangelization work started by the Augustinians.

==Etymology==
There are two compelling thoughts for the origin of the town&#x27;s name.

The first is from the name of &quot;Gugurang&quot;, the supreme deity of the indigenous peoples of Bicol (called Ibalon during the pre-colonial era). 

A second is a folk legend, which narrates that the name is phonetically derived from the Bikol phrase &quot;&#x27;kasi gurang&quot;&#x27; (literally translated, &quot;because old&quot;) as it is Sorsogon&#x27;s ancient kingdom.

==Geography==
Casiguran is located at the coast of Sorsogon Bay, at the south of Luzon island, making it a suburb of neighboring Sorsogon City. It is from Sorsogon City and from Manila.

===Barangays===
Casiguran is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<doc id="714353" wikidata="Q924600" url="?curid=714353" title="War against Sigismund">
<text>The war against Sigismund () was a war between Duke Charles, later known as King Charles IX of Sweden, and Sigismund, who was at the time the king of both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (that is, the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania). Lasting from 1598 to 1599, it is also called the War of Deposition against Sigismund, since the focus of the conflict was the attempt to depose the latter from the throne of Sweden. The war eventually resulted in the deposition of Sigismund (with Duke Charles taking over the government and later also acceding to the throne), the dissolution of the Polish–Swedish union, and the beginning of an eleven-year war.

==Background==
When Stephen Báthory died in 1586, Sigismund Vasa, son of King John III and Catherine Jagiellonica, was elected king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in an attempt to continue the Polish–Swedish alliance, the original purpose being to confront Ivan IV &quot;the Terrible&quot; of Russia. Sigismund had sworn to cede Estonia to the Commonwealth.

When King John III died in 1592 his son Sigismund, King of Poland since 1587, acceded to the Swedish throne. Then conflicts arose. Duke Charles, the only living son of Gustav Vasa, did not approve the accession of Sigismund, his nephew and a Catholic, to the government of a realm that could just as well be his.

After Sigismund had been crowned King of Sweden on February 19, 1594, he decided that no Parliaments (&quot;riksdagar&quot;) could be summoned without the King&#x27;s consent. Despite this, Charles summoned a Parliament at Söderköping in autumn 1595, at which he managed to get his will through. The Duke was appointed Regent with &quot;the advice of the Council&quot;, meaning that he was to govern Sweden together with the Privy Council during the King&#x27;s absence from the Realm. Soon afterwards, the nobility of Finland, led by the Sigismund-appointed Governor, Klaus Fleming, rejected these decisions. They sympathised with the King and considered Charles a rebel. As a counterattack, Charles instigated a rebellion against Fleming, the Cudgel War, among the farmers in Ostrobothnia.

Fleming managed to quell the revolt but died in April 1597. Roughly at the same time, a letter arrived from Sigismund&#x27;s headquarters in Poland stating that he would not accept Charles as regent. The Duke then used a tactic which his father had employed, namely to resign from office. However, the response was not what Charles had been hoping for: the King accepted Charles&#x27;s resignation and invested complete power in the Privy Council.

Despite the difficult situation, Charles summoned another illegal Parliament the same year, this time in Arboga. Only one of the Privy Councillors showed up. The reason was that Charles&#x27;s goal of deposing Sigismund had now been revealed, and the men understood that a serious revolt was brewing. When Duke Charles threatened the absent men with severe punishment some of them lost courage. Erik Gustavsson Stenbock, Arvid Gustavsson Stenbock, Erik Sparre, Erik Brahe, and fled immediately to Sigismund.

Thus, in 1597, civil war erupted, and Duke Charles was able to assume control over a large share of the powerful castles in the country, and in this manner achieved control over almost all the Realm. The problem was Finland, where Klaus Fleming&#x27;s widow guarded Åbo castle. But after psychological warfare, Charles and his followers managed to take the castle in Turku (). It is said that when the Duke entered the castle chapel he saw Klaus Fleming&#x27;s body lying in a coffin. He is said to have said: &quot;Hadst thou now been alive, thy head would not have been in great safety.&quot; Then Fleming&#x27;s widow Ebba Stenbock is said to have approached the Duke and responded: &quot;If my late husband had been alive, Your Grace would never have entered herein.&quot;

When Sigismund found out about what had happened in Finland he lost his patience. The King could not accept Duke Charles&#x27;s disrespectful actions. He decided to use force.

==The Sausage Campaign and the fall of Kalmar==
In February 1598 Sigismund assembled an army consisting of merely 5,000 men, mostly Hungarian and German mercenaries. A larger army had been proposed, but had been dismissed since Sigismund expected Swedish forces to join him, and also did not want to come into conflict with them.

The advisers and the King expected military support from Finland and Estonia (homes of the Swedish gentry formerly commanded by baron Klaus Fleming). They also wanted help from Denmark–Norway and pro-Sigismund parts of Sweden. The diplomat Laski was dispatched, but Denmark did not show any interest.

In May, Sigismund&#x27;s men started to advance northwards. The army gathered in Marienburg (Malbork), where the Livonian Baltic German Jürgen Farensbach was appointed commander. The army was to be transported from Danzig (Gdańsk) to Sweden on Swedish ships, but the Swedish Estates declined. They refused to lend him ships as long as he stayed with a foreign army. There was widespread suspicion against Sigismund and his Catholic warriors. Thus the Estates promised to protect Duke Charles and the others who rebelled against the King.

Since the Swedes refused to help with the transport, Sigismund had to buy and capture ships. When he had got hold of a hundred ships, the army was able to begin its journey to Sweden. Due to bad winds, the journey across the sea took a long time. Hence, a coordinated attack by the Finns and Sigismund&#x27;s Polish soldiers could not be undertaken. The Finnish soldiers, commanded by Governor Arvid Eriksson, landed in Uppland one week ahead of Sigismund&#x27;s landing. Duke Charles was on his way to Kalmar when the Finns invaded Uppland. He immediately rode towards Stockholm to defend the city.

Meanwhile, three Protestant leaders, Nicolaus Olai Bothniensis, Laurentius Paulinus Gothus, and , attempted to stop the Finnish Sigismund loyalists. They were able to get the support of the farmers of Uppland, and after some minor fighting, Stålarm&#x27;s men withdrew. They felt threatened by Duke Charles&#x27;s navy, and were ordered not to get involved in any major battles. This event has been somewhat peculiarly named the &quot;Sausage Campaign&quot;, because the farmers captured the Finns’ bags, containing sausages. The Sausage Campaign was a minor victory for Duke Charles. The greatest threat was coming from the south.

At the end of May 1598 Sigismund landed on Danish soil at Avaskär, near the border to Sweden. The King opened peacefully by sending the diplomat Samuel Łaski to Kalmar for negotiations. His task was to convince the city&#x27;s commanders to open the gates. However, the negotiations led nowhere. Instead, the King took his soldiers and marched on Kalmar. The army halted just outside the city. The plan was to frighten the commanders into opening the gates. To make his message even more terrifying, Sigismund threatened the city with severe punishments and to withdraw the nobility of all children in the city. The propaganda worked well and Sigismund was able to make his long-desired entry on August 1.

==Decisive events==
After the fall of Kalmar, Duke Charles found himself with major trouble on his hands. The Polish Crown army attracted Swedish followers and Stockholm, lacking military defence, was easily taken with the help of the nobility and officers of Götaland. After this event, the cavalry of Uppland joined up with Sigismund, and new forces were mobilised in Finland and Estonia.

A group of envoys from Brandenburg, Prussia, and Mecklenburg shuttled back and forth between Duke Charles&#x27;s and Sigismund&#x27;s camps for three weeks, trying to rescue the peace. Despite their great efforts, they failed. Sigismund sailed with his infantry to Stegeborg Castle on August 11. The cavalry went to the same place by land. Charles&#x27;s situation was hardly optimal. The only bright spots were the escapement of , the ex-commander of Stockholm, from the city, and the Swedish navy&#x27;s refusal to join forces with the Poles.

Łaski took Stockholm Castle and Sigismund now had control over Stockholm, the key to Sweden. However, Sigismund and his fleet sailed into a violent storm: hundreds of men were thrown overboard and perished. This incident dramatically changed the situation. Suddenly, the King was in an exposed position. On August 22 he landed at Stegeborg with merely 100 men, a position worsened by the presence of Charles&#x27;s rested army nearby. Sigismund&#x27;s men had already taken the fortresses of Älvsborg and Gullberg in other parts of the country. In the area around Stegeborg, Duke Charles had withdrawn to Linköping, from where he could block the troop supply to Sigismund. The King was surrounded by in all 7,000 men, including the Swedes who joined him after landing.

On August 28, Duke Charles and his men set out from Linköping. They camped at Mem, a few kilometres northwest of Stegeborg. At the same time, negotiations between the parties were ongoing. The Duke requested clear-cut answers from Sigismund, which the King interpreted as indicating that an assault was impending. His own army was in a trap, but he counted on help from other forces elsewhere. Hans Vejer was ordered to attack the Swedes in the back, from the west; another commander, Farensbach, drew up his forces in order of battle in front of the enemy. Charles immediately responded.

On the morning of September 8, the Swedes attacked Sigismund in the Battle of Stegeborg. The Swedes got off to a real nightmare start, and after a few hours, Sigismund&#x27;s victory was clear. Being magnanimous, the King ordered the killing to stop, allowing Charles and his army to escape.

The losing Swedes quickly withdrew to their camp at Mem Castle. The losses amounted to 300 men, but the loss of prestige hurt Charles the most. He felt himself further humiliated by Sigismund&#x27;s magnanimous behaviour. The strain grew so big that the normally stubborn Charles wanted to abdicate and escape the country with his family. A few senior officers managed to persuade Charles to stay, however.

The negotiations were resumed and they led to a two-day ceasefire. During these days, there was plenty of maneuvering among the forces. Sigismund summoned more soldiers from Poland, at the same time as the Swedish navy sailed towards the coast. The King was in charge of the situation until the Swedish navy, commanded by Joachim Scheel, anchored outside Stegeborg. Because of unfavorable winds, they had not been able to do this before. But once they had got there, the tables turned again. Since Scheel brought with him new forces, Charles could raise the stakes in the negotiations. The navy also blocked any reinforcements to Sigismund from Poland.

Sigismund immediately felt threatened and treated the blockade as a declaration of war. For this reason, he and the Poles left Stegeborg on September 20 to march on Linköping. Duke Charles&#x27;s army immediately followed. The night of September 25 minor detachments skirmished with each other.

The morning of September 25, 1598 the armies clashed in a major engagement at the Battle of Stångebro. Charles offered talks again but attacked in a mist while Sigismund&#x27;s men were withdrawing to their camp, which resulted in only the mercenaries fighting since his Swedes refused to fight. Duke Charles won a decisive victory which forced Sigismund to agree to harsh terms. Charles demanded that the King send home his entire army, but that he himself was to stay and await a Parliament. Also, a number of Swedes who had sided with Sigismund, including his Council supporters, were captured. These were later executed in the Linköping Bloodbath of 1600.

The agreement was sealed with a dinner between Charles and Sigismund in Linköping Castle. The King, who was under pressure, fearing for his life without his army and having realised that he had lost the political battle, fled during the coming days to Poland in late 1598. At the same time as the peace treaty was being signed in Linköping, conflicts were taking place in Dalarna. There, a pro-Sigismund bailiff, , had tried to raise up the Dalecarlians against Duke Charles. Chaos ensued. Näf was executed, and the Dalecarlians set out on the so-called Neaf Campaign (1598), burning and killing down to Brunnbäck ferry. In Västergötland, Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, illegitimate son of Duke Charles, defeated the rebellion.

==Year 1599==
The King had planned to return to Sweden, which raised morale among his followers. However, these plans were never put into action. But the war had not ended. It continued for a few months, as Charles tried to reclaim the cities that were still in Sigismund&#x27;s hands.

He started by appointing a new city government in Stockholm. Then he scolded the burghers, who he claimed hadn&#x27;t defended the city enough. It all finished with a lot of people being jailed, among them Archbishop Abraham Angermannus, who had supported Sigismund.

Then Swedish forces, led by Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, marched towards Kalmar to lay siege to the city. Johan Larsson Sparre defended the walls and the castle in the hope that the King would return to Sweden. But he never got any assistance and the night between March 1 and March 2 the city was assaulted. Gyllenhielm and Samuel Nilsson were ordered to attack the north gate. Duke Charles himself led the attack on the western gate. After a short and sharp fight, Charles&#x27;s men managed to scale the walls. Since the soldiers began looting the city, however, the opportunity to capture Kalmar Castle in the same stroke was lost.

The coming days, the castle proved more tenacious than expected. Johan Larsson Sparre kept the Swedes away, and finally six Polish ships arrived. These, however, were driven back by four smaller Swedish ships and Swedish artillery fire from within the city. When the Polish ships were unable to do anything, hope disappeared for the defenders inside the castle. On May 12, they surrendered. After that, Johan Larsson Sparre and his closest men, including Christoffer Andersson Stråle and , were captured.

After the assault and capture of Kalmar, the focus of the war moved to Finland. Stronghold after stronghold began to be captured in July. At first, Hans Klasson Bielkenstierna and Peder Stolpe commanded the battle against Sigismund&#x27;s followers, but on August 19, Duke Charles personally assumed command. With the help of the navy, he crushed the last remnants, and by September all of Sigismund&#x27;s followers were gone, detained, or executed, e.g., in the Åbo bloodbath.

==Aftermath and consequences==
Sigismund was officially deposed from the throne of Sweden by a Parliament, Riksdag, held in Stockholm on July 24, 1599. He was given six months to say whether he wanted to send his son, Prince Ladislaus of Poland, to Sweden as his successor, under the condition that the boy would be brought up in the Evangelical faith. Otherwise the Estates would look for a new king.

In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Linköping. Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King Charles IX of Sweden. The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating. The most prominent among them were killed by the new King, in what was called the &quot;Linköping Bloodbath&quot;.

During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund. Charles&#x27; invasion of Livonia led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the Second Polish–Swedish War.

Charles accepted the crown as Charles IX in 1604.

<doc id="714358" wikidata="Q962987" url="?curid=714358" title="Quadrophenia (film)">
<text>Quadrophenia is a 1979 British drama film, based on the Who&#x27;s 1973 rock opera of the same name. It was directed by Franc Roddam in his feature directing debut. Unlike the adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is not a musical film, and the band does not appear live in the film.

The film, set in London in 1964, depicts a period of emotional turmoil in the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young Mod who escapes from his dead-end job as a postroom boy by dancing, partying, taking amphetamines, riding his scooter and brawling with Rockers.

==Plot==
In 1964, young London Mod Jimmy Cooper, disillusioned with his parents and a dull job as a post-room boy at an advertising firm, vents his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave, Chalky and Spider.

An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliatory attack on Jimmy&#x27;s childhood friend Kevin, one of the rival Rockers. Jimmy initially participates, but on realising the victim is Kevin, he berates the other attackers but does not stop them, instead riding away on his scooter, revving his engine loudly in frustration.

A planned bank holiday weekend away provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to escalate, as both groups descend on the seaside town of Brighton. Jimmy plans to be noticed as a &#x27;face&#x27; and hints to Steph – a girl on whom he has a crush – that he would like her to ride with him, but she confirms plans to ride instead with Pete, an older, Mod.

To prepare for the weekend, the friends attempt to buy some recreational drugs from London gangster Harry North but are cheated with fake pills. After vandalising the drug-seller&#x27;s car in retaliation, they desperately rob a pharmacy, finding a large quantity of their favourite &quot;blues&quot;.

After an early morning group ride from London to the south coast, the friends gather on the seafront, where Jimmy first sees a flamboyant scooter-riding Mod he describes as &quot;Ace Face&quot;. Later, in a dance hall, Jimmy suggests that he will help Steph, whose escort is now chatting to an attractive American girl, to dance with Ace Face but on the dance floor ushers her away to dance by himself. Steph leaves Jimmy to dance with Ace Face, whereupon Jimmy plots to gain attention by climbing up onto the balcony-edge and dancing with much applause, annoying Ace Face. After diving into the audience, Jimmy is ejected by bouncers. Steph&#x27;s escort leaves with the American girl.

The lads spend the night sleeping rough, meet up at a cafe the following morning, then proceed along the promenade, where a series of running battles ensues. As the police corner the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves amidst the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested and detained with the volatile Ace Face. When fined a hefty £75——Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, impressing the fellow Mods with his presumed wealth.

Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. His mother throws him out after finding his stash of amphetamine pills. He then leaves his job, spends his severance package on more pills and learns that Steph is now his friend Dave&#x27;s girlfriend. After briefly fighting with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph, and his beloved Lambretta scooter is damaged in a crash involving a Royal Mail parcel van. Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton, taking increasing levels of pills and becoming more emotionally unstable.

Lonely and unsure what to do with himself, he revisits the scenes of the riots and his encounter with Steph. Then Jimmy is shocked to discover that his idol, Ace Face, has a menial job as a bellboy at the Grand Brighton Hotel. Jimmy steals Ace&#x27;s Vespa scooter and heads to Beachy Head, riding close to the cliff-edge. For a time, he appears to be having an enjoyable ride in the sunshine, but then he stops and glares miserably at the sea. Finally, the scooter is seen crashing over the cliff-top, which is where the film began (with Jimmy walking back against a sunset backdrop).

==Cast==
John Lydon (Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols) screen-tested for the role of Jimmy Cooper. The distributors of the film refused to insure him for the role and he was replaced by Phil Daniels.

Most of the cast were reunited after 28 years at Earls Court on 1 and 2 September 2007 as part of The Quadrophenia Reunion at the London Film &amp; Comic Con run by Quadcon.co.uk. Subsequently, the cast agreed to be part of a Quadrophenia Convention at Brighton in 2009.

Several references to the Who appear throughout the film as &quot;Easter eggs&quot;, including an anachronistic inclusion of a repackaged Who album that was not available at the time, a clip of the band performing &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot; on the television series &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, pictures of the band and a &quot;Maximum R&amp;B&quot; poster in Jimmy&#x27;s bedroom, and the inclusion of &quot;My Generation&quot; during a party gatecrashing scene. The film was almost cancelled when Keith Moon, the drummer for the Who, died, but in the words of Roddam, the producers, Roy Baird and Bill Curbishley, &quot;held it together&quot; and the film was made.

Only one scene in the film was shot in the studio; all others were on location. Beachy Head, where Jimmy considers suicide at the film&#x27;s ending, is 14 miles from Saltdean, the site of the real-life cliffside death of a young mod in 1964 that Roddam has said inspired Townshend&#x27;s original concept, though Townshend has denied this.

Jeff Dexter, a club dancer and disc jockey fixture in the Sixties London music scene was the DJ in the club scenes, and was the uncredited choreographer of 500 extras for the ballroom and club scenes. He also choreographed Sting&#x27;s feet in his dance close-ups. Dexter managed America.

Trevor Laird (Ferdy) was scripted to appear in a party scene kissing and having sex with a white girl, but was excluded from the scene by associate producer John Peverall due to concerns that it could cause problems with distributors in South Africa and the southern United States. Toyah Willcox has said that cast members discussed going on strike over the incident.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is the soundtrack album to the 1979 film of the same name, which refers to the 1973 rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. It was initially released on Polydor Records in 1979 as a cassette and LP and was re-released as a compact disc in 1993 and 2001. The album was dedicated to Peter Meaden, a prominent Mod and first manager of the Who, who had died a year before the album&#x27;s release.

The album contains ten of the seventeen tracks from the original rock opera &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (as not all of the tracks were used in the film). These are different mixes from those that appear on the 1973 album as they were remixed in 1979 by John Entwistle. The most notable difference is the track &quot;The Real Me&quot; (used for the title sequence of the film) which features a different bass track, more prominent vocals and a more definite ending. Most of the tracks are also edited to be slightly shorter. The soundtrack also includes three tracks by the Who that did not appear on the 1973 album.

==Release==
The film was first shown during the Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 1979. The film had its premiere at the Plaza cinema in London on 16 August 1979. It opened to the public the following day and grossed £36,472 in its opening week from four cinemas in London, placing second behind &quot;Moonraker&quot; at the London box office.

===Reception===
Janet Maslin, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1979, called it &quot;...gritty and ragged and sometimes quite beautiful&quot;, creating a &quot;...slice-of-life movie that feels tremendously authentic in its sentiments as well as its details.&quot; Maslin states that the director&#x27;s scenes of youth battles &quot;...capture a fierce, dizzying excitement that epitomizes a kind of youthful extreme.&quot; Reviewer Brian Gibson from &quot;Vue Weekly&quot; (Edmonton, Canada) stated that &quot;Roddam&#x27;s look back at an angsty young man in &#x27;65 is a throwback to the kitchen-sink dramas that began plumbing the depths of working class lives then. Reeking with a restless teen spirit, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; leads us down adolescence&#x27;s blind alleys of rebellion.&quot; Critic Matt Brunson
from &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; stated that the film &quot;[m]anages to be both quintessentially British and irrefutably universal&quot;, giving it a 3.5/4 score. Reviewer Eric Melin from Scene-Stealers.com states that the film has a &quot;...gritty, realistic feel and the themes of youthful rebellion and confusion are absolutely timeless, magnified by the specificity of the setting rather than being limited by it&quot;; he also gave the movie a 3.5/4 score. Reviewer Christopher Long from &quot;Movie Metropolis&quot; commented that &quot;[w]hen you&#x27;re an angry young man [like the main character], there&#x27;s no better way to prove you&#x27;re an individual than to dress and act exactly like everybody else&quot;; Long gave the film a 6/10 score.

Dennis Schwartz from &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot; stated that the &quot;...film lives through the superb raw angst-ridden performance of [lead] Phil Daniels&quot;; Schwartz gave the movie a B+. Critic Cole Smithey from ColeSmithey.com called the film a &quot;...glorious representational story of male teen angst that transcends its British locations and great music with a sense of the confused romantic notions that young men the world over carry with them&quot;; Smithey gave the film an A+. Reviewer Ken Hanke from the &quot;Mountain Xpress&quot; (Asheville, NC) called it a &quot;[d]isappointing film version of a great concept album&quot;; he gave the film a 3/5 score. Film critic Jeffrey M. Anderson from &quot;Combustible Celluloid&quot; states that where the film &quot;...succeeds[, it does so] through its devil-may-care attitude and energy&quot;; on the other hand, Anderson states that the film &quot;...feels like a low-budget homemade movie from the period.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes collected reviews from 14 critics and gave &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; a 100% rating.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

===Home media===

Sirius Publishing, Inc. released the film on the now defunct MovieCD format in 1991. The package included 3 discs for the movie itself along with other promotional material for the format and other films offered by Sirius on MovieCD. The packaging also carries the logo for Rhino Home Video indicating some form of involvement in this release.

Universal Pictures Home Entertainment first released the film on DVD in the United Kingdom in 1999 with an 8-minute montage featurette. It used the VHS print, resulting in a much lower-quality video than expected. Following this in the United States was a special edition by Rhino, which included a remastered letterboxed wide screen transfer, a commentary, several interviews, galleries, and a quiz. However, it was a shorter cut of the film, with several minutes of footage missing.

Rhino Home Video released the film on DVD on 25 September 2001.

On 7 August 2006, Universal improved upon their original UK DVD with a Region 2 two-disc special edition. The film was digitally remastered and included a new commentary by Franc Roddam, Phil Daniels and Leslie Ash. Disc 2 features an hour-long documentary and a featurette with Roddam discussing the locations. Unlike their previous DVD, it was the complete, longer version, and it was matted to the correct aspect ratio.

The Criterion Collection released a special edition version of this movie on 28 August 2012, on both DVD and Blu-ray formats.

<doc id="714361" wikidata="Q7970854" url="?curid=714361" title="Warrongo language">
<text>Warrongo (or War(r)ungu) is an Australian Aboriginal language, one of the dozen languages of the Maric branch of the Pama–Nyungan family. It was formerly spoken by the Warrongo people in the area around Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Its last native speaker was Alf Palmer, who died in 1981.

Before his death, linguists Tasaku Tsunoda and Peter Sutton worked together with Palmer to preserve the language (Warrungu proper); thanks to their efforts, the language is beginning to be revived. Classes have been held by Tsunoda since 2002.

One of the notable feature of the language is its syntactic ergativity.

As noted by Ethnologue, the language is currently dormant meaning that there are no native/proficient speakers left.

Alternative names for the language include &quot;Warrangu&quot;, &quot;Warrango&quot;, &quot;War(r)uŋu&quot;, &quot;War-oong-oo&quot;, &quot;Gudjala&quot; and &quot;Gudjal&quot;.

The &quot;Warungu&quot; language region includes areas from the Upper Herbert River to Mount Garnet.

==Sociolinguistic situation==
Nowadays people identifying themselves as Warrongo live both within traditional Warrongo territory (Mount Garnet) and outside it (Palm Island, Townsville, Ingham, Cardwell, and Cairns). The language has been extinct since the last speaker, Alf Palmer, died in 1981. In the late 1990s or early 2000s a language revival movement started by a community of people, most of them grandchildren of the last speakers, the central figure being Rachel Cummins, the granddaughter of Alf Palmer. The community had contacted Tsunoda, the linguist who worked with the last speakers in the 1970s, and between 2002 and 2006 he conducted 5 sessions of lessons, of 4–5 days each. As a result, the language seems to have acquired a limited set of symbolic functions. It has begun to be used in teasing between children, and as a source of personal names.

==Classification==
There appear to have been at least two mutually intelligible dialects. Warrongo belongs to the Pama-Nyungan (macro)family. The most closely related languages are Gugu Badhun (90% lexical sharing in terms of Hale&#x27;s 99-item vocabulary) and Gujal (94% lexical sharing). The intermediate level classification of this group seems uncertain: the evidence from phonological correspondences, pronouns and verb roots suggests it belongs to the Maric group (alongside Bidjara, Gungabula, Marganj, Gunja, Biri and Nyaygungu), while the verbal inflectional morphology is akin to that of the Hebert River group (which includes Dyirbal, Warrgamay, Nyawaygi and Manbarra). It has been suggested that the verbal inflectional suffixes might have been the result of massive borrowing.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===

# Only in Gugu-Badhun.

The sound appears only in the interjection &#x27;Hi!&#x27; and the exclamation of surprise (or ) Dentalized consonants tend to appear in the Gugu-Badhun dialect. An alveolar approximant is stated to appear in the Gugu-Badhun dialect as well. The retroflex approximant in syllable-final position can infrequently be realised as a retroflex tap .  The lamino-palatal stop is in most instances phonetically an affricate or .
Voicing is not distinctive for stops . The rules for voicing are fairly complex, but still it is impossible to predict it in all instances . The factors involved are the place of articulation (the more front the stop, the more likely it is to be voiced), the phonetic environment, position with respect to word boundaries, and possibly also the length of the word, the number of syllables that follow the stop and the location of stress.

===Vowels===
There are three vowels: , and (orthographically ). Length is distinctive only for , its long counterpart is orthographically represented as . has two allophones: , and (neither of which involve significant lip rounding), depending on the preceding consonant. Both are possible after , and , while after all other consonants only appears. The allophony of seems to be governed by more complex rules but generally, is the sole allophone after ˌ ˌ and , while after almost all other consonants both and can be observed.

==Word classes==
Warrongo is analysed as having five word classes: nouns, (personal) pronouns, adverbs, verbs and interjections. Most of these contain interrogative and demonstrative members; example of an interrogative noun is &#x27;what&#x27;, &#x27;there&#x27; is a demonstrative adverb, an interrogative verb is &#x27;to do what&#x27;, and a demonstrative one is &#x27;to do thus&#x27;. Almost all words belong exclusively to a word class, while change of word class is achieved through derivational suffixes. Adjectives do not form a separate class as they share the morphology and syntactic behaviour of nouns. There are also about a dozen enclitics, with a range of functions: emphasis, focus, intensification, or meanings like &#x27;only&#x27;, &#x27;enough&#x27;, &#x27;too&#x27;, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know&#x27;, &#x27;counterfactual&#x27;.

==Nominal morphology==
Nouns generally do not distinguish number or gender, while pronouns have different forms for number (singular, dual and plural) and person (first, second and third). All of them do, however, inflect for case. The case suffixes have allomorphs according to the final phoneme of the stem, with some peculiarities exhibited by pronouns and by vowel-final proper and kin nouns . There are also a few irregular nouns.

===Cases===
Nouns have a single form, unmarked by a suffix, for the nominative case (used for the subject of an intransitive verb) and the accusative case (used for the object of a transitive verb), while the ergative case (used for the subject of a transitive verb) is marked by a suffix. In pronouns, on the other hand, the nominative and the ergative coincide in the bare stem form, while the accusative is marked by a suffix. Exceptionally, the third person dual and plural pronouns, as well as vowel-final proper and kin nouns, receive separate marking for each of these three cases. The ergative, if used with inanimate nouns, may also mark an instrument.

The locative case describes path or destination of movement, location, duration in time, instrument (and means), company (&#x27;together with&#x27;), and cause or reason. The dative case marks purpose, cause and reason, possession (rarely), goal and direction of movement, recipient, temporal duration or endpoint, a core argument in some syntactic constructions, and a complement of intransitives verbs or nouns like &#x27;fond (of)&#x27;, &#x27;good (to)&#x27;, &#x27;know&#x27;, &#x27;forget&#x27;. The genitive is used only with animate nouns and marks, besides the typical possessor and related functions, also a beneficiary, recipient, or complement of some verbs and nouns. The ablative most commonly marks reason or a temporal or spatial starting point. The comitative seems to have a wide range of meanings, some of them idiomatic, but the most typical seem to correspond to English &#x27;with&#x27;.

Genitive, ablative and comitative suffixes may be followed by other case suffixes.
Some adverbs can take case suffixes: locative (optionally for adverbs of place), dative (with the sense &#x27;to&#x27;, optionally for adverbs of place, obligatory for adverbs of time), or ablative (obligatory for both if the meaning is &#x27;from, since&#x27;). Adverbs of manner cannot take case suffixes – this distinguishes them from nouns that express similar meanings (as these nouns must agree in case with the nouns they modify).

==Verbal morphology==
Verbs belong to one of three conjugation classes, which are characterised by the presence of a &#x27;conjugational marker&#x27; (-l-, -y- or none) which appears in certain verb forms. Verbs take suffixes for change of valency or for tense/mood (future tense, between two and three non-future tenses, imperatives, apprehensional). There are also purposive forms, which signal intention when used as the predicate of a non-subordinate clause, or mark verbs in subordinate clauses for purpose, result or successive actions.

==Syntax==

===Word order===
Word order is free and does not seem to be governed by information structure. Constituents of a single phrase need not be contiguous. There are however some tendencies. Numeral nouns usually follow the head noun, while adjective-like modifiers tend to precede it. Arguments tend to precede verbs, while the agent-like argument of a transitive verb more often than not precedes the patient-like argument, although more frequently only one of them is expressed.

===Complex sentences and coreferentiality===
The three most common means of joining clauses are sentence-sequence (juxtaposed clauses that have separate intonation contours), coordination (juxtaposed clauses with one intonation contour and sharing of conjugational categories such as tense) and subordination. The most common type of subordination is the purposive.

If there are shared arguments, they are more likely to be deleted from the second clause if it is subordinate, and least likely if it is sentence-sequence. The restrictions on the syntactic function of the shared argument are typical of syntactically ergative languages. The shared argument has to have the same function in both clauses, or be an intransitive subject (S) in one and a transitive patient-like argument (O) in the other:
In case the shared argument is a transitive agent-like argument (A) in one of the clauses, antipassivisation will be involved. It is signalled by a verbal suffix and affects the case marking of the arguments of this verb. In comparison with the basic verb, which marks the A with ergative/nominative and the O with nominative/accusative, the antipassivised verb marks the A with nominative and the O with either ergative or dative. The agent-like argument then becomes available to be coreferential with a patient of a transitive verb or a subject of an intransitive one:

<doc id="714366" wikidata="Q2693233" url="?curid=714366" title="Internal consistency">
<text>In statistics and research, internal consistency is typically a measure based on the correlations between different items on the same test (or the same subscale on a larger test). It measures whether several items that propose to measure the same general construct produce similar scores. For example, if a respondent expressed agreement with the statements &quot;I like to ride bicycles&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve enjoyed riding bicycles in the past&quot;, and disagreement with the statement &quot;I hate bicycles&quot;, this would be indicative of good internal consistency of the test.

==Cronbach&#x27;s alpha==

Internal consistency is usually measured with Cronbach&#x27;s alpha, a statistic calculated from the pairwise correlations between items. Internal consistency ranges between negative infinity and one. Coefficient alpha will be negative whenever there is greater within-subject variability than between-subject variability.

A commonly accepted rule of thumb for describing internal consistency is as follows:
Very high reliabilities (0.95 or higher) are not necessarily desirable, as this indicates that the items may be redundant. The goal in designing a reliable instrument is for scores on similar items to be related (internally consistent), but for each to contribute some unique information as well. Note further that Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is necessarily higher for tests measuring more narrow constructs, and lower when more generic, broad constructs are measured. This phenomenon, along with a number of other reasons, argue against using objective cut-off values for internal consistency measures. Alpha is also a function of the number of items, so shorter scales will often have lower reliability estimates yet still be preferable in many situations because they are lower burden.

An alternative way of thinking about internal consistency is that it is the extent to which all of the items of a test measure the same latent variable. The advantage of this perspective over the notion of a high average correlation among the items of a test – the perspective underlying Cronbach&#x27;s alpha – is that the average item correlation is affected by skewness (in the distribution of item correlations) just as any other average is. Thus, whereas the modal item correlation is zero when the items of a test measure several unrelated latent variables, the average item correlation in such cases will be greater than zero. Thus, whereas the ideal of measurement is for all items of a test to measure the same latent variable, alpha has been demonstrated many times to attain quite high values even when the set of items measures several unrelated latent variables.
The hierarchical &quot;coefficient omega&quot; may be a more appropriate index of the extent to which all of the items in a test measure the same latent variable. Several different measures of internal consistency are reviewed by Revelle &amp; Zinbarg (2009).

<doc id="714369" wikidata="Q715681" url="?curid=714369" title="Henry Hamilton (colonial administrator)">
<text>Henry Hamilton ( – 29 September 1796) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. He served in North America as Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec and later as Deputy Governor after the American Revolutionary War. He later served as Governor of Bermuda and lastly, as Governor of Dominica, where he died in office.

In 1779, Hamilton was captured during the Revolutionary War by American forces at Fort Sackville while serving as the Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit. He was transported to Virginia, where Hamilton was held by Governor Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s government until October 1780. He was then sent to New York and gained freedom in a prisoner exchange in 1781, being allowed to depart for London.

==Early life==
Henry Hamilton was born in Dublin, Ireland, a younger son of Henry Hamilton, an Irish Member of Parliament, and his wife.

Hamilton was raised in County Cork, Ireland. His older brother Sackville Hamilton later served as a Privy Councillor and Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. His direct paternal great-great-grandfather was Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley.

==Military career==

As was typical of younger sons of the Protestant Ascendancy, Henry Hamilton entered the British Army. During the French and Indian War in North America, part of the Seven Years&#x27; War between Britain and France, he served as a Captain in the 15th Regiment of Foot. They fought in the 1758 attack on Louisbourg and the Battle of Quebec. He was captured at Sainte-Foy in 1760, but a French officer switched coats with him to ease his apprehensions about Native Americans killing British officers.

With the support of Governor General of British North America Guy Carleton, Hamilton rose to the rank of brigade major. In 1775, he sold his commission, leaving the Army for a political career.

==American Revolutionary War==

===Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit===
In 1775, Henry Hamilton was appointed as Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit, Province of Quebec (it then extended from the Atlantic to this area), British North America. (The fort site is now within the borders of Detroit, Michigan).

This was one of five newly created lieutenant governorships in the recently expanded eastern territory of Canada. When Governor Hamilton reached his base at Fort Detroit to assume his government duties in the Great Lakes region, the American Revolutionary War was already underway. Hamilton was in a difficult position: as a civil official, he had few British Army regulars at his command, and the loyalty of local Canadians and Indians was far from assured. Normand Macleod, a local fur trader and army officer, acted as the temporary &quot;town major&quot;, a British government official in command of a fortified town, before Hamilton&#x27;s arrival.

===British war policies on the western frontier===

Governor Henry Hamilton became adept at diplomacy with the Indians, establishing good relations with local Indian leaders of the Huron and Odawa tribes. An amateur artist, Hamilton also sketched portraits of many Indians while in Detroit, leaving what has been called the &quot;earliest and largest collection of life portraits of Native Americans of the Upper Great Lakes.&quot; This is now held by Houghton Library at Harvard University.

At the beginning of the war, British policy encouraged neutrality among the Indians leaders. But in 1777 Hamilton received instructions to encourage Indian raids against American frontier settlements in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky. Hamilton responded to Lord Germain, &quot;Would to God this storm which is ready to fall on the Frontiers could be directed upon the guilty heads of those wretches who have raised it, and pass by the miserable many who must feel its fatal effects.&quot;

This was a controversial policy, because he and other British officials realised that Loyalists would inevitably be killed in these raids. Hamilton tried to limit civilian casualties by sending British Army regulars and Canadian militia alongside Indian raiding parties. Despite this, Indian warriors carried out their own customs during the raids, resulting in hundreds of women and children in Kentucky and western Pennsylvania being killed and scalped during the war. This, as feared, led to an increase in anti-British sentiment in the region. According to an early 20th-century local history, Americans on the frontier accused Hamilton of paying bounties for prisoners and scalps brought in by the Indian warriors, calling him the &quot;Hair-buyer General&quot;. Hamilton denied ever paying Indians for scalps. He did, however, accept scalps as evidence of success, for which Indian war parties were rewarded with additional supplies.

===George Rogers Clark and Illinois Regiment, Virginia state forces in the Illinois Country===
In 1778, Patriot Colonel George Rogers Clark, commanding Virginia state forces, captured several undermanned British posts in the Illinois Country, including Fort Sackville at Vincennes (then in Virginia-claimed land, now in present-day Indiana). Hamilton led an armed party from Detroit on 7 October 1778 to recapture the British post, 600 miles away. His small force gathered Indian warriors along the way, and entered Vincennes on 17 December 1778. They captured Fort Sackville and the American commandant, Captain Leonard Helm. In February 1779, however, Colonel Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise march, recapturing the outpost and taking Hamilton prisoner.

===Defeat and prisoner in Virginia===
In early March, General George Rogers Clark ordered Hamilton to be taken to the Virginia state capital in Williamsburg as a prisoner of war. Poor travel conditions on the Ohio River forced the group—led by Captain Williams and Lieutenant Rogers—to travel most of the way by foot through the Moccasin Gap between what is now Kentucky and Virginia, finally arriving in Williamsburg in the middle of June. Once in Virginia&#x27;s capital, he was jailed and placed in irons by order of Governor Thomas Jefferson and the Virginia Executive Council. Hamilton was held from 16 June – 29 September 1779. Hamilton rejected an offer of parole on the grounds that the terms violated his freedom of speech in restraining him from &quot;saying anything to the prejudice of the United States.&quot; Jefferson refused to treat Hamilton and other British prisoners as prisoners-of-war and handled them as he would have handled escaped slaves: putting them in irons for 18 months in Williamsburg and Chesterfield. Governor Jefferson eventually dropped charges of scalp-buying, but did not release Hamilton until October 1780, and only after George Washington during several months had entreated him to accept his parole. Hamilton was sent to New York to await a prisoner exchange. This took place in March 1781. He immediately sailed to London, England on a British ship.

==Later career as British royal governor==
Henry Hamilton was reassigned to Canada in 1782 under an appointment as Lieutenant-Governor, and later Deputy-Governor of the Province of Quebec. He administered during the transition in the postwar years as the Crown granted thousands of acres of land, mostly in what became Upper Canada, to Loyalists as compensation for their losses in the former Thirteen Colonies and as payment to soldiers.

After a few years, Hamilton was reassigned as royal Governor of Bermuda, serving from 1785 to 1794. He then departed Bermuda on HMS Scorpion (stopping enroute at Antigua on 4 December 1794) to serve as Governor of Dominica, the present-day Commonwealth of Dominica, from 1794 until his death in office in 1796. In March 1795, at age 61, Hamilton married 25-year-old Elizabeth Lee from Banbury, Oxfordshire, a daughter of Colonel Lee. The Hamiltons had one daughter together, Mary Anne Pierpoint Hamilton. She died in 1871, unmarried and without children.

==Death==
Hamilton died in office on the island of Antigua, British North America, now Antigua and Barbuda, on 29 September 1796.

Among his papers, Hamilton had kept a journal from 1778 to 1779 as Lieutenant Governor at Fort Detroit during the American Revolution; this was published for the first time posthumously in 1951 in a history that addressed his and George Rogers Clark&#x27;s roles in the war.

==In popular culture==

US author Winston Churchill wrote an epic historical novel in 1904 called &quot;The Crossing&quot; covering a man&#x27;s life in the old Northwest from the Revolution to the Burr Conspiracy. The first part is about the protagonist marching as a drummer boy with George Rogers Clark and the highlight is the capture of Vincennes from Hamilton. There is much information about Hamilton&#x27;s activities and his reputation among the local backwoodsmen, based on research from original documents.

<text>A state funeral is a public funeral ceremony, observing the strict rules of protocol, held to honour people of national significance. State funerals usually include much pomp and ceremony as well as religious overtones and distinctive elements of military tradition. Generally, state funerals are held in order to involve the general public in a national day of mourning after the family of the deceased gives consent. A state funeral will often generate mass publicity from both national and global media outlets.

== History ==
State funerals already existed in antiquity. In ancient Athens, for example, fallen soldiers were regularly buried in a public ceremony. In the Roman Empire, a state funeral (&quot;funera publica&quot;) could be instructed by the senate for the city of Rome, whereas city councils could instruct a communal state funeral.

=== Canada ===
=== India ===
On 17 November 2012, Bal Thackeray was accorded a state funeral in the city of Mumbai. On 10 October 2024, businessman Ratan Tata was given a state funeral in Mumbai. Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh was given a State funeral on 28 December 2024.

=== Italy ===

In Italy state funerals are granted by law to the Presidents of the constitutional entities, such as the Presidency, the Parliament, the Government and the Constitutional Court, even after their terms have expired, and to Ministers who died during their term in office. State Funerals can also be granted, by decree of the Council of Ministers, to people who gave particular services to the country; to citizens that brought honor to the nation; or to citizens who died in the line of duty, or were victims of either terrorism, or organized crime.

The official protocol provides for

* the coffin surrounded by six members in high uniform of either the Carabinieri or the same Armed Forces the departed belonged to;
* an honor guard to the coffin at the entrance and the exit of the place in which the ceremony is held;
* the presence of one representative of the Government;
* an official commemorative oration;
* other honors that can be arranged by the Prime Minister.

Public mourning, either national or local, is declared following the dispositions of the Prime Minister&#x27;s decrees. The flags are flown at half-mast outside of public buildings, while inside they display two black ribbons, with the exceptions provided for military flags, when required by military protocol.

If the departed held a public office, the body can lie in state in the building of the office&#x27;s institution. In other cases it is followed the will of the family, the traditions of the office or the local customs.

Outside of the cases provided for by the protocol, for example during natural events that deeply impact the community, solemn funerals can be arranged and the six people who carry the coffins are members of the Civil Protection.

<text>DMG Media (stylised in lowercase) is an intermediate holding company for Associated Newspapers, Northcliffe Media, Harmsworth Printing, Harmsworth Media and other subsidiaries of Daily Mail and General Trust. It is based at 9 Derry Street in Kensington, West London.

Associated Newspapers Limited was established in 1905 and owns the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, MailOnline, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Metro&quot;, Metro.co.uk, &quot;i&quot; newspaper, inews.co.uk and &quot;New Scientist&quot;. Its portfolio of national newspapers, websites and mobile and tablet applications regularly reach 63% of the British adult population every month: it includes two major paid-for national newspaper titles as well as a free nationally available newspaper. The firm is also responsible for overseeing and developing the Group&#x27;s online consumer businesses and for the group&#x27;s UK newspaper printing operations.

Harmsworth Printing Limited produces all of its London, Southern England and South Wales editions of the national titles out of a print work site in Thurrock, Essex. In 2020 DMG Media acquired JPI Media&#x27;s print operations in Dinnington, Portsmouth and Carn.

== History ==
Associated Newspaper Ltd was established in 1905 by brother newspaper barons Alfred and Harold Harmsworth. When Alfred died in 1922 without an heir, Harold Harmsworth acquired his controlling interest in Associated Newspapers for £1.6 million, and the next year bought the Hulton newspaper chain, which left Associated Newspapers in control of three national morning newspapers, three national Sunday newspapers, two London evening papers, four provincial daily newspapers, and three provincial Sunday newspapers.

Harold retired as chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1932 at the age of 64, and his son Esmond took over that role. He served as chairman until 1971, after which he assumed the titles of President and Director of Group Finance, and chairman of Daily Mail &amp; General Trust Ltd, the parent company, from 1938 until his death. Harmsworth ran the businesses with sufficient skill that they remain firmly under family control today, majority ownership being voted by his grandson, Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere (and a significant minority by Vyvyan Harmsworth, the 2nd Viscount&#x27;s son by his third marriage). Jonathan Harmsworth is the chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT). Associated Newspapers changed its name to DMG Media in 2013.

In January 2022, DMGT delisted from the London Stock Exchange following a successful offer for DMGT by Rothermere Continuation Limited.

=== Associated-Rediffusion ===
In February 1954, with the passage of the Television Act 1954, Associated Newspapers joined forces with Taylorfilms and Rediffusion (the latter being a division of BET plc) into forming Associated-Rediffusion, winning the rights for London&#x27;s weekday ITV service. They began broadcasting on 22 September 1955. During the partnership&#x27;s first year, Associated-Rediffusion was losing money so fast that it was financially suffering; However, Associated-Rediffusion had managed to recover its financial security completely by October 1958. However, Associated-Rediffusion eventually lost its rights into broadcasting within London during August 1967.

==Legal action==
On 27 April 2007, Associated Newspapers was ordered to pay undisclosed damages to Hugh Grant. He sued over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; on 18, 21 and 24 February. Grant&#x27;s lawyer stated that all of the articles&#x27; &quot;allegations and factual assertions are false.&quot;

In a written statement, Grant said he took the action because: &quot;I was tired of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain. I&#x27;m also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called &#x27;close friends&#x27; or &#x27;close sources&#x27; on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist.&quot;

The publisher has also lost libel cases and paid damages to personalities including television presenter Thea Rogers, and Oisin Fanning, former CEO of Smart Telecom.

On 1 October 2019, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex announced via a statement that his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex is suing Associated Newspapers over a private letter one of its newspapers, &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, had published. The handwritten letter, which Markle addressed to her father, Thomas Markle, was published by the paper in February 2019. The statement claims that the paper misused private information, copyright infringement and breached the UK&#x27;s Data Protection Act 2018. Furthermore, the Duke and Duchess alleges the letter was published illegally and edited selectively to hide &quot;lies&quot; the paper had told about the Duchess. Prince Harry added that the legal action &quot;hinges on one incident in a long and disturbing pattern of behavior&quot; against his wife by British tabloid media.

Associated Newspapers was ordered to pay damages of £120,000 and published two apologies, in April and May 2019, to a charitable organisation for wrongly claiming links to terrorism.

On 24 February 2022, a spokesperson for Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex confirmed he had begun libel action against Associated Newspapers Ltd. The claim related to an article printed in The Mail on Sunday about his security arrangements.

On 6 October 2022, it was announced that various individuals, including Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, Elton John and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, were taking legal action against Associated Newspapers Ltd. The action relates to allegations of &quot;gross breaches of privacy&quot;, including phone hacking and the use of listening devices placed in homes and cars.

<doc id="714373" wikidata="Q667613" url="?curid=714373" title="Daily Mail and General Trust">
<text>Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) is a British multinational media conglomerate, the owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and several other titles. The 4th Viscount Rothermere is the chair and controlling shareholder of the company. The head office is located in Northcliffe House in Kensington, London. In January 2022, DMGT delisted from the London Stock Exchange following a successful offer for DMGT by Rothermere Continuation Limited.

==History==
The group traces its origins to the launch in 1896 of the mid-market national newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; by Harold Harmsworth (later created, in July 1919, The 1st Viscount Rothermere) and his elder brother, Alfred. It was incorporated in 1922 and its shares were first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1932. 

The 1st Viscount Rothermere&#x27;s son, Esmond, took operational control of the organization in 1932 and complete control in November 1940, when his father died.

Vere Harmsworth became the Chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1970. Upon the death of his father in July 1978, he succeeded as The 3rd Viscount Rothermere and became chair of parent Daily Mail and General Trust plc.

After almost 100 years in Fleet Street, the company left its original premises of New Carmelite House in Fleet Street in 1988 to move to Northcliffe House in Kensington.

In 2019, DMGT joined the Belt and Road News Network.

In 2023, DMGT invested in Hexagon Cup, a Madrid-based padel competition.

==Divisions==

<doc id="714375" wikidata="Q96378538" url="?curid=714375" title="Freeserve">
<text>Freeserve was a British Internet service provider, which was founded in 1998. At its height, the company became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, before merging into the Wanadoo group in 2001. It then became a subsidiary of France Telecom, who owned a controlling interest in Wanadoo. Wanadoo rebranded over time and eventually became Orange Home UK.

Since the merger of Orange UK into EE, Orange Home UK was integrated as a service within EE&#x27;s range of services.

==History==
The company was founded in 1998 as a project between Dixons Group plc and Leeds-based hosting provider Planet Online to provide free Internet access to customers buying new home PCs from Dixons stores. The concept was the brainchild of Ajaz Ahmed BEM who was an employee at Dixons at the time. He grew frustrated of not being able to get online without technical know-how and so sought about a better way for PC owners to get online.
Initially the concept was called Channel 6 and was between Packard Bell and Planet Online. Packard Bell pulled out and Dixons (who resold their PCs) stepped in as joint partner.

Freeserve was one of the first of the UK&#x27;s ISPs to dispense with the usual monthly subscription fee for Internet access, and instead to collect a proportion of the standard telephone line charges. This made it more appealing and affordable to the masses and paved way for more people gaining internet access in the UK. (At the time virtually all Internet access in the UK was by dial-up access via BT lines.) With Freeserve however each customer had 10 megabytes of webspace, and could split the email address into as many names as desired, using a simple extension of the normal email naming protocols (&quot;user@freeserve.co.uk&quot; could subdivide into email for &quot;dad@user.freeserve.co.uk&quot; and &quot;mum@user.freeserve.co.uk&quot; etc.).

At the time, not having a standing charge for such a comprehensive service, especially the webspace, was a radical step. Further revenue was obtained from advertisements on Freeserve&#x27;s homepage, which was set as the default page in the customers&#x27; web browsers upon installing the Freeserve connection software. BT sought to challenge Freeserve&#x27;s business plan by arguing that under the regulatory model (known as Number Translation Services, or NTS), it should receive more money for each call, and in January 1999 Oftel announced that it would carry out a review.

Freeserve floated on the stock market in July 1999 (as Freeserve.com plc), at which point it had approximately 1.3 million subscribers and was valued at between £1.31 billion and £1.51 billion.

By September 2000, Freeserve had more than two million active subscribers. This was vastly more than the incumbent telephone provider BT, something that was unique for a European ISP.

Freeserve was bought by the France Télécom-owned company Wanadoo in 2000 for £1.65 billion.

Freeserve began to trial the emerging ADSL broadband service in early 2000. The original equipment supplied was a rack-type hard-wired modem and a separate router. A year later, the supplied end-user equipment was just a small USB-based modem, the Thomson SpeedTouch 330 (previously known as the Speedtouch USB). Later, as Orange, they supplied a wireless ADSL modem router, the Orange-badged Siemens SE572, with one Ethernet port.

==Successive rebrandings==
After being bought by Wanadoo in 2001, Freeserve first had its name changed to Wanadoo UK plc on 28 April 2004. Following a new rebranding exercise in June 2006, Freeserve and Wanadoo UK then formed part of the UK operation of Orange, and were known as Orange Home UK plc. In 2010 Orange UK and T-Mobile UK merged to form EE which was a joint venture between Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom. Orange&#x27;s broadband service was then rebranded as EE Broadband on 30 October 2012.

==Deactivation==
In August 2007, Orange started a process to purge unused Freeserve accounts from its system.

Originally Freeserve accounts would be deactivated after ninety days if the dial-up number was not accessed (hence not generating any revenue for Orange). Customers would then receive an error message when trying to access their Freeserve email via another connection, but could reactivate the account before it was deleted by visiting the Orange website.

Orange extended the deactivation period to 260 days in 2007 but under the new regime users&#x27; accounts and all email were deleted permanently from Orange&#x27;s servers after a 30-day warning was issued.

The account deactivation process ceased on 28 February 2012.

In 2016 the service hosting the original Freeserve personal webspace was deactivated, ending the anomaly of orphaned pages that could not be edited, the dial-up service allowing editing having ceased some years before.

In early 2017 all email users were advised that the email service was also withdrawn.

<doc id="714376" wikidata="Q56002" url="?curid=714376" title="Ventricular tachycardia">
<text>Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a cardiovascular disorder in which fast heart rate occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased level of consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to coma and persistent vegetative state due to lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and turn into cardiac arrest. This conversion of the VT into VF is called the degeneration of the VT. It is found initially in about 7% of people in cardiac arrest.
Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to coronary heart disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte imbalance, or a heart attack. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a rate of greater than 120 beats per minute and at least three wide QRS complexes in a row. It is classified as non-sustained versus sustained based on whether it lasts less than or more than 30 seconds. The term ventricular arrhythmia refers to the group of abnormal cardiac rhythms originating from the ventricle, which includes ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes.
In those who have normal blood pressure and strong pulse, the antiarrhythmic medication procainamide may be used. Otherwise, immediate cardioversion is recommended, preferably with a biphasic DC shock of 200 joules. In those in cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation is recommended. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. While waiting for a defibrillator, a precordial thump may be attempted (by those who have experience) in those on a heart monitor who are seen going into an unstable ventricular tachycardia. In those with cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia, survival is about 75%. An implantable cardiac defibrillator or medications such as calcium channel blockers or amiodarone may be used to prevent recurrence.

==Signs and symptoms==
While a few seconds may not result in problems, longer periods are dangerous. Short periods may occur without symptoms or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, or unconsciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may turn into ventricular fibrillation and can result in cardiac arrest.

==Cause==
Ventricular tachycardia can occur due to coronary heart disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte problems (e.g., low blood levels of magnesium or potassium), inherited channelopathies (e.g., long-QT syndrome), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome (typically following atrial fibrillation), or a myocardial infarction.

==Pathophysiology==

The morphology of the tachycardia depends on its cause and the origin of the re-entry electrical circuit in the heart.

In monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, the shape of each heart beat on the ECG looks the same because the impulse is either being generated from increased automaticity of a single point in either the left or the right ventricle, or due to a reentry circuit within the ventricle. The most common cause of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is scarring of the heart muscle from a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack). This scar cannot conduct electrical activity, so there is a potential circuit &quot;around&quot; the scar that results in the tachycardia. This is similar to the re-entrant circuits that are the cause of atrial flutter and the re-entrant forms of supraventricular tachycardia. Other rarer congenital causes of monomorphic VT include right ventricular dysplasia, and right and left ventricular outflow tract VT.

Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, is most commonly caused by abnormalities of ventricular muscle repolarization. The predisposition to this problem usually manifests on the ECG as a prolongation of the QT interval. QT prolongation may be congenital or acquired. Congenital problems include long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Acquired problems are usually related to drug toxicity or electrolyte abnormalities, but can occur as a result of myocardial ischemia. Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs such as sotalol and amiodarone prolong the QT interval and may in some circumstances be pro-arrhythmic. Other relatively common drugs including some antibiotics and antihistamines may also be a danger, in particular in combination with one another. Problems with blood levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium may also contribute. High-dose magnesium is often used as an antidote in cardiac arrest protocols.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia is made based on the rhythm seen on either a 12-lead ECG or a telemetry rhythm strip. It may be very difficult to differentiate between ventricular tachycardia and wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia in some cases. In particular, supraventricular tachycardias with aberrant conduction from a pre-existing bundle branch block are commonly misdiagnosed as ventricular tachycardia. Other rarer phenomena include Ashman beats and antidromic atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias.

Various diagnostic criteria have been developed to determine whether a wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia or a more benign rhythm. In addition to these diagnostic criteria, if the individual has a history of a myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or recent angina, the wide complex tachycardia is much more likely to be ventricular tachycardia.

The proper diagnosis is important, as the misdiagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia when ventricular tachycardia is present is associated with worse prognosis. This is particularly true if calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, are used to attempt to terminate a presumed supraventricular tachycardia. Therefore, it is wisest to assume that all wide complex tachycardia is VT until proven otherwise.

ECG features of ventricular tachycardia, in addition to the increased heart rate, are:

# A wide QRS complex (because the ectopics for the generation of the cardiac impulse originate in the ventricular myocyte and are propagated via the intermyocyte conduction, which is a delayed conduction)
# A Josephson&#x27;s sign where there is the notch in the downsloping of the S wave near its nadir (considered very specific for the VT)
# Capture beats (normal QRS complex in between when the heart picks up the sinus rhythm from the impulses generated by the SA node), fusion beats (due to the fusion of the abnormal and the normal QRS complexes), which has a unique morphology
# Positive or negative concordance
# Extreme axis deviation or northwest axis (axis between -90 and +180 degrees)

===Classification===

Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its &quot;morphology&quot;:
* Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG).
** Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a heart attack, especially if they have weak heart muscle.
** Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG.
** The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum.
* Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name &quot;torsades de pointes&quot; (&quot;twisting of the spikes&quot;). However, at the current time, the term &quot;torsades de pointes&quot; is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval.

Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the &quot;duration of the episodes&quot;: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia.
* If the fast rhythm self-terminates within 30 seconds, it is considered a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
* If the rhythm lasts more than 30 seconds, it is known as a sustained ventricular tachycardia (even if it terminates on its own after 30 seconds).

A third way to classify ventricular tachycardia is on the basis of its &quot;symptoms&quot;: Pulseless VT is associated with no effective cardiac output, hence, no effective pulse, and is a cause of cardiac arrest (see also: pulseless electrical activity [PEA]). In this circumstance, it is best treated the same way as ventricular fibrillation (VF), and is recognized as one of the shockable rhythms on the cardiac arrest protocol. Some VT is associated with reasonable cardiac output and may even be asymptomatic. The heart usually tolerates this rhythm poorly in the medium to long term, and patients may certainly deteriorate to pulseless VT or to VF.

Occasionally in ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular impulses are conducted to the ventricles, generating QRS complexes with normal or aberrant supraventricular morphology (ventricular capture). Or, those impulses can be merged with complexes that are originated in the ventricle and produce a summation pattern (fusion complexes).

Less common is ventricular tachycardia that occurs in individuals with structurally normal hearts. This is known as &quot;idiopathic ventricular tachycardia&quot; and in the monomorphic form coincides with little or no increased risk of sudden cardiac death. In general, &quot;idiopathic ventricular tachycardia&quot; occurs in younger individuals diagnosed with VT. While the causes of idiopathic VT are not known, in general it is presumed to be congenital, and can be brought on by any number of diverse factors.

==Treatment==
Therapy may be directed either at terminating an episode of the abnormal heart rhythm or at reducing the risk of another VT episode. The treatment for stable VT is tailored to the specific person, with regard to how well the individual tolerates episodes of ventricular tachycardia, how frequently episodes occur, their comorbidities, and their wishes. Individuals with pulseless VT or unstable VT are hemodynamically compromised and require immediate electric cardioversion to shock them out of the VT rhythm.

===Cardioversion===
If a person still has a pulse, it is usually possible to terminate the episode using electric cardioversion. This should be synchronized to the heartbeat if the waveform is monomorphic if possible, in order to avoid degeneration of the rhythm to ventricular fibrillation. An initial energy of 100J is recommended. If the waveform is polymorphic, then higher energies and an unsynchronized shock should be provided (also known as defibrillation).

===Defibrillation===
A person with pulseless VT is treated the same as ventricular fibrillation with high-energy (360J with a monophasic defibrillator, or 200J with a biphasic defibrillator) unsynchronised cardioversion (defibrillation). They will be unconscious.

The shock may be delivered to the outside of the chest using the two pads of an external defibrillator, or internally to the heart by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if one has previously been inserted.

An ICD may also be set to attempt to overdrive pace the ventricle. Pacing the ventricle at a rate faster than the underlying tachycardia can sometimes be effective in terminating the rhythm. If this fails after a short trial, the ICD will usually stop pacing, charge up and deliver a defibrillation grade shock.

===Medication===
For those who are stable with a monomorphic waveform the medications procainamide or sotalol may be used and are better than lidocaine. Evidence does not show that amiodarone is better than procainamide.

As a low magnesium level in the blood is a common cause of VT, magnesium sulfate can be given for torsades de pointes or if a low blood magnesium level is found/suspected.

Long-term anti-arrhythmic therapy may be indicated to prevent recurrence of VT. Beta-blockers and a number of class III anti-arrhythmics are commonly used, such as the beta-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol, and bisoprolol, and the Potassium-Channel-Blockers amiodarone, dronedarone, bretylium, sotalol, ibutilide, and dofetilide. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists are also sometimes used in this setting.

===Invasive treatment===
An ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) is more effective than drug therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death due to VT and VF, but does not prevent these rhythms from happening.

Catheter ablation is a potentially definitive treatment option for those with recurrent VT. Remote magnetic navigation is one effective method to do the procedure.

In the past, ablation was often not considered until pharmacological options had been exhausted, often after the patient had developed substantial morbidity from recurrent episodes of VT and ICD shocks. Antiarrhythmic medications can reduce the frequency of ICD therapies, but have efficacy varies and side effects can be significant. Advances in technology and understanding of VT substrates now allow ablation of multiple and unstable VTs with acceptable safety and efficacy, even in patients with advanced heart disease.

<text>David Lombardo (born February 16, 1965) is a Cuban-American drummer, best known as a co-founding member of the thrash metal band Slayer. He currently plays drums with Fantômas, Dead Cross, Mr. Bungle, Empire State Bastard, and Misfits.

Lombardo previously played drums on nine Slayer albums, including &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; (1986) and &quot;Christ Illusion&quot; (2006). His music career has spanned over 40 years, during which he has been involved in the production of 35 commercial recordings covering a number of genres. He has performed with numerous other bands, including Grip Inc., Philm and Fantômas, in addition to Slayer.

Lombardo is widely known as an aggressive heavy metal drummer. His drumming has been praised as &quot;astonishingly innovative&quot;. &quot;Drummerworld&quot; named him &quot;The Godfather of Double Bass&quot;. He has had a significant influence on the metal scene and inspired modern metal drummers, particularly extreme metal drummers.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Lombardo was born in Havana, Cuba, on February 16, 1965, where his father owned three meat markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHILM/EX-SLAYER CUBA, - I DEMOCRACY, VIOLENCE&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is of Italian descent through his paternal great-grandfather, who relocated to Cuba in the 19th century. Lombardo moved with his family to South Gate, California, when he was two years old, and still speaks Spanish. He has two older brothers and an older sister; his brothers had previously emigrated to the US via Operation Peter Pan.

His musical interests were fueled by his first musical performance when he was eight years old; he played bongos to Santana&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Everything&quot;. Lombardo joined his school&#x27;s band and played the marching drum. After noticing his son&#x27;s persistent interest in music, Lombardo&#x27;s father bought him a five-piece Pearl Maxwin drum set for $350 when Lombardo was ten years old. Lombardo bought his first record, &quot;Alive!&quot; by Kiss, to play along with. He learned to play Kiss&#x27; &quot;100,000 Years&quot; by repeatedly listening to the record until he could play the drum solo perfectly.

Lombardo asked his parents for drum lessons. Although they agreed, the lessons were short-lived. Lombardo grew bored because the lessons were repetitive and did not challenge him. Lombardo&#x27;s friends introduced him to disco, which appealed to his affinity for funk, Latin and soul. He became a temporary DJ for a mobile disc jockey under the name A Touch of Class. Unimpressed with their son coming home at 4:00 am, Lombardo&#x27;s parents pressured him into quitting the DJ gig or face military school.

Lombardo returned to playing rock music in 1978 and befriended several like-minded musicians around South Gate. Lombardo attended Pius X High School. He performed Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; with a guitarist named Peter Fashing during the school&#x27;s talent show. &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the roar of the crowd during the drum solo. We brought the house down,&quot; said Lombardo, who became known as &quot;David the Drummer&quot; the following day. Lombardo soon formed a band named Escape with two guitarists. Lombardo found a vocalist to join the band after he transferred to South Gate High School in 1979. The band performed at several events under the name Sabotage, but the band was short-lived.

Lombardo&#x27;s parents convinced him to quit the band because he was withdrawing from everything except music. Knowing her son was set on pursuing a life on the stage, Lombardo&#x27;s mother asked him to at least graduate high school. He honored her wish and graduated from South Gate High School in June 1983. Immediately following, Lombardo was recommended by his technical drafting teacher to Diesel Energy Systems Company. Impressed with his skill, Lombardo was hired on the spot. Around this time, Lombardo&#x27;s musical career was ready to take off.

==Musical career==
===Slayer===
When he was 16, Lombardo&#x27;s friends told him about a guitar player, Kerry King, who lived a few blocks away. Lombardo dropped by King&#x27;s house to meet him. Lombardo introduced himself, mentioned he played drums, and shared that he wanted to start a band. King jammed with Lombardo and later showed Lombardo his guitar collection. The two quickly realized they shared some of the same musical interests. After rehearsing in Lombardo&#x27;s garage several times, King introduced the drummer to another guitarist named Jeff Hanneman. The three rehearsed several times before they decided they needed a singer and bass player. King had previously played with Tom Araya in a band called Quits and decided to introduce Araya to Lombardo and Hanneman.

With Slayer&#x27;s line-up now complete, Lombardo stabbed out the now iconic logo and the band began to develop their groundbreaking sound. Slayer recorded their debut album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; soon after. Lombardo enlisted producer Rick Rubin for their third album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; (1986). Lombardo left the band during their tour to promote &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, stating, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.&quot; Tony Scaglione of Whiplash was enlisted to replace Lombardo. Unhappy with the change, Rick Rubin repeatedly called Lombardo asking his return. Lombardo initially refused before eventually returning to the band in 1987.

Lombardo recorded drums on the Slayer albums &quot;South of Heaven&quot; (1988) and &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot; (1990). He left the band again in 1992. Lombardo left Slayer because he wanted to be present for his first child&#x27;s birth. Lombardo told his bandmates at the beginning of the pregnancy, stating he would be unable to tour the last two weeks of September. He got a phone call from Slayer&#x27;s manager, Rick Sales, stating that they were booking a festival in September. Lombardo, however, was firm in his decision and insisted he would not miss his child&#x27;s birth.

Ten years after leaving Slayer, Lombardo got a phone call from the band in 2001, asking if he would like to perform a few shows. Hanneman was eager for Dave to return, but King was less enthusiastic. King thought Lombardo was not up to snuff, but was &quot;blown away&quot; by Lombardo&#x27;s performance in rehearsals. King later said, &quot;He&#x27;s got the feet and he&#x27;s got the hands, he&#x27;s not missing a step.&quot;

Lombardo decided to resume drumming duties. His first show was at Toad&#x27;s Place in New Haven, Connecticut on January 24, 2002. At the beginning of the band&#x27;s show at The 7 Flags Event Center near Des Moines, Iowa on February 2, 2002, Araya welcomed Lombardo&#x27;s return and dedicated the show to Exodus vocalist Paul Baloff, who had died earlier that day. Lombardo toured with Slayer as part of Ozzfest, H82k2, Summer Tour, and the 2004 Download Festival. While preparing for the Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was hospitalized for a mysterious illness. Metallica rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers to replace Ulrich; Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, Flemming Larsen (Ulrich&#x27;s drum technician) and Lombardo volunteered. Lombardo performed the songs &quot;Battery&quot; and &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, while Jordison and Larsen performed the rest of the songs.

Lombardo recorded drums on Slayer&#x27;s 2006 release &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;, promoting the album on The Unholy Alliance tour. King said Lombardo was a major attraction for the fans, and one of the reasons for their surge in popularity. King and other band members preferred Lombardo on drums. Araya said, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of right back where we started. He&#x27;s an amazing performer. We took off right where we left off, you know? It&#x27;s like he was never gone. He&#x27;s working with Kerry on his tunes. He&#x27;s helped out a lot actually!&quot;

&quot;Christ Illusion&quot; received generally favorable reviews with critics praising Lombardo&#x27;s return. Chris Steffen of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Christ Illusion&quot; is &quot;God Hates Us All&quot; without the memorable riffs, at least their awesome drummer Dave Lombardo shows off some chops, particularly on the raging &#x27;Supremist.&#x27;&quot; Don Kaye of &quot;Blabbermouth&quot; gave the album a favorable review and praised Lombardo. Kaye wrote, &quot;One thing&#x27;s for sure: Lombardo&#x27;s influence on this band is absolutely undeniable. He is simply essential to the Slayer sound. He is one of metal&#x27;s all-around best drummers, perhaps the very best in the field of thrash/speed metal, and his power, style, and chops – not to mention his intangible chemistry with the rest of the group and those amazing flying feet – bring Slayer&#x27;s overall performance, intensity and music to a higher level.&quot;

Lombardo recorded another album with Slayer in 2009, titled &quot;World Painted Blood&quot;.

He left the band once again in February 2013 shortly before the band was scheduled to play Australia&#x27;s Soundwave festival, due to further contract and pay disputes with band members.

Slayer&#x27;s final concert was held on November 30, 2019. Lombardo stated that he had no interest in attending their final performances because he was busy with his own musical projects.

In 2022, he listed &quot;Captor of Sin&quot;, &quot;Ghosts of War&quot;, and &quot;Beauty Through Order&quot; as his favorite Slayer songs.

===Grip Inc.===
After the birth of his first child in 1993, Lombardo formed Grip Inc. with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta. The pair recruited bassist Jason VieBrooks and vocalist Gus Chambers to complete the line-up. An early five-piece line-up briefly featured former Overkill guitarist Bobby Gustafson who claims to have come up with the name Grip which Lombardo expanded to Grip Inc. after Gustafson&#x27;s departure in order to avoid a potential lawsuit. Grip Inc.&#x27;s debut record was released in 1995. The album, titled Power of Inner Strength, was distributed via California-based label Metal Blade Records. AllMusic reviewer Vincent Jeffries singled out Lombardo for praise on the album, saying Slayer fans would &quot;enjoy the drummer&#x27;s double bass work and overall aggression throughout the disc.&quot; Sorychta claimed critics and music fans always spot mistakes in their music, because of Lombardo&#x27;s popularity with Slayer—they expect the band to sound like Slayer and complain. However, when Lombardo uses the double bass drum, Sorychta said people complain &quot;now Grip Inc. sound exactly like Slayer.&quot;

The band released &quot;Nemesis&quot; in 1997. Jeffries praised Lombardo&#x27;s &quot;crushing drum work&quot; which takes center stage on the album. Bassist VieBrooks left the band in 1999; he was replaced by Stuart Carruthers. The band released &quot;Solidify&quot; later that year. The album was described as a step towards &quot;progressive and exotic rhythms, structures, and instrumentation, while never compromising intensity&quot;. Lombardo was once again praised for his drumming on the album by Jeffries, who stated his style is &quot;expressive and technically excellent tom work on cuts like &#x27;Bug Juice&#x27; and &#x27;Lockdown.&#x27;&quot; Lombardo is proud of Grip Inc. and believes it made him more creative as a musician.

Lombardo recorded his final album with Grip Inc., &quot;Incorporated&quot;, in 2004. He said the band is on the &quot;back burner&quot; because of time taken up touring with Slayer.

===Philm===

In 1997, Lombardo began collaborating with vocalist/guitarist Gerry Nestler and bassist Juan Perez after the demise of their former band, Civil Defiance. Initially called Letter Bomb, the experimental trio later changed the name to Philm. The group played shows in the LA area and worked on material at Lombardo&#x27;s home studio until Lombardo returned to Slayer in 2001. Nestler and Perez kept going with new drummer George Hernandez, releasing the &quot;M&quot; album under the name Kkleq Muzzil in 2002. Lombardo and Nestler both guested on DJ Spooky&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;Drums of Death&quot;, and eventually reformed Philm in early 2010 after a jam at the famous Rainbow Bar and Grill in West Hollywood, CA, recruiting War&#x27;s Francisco &#x27;Pancho&#x27; Tomaselli on bass.

The band initially recorded a three-song demo with producer Piers Baron; The first release came in August 2010 in the form of a 7&quot; single, a cover of the Black Sabbath classic &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;. It was issued by Volcom Entertainment as part of the Volcom Vinyl Club in translucent blue vinyl, limited to 500 copies. Philm would play a run of U.S. dates as openers for Halford in late 2010 and signed with Mike Patton&#x27;s Ipecac label for the release of their 2012 debut album, &#x27;Harmonic&#x27;, which included updated versions of the songs &quot;Amoniac&quot;, &quot;Dome&quot; and &quot;Meditation&quot;, written by the original Philm line-up and first released by Kkleq Muzzil on the &quot;M&quot; album.

In October 2013, Lombardo, Nestler and stand-in bass player Dan Lutz performed the world live premier of composer Christopher Young&#x27;s Suite from &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; with the Golden State Pops Orchestra at the Warner Grand Theatre in Los Angeles, CA as part of an evening of horror movie scores performed with a 75-piece orchestra.

In July 2014, Philm announced a new partnership with German-based company UDR Records for the release of the group&#x27;s sophomore effort, &#x27;Fire From the Evening Sun&#x27;. The album was supported with a European tour in late 2014. In a September 2015 interview, Lombardo talked about plans for the next Philm release, a 19-song double album recorded in New York City. &quot;It&#x27;s called &#x27;Philm Noir&#x27;, and that&#x27;s piano, bass and drums. Gerry (Paul Nestler, guitar/vocals) plays piano really, really, really well, and Pancho (Francisco Tomaselli), obviously, on bass and myself. I tone it down and play with brushes. So, I would say &#x27;Fire From the Evening Sun&#x27; is the extreme side of Philm, but then we also have a very avant-garde, jazz and ambient side of Philm, which is &#x27;Philm Noir&#x27;.&quot;

Lombardo left the group a couple of months later and proclaimed its demise in early 2016. However, Nestler and Tomaselli carried on with a new drummer and released a third album, &quot;Time Burner&quot;, in early 2021.

===Fantômas===
In 1998, Lombardo joined a side project called Fantômas with Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton and Melvins&#x27; guitarist Buzz Osborne. The band formed when Lombardo was approached by Patton at a Faith No More concert; Patton asked Lombardo about his &quot;fusion&quot; project (Grip Inc.). Patton called Lombardo several months after Faith No More broke up and asked if Lombardo wanted to join Patton&#x27;s fusion project. Lombardo enthusiastically agreed, &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot;

Lombardo later described Fantômas as the hardest music he has played: &quot;Slayer doesn&#x27;t even come close. Slayer was hard in a physical way, this is physically demanding and requires &#x27;feeling&#x27;. (The kind of connectedness that demands) no clicking of sticks.&quot; The drummer described Fantômas&#x27; sound by stating &quot;[I]f Picasso was a musician, this would be his music.&quot; Lombardo recorded four albums with the band.

===Dead Cross===
Lombardo revealed the formation of yet another new musical project, Dead Cross, in November 2015. With ruthless, hardcore punk music, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the band as a &quot;vicious statement of renewed intent from Lombardo, the most influential drummer of the past 30 years.&quot; Dead Cross announced on December 12, 2016, that Mike Patton would front the band. Produced by Ross Robinson and Dead Cross, the band released their eponymous debut album in August 2017.

===Suicidal Tendencies===

Lombardo joined crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies in February 2016 and toured with the band for their spring tour with Megadeth and summer European dates. Fans speculated Lombardo was only playing with the band as a fill-in drummer. Those rumors were dispelled, however, when the band posted a video to their Instagram account on May 15, 2016. The video showed Lombardo recording drums for a new album, &quot;World Gone Mad.&quot; The album was released on September 30, 2016. He left Suicidal Tendencies in 2021.

===Misfits===
In August 2016, the Misfits announced Lombardo as their drummer for their reunion shows. Due to the success of the shows, the Misfits announced in August 2017 that they would do two more. Lombardo would again be on drums.

Lombardo performed two shows - one on December 28, 2017, at MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas and December 30, 2017, at the Forum, Los Angeles, California, in which all 16,000 tickets for the show were sold out in less than one minute.

Lombardo has continued to drum for them and has played at every reunion show from 2016 to the present year.

===Mr. Bungle===
In 2019, Lombardo was announced as the drummer for the seven upcoming Mr. Bungle reunion shows in 2020 in which the band performed their 1986 demo &quot;The Raging Wrath of The Easter Bunny&quot;. In 2020, the band rerecorded the demo, with Lombardo on drums. It was released on October 30, 2020.

===Testament===
In 1999, Lombardo performed drum work on the Testament album &quot;The Gathering&quot;, rounding off a veritable &quot;supergroup&quot; with Steve Di Giorgio and James Murphy. However, he left the band right before the album&#x27;s world tour in 1999-2000.

On March 1, 2022, it was announced that Lombardo had rejoined Testament as the replacement of Gene Hoglan, who had left the band nearly two months earlier. His return to Testament occurred just one month before the start of his first major tour with the band, and they also plan to record a new album with him. Lombardo expressed uncertainty that he would return to Testament after announcing that he would be sitting out of the band&#x27;s 2023 tour dates.

===Side projects===
In 1999, Lombardo collaborated with Italian classical musician &quot;Lorenzo Arruga&quot; to record &quot;Vivaldi – The Meeting&quot;. The seven-track album had drum improvisations on Vivaldi&#x27;s work including two pieces from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; composition. In 2000, Lombardo released a book titled &quot;Dave Lombardo: Power Grooves&quot;. The book and video contained warm ups, eight, sixteen, and double bass grooves, riding the toms and more.

He has appeared on two albums by John Zorn: &quot;Taboo and Exile&quot; (1999) and &quot;Xu Feng&quot; (2000) performing with Zorn, Bill Laswell, Fred Frith, William Winant and others. He also played in Paris with Zorn, Laswell and Frith in an improvisatonal quartet project called Blade Runner.

1999 also saw the release of avant-garde sculptor/filmmaker Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;Cremaster 2&quot;, inspired by the life of Gary Gilmore. Lombardo played an epic drum solo accompanied by a swarm of angry bees on the track &quot;The Man in Black&quot;.

In 2005, Lombardo recorded &quot;Drums of Death&quot; with DJ Spooky. Spooky played some records with Lombardo playing along and interpreting his own rhythms. Spooky recorded the session and took the tapes to his New York recording studio, downloaded it onto his computer, and mixed the beats and drums incorporating scratching and other DJ techniques. Scott Peace-Miller of &quot;Glide Magazine&quot; noted, &quot;Lombardo&#x27;s influence is front and center in the driving, up tempo &quot;Quantum Cyborg Drum Machine,&quot; and the almost straight-up thrash of Kultur Krieg.&quot;

Lombardo recorded six tracks with the Finnish cello metal group Apocalyptica on their 2003 album &quot;Reflections&quot;. Members of Apocalyptica had approached Lombardo in 1998 at a drum clinic in the Netherlands titled &quot;Headbangers Fest&quot;, and asked if Lombardo would like to do a duo with the band, which he agreed to. Both Lombardo and Apocalyptica enjoyed playing a duo and Lombardo said to Apocalyptica, &quot;Whenever you need a drummer, call me!&quot;. The band sent the recording tapes of &quot;Reflections&quot; to his home studio in California where he recorded the drums. Lombardo&#x27;s later Apocalyptica contributions have consisted of playing the drums for the track &quot;Betrayal/Forgiveness&quot; on the 2005 album &quot;Apocalyptica&quot; for the track &quot;Last Hope&quot; on the 2007 album &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; and for the track &quot;2010&quot; on the 2010 album &quot;7th Symphony&quot;.

In October 2009, it was announced that he had recorded a cover of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, featuring Lemmy on vocals and bass, and produced by DJ and producer Baron. The song was made for legendary pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley.

Lombardo has contributed to television and film scores including &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and the seventh season of the Showtime series &quot;Californication&quot;.

On March 1, 2023, Dave Lombardo was announced as touring drummer for a short run of UK shows by Empire State Bastard, the side project of Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil, and touring guitarist Mike Vennart.

==Style and legacy==
Lombardo named Bill Ward, Mitch Mitchell, John Bonham, Ian Paice and Ginger Baker as main influences at early age. Some of his later inspirations include Clive Burr, Phil Taylor, D.H. Peligro, and Dale Crover.

He is known for his fast, aggressive style of play utilizing the double bass drum technique which has earned him the title &quot;the godfather of double bass&quot; by &quot;Drummerworld&quot;. Lombardo states his reasons for using two bass drums: &quot;when you hit the bass drum the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that you kinda get a &#x27;slapback&#x27; from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You&#x27;re not letting them breathe.&quot; In an interview with Guitar Center in the spring of 2012 he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t like a double pedal because when the beater hits, I immediately come back with the other pedal. And that head is resonating, which creates a momentum that isn&#x27;t helpful. It throws me off balance. With two bass drums, I don&#x27;t have any problems. It&#x27;s just a feel thing.&quot; When playing the double bass, Lombardo uses the &#x27;heel-up&#x27; technique and places his pedals at an angle. As well as considering him an influence, Arch Enemy drummer Daniel Erlandsson feels Lombardo is &quot;really tasteful in his playing, and doesn&#x27;t overplay. He&#x27;s gifted with a groove that not many speed metal, or metal drummers generally, have.&quot;

In response to an interview question, &quot;How talented is Dave Lombardo?&quot; King responded, &quot;Have you ever seen the movie &quot;The Natural&quot;? That&#x27;s Dave. He doesn&#x27;t have to try to be good. He comes into the venue 10 or 15 minutes before we hit the stage and he doesn&#x27;t warm up. He just goes and does it, after me and Jeff [Hanneman, guitarist] have been warming up for like an hour.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, Lombardo has stated that when he plays drum beats on the bass drums, he always begins with his left foot.

German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot; named Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; #79 on their list of 100 Classics of Modern Music, with critic Matthias Schönebäumer writing:

Lombardo&#x27;s work has been an influence on many rock and heavy metal drummers. Per Möller Jensen of The Haunted cites Lombardo as a major influence, having grown up listening to Slayer; the band was a big influence on his style and The Haunted&#x27;s. Suffocation drummer Mike Smith also cites Lombardo as an influence. Rocky Gray, former member of the alternative metal band Evanescence was influenced by Lombardo&#x27;s choice of equipment; &quot;All those old school guys are all TAMA guys. Where I&#x27;m from, if you&#x27;re in the big time, you get a TAMA drum set. You have to be good if you&#x27;ve got a TAMA set.&quot;

Richard Christy, former member of Death was &quot;blown away&quot; by Lombardo&#x27;s performance and double bass on the album &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, as was Cannibal Corpse drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz. Raymond Herrera of the band Fear Factory cites Lombardo as one of his major influences, as do Pete Sandoval (Morbid Angel), Igor Cavalera (Sepultura, Cavalera Conspiracy), Chris Pennie (The Dillinger Escape Plan), Adrian Erlandsson (Paradise Lost, Cradle of Filth, Brujeria), George Kollias (Nile, Nightfall), Joey Jordison (Slipknot), Dirk Verbeuren (Soilwork, Megadeth), Derek Roddy (Aurora Borealis, Nile, Hate Eternal), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater, Adrenaline Mob), James Sullivan (Avenged Sevenfold), Steve Asheim (Deicide), Michael &quot;Moose&quot; Thomas (Bullet for My Valentine), Tony Laureano (Dimmu Borgir, Nile, Angelcorpse, Malevolent Creation), Dave Witte (Municipal Waste, Burnt by the Sun, Black Army Jacket), Max Kolesne (Krisiun), Patrick Grün (Caliban), Nick Barker (Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir), and Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall).

Lombardo endorses and uses Tama Drums, Promark Drumsticks, Paiste Cymbals and Remo Drumheads. Lombardo is left handed, but drums right handed and plays a right handed kit.

==Art==
Lombardo began the creation of his first art collection, &quot;Rhythm Mysterium&quot; in early 2014. To execute the project, Lombardo worked with art team Scene Four in Los Angeles, California.
The art collection is titled &quot;RHYTHM MYSTERIUM&quot;. Containing 13 works, the collection is built from the new medium of rhythm-on-canvas.
 In 2015, Lombardo released &quot;LOMBARDO&quot;, a book-and-vinyl set. The book is a comprehensive look at Dave Lombardo&#x27;s artwork built from rhythm, and the vinyl contains Lombardo&#x27;s improvised drum interpretations for each art piece within the book.

<text>The Finnish Spitz (Finnish: &quot;suomenpystykorva&quot; ) is a breed of dog originating in Finland. The breed was originally trained to hunt all types of game from squirrels and other rodents to bears. It is a &quot;bark pointer&quot;, indicating the position of game by barking, and drawing the game animal&#x27;s attention to itself, allowing an easier approach for the hunter. Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting elk. Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog. The breed is typically friendly and good with children, so it is suitable for domestic life. The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979.

==Lineage==
Nearly all dog breeds’ genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Karelo-Finnish Laika, the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.

==History==
It is assumed that the Finnish Spitz developed from Spitz-type dogs that came from central Russia with migrants 3,000 years ago. These small clans of woodsmen relied on their dogs to help them obtain food, and the excellent hunting ability of the Finnish Spitz made it a favorite choice.

By 1880, as advanced means of transportation brought diverse peoples and their dogs together, Finnish Spitzes mated with other breeds of dogs, and were becoming extinct as a distinct breed. At about that time, a Finnish sportsman from Helsinki named Hugo Roos observed the pure native Finnish Spitz while hunting in the northern forests. He realized the many virtues of the pure Finnish Spitz breed and decided to select dogs that were untainted examples of the genuine Finnish Spitz in order to try to revive the breed. Thirty years of careful breeding resulted in the modern Finnish Spitz; the dogs are descendants of his original foundation stock.

Finnish Kennel Club has revised the breed standard six times, and the latest version was confirmed in 1996. In 1979, when the club celebrated its 90th anniversary, the Finnish Spitz was declared Finland&#x27;s national dog breed. The club is also working for including the hunting experience with the Finnish Spitz on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.

==Appearance==
The proper conformation is a square build, meaning that the length of the body is the same or slightly shorter than the height of the withers to the ground. The length of the body is measured from the point of the shoulder or forechest in front of the withers to the rump. Females are usually a little longer in the back than males. Both sexes should appear slightly longer in the leg than the back.

Dewclaws can appear on front and/or back feet. If back claws appear, they should be removed. The front dewclaws can be removed, if desired.

===Coat===
The Finnish Spitz has a typical double coat, which consists of a soft, dense undercoat and long, harsh guard hairs that can measure 2.5 to 5 cm (one to two inches) long. The outer coat should not exceed at the ruff. The coat should be stiffer, denser, and longer on the neck, back, back of thighs, and plume of the tail, shorter on the head and legs. Male dogs should sport a slightly longer and coarser coat than female ones, who have a slightly more refined coat.

The pluma of the tail is important to the overall look of the dog but should not be too long. Feathered long tail hairs without sustenance can give the dog an unkempt look. Additionally, the tailset is important and the Finnish Spitz should be able to move its tail from one side to the other. Most Finnish Spitz have a preferred side and this is not incorrect.

Proper care of the coat is most important. The Finnish Spitz blows coat or loses its undercoat twice a year. It is imperative that owners brush out the old undercoat so the new coat can grow properly. Although a dog may look fluffy and full, excessive undercoat may cause serious skin problems.

In the show ring, the coat should be shown as completely natural; a brush through the coat is acceptable, but no trimming is allowed, not even of whiskers. However, any excessive undercoat should be removed. Some exhibitors choose to show dogs with excessive undercoat to make the dog&#x27;s coat appear more lush. Failing to shed undercoat is considered neglect by some judges who prefer a clean and combed coat. Another exception is the hair under the bottom of the feet. The hair under the feet as well as the toe nails should be nicely trimmed for show.

===Color===

Puppies are often described as looking similar to a red fox cub. They are born dark grey, black, brown, or fawn with a vast amount of black. A fawn-colored puppy or one with a large amount of white of the chest is not preferable for show purposes. The color of the adult dog can be assessed by an experienced breeder at birth, but even then, the color may change slightly as the puppy grows.

The adult color is typically a golden-red with variations from pale honey to dark chestnut. There is no preference for a particular shade as long as the color is bright and clear with no hints of dullness. The coat should never be a solid color. It should be shaded and without any defined color changes. The coat is usually at its darkest shade on the back of the dog, gradually getting lighter around the chest and belly. The undercoat must always be lighter in color than the topcoat, but is never allowed to be white. A small patch of white, no more than 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) wide, is allowable on the chest, and white tips on the feet are acceptable, but not desired.

The nose, lips, and rims of eyes should always be black.

===Height and weight===
Height at withers (American Kennel Club breed standard):
*Males: 44.5 to 50.8 cm (17½ to 20 inches)
*Females: 39.4 to 45.7 cm (15½ to 18 inches)

Weight:
*Males: 
*Females: 

==Temperament==
This breed is active, alert and lively. They need one or two long walks each day and will be fairly inactive indoors. This breed will not adapt well to a strictly kenneled living situation; they need a balance of outdoor exercise and indoor play time with the family.

Finnish Spitzes are considered to interact well with people and they are especially good with children. They are always ready to play with children but if ignored, they will usually walk away. As with all dogs, young children and dogs should always be supervised when together. It is an independent breed and will be attached to its family while remaining aloof with strangers. The Finnish Spitz tends to be protective; males have more domineering traits than females.

Most Finnish Spitzes get along well with other dogs in the house. They are bred as a hunting dog and thus are unreliable around small animals and pet birds, but on an individual basis may live well with cats, especially if they are raised with them.

===Barking===
The breed barks at anything perceived to be out of the ordinary. Barking is a major part of their hunting activities. In Finland, these dogs are prized for their barking abilities, which can range from short, sharp barks to many barks per minute that sound like a yodel. The Finnish Spitz can bark as many as 160 times per minute. In Scandinavia, a competition is held to find the &quot;King of the Barkers.&quot; In Finland, their barking ability in the field must be proven before a conformation championship can be earned.

When used as a hunting companion, the barking is a way to signal the hunter that the dog has located prey in the forest. They can be trained to reduce the amount of barking, although the barking does make them superb watchdogs.

===Training===
Finnish Spitzes are independent, strong-willed, intelligent dogs. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. This breed will not respond well to harsh training methods. They should be trained with a light touch and positive reinforcement methods. With patience and calm yet firm handling, the Finnish Spitz can be a wonderful companion.

==Health==
The Finnish Spitz is typically a very healthy breed, with few general health concerns. However, breeders should be consulted to understand the prevalence of a specific disorder in this breed. Below is a short list of what is known to occur:
*Elbow dysplasia
*Epilepsy 
:Factors associated with idiopathic epilepsy in Finnish Spitz dogs are age (&lt;4 years old), number of feeding times per day, exposure to extreme stressful situations (hunting), and sex. Epilepsy was more prevalent in male dogs than females. Dogs that had idiopathic epilepsy were found to have depressed, nervous, and desensitized character. 
*Hip dysplasia
*Patellar luxation

Median lifespan is about 11.2 years.

<text>Istres-Le Tubé Air Base ( or BA 125) is a large multi-role tasked French Air and Space Force base located near Istres, northwest of Marseille, France. The airport facilities are also known as Istres - Le Tubé (ICAO airport code: LFMI).

==Operational units and uses==

===French Air and Space Force===

The user of the base is the French Air and Space Force with several operational units on the base, including:
* Escadron de Ravitaillement en Vol et de Transport 1/31 Bretagne
* Escadron de Ravitaillement en Vol 4/31 Sologne
* DAMS 11.004 (&quot;Dépôt atelier de munitions spéciales&quot;) or Special ammunition storage, responsible for the hardened storage of the nuclear mid-range Air-Sol Moyenne Portée ASMP-A missiles to be used by fighter squadron 2/4 in its deterrent role.
* Air defence squadron 01.950 responsible for the base air defense.
* 25th Air Engineer Regiment
* Guard detachment (Fusiliers Commandos de l&#x27;Air) responsible for the base security and ground defences.

===Other uses===
The base also hosts a helicopter squadron and a large repair and training facility. In addition, it also includes EPNER (École du Personnel Navigant d’Essais et de Réception); test facilities for DGA Essais en vol, Dassault Aviation, SNECMA, Thales and some aeronautical units of the French Navy. More than 5,000 personnel work on the base.

Secondary users occasionally include the United States Air Force (USAF), during Allied operations engaging United States and France. During Operation Allied Force, USAF Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and Lockheed U-2s operated out of the base. Istres was the home of U-2 detachment OL-FR (Operating Location-FRance). Istres was also designated by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL). The base&#x27;s runway is long and wide. An additional overrun area long was built for Airbus Industries in 1992. It has the same characteristics as the runway, making it the longest runway in Western Europe and thus suited to Shuttle landings.

==World War II==
Built prior to World War II, Istres Air Base was first used by the French Air Force during the early part of the war, and after the 1940 Battle of France and the June Armistice with Nazi Germany, became part of the limited () air force of the Vichy Government. It was attacked on several missions by Allied bombers based in England while under German control after November 1942. It was seized by Allied forces during Operation Dragoon, the Invasion of Southern France in August 1944 and was repaired and placed into operational use by the United States Army Air Forces XII Engineer Command, being turned over to Twelfth Air Force on 27 August 1944.

The airfield was designated by the Americans as Istres/Le Tubé Airfield or Advanced Landing Ground Y-17. It was also given the AAF designation of USAAF Station 196. Twelfth Air Force initially assigned the 324th Fighter Group to the airfield on 2 September, with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. However the 324th only remained a few days before moving forward to Amberieu on 6 September.

The main USAAF use of Istres was by the 64th Troop Carrier Group, which operated Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports from the airfield from September to November 1944. When the combat units moved north into eastern France, Istres was used by Air Transport Command as a transshipment point for supplies and Allied personnel, being administratively controlled by the 1411th Army Air Force Base Unit.

With the end of the war, the Americans used Istres as a staging point between Occupied Germany and Morocco for air transport of personnel back to the United States. It was returned to full French control in October 1945.

Sometime after World War II, until May 1958, Base Aérienne 125 was host to the Royal Air Force Liaison Party, that serviced transient British and Commonwealth military aircraft staging to and from the United Kingdom. In May 1958, the Royal Air Force Liaison Party, moved to Base Aérienne 115 Orange-Caritat where it continued into the early 1960s.

==Incidents==

On 31 March 1992, Trans-Air Service Flight 671, a Boeing 707, made an emergency landing at Istres after engines 3 and 4 had separated from the wing in turbulence at . The aircraft performed a flapless, downwind landing with a touch-down speed of nearly and the right wing on fire from the pouring fuel. The gear failed and the aircraft slid off the far end of the runway, but the crew of five survived and the cargo was saved. The incident brought to light severe deficiencies in Kabo Air&#x27;s operations — the aircraft had passed mandatory maintenance and was overloaded.

<doc id="714388" wikidata="Q427987" url="?curid=714388" title="Starfire (Teen Titans)">
<text>Starfire is a superheroine created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez appearing in American comic books created by DC Comics. She debuted in a preview story inserted within &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October, 1980). Since the character&#x27;s introduction, Starfire has been a major recurring character in Teen Titans and various other iterations of the team, sometimes depicted as the team&#x27;s leader, and a significant love interest for Dick Grayson.

Within the main continuity of the DC Universe, her origin is revealed to be Princess Koriand&#x27;r, an alien princess from the planet Tamaran and heir to the throne until she was ousted in a coup by her elder sister, Komand&#x27;r (also known as Blackfire), who sold her into slavery. Subjected to torture and sexual exploitation, Koriand&#x27;r was also subjected to experiments performed by alien scientists, which gave her additional powers. Escaping her captors, she found herself on Earth and befriended the Teen Titans, becoming a long-lasting member of the team. The character has appeared on several other teams, including the Outsiders, Outlaws, and Justice League Odyssey. While on Earth, the character has been depicted as a model under the alias Kory Anders, occasionally the leader of the Teen Titans, and was the principal of Teen Titans Academy during a period in which the Titans help trained future superheroes of the DC Universe.

Starfire has been featured in various media outside comic books. Within television, she is notably voiced by Hynden Walch in the animated series &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;. Kari Wahlgren voices the character in the DC Animated Movie Universe, &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, and &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, Starfire first appeared in a in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #26 (October 1980), in a preview story heralding a new incarnation of the Teen Titans that also introduced Cyborg and Raven. The new series, &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, debuted in November 1980, and the Teen Titans subsequently became DC Comics&#x27; most popular superhero team of its day.

Pérez said of his design for Starfire:
==Fictional character biography==

Princess Koriand&#x27;r was born on the planet Tamaran, which is located in the Vega system. Koriand&#x27;r was the second of three children. Her older sister, Komand&#x27;r was the first in the line of succession, but she was crippled by a childhood illness that robbed her of her natural Tamaranean ability to convert ultraviolet light into flight energy. Therefore, she was deemed unworthy to be queen and the succession fell to Koriand&#x27;r. When both sisters were sent to train with the legendary Warlords of Okaara, the bitter Komand&#x27;r ran off, allying herself with the Citadel. They used Komand&#x27;r&#x27;s information to successfully invade Tamaran, and King Myand&#x27;r turned Koriand&#x27;r over to the Citadel to ensure peace.
Koriand&#x27;r spent living in the Citadel for six years under physical and emotional torture, even sexual abuse, until she and Komand&#x27;r were both captured by the Psions for experimentation. Widely known to be a sadistic scientific extraterrestrial race, the Psions performed a deadly experiment on both sisters to see just how much energy their Tamaranean bodies could absorb before exploding from the overload. During the procedure, forces loyal to Komand&#x27;r attacked the Psion ship to rescue her, and while the Psions were distracted, Koriand&#x27;r broke free using her new ability of starbolts (destructive blasts of solar energy) acquired through experimentation. Against her better judgment, she decided to free Komand&#x27;r who was still absorbing energy. However, far from grateful, Komand&#x27;r struck her sister down with the same - but much stronger - starbolt power and had her restrained for later execution. Koriand&#x27;r escaped and eventually found her way to Earth, where she gained the help of the Teen Titans.

===New life on Earth and as a member of the Teen Titans===
Starfire would join the new iteration of the Teen Titans with Robin, Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, Cyborg, Changeling and Raven. The first adventure she had with her teammates was battling against Grant Wilson aka the Ravager, the son of the mercenary Deathstroke The Terminator, who was gifted enhanced abilities like his father due to the experiments by the terrorist organization H.I.V.E.. She would also aid the Titans by protecting the planet Earth and the dimension of Azarath from the demon Trigon The Terrible, and battling against various supervillains including the Fearsome Five, Brother Blood and the former members of the Brotherhood of Evil, Madame Rouge, and General Zahl.

At one point, she became a successful super model under her human alias &quot;Kory Anders&quot;. She dated and fell in love with a human man named Franklin Crandall. Crandall turned out to be a freelance spy working for H.I.V.E. , and was eventually killed because he decided he truly loved Starfire and couldn&#x27;t betray his feelings towards her. Starfire attempted to kill the H.I.V.E. agent who committed the murder, but was stopped by Wonder Girl.

Starfire was also romantically linked with Dick Grayson (aka Robin, later Nightwing) in various runs of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and aftermath===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Starfire is among the heroes who battle Alexander Luthor Jr. and stop him from destroying the multiverse. She is presumed dead, but survives and is teleported to another planet alongside Animal Man and Adam Strange.

After returning to Earth, the three heroes reunite on several occasions, including the limited series &quot;Countdown to Adventure&quot; and &quot;Rann–Thanagar War&quot;.

===Justice League and R.E.B.E.L.S.===
Following the dissolution of the JLA in &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Starfire joins Kimiyo Hoshi&#x27;s new Justice League. She quits the team shortly afterward and joins L.E.G.I.O.N. The group battles a group of Tamaranean refugees led by Blackfire and agrees to let them live in an uninhabited portion of Rann.

===&quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Starfire was sold to the Citadel to protect Tamaran from them. Additionally, Blackfire is a neutral figure who assists her in retaking Tamaran from the parasitic Blight.

===&quot;Starfire&quot;===
In 2015, Starfire received a self-titled series where she returns to Earth and moves to Key West. Additionally, she adopts Syl&#x27;Khee, a worm-like alien based on Silkie. She desired to experience a normal human life and appeared to have no interest in heroism or her former life. She befriended the local Sheriff, Stella Gomez, who helped her find a place to live and constantly dealt with Kori&#x27;s naiveté regarding human culture. Kori also got to know Stella&#x27;s widowed brother, Sol (who happened to bear a striking resemblance to Dick Grayson), and later began dating him. Starfire later met Atlee, a waitress who was secretly a super-powered woman from a civilization living below the Earth&#x27;s surface. Despite no longer wanting be a hero, trouble continued to find Kori in her new home and she was forced to defend Key West from various threats. After a trip to Atlee&#x27;s home, Starfire decided that she should once again use her powers to help others. She left her friends in Key West and tried her hand at being a hero once again.

== Character overview ==
=== Sexuality and cultural preferences ===
Within the depiction of Tamaran&#x27;s culture in the DC Universe, concepts such as open marriage are more common and accepted. Due to her upbringing, Starfire&#x27;s sex-positivism and free-thinking habits such as a fondness for practicing nudism, openness to polygamous relationships and acceptance of &quot;open sex&quot; and pansexual &quot;free-love&quot; with persons regardless of terrestrial species, race or gender, usually lead her into conflict with Earth&#x27;s more reserved culture and customs. In recent years, the character was developed to be polyamorous and pansexual.

==Powers and abilities==
Starfire is a Tamaranean and as such her physiology is designed to constantly absorb ultraviolet radiation. The radiation is then converted to pure energy, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds. Starfire is capable of using this power to fly in space and even go fast enough to cross several solar systems in minutes to seconds. This energy also gives her incredible superhuman strength and durability. After being experimented on by the Psions, Starfire gained the ability to release her absorbed energy into powerful blasts called &quot;starbolts&quot;. 

Starfire is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat, having been trained by the Warlords of Okaara. Her natural strength, combined with her fighting skills, allowed her to defeat the powerful Donna Troy about one out of three times during purely hand to hand matches. She later proved strong enough to fight against Wonder Woman for a short period of time and, during a fit of rage, was so strong that Donna Troy was unable to contain her without the help of Mon-El. In the 2003 TV series, Starfire was strong enough to easily throw vehicles and destroy entire streets with her blows.

As shown in the &quot;Insiders&quot; crossover story arc (&quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Outsiders&quot;), Starfire can also release nearly all of her stored energy as a powerful omni-directional explosive burst, many times stronger and more powerful than her standard blasts. The released energy leaves her in a weakened state. She&#x27;s also shown that she can absorb ambient ultraviolet energy consciously. Starfire demonstrated more control over her powers in the New 52 reboot, using her internal energy to melt the metal of Jason Todd&#x27;s gun when it came into contact with her skin. 

Starfire, like all Tamaraneans, is capable of assimilating languages through physical contact with another person. When Starfire attempts to do so with a male, she typically does so by kissing because it is &quot;more fun&quot; for her. She also doesn&#x27;t need to eat, drink, or sleep, and doesn&#x27;t require an atmosphere to breathe unless she is low on ultraviolet energy.

<text>Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels (18 June 1865 – 29 August 1913) was a German physicist. He was born in Italy to Captain Theodore Pockels and Alwine Becker. He obtained a doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1888, and from 1900 to 1913 he was professor of theoretical physics at the University of Heidelberg.

Pockels studied under the guidance of Woldemar Voigt, who was a physicist working on the general phenomena of piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity. In 1890, Pockels developed a general theory of electro-optics. In 1893 he discovered that a steady electric field applied to certain birefringent materials causes the refractive index to vary, approximately in proportion to the strength of the field. The coefficient of proportionality is of the order of to . This phenomenon is now called the Pockels effect.

Pockels was awarded the prize of the Heidelberg Jubilee Foundation for the Encouragement of Scientific
Research in 1906.

His sister Agnes Pockels (1862–1935) was a pioneer in chemistry.

<text>CEA Valduc or the Valduc Centre for Nuclear Studies is a French nuclear facility, part of the (DAM) of the French Atomic Energy Commission; dedicated to the study, manufacturing, maintenance and dismantling of nuclear weapons.

The site was acquired in 1957 by the CEA and the centre built in 1958. It has an area of 6.7 km2 (now 7.5 km2), while the actual site occupies 1.8 km2. Seventeen basic nuclear installations are on the site, comprising a total of 25,000 m2 of floor space. The centre is surrounded by a zone where photography and cartography are prohibited but through traffic is permitted on roads.

There are about 1,000 CEA employees working in the centre, as well as about 300 employees from contractors.

Since a restructuring decision of the CEA in 1996, Valduc has been the sole site responsible for military nuclear material. From 1980 to 1993, the French Air Force occupied a 0.4 km2 plot where it operated a plant for the assembly of nuclear warheads for air and land-based missiles (&quot;ASMP&quot; and &quot;Hadès&quot;).

A proportion of the locals consider that Valduc does not bring benefits to the area but imposes constraints and discourages people from coming to the area. This is partly because most employees commute from far away and the centre does not pay local taxes to the local commune (because it is a public research establishment). However, the commune government asserts that some of the activities at CEA/Valduc are taxable. In 2003, Valduc was considered partially taxable, a move which the CEA contested.(CEA, Financial report 2003). The Dijon administrative court considered that activities related to the military were not taxable but those pertaining to general technology development and consulting for private industry were taxable.

<doc id="714399" wikidata="Q2633642" url="?curid=714399" title="Will Parry (His Dark Materials)">
<text>Will Parry is one of the protagonists in Philip Pullman&#x27;s trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, along with Lyra Belacqua. He first appears in the series at the start of the second novel, &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, and continues through to the final book, &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. Introduced as a 12-year-old boy, he meets and befriends Lyra in the world of Cittàgazze and teams up with her in order to uncover the mysteries of Dust and the disappearance of his father many years previously. He takes possession of the Subtle Knife which he uses to aid Lord Asriel in his bid to destroy the Authority.

==Description==
Will is the only son of the explorer John Parry and Elaine Parry, a woman who suffers from mental health problems, and whom he has taken care of since he was young, due to her condition. Will is unable to remember his father, a former Royal Marine, who has not been heard of since he vanished on an expedition to the Arctic when Will was only a baby, and who we later learn has wandered into another world and is unable to find his way back. Will lives in Winchester with his mother and their cat Moxie.

Will is described as having straight black eyebrows, dark hair with a strong, jutting jaw. He is quite stocky and has a muscular build (for his age) and dark, fierce eyes into which most characters in the trilogy avoid looking directly. Although he is supposed to have dark hair, he can be seen on the cover of the US edition with fair, brown hair, and in the Spanish edition with reddish hair. 

Will is quieter than Lyra, he is serious and courteous, he has a strong sense of morality (even paying for food and clothes taken from the empty city of Cittàgazze) and is very self-assured, always standing up for himself and his friends and refusing to be spoken down to. He demonstrates great bravery several times in the novels, though he dislikes fighting, and other characters often find him fierce and intimidating. Will is exceptionally independent for a child of his age.

==Dæmon==
During Will&#x27;s journey into the Land of the Dead in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, he is forced to separate from part of his soul. This turns out to be his dæmon, who had previously lived unseen inside him. As Will is still a child when this happens, his dæmon had not yet settled into one particular form. However, towards the end of the novel, his dæmon is touched (described as a very intimate and usually forbidden action) by Lyra and she settles as a large cat with lustrous and subtle-coloured fur. She is named Kirjava by the witch Serafina Pekkala (&#x27;Kirjava&#x27; means &#x27;mottled&#x27; in Finnish).

Unusually, Kirjava has the ability to move far away from Will, much farther than dæmons normally can from their humans. It is this power that allows her and Pantalaimon to run away from Will and Lyra, having been rescued, in order to punish the children for abandoning them when they entered the Land of the Dead. During their absence, they travel through many worlds and though they return and reconcile with their humans, they agree to keep what they did and saw a secret until they feel the time is right to tell their humans.

==Role==
===&quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;===
At the beginning of &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, Will is trying to discover the truth behind his father&#x27;s disappearance and searches his house for a box of his mother&#x27;s letters, which may contain a clue to his whereabouts. However, he is disturbed early in the morning by a group of government agents breaking into his house who are also searching for the same thing. Having found the letters, he flees but accidentally kills one of the men while doing so. He heads to Oxford so that he can talk to his father&#x27;s lawyer and while looking for somewhere to sleep that night, he discovers an interdimensional window leading to the world of Cittàgazze. He explores the mysterious city and finds it completely empty of people – except for a girl about his own age called Lyra, who seems at first to be selfish and haughty. Will questions Lyra and soon realises that she is also from another world, one that is very different from his own. When Lyra learns that Will&#x27;s world also has an Oxford in it, she decides to go there and speak to the physicists about Dust.

Will returns there with her the next day but is unable to learn much more about his father from either his solicitor or the local library. Upon reading his mother&#x27;s letters, however, he discovers that his father disappeared when he was just a year old while exploring an ‘anomaly’ on an expedition in Alaska – this turns out to be a window to Cittàgazze, exactly like the one Will discovered himself. Shortly afterwards, Lyra&#x27;s alethiometer (her truth-telling device) is stolen by Sir Charles Latrom in Oxford. Will goes back and confronts Sir Charles but is told he will only return the alethiometer in exchange for the Subtle Knife, located in the Torre degli Angeli, a stone tower in Cittàgazze. Sir Charles is unable to retrieve the knife himself due to the Spectres which infest Cittàgazze and feed on the consciousness of adults. Will and Lyra search the tower but are attacked by another man, an inhabitant of Cittàgazze, who wants the knife for himself. Together they overcome the assailant and win the knife but Will is badly wounded – the little and ring fingers of his left hand are cut off. Meeting the knife&#x27;s original owner, he reveals to them that Will&#x27;s injuries are the &#x27;mark&#x27; of the subtle knife, which indicate that the knife must pass from him to Will, prompting him to spend some time instructing Will in the use of the knife before he encourages them to leave, intending to commit suicide so that the spectres cannot consume him.

As well as being able to cut through to other worlds, the Subtle Knife is also able to cut through any material or object in any of the worlds. Armed with it, Will and Lyra return to Sir Charles’ house and steal back the alethiometer, narrowly evading Sir Charles and his guest, Marisa Coulter. However, the very next morning they are attacked by a group of Cittàgazze children who are furious at them for stealing the knife, led by the younger brother and sister of the man who tried to take it for himself. They flee from the city and are rescued by a group of witches from Lyra&#x27;s world, led by Serafina Pekkala.

Lyra and Will, now escorted by the witches, continue their search for Will&#x27;s father but are unknowingly being followed by Mrs Coulter and a troop of Spectres. One night, Will, unable to sleep, walks to the summit of the mountain they had been traversing where he encounters a mysterious man. The man realises that Will is the bearer of the Subtle Knife and instructs him to take it to Lord Asriel. However, just as Will recognises that the man is his father, the man is killed by a witch, bitter that he had once rejected her. Will captures the witch and berates her but she kills herself. He then returns to the camp, only to find that the witches have been attacked by Spectres and that Lyra has been captured. Two angels named Baruch and Balthamos, who had been following Will&#x27;s father, appear to him, urging him to follow them to Lord Asriel.

===&quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;===
With Lyra missing, Will refuses to take the Subtle Knife to Lord Asriel until he finds her. Baruch and Balthamos reluctantly agree and with their help, Will tracks her down to a cave in the Himalayas, back in her own world. Along the way he meets Lyra&#x27;s old friend Iorek Byrnison, who is looking to migrate south due to the melting of the Arctic ice, and together they locate Lyra&#x27;s cave where she is being kept in a drugged sleep by Mrs Coulter.

Will infiltrates the cave using the knife, but just as he prepares to pull Lyra out, the presence of Mrs Coulter reminds him of his sick mother and his concentration slips, causing the Subtle Knife to shatter. He collects the pieces and they manage to escape when Mrs Coulter is attacked by two of Lord Asriel&#x27;s Gallivespian spies. The four of them make it safely to a window Will had opened previously and move into another world. Lyra then tells Will about a dream she had during her long sleep in which she talked to her old friend Roger (whom she accidentally led to his death at the end of Northern Lights), whose soul is now trapped in the World of the Dead. Will agrees to go there with her to try and save him, if he can get Iorek to fix the knife.

Will finds Iorek the next day and Iorek reluctantly agrees to help him mend the knife. With the knife repaired, Will and Lyra cut their way into the World of the Dead. However, as they approach the island where the souls of the deceased are imprisoned, they realise they must leave behind their dæmons if they are to enter. Will&#x27;s dæmon, who lives inside him, is torn away, causing him terrible pain. Lyra finds Roger&#x27;s ghost and apologises before Will cuts a window back out to the world, allowing the billions of souls to be released. However, from his father&#x27;s ghost, Will learns that his and Lyra&#x27;s dæmons are now in the world where Lord Asriel is waging war on the Authority. They cut back there and escape with the dæmons to another world, narrowly avoiding the attentions of the Spectres they are now vulnerable to. However, when they wake up the next morning, the dæmons have fled from them.

A group of highly developed animals approach them and carry them back to their village where Lyra&#x27;s friend Mary Malone, a physicist from Will&#x27;s world, is waiting among the Mulefa. They tell her about their adventures and in return Mary tells them about the time she first fell in love and how she stopped believing in God (she had previously been a nun). Will goes back out the next morning with Lyra to find their dæmons. When they stop to eat, Lyra feeds him a piece of fruit that was given to them by Mary (a reference to the Fall), and they realise that they have fallen in love with each other. Their love causes Dust, which is the source of human consciousness and free will, to stop escaping but instead to fall upon the world once more.

However, the very next day their dæmons return and tell them what they have learned. To preserve the existence of Dust, all of the windows between the worlds must be closed, and because dæmons can only live for a short time outside of their own worlds, Will and Lyra must each return to their own world. Will is also told that using the Subtle Knife had produced the Spectres initially and that it must therefore be destroyed: he can no longer use it to travel between worlds. Will realises that he and Lyra must separate forever.

Will, Lyra and Mary return to Cittàgazze and he cuts a window back into the Oxford of his world. Before they part, Lyra leads him to the University&#x27;s Botanic Garden where she finds a certain bench, one that also exists in her world in the same place. They promise to return there, every year for the rest of their lives at noon on midsummer&#x27;s day so they can feel close to one another again. Lyra steps back into Cittàgazze and Will seals the window behind her. Finally Will has to break the knife and he recalls how it had broken the first time, when he had thought of his mother. This time he thinks of Lyra and the knife shatters, as it is unable to cut through his love for her. He collects the pieces and leaves with Mary as the two discuss how to cover up their absence and best help his mother.

===After the books===
In the 2013 edition of &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; released in the UK, the post-script &quot;Lantern Slides&quot; section reveals that Will later becomes a medical student and eventually a doctor in his world. His time bearing the Subtle Knife has given him the gift of diagnosing patients, though he tries to hide this gift early in his studies as others would believe it to be supernatural.

==Adaptations==
In the unabridged audio books, Will&#x27;s role is read by Steven Webb in &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; and by Peter England in &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, while in the BBC&#x27;s dramatisation he was played by Daniel Anthony. In the National Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; in 2003, Will was portrayed by Dominic Cooper. In the BBC adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, he is portrayed by Amir Wilson.

<doc id="714401" wikidata="Q3636587" url="?curid=714401" title="Battle of Preston (1715)">
<text>The Battle of Preston (9–14 November 1715) was the final action of the Jacobite rising of 1715, an attempt to put James Francis Edward Stuart on the British throne in place of George I. After two days of street-fighting, the Jacobite commander Thomas Forster surrendered to government troops under General Charles Wills. It was arguably the last battle fought on English soil.

==Background==
The Jacobites moved south into England with little opposition, and by the time they reached Preston, Lancashire had grown to about 4,000 in number. Their cavalry entered Preston on the night of 9 November 1715, and as they approached two troops of dragoons and part of a militia regiment retreated to Wigan.

General Charles Wills was ordered to halt their advance, and left Manchester on 11 November with six regiments, arriving on 12 November. The Jacobite leader was Thomas Forster, a Northumberland squire with minimal military experience, selected largely because he was a Protestant; learning of Wills&#x27; approach, he decided to stay and made the mistake of withdrawing troops from a strong defensive position at Ribble bridge, outside Preston.

==Battle==
The Jacobites had barricaded the principal streets of Preston, and Wills ordered an immediate attack, which met with fire from the barricades and from houses, resulting in the Hanoverian attack being repulsed with heavy losses. Wills then had houses set on fire, with the aim of fires spreading along to the Jacobite positions, and the Jacobites tried to do the same to houses taken as government positions. At night, Wills&#x27;s order to light the government-held positions for identification helped the Jacobite snipers, but overnight many Jacobites left the town. The legend of these actions is recounted in a well-known Lancashire ballad, &quot;Lo! The Bird is Fallen&quot;.

On 13 November, additional government forces arrived from Newcastle under George Carpenter, which Wills deployed to ensure the besieged Jacobites could not escape. Although casualties were relatively low, their position was hopeless, and Forster was advised by his subordinate Henry Oxburgh to open negotiations with Wills for surrender on terms. The Scots were not informed and on learning of this they paraded through the streets, threatening any Jacobites who might even allude to a surrender, killing or wounding several people. At 7:00 am on Monday 14 November, Forster offered an unconditional surrender, which Wills rejected unless it also applied to the Scots; after some discussion, they confirmed they would surrender on the same terms.

==Aftermath==
1,468 Jacobites were taken prisoner, 463 of them English. George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton, William Gordon, 6th Viscount of Kenmure, William Maxwell, 5th Earl of Nithsdale, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, and William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne, were among those captured and later sentenced to be executed for treason under an act of attainder. However, Winton and Nithsdale escaped from the Tower of London. In May 1716 Colonel Oxburgh was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for his part in the rising. All surviving prisoners except for members of the Clan Gregor were later pardoned by the Indemnity Act 1717.

Seventeen Jacobites were killed and twenty-five wounded. Government casualties were close to 300 killed and wounded. Of the ordinary Highland clansmen captured at the Battle of Preston, many were transported to the Americas.

==Last battle on English soil==

The battle of Preston is often claimed to have been the last fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of &quot;battle&quot;, for which there are different interpretations. Preston was a siege rather than a pitched battle, so the Battle of Sedgemoor fought in 1685 is also a contender for the title of the last battle, as is the skirmish at Clifton Moor near Penrith in Cumbria on 18 December 1745 during the &#x27;Forty-Five&#x27; Jacobite rebellion. However, there was a great deal of savage fighting in streets all over the town during the Battle of Preston, far more than in most sieges. It was as much of a battle as, for example, the Battle of St Albans (1455) in the Wars of the Roses, which was also fought in the streets of a town, but which is generally regarded as a battle and not a siege, as is the Battle of Reading of 1688. The Battle of Bossenden Wood, fought on 31 May 1838, is a much later contender.

<doc id="714407" wikidata="Q271956" url="?curid=714407" title="Nikolay Zhukovsky (scientist)">
<text>Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky (; – 17 March 1921) was a Russian scientist, mathematician and engineer, and a founding father of modern aero- and hydrodynamics. Whereas contemporary scientists scoffed at the idea of human flight, Zhukovsky was the first to undertake the study of airflow. He is often called the &quot;Father of Russian Aviation&quot;.

The Joukowsky transform is named after him, while the fundamental aerodynamical theorem, the Kutta–Joukowski theorem, is named after both him and German mathematician Martin Kutta.

==Life==

Zhukovsky was born in the village of Orekhovo, Vladimir Governorate, Russian Empire. In 1868 he graduated from Moscow University where he studied under August Davidov. From 1872 he was a professor at the Imperial Technical School. In 1904, he established the world&#x27;s first Aerodynamic Institute in Kachino near Moscow. He was influenced by both Ernst Mach and his son Ludwig Mach. From 1918 he was the head of TsAGI (Central AeroHydroDynamics Institute).


Zhukovsky was the first scientist to explain mathematically the origin of aerodynamic lift, through his circulation hypothesis, the first to establish that the lift force generated by a body moving through an ideal fluid is proportional to the velocity and the circulation around the body. He is credited with the Joukowsky airfoil - an ideal shape of the aerodynamic profile having as essential elements a rounded nose (leading edge), double surface (finite thickness), cambered or symmetrical, and a sharp tail (trailing edge). He built the first wind tunnel in Russia. He was also responsible for the eponymous water hammer equation used by civil engineers.

He published a derivation for the maximum energy obtainable from a turbine in 1920, at the same time as German scientist Albert Betz. This is known controversially as Betz&#x27;s law, as this result was also derived by British scientist Frederick W. Lanchester. This is a famous example of Stigler&#x27;s law of eponymy.

In December 1918 at Zhukovsky&#x27;s proposal and with his active participation, the Soviet government founded the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), of which he became the first head. At the same time, theoretical courses for military pilots were founded, later transformed into the Moscow Aviation Technical College. The Institute of Engineers of the Red Air Fleet was established on its base in 1920, and in May 1922 it became the Air Force Engineering Academy named after Zhukovsky.

Zhukovsky died in Moscow in 1921.

==Recognition==
A city near Moscow and the crater Zhukovskiy on the Moon are both named in his honor.

The State Zhukovsky Prize was established in 1920 &#x27;for the best works in mathematics&#x27;.

The Russian Air Force&#x27;s engineering academy was named for him, later reorganized into the Zhukovsky – Gagarin Air Force Academy. In May 2016 Moscow&#x27;s fourth largest airport was named in his honor.

Mosfilm produced a 1950 eponymous biopic directed by Vsevolod Pudovkin with music by Vissarion Shebalin, which earned Pudovkin and Shebalin the USSR State Prize in 1951.

The Russian Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute and the Ukrainian National Aerospace University – Kharkiv Aviation Institute are named after him.

The Zhukovsky House is a museum dedicated to his memory

<doc id="714413" wikidata="Q866062" url="?curid=714413" title="Biscari massacre">
<text>The Biscari massacre was a war crime committed by members of the United States Army during World War II. It refers to two incidents in which U.S. soldiers were involved in killing 71 unarmed Italian and 2 German prisoners-of-war at the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;″s 504 air base in Santo Pietro, a small village near Caltagirone, southern Sicily, Italy on 14 July 1943.

==Background==
As part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Seventh United States Army under Lieutenant General George S. Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Sir Bernard Montgomery invaded the southeast corner of the island on 10 July 1943. Immediately after landing, the US units headed for the airports located in the southern part of the island, and some massacres of civilians were reported; one happened in Vittoria, where 12 Italians died, including Giuseppe Mangano, podestà (mayor) of Acate, and his seventeen-year-old son Valerio, who was killed by a bayonet stabbed in his face.

As part of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley&#x27;s II Corps, the 45th Infantry Division was given a difficult task despite the fact that, of the divisions participating in the invasion, it was the only one to be &quot;green,&quot; with no previous combat experience. The 45th Division&#x27;s 157th and 179th Infantry Regiments were given the task of capturing several coastal towns and the Comiso Airport before they linked up with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division.

The 180th Infantry Regiment was given the task of capturing the Biscari airfield and linking up the US 1st Infantry Division. The 180th Infantry Regiment performed so poorly in the first 48 hours of the landing that Major General Troy H. Middleton considered relieving its commander. Instead, the assistant division commander was sent to exercise close supervision over the regiment.

During the capture of the Biscari airfield on 14 July 1943, troops of the 180th Infantry killed 71 Italian and two German POWs in two incidents. In the first incident 35 Italians and two Germans were killed, and 36 Italians were killed in the second incident.

== Massacre ==
===West incident===
On 14 July 1943, soldiers with the U.S. 180th Infantry Regiment were facing stiff enemy resistance near the Santo Pietro airfield, and by 10:00, they had taken a number of prisoners, including 45 Italians and 3 Germans. The executive officer for the 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry Regiment, Major Roger Denman, ordered a noncommissioned officer (NCO), Sergeant Horace T. West, 33 years old, to take that group of prisoners &quot;to the rear, off the road, where they would not be conspicuous, and hold them for questioning.&quot; The POWs were without shoes and shirts, which was a common practice to discourage escape attempts.

After Sergeant West, with several other U.S. soldiers assisting him, had marched the POWs about a mile, he halted the group and directed that eight or nine of them be separated from the rest and taken to the regimental intelligence officer (the S-2) for questioning. West then took the remaining POWs &quot;off the road, lined them up, and borrowed a Thompson submachine gun&quot; from the company first sergeant (the senior NCO in the company). When the First Sergeant asked West what he wanted it for, West responded that he was going to &quot;kill the sons of bitches.&quot; West then told the soldiers guarding the POWs to &quot;turn around if you don&#x27;t want to see it.&quot;

He then killed the POWs by shooting them with the submachine gun. When the bodies were discovered thirty minutes later, it was noted that each POW had been shot through the heart, which indicated that it had been close range. Investigators later learned that after West had emptied the Thompson into the group of POWs, he &quot;stopped to reload, then walked among the men in their pooling blood and fired a single round into the hearts of those still moving.&quot;

The next day, the 37 bodies caught the attention of a chaplain, Lieutenant Colonel William E. King. He reported the event to his senior officers, who at first dismissed it because of the bad press if it were to go public; however, after some convincing, they agreed to go to court for murder.

===Compton incident===
As commander of C Company, 1st Battalion, 180th Infantry Regiment, Captain John T. Compton landed south of the Acate River amidst sporadic mortar and small arms fire. Pursuing his first objective, he pushed his company towards Highway 115, joined with some 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers, and attacked several German positions. Compton did not sleep during the first three days of the invasion. He was simply &quot;too excited to sleep.&quot; On the fourth day, he managed about an hour and a half of sleep before the attack on the Biscari airfield. Around 23:00, C Company set off and reached the airfield around 1100 on 14 July 1943. Immediately they began to receive artillery, mortar, and sniper fire. The sniper fire was especially deadly. From a concealed position in a nearby draw, the snipers targeted wounded American soldiers as well as the medics attempting to aid them. Out of the 34 men in Compton&#x27;s 2nd Platoon, 12 were either wounded in action (WIA) or killed in action (KIA).

In an attempt to locate the snipers&#x27; firing position, Private Raymond C. Marlow crept down into a nearby draw. He had gone only about 25 yards into the draw before he spotted an Italian soldier with a rifle. Marlow raised his rifle and shouted at the Italian. The Italian ran away and entered a dugout farther in the draw. After a minute or two, the Italian soldier emerged with 35 others, several of whom were in civilian clothing. Marlow walked them up the hill to his outpost and reported to his squad leader, Sergeant Hair. &quot;I told him that I had gotten those fellows that were shooting at us while we were getting out from under that artillery fire,&quot; Marlow reported. Acting as an interpreter, Private John Gazzetti asked the prisoners if they had been acting as snipers. He got no response. Hair herded the prisoners out of the draw and asked 1st Lieutenant Blanks what he should do with them. Blanks, in turn, asked Compton for instructions.

Compton asked Blanks if he was sure that they were the same snipers that had been shooting at them all day. When Blanks answered in the affirmative, Compton said bluntly, &quot;Get them shot.&quot; Without hesitation, Blanks ordered Hair to assemble a firing squad and shoot the prisoners.

Compton accompanied the firing squad of about 11 men to the ridge overlooking the draw. He told the American soldiers to line up and they positioned themselves about six feet away from the prisoners. The prisoners started pleading for them not to shoot. Gazzetti, the interpreter, asked Compton if he had anything to say to the prisoners. Compton did not have anything that he wanted to ask them. Compton told the men to start firing on his order and stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want a man left standing when the firing was done.&quot; Seeing that their fate was sealed, a few of the prisoners began to run. The firing squad opened fire and killed all of the prisoners.

==Aftermath==
When he was informed of the massacres, General Omar Bradley told General George Patton on the morning of the 15 July 1943 that US troops had murdered some 50-70 prisoners in cold blood. Patton noted his response in his diary:

I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the Officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing can be done about it.

Bradley refused Patton&#x27;s suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division&#x27;s Inspector General found &quot;no provocation on the part of the prisoners... They had been slaughtered,&quot; Patton is reported to have said, &quot;Try the bastards.&quot;

The U.S. Army charged Sergeant Horace T. West for &quot;willfully, deliberately, feloniously, [and] unlawfully&quot; killing 37 prisoners of war in the first incident. At his trial, which began on 2 September 1943, West pleaded not guilty. Although he admitted the killings, his non-lawyer defense counsel raised two matters in his defense.

The first was he was &quot;fatigued and under extreme emotional distress&quot; at the time of the killings and was essentially temporarily insane at the time of the commission of the acts. However, First Sergeant Haskell Y. Brown testified that West had borrowed the Thompson and an additional magazine of 30 rounds and had appeared to act in cold blood.

The second defense raised by West&#x27;s counsel was that he was simply following the orders of his commanding general, who he testified had announced prior to the invasion of Sicily that prisoners should be taken only under limited circumstances. West&#x27;s regimental commander, Colonel Forrest E. Cookson, testified that the general had stated that if the enemy continued to resist after US troops had come within 200 yards of their defensive position, surrender of those enemy soldiers need not be accepted. The problems with that defense were that the prisoners-of-war had already surrendered, and the surrender had been accepted.

The court-martial panel found West guilty of premeditated murder, stripped him of his rank, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was detained in North Africa for fear that his presence in a federal penitentiary could bring unwanted publicity to him and to his crime. On reviewing West&#x27;s record of trial, Eisenhower decided to &quot;give the man a chance&quot; after he had &quot;served enough of his life sentence to demonstrate that he could be returned to active duty&quot;. After West&#x27;s brother wrote to the Army and his local US representative, it was decided to &quot;resolve the worrisome matter&quot; and on the recommendation of the War Department&#x27;s Bureau of Public Relations, the Deputy Commander of Allied Headquarters in Italy signed an order remitting West&#x27;s sentence on 24 November 1944. He was restored to active duty and continued to serve during the war at the end of which he received an honorable discharge. West died in Oklahoma in January 1974.

In regard to the second incident, Captain John T. Compton was also court-martialed and charged with the premeditated murder of 36 POWs under his charge. He also pleaded not guilty, and relying upon the &quot;respondeat superior&quot; legal doctrine, also defended his actions by claiming that he was merely following orders of his commanding general given in a speech to the officers in his division. On 23 October 1943 the court martial panel acquitted him, but the Judge Advocate&#x27;s review of the trial declared that in his opinion, Compton&#x27;s actions had been unlawful. Compton was transferred to the 179th Infantry Regiment and subsequently was killed in action on 8 November 1943 in Italy.

The commanding general named by both West and Compton was Patton. The War Department Inspector General&#x27;s office conducted an investigation into the killings, and in the course of the investigation General Patton was questioned about the alleged speech. Patton stated that his comments in the speech had been misinterpreted and nothing he had said &quot;by the wildest stretch of the imagination&quot; could have been taken as an order to murder POWs. The investigation ultimately cleared Patton of any wrongdoing.

<text>The General Confederation of Italian Industry (), commonly known as Confindustria, is the Italian small, medium, and big enterprises federation, acting as a private and autonomous chamber of commerce, founded in 1910. The association network is made of 222 associations, bringing together more than 150,000 companies of all sizes on a voluntary basis, accounting for around 5,400,000 individuals. It aims to help Italy&#x27;s economic growth, assisting, in doing so, its members. It is a member of the International Organisation of Employers (IOE). The President is Emanuele Orsini since 23 May 2024.

Confindustria was a founding member of several organizations, including ISTUD (Istituto Studi Direzionali) and Assingegneria (an organization set up by Confindustria, which has since merged with OICE, L&#x27;ingegneria italiana organizzata - which in itself belongs to Confindustria).

Members of Confindustria include ANIMA, the Federation of the Italian Associations of Mechanical and Engineering Industries.

It owns the prominent newspaper . With local chapters all over Italy, it is popularly synonymous with Italian business.

<doc id="714428" wikidata="Q424337" url="?curid=714428" title="Acute kidney injury">
<text>Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.

Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics.

The diagnosis of AKI is made based on a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms, along with lab tests for serum creatinine and measurement of urine output. Other tests include urine microscopy and urine electrolytes. Renal ultrasound can be obtained when a postrenal cause is suspected. A kidney biopsy may be obtained when intrinsic renal AKI is suspected and the cause is unclear.

AKI is seen in 10–15% of people admitted to the hospital and in more than 50% of people admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). AKI may lead to a number of complications, including metabolic acidosis, high potassium levels, uremia, changes in body fluid balance, effects on other organ systems, and death. People who have experienced AKI are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the future. Management includes treatment of the underlying cause and supportive care, such as renal replacement therapy.

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical presentation is often dominated by the underlying cause. The various symptoms of acute kidney injury result from the various disturbances of kidney function that are associated with the disease. Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Marked increases in the potassium level can lead to abnormal heart rhythms, which can be severe and life-threatening. Fluid balance is frequently affected, though blood pressure can be high, low, or normal.

Pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions (such as clotting of the kidneys&#x27; blood vessels or inflammation of the kidney). This is the result of stretching of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the kidney. If the kidney injury is the result of dehydration, there may be thirst as well as evidence of fluid depletion on physical examination. Physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the kidney problem, such as a rash in interstitial nephritis (or vasculitis) and a palpable bladder in obstructive nephropathy.

==Causes==
===Prerenal===
&quot;Prerenal&quot; causes of AKI (&quot;pre-renal azotemia&quot;) are those that decrease effective blood flow to the kidney and cause a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Both kidneys need to be affected as one kidney is still more than adequate for normal kidney function. Notable causes of prerenal AKI include low blood volume (e.g., dehydration), low blood pressure, heart failure (leading to cardiorenal syndrome), hepatorenal syndrome in the context of liver cirrhosis, and local changes to the blood vessels supplying the kidney (e.g. NSAID induced vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole). The latter include renal artery stenosis, or the narrowing of the renal artery which supplies the kidney with blood, and renal vein thrombosis, which is the formation of a blood clot in the renal vein that drains blood from the kidney.

===Intrinsic or intrarenal===
Intrinsic AKI refers to disease processes which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can be due to one or more of the kidney&#x27;s structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.

===Postrenal===
&quot;Postrenal&quot; AKI refers to acute kidney injury caused by disease states downstream of the kidney and most often occurs as a consequence of urinary tract obstruction. This may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, kidney stones, obstructed urinary catheter, bladder stones, or cancer of the bladder, ureters, or prostate.

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012, specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of AKI.

AKI can be diagnosed if any one of the following is present:
* Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours; or
* Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which has occurred within the prior 7 days; or
* Urine volume &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.

===Staging===
The &quot;RIFLE criteria&quot;, proposed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group, aid in assessment of the severity of a person&#x27;s acute kidney injury. The acronym RIFLE is used to define the spectrum of progressive kidney injury seen in AKI:

* Risk: 1.5-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease by 25 percent, or urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg per hour for six hours.
* Injury: Two-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 50 percent, or urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg per hour for 12 hours.
* Failure: Three-fold increase in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 75 percent, or urine output of &lt;0.3 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours, or no urine output (anuria) for 12 hours.
* Loss: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than four weeks.
* End-stage kidney disease: Complete loss of kidney function (e.g., need for renal replacement therapy) for more than three months.

===Evaluation===
The deterioration of kidney function may be signaled by a measurable decrease in urine output. Often, it is diagnosed on the basis of blood tests for substances normally eliminated by the kidney: urea and creatinine. Additionally, the ratio of BUN to creatinine is used to evaluate kidney injury. Both tests have their disadvantages. For instance, it takes about 24 hours for the creatinine level to rise, even if both kidneys have ceased to function. A number of alternative markers have been proposed (such as NGAL, HAVCR1, IL18 and cystatin C), but none of them are established enough as of 2018 to replace creatinine as a marker of kidney function.

These may include urine sediment analysis, renal ultrasound and/or kidney biopsy. Indications for kidney biopsy in the setting of AKI include the following:
# Unexplained AKI, in a patient with two non-obstructed normal sized kidneys.
# AKI in the presence of the nephritic syndrome.
# Systemic disease associated with AKI.
# Kidney transplant dysfunction.

In medical imaging, the acute changes in the kidney are often examined with renal ultrasonography as the first-line modality, where CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for the follow-up examinations and when US fails to demonstrate abnormalities. In evaluation of the acute changes in the kidney, the echogenicity of the renal structures, the delineation of the kidney, the renal vascularity, kidney size and focal abnormalities are observed. CT is preferred in renal traumas, but US is used for follow-up, especially in the patients suspected for the formation of urinomas. A CT scan of the abdomen will also demonstrate bladder distension or hydronephrosis.

===Classification===
Acute kidney injury is diagnosed on the basis of clinical history and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine, or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed oliguria (less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for at least 6 hours).
AKI can be caused by systemic disease (such as a manifestation of an autoimmune disease, e.g., lupus nephritis), crush injury, contrast agents, some antibiotics, and more. AKI often occurs due to multiple processes.

The causes of acute kidney injury are commonly categorized into &quot;prerenal&quot;, &quot;intrinsic&quot;, and &quot;postrenal&quot;.

Acute kidney injury occurs in up to 30% of patients following cardiac surgery. Mortality increases by 60-80% in post-cardiopulmonary bypass patients who go on to require renal replacement therapy. Preoperative creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dL, combined valve and bypass procedures, emergency surgery, and preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump are risk factors most strongly correlated with post-cardiopulmonary bypass acute kidney injury. Other well-known minor risk factors include female gender, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, insulin-requiring diabetes, and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Volatile anesthetic agents have been shown to increase renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), which causes retention of salts and water, diminished renal blood flow (RBF) and an increase in serum renin levels, but not in antidiuretic hormone (ADH).

==Treatment==
The management of AKI hinges on identification and treatment of the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a nephrologist. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, management of AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called nephrotoxins. These include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen, iodinated contrasts such as those used for CT scans, many antibiotics such as gentamicin, and a range of other substances.

Monitoring of kidney function, by serial serum creatinine measurements and monitoring of urine output, is routinely performed. In the hospital, insertion of a urinary catheter helps monitor urine output and relieves possible bladder outlet obstruction, such as with an enlarged prostate.

===Prerenal===
In prerenal AKI without fluid overload, administration of intravenous fluids is typically the first step to improving kidney function. Volume status may be monitored with the use of a central venous catheter to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.

If low blood pressure persists despite providing a person with adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase blood pressure (vasopressors) such as norepinephrine, and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart&#x27;s ability to pump (known as inotropes) such as dobutamine may be given to improve blood flow to the kidney. While a useful vasopressor, there is no evidence to suggest that dopamine is of any specific benefit and may in fact be harmful.

===Intrinsic===
The myriad causes of intrinsic AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or glomerulonephritis may respond to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.

The use of diuretics such as furosemide, is widespread and sometimes convenient in improving fluid overload. It is not associated with higher mortality (risk of death), nor with any reduced mortality or length of intensive care unit or hospital stay.

===Postrenal===
If the cause is obstruction of the urinary tract, relief of the obstruction (with a nephrostomy or urinary catheter) may be necessary.

===Renal replacement therapy===
Renal replacement therapy, such as with hemodialysis, may be instituted in some cases of AKI. Renal replacement therapy can be applied intermittently (IRRT) and continuously (CRRT). Study results regarding differences in outcomes between IRRT and CRRT are inconsistent. A systematic review of the literature in 2008 demonstrated no difference in outcomes between the use of intermittent hemodialysis and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) (a type of continuous hemodialysis). Among critically ill patients, intensive renal replacement therapy with CVVH does not appear to improve outcomes compared to less intensive intermittent hemodialysis. However, other clinical and health economic studies demonstrated that, initiation of CRRT is associated with a lower likelihood of chronic dialysis and was cost-effective compared with IRRT in patients with acute kidney injury.

===Complications===
Metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary edema may require medical treatment with sodium bicarbonate, antihyperkalemic measures, and diuretics.

Lack of improvement with fluid resuscitation, therapy-resistant hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or fluid overload may necessitate artificial support in the form of dialysis or hemofiltration. However, oliguria during anesthesia may predict AKI, but the effect of a fluid load is highly variable. Striving toward a predefined urine output target to prevent AKI is futile.

===Early recovery of AKI===
AKI recovery can be classified into three stages 1–3 on the basis of the inverse of the AKI KDIGO serum creatinine criteria.

==Prognosis==
===Mortality===
Mortality after AKI remains high. AKI has a death rate as high as 20%, which may reach up to 50% in the intensive care unit (ICU). Each year, around two million people die of AKI worldwide.

AKI develops in 5% to 30% of patients who undergo cardiothoracic surgery, depending on the definition used for AKI. If AKI develops after major abdominal surgery (13.4% of all people who have undergone major abdominal surgery) the risk of death is markedly increased (over 12-fold).

===Kidney function===
Depending on the cause, a proportion of patients (5–10%) will never regain full kidney function, thus entering end-stage kidney failure and requiring lifelong dialysis or a kidney transplant. Patients with AKI are more likely to die prematurely after being discharged from hospital, even if their kidney function has recovered.

The risk of developing chronic kidney disease is increased (8.8-fold).

==Epidemiology==
New cases of AKI are unusual but not rare, affecting approximately 0.1% of the UK population per year (2000 ppm/year), 20x incidence of new ESKD (end-stage kidney disease). AKI requiring dialysis (10% of these) is rare (200 ppm/year), 2x incidence of new ESKD.

Hot weather can increase the risk of AKI. For example, there is an increased incidence of AKI in agricultural workers because of occupational hazards such as dehydration and heat illness. No other traditional risk factors, including age, BMI, diabetes, or hypertension, were associated with incident AKI.

Acute kidney injury is common among hospitalized patients. It affects some 3–7% of patients admitted to the hospital and approximately 25–30% of patients in the intensive care unit.

Acute kidney injury was one of the most expensive conditions seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011, with an aggregated cost of nearly $4.7 billion for approximately 498,000 hospital stays. This was a 346% increase in hospitalizations from 1997, when there were 98,000 acute kidney injury stays. According to a review article of 2015, there has been an increase in cases of acute kidney injury in the last 20 years which cannot be explained solely by changes to the manner of reporting.

==History==
Before the advancement of modern medicine, acute kidney injury was referred to as &quot;uremic poisoning&quot; while uremia was contamination of the blood with urine. Starting around 1847, &quot;uremia&quot; came to be used for reduced urine output, a condition now called oliguria, which was thought to be caused by the urine&#x27;s mixing with the blood instead of being voided through the urethra.

Acute kidney injury due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) was recognized in the 1940s in the United Kingdom, where crush injury victims during the London Blitz developed patchy necrosis of kidney tubules, leading to a sudden decrease in kidney function. During the Korean and Vietnam wars, the incidence of AKI decreased due to better acute management and administration of intravenous fluids.

<text>Greg Evans (born November 13, 1947) is an American cartoonist and the creator of the syndicated comic strip &quot;Luann&quot;. He received the 2003 National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award for the strip. He has been nominated four other times for the same award.

==Career==
In &quot;100 Years of American Newspaper Comics&quot;, Dennis Wepman wrote that Evans &quot;taught junior and senior high school art in his native California, worked as promotion manager and graphic artist for a TV station in Colorado, and entertained with a robot at trade shows and fairs before he sold &quot;Luann&quot; to News America Syndicate in 1984.&quot;

Evans wrote a musical based on Luann, &quot;Luann: Scenes in a Teen&#x27;s Life&quot;, which debuted March 2008 at Palomar College in San Marcos, California. It was directed by Dana Case.

Prior to &quot;Luann&quot;, Evans published the comic strip &quot;Fogarty&quot;, distributed free to high school newspapers. It featured the character Mr. Fogarty, who continues in the same role as a character in &quot;Luann&quot;.

In 2005, Evans was awarded the Inkpot Award.

Evans is a graduate of California State University, Northridge.

==Personal life==
Evans lives in San Marcos, California, near San Diego. With his wife Betty he has three children, including daughter Karen, whose own experiences as a teenager influenced &quot;Luann&quot;. He also has two grandchildren. They are named Julie and Eric.

One of Evans&#x27; children, Rhonda, born around the time Evans had met his wife in college, was put up for adoption. 30 years later, Rhonda discovered that she was adopted. When reading the Sunday comics, she realized that an artist&#x27;s name matched the name on her adoption papers. She contacted Evans, who was shocked. Evans and his wife eventually met Rhonda, whose story was told in an episode of the PAX-TV series, &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;.

<text>Histopathology (compound of three Greek words: &#x27;tissue&#x27;, &#x27;suffering&#x27;, and &quot;-logia&quot; &#x27;study of&#x27;) is the microscopic examination of tissue in order to study the manifestations of disease. Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. In contrast, cytopathology examines free cells or tissue micro-fragments (as &quot;cell blocks

== Collection of tissues ==
Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. The tissue is removed from the body or plant, and then, often following expert dissection in the fresh state, placed in a fixative which stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is 10% neutral buffered formalin (corresponding to 3.7% w/v formaldehyde in neutral buffered water, such as phosphate buffered saline).

== Preparation for histology ==
The tissue is then prepared for viewing under a microscope using either chemical fixation or frozen section.

If a large sample is provided e.g. from a surgical procedure then a pathologist looks at the tissue sample and selects the part most likely to yield a useful and accurate diagnosis - this part is removed for examination in a process commonly known as grossing or cut up. Larger samples are cut to correctly situate their anatomical structures in the cassette. Certain specimens (especially biopsies) can undergo agar pre-embedding to assure correct tissue orientation in cassette &amp; then in the block &amp; then on the diagnostic microscopy slide. This is then placed into a plastic cassette for most of the rest of the process.

===Chemical fixation===

In addition to formalin, other chemical fixatives have been used. But, with the advent of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and diagnostic molecular pathology testing on these specimen samples, formalin has become the standard chemical fixative in human diagnostic histopathology. Fixation times for very small specimens are shorter, and standards exist in human diagnostic histopathology.

===Processing===
Water is removed from the sample in successive stages by the use of increasing concentrations of alcohol. Xylene is used in the last dehydration phase instead of alcohol - this is because the wax used in the next stage is soluble in xylene where it is not in alcohol allowing wax to permeate (infiltrate) the specimen. This process is generally automated and done overnight. The wax infiltrated specimen is then transferred to an individual specimen embedding (usually metal) container. Finally, molten wax is introduced around the specimen in the container and cooled to solidification so as to embed it in the wax block. This process is needed to provide a properly oriented sample sturdy enough for obtaining a thin microtome section(s) for the slide.

Once the wax embedded block is finished, sections will be cut from it and usually placed to float on a water bath surface which spreads the section out. This is usually done by hand and is a skilled job (histotechnologist) with the lab personnel making choices about which parts of the specimen microtome wax ribbon to place on slides. A number of slides will usually be prepared from different levels throughout the block. After this the thin section mounted slide is stained and a protective cover slip is mounted on it. For common stains, an automatic process is normally used; but rarely used stains are often done by hand.

=== Frozen section processing ===
An initial evaluation of a suspected lymphoma is to make a &quot;touch prep&quot; wherein a glass slide is lightly pressed against excised lymphoid tissue, and subsequently stained (usually H&amp;E stain) for evaluation under light microscopy.
The second method of histology processing is called frozen section processing. This is a highly technical scientific method performed by a trained histoscientist. In this method, the tissue is frozen and sliced thinly using a microtome mounted in a below-freezing refrigeration device called the cryostat. The thin frozen sections are mounted on a glass slide, fixed immediately &amp; briefly in liquid fixative, and stained using the similar staining techniques as traditional wax embedded sections. The advantages of this method is rapid processing time, less equipment requirement, and less need for ventilation in the laboratory. The disadvantage is the poor quality of the final slide. It is used in intra-operative pathology for determinations that might help in choosing the next step in surgery during that surgical session (for example, to preliminarily determine clearness of the resection margin of a tumor during surgery).

== Staining of processed histology slides ==
This can be done to slides processed by the chemical fixation or frozen section slides. To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast.

The most commonly used stain in histology is a combination of hematoxylin and eosin (often abbreviated H&amp;E). Hematoxylin is used to stain nuclei blue, while eosin stains the cytoplasm and the extracellular connective tissue matrix of most cells pink. There are hundreds of various other techniques which have been used to selectively stain cells. Other compounds used to color tissue sections include safranin, Oil Red O, congo red, silver salts and artificial dyes. Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. A commonly performed histochemical technique is the Perls&#x27; Prussian blue reaction, used to demonstrate iron deposits in diseases like Hemochromatosis.

Recently, antibodies have been used to stain particular proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Called immunohistochemistry, this technique has greatly increased the ability to specifically identify categories of cells under a microscope. Other advanced techniques include in situ hybridization to identify specific DNA or RNA molecules. These antibody staining methods often require the use of frozen section histology. These procedures above are also carried out in the laboratory under scrutiny and precision by a trained specialist medical laboratory scientist (a histoscientist). Digital cameras are increasingly used to capture histopathological images.

== Interpretation ==
The histological slides are examined under a microscope by a pathologist, a medically qualified specialist who has completed a recognised training program. This medical diagnosis is formulated as a pathology report describing the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols. In the removal of cancer, the pathologist will indicate whether the surgical margin is cleared, or is involved (residual cancer is left behind). This is done using either the bread loafing or CCPDMA method of processing. Microscopic visual artifacts can potentially cause misdiagnosis of samples. Scanning of slides allows for various methods of digital pathology, including the application of artificial intelligence for interpretation.

Following are examples of general features of suspicious findings that can be appreciated from low to high magnification on histopathology:

== In myocardial infarction ==

After a myocardial infarction (heart attack), no histopathology is seen the first ~30 minutes. The only possible sign the first 4 hours is waviness of fibres at border. Later, however, a coagulation necrosis is initiated, with edema and hemorrhage. After 12 hours, there can be seen karyopyknosis and hypereosinophilia of myocytes with contraction band necrosis in margins, as well as beginning of neutrophil infiltration. At 1 – 3 days there is continued coagulation necrosis with loss of nuclei and striations and an increased infiltration of neutrophils to interstitium. Until the end of the first week after infarction there is beginning of disintegration of dead muscle fibres, necrosis of neutrophils and beginning of macrophage removal of dead cells at border, which increases the succeeding days. After a week there is also beginning of granulation tissue formation at margins, which matures during the following month, and gets increased collagen deposition and decreased cellularity until the myocardial scarring is fully mature at approximately 2 months after infarction.

<text>The Wolf Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Wolf Foundation in Israel. It is one of the six Wolf Prizes established by the Foundation and awarded since 1978; the others are in Agriculture, Mathematics, Medicine, Physics and Arts.

The Wolf Prize in Chemistry is considered to be one of the most prestigious international chemistry awards, behind only the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Becoming a Wolf Prize laureate has been viewed as a potential precursor to receiving the Nobel Prize. As of 2022, 12 awardees have subsequently become Nobel laureates; the most recent of those is Carolyn Bertozzi, who received the Nobel Prize the same year.

<doc id="714449" wikidata="Q3161333" url="?curid=714449" title="James Pennethorne">
<text>Sir James Pennethorne (4 June 1801 – 1 September 1871) was a British architect and planner, particularly associated with buildings and parks in central London.

==Life==

===Early years===
Pennethorne was born in Worcester, and travelled to London in 1820 to study architecture, first under Augustus Charles Pugin and then under John Nash. Pennethorne&#x27;s father, Thomas was a first cousin of Nash&#x27;s wife.

In October 1824 he set off on a tour of France, Italy, and Sicily. At Rome he studied antiquities, and made a design for the restoration of the Forum, which he subsequently exhibited and was elected a member of the Accademia di San Luca.

On his return to London, at the end of 1826, he entered the office of John Nash, and, as his principal assistant, directed the West Strand, King William Street, and other important improvements, completing the Park Village East and Park Village West in Regent&#x27;s Park after Nash&#x27;s death.

Until 1840 Pennethorne engaged in some private practice, his works including the Bazaar, in St. James&#x27;s Street; Swithland Hall, Leicestershire; Dillington House, Ilminster; St. Julian&#x27;s (a house at Sevenoaks); and Christ Church, Albany Street. During this time he also began the work for the government, which would come to dominate his career. In 1832 he was directly employed by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to prepare plans for further improvements in the capital. One of his aims was to form a great street running from the extreme east to the extreme west of London, but this proved too ambitious for the government. However four streets were constructed to modified versions of his plans: New Oxford Street, Endell Street, Cranbourn Street and Commercial Street. In 1846 an act was obtained for the extension of Commercial Street from Spitalfields Church to Shoreditch, but this was not completed until 1858. In 1855 the newly formed Metropolitan Board of Works constructed Garrick Street, Southwark Street, Old Street to Shoreditch, and other thoroughfares from Pennethorne&#x27;s earlier designs.

===Public works===
After 1840 Pennethorne&#x27;s time was wholly absorbed by his work for the government. In that year he was appointed (with Thomas Chawner) joint surveyor of houses in London, in the land revenue department; in 1843 he became sole surveyor and architect of the Office of Woods, and was appointed a commissioner to inquire into the construction of workhouses in Ireland. The Museum of Practical Geology, which also housed the offices and laboratories of the Geological Survey was built to Pennethorne&#x27;s designs in 1847–9, on a long, narrow site with frontages in Piccadilly and Jermyn Street. It opened in 1851. In 1847 he drew up designs for the Public Record Office in Fetter Lane. A much modified version of the scheme was adopted in 1850, though only portions of it were ever built. In 1848 he modified Nash&#x27;s Quadrant in Regent Street, removing the colonnade and inserting a balcony and mezzanine story. In 1852 he worked on improvements to Buckingham Palace and the area between St. James&#x27;s Park and the Royal Mews. His works at the palace included the ballroom, supper-room, and connecting galleries. To the south of the palace he erected the Duchy of Cornwall office, the district post office, and other buildings. Between 1852 and 1856 he completed the west wing of William Chambers&#x27; Somerset House.

He was responsible for laying out Victoria Park in Tower Hamlets, Battersea Park, and prepared plans and estimates for a proposed &quot;Albert Park&quot; at Islington, which was never carried out.

In 1853 he drew up several different ambitious plans for the laying out of the estate owned by the Commissioners of the 1851 Exhibition at South Kensington, one of which included a relocated National Gallery. In the event the area was developed piecemeal, and Pennethorne&#x27;s contribution to the scheme, in his role as architect to the Office of Works, was a simple &quot;junction&quot; building containing offices and lecture theatre, linking the new iron museum buildings with existing structures, which had been adapted for use as an art school. He was one of the architects invited, in 1862, to submit designs for a memorial to Albert, Prince Consort, but his suggestion for a monument in the form of a Classical mausoleum was rejected in favour of George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s Gothic construction. Unbuilt plans commissioned from Pennethorne included designs for new public offices in Downing Street, and a new War Office intended to be built in Pall Mall.

His last work was for the University of London at 6 Burlington Gardens. The adjoining Burlington House, in Piccadilly, had been acquired by the government on his advice, to accommodate the learned societies removed from Somerset House, and the Royal Academy of Arts. The plans for the University of London were approved in 1866, but underwent some modification.

Pennethorne was knighted, in recognition of his public services, in November 1870.

His pupils included Henry Saxon Snell (1830–1904). His brother John Pennethorne (1808–1888) was also an architect.

He died on 1 September 1871 and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.
