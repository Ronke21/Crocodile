<text>In logic, linear temporal logic or linear-time temporal logic (LTL) is a modal temporal logic with modalities referring to time. In LTL, one can encode formulae about the future of paths, e.g., a condition will eventually be true, a condition will be true until another fact becomes true, etc. It is a fragment of the more complex CTL*, which additionally allows branching time and quantifiers. LTL is sometimes called &quot;propositional temporal logic&quot;, abbreviated &quot;PTL&quot;.
In terms of expressive power, linear temporal logic (LTL) is a fragment of first-order logic.

LTL was first proposed for the formal verification of computer programs by Amir Pnueli in 1977.

==Syntax==
LTL is built up from a finite set of propositional variables &quot;AP&quot;, the logical operators ¬ and ∨, and the temporal modal operators X (some literature uses O or N) and U. 
Formally, the set of LTL formulas over &quot;AP&quot; is inductively defined as follows:
* if then &quot;p&quot; is an LTL formula;
* if and are LTL formulas then , and are LTL formulas.

X is read as next and U is read as until.
Other than these fundamental operators, there are additional logical and temporal operators defined in terms of the fundamental operators, in order to write LTL formulas succinctly.
The additional logical operators are ∧, →, ↔, true, and false.
Following are the additional temporal operators.

* G for always (globally)
* F for finally
* R for release
* W for weak until
* M for mighty release

==Semantics==

An LTL formula can be &quot;satisfied&quot; by an infinite sequence of truth valuations of variables in &quot;AP&quot;.
These sequences can be viewed as a word on a path of a Kripke structure (an ω-word over alphabet 2&quot;AP&quot;).
Let &quot;w&quot; = a0,a1,a2... be such an ω-word. Let &quot;w&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;ai&quot;. Let &quot;w&quot;i = &quot;ai&quot;,&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1..., which is a suffix of &quot;w&quot;. Formally, the satisfaction relation ⊨ between a word and an LTL formula is defined as follows:
* &quot;w&quot; ⊨ &quot;p&quot; if &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;w&quot;(0)
* &quot;w&quot; ⊨ ¬ if &quot;w&quot; ⊭ 
* &quot;w&quot; ⊨ ∨ if &quot;w&quot; ⊨ or &quot;w&quot; ⊨ 
* if &quot;w&quot;1 ⊨ (in the next time step must be true)
* if there exists &quot;i&quot; ≥ 0 such that &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; ⊨ and for all 0 ≤ &quot;k&quot; &lt; i, &quot;w&quot;&quot;k&quot; ⊨ ( must remain true until becomes true)

We say an ω-word &quot;w&quot; satisfies an LTL formula when &quot;w&quot; ⊨ . 
The ω-language &quot;L&quot;() defined by is {&quot;w&quot; | &quot;w&quot; ⊨ }, which is the set of ω-words that satisfy .
A formula is &quot;satisfiable&quot; if there exist an ω-word &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;w&quot; ⊨ . 
A formula is &quot;valid&quot; if for each ω-word &quot;w&quot; over alphabet 2&quot;AP&quot;, we have &quot;w&quot; ⊨ .

The additional logical operators are defined as follows:
* → ≡ ¬ ∨ 
* true ≡ &quot;p&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;p&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;AP&quot;
* false ≡ ¬true
The additional temporal operators R, F, and G are defined as follows:
* R ≡ ¬(¬ U ¬) ( remains true until and including once becomes true. If never becomes true, must remain true forever. releases .)
* (eventually becomes true)
*G ≡ false R ≡ ¬F ¬ ( always remains true)

=== Weak until and strong release ===

Some authors also define a &quot;weak until&quot; binary operator, denoted W, with semantics similar to that of the until operator but the stop condition is not required to occur (similar to release). It is sometimes useful since both U and R can be defined in terms of the weak until:
* 

The &quot;strong release&quot; binary operator, denoted M, is the dual of weak until. It is defined similar to the until operator, so that the release condition has to hold at some point. Therefore, it is stronger than the release operator.

The semantics for the temporal operators are pictorially presented as follows.

==Equivalences==
Let φ, ψ, and ρ be LTL formulas. The following tables list some of the useful equivalences that extend standard equivalences among the usual logical operators.



==Negation normal form==

All the formulas of LTL can be transformed into &quot;negation normal form&quot;, where
* all negations appear only in front of the atomic propositions,
* only other logical operators true, false, ∧, and ∨ can appear, and
* only the temporal operators X, U, and R can appear.
Using the above equivalences for negation propagation, it is possible to derive the normal form. This normal form allows R, true, false, and ∧ to appear in the formula, which are not fundamental operators of LTL. Note that the transformation to the negation normal form does not blow up the length of the formula. This normal form is useful in translation from an LTL formula to a Büchi automaton.

==Relations with other logics==
LTL can be shown to be equivalent to the monadic first-order logic of order, FO[&lt;]—a result known as Kamp&#x27;s theorem— or equivalently to star-free languages.

Computation tree logic (CTL) and linear temporal logic (LTL) are both a subset of CTL*, but are incomparable. For example,
* No formula in CTL can define the language that is defined by the LTL formula F(G p).
*No formula in LTL can define the language that is defined by the CTL formulas AG( p → (EXq ∧ EX¬q) ) or AG(EF(p)).

== Computational problems ==
Model checking and satisfiability against an LTL formula are PSPACE-complete problems. LTL synthesis and the problem of verification of games against an LTL winning condition is 2EXPTIME-complete.

==Applications==

;Automata-theoretic linear temporal logic model checking
:LTL formulas are commonly used to express constraints, specifications, or processes that a system should follow. The field of model checking aims to formally verify whether a system meets a given specification. In the case of automata-theoretic model checking, both the system of interest and a specification are expressed as separate finite-state machines, or automata, and then compared to evaluate whether the system is guaranteed to have the specified property. In computer science, this type of model checking is often used to verify that an algorithm is structured correctly. 

:To check LTL specifications on infinite system runs, a common technique is to obtain a Büchi automaton that is equivalent to the model (accepts an ω-word precisely if it is the model) and another one that is equivalent to the negation of the property (accepts an ω-word precisely it satisfies the negated property) (cf. Linear temporal logic to Büchi automaton). In this case, if there is an overlap in the set of ω-words accepted by the two automata, it implies that the model accepts some behaviors which violate the desired property. If there is no overlap, there are no property-violating behaviors which are accepted by the model. Formally, the intersection of the two non-deterministic Büchi automata is empty if and only if the model satisfies the specified property.

;Expressing important properties in formal verification
:There are two main types of properties that can be expressed using linear temporal logic: safety properties usually state that &quot;something bad never happens&quot; (G¬&quot;&amp;varphi;&quot;), while liveness properties state that &quot;something good keeps happening&quot; (GFψ&quot; or G(&quot;&amp;varphi;&quot; →Fψ&quot;)). For example, a safety property may require that an autonomous rover never drives over a cliff, or that a software product never allows a successful login with an incorrect password. A liveness property may require that the rover always continues to collect data samples, or that a software product repeatedly sends telemetry data.

:More generally, safety properties are those for which every counterexample has a finite prefix such that, however it is extended to an infinite path, it is still a counterexample. For liveness properties, on the other hand, every finite path can be extended to an infinite path that satisfies the formula.

;Specification language
:One of the applications of linear temporal logic is the specification of preferences in the Planning Domain Definition Language for the purpose of preference-based planning.

==Extensions==
Parametric linear temporal logic extends LTL with variables on the until-modality.

<doc id="710326" wikidata="Q2352967" url="?curid=710326" title="Theory of criminal justice">
<text>The theory of criminal justice is the branch of philosophy of law that deals with criminal justice and in particular punishment. The theory of criminal justice has deep connections to other areas of philosophy, such as political philosophy and ethics, as well as to criminal justice in practice.

==Justice and criminal justice==

===Distinction from general justice===
Typically, legal theorists and philosophers consider four distinct kinds of justice: corrective justice, distributive justice, procedural justice, and retributive justice. Corrective justice is the idea that liability rectifies the injustice one person inflicts upon another (found in modern day contract law). Distributive justice seeks to appropriately distribute pleasure and pain between the offender and the victim by punishing the offender. Procedural justice focuses on the fairness in the processes that punish criminals. Retributive justice is perhaps best captured by the phrase &quot;lex talionis&quot; (the principle of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;), which traces back to the Code of Hammurabi. 

Criminal law generally falls under retributive justice, a theory of justice that considers proportionate punishment a morally acceptable response to crime. The principle of &quot;lex talionis&quot; received its most well known philosophical defense from Immanuel Kant. Criminal law is no longer considered a purely retributive undertaking; deterrence figures prominently in the justification of the practice and in the rules themselves.

<doc id="710328" wikidata="Q1000577" url="?curid=710328" title="Jarmo">
<text>Jarmo ( or , also &quot;Qal&#x27;at Jarmo&quot;) is a prehistoric archeological site located in modern Iraqi Kurdistan on the foothills of the Zagros Mountains. It lies at an altitude of 800 m above sea-level in a belt of oak and pistachio woodlands in the Adhaim River watershed. Excavations revealed that Jarmo was an agricultural community dating back to 7090 BC. It was broadly contemporary with other important Neolithic sites such as Jericho in the Southern Levant and Çatalhöyük in Anatolia.

== Discovery and excavation ==
The site was originally discovered by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities in 1940, and later became known to archaeologist Robert Braidwood from the University of Chicago Oriental Institute. At the time, he was looking for suitable places to research the origins of the Neolithic Revolution. Braidwood worked as part of the Iraq-Jarmo programme for three seasons, those of 1948, 1950–51 and 1954–55; a fourth campaign, to be carried out in 1958–59 did not come about because of the 14 July Revolution. During the excavations in Jarmo in 1954–55, Braidwood used a multidisciplinary approach for the first time, in an attempt to refine the research methods and clarify the origin of the domestication of plants and animals. Among his team were a geologist, Herbert Wright, a palaeo-botanist, Hans Helbaek, an expert in pottery and radio-carbon dating, Frederic Mason, and a zoologist, Charles Reed, as well as a number of archaeologists. The interdisciplinary method was subsequently used in all serious field work in archaeology.

== Jarmo, the village ==
The excavations exposed a small village, covering an area of 12,000 to 16,000 m2, and which has been dated (by carbon-14) to 7090 BC, for the oldest levels, to 4950 BC for the most recent. The entire site consists of twelve levels. Jarmo appears to be two older, permanent Neolithic settlements and, approximately, contemporary with Jericho or the Neolithic stage of Shanidar. The high point is likely to have been between 6,200 and 5,800 BC. This small village consisted of some twenty five houses, with adobe walls and sun-dried mud roofs, which rested on stone foundations, with a simple floor plan dug from the earth. These dwellings were frequently repaired or rebuilt. In all, about 150 people lived in the village, which was clearly a permanent settlement. In the earlier phases there is a preponderance of objects made from stone, silex—using older styles—and obsidian. The use of this latter material, obtained from the area of Lake Van, 200 miles away, suggests that some form of organized trade already existed, as does the presence of ornamental shells from the Persian Gulf. In the oldest level baskets have been found, waterproofed with pitch, which is readily available in the area.

== Agriculture and cattle farming ==
Agricultural activity is attested by the presence of stone sickles, cutters, bowls and other objects, for harvesting, preparing and storing food, and also by receptacles of engraved marble. In the later phases instruments made of bone, particularly perforating tools, buttons and spoons, have been found. Further research has shown that the villagers of Jarmo grew wheat of two types, emmer and einkorn, a type of primitive barley and lentils (it is common to record the domestication of grains, less so of pulses). Their diet, and that of their animals, also included species of wild plant, peas, acorns, carob seeds, pistachios and wild wheat. Snail shells are also abundant. There is evidence that they had domesticated goats, sheep and dogs. On the higher levels of the site pigs have been found, together with the first evidence of pottery.

== Pottery and religion ==
Jarmo is one of the oldest sites at which pottery has been found, appearing in the most recent levels of excavation, which dates it to the 7th millennium BC. This pottery is handmade, of simple design and with thick sides, and treated with a vegetable solvent. There are clay figures, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic, including figures of pregnant women which are taken to be fertility goddesses, similar to the Mother Goddess of later Neolithic cultures in the same region. These constitute the inception of the Art of Mesopotamia.

<text>Force-directed graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically-pleasing way. Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.

While graph drawing can be a difficult problem, force-directed algorithms, being physical simulations, usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity.

==Forces==
Force-directed graph drawing algorithms assign forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes of a graph drawing. Typically, spring-like attractive forces based on Hooke&#x27;s law are used to attract pairs of endpoints of the graph&#x27;s edges towards each other, while simultaneously repulsive forces like those of electrically charged particles based on Coulomb&#x27;s law are used to separate all pairs of nodes. In equilibrium states for this system of forces, the edges tend to have uniform length (because of the spring forces), and nodes that are not connected by an edge tend to be drawn further apart (because of the electrical repulsion). Edge attraction and vertex repulsion forces may be defined using functions that are not based on the physical behavior of springs and particles; for instance, some force-directed systems use springs whose attractive force is logarithmic rather than linear.

An alternative model considers a spring-like force for every pair of nodes formula_1 where the ideal length formula_2 of each spring is proportional to the graph-theoretic distance between nodes &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, without using a separate repulsive force. Minimizing the difference (usually the squared difference) between Euclidean and ideal distances between nodes is then equivalent to a metric multidimensional scaling problem.

A force-directed graph can involve forces other than mechanical springs and electrical repulsion. A force analogous to gravity may be used to pull vertices towards a fixed point of the drawing space; this may be used to pull together different connected components of a disconnected graph, which would otherwise tend to fly apart from each other because of the repulsive forces, and to draw nodes with greater centrality to more central positions in the drawing; it may also affect the vertex spacing within a single component. Analogues of magnetic fields may be used for directed graphs. Repulsive forces may be placed on edges as well as on nodes in order to avoid overlap or near-overlap in the final drawing. In drawings with curved edges such as circular arcs or spline curves, forces may also be placed on the control points of these curves, for instance to improve their angular resolution.

==Methods==
Once the forces on the nodes and edges of a graph have been defined, the behavior of the entire graph under these sources may then be simulated as if it were a physical system. In such a simulation, the forces are applied to the nodes, pulling them closer together or pushing them further apart. This is repeated iteratively until the system comes to a mechanical equilibrium state; i.e., their relative positions do not change anymore from one iteration to the next. The positions of the nodes in this equilibrium are used to generate a drawing of the graph.

For forces defined from springs whose ideal length is proportional to the graph-theoretic distance, stress majorization gives a very well-behaved (i.e., monotonically convergent) and mathematically elegant way to minimize these differences and, hence, find a good layout for the graph.

It is also possible to employ mechanisms that search more directly for energy minima, either instead of or in conjunction with physical simulation. Such mechanisms, which are examples of general global optimization methods, include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.

==Advantages==
The following are among the most important advantages of force-directed algorithms:
; Good-quality results: At least for graphs of medium size (up to 50–500 vertices), the results obtained have usually very good quality based on the following criteria: uniform edge length, uniform vertex distribution and showing symmetry. This last criterion is among the most important ones and is hard to achieve with any other type of algorithm.
; Flexibility: Force-directed algorithms can be easily adapted and extended to fulfill additional aesthetic criteria. This makes them the most versatile class of graph drawing algorithms. Examples of existing extensions include the ones for directed graphs, 3D graph drawing, cluster graph drawing, constrained graph drawing, and dynamic graph drawing.
; Intuitive: Since they are based on physical analogies of common objects, like springs, the behavior of the algorithms is relatively easy to predict and understand. This is not the case with other types of graph-drawing algorithms.
; Simplicity: Typical force-directed algorithms are simple and can be implemented in a few lines of code. Other classes of graph-drawing algorithms, like the ones for orthogonal layouts, are usually much more involved.
; Interactivity: Another advantage of this class of algorithm is the interactive aspect. By drawing the intermediate stages of the graph, the user can follow how the graph evolves, seeing it unfold from a tangled mess into a good-looking configuration. In some interactive graph drawing tools, the user can pull one or more nodes out of their equilibrium state and watch them migrate back into position. This makes them a preferred choice for dynamic and online graph-drawing systems.
; Strong theoretical foundations: While simple &quot;ad-hoc&quot; force-directed algorithms often appear in the literature and in practice (because they are relatively easy to understand), more reasoned approaches are starting to gain traction. Statisticians have been solving similar problems in multidimensional scaling (MDS) since the 1930s, and physicists also have a long history of working with related n-body problems - so extremely mature approaches exist. As an example, the stress majorization approach to metric MDS can be applied to graph drawing as described above. This has been proven to converge monotonically. Monotonic convergence, the property that the algorithm will at each iteration decrease the stress or cost of the layout, is important because it guarantees that the layout will eventually reach a local minimum and stop. Damping schedules cause the algorithm to stop, but cannot guarantee that a true local minimum is reached.

==Disadvantages==
The main disadvantages of force-directed algorithms include the following:
; High running time: The typical force-directed algorithms are in general &quot;considered&quot; to run in cubic time (formula_3), where formula_4 is the number of nodes of the input graph. This is because the number of iterations is estimated to be linear (formula_5), and in every iteration, all pairs of nodes need to be visited and their mutual repulsive forces computed. This is related to the N-body problem in physics. However, since repulsive forces are local in nature the graph can be partitioned such that only neighboring vertices are considered. Common techniques used by algorithms for determining the layout of large graphs include high-dimensional embedding, multi-layer drawing and other methods related to N-body simulation. For example, the Barnes–Hut simulation-based method FADE can improve the running time to be linearithmic, or formula_6 per iteration. As a rough guide, in a few seconds one can expect to draw at most 1,000 nodes with a standard formula_7 per iteration technique, and 100,000 with a formula_6 per iteration technique. Force-directed algorithms, when combined with a graph clustering approach, can draw graphs of millions of nodes.

; Poor local minima: It is easy to see that force-directed algorithms produce a graph with minimal energy, in particular one whose total energy is only a local minimum. The local minimum found can be, in many cases, considerably worse than a global minimum, which translates into a low-quality drawing. For many algorithms, especially the ones that allow only &quot;down-hill&quot; moves of the vertices, the final result can be strongly influenced by the initial layout, that in most cases is randomly generated. The problem of poor local minima becomes more important as the number of vertices of the graph increases. A combined application of different algorithms is helpful to solve this problem. For example, using the Kamada–Kawai algorithm to quickly generate a reasonable initial layout and then the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm to improve the placement of neighbouring nodes. Another technique to achieve a global minimum is to use a multilevel approach.

==History==
Force-directed methods in graph drawing date back to the work of , who showed that polyhedral graphs may be drawn in the plane with all faces convex by fixing the vertices of the outer face of a planar embedding of the graph into convex position, placing a spring-like attractive force on each edge, and letting the system settle into an equilibrium. Because of the simple nature of the forces in this case, the system cannot get stuck in local minima, but rather converges to a unique global optimum configuration. Because of this work, embeddings of planar graphs with convex faces are sometimes called Tutte embeddings.

The combination of attractive forces on adjacent vertices, and repulsive forces on all vertices, was first used by ; additional pioneering work on this type of force-directed layout was done by . The idea of using only spring forces between all pairs of vertices, with ideal spring lengths equal to the vertices&#x27; graph-theoretic distance, is from .

<text>The All-Australian team is an all-star team of Australian rules footballers, selected by a panel at the end of each season. It represents a complete team, including an interchange bench, of the best-performed players during the season, traditionally led by that season&#x27;s premiership coach.

Despite the name&#x27;s implication, the All-Australian team is usually ceremonial in modern times. Though the AFL played an All-Star match in 2020, it was the first in 12 years, and the difference in skill level between the All-Australian team and the nearest international competitor is currently too large for any contest to be competitive. Despite this, some of these players have represented Australia in AFL Academy junior teams up to the age of 18, as more than two-thirds of all AFL Academy representatives have gone on to play at senior AFL level.

From 1998 to 2004, the Australian international rules team was mainly composed of All-Australians, and from 2005 to 2013 the team for the annual International Rules Series was selected according to the quite different requirements of International rules football.

This change was reverted ahead of the 2014 series, with any player who had been selected at least once in &quot;any&quot; All-Australian team being eligible for selection.

== History ==
The earliest concept considered to be a precursor to the All-Australian team was an annual team selected by &quot;Sporting Life&quot; magazine between 1947 and 1955. A panel of sportswriters at the magazine selected a full team of eighteen from all ANFC-affiliated competitions. For a time, AFL historians considered these teams to be official All-Australian teams, but no longer recognises them as such.

The first official All-Australian team was selected in 1953, immediately after the Australian Football Carnival, which was held in Adelaide on that occasion. Based solely upon performances at the carnival, the All-Australian team was selected by representatives of the various state teams. This tradition continued at all subsequent interstate carnivals until 1988.

In 1991, following the VFL&#x27;s conversion to a national competition and its renaming as the Australian Football League (AFL), an annual All-Australian team based on performances during the AFL premiership season was introduced.

Since 1999, the All-Australian coach is the coach of the premiership-winning side that year.

Prior to 2007, only the final selections in the All-Australian team were announced. Since 2007, the All-Australian selection committee has nominated the 40 leading players of the year in their playing positions at the conclusion of the home and away season, before announcing the final 22 at a later date during the All-Australian Presentation Dinner. The squad was increased to 44 in 2022. The 2023 All-Australian selection panel consists of chairperson Gillon McLachlan, Kevin Bartlett, Eddie Betts, Jude Bolton, Nathan Buckley, Kane Cornes, Andrew Dillon, Glen Jakovich, Laura Kane, Cameron Ling, and Matthew Pavlich.

In addition to the senior All-Australian team, each year an All-Australian is announced based on the AFL National Under 18 Championships and the AFL National Under 16 Championships. The following lists are for senior teams only.

Members of the All-Australian team are awarded a team blazer, reminiscent of the formal wear traditionally worn by travelling members of national sports teams. Blazers have become synonymous with the identity of the honour.

====2008====

====2007====

Notes:
* For the first occasion, a preliminary squad of 40 was announced.
* With nine players selected, set a record for most players from one club in an All-Australian team, a record which stands to this day.

====2006====

Notes:
* Despite winning the Brownlow Medal and club best and fairest in a grand final year, Shane Woewodin was not selected in the team. Notably three Adelaide midfielders were selected despite that club missing the finals with a 9–13 win–loss record.

====1999====
Notes:

<text>Stenshuvud is a hill in the southeastern corner of Sweden, in the province of Scania, close to Kivik in Simrishamn Municipality. Since 1986, it is one of the National parks of Sweden. The park covers an area of about .

The hill is high and faces the Baltic Sea. Since the surrounding landscape is relatively flat, it can be seen from a great distance and has traditionally been used as a landmark for seafarers. Many visitors trek up the hill to enjoy the view which is very good in clear weather. The Stenshuvud National Park is traversed by a section of the Skåneleden Trail, between Simrishamn and Kivik. The trail ascends Stenshuvud, offering a diverse range of landscapes and views.

Most of the area is covered with broadleaf forest, especially European hornbeam. The park also contains heaths, meadows and swamps. Because of the mild climate and varied habitats, many different animal and plant species can be encountered in the park. The park contains unusual Swedish wildlife such as the hazel dormouse, Eurasian golden oriole, European tree frog and agile frog. There are about 600 vascular plant species, including several types of orchids and the very rare barren strawberry.

Below the hill there is a popular beach for swimming. Close to the top are the remains of a ruin of a 5th- or 6th-century fortress.

According to local folklore, the hill got its name (&quot;Sten&#x27;s head&quot;) from a giant living in the cave Giddastuan.

At the north of the hill is the Hällevik arboretum.

<doc id="710368" wikidata="Q3041889" url="?curid=710368" title="Endy Chávez">
<text>Endy de Jesus Chávez Meza (; born February 7, 1978), is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and Baltimore Orioles. Chávez is the older brother of Ender Chávez.

==Early life==
Chávez was born in Valencia, Venezuela where his father, Alirio, worked as a handyman. Growing up in Venezuela, he honed his hand-eye coordination by hitting pebbles out of the air with sticks. He initially drew attention from Colorado Rockies scouts at 18 years old but, when their interest wavered due to his slight stature, he signed with the New York Mets.

==Career==
===Minor league===
Chávez made his Minor League Baseball debut in 1997 with the Gulf Coast League Mets, a rookie-level affiliate of the New York Mets. He remained in the Mets organization through 2000, spending time with the Kingsport Mets, Gulf Coast Mets, Capital City Bombers, and St. Lucie Mets. On December 11, 2000, Chávez was claimed by the Kansas City Royals in the 2000 Rule 5 draft. On March 30, 2001, Chávez was returned to the Mets and then traded to the Royals for minor league outfielder Michael Curry. He played for the AA Wichita Wranglers and the AAA Omaha Royals before making his major league debut with the Royals on May 29, 2001.

===Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals===
In the winter of 2001, Chávez was waived by the Royals and then claimed and waived by both the Mets and Detroit Tigers before being claimed by the Montreal Expos where he played in 309 games over three years (2002–05) while splitting time at AAA Ottawa and Edmonton. Playing full-time for the Expos in 2003 and 2004, Chávez batted first in the lineup and started in center field, stealing 18 bases in 2003 and 32 in 2004. On October 3, 2004, Chávez recorded the final out in Expos history in their 8–1 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium. In 2005 Chávez played in only seven games in the majors for the now-relocated Washington Nationals before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for fellow outfielder Marlon Byrd. During his tenure in Washington, Chávez was given the mocking nickname of &quot;Inning Endy&quot; by Nationals fansites due to his tendency to swing away rather than work the count to his favor which often resulted in groundouts and popups to end the Nationals innings.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Chávez spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Philadelphia Phillies and appeared in 91 games with 107 at-bats and hit only .215. At the end of the season, Chávez became a free agent for the first time and signed one year, $500,000 contract with the Mets on December 23, 2005.

===New York Mets===

During spring training, Mets manager Willie Randolph worked with Chávez to improve his hitting. Chávez&#x27;s speed and his modified batting style sparked a 90-point jump in his batting average over the previous season (hitting .306 in 353 at-bats) as the Mets&#x27; fourth outfielder (often as an injury replacement for regular left fielder Cliff Floyd). His improved hitting and excellent defensive skills contributed to the Mets winning the National League East.
Chávez&#x27;s signature moment came at Shea Stadium in Game 7 of the 2006 National League Championship Series. In the top of the sixth inning, with the game tied, 1–1, Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen hit a pitch off Mets starter Óliver Pérez. Leaping over the left field wall, Chávez caught the ball with the tip of his glove to rob Rolen of a two-run home run. Chávez then threw to cutoff man second baseman José Valentín, who threw to Carlos Delgado at first base to double off Cardinals center fielder Jim Edmonds for an inning-ending double play. Although the Mets went on to lose the game and the series, &quot;The Catch&quot; was named the top post-season moment in the fifth annual This Year in Baseball Awards. On July 13, 2007, American International Group (the company whose left field advertisement was where Chávez made the catch) sponsored a special bobblehead doll day to commemorate the catch. The left field entrance gate of the Mets&#x27; current ballpark, Citi Field, features a metal silhouette of a baseball player making a leaping catch similar to the one Chávez made during the 2006 NLCS.

Chávez&#x27;s playing time decreased dramatically in 2007 when he only saw time in 71 games, primarily splitting time with regular left fielder Moisés Alou, due to left hamstring issues which landed him on the disabled list twice. That winter, he reinjured his hamstring and injured his right ankle while playing winter ball in Venezuela for Navegantes del Magallanes.

In 2008, Chávez again saw time as the Mets&#x27; fourth outfielder and hit .267 in 270 at-bats. On September 28, the final day of the 2008 regular season and the final game at Shea Stadium, the Mets played the Florida Marlins. With an NL wildcard spot at stake for the Mets, Chávez made another terrific catch in the outfield during the top of the seventh inning. After a ball was hit to left field by Jorge Cantú, Chávez made the catch for the final out of the inning. Despite his defensive play, the Mets lost to the Marlins 4-2 and failed to qualify for post-season play.

===Seattle Mariners===

On December 11, Chávez was involved in a three-team, 12-player trade in which he was sent, along with pitcher Aaron Heilman and several minor leaguers, to the Seattle Mariners.

On June 19, 2009, while trying to catch a pop-up, Chávez collided with shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt and suffered a torn ACL in his right knee which ended his 2009 season.

===Texas Rangers===
On February 15, 2010, Chávez agreed to a minor league free agent contract with the Texas Rangers and spent time with the Rangers&#x27; Rookie League team, the AA Frisco and AAA Oklahoma City while coming back from his ACL injury. In 2011, he batted .301 with 5 home runs in 256 at-bats and helped the Rangers to the 2011 World Series, which they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.

===Baltimore Orioles===

On December 18, 2011, Chávez signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. Chávez again saw major time on the disabled list (suffering intercostal muscle hamstring injuries) appeared in only 64 games, batting .203 with 12 RBIs and two home runs. On August 4, he was designated for assignment to make room for Nate McLouth and spent the next month with AAA Norfolk. He was recalled by the Orioles in mid-September.

===Seattle Mariners===
On December 31, 2012 Chávez signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals, but was released on March 22, 2013. On March 24, Chávez signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners and appeared in 97 games for the Mariners hitting .267.

===Bridgeport Bluefish===
On March 8, 2016, Chávez signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish, in the Atlantic League. Chávez was very successful in his first season with the Bluefish, batting .345 and winning the league batting title. In 95 games he hit .345/.397/.415 with 2 home runs, 37 RBIs and 5 stolen bases.

===Pericos de Puebla===
On March 9, 2017, Chávez signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League. In 93 games he hit .343/.397/.429 with 5 home runs, 59 RBIs and 1 stolen base. He was released before the start of the 2018 season on January 23, 2018.

===Somerset Patriots===
On February 26, 2018, Chávez signed with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He retired as an active player following the conclusion of the season. In 87 games he hit .287/.317/.330 with 2 home runs, 41 RBIs and 1 stolen base.

===Venezuelan Professional Baseball League===
Chávez played for 19 seasons in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League, all of them with Navegantes del Magallanes.

==Post-playing career==
===New York Mets===
In February 2019, Chávez returned to the Mets organization and was announced as a new coach for the Brooklyn Cyclones, the team&#x27;s Low–A affiliate. For the 2020 season, he was named the bench coach of the High–A St. Lucie Mets. Following the 2022 season, the Mets announced that they would not be bringing Chávez back as a minor league coach.

Chavez served as the first base coach for the Tiburones de La Guiara of the Venezuelan league, from the start of the 2023-24 winter ball season, through the 2024 Caribbean Series.

===Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos===
On January 8, 2024, Chávez was hired to serve as the hitting coach for the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos of the Mexican League. He was fired by the club on May 17.

==Personal life==
Chávez had a daughter, Joendys, with Joelis Molina on August 5, 2009 in Seattle. In the years following her birth, Chávez and Molina engaged in an international custody battle in the courts of Venezuela and the United States, ultimately concluding when Judge Jose L. Linares of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey ordered that Joendys be returned to her mother in Venezuela pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.

Chávez married his wife, Patrice, on September 15, 2015, in Emerson, New Jersey where the couple was then residing.

<text>Sutherland Shire is a local government area (LGA) in the southern region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Sutherland Shire is located approximately 26 kilometres south-southwest of the Sydney central business district, and comprises an area of . As at the , Sutherland Shire has an estimated population of . The area is colloquially known as &quot;The Shire&quot;, and has featured in several reality television series.

Geographically, it is the area directly to the south of Botany Bay and the Georges River. Sutherland Shire is south-southwest of the Sydney city centre, and is bordered by Bayside Council, City of Canterbury-Bankstown, City of Wollongong and the Georges River Council local government areas.

The administrative centre of Sutherland Shire is located in the suburb of Sutherland, with the council chambers located on Eton Street. As of 10 October 2024, the mayor of the Sutherland Shire is Cr. Jack Boyd, a Labor Party member.

Sutherland Shire contains what was the first landing site of Lieutenant James Cook, who went ashore onto what is now the suburb of Kurnell on 29 April 1770. It was originally intended to be the location of the first British Settlement, before Sydney Cove was chosen instead by Arthur Phillip of the First Fleet.

== History ==

=== Aboriginal history ===
The original inhabitants of the area of Sutherland Shire were some clans of the Dharawal people. Archaeological work in the Shire has revealed evidence for Aboriginal settlement dating back at least 8,500 years. The original coastline around Sydney has retreated about 20 km and that those flooded coastal plains may hold evidence showing occupation of this area going back well beyond the 8,500 years revealed in the 1966 Archaeological exploration.

Seashells became an important source of lime in the 1800s, and so, many middens in the Shire may have been mined for shells in order to produce mortar for construction.

Within the Royal National Park, field surveys have revealed many hundreds of Aboriginal rock shelters. In other locations (the military area near Holsworthy and Darkes Forrest) there are thousands of ancient campsites and sacred places. These areas mentioned have not been affected greatly by European settlement, and may give a clearer example of the quality of life and the abundance of resources in the Sutherland/Liverpool area.

Since 1966, when there was an archaeological dig in Cabbage Tree Basin, archaeologists have uncovered parts of an extensive open-air midden or cooking and camp sites. Successive layers of habitation show the diet of the native Aboriginal people: oysters, mussels, snapper, bream, and Sydney cockle. There is also evidence of seal, dolphin, a range of marsupials, dingo and even whale. Several edge-ground axes have also been found.

There are many places where paintings and engravings of great age show changes in art style over thousands of years. Some of these changes can be linked to the extinction of animals in the local area and to the arrival of Europeans. Some have interpreted these artistic changes to changes in culture and people which would indicate that there have been a number of changes of communities over time.

=== European settlement ===

European discovery of what is now Sutherland Shire was made by Lieutenant James Cook, who entered Botany Bay on 29 April 1770. Cook and his party explored around Kurnell Peninsula, and left the bay on 6 May. During their brief stay, a Scottish seaman named Forbes Sutherland died of tuberculosis. In his honour, Cook named the northwest point of the peninsula Point Sutherland.

The British government needed a new site for transported convicts as they had lost their American colonies following defeat in the American Revolutionary War. Botany Bay was chosen as the new penal settlement and the First Fleet under Governor Arthur Phillip anchored off Kurnell on 18 January 1788. After sending a party to clear land for settlement, Phillip soon realised the area was unsuitable. There was lack of shelter for ships, inadequate water and poor soil. On 24 January, two French ships were sighted off the coast, causing Phillip to raise English colours near Sutherland Point. Governor Phillip sailed north to explore Port Jackson, and eventually settled at Sydney Cove.

The first landowner in Sutherland Shire was James Birnie, a mercantile trader who was granted by promise at Kurnell in 1815. After the completion of official surveying, a large part of what is now Sutherland Shire was proclaimed as the Hundred of Woronora by Governor Richard Bourke in 1835. Title to land was not granted by the Crown until 1856, before which there was practically no settlement. Timber cutting was the primary industry, supplemented by shell gathering in the Port Hacking area.

With the opening of Crown Lands sales in the Sutherland Shire, Thomas Holt purchased . His developmental projects included oyster farms, cattle grazing, and coal mining. The investment which proved profitable however, were his timber leases. He constructed a magnificent manor on the foreshores of Sylvania, called Sutherland House, based on English feudal lines. Due to 99-year leases, Holt&#x27;s estate reduced development in the Sutherland Shire even into the 20th century.

=== Development of transport ===

The main mode of transport in the area was originally by water. Farmers&#x27; ships sailed up the coast into Botany Bay, and up the Georges and Woronora rivers, avoiding the wharfage and custom dues at Port Jackson. The first public road, the Illawarra Road (now called the Old Illawarra Road) to the &quot;Five Islands&quot; (now Wollongong), was constructed between 1842 and 1845 with convict labour. A new southern line of road was completed in 1864, linking up with the Illawarra Road at Engadine. Today this virtually is the line of the Princes Highway, the main north–south thoroughfare through Sutherland Shire.

A railway line was extended from Hurstville in 1884 to develop the rich Illawarra district. The railway brought into being firstly a huge shanty town on the heights of Como, and later developed the area into a holiday centre. Sutherland railway station was opened in 1885, named after John Sutherland, a Minister of Works during the 1870s who had argued most forcefully for the railway.
At this time, the greater part of the Sutherland Shire was connected only by access tracks. A road soon opened between the railway station and Cronulla Beach, catering mostly to families and fishing parties. This was followed by the Sutherland-Cronulla steam tram service, which was inaugurated in 1911. Not only did the service greatly increase the popularity of the Cronulla beaches, but it was of great advantage to the slowly developing business interests in the Sutherland Shire.

Increasing motor traffic caused a falling-off of passengers and the tram passenger service closed in 1931. The goods service ceased the following year. Increased road traffic with the north led to the opening of the first road bridge into the Shire, at Tom Ugly&#x27;s Point, in 1929. The six-lane Captain Cook Bridge over the Georges River, spanning Rocky Point and Taren Point, was opened in 1965, replacing the completely inadequate ferry service.

=== Residential development ===
Coastal and river frontage areas, such as Como, Illawong, Cronulla, Illawarra and Yowie Bay, became popular as country retreats. A form of voluntary local government was attempted in 1888, but law and order was still administered by the court at Liverpool until 1905. In that year, the provided that the whole of New South Wales be divided into shires. The State Governor, Harry Rawson selected the name, and proclaimed this district &quot;Sutherland, No. 133&quot; on 6 March 1906 and fixed the boundaries. At the time, Sutherland Shire had 1600 residents, and was divided into three ridings.

With only a small rates base, one of the early problems for the council was the provision of new roads. The construction of the Sutherland-Cronulla tramway by the Railways Commission went far in stimulating business activity and driving land sales. The population of Sutherland Shire increased from 2,896 in 1911, when the tramway opened, to over 7,500 in 1913. By 1931 the population had exceeded 12,000.

After the Second World War, the Housing Commission, under the auspices of William McKell, began acquiring land to build &quot;homes for heroes&quot;, including in the Shire. It was not until the early 1950s that this district of scattered dwellings, vacant blocks and quiet villages became a suburban area of Sydney. Until this time, Sutherland Shire was not considered part of the Sydney Urban Area, but was part of Metropolitan Sydney.

Associated with this growth of population was industrial, social and commercial development. The Sutherland Shire Libraries system was established in 1953 in a former doctor&#x27;s home at Sutherland with 8,000 books. The Captain Cook Drive from Caringbah to Kurnell was constructed in 1953 in conjunction with the establishment in 1956 of the Kurnell Refinery. In the suburb of Lucas Heights, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, which is now organised as the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), established its main research campus and its first nuclear reactor (HIFAR) in 1956. The reactor went critical on 26 January 1958, before shutting down and undergoing decommissioning in early 2007.

In terms of residential development, one of the most imaginative homebuilding concepts has been Sylvania Waters. In this community, individually designed family homes were built around a series of man-made canals. The urban release of land in the Menai district, to the west of the Woronora River, commenced in the 1970s.

=== Contemporary history ===

In January 1994, the 1994 Eastern seaboard fires destroyed parts of Como West, Jannali and Bonnet Bay; and affected the southern suburbs of Bundeena, Maianbar and Heathcote.

In the , Sutherland Shire was the second most populous local government area in New South Wales, and eighth in Australia overall.

In December 2005, following incidents at the Cronulla beaches culminating in an assault on a lifeguard by youth of Lebanese descent, an anonymous text message, publicised by major media outlets in Australia, called on people to gather at Cronulla beach on the following Sunday and attack &quot;wogs and lebs&quot;. On 11 December 2005 and the days that followed, a series of riots and retaliatory attacks broke out in Cronulla and other beach-side suburbs in Sydney&#x27;s east which saw numerous assaults. There were two non-fatal stabbings and property damage, especially to motor vehicles. There were many people arrested, over one hundred charged, and extensive national and international media interest.

The Sutherland Shire is home to a population of approximately 140 koalas, which are an endangered species.

== Heritage listings ==

*Woronora Dam (suburb): Woronora Dam

== Geography ==

Under the 1853 proclamation, the western boundary of district was the Woronora River. With the establishment of the Sutherland Shire on 6 March 1906, the western boundary was extended to take in more agricultural land in an area which is now modern day Menai. In 1919, the Illawong area was also transferred to the council. The Shire now has an area of , of which is state-designated national parkland.

The northern border of the Sutherland Shire can be crossed via four bridges: three road bridges (Alfords Point, Tom Uglys and Captain Cook) and the Como railway bridge. To the west, the Heathcote Road leading out of the Sutherland Shire passes by the Holsworthy military reserve. To the south, the Princes Highway runs out of Waterfall towards the City of Wollongong. The eastern border is bounded by the Tasman Sea.

In the eastern part the Sutherland Shire has a varying landscape of rugged sea cliffs and sandy beaches, and swampy bay coasts backed by sand dunes. To the west the surface consists of a broad plateau rising gently to the southwest, and cut into by several deep river gorges.

=== Geology ===

The geology of Sutherland Shire, whilst sharing characteristics with the North Shore, is very different from the western and central suburbs of Sydney. Above the coal-bearing rocks is found the Narrabeen Group, mostly made up of layers of sandstone and characteristic red claystone beds. Overlying the Narrabeen Group is the Hawkesbury Sandstone, the rock unit most characteristic of the Shire. Occasional patches of Ashfield shale overlay the Hawkesbury sandstone. Some time later than the Triassic period – possibly early Tertiary – minor volcanic activity occurred in the area . This took the form of intrusion of a number of dykes of basaltic rock which forced their way up through the sedimentary rocks. Due to the wetting and drying action of the weather the basaltic rock of the dykes has changed to clay.

From the end of the Triassic period to the middle of the Tertiary period, soft material was worn down or removed by wind and running water. In the final stages of this period of erosion the climate was apparently rather wetter and more humid than today&#x27;s, causing the exposed rocks to change and form laterite soil, which is abundant in the Sutherland Shire.

=== River system ===

A little later in the Tertiary, tilting occurred south of the Georges River. The slow uplift, taking perhaps several million years, formed the present Woronora Plateau, a surface which rises gently in the south. This process caused the river system in the Shire to flow in steeper watercourses. They then became more active, carving the steep gorges of Woronora, Hacking, Georges Rivers and their tributaries which can be seen today. Waterfalls such as those at Waterfall and Undola also formed during this period. Water supplies within the shire are of two kinds. The main source is the surface supply provided by the Woronora Dam, which is built in the deep gorge of Woronora River. A second source exists in the form of underground water.

During the last ice age, the rivers had to do additional work cutting down through the rocks to reach the lower and more distant ocean, leading to the &quot;valley-in-valley&quot; shape of many of the deep gorges in the Sutherland Shire. When sea levels rose again, the silt and sand carried by the rivers gradually built up a considerable thickness of sediment. Sediment filled the area between Kurnell (then an island) and Miranda. Sand dunes began to accumulate in the Kurnell area and the mud and sand flats of Quibray and Gunnamatta Bays began to form. The Kurnell sand dunes have provided a cheap source of sand for the southern suburbs of Sydney but in the process of exploitation this area has been robbed of its character and the removal of vegetation has opened the way to erosion.

=== Royal National Park ===

The Premier John Robertson dedicated to &quot;The National Park&quot; (now the Royal National Park), gazetted in 1879. This makes it the second oldest park of its kind in the world after Yellowstone National Park in America, although there is no public gazette record for Yellowstone until the 1880s, making a valid claim for The Royal National Park being the oldest in the world. In 1880 the Park was increased to . Today it is just under . The National Park was given the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; after Queen Elizabeth visited the park in 1954.

=== Urban structure ===
Sutherland Shire is now predominantly a residential area with commercial centres and minor industrial and rural areas. The commercial centres of the council are located in the suburbs of Sutherland, Miranda (home to Westfield Miranda), Cronulla, Caringbah, Menai and Engadine. Sutherland Shire&#x27;s old mantra was:
* Sutherland: &quot;The centre of business&quot;.
* Miranda: &quot;The centre of shopping&quot;
* Cronulla: &quot;The centre of leisure&quot;

The suburb of Kurnell, which includes the site of the first landing site of James Cook, was also the site of a former oil refinery. Nearby is Towra Point Nature Reserve, a wetland of international importance. Australia&#x27;s first and only nuclear reactor facilities are in the suburb of Lucas Heights. The reactor, run by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) is not a power station but is used for the production of radiopharmaceuticals, for research and irradiation.

The isolated suburbs of Bundeena and Maianbar are situated on the southern shore of Port Hacking between the water and the Royal National Park. They are accessible by boat, including a regular ferry service from Cronulla to Bundeena operated by Cronulla &amp; National Park Ferry Cruises or by road through the national park.

== Significant parks and reserves ==
* Botany Bay National Park
* Caravan Head Bushland Reserve
* Heathcote National Park
* Royal National Park
* Towra Point Nature Reserve
* Joseph Banks Native Plants Reserve, Kareela

== Facilities ==


=== Education ===

There are now nearly 100 schools in the Sutherland Shire including the Gymea and Loftus Colleges of Technical and Further Education, a technology high school (Gymea Technology High School), one of the ten academically selective high schools in New South Wales (Caringbah High School), a sports oriented high school (Endeavour Sports High School), more than twenty secondary schools, preschool centres, and special schools provided to serve children with specific learning needs.

=== Health ===

The Sutherland Hospital and Kareena Private Hospital are both located at Caringbah and President Private Hospital is located in Kirrawee.

=== Transport ===

The Sutherland Shire is serviced by Transit Systems and U-Go Mobility bus services and Sydney Trains services on the Illawarra line.

=== Emergency services ===

Fire and Rescue NSW has stations at Miranda, Sutherland, Cronulla, Engadine and Bundeena. The NSW Ambulance Service has stations at Caringbah (Sutherland Hospital), Engadine in the south and Menai in the west and Bundeena. Due to the large area designated as National Park and the prevalence of bushland in the area Sutherland Shire has 12 New South Wales Rural Fire Service stations. There are stations located at Bundeena, Engadine, Grays Point, Heathcote, Illawong, Kurnell, Loftus, Maianbar, Menai (currently relocating to Barden Ridge), Sandy Point, Waterfall and Woronora. These brigades attend fires, vehicle accidents, missing persons searches and community education days. Good coverage in the area from Fire and Rescue NSW also means that these Rural Fire Service members are regularly sent out of area to help the rest of New South Wales and on occasion interstate. The Sutherland Shire also has a State Emergency Service unit based at Heathcote with facilities at Menai and shared facilities at Woronora.

==== Surf life saving and river life saving ====

There are four surf life saving clubs, a surf life saving offshore rescue boat and Marine Rescue NSW base located at Cronulla and a river life saving club and Rural Fire Service and State Emergency Service boats located at Woronora. The clubs and boats provide life saving and first aid services to the many visitors to the Sutherland Shire&#x27;s beaches and rivers. The four surf clubs from south to north are: Cronulla SLSC, North Cronulla SLSC, Elouera SLSC and Wanda SLSC. The offshore rescue boat operated by the Cronulla District Lifesaver Rescue frequently assists in major marine rescues along the Sydney coast.

== Culture ==
Anthony Redmond claims the Shire has a reputation for insular localism that also manifests itself in surf culture, has a high conservative vote and is Sydney&#x27;s fourth largest Bible belt.

* The National Rugby League football club, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks are the major local professional sports team. They have an average attendance of 12,000-15,000.
* North Cronulla Surf Life Saving club doubled as a police station in the television series &quot;White Collar Blue&quot;.
* Southern Districts Rugby Club is the premier grade rugby union football club for the Sutherland Shire and are known as the &quot;Rebels&quot;. 
* The Sutherland Sharks Football Club is the Sutherland Shire&#x27;s New South Wales Premier League 1 Team in soccer. 
* Sutherland Shire Football Association is the largest Football Association in the Southern Hemisphere.
* The Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby Football League is the second-largest local rugby league competition in Sydney.

== Economy ==
According to a National Institute of Economic and Industry Research profile in 2016, the Gross Regional Product of the Sutherland Shire is estimated to be $9.74 billion, 1.9% of NSW&#x27;s Gross State Product.

=== Retail ===
The biggest commercial areas in the Sutheland Shire are located at Miranda, Menai, Sylvania, Kirrawee, Caringbah and Cronulla. Miranda is the main retail and commercial centre of the Sutherland Shire, being home to Westfield Miranda along with Lederer Miranda and Kiora Centre as the two nearby smaller shopping centres.

Southgate is another major shopping complex, located in Sylvania. Cronulla is also a popular retail and commercial centre, with numerous restaurants and cafes and a considerable number of surf stores and other clothing and fashion shops.

Other neighbourhood shopping centres have also developed at Bangor, Illawong, Kareela, Jannali, Yarrawarrah and Menai together with a small centre at Alfords Point. Gymea Shopping Village attracts many people, with a regional arts centre, Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre, and a cafe and restaurant scene.

=== Nuclear science ===
Since 1956, Sutherland Shire has been home to ANSTO’s Lucas Heights research campus, and the HIFAR, MOATA and OPAL nuclear reactors. In the past, ANSTO, then known as the AAEC, conducted scientific research into the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear medicine, and methods for enriching uranium. It is thought that this was to support Australia’s fledgling nuclear weapons program, which is assumed to have lasted from the Menzies government in the 1950s until the election of the Whitlam government in the early 1970s.

==Sister cities==

<text> (; abbreviated KAdm) is a senior naval flag officer rank in several German-speaking countries, equivalent to counter or rear admiral.

== Austria-Hungary ==

In the Austro-Hungarian &quot;K.u.K. Kriegsmarine&quot; (1849 to 1918) there were the flag officer ranks &quot;Kontreadmiral&quot; (also spelled &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; in the 20th century), &quot;Viceadmiral&quot; , &quot;Admiral&quot; and &quot;Großadmiral&quot;.

==Germany==
Konteradmiral, abbreviated KAdm or KADM, is the second lowest naval flag officer rank in the German Navy. It is equivalent to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in the &quot;Heer&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; or to &quot;Admiralstabsarzt&quot; and &quot;Generalstabsarzt&quot; in the &quot;Zentraler Sanitätsdienst der Bundeswehr&quot;.

===Rank insignia and rating===

The rank insignia, worn on the sleeves and shoulders, is a single five-pointed star above a single normal stripe and a wide stripe. The star is omitted on rank loops. &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; is a B7 grade in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence.

The sequence of ranks in decreasing seniority is:
*OF-9: &quot;Admiral&quot; / &quot;General&quot;
*OF-8: &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; / &quot;Generalleutnant&quot;
*OF-7: &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; / &quot;Generalmajor&quot;
*OF-6: &quot;Flottillenadmiral&quot; / &quot;Brigadegeneral&quot;

===History===
====Imperial German Navy and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;====
In the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; was an OF-6 one-star officer rank equivalent to a &quot;Heer&quot; or &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Generalmajor&quot;, and to an SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; and &quot;Generalmajor&quot; of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;.

The rank insignia consisted of shoulder strap and sleeve stripes. Shoulder straps had to be worn on uniform jackets and consisted of twisted gold-braids (no pips or stars) on padding in navy blue weapon color.

Cuff insignia consisted of one golden big stripe, one normal stripe, and a five-point naval star above. The sleeve rings encircled the lower cuffs.

The last surviving &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; &quot;Konteradmiral&quot;, Eberhard Godt, died at the age of 95 on 13 September 1995.

<doc id="710384" wikidata="Q7226991" url="?curid=710384" title="Polystick">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a polystick (or polyedge) is a polyform with a line segment (a &#x27;stick&#x27;) as the basic shape. A polystick is a connected set of segments in a regular grid. A square polystick is a connected subset of a regular square grid. A triangular polystick is a connected subset of a regular triangular grid. Polysticks are classified according to how many line segments they contain.

The name &quot;polystick&quot; seems to have been first coined by Brian R. Barwell.

The names &quot;polytrig&quot; and &quot;polytwigs&quot; has been proposed by David Goodger to simplify the phrases &quot;triangular-grid polysticks&quot; and &quot;hexagonal-grid polysticks,&quot; respectively. Colin F. Brown has used an earlier term &quot;polycules&quot; for the hexagonal-grid polysticks due to their appearance resembling the spicules of sea sponges.

There is no standard term for line segments built on other regular tilings, an unstructured grid, or a simple connected graph, but both &quot;polynema&quot; and &quot;polyedge&quot; have been proposed.

When reflections are considered distinct we have the &quot;one-sided&quot; polysticks. When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes, we have the &quot;free&quot; polysticks. Thus, for example, there are 7 one-sided square tristicks because two of the five shapes have left and right versions.



The set of &quot;n&quot;-sticks that contain no closed loops is equivalent, with some duplications, to the set of (&quot;n&quot;+1)-ominos, as each vertex at the end of every line segment can be replaced with a single square of a polyomino. For example, the set of tristicks is equivalent to the set of Tetrominos. In general, an &quot;n&quot;-stick with &quot;m&quot; loops is equivalent to a (&quot;n&quot;−&quot;m&quot;+1)-omino (as each loop means that one line segment does not add a vertex to the figure).

<doc id="710387" wikidata="Q137680" url="?curid=710387" title="Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts">
<text>Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts (&quot;née&quot; Burdett; 21 April 1814 – 30 December 1906) was a British philanthropist, the daughter of Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet and Sophia, formerly Coutts, daughter of banker Thomas Coutts. In 1837 she became one of the wealthiest women in England when she inherited her grandfather&#x27;s fortune of around £1.8 million () following the death of her stepgrandmother, Harriot Beauclerk, Duchess of St Albans. She joined the surnames of her father and grandfather, by royal licence, to become Burdett-Coutts. Edward VII is reported to have described her as &quot;[a]fter my mother, the most remarkable woman in the kingdom&quot;.

==Life==

Burdett-Coutts was widely known as &quot;the richest heiress in England&quot;. She was a collector of paintings, including Old Masters. Among the contemporary paintings she purchased was Robert Scott Lauder&#x27;s &quot;Christ Walking on the Sea&quot;. The Reverend Richard Harris Barham, in a ballad (part of the &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;) he wrote under the pen name &quot;Thomas Ingoldsby&quot; for Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation, referred to her as &quot;Miss Anja-ly Coutts&quot;. She became a subject of public curiosity, receiving numerous offers of marriage. She inherited the country house at Holly Lodge Estate in Highgate, which was then just outside London, where she was famous for holding receptions.

Burdett-Coutts spent part of each year at Ehrenberg Hall in Torquay with her former governess and later companion Hannah Brown, to whom she was devoted. When Brown died in 1878, Burdett-Coutts wrote to a friend that she was utterly crushed by the loss of &quot;my poor darling, the companion and sunshine of my life for 52 years&quot;. She was a friend of both Charles Dickens and the Duke of Wellington, and she proposed marriage to the Duke despite the great disparity in their ages.

Three years later, when she was 67, she shocked polite society by marrying her 29-year-old secretary, the American-born William Lehman Ashmead Bartlett, who became MP for Westminster on 12 February 1881. Her new husband changed his surname to Burdett-Coutts. Because of her husband&#x27;s American birth a clause in her stepgrandmother&#x27;s will forbidding her heir to marry a foreign national was invoked and Burdett-Coutts forfeited three-fifths of her income to her sister.

==Philanthropy==

Burdett-Coutts spent the majority of her wealth on scholarships, endowments, and a wide range of philanthropic causes. One of her earliest philanthropic acts was to co-found (with Charles Dickens) a home for young women who had &quot;turned to a life of immorality&quot;, including theft and prostitution. The home was known as Urania Cottage.

She avoided taking sides in partisan politics, but was actively interested in improving the condition of indigenous Africans, or the education and relief of the poor or suffering in any part of the world. Though she made no special distinction of creed in her charities, Burdett-Coutts was a notable benefactor of the Church of England, building two churches – including St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Rochester Row, Westminster – and endowing church schools. As executor of the will of the Reverend Chauncy Hare Townshend (the author of several volumes of poetry), she, with the Rev. Thomas Helmore (also a poet), used money from Townshend&#x27;s estate to build a primary school in Westminster, known as Burdett-Coutts &amp; Townshend Foundation Church of England Primary School.

She endowed the bishoprics of Cape Town and Adelaide (1847), and the founding bishopric of British Columbia (1857). The granite Greyfriars Bobby Fountain in Edinburgh, with a bronze statue of Greyfriars Bobby, was erected by Baroness Burdett-Coutts. She was involved with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Burdett-Coutts was influential in the formation of the RSPCA&#x27;s ladies committee in 1869 and was its first president.

In 1864, she financed the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem; the primary goal of the endeavour was to find better drinking water for those living in the city. During this work (1864–1865), the group, led by Charles William Wilson, was able to produce the most accurate and comprehensive map of Jerusalem but was unable to find a new source of water. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; commented that &quot;Charles Wilson’s work on the Jerusalem Ordnance Survey served as the basis for all future Jerusalem research&quot;. Burdett-Coutts subsequently helped fund other explorations in the Holy Land, sometimes in conjunction with the Palestine Exploration Fund. This effort included a subsequent offer to fund another exploration to find water for Jerusalem, to be led by Charles Warren.

Burdett-Coutts founded Columbia Market in 1869, in Bethnal Green in the East End of London, the district where much of her work was carried out. With her project in Columbia Square she became a pioneer in social housing. Through her support of missionary and nursing efforts she was associated with Louisa Twining and Florence Nightingale. Her small housing development, Holly Village, on the corner of what was then her estate, is now in private hands and may still be seen in Highgate. She was also the president of the British Goat Society.

In 1884, she was a co-founder of the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which became the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in 1889; she also founded the Westminster Technical Institute in 1893.

==Honours==
In 1871, in recognition of her philanthropic work, Queen Victoria conferred on her a suo jure peerage as Baroness Burdett-Coutts of Highgate and Brookfield in the County of Middlesex.

On 18 July 1872 she became the first woman to be presented with the Freedom of the City of London at the Guildhall, and in 1874 she became Edinburgh&#x27;s first woman Freeman and was also presented with the Freedom of that city.

A road in east London was named after her in 1862 and now forms part of the A1205 in Tower Hamlets.

==Death==
Lady Burdett-Coutts died of acute bronchitis at her home on Stratton Street, Piccadilly. By the time of her death she had given more than £3 million to good causes. Nearly 30,000 people filed past her coffin before she was buried on 5 January 1907 near the West Door in the nave of Westminster Abbey. She left no issue and the barony became extinct on her death. Preparations had been made to inter her ashes, but on the day of her funeral, Westminster Abbey unexpectedly received her uncremated body and was forced to bury her standing up.

A portrait of her is included in the mural of heroic women by Walter P. Starmer unveiled in 1921 in the church of St Jude-on-the-Hill in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London.

==Legacy==
Charles Dickens dedicated his novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; to her and she had many royal and eminent friends. The book &quot;Flashman&#x27;s Lady&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser makes reference to her (fictional) love for James Brooke (The White Rajah), and his rejection of her due to his physical affliction. She also puts a lecherous Flashman firmly in his place by dislocating his thumb. Angela Burdett-Coutts also features in Terry Pratchett&#x27;s novel &quot;Dodger&quot;; in an afterword, he states that part of his reason for writing the book was to bring Burdett-Coutts to the attention of modern readers. George Meredith wrote a poem, &#x27;Angela Burdett-Coutts&#x27;, in her memory. Angela Burdett-Coutts is also a main character in the novel &#x27;The Household&#x27; by Stacey Halls, published in 2024, which focuses on life at Urania Cottage and explores Burdett-Coutts&#x27; experience of being stalked by Richard Dunn for over a decade.

<text>Lewis Henry Lapham (March 13, 1858 – June 10, 1934) was an American businessman and entrepreneur who made a fortune consolidating smaller business in the leather industry. He was also one of the co-founders of the oil brand Texaco, Inc. (The Texas Company) then Texaco Oil Company.

==Biography==
Lapham was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Samantha Lapham (née Vail) and Henry Griffith Lapham, who were second cousins.

He built Waveny House in New Canaan, Connecticut, as a summer residence for his family to escape the heat of New York City. The mansion and property are now a public park and arts center in New Canaan.

Lapham was the husband of Antoinette N. Lapham (née Dearborn), the father of San Francisco mayor Roger D. Lapham (1883–1966), and Ruth Lloyd (née Lapham; 1896 – Darien, Connecticut, 8 October 1984), a singer and mother of seven children from her marriage including Samuel Lloyd, who died in 2017, the grandfather of actor Christopher Lloyd and banking executive Lewis A. Lapham (1909–1995), and the great-grandfather of both Lewis H. Lapham (1935-2024) and Sam Lloyd (1963–2020).

<text>Walter Stöhrer (1937–2000) was a German painter, graphic artist and academic teacher at the Berlin University of the Arts from 1986 until his death.

== Life and career ==
Born in Stuttgart on 15 January 1937, Stöhrer grew up in several places in the Black Forest, due to World War II, until the family settled in Karlsruhe. He was determined to become a painter early but was too young for formal studies. He was an apprentice in commercial graphical art from 1952 to 1954. In 1956 he began to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, first graphic art with Hans Gaenssken, and then painting in the class of HAP Grieshaber from 1957.

In 1959 Stöhrer left for Berlin where he lived and worked as a freelance artist. He became a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund, participating at its annual exhibitions in 1964 in Berlin and in 1971 in Stuttgart. Stöhrer became a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1984. Between 1981 and 1982 he was visiting professor at the Hochschule der Künste in Berlin (now the Berlin University of the Arts) where he became professor in 1986.

Stöhrer created abstract art, often inspired by literature such as works by André Breton and Rolf Dieter Brinkmann. When he moved to Berlin he first focused on etching, providing the elements of lines and gesture. He developed a combination of writing, drawing and painting. His works were exhibited in Europe and New York City.

Stöhrer died in Scholderup on 10 April 2000, at the age of 63.

== Awards ==
Stöhrer received awards including:
* 1962 German Youth Art Prize of Stuttgart
* 1964 Deutscher Kritikerpreis, Berlin
* 1971 , Berlin
* 1976 Berliner Kunstpreis
* 1977 Villa Romana Prize

* 1980 Prize of the Böttcherstraße in Bremen
* 1982 
* 1995 , Stuttgart
* 1999 of the HAP Grieshaber Foundation
* 2000 Kunstpreis der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Wirtschaft

The &quot;Walter Stöhrer-Stiftung&quot; (Walter Stöhrer-Foundation) is () working on an edition of his collected writings on art. It awards a prize in his name for graphic art students of the Berlin University of the Arts and the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart, alternating annually between the institutions. One of his paintings belongs to the Bundestag parliament.

<doc id="710404" wikidata="Q7226297" url="?curid=710404" title="Polydrafter">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a polydrafter is a polyform with a 30°–60°–90° right triangle as the base form. This triangle is also called a drafting triangle, hence the name. This triangle is also half of an equilateral triangle, and a polydrafter&#x27;s cells must consist of halves of triangles in the triangular tiling of the plane; consequently, when two drafters share an edge that is the middle of their three edge lengths, they must be reflections rather than rotations of each other. Any contiguous subset of halves of triangles in this tiling is allowed, so unlike most polyforms, a polydrafter may have cells joined along unequal edges: a hypotenuse and a short leg.

==History==
Polydrafters were invented by Christopher Monckton, who used the name &quot;polydudes&quot; for polydrafters that have no cells attached only by the length of a short leg. Monckton&#x27;s Eternity Puzzle was composed of 209 12-dudes.

The term &quot;polydrafter&quot; was coined by Ed Pegg Jr., who also proposed as a puzzle the task of fitting the 14 tridrafters—all possible clusters of three drafters—into a trapezoid whose sides are 2, 3, 5, and 3 times the length of the hypotenuse of a drafter.

==Extended polydrafters==
An &quot;extended polydrafter&quot; is a variant in which the drafter cells cannot all conform to the triangle (polyiamond) grid.
The cells are still joined at short legs, long legs, hypotenuses and half-hypotenuses.
See the Logelium link below.

==Enumerating polydrafters==

Like polyominoes, polydrafters can be enumerated in two ways, depending on whether chiral pairs of polydrafters are counted as one polydrafter or two.

With two or more cells, the numbers are greater if extended polydrafters are included. For example, the number of didrafters rises from 6 to 13. See .

<text>The Holly Lodge Estate is a housing estate in Highgate, north London.

==Early history==
Holly Lodge Estate is located on the site and grounds of a house built in 1798 by Sir Henry Tempest on the south-facing slopes of Highgate, London adjacent to Highgate Rise, now known as Highgate West Hill. The estate lands included Traitor&#x27;s Hill, reputedly where members of the Gunpowder Plot had met to watch the Palace of Westminster blow up, although the rumour is now known to be false. This &quot;villa&quot;, a term then used for a compact country house easily accessible to London, was later to be known as The Holly Lodge and in 1809 a young actress, Harriot Mellon, took over the lease on the property. She married the banker Thomas Coutts in 1815 and enlarged the house and grounds by buying adjacent properties. The grounds were landscaped by John Buonarotti Papworth in 1825. When Harriot Mellon died in 1837 she left the house and her fortune to her step-granddaughter.

Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts married late in life, and after her death her husband put the property on the market. Being four miles (6 km) from the City, it failed to sell and in 1907 was put on the market again, divided into several lots. It still failed to sell and it was not until 1922, after the death of her husband, that even outlying parts of the estate were sold: South Grove House and Holly Terrace to the North (the latter mostly unchanged in appearance since then) and Brookfield Stud to the south (now replaced by housing). Finally, in March 1923, the remaining portion of the estate, which was then always known as the Holly Lodge Estate, was sold for £45,000 and later resold to London Garden Suburbs Limited for the same price, with construction on the first street of homes, on Bromwich Avenue, beginning later that same year by the Central London Building Company Limited. The former lodge was demolished during the building of the new roads of houses and no trace of the building now remains, apart from a plaque at the entrance to the gardens taken from the north wall.

==Character of the Estate==
Initially, the plan was to build houses on the entire estate, creating a new housing estate, but due to slow sales and the need for drainage from the higher ground, the land to the east of the new central road was instead acquired by Lady Workers&#x27; Homes Limited to build blocks of rooms for single women moving to London in order to work as secretaries and clerks.

The local alderman and others involved in the project are commemorated in an inscription on the ornamental pond in the central garden area.

The estate now lies in a conservation area.
 and there has been a programme of regeneration.

===Private roads===
Built as an early gated community, the estate currently has two main access roads, the upper one to Highgate West Hill closing every night until mid-morning, the lower one to Swain&#x27;s Lane being closed randomly with access then controlled by estate staff. This maintains the private status of the estate roads and stops a right of way being created.

==Acquisition as social housing==
Ownership of the mansion blocks was transferred a number of times and, by the early 1960s under the ownership of Peachey Properties, many of the blocks were in a state of disrepair. The Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras took them over on a 150-year lease in 1964 which devolved to the London Borough of Camden the following year. Whilst Camden looks after the mansion blocks and the gardens in between the blocks, the remainder of the estate is managed and maintained by the Holly Lodge Estate Committee. The whole area remains a private estate and has been a Conservation Area since June 1992. Between 2004 and 2006 Sprunt Architects were responsible for a comprehensive programme of refurbishment works with the residents in occupation in which the exteriors of all the mansion blocks were renovated.

As the bedsitting rooms and flats in the Makepeace Avenue and Oakeshott Avenue mansion blocks were built without kitchens, a block was built at 30 Makepeace Avenue to serve as a centre for the community and included a restaurant, reading and meeting rooms and a small theatre. Behind it were three lawn tennis courts (with another two below Langbourne Avenue) where annual tennis tournaments were held.

Towards the late 1950s this community block fell into decline and by the time Camden bought their lease on the mansion blocks it was derelict. After a Lands Tribunal, the block with its unique facilities was demolished and a new building with 25 one-person flats for the elderly, together with some communal facilities, was constructed on the site. Minutes of the Council at the time state that the community facilities would be replaced in the new building; however, this failed to materialise and only a small community centre on the ground floor now serves the estate.

For many years Camden retained the policy of only placing women on the estate but that has since lapsed. The only known other estate built for single women was in Wandsworth but has since been demolished.

==Design==

Langbourne Mansions was built first and provided 88 self-contained flats which have changed little in the intervening years. The mansion blocks on Makepeace Avenue and Oakeshott Avenue though were designed from the outset as bed-sitting rooms, sometimes with bedroom or kitchen alcoves, and offered an acceptable way for single women to live near to London on their own. Only three flats in the whole of Makepeace Mansions and Holly Lodge Mansions had their own bathroom (one for a particular tenant, one for the caretaker and the remaining one for the stoker for the central boiler). The remainder all had shared bathroom and toilet facilities, which is still the case for seven of the blocks even today. Makepeace Mansions originally provided 269 rooms and Holly Lodge Mansions on Oakeshott Avenue had 408 flats but later conversions have seen this number reduced as bedsits have given way to self-contained flats. New regulations have seen a start on the conversion of the remaining bedsits to self-contained accommodation during 2005.

The design of the mansion blocks on each avenue follow the same design concept with variations from group to group. From a distance they appear as &#x27;Tudor Cliffs&#x27; as they tower above the adjoining houses and which is aided by the topography with not only the fall of the hill to the south but also to the east adjoining Highgate Cemetery.

The blocks are four or five stories in height and are united by timber details, gable roofs with finials, red tiles and casement windows usually with south-facing balconies. The rear and side elevations are in a very different plain and minimal style and overall reflect the modern design of the 1920s rather than the use of the vernacular.

<doc id="710415" wikidata="Q2391057" url="?curid=710415" title="Polyabolo">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a polyabolo (also known as a polytan or polytrong) is a shape formed by gluing isosceles right triangles edge-to-edge, making a polyform with the isosceles right triangle as the base form. Polyaboloes were introduced by Martin Gardner in his June 1967 &quot;Mathematical Games column&quot; in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

==Nomenclature==
The name &quot;polyabolo&quot; is a back formation from the juggling object &#x27;diabolo&#x27;, although the shape formed by joining two triangles at just one vertex is not a proper polyabolo. By false analogy, treating the di- in diabolo as meaning &quot;two&quot;, polyaboloes with from 1 to 10 cells are called respectively monaboloes, diaboloes, triaboloes, tetraboloes, pentaboloes, hexaboloes, heptaboloes, octaboloes, enneaboloes, and decaboloes. 
The name &quot;polytan&quot; is derived from Henri Picciotto&#x27;s name &quot;tetratan&quot; and alludes to the ancient Chinese amusement of tangrams.

==Combinatorial enumeration==
There are two ways in which a square in a polyabolo can consist of two isosceles right triangles, but polyaboloes are considered equivalent if they have the same boundaries. The number of nonequivalent polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, … triangles is 1, 3, 4, 14, 30, 107, 318, 1116, 3743, … .

Polyaboloes that are confined strictly to the plane and cannot be turned over may be termed one-sided. The number of one-sided polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, … triangles is 1, 4, 6, 22, 56, 198, 624, 2182, 7448, … .

As for a polyomino, a polyabolo that can be neither turned over nor rotated may be termed fixed. A polyabolo with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) corresponds to 8 distinct fixed polyaboloes.

A non-simply connected polyabolo is one that has one or more holes in it. The smallest value of &quot;n&quot; for which an &quot;n&quot;-abolo is non-simply connected is 7.

==Tiling rectangles with copies of a single polyabolo==

In 1968, David A. Klarner defined the &quot;order&quot; of a polyomino. Similarly, the order of a polyabolo P can be defined as the minimum number of congruent copies of P that can be assembled (allowing translation, rotation, and reflection) to form a rectangle.

A polyabolo has order 1 if and only if it is itself a rectangle. Polyaboloes of order 2 are also easily recognisable. Solomon W. Golomb found polyaboloes, including a triabolo, of order 8. Michael Reid found a heptabolo of order 6.
Higher orders are possible.

There are interesting tessellations of the Euclidean plane involving polyaboloes. One such is the tetrakis square tiling, a monohedral tessellation that fills the entire Euclidean plane with 45–45–90 triangles.
==Tiling a common figure with various polyaboloes==

The &quot;Compatibility Problem&quot; is to take two or more polyaboloes and find a figure that can be tiled with each.
This problem has been studied far less than the Compatibility Problem for polyominoes.
Systematic results first appeared in 2004 on Erich Friedman&#x27;s website Math Magic.

<doc id="710420" wikidata="Q3851235" url="?curid=710420" title="Polyhex (mathematics)">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a polyhex is a polyform with a regular hexagon (or &#x27;hex&#x27; for short) as the base form, constructed by joining together 1 or more hexagons. Specific forms are named by their number of hexagons: &quot;monohex&quot;, &quot;dihex&quot;, &quot;trihex&quot;, &quot;tetrahex&quot;, etc. They were named by David Klarner who investigated them.

Each individual polyhex tile and tessellation polyhexes and can be drawn on a regular hexagonal tiling.

==Construction rules==
The rules for joining hexagons together may vary. Generally, however, the following rules apply:
#Two hexagons may be joined only along a common edge, and must share the entirety of that edge.
#No two hexagons may overlap.
#A polyhex must be connected. Configurations of disconnected basic polygons do not qualify as polyhexes.
#The mirror image of an asymmetric polyhex is not considered a distinct polyhex (polyhex are &quot;double sided&quot;).

== Tessellation properties ==

All of the polyhexes with fewer than five hexagons can form at least one regular plane tiling. 

In addition, the plane tilings of the dihex and straight polyhexes are invariant under 180 degrees rotation or reflection parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the dihex (order 2 rotational and order 4 reflection symmetry), and the hexagon tiling and some other polyhexes (like the hexahex with one hole, below) are invariant under 60, 120 or 180 degree rotation (order 6 rotational and reflection symmetry).

In addition, the hexagon is a hexiamond, so all polyhexes are also distinct polyiamonds. Also, as an equilateral triangle is a hexagon and three smaller equilateral triangles it is possible to superimpose a large polyiamond on any polyhex, giving two polyiamonds corresponding to each polyhex. This is used as the basis of an infinite division of a hexagon into smaller and smaller hexagons (an irrep-tiling) or into hexagons and triangles.

== Enumeration==

As with polyominoes, polyhexes may be enumerated as &quot;free&quot; polyhexes (where rotations and reflections count as the same shape), &quot;fixed&quot; polyhexes (where different orientations count as distinct) and &quot;one-sided&quot; polyhexes (where mirror images count as distinct but rotations count as identical). They may also be distinguished according to whether they may contain holes. The number of free -hexes for  = 1, 2, 3, … is 1, 1, 3, 7, 22, 82, 333, 1448, … ; the number of free polyhexes with holes is given by ; the number of free polyhexes without holes is given by ; the number of one-sided polyhexes is given by ; the number of fixed polyhexes is given by .
=== Symmetry===
Of the polyhexes up to hexahexes, 2 have 6-fold rotation and reflection symmetry (thus also 3-fold and 2-fold symmetry), the monohex and the hexahex with a hole, 3 others have 3-fold rotation (the compact trihex, the propeller tetrahex and the hexahex looking like an equilateral triangle) and 3-fold reflection symmetry, 9 others have 2-fold rotation and reflection, 8 have just two fold rotation, 16 just have 2-fold reflection and the other 78 (most of the tetrahexes, pentahexes or hexahexes) are asymmetrical. The tilings of most of the reflection-symmetrical polyhexes are also invariant under glide reflections of the same order by the length of the polyhex.

=== Monohexes===

There is one monohex. It tiles the plane as a regular hexagonal tiling.

===Dihexes===
There is one free dihex:

===Trihexes===
There are 3 free and two-sided trihexes:

===Tetrahexes===
There are 7 free and two-sided tetrahexes. They are given names, in the order shown: bar, worm, pistol, propeller, arch, bee, and wave.

===Pentahexes===
There are 22 free and two-sided pentahexes:
===Hexahexes===
There are 82 free and two-sided hexahexes:

<doc id="710426" wikidata="Q1317394" url="?curid=710426" title="Polycube">
<text>A polycube is a solid figure formed by joining one or more equal cubes face to face. Polycubes are the three-dimensional analogues of the planar polyominoes. The Soma cube, the Bedlam cube, the Diabolical cube, the Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle, and the Conway puzzle are examples of packing problems based on polycubes.

==Enumerating polycubes==
Like polyominoes, polycubes can be enumerated in two ways, depending on whether chiral pairs of polycubes (those equivalent by mirror reflection, but not by using only translations and rotations) are counted as one polycube or two. For example, 6 tetracubes are achiral and one is chiral, giving a count of 7 or 8 tetracubes respectively. Unlike polyominoes, polycubes are usually counted with mirror pairs distinguished, because one cannot turn a polycube over to reflect it as one can a polyomino given three dimensions. In particular, the Soma cube uses both forms of the chiral tetracube.

Polycubes are classified according to how many cubical cells they have:

Fixed polycubes (both reflections and rotations counted as distinct ), one-sided polycubes, and free polycubes have been enumerated up to &quot;n&quot;=22. More recently, specific families of polycubes have been investigated.

==Symmetries of polycubes==
As with polyominoes, polycubes may be classified according to how many symmetries they have. Polycube symmetries (conjugacy classes of subgroups of the achiral octahedral group) were first enumerated by W. F. Lunnon in 1972. Most polycubes are asymmetric, but many have more complex symmetry groups, all the way up to the full symmetry group of the cube with 48 elements. There are 33 different symmetry types that a polycube can have (including asymmetry).

==Properties of pentacubes==
12 pentacubes are flat and correspond to the pentominoes. 5 of the remaining 17 have mirror symmetry, and the other 12 form 6 chiral pairs.

The bounding boxes of the pentacubes have sizes 5×1×1, 4×2×1, 3×3×1, 3×2×1, 3×2×2, and 2×2×2.

A polycube may have up to 24 orientations in the cubic lattice, or 48, if reflection is allowed. Of the pentacubes, 2 flats (5-1-1 and the cross) have mirror symmetry in all three axes; these have only three orientations. 10 have one mirror symmetry; these have 12 orientations. Each of the remaining 17 pentacubes has 24 orientations.

==Octacube and hypercube unfoldings==

The tesseract (four-dimensional hypercube) has eight cubes as its facets, and just as the cube can be unfolded into a hexomino, the tesseract can be unfolded into an octacube. One unfolding, in particular, mimics the well-known unfolding of a cube into a Latin cross: it consists of four cubes stacked one on top of each other, with another four cubes attached to the exposed square faces of the second-from-top cube of the stack, to form a three-dimensional double cross shape. Salvador Dalí used this shape in his 1954 painting &quot;Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)&quot; and it is described in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 short story &quot;And He Built a Crooked House&quot;. In honor of Dalí, this octacube has been called the &quot;Dalí cross&quot;. It can tile space.

More generally (answering a question posed by Martin Gardner in 1966), out of all 3811 different free octacubes, 261 are unfoldings of the tesseract.
==Boundary connectivity==
Although the cubes of a polycube are required to be connected square-to-square, the squares of its boundary are not required to be connected edge-to-edge.
For instance, the 26-cube formed by making a 3×3×3 grid of cubes and then removing the center cube is a valid polycube, in which the boundary of the interior void is not connected to the exterior boundary. It is also not required that the boundary of a polycube form a manifold.
For instance, one of the pentacubes has two cubes that meet edge-to-edge, so that the edge between them is the side of four boundary squares.

If a polycube has the additional property that its complement (the set of integer cubes that do not belong to the polycube) is connected by paths of cubes meeting square-to-square, then the boundary squares of the polycube are necessarily also connected by paths of squares meeting edge-to-edge. That is, in this case the boundary forms a polyominoid.
Every -cube with as well as the Dalí cross (with ) can be unfolded to a polyomino that tiles the plane.
It is an open problem whether every polycube with a connected boundary can be unfolded to a polyomino, or whether this can always be done with the additional condition that the polyomino tiles the plane.

==Dual graph==
The structure of a polycube can be visualized by means of a &quot;dual graph&quot; that has a vertex for each cube and an edge for each two cubes that share a square. This is different from the similarly-named notions of a dual polyhedron, and of the dual graph of a surface-embedded graph.

Dual graphs have also been used to define and study special subclasses of the polycubes, such as the ones whose dual graph is a tree.

<text>Abortion in Australia is legal. There are no federal abortion laws, though decriminalisation of the procedure has been enacted in all jurisdictions. Access to abortion varies between the states and territories: Surgical abortions are readily available on request within the first 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy in most jurisdictions, and up to 16 weeks in Tasmania. Later-term abortions can be obtained with the approval of two doctors, although the Australian Capital Territory only requires a single physician&#x27;s approval.

Since at least the 1980s, opinion polls have shown a majority of Australians support abortion rights, and that support for abortion rights is increasing. While anti-abortion violence is rare in Australia, anti-abortion activists have used tactics including &quot;verbal abuse, threats, and impeding entry&quot; outside abortion clinics. In response, all jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting protesters from harassing visitors and staff within a certain radius of abortion clinics, starting with Tasmania in 2013 and lastly with Western Australia in 2021.

A woman&#x27;s sexual partner is not required to be notified of an abortion, and Australian courts will not grant injunctions to prevent the procedure, even if the applicant is the putative father of the foetus. No waiting periods are imposed on having an abortion. A minor does not need to notify a parent of a proposed abortion, nor is parental consent required. While abortions are regulated by the states and territories, the procedure is partially funded under the federal government public health scheme, Medicare, or by private healthcare insurers.

==History==
Since colonisation, abortion in Australia has always been regulated by state (previously colonial) law. Before the end of the 19th century, each colony had adopted the Imperial &quot;Offences Against the Person Act 1861&quot;, which, in turn, was derived from English laws from 1837, 1828, and 1803, which made abortion illegal under any circumstance. Since then, abortion law has continued to evolve in each state by case law and changes in legislation.

A legal precedent concerning the legality of abortion was set in Australia in 1969, by the &quot;Menhennitt ruling&quot; in the Victorian Supreme Court case &quot;R v Davidson&quot;, which held that abortion was lawfully justified if &quot;necessary to preserve the physical or mental health of the woman concerned, provided that the danger involved in the abortion did not outweigh the danger which the abortion was designed to prevent&quot;. Since then, court rulings and legislative reform have helped deliver a medical framework for abortion in Australia; the Menhennitt ruling was later largely adopted by courts in New South Wales and Queensland, and was influential in some other states. Over time, this has come to be broadly defined so as to include the mental health of the woman, to which unwanted pregnancy is interpreted as clinically injurious.

Abortion rights received more attention over the 1970s across Australia, due, in part, to the efforts of many organisations and individuals such as the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA), Control Abortion Referral Service, and government initiatives such as the Royal Commission on Human Relationships, and activist medical practitioners such as Bertram Wainer.

===RU-486 controversy===
In the mid-1990s, the conservative Howard government was in power in Australia, with conservative independent Tasmanian Senator Brian Harradine holding the balance of power in the Senate. Howard brokered a deal with Harradine to ensure his support for proposed bills, including the privatisation of national telecommunications provider Telecom. In return, Harradine received support for introducing restrictions on abortion. As a result, unlike other medications, abortifacient drugs were made to require approval from the Minister for Health before they could be assessed by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). As TGA assessment is a requirement for drugs to be sold in Australia, this created a ministerial veto. Accordingly, the abortifacient RU-486, which was widely used overseas, was banned in Australia. The continued refusal by Tony Abbott, then Minister for Health, to allow abortifacients into Australia led to a private member&#x27;s bill being introduced in late 2005 to transfer the approval back to the TGA. The bill was subsequently passed as the &quot;Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial responsibility for approval of RU486) Act 2006&quot;. From 2006 to 2012, the drug was still not registered by the TGA, and medical practitioners needed special status from the TGA in order to prescribe it; even after registration, its use still has special conditions and restrictions. There is opinion among medical experts in Australia that abortifacients are over-regulated.

In 2006, after losing his veto power over abortifacients, Tony Abbott lobbied for funding of alternative counseling to pregnant women through church-affiliated groups to lower the national abortion rate, without success. In 2010, however, while he was seeking election as Liberal Party leader, Abbott pledged not to make any changes to abortion laws.

===Recent history and contemporary debate===
In 2017, Senator Cory Bernardi moved a motion to ban sex-selective abortion. The motion was voted down (10–36). There is no evidence that sex-selective abortions are common in Australia, though according to the Human Rights Law Centre, attempting to create bans on the procedure is a &quot;well-known tactic of opponents of abortion to limit women&#x27;s access to abortion&quot;.

The &quot;National Women&#x27;s Health Strategy 2020–2030&quot;, published by the Department of Health in 2019, listed &quot;equitable access to pregnancy termination services&quot; as a key measure of success for maternal, sexual and reproductive health.

Before the 2019 federal election, the Australian Labor Party unveiled a national abortion policy for the 2019 Australian federal election. The party&#x27;s policy included requiring public hospitals to offer abortion procedures consistently under new Commonwealth funding agreements, encouraging New South Wales to remove abortion from its criminal laws and building an abortion clinic in Tasmania. In response Liberal Party leader Scott Morrison stated the issue was controversial and sensitive and decisions should be left to the states. His Coalition colleagues were largely quiet on the matter, while anti-abortion groups including the Australian Christian Lobby and Cherish Life campaigned against Labor on the issue. Cherish Life claimed that Labor had an &quot;extreme late-term abortion agenda&quot;, and that &quot;more babies would die&quot; if they were elected. Labor MP Ed Husic, who retained his seat at the election, said the misrepresentation of the party&#x27;s abortion policy was a factor in his decrease in votes.

In October 2024, the South Australian Legislative Council narrowly voted down 10 to 9, a bill that would have seen those seeking a termination after 28 weeks to instead undergo an induced birth, with the babies then being adopted – effectively banning abortion at 28 weeks.

===Anti-abortion violence and protests===
Abortion-related violence is rare in Australia. The first serious attack and murder by an anti-abortion activist occurred in 2001, carried out by Peter Knight. Knight forced his way into a Melbourne clinic carrying a rifle, kerosene, and equipment to lock the doors of the clinic. He was intending to murder all patients and staff in the building, though he was overpowered after shooting and killing a security guard. Anti-abortion activists had been protesting outside the clinic, though left 15 minutes before Knight&#x27;s attack. Knight, described by the prosecution as a &quot;hermit obsessed with killing abortion doctors&quot;, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In January 2009, a firebombing using Molotov cocktails was attempted at a medical clinic in Mosman Park, Western Australia. Damage was minimal, and only resulted in smashed windows and blackened external walls. Police believed graffiti saying &quot;baby killers&quot; on the building was related to the attack; however, the medical clinic did not actually offer abortion services.

Since at least the 1990s, tactics used by anti-abortion campaigners outside abortion clinics included &quot;verbal abuse, threats, impeding entry to clinics, displaying violent imagery, and acts of &#x27;disturbing theater&#x27; such as pushing a blood-splattered doll in a pram&quot;. In response, states and territories began creating &quot;safe access zones&quot;, which prevent protesting about abortion within a proscribed area surrounding a clinic. Tasmania was the first state to do so in 2013. In April 2019, the High Court of Australia upheld these laws after they were challenged by two people arrested for violating them. The petitioners claimed their right to freedom of political communication had been denied as a result of the laws, though the court dismissed the appeals, saying the laws served a legitimate purpose. In August 2021, Western Australia became the last state to introduce safe access zones. In the months prior, patients at abortion clinics in that state were continuing to be approached and intimidated by protesters; footage was also obtained of anti-abortion campaigners protesting outside a Western Australian clinic at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite social distancing guidelines at the time. All jurisdictions have their exclusion zone at 150m around abortion clinics at all times, except for the Australian Capital Territory which may set a zone of 50m with approval from a health minister.

==Abortion laws==

===Federal involvement ===
Abortions are partially funded under Medicare, the federal government-funded public health scheme. As of 2015, Medicare effectively halved the cost of surgical abortion, and those provided by private healthcare insurers, which are also regulated by the federal government. The federal government also provides funding to public hospitals, and can thereby influence abortion policy and practice. Abortions and abortion advice are regarded as health services, and are exempt from the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

===Summary of state laws===


===Australian Capital Territory===
In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), references to abortion as a criminal offence were repealed by the &quot;Crimes (Abolition of Offence of Abortion) Act 2002&quot;. Before then, abortion law was for many years governed by case law under sections 82–84 of the &quot;Crimes Act 1900&quot; of New South Wales. Abortion care is now regulated under the framework of health law, standards, policies, and professional ethics that apply to all healthcare. There is no gestational limit preventing an abortion in the ACT.

Since March 2016, it has been an offence to protest within 50 m of an abortion clinic within the Australian Capital Territory (otherwise called &quot;protest free zones&quot;).

Since April 2023, abortion is free or at no cost for official Australian Capital Territory residents, a legal first for an Australian jurisdiction.

In June 2024, a bill passed in the ACT Assembly increasing abortion services by allowing nurses and midwives to prescribe abortion medication for the first time, in addition to doctors. The bill also introduced a requirement for health practitioners who refuse to provide abortion services to either refer patients to a practitioner that provides those services, or information on how to find one, bringing the ACT &quot;into line with other states and territories&quot; which had already required this.

===New South Wales===
Abortion was decriminalised in New South Wales on 2 October 2019 with the royal assent of the &quot;Abortion Law Reform Act 2019&quot;, passed a week earlier by both houses of the New South Wales parliament. The legislation took abortion out of the 119-year-old criminal code, and regulates it as a medical procedure. Under the new law, abortions are made available on request during the first 22 weeks of gestation. After that time, two doctors must agree that it is appropriate, based on the woman&#x27;s current and future physical, psychological, and social circumstances. This is similar to laws in other states and territories. The medical practitioner performing the abortion has an obligation to give appropriate medical care if the abortion results in a live baby being born.

Prior to the new law, abortion had been explicitly listed in New South Wales as a crime under sections 82–84 of the &quot;Crimes Act 1900&quot; (NSW) since 1900, but the interpretation of the law is subject to the &quot;Levine ruling&quot;, from &quot;R v Wald&quot; of 1971, itself derived from the Victorian Menhennitt ruling, which held an abortion to be legal if a doctor had an honest and reasonable belief that, due to &quot;any economic, social, or medical ground or reason&quot;, the abortion was necessary to &quot;preserve the woman involved from serious danger to her life or physical or mental health which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail&quot;. This was expanded by &quot;CES v Superclinics Australia Pty Ltd&quot; (1995), which extended the period during which health concerns might be considered from the duration of pregnancy to include the woman&#x27;s future health and well-being. In 2006, Dr. Suman Sood was convicted of two counts of performing an illegal abortion where she failed to enquire as to whether a lawful reason for performing the abortion did exist.

In June 2016, Greens upper house MP Mehreen Faruqi was to introduce a bill decriminalising abortion in NSW. However, on the eve of the introduction of the bill on 23 June 2016, it was removed from the order of business for the following day, despite being first in the order of precedence for months, scheduled and publicly announced.

In August 2016, Mehreen Faruqi released an exposure draft of the Abortion Law Reform (Miscellaneous Acts Amendment) Bill 2016 to &quot;Repeal sections 82–84 of the Crimes Act, relating to abortion offences; Provide for a 150 metre safe access zone around abortion clinics and service providers to ensure a patient&#x27;s right to medical privacy; and Require doctors to disclose conscientious objection at the start of the consultation and refer patients to another doctor who does not have such an objection or to the local Women&#x27;s Health NSW centre&quot;. The bill was introduced to the upper house on 11 August 2016. It was defeated in the second reading 25–14 on 11 May 2017.

Since 1 July 2018, it has been illegal to protest within 150 metres of an abortion clinic.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, abortion requires the approval of two doctors after 24 weeks&#x27; gestation. Surgical and medical abortion are available in the public health system. This is unusual in Australia where abortion services are frequently outsourced to private providers.

The Termination of Pregnancy Law Reform Act was enacted on 1 July 2017 and removed the need for two doctors to examine a woman before 14 weeks gestation, implemented a 150-metre &quot;safe access zone&quot; around clinics, removed the requirement of parental approval for the procedure and provided the ability for the prescription of medical abortion tablets. The Interpretive Report 2018 recorded 742 abortions in the previous 12 months with 73% being medical abortion with tablets before 9 weeks gestation, the remaining 27% were conducted in hospital. Since the legislative change, 99.33% of terminations of pregnancy were conducted under 14 weeks of gestation. This has also meant that the waiting time in a public hospital for a surgical termination has reduced which has policy and public health economic implications.

In December 2021, the Northern Territory eased restrictions on abortions, allowing access between 14 and 24 weeks with the approval of one doctor instead of the previous two required. They also legalised terminations after 24 weeks with the approval of two doctors, removing the previous provision which stated abortions were only legal after 24 weeks to save a woman&#x27;s life.

===Queensland===

Since 3 December 2018, abortion in Queensland has been available on request during the first 22 weeks of gestation. After that period, two doctors must sign off on the procedure before a woman can access an abortion unless there is a danger to the life of the woman or, in a multiple pregnancy, another foetus. Changes in the law followed campaigning by groups such as Fair Agenda who helped coordinate the lobbying of politicians, including via a rally and the use of a ‘vote pro choice’ web tool which showed politician&#x27;s positions on the issue and enabled messages to be sent to them. Following the success of the campaign Fair Agenda and others used similar tactics to gain reform in New South Wales and South Australia.

Prior to December 2018, abortion access in Queensland was determined by the 1986 &quot;McGuire ruling&quot;, which declared abortion to be legal if necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or health—beyond the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth—that would result if the pregnancy continued, and is not disproportionate to the danger being averted. Until 2008, abortion law in Queensland closely mirrored the law in Victoria. The &quot;McGuire ruling&quot; was affirmed in the 1994 case &quot;Veivers v. Connolly&quot;, by a single judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland.

===South Australia===
In South Australia, South Australian residents up to 23 weeks pregnant can have an early medication or surgical abortion. Safe access zones of 150 metres are provided around abortion clinics, effective since 1 January 2021.

Legislation in 1969 legalised abortion when necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the woman — taking into account the current and reasonably foreseeable future — or in cases when the child was likely to be born with serious handicaps. Abortions must be performed before a time limit of 28 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions must be performed in a hospital, and be approved by two physicians, and are also subject to a residency requirement (patient must be a resident of South Australia for at least two months). The hospital, dual approval, and residency requirement may be waived in an emergency. Abortions in South Australia are available for free or low cost at some of the public health facilities, including The Pregnancy Advisory Centre. This Pregnancy Advisory Centre is a registered hospital, with doctors available for approval. Both medical and surgical abortions are performed.

A bill decriminalising abortion was introduced into the state parliament in October 2020. Under the legislation, abortion can be performed upon request up to 22 weeks and six days gestation. After that period, a medical practitioner can only perform an abortion if they consult with another practitioner, and if both are of the view that the procedure is medically appropriate. The reform removed abortion entirely from the criminal code. The Legislative Council passed the bill on 3 December 2020, as did the House of Assembly on 19 February 2021, by 29 votes to 15. As an amendment banning so-called &quot;gender-selective abortion&quot; was passed by the Assembly, the amendments were agreed to by the Legislative Council on 2 March 2021, and received royal assent on 11 March 2021. The legislation required further regulations to be issued by the government, in order to come into effect. The government published the regulations on 23 June 2022; they came into effect on 7 July 2022. Health Minister Chris Picton criticised the former Liberal government, which was defeated by Labor at the March 2022 state election, for &quot;delay[ing] and bury[ing] these regulations, and failed to explain to the community why they did not progress them&quot;.

===Tasmania===
In Tasmania, since 21 November 2013, abortions are allowed on request up to 16 weeks of pregnancy. After 16 weeks abortion requires the consent of two doctors on medical or psychological grounds. The law also prohibits filming, the holding of protests, harassment, or intimidation of patients or staff within 150 metres of abortion clinics.

From 1925 until 2001, Tasmania&#x27;s Criminal Code prohibited &quot;unlawful abortion&quot;, without actually stating what was lawful or not. While it had never actually been prosecuted, it had been held that Victoria&#x27;s Menhennitt ruling of 1969 and New South Wales&#x27; Levine ruling applied in Tasmanian law. In late 2001, the Criminal Code was clarified to state that an abortion must be carried out under a set of criteria resembling those of the South Australian requirements.

The availability of abortion facilities in the state is limited. The state&#x27;s public health system provides abortion services in only extraordinary circumstances (e. g., in cases of foetal abnormality); so, most women access pregnancy terminations through the private sector. In 2017, the state&#x27;s only dedicated low-cost surgical abortion clinic closed. Some women chose to fly interstate for pregnancy terminations.

===Victoria===

In Victoria, since 2008, abortions are allowed on request up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions after that time requiring two doctors to agree that it is appropriate, based on the woman&#x27;s current and future physical, psychological, and social circumstances.

Before 2008, abortion law was based on the Victorian &quot;Crimes Act&quot;, as interpreted by the &quot;Menhennitt ruling&quot; in 1969, in the case of &quot;R v Davidson&quot;. Under the ruling, abortions were only legal if necessary to preserve the woman from a serious danger to her life or health — beyond the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth — that would result if the pregnancy continued, and is not disproportionate to the danger being averted. Menhennitt&#x27;s ruling remained the basis for abortion law in Victoria until the &quot;Abortion Law Reform Act 2008&quot; (Vic) decriminalised abortions up to a gestational limit of 24 weeks.

===Western Australia===
In Western Australia, from May 1998, abortions became legal on request (with a referral from a doctor) up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, though subject to counselling by a medical practitioner other than the one performing the abortion. After 20 weeks of pregnancy, abortions were only able to be performed if the foetus was likely to be born with severe medical problems, which needed to be confirmed by two independently appointed doctors. For girls under 16 years of age, one parent needed to be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children&#x27;s Court or when the child did not live with her parents.

In September 2023, progressive abortion reforms were made, which included fully removing abortion from the criminal code, removing the need for parental notification for minors, and reducing the number of doctors needed to approve most abortions from two to one. The need for mandatory counselling was also removed, and the time at which additional requirements for abortion apply was increased from 20 weeks gestation to 23 weeks. The changes came into effect on 27 March 2024.

Western Australia was the last jurisdiction in Australia not to have safe access zones. A bill to create safe zones within 150 metres of abortion clinics was formally passed in August 2021, and went into legal effect from 1 September on assent. A 2020 report by the Western Australian Department of Health found that 70% of people approved of safe access zones.

==Access to services==
In November 2024, it was revealed that several hospitals within NSW rural communities were explicitly denying women access to abortion by way of a &quot;self imposed regulation&quot;, forcing women to travel hours to either Sydney or Canberra to access abortion.

=== Telehealth services ===
With advancements in technology and the need for accessible healthcare services, telehealth has become a pivotal mode for providing abortion services across Australia. This approach allows women in remote, rural, and urban areas to access safe and legal abortion services, without the need for physical attendance in a healthcare facility.

==&quot;Child destruction&quot; laws==
Each state and territory has its own criminal code relating to child destruction. The offence is called &quot;killing unborn child&quot;, and can be committed only around the time of childbirth in Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. It is called &quot;causing death of child before birth&quot; in Tasmania. As of 2008, in South Australia, &quot;child destruction&quot; came under the heading of &quot;abortion&quot;. The definition is somewhat broader in the Australian Capital Territory, and comparably broad to English law in Tasmania and South Australia. The offence was abolished in Victoria by the Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 (Victoria).

New South Wales does not have a &quot;child destruction&quot; enactment, but the Crimes Amendment (Grievous Bodily Harm) Act 2005 (NSW) amended the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), so that s 4(1)(a) now defines &quot;grievous bodily harm&quot; as including &quot;the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm&quot;. This was further amended by the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 to &quot;the destruction (other than in the course of a medical procedure or a termination of a pregnancy in accordance with the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019) of the foetus of a pregnant woman, whether or not the woman suffers any other harm&quot;. In March 2022, NSW enacted &quot;Zoe&#x27;s Law&quot;, which created a new criminal offence for people who cause the loss of a foetus through a criminal act such as assault. The law explicitly states the new crime does not apply to abortion, or anything a woman does that results in the loss of her own foetus.

==Statistics==
There is a lack of consistent data collection standards across states due to differences in definitions, making it difficult or impossible to accurately quantify the number of abortions performed in Australia each year. There were an average of 75,700 Medicare-funded procedures that could result in an &quot;abortive outcome&quot; performed each year from 1995 to 2004, but this figure includes miscarriages as well as terminations. On the other hand, many women who have medical abortions performed at private hospitals may not claim the Medicare rebate.

South Australia is the only state which collects and publishes data on abortions. In 2002 there were 5147 medical abortions performed in South Australia, or 17.2 per 1000 women aged 15–44. Projected nationally, this would suggest that about 73,300 abortions were performed nationwide. This does not take into account differences between states. For example, unpublished data from Western Australia estimates a rate of 19.4 terminations per 1000 women in the same age bracket, which would indicate about 82,700 abortions projected nationally. The South Australian data also indicates that the vast majority of abortions performed between 1994 and 2002 occurred before 14 weeks gestation. Less than 2% took place at or after 20 weeks.

==Public opinion==
Traditional Christian beliefs played a large factor influencing Australia&#x27;s initial policies opposing abortion. Changing attitudes to abortion and reproductive rights have correlated with fewer Australians perceiving their country to be a &quot;Christian nation&quot;, which, in turn, has decreased the influence of right-wing Christian politicians. Stigma surrounding the issue of abortion, however, still remains, and can severely impact women&#x27;s sense of identity and mental health, and also influence whether an abortion is obtained. Women may choose to state they suffered a miscarriage, rather than telling people they had an abortion, to avoid negative reactions.

Since at least the 1980s, opinion polls have shown a majority of Australians support abortion rights, and that support for abortion rights is increasing.

* In 1973, the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby polled 5,267 men and women in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Canberra. The survey found 80% of people believed a woman should have a right to have an abortion.
* In 1987, a Saulwick poll found only about 7% of Australians would not approve of abortions under any circumstances.
* In 2003, a poll by The Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA) found that 81% of Australians believe a woman should have the right to choose an abortion, and only 9% believe they should not; 7% were &quot;neutral&quot;, and 2% could not decide.
* In 2005, a Nielsen Corporation poll found that 56% of Australians thought the abortion laws in place, which generally allow abortion for the sake of life, health, or economic factors, were &quot;about right&quot;, 16% want changes in law, to make abortion &quot;more accessible&quot;, and 17% want changes to make it &quot;less accessible&quot;.
* In 2006, a poll by Roy Morgan Research found that 65% of Australians approved of surgical abortion, and 22% disapproved; and that 62% believed RU-486 should be available to women, while 31% believed it should not.
* In 2006, interviews found that 80% of Australians disapproved the use of sex-selective abortion.
* In 2007, a poll by AuSSA found that 4% of Australians are opposed to abortion in all circumstances, 33% believe abortion should be allowed in certain circumstances, and 57% believed it should be readily available whenever a woman wants one; 7% were undecided, or did not respond.
* In 2009, a study of polls conducted during Australia&#x27;s 2007 federal elections found that a clear majority of both Labor Party and Liberal Party voters support abortion rights. The study also showed that 77 per cent of winning candidates in the 2007 election favoured an unrestricted approach to abortion.
* In 2010, a study published in &quot;The Medical Journal of Australia&quot; found that 61% of Australians said abortion should be lawful without question in the first trimester of pregnancy, while 26% said it should be lawful depending on the reason. In the second trimester and third trimesters, support for outright lawful abortion was 12% and 6%, respectively, while 57% and 42%, respectively, said it depended on the circumstances.

=== Indigenous perceptions ===
When abortion began to be legislated in 1969, some Indigenous Australians were among those opposing it, on the belief it would lead to &quot;coerced abortion and sterilization&quot;. This attitude is believed to have been influenced by previous government interference in Indigenous autonomy, including the Stolen Generations. As of the mid-2010s, more Indigenous women were choosing to have abortions, though stigmatisation around the issue is still prominent within many Indigenous communities.

<doc id="710446" wikidata="Q175881" url="?curid=710446" title="Roman Republic (1798–1799)">
<text>The Roman Republic () was a sister republic of the First French Republic that existed from 1798 to 1799. It was proclaimed on 15 February 1798 after Louis-Alexandre Berthier, a general of the French Revolutionary Army, had occupied the city of Rome on 11 February. It was led by a Directory of five men and comprised territory conquered from the Papal States. The Roman Republic immediately incorporated two other former-papal revolutionary administrations, the Tiberina Republic and the Anconine Republic. It proved short-lived, as Neapolitan troops restored the Papal States in October 1799.

==Background==
During the French Revolutionary Wars, the Papal States, under the temporal authority of the pope in Rome, was part of the First Coalition. After defeating the Kingdom of Sardinia early in the Italian campaign of 1796-1797, General Napoleon Bonaparte turned his attention south of Piedmont to deal with the Papal States. Bonaparte, skeptical over divided command for the invasion, sent two letters to the French Directory. The letters convinced the Directory to delay the invasion of the Papal States for a while. On 3 February 1797, the French defeated the pope&#x27;s army at the Battle of Faenza. Under the Treaty of Tolentino, signed on 19 February, Pope Pius VII was forced to accept an ambassador of the French First Republic.

On 27 December 1797, General Léonard Duphot, a military attaché at the French embassy in Rome, was killed while trying to defuse a riot in front of the embassy. After throwing himself between the rioters and papal troops, he was shot by the soldiers and later lynched by a mob in front of the Porta Settimiana. Duphot&#x27;s death led to the departure of the French ambassador, Joseph Bonaparte, and his entourage.

==History==
The Directory decided that Duphot&#x27;s killing would be avenged. The next year, French troops under General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded the Papal States and occupied Rome on 11 February 1798. Berthier proclaimed the Roman Republic on 15 February 1798, while Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner, escorted out of Rome on 20 February and exiled to France, where he later died. The institutions of the new sister republic were organized on the French model by Gaspard Monge and Pierre Daunou, with the help of local revolutionaries such as the engraver Francesco Piranesi and French residents of Rome such as .

On 24 February 1798, on the occasion of a ceremony for General Duphot, hundreds of French soldiers gathered in front of the Pantheon and addressed their grievances to generals Berthier and André Masséna, commander of the Army of Rome (&quot;Armée de Rome&quot;). The soldiers demanded the payment of salaries and the punishment of those responsible for looting during the invasion of the Papal States. Masséna refused to acknowledge the soldiers&#x27; demands, but after they stormed the Palazzo Ruspoli he committed to pay part of the soldiers&#x27; salaries within 48 hours and the rest within two weeks. At the same time, Berthier negotiated with the officers in revolt.

The next day, Masséna ordered the withdrawal of the French army to the other bank of the Tiber in order to disperse the military insurrection. However, a civilian uprising, quickly defeated, broke out in multiple districts of Trastevere. The officers then attempted to have Masséna dismissed. At the end of these two days of unrest, Masséna moved out of the city and Berthier left the Roman Republic. Claude Dallemagne, then provisional commander of Rome, found himself in charge of the city amid contradictory directives from Berthier and Masséna. New insurrections broke out on 2 March, when the officers refused to follow Masséna&#x27;s order for a transfer of troops. On the 14th of March, when the latter returned to Rome, the revolting officers called for his dismissal, his departure within 24 hours, and the granting of powers to Dallemagne while awaiting orders from the Directory.

New orders arrived in Rome on 18 March, indicating a strengthening of the authority of the civil commissioners, the transfers of Berthier to the Army of England and of Masséna to Genoa, and the attribution of powers in the city to General Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr with orders to arrest the officers involved in the insurrections.

The Kingdom of Naples invaded the Roman Republic in November 1798. Although initially victorious at Ferentino, the French evacuated Rome and a Neapolitan army entered the lightly guarded city unopposed on 29 November, the very day that the War of the Second Coalition had begun. Nevertheless, French troops led by General Jacques MacDonald, governor of the Roman Republic, and General Jean Étienne Championnet, commander of the Army of Rome, defeated the Neapolitans at Ferentino, at Civita Castellana on 5 December, and at Otricoli on 9 December, re-entering Rome on 14 December. Championnet would go on to occupy Naples in January 1799 and proclaim the Parthenopean Republic.

Following a second Neapolitan invasion on 30 September 1799, the Papal States were restored under the rule of Pope Pius VII in June 1800, bringing the Roman Republic to an end. The French Army invaded the Papal States again in 1808, after which it was partitioned between the First French Empire and the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815.

==Government==
The Roman Republic&#x27;s constitutional organization was heavily influenced by that of the French Constitution of 1795, which itself was inspired by and loosely based on that of the ancient Roman Republic. Executive authority was vested in five consuls. The legislative branch was composed of two chambers, a 60-member Tribunate and a 30-member Senate, which elected the consuls.

Northeast of the Cordillera Real are the &quot;Yungas&quot;, the steep eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains that make the transition to the Amazon River basin to the northeast. The capital of the department is the city of La Paz and is the administrative city and seat of government/national capital of Bolivia.
== Provinces ==

The Department of La Paz is divided into 20 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;) which are further subdivided into 85 municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and - on the fourth level - into cantons.

The provinces with their capitals are: 
==Government==
The chief executive office of Bolivia&#x27;s departments (since May 2010) is the Governor; before then, the office was called the Prefect, and until 2006 the prefect was appointed by the President of Bolivia and then the governor is elected by the voters. The current governor, Santos Quispe, was elected on 11 April 2021 and took office on 3 May.

Under the 2009 Constitution, Bolivian departments have an elected legislature, known as the Departmental Legislative Assembly. The La Paz Assembly has 45 members including five indigenous / natives minority representatives.

The most recent governor election results (2021) are as follows:

<text>Amoco Cadiz was an oil tanker owned by Amoco Transport Corp and transporting crude oil for Shell Oil. Operating under the Liberian flag, she ran aground on 16 March 1978 on Portsall Rocks, from the coast of Brittany, France. Ultimately she split in three and sank, resulting in the largest oil spill of its kind to that date.

==Oil spill==

On 16 March 1978 in a southwesterly gale, the &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; passed Ushant at the western tip of Brittany, headed for Lyme Bay in the United Kingdom. At 9:46 am when the supertanker was north of Ushant and west of Portsall she turned to avoid another ship and her rudder jammed, full over to port. Captain Bardari shut down the engine and attempted to make repairs, but they were not successful. Meanwhile, the wind began blowing from the northwest, driving the ship toward the coast. By the time the tugboat &quot;Pacific&quot; successfully attached a hawser, it was 2:00 pm and the &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; had drifted closer to the shore. For two hours, the tugboat struggled to slow the vessel&#x27;s drift, but then the towline parted. Captain Bardari turned his engines on full astern and this helped slow the ship&#x27;s drift. At 7:00 pm, the captain shut down the engines so that the &quot;Pacific&quot; could try to attach another hawser. The supertanker dropped one anchor, but the flukes broke off. At this point the supertanker was drifting at toward the Portsall Rocks. A new towline was successfully attached at 8:55 pm.

&quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; ran aground for the first time at 9:04 pm. She rode a high wave over a spire of rock which she then was impaled on. The rock cut through the plating of her bottom and thrust into the network of piping and machinery of the pump room as well as rupturing the rear wall of number-four cargo tank. The engine room flooded. She rolled and ground on the rock for about five minutes until another large wave lifted her off and she continued her southwesterly drift, pulling the &quot;Pacific&quot; after her.

The ship then drifted through the Portsall Rocks and at 9:30 pm she ran aground for the second time, on the Men Goulven rock from the shore. She hit the reef stern first and the bottom under the engine room was opened. She pivoted round to the port and stopped with her bow pointing toward land. She came to rest with her stern impaled on a rock about 12 metres under the surface and her bow on another six to seven metres deep. Between these rocks the depth was 25 to 30 metres. The &quot;Pacific&quot; had increased her towing speed, but shortly after 10:00 pm the second tow broke.

After the second grounding, the waves broke &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; into two parts held together by distorted metal on the port side. On 24 March the two parts were completely torn apart and the rear section swung 90 degrees around from pointing southwest to southeast. On 25 March she was close to breaking apart again, and by 28 March the wreckage was further moved around by the tides and waves.

By 29 March she had broken into three separate pieces and it was decided to destroy her with depth charges dropped from three Super Frelon helicopters. The Navy dropped twelve Mark 56 anti-submarine grenades, each containing of high explosives set to go off under water, and she sank 15 minutes later. Detonation of the charges was visible as huge water fountains and shook the ground ashore more than a mile away.

&quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; contained 1,604,500 barrels (219,797 tons) of light crude oil from Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia and Kharg Island, Iran. Severe weather resulted in the complete breakup of the ship before any oil could be pumped out of the wreck, resulting in her entire cargo of crude oil (belonging to Shell) and 4,000 tons of fuel oil being spilled into the sea. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that the total oil spill amounted to 220,880 tonnes of oil.

==Aftermath==
In 1988 a U.S. federal judge ordered Amoco Oil Corporation to pay $85.2 million in fines; $45 million for the costs of the spill and $39 million in interest. In 1992, Amoco agreed to pay $230 million (equivalent to $m in ).

The wreck is now frequently visited by leisure divers.

<doc id="710471" wikidata="Q1473449" url="?curid=710471" title="PGM-19 Jupiter">
<text>The PGM-19 Jupiter was the first nuclear armed, medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) of the United States Air Force (USAF). It was a liquid-propellant rocket using RP-1 fuel and LOX oxidizer, with a single Rocketdyne LR79-NA (model S-3D) rocket engine producing of thrust. It was armed with the W49 nuclear warhead. The prime contractor was the Chrysler Corporation.

The Jupiter was originally designed by the US Army, which was looking for a highly accurate missile designed to strike enemy states such as China and the Soviet Union. The US Navy also expressed an interest in the design as an SLBM but left the collaboration to work on their solid-fuel Polaris. Jupiter retained the short, squat shape intended to fit in submarines.

==Development history==

===Initial concept===
Jupiter traces its history ultimately to the PGM-11 Redstone missile, the US&#x27;s first nuclear ballistic missile. While it was entering service, Wernher von Braun&#x27;s Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) team at Redstone Arsenal began to consider an upgraded version using the LR89 rocket engine being developed by Rocketdyne for the Air Force&#x27;s Atlas missile project. Using the LR89 and adding a second stage would allow the new design to reach , a dramatic improvement over the Redstone&#x27;s roughly .

As Rocketdyne continued working on the LR89, it appeared that it could be improved to increase thrust over the promised . In 1954, the Army asked Rocketdyne to provide a similar design with a thrust of . During this same period, the weight of nuclear warheads was rapidly falling, and by combining this engine with a warhead of they could build a single-stage missile able to reach while being significantly less complicated and easier to handle in the field than a two-stage model. This engine was continually upgraded, ultimately reaching . This last model, known to the Army as the NAA-150-200, became much better known by its Rocketdyne model number, S-3.

===Navy SLBM interest===
Around the same time, the US Navy was looking for ways to join the nuclear club, and had been focusing mostly on cruise missiles and similar systems. Some consideration had been given to the use of ballistic missiles on ships, but Admiral Hyman Rickover, &quot;father&quot; of the nuclear submarine, was skeptical that this could be done, and was worried it would take up funding needed elsewhere. Another skeptic of missiles was the Chief of Naval Operations, Robert B. Carney.

Lower-ranking Navy officials became increasingly interested when the Army and Air Force began serious development of their long-range missiles. In an attempt to bypass high-ranking Navy officials, who remained uninterested in the concept, the Navy liaison to the Killian Committee championed the cause. The Committee took up the concept, and in September 1955 released a report calling for the development of a sea-based missile system.

The Navy&#x27;s interest in missiles had been greatly increased with the August 1955 appointment of Admiral Arleigh Burke to replace Carney. Burke was convinced the Navy had to get into the missile field as rapidly as possible, and was well aware that the Air Force would oppose any such endeavor. Instead, he approached the Army, and found that the proposed Jupiter fit the range goals needed by the Navy.

===Development begins===
The issue of who would be given the go-ahead to build an IRBM by this time had reached the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), who proved unable to reach a decision. This forced the Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson to move ahead without an official recommendation from the military. He saw the Navy interest as a reasonable argument to continue the Army project in any event, and on 8 November 1955 approved both programs. The Air Force would develop IRBM No. 1, or SM-75 (for &quot;strategic missile&quot;), the Army would develop their design as IRBM No. 2 or . The Navy would develop systems to launch the Army missile from ships and, later, submarines. BuShips completed a conceptual design that would take a Maritime Administration hull and convert it into a Jupiter missile launch ship, which was given the hull symbols YAG-58 then EAG-155; the conversion would later be canceled.

The requirement for shipboard storage and launching dictated the size and shape of the Jupiter. The original Army design was long and in diameter. The Navy stated they were not interested in anything longer than . The ABMA team responded by increasing the diameter to . This precluded it from being carried aboard contemporary cargo aircraft, limiting it to sea and road. Even with this change, they were unable to reduce its length enough to suit the Navy. They suggested that they begin with a long version and then scale it down as improvements in the engines were worked into the design. This was rejected, and after briefly considering a version, finally settled on the version.

On 2 December 1955, the secretaries of the Army and Navy publicly announced the dual Army–Navy program to create a land- and sea-based MRBM. In April 1956, as part of a widespread effort to assign names to various missile projects, the Army&#x27;s effort was given the name &quot;Jupiter&quot; and the Air Force&#x27;s became &quot;Thor&quot;.

===Accuracy and mission===
Redstone provided an accuracy of at its maximum range, which, when combined with its large warhead, allowed it to attack hard targets like protected airbases, bridges, command and control sites, as well as other strategic targets like railway marshaling yards and pre-attack concentration areas. This was in keeping with the Army&#x27;s view of nuclear weapons, which was in effect more powerful artillery. They saw the weapons as part of a large-scale battle in Europe, in which both sides would use nuclear weapons during a limited war that did not include the use of strategic weapons on each other&#x27;s cities. In that case, &quot;if wars were to be kept limited, such weapons would have to be capable of hitting only tactical targets.&quot; This approach saw the support of a number of influential theorists, notably Henry Kissinger, and was seized on as a uniquely Army mission.

The original goal for the new longer-range design was to match Redstone&#x27;s accuracy at the Jupiter&#x27;s much-extended range. That is, if Redstone could reach at , the new design would provide a circular error probable on the order of . As development continued, it became clear the ABMA team, under the direction of Fritz Mueller, could improve on that. This led to a period in which &quot;The Army would lay down a particular accuracy, and wait for our arguments whether it was possible. We had to promise a lot, but were fortunate.&quot;

This process ultimately delivered a superior design intended to provide accuracy at the full range, an order of magnitude better than Redstone and four times better than the best INS designs being used by the Air Force. The system was so accurate that a number of observers expressed their skepticism about the Army&#x27;s goals, with the WSEG suggesting they were hopelessly optimistic.

The Air Force was dead set against Jupiter. They argued that nuclear weapons were not simply new artillery, and that their employment would immediately trigger a response that might result in a strategic exchange. This would especially be true if the Army launched a long-range weapon like Jupiter, which could reach cities in the Soviet Union and could not immediately be distinguished as attacking a military or civilian target. They suggested that any such launch would trigger a strategic response, and as such, the Army should not be given any long-range weapons.

However, as von Braun&#x27;s team went from success to success, and with Atlas still years from operational deployment, it was clear that Jupiter represented a threat to the Air Force&#x27;s desired hegemony over strategic forces. This led to them starting their own MRBM program Thor, in spite of having repeatedly dismissed the medium-range role in the past. The fighting between the Army and Air Force grew through 1955 and 1956 until practically every missile system the Army was involved in was being attacked in the press.

===Navy exit===
The Navy was concerned from the start about Jupiter&#x27;s cryogenic propellants, but at the time there was no other option. Given the size and weight of contemporary nuclear weapons, only a large liquid-fuel rocket engine provided the energy needed to meet the Navy&#x27;s range goal of launching from safe areas in the Atlantic Ocean. They justified the risk thus:

All of this changed radically in the summer of 1956, when Project Nobska brought together leading scientists to consider antisubmarine warfare. As part of this workshop, Edward Teller stated that by 1963 a 1 megaton warhead would be reduced to only . Rocketry experts at the same meeting suggested that an intermediate-range weapon carrying one of these weapons could be built using solid propellant. Even in this case, the missile would be much smaller than Jupiter; Jupiter was expected to weigh , while estimates of a solid-fuel missile with similar range were closer to , along with a similar reduction in size which was of paramount importance to a submarine design.

The Navy announced their desire to develop their own missile that summer, initially under the name Jupiter-S. After intensive follow-up studies, the Navy withdrew from the Jupiter program in December 1956. This was officially announced by the Army in January 1957. In its place, the Navy began development of what was then known as the Fleet Ballistic Missile Program, and the missile was later renamed Polaris, their first submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). Rickover, one of the few remaining skeptics, was won over by pointing out that a properly designed submarine was needed specifically for this role, and he would be called upon to produce it. Rickover was from that point on a staunch ally of the program.

===Saved from cancellation===
On 4 October 1957, the Soviets successfully launched Sputnik I from their R-7 Semyorka ICBM. The US was aware of these efforts and had already talked to the press about it, suggesting that if the Soviets launched a satellite first it would be no big deal. To their surprise, the press exploded in rage over the affair. Having spent over a decade working on similar missiles, like Atlas, the fact that the Soviets could beat them was a serious blow, and prompted a deep review of the ongoing programs.

One problem noted from the start was that the internecine fighting between the Army and Air Force was leading to significant duplication of effort, with little to show for it. The Department of Defense responded by creating the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), whose initial mission was to look over all of the ongoing projects and select ones based solely on their technical merits.

At the same time, the fighting had begun to have negative political effects. In a 26 November 1956 memorandum, recently appointed US Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson attempted to end the fighting. His solution was to limit the Army to weapons with range, and those involved in surface-to-air defense to only . The memo also placed limits on Army air operations, severely limiting the weight of the aircraft it was allowed to operate. To some degree this simply formalized what had largely already been the case in practice, but Jupiter fell outside the range limits and the Army was forced to hand them to the Air Force.

The Air Force, of course, had no interest in taking over a weapon system they had long argued was not needed. However, ARPA&#x27;s studies clearly showed it was an excellent system, and as it was ready to enter production, any Air Force thoughts about canceling it were immediately quashed. New orders for 32 prototypes and 62 operational missiles were soon placed, bringing the total number of Jupiters to be built to 94. The first, hand-built at ABMA, would be delivered by the end of FY57, and the first production models from Chrysler&#x27;s Michigan Ordnance Missile Plant near Warren, Michigan between FY58 and FY61.

===Lingering complaints===
A primary complaint about Jupiter was that the design&#x27;s shorter range placed it within relatively easy striking distance of Soviet weapons, both missiles and aircraft. Thor, based in the UK, would likely have more warning of an impending attack. This is precisely the reason that the Army spent considerable effort on making Jupiter mobile, in order to make surprise attacks difficult without prior aerial reconnaissance missions.

However, in November 1958, the Air Force decided Jupiter would be launched from fixed emplacements. Army General Maxwell Taylor argued this was done deliberately, noting that:

To offset the possibility of air attack, the systems were upgraded to allow a launch within 15 minutes of a launch order.

==Testing history==
Rocketdyne tested the first S-3 engine at their Santa Susana, California facilities in November 1955. A mock-up was delivered to ABMA in January 1956, followed by the first prototype engines in July 1956. Testing of these engines began in September 1956 at ABMA&#x27;s new Power Plant Test Stand. This demonstrated a number of problems with unstable combustion, leading to the failure of four engines by November. To continue testing, the engine was temporarily derated back to 135,000 lbf and was successfully tested at this level in January 1957. Continued work on the engine developed several sub-versions, finally reaching the design goal of 150,000 lbf in the S-3D model.

The 135,000 pound engine, also used in the first Thor and Atlas tests, had conical thrust chambers, but the 150,000 pound model switched to bell-shaped thrust chambers. Unlike Thor and Atlas, which had two small vernier engines for roll control, Jupiter gimbaled the turbine exhaust. The early test model Jupiters had two small gas jets powered off the turbine exhaust, the gimbaled exhaust pipe not being introduced until late 1958.

===Static tests===
In 1954 Test Laboratory director Karl Heimburg began construction of the Static Test Stand for Redstone testing. This was still under construction when it was re-purposed for Jupiter, and finally completed in January 1957. A Jupiter was installed in the stand that month, and fired for the first time on 12 February 1957. This almost ended in disaster when a small explosion went off in the liquid oxygen (LOX) pump, and as the missile sat there the LOX boiled off and threatened to burst the tanks. The day was saved when the foreman, Paul Kennedy, ran to the missile and connected a pressure line to drain the oxygen buildup in the tank. The problem was later traced to the lubricant used in the pump, which tended to burst into flames in contact with LOX. A new lubricant was introduced, along with a series of changes to the test stand to help retain control in these situations.

===Flight tests===
Kurt Debus had led the construction of launch pads for Redstone missiles at Cape Canaveral, Florida, building the twin LC-5 and LC-6 pads about apart with a common blockhouse located away between the two. Redstone testing moved to these pads from the smaller LC-4 on 20 April 1955, with the launch of the seventh Redstone from LC-6. Envisioning an extended test program, a second set of similar pads began construction in 1956, LC-26 A and B; the only major difference was the blockhouse was located slightly further away, about . In late 1957 a set of parallel railway tracks running just east of the pads was added, allowing an A-frame gantry to be rolled to any of the four pads.

Jupiters were delivered to the Cape strapped to wheeled trailers and flown to the Cape&#x27;s &quot;Skid Strip&quot; on C-124s. They were then moved to Hangar R at the Cape Industrial Area where the nose cone was mated with the missile, and electrical checkout was performed. It was then moved on the trailer to the pads, about south, where they were lifted to vertical by a crane on the movable gantry. Just to the north of the launch area was the Air Force&#x27;s LC-17 for Thor, and LC-18 used for Thor and the Navy&#x27;s Vanguard. After the Army&#x27;s head start, the Air Force had since caught up and attempted its first Thor launch on 26 January 1957, which ended with the missile exploding on the launch pad.

Jupiter test flights commenced with the launch of AM-1A (ABMA Missile 1A) on 1 March 1957 from LC-5. This missile was equipped with the lower-thrust interim engine. The vehicle performed well until past 50 seconds into launch when control started to fail, leading to breakup at T+73 seconds. It was deduced that turbopump exhaust was sucked up by the partial vacuum in the area behind the missile and began to burn in the tail section. The heat burned through the control wiring, so extra insulation was added there on future flights. An identical AM-1B was quickly readied and launched on 26 April. AM-1B&#x27;s flight went entirely according to plan up to T+70 seconds when the missile started becoming unstable in flight and finally broke up at T+93 seconds. The failure was deduced to have been the result of propellant slosh due to bending modes induced by the steering maneuvers needed to perform the flight trajectory. The solution to this problem involved testing several types of baffles in a Jupiter center section until discovering a suitable type for both the LOX and fuel tanks.

The third Jupiter, also numbered AM-1, was quickly equipped with the baffles and launched on 31 May, slightly over a month after AM-1B, traveling a full downrange. This version had a slightly improved S-3 engine with thrust. AM-2 flew from LC-26A on 28 August, and successfully tested the separation of the rocket body from the reentry vehicle section before splashing down at . AM-3 flew from LC-26B on 23 October, including the ablative heat shield and the new ST-90 INS. This test flew a planned distance of .

AM-3A launched on 26 November and all went according to plan until T+101 seconds when engine thrust abruptly terminated. The missile broke up at T+232 seconds. On 18 December, AM-4 lost thrust T+117 seconds and fell into the ocean downrange. These failures were traced to an inadequate turbopump design that resulted in a string of failures in the Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas programs, all of which used a variant of the same Rocketdyne engine. Testing then paused for five months while Rocketdyne came up with a number of fixes and the Army retrofitted all its Jupiters with the redesigned pumps. In spite of these failures, Jupiter was declared operational on 15 January 1958.

Taking the time to also fully rate the engine to 150,000 lbf, the new engine was first flown on AM-5 on 18 May 1958 from LC-26B, reaching a planned . AM-5 also carried the real nose cone design, which separated from the rocket body, spun up the warhead, and separated to allow the warhead to continue on its own. The warhead section was equipped with a parachute and was recovered by the Navy some from its predicted splashdown point.

AM-6B included both the production nose cone and the ST-90 INS during its launch from LC-26B on 17 July 1958. This time the Navy recovered it only from its planned splashdown point downrange. AM-7 flew on 27 August, testing a new solid fuel rocket for spinup, replacing the older hydrogen peroxide model. AM-9 was launched on 10 October, the first Jupiter to carry the fully functional turbine exhaust roll control system. The flight failed however; a pinhole leak in the thrust transducer area started a thrust section fire and loss of vehicle control. The missile tumbled and broke up at T+49 seconds. 

Afterwards, there was only one more failure in the Jupiter program, AM-23 on 15 September 1959, which developed a leak in a nitrogen bottle that led to depressurization of the RP-1 tank and almost immediate loss of control at liftoff. The missile wobbled from side to side and the RP-1 tank began to break apart starting at T+7 seconds. The Jupiter flipped upside down, dumping out the contents of the RP-1 tank, followed by total vehicle breakup at T+13 seconds, just before the Range Safety Officer could issue the flight termination command. Flying debris struck and damaged a Juno II on the adjacent LC-5. This particular launch was carrying a biological nose cone with mice and other specimens (which did not survive).

Through the early 1960s, a number of Jupiters were launched by the forces of other countries, as well as the Air Force, as part of ongoing combat training. The last launch of this sort was by the Italian Air Force, CM-106, which took place from LC-26B on 23 January 1963.

===Biological flights===

Jupiter missiles were used in a series of suborbital biological test flights. On 13 December 1958, Jupiter AM-13 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida with a Navy-trained South American squirrel monkey named Gordo on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo did not survive the flight. Telemetry data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the of launch, eight minutes of weightlessness and of reentry at . The nose cone sank downrange from Cape Canaveral and was not recovered.

Another biological flight was launched on 28 May 1959. Aboard Jupiter AM-18 were a American-born rhesus monkey, Able, and an South American squirrel monkey, Baker. The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of and a distance of down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral. They withstood accelerations of and were weightless for about nine minutes. A top speed of was reached during their 16-minute flight.

After splashdown the Jupiter nosecone carrying Able and Baker was recovered by the seagoing tug USS &quot;Kiowa&quot; (ATF-72). The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker lived for many years after the flight, finally succumbing to kidney failure on 29 November 1984 at the United States Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

=== Mercury-Jupiter ===
Mercury-Jupiter was a proposed suborbital launch configuration consisting of a Jupiter missile carrying a Mercury capsule. Two flights were planned in support of Project Mercury. On July 1, 1959, less than a year after the October, 1958 program start date, the flights were canceled due to budget constraints. The MJ-1 flight would have been a heat shield test. The MJ-2 flight was planned as a maximum dynamic pressure qualification test of the production Mercury spacecraft with a chimpanzee on board.

==Operational deployment==
In April 1958, under the command of President Eisenhower, the U.S. Department of Defense notified the Air Force it had tentatively planned to deploy the first three Jupiter squadrons (45 missiles) in France. However, in June 1958 the new French President Charles de Gaulle refused to accept basing any Jupiter missiles in France. This prompted U.S. to explore the possibility of deploying the missiles in Italy and Turkey. The Air Force was already implementing plans to base four squadrons (60 missiles) under Project Emily —subsequently redefined as 20 Royal Air Force squadrons each with three missiles—of PGM-17 Thor IRBMs in Britain on airfields stretching from Yorkshire to East Anglia.

In 1958, the United States Air Force activated the 864th Strategic Missile Squadron at ABMA. Although the USAF briefly considered training its Jupiter crews at Vandenberg AFB, California, it later decided to conduct all of its training at Huntsville. In June and September of the same year the Air Force activated two more squadrons, the 865th and 866th.

In April 1959, the secretary of the Air Force issued implementing instructions to USAF to deploy two Jupiter squadrons to Italy. The two squadrons, totaling 30 missiles, were deployed at 10 sites in Italy from 1961 to 1963. They were operated by Italian Air Force crews, but USAF personnel controlled arming the nuclear warheads. The deployed missiles were under command of 36th Strategic Interdiction Air Brigade (&quot;36ª Aerobrigata Interdizione Strategica&quot;, Italian Air Force) at Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy.

In October 1959, the location of the third and final Jupiter MRBM squadron was settled when a government-to-government agreement was signed with Turkey. The U.S. and Turkey concluded an agreement to deploy one Jupiter squadron on NATO&#x27;s southern flank. One squadron totaling 15 missiles was deployed at five sites near İzmir, Turkey from 1961 to 1963, operated by USAF personnel, with the first flight of three Jupiter missiles turned over to the Türk Hava Kuvvetleri (Turkish Air Force) in late October 1962, but USAF personnel retaining control of nuclear warhead arming.

On four occasions between mid-October 1961 and August 1962, Jupiter mobile missiles carrying 1.4 megatons of TNT (5.9 PJ) nuclear warheads were struck by lightning at their bases in Italy. In each case, thermal batteries were activated, and on two occasions, tritium-deuterium &quot;boost&quot; gas was injected into the warhead pits, partially arming them. After the fourth lightning strike on a Jupiter MRBM, the USAF placed protective lightning strike-diversion tower arrays at all of the Italian and Turkish Jupiter MRBM missiles sites.

In 1962, a Bulgarian MiG-17 reconnaissance airplane was reported to have crashed into an olive grove near one of the U.S. Jupiter missile launch sites in Italy, after overflying the site.

By the time the Turkish Jupiters had been installed, the missiles were already largely obsolete and increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attacks. All Jupiter MRBMs were removed from service by April 1963, as a backdoor trade with the Soviets in exchange for their earlier removal of MRBMs from Cuba.

==Description==

Jupiter squadrons consisted of 15 missiles and approximately 500 military personnel with five &quot;flights&quot; of three missiles each, manned by five officers and 10 NCOs. To reduce vulnerability, the flights were located approximately 30 miles apart, with the triple launcher emplacements separated by a distance of several hundred miles.

The ground equipment for each emplacement was housed in approximately 20 vehicles; including two generator trucks, a power distribution truck, short- and long-range theodolites, a hydraulic and pneumatic truck and a liquid oxygen truck. Another trailer carried 6000 gallons of fuel and three liquid oxygen trailers each carried .

The missiles arrived at the emplacement on large trailers; while still on the trailer, the crew attached the hinged launch pedestal to the base of the missile which was hauled to an upright position using a winch. Once the missile was vertical, fuel and oxidizer lines were connected and the bottom third of the missile was encased in a &quot;flower petal shelter&quot;, consisting of wedge-shaped metal panels, allowing crew members to service the missiles in all weather conditions. Stored empty, on 15-minute combat status in an upright position on the launch pad, the firing sequence included filling the fuel and oxidizer tanks with of LOX and of RP-1, while the guidance system was aligned and targeting information loaded. Once the fuel and oxidizer tanks were full, the launch controlling officer and two crewmen in a mobile launch control trailer could launch the missiles.

Each squadron was supported by a receipt, inspection and maintenance (RIM) area to the rear of the emplacements. RIM teams inspected new missiles and provided maintenance and repair to missiles in the field. Each RIM area also housed 25 tons of liquid oxygen and nitrogen generating plants. Several times a week, tanker trucks carried the fuel from the plant to the individual emplacements.

==Launch vehicle derivatives==
The Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets first stage was manufactured using the tooling from Jupiter and Redstone production, consisting of a central tank of the same diameter of the Jupiter missile with eight tanks of the same diameter as the Redstone clustered around it, all containing LOX/RP-1.

The Jupiter MRBM was also modified by adding upper stages, in the form of clustered Sergeant-derived rockets, to create a space launch vehicle called Juno II, not to be confused with the Juno I which was a Redstone-Jupiter-C missile development. There is also some confusion with another U.S. Army rocket called the Jupiter-C, which were Redstone missiles modified by lengthening the fuel tanks and adding small solid-fueled upper stages.

===Specifications (Juno II launch vehicle)===

The Juno II was a four-stage rocket derived from the Jupiter IRBM. It was used for 10 satellite launches, six of which failed. It launched Pioneer 3 (a partial success), Pioneer 4, Explorer 7, Explorer 8, and Explorer 11.

<text>Isaac Toucey (November 15, 1792July 30, 1869) was an American politician who served as a U.S. senator, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Attorney General and the 33rd Governor of Connecticut.

==Biography==
Born in Newtown, Connecticut, Toucey pursued classical studies; studied law and was admitted to the bar at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1818. From 1825 to 1835 he had his own practice in Hartford, Connecticut. He married Catherine Nichols in Hartford on October 28, 1827. The couple had no children.

==Career==
In 1822, Toucey was named prosecuting attorney of Hartford County, Connecticut. He served in that position until 1835, when he was elected to the 24th and 25th Congresses (at-large and then representing the 1st District). He served from 1835 to 1839. He lost the election of 1838 and returned to his position as prosecuting attorney in 1842.

In 1845, Toucey ran for Governor of Connecticut and lost, but the Connecticut State Legislature appointed him to the position following the election in 1846. During his tenure, an antibribery bill geared toward eliminating fraudulent electoral procedures was considered. He was defeated in an attempt at re-nomination in 1847.

In 1848, President James K. Polk appointed Toucey the 20th Attorney General of the United States, a position he held until 1849. He returned to Connecticut and took a place in the Connecticut Senate in 1850, and then in the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1852.

Toucey was elected to the U.S. Senate for the term commencing March 4, 1851, and served from May 12, 1852, to March 3, 1857, having that year declined to be a candidate for reelection. During that time, he often served as the legislative point man for Franklin Pierce and his administration.

James Buchanan, with whom Toucey had served in the Polk administration, appointed him U.S. Secretary of the Navy in his Cabinet in 1857 as a sop to the Pierce faction as well as to represent New England in the Cabinet. A moderate Northerner much in line with Buchanan&#x27;s thought in the sectional controversies of the day, Toucey held that post until 1861 and the arrival of the Abraham Lincoln administration. During that time, Toucey would undergo criticism for alleged corruption as uncovered by the Covode Committee, resulting in him being censured by the House of Representatives in June 1860. Toucey was then replaced by one of his chief rivals in Connecticut, Gideon Welles. After 1861 he returned to his law practice.

==Death and legacy==
Toucey died in Hartford on July 30, 1869. He is interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut. USS &quot;Toucey&quot; (DD-282) was named for him.

<doc id="710483" wikidata="Q7437566" url="?curid=710483" title="Scott domain">
<text>In the mathematical fields of order and domain theory, a Scott domain is an algebraic, bounded-complete and directed-complete partial order (dcpo). They are named in honour of Dana S. Scott, who was the first to study these structures at the advent of domain theory. Scott domains are very closely related to algebraic lattices, being different only in possibly lacking a greatest element. They are also closely related to Scott information systems, which constitute a &quot;syntactic&quot; representation of Scott domains.

While the term &quot;Scott domain&quot; is widely used with the above definition, the term &quot;domain&quot; does not have such a generally accepted meaning and different authors will use different definitions; Scott himself used &quot;domain&quot; for the structures now called &quot;Scott domains&quot;. Additionally, Scott domains appear with other names like &quot;algebraic semilattice&quot; in some publications.

Originally, Dana Scott demanded a complete lattice, and the Russian mathematician Yuri Yershov constructed the isomorphic structure of dcpo. But this was not recognized until after scientific communications improved after the fall of the Iron Curtain. In honour of their work, a number of mathematical papers now dub this fundamental construction a &quot;Scott–Ershov&quot; domain.

== Definition ==

Formally, a non-empty partially ordered set formula_1 is called a &quot;Scott domain&quot; if the following hold:

* is directed-complete, i.e. all directed subsets of have a supremum.
* is bounded-complete, i.e. all subsets of that have some upper bound have a supremum.
* is algebraic, i.e. every element of can be obtained as the supremum of a directed set of compact elements of .

== Properties ==

Since the empty set certainly has some upper bound, we can conclude the existence of a least element formula_2 (the supremum of the empty set) from bounded completeness.

The property of being bounded-complete is equivalent to the existence of infima of all &quot;non-empty&quot; subsets of . It is well known that the existence of &quot;all&quot; infima implies the existence of all suprema and thus makes a partially ordered set into a complete lattice. Thus, when a top element (the infimum of the empty set) is adjoined to a Scott domain, one can conclude that:

# the new top element is compact (since the order was directed complete before) and
# the resulting poset will be an algebraic lattice (i.e. a complete lattice that is algebraic).

Consequently, Scott domains are in a sense &quot;almost&quot; algebraic lattices. However, removing the top element from a complete lattice does not always produce a Scott domain. (Consider the complete lattice formula_3. The finite subsets of formula_4 form a directed set, but have no upper bound in formula_5.)

Scott domains become topological spaces by introducing the Scott topology.

== Explanation ==

Scott domains are intended to represent &quot;partial algebraic data&quot;, ordered by information content. An element formula_6 is a piece of data that might not be fully defined. The statement formula_7 means &quot;formula_8 contains all the information that formula_9 does&quot;. The bottom element is the element containing no information at all. Compact elements are the elements representing a finite amount of information.

With this interpretation we can see that the supremum formula_10 of a subset formula_11 is the element that contains all the information that &quot;any&quot; element of formula_12 contains, but &quot;no more&quot;. Obviously such a supremum only exists (i.e., makes sense) provided formula_12 does not contain inconsistent information; hence the domain is directed and bounded complete, but not &quot;all&quot; suprema necessarily exist. The algebraicity axiom essentially ensures that all elements get all their information from (non-strictly) lower down in the ordering; in particular, the jump from compact or &quot;finite&quot; to non-compact or &quot;infinite&quot; elements does not covertly introduce any extra information that cannot be reached at some finite stage. 

On the other hand, the infimum formula_14 is the element that contains all the information that is shared by &quot;all&quot; elements of formula_12, and &quot;no less&quot;. If formula_12 contains no consistent information, then its elements have no information in common and so its infimum is formula_2. In this way all non-empty infima exist, but not all infima are necessarily interesting.

This definition in terms of partial data allows an algebra to be defined as the limit of a sequence of increasingly more defined partial algebras—in other words a fixed point of an operator that adds progressively more information to the algebra. For more information, see Domain theory.

== Examples ==

* Every finite poset is directed-complete and algebraic (though not necessarily bounded-complete). Thus any bounded-complete finite poset is a Scott domain.
* The natural numbers with an additional top element ω constitute an algebraic lattice, hence a Scott domain. For more examples in this direction, see the article on algebraic lattices.
* Consider the set of all finite and infinite words over the alphabet }, ordered by the prefix order on words. Thus, a word is smaller than some word if is a prefix of , i.e. if there is some (finite or infinite) word such that formula_18. For example, formula_19. The empty word is the bottom element of this ordering, and every directed set (which is always a chain) is easily seen to have a supremum. Likewise, one immediately verifies bounded completeness. However, the resulting poset is certainly missing a top having many maximal elements instead (namely all the infinite words). It is also algebraic, since every finite word happens to be compact and we certainly can approximate infinite words by chains of finite ones. Thus this is a Scott domain which is not an algebraic lattice.
* For a negative example, consider the real numbers in the unit interval , ordered by their natural order. This bounded-complete dcpo is not algebraic. In fact its only compact element is 0.

<text>Potosí (; Quechua: &quot;P&#x27;utuqsi&quot;; Aymara: &quot;Putusi&quot;) is a department in southwestern Bolivia. Its area is 118,218 km2 and its population is 856,419 (2024 census). The capital is the city of Potosí. 
It is a mostly barren, mountainous region with one large plateau to the west, where the largest salt flat in the world, Salar de Uyuni, is located.

Cerro Potosí was the richest province in the Spanish Empire, providing a great percentage of the silver that was shipped to Europe.

Potosi is also the location of the San Cristóbal silver, zinc and lead mines, developed by the US company Apex Silver Mines Limited of Colorado and sold in November 2008 to the Japanese Sumitomo Corporation.

==History==

In March 2023, social organisations in four regions of Potosí, with the support of regional MAS-IPSP lawmakers, called for a strike spanning over 72 hours, to force the government to raise infrastructure investments in the department and to receive an increased amount of the profits generated through lithium mining in the region. Shortly after the strike an agreement with the central government was reached, stipulating the construction of motorways and a cement plant and further discussions about mining conditions.

==Government==
===Executive offices===
The chief executive office of Bolivia departments (since May 2010) is the governor; until then, the office was called the prefect, and until 2006 the prefect was appointed by the President of Bolivia. The current governor, Jhonny Mamani of the Movement for Socialism – Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples was elected on 7 March 2021.

===Legislative Assembly===
Under the 2009 Constitution, each Bolivian department has an elected Departmental Legislative Assembly. The first elections were held 4 April 2010.

The current executive committee consists of Jacinto Sunagua Dorado as president, Raimunda Cordero Caba as vice-president and Alberto Quispe Mamani as secretary and Blanca Celia Burgos Quispe and Leon Jancko Condori as first and second committee member, respectively.

<doc id="710494" wikidata="Q5497579" url="?curid=710494" title="Frederick Corfield">
<text>Sir Frederick Vernon Corfield (1 June 1915 – 25 August 2005) was a British Conservative politician and minister.

==Early life==
Corfield was the son of Brigadier Frederick Alleyne Corfield of the British Indian Army and Mary Graham Vernon. His father also owned the Chatwall estate at Cardington, Shropshire, which Frederick inherited on his father&#x27;s death in 1939.

He was educated firstly at Brockhurst Preparatory School at Church Stretton and then at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1935. He was then posted to India until 1939, only to be sent to France with the British Expeditionary Force after the outbreak of World War II. By 1940 he was serving in the 51st (Highland) Division, and mentioned in dispatches, but, as the Germans advanced, the division was cut off and forced to surrender. Thus Corfield spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of war, latterly at Oflag IX A/Z at Rotenburg an der Fulda. During his time as a prisoner he studied law, and passed examinations qualifying as a barrister.

After his return to England he was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1946 and spent a year in the army&#x27;s Judge Advocate General&#x27;s branch within England. This did not suit him. He spent the next decade mainly as a farmer; first on the family farm at Chatwall in Shropshire, whose main estate he sold in 1951 (keeping some land whose rents he donated to Cardington church, whose advowson he also retained) then on a farm at Middle Lypiatt near Stroud in Gloucestershire.

==Political career==
In 1955 he became MP for South Gloucestershire.
Shortly after becoming an MP he launched a private member&#x27;s bill to improve compensation for compulsory land purchases. He received a second reading for his bill in February 1958, against government advice, and its general principles were incorporated in the Town and Country Planning Act of 1959.

He became secretary of the Conservative MPs&#x27; agriculture committee (1956–62), and chairman of its small farms subcommittee (1957–58). He also became parliamentary private secretary to Airey Neave. Under Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home he held the position of Joint Parliamentary Secretary of Housing and Local Government (1962–4). He became an opposition spokesman on land and natural resources 1964–65 and subsequently an executive member of the 1922 Committee. 

In 1970 Corfield was briefly Minister of State at the newly formed Department of Trade and Industry under John Davies. He subsequently held the positions of Minister for Aviation Supply and Aerospace Minister (1970–2) where he was responsible for the cancellation of the Black Arrow rocketry programme but provided financial assistance to Rolls-Royce (whose Filton, Bristol factory was within his constituency) when it ran into difficulties that hampered its defence commitments. This help included the nationalisation of the strategically significant aero-engine part of RR. He also presided over the first full scale roll-out of Concorde.

He returned to the backbenches in 1972 and did not contest his Gloucestershire seat in the general election of February 1974, having decided to stand down because of his disagreement with the government&#x27;s then economic policies and the leadership of Edward Heath and a conviction - proved correct - that his party would lose the election.

==Later career==
After this retirement from the Commons, Corfield, who had become a member of the Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1972, returned to legal pursuits, becoming a Bencher of the Middle Temple and sat as Recorder of a County Court from 1979 to 1987. He joined the committee of the British Waterways Board in 1974 and was its Vice-Chairman from 1980 to 1983. He took seats on the boards of various water companies, although in 1987 he opposed the universal privatisation of the nationalised water utilities that was introduced by the government of Margaret Thatcher.

==Publications==
Corfield was author of the following legal works:

*&quot;Corfield on Compensation&quot; (1959)
*&quot;A Guide to the Community Land Act, 1976&quot; (1976)
*&quot;Compulsory Acquisitional Compensation&quot; (with R.J.A. Chinworth) (1978)

==Personal life==
On 10 August 1945 he married Elizabeth Mary Ruth Taylor, at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton in London. His mother wanted the wedding performed by her own cousin, the Dean of Canterbury, then Hewlett Johnson, but because of the couple&#x27;s opposition to Johnson&#x27;s pro-Communist politics, it was instead carried out by one of his father&#x27;s relations, former Bishop Bernard Corfield.

He died in August 2005.

<text>William French Smith II (August 26, 1917 – October 29, 1990) was an American lawyer and the 74th United States Attorney General. After attaining his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1942, Smith went on to join the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP in 1946. Smith became acquainted with California governor candidate Ronald Reagan in 1966, after which Reagan appointed him to the University of California Board of Regents. Smith was nominated for U.S. Attorney General shortly after Reagan&#x27;s victory in the 1980 United States presidential election, assuming the title on January 23, 1981, and serving until February 25, 1985.

Smith contributed to Reagan&#x27;s administration by supporting his stances on welfare, crime, bail, prison sentencing for gun-related crimes, the Internal Revenue Service, immigration, corporate mergers, anti-competitive practices, the Freedom of Information Act, and illegal drug trade. 

After his tenure as Attorney General, Smith went back to work for Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. He died from cancer on October 29, 1990.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Wilton, New Hampshire, on August 26, 1917, and raised in Boston. He received his B.A. degree in economics, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1939, and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1942. Smith was a direct descendant of Urian Oakes, a 17th-century Harvard College president. His father of the same name was president of Boston-based Mexican Telephone and Telegraph Co. From 1942 to 1946, Smith served in the United States Naval Reserve, reaching the rank of lieutenant.

In 1946 he joined the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP in Los Angeles. He met Ronald Reagan before his 1966 campaign for governor, and eventually became a close friend and a member of Reagan&#x27;s &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; of advisers. In 1968, Reagan appointed him to the University of California Board of Regents. He later served three terms as chairman.

==Career==
===Attorney General of the United States===
On December 11, 1980, Smith was nominated as the 74th Attorney General by then-President-elect Ronald Reagan. He assumed his post at the United States Department of Justice, on January 23, 1981, serving until February 25, 1985. He pursued a strong anti-crime initiative, increasing the resources used to fight the distribution and sale of illegal narcotics by 100 percent. Furthermore, he successfully lobbied for the establishment of a commission to create new federal sentencing guidelines. Major contributions were: supporting Reagan&#x27;s welfare reform program, recommending a comprehensive crime package, of more than 150 administrative and legislative initiatives (which included a federal death penalty), the denial of bail for certain types of crimes, the modification of the rule barring the use of illegally seized evidence in criminal trials, mandatory prison sentences for crimes involving the use of guns, and the use of private Internal Revenue Service information in combating organized crime. He also designed an immigration and refugee policy, announced a more lenient attitude towards corporate mergers in order to make government more responsive to the concerns of business, opposed anti competitive practices, and modified the Freedom of Information Act of 1966, among many other initiatives. Smith concentrated on getting more money for his department, which expanded federal efforts against drug trafficking.

President Ronald Reagan said this about Smith during a speech announcing the Federal Initiatives Against Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime;

Smith was a member of the American Law Institute, American Judicature Society, and the Institute of Judicial Administration&#x27;s Board of Fellows, as well as a fellow of the American Bar Foundation. He served as Attorney General from 1981 to 1985 and then joined the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

Smith also played a role in the nomination of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Prior to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s appointment to the Court, she was an elected official and judge in Arizona serving as the first female majority leader in the United States as the Republican leader in the Arizona Senate. President Ronald Reagan formally nominated O&#x27;Connor on August 19, 1981. On September 21, 1981, O&#x27;Connor was confirmed by the U.S. Senate with a decision of 99–0. Judicial analyst Steven Brill gave Smith credit for gaining control of the Justice Department &quot;mega-bureaucracy&quot; and for cleaning up the corruption-plagued Drug Enforcement Administration. Smith established a judicial-selection system that appears to have produced conservative but qualified federal judges.

He served as the member of the U.S. Advisory Commission on International, Educational and Cultural Affairs in Washington, D.C. from 1971 to 1978; a member of the board of directors of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council since 1970 and its president beginning in 1975; a member of the Los Angeles Committee on Foreign Relations from 1954 to 1974; and a member of the Harvard University&#x27;s School of Government.

He also served as a member of the advisory board of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University and was a member of the Stanton Panel on International Information, Education and Cultural Relations in Washington from 1974–1975.

His business affiliations included service as a director of the Pacific Lighting Corp. of Los Angeles from 1967 to 1981 and the Pacific Lighting Corp. of San Francisco from 1969 to 1981, a seat on the board of directors of Jorgensen Steel Company from 1974 to 1981, and a seat on the board of directors of Pullman Company of Chicago from 1979 to 1980.

He was the member of a California delegation to the Republican National Convention in 1968, 1972, and 1976, he was serving as the chairman of the delegation in 1968 and the vice chairman of the delegation in 1972 and 1976.

During his tenure as Attorney General in President Reagan&#x27;s cabinet from 1981–1985, Smith facilitated a deal where the U.S. and Italy agreed on a strategy to combat organized crime and narcotics trafficking.

===After office===
After leaving office, Smith rejoined the powerful law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in Los Angeles. He also served on the boards of major corporations and was named chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation, where he was instrumental in locating site for the attraction. He is remembered as a quiet, yet effective statesman. In the words of &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Smith seldom spoke, but when he did, he was always worth hearing. No one had an ill word to say about him, so great was his decency − the quality he had most in common, perhaps, with the man he served so long.&quot;

===Tower Commission===
The Tower Commission was commissioned on November 26, 1986, by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in response to the Iran–Contra affair. Reagan appointed Republican and former Senator John Tower of Texas, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft.

==Death==
Smith died of cancer in Los Angeles on October 29, 1990, age 73, at the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Center.

Reagan said of Smith, &quot;Our nation was indeed fortunate to have a person of his excellence and patriotism in the cabinet. And we were made better as a country because of Bill&#x27;s work. More than a colleague, Bill was a valued and trusted friend and adviser. I often sought his wise counsel throughout my years in public life, and I was fortunate to have him at my side.&quot;

He was interred November 1 at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. A one-hour memorial funeral service, attended by 250 people, was held on November 2 at the Community Church of San Marino, where he was eulogized by Reagan and others. &quot;Bill ... believed firmly in limited government and keeping government as close to the people as possible&quot;, said United States Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr in his eulogy.

Smith had three sons and one daughter with his first wife, Marion. His second wife, Jean Webb Vaughan Smith, who championed volunteerism as national president of the Association of Junior Leagues, died in 2012, aged 93.

==Legacy==
In 1992, independent presidential candidate Ross Perot considered naming Smith, &quot;who&#x27;d been dead for a couple of years,&quot; as his vice presidential running mate, according to Perot&#x27;s campaign manager Ed Rollins.

<doc id="710502" wikidata="Q1750919" url="?curid=710502" title="NFL draft">
<text>The NFL draft, officially known as the Annual Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event which serves as the most common source of player recruitment in the National Football League. Each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first and the Super Bowl champion is last. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade its position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its position in the draft. The first draft was held in 1936 and has been held every year since.

Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have been revised since its creation, but the fundamental method has remained the same. Currently, the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, be able to choose the best player available. In the early years of the draft, players were chosen based on hearsay, print media, or other rudimentary evidence of ability. In the 1940s, some franchises began employing full-time scouts. The ensuing success of these teams eventually forced the other franchises to also hire scouts.

Colloquially, the name of the draft each year takes on the form of the NFL season in which players picked could begin playing. For example, the 2010 NFL draft was for the 2010 NFL season. However, the NFL-defined name of the process has changed since its inception. The location of the draft has continually changed over the years to accommodate more fans, as the event has gained popularity. The draft&#x27;s popularity now garners prime-time television coverage. In the league&#x27;s early years, from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, the draft was held in various cities with NFL franchises until the league settled on New York City starting in 1965, where it remained for fifty years until 2015, when future draft locations started being determined through a yearly bidding process.

==History==

===Precursor and rationale===

In the early 1930s, Stan Kostka had an excellent college career as a University of Minnesota running back, leading the Minnesota Gophers to an undefeated season in 1934. Every NFL team wanted to sign him. Kostka took advantage of the lack of a draft and held out for the highest possible offer. While a free agent, he even ran for Mayor of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Although his political career did not take off, Kostka&#x27;s nine-month NFL holdout succeeded and he became the league&#x27;s highest-paid player, signing a $5,000 contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 25, 1935. As a response to the bidding war for Stan Kostka, the NFL instituted the draft in 1936.

In late 1934, Art Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, gave the right of usage of two players to the New York Giants because Rooney&#x27;s team had no chance to participate in the postseason. After the owner of the Boston Redskins, George Preston Marshall, protested the transaction, the president of the NFL, Joe F. Carr, disallowed the Giants the ability to employ the players. At a league meeting in December 1934, the NFL introduced a waiver rule to prevent such transactions. Any player released by a team during the season would be able to be claimed by other teams. The selection order to claim the player would be in inverse order to the teams&#x27; standings at the time.

Throughout this time, Bert Bell, co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team&#x27;s lack of competitiveness on the field made it difficult for the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable. Compounding the Eagles&#x27; problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money, or if the money being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time, who had established a winning tradition. As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins. Bell&#x27;s inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935, eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have an equal opportunity to sign eligible players. At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of competitive parity on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day, although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.

The rules for the selection of the players in the first draft were, first, that a list of college seniors would be assembled by each franchise and submitted into a pool. From this pool, each franchise would select, in inverse order to their team&#x27;s record in the previous year, a player. With this selection, the franchise had the unilateral right to negotiate a contract with that player, or the ability to trade that player to another team for a player, or players. If, for any reason, the franchise was unsuccessful in negotiating a contract with the player and was unable to trade the player, the president of the NFL could attempt to arbitrate a settlement between the player and the franchise. If the president was unable to settle the dispute, then the player would be placed in the &quot;reserve list&quot; of the franchise and would be unavailable to play for any team in the NFL that year. In the 1935 NFL season, the Eagles finished in last place at 2–9, thus securing themselves the first pick in the draft.

===The first draft (1936)===
The first NFL draft began at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia on February 8, 1936. Ninety names were written on a blackboard in the meeting room from which the teams would choose. As no team had a scouting department, the list was created from either print media sources, visits to local colleges by team executives, or by recommendations to team executives. The draft would last for nine rounds, and it had no media coverage. The first player ever selected in the draft was Jay Berwanger. Bell, prior to the draft, was not successfully able to negotiate a contract with Berwanger so Bell traded him to the Bears. George Halas, owner of the Bears, was also unsuccessful in signing Berwanger. Berwanger&#x27;s decision to not play in the NFL was not unusual, as only twenty-four of the eighty-one players selected chose to play in the NFL that year. The draft was recessed on the first day and it was continued and finished on the next day.

This draft saw the emergence of Wellington Mara as a savant, as he had been subscribing to magazines and local and out-of-town papers to build up dossiers of college players across the country, which resulted in the Giants&#x27; drafting of Tuffy Leemans. As a result of the institution of the draft, Tim Mara, owner of the Giants, reduced Ken Strong&#x27;s salary offer to $3,200 from $6,000 a year for 1936 because Mara felt the draft would alter the salary structure of the NFL. Generally, the franchises&#x27; exclusivity in negotiating with draft picks produced the immediate effect of, depending on sources, stopping the escalating salaries of new players, or reducing their salaries. Consequently, contemporary critics charged it was anti-labor.

===Early drafts (1937–1946)===
Art Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chose Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White in the first round of the 1938 draft despite White&#x27;s known public declaration that he would not play professional football and would instead begin work on his Rhodes scholarship. White did, however, agree to play for the 1938 season after Rooney publicly gave him a guaranteed contract of $15,000, double what any other player had ever made in the NFL. The size of the dollar amount brought condemnation from other owners because it altered the pay expectations of college draftees. For the 1939 draft Wellington, for the first time, was put in charge of drafting players for the Giants. He submitted the list of players into the pool that the Giants—or other franchises—could choose players from. However, in the first round he selected a player, Walt Nielsen, not on the list of players that the Giants or any other franchise had submitted. With a grin Wellington stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think I said I put every name on that list.&quot;

In 1939, Kenny Washington was, to no small extent, viewed as one of the greatest college football players of all time. After information was made available to at least one owner of a franchise that Washington was African-American, he was not drafted by any team for the 1940 NFL draft.

The draft would be eventually codified into the &quot;NFL Constitution&quot;, although no information is available on when that originally occurred.

&quot;Bullet Bill&quot; Dudley was the first overall pick in the 1942 draft and he would eventually become the first player picked first overall in the draft to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Scouting era begins (1946–1959)===
Eddie Kotal became the first player scout in 1946 when he was hired by Dan Reeves of the Los Angeles Rams.

The NFL&#x27;s competition with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1947 resulted in a temporary institution of a &quot;bonus pick&quot;. Under this system, the first overall selection was awarded as a bonus pick by a random draw, while the last place team picked second, and so on. The team that won this draft lottery then forfeited its selection in the final round of the draft. The winner was then also eliminated from the draw in future years. By 1958, all twelve clubs in the league at the time had received a bonus choice and this system was abolished.

Competitive parity did not, however, quickly arrive in the NFL as perennial losers, such as the Eagles and Chicago Cardinals, standings&#x27; did not improve until 1947.

In the 1949 NFL draft, George Taliaferro became the first African-American selected when he was chosen in the thirteenth round. He however, chose to sign with an AAFC team. Wally Triplett was chosen in the nineteenth and he would be the first African-American to be selected in the draft and make an NFL team. After the draft and prior to the start of the season, Paul &quot;Tank&quot; Younger was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent and became the first NFL player from an historically black college. Eddie Robinson, Younger&#x27;s coach at Grambling, promptly and unequivocally, impressed upon him that the future of the recruitment and drafting of his colleagues at other black colleges lay in the balance based on his success with the Rams.

===Technology (1960–1979)===
The 1960 NFL draft marked a turning point in the draft&#x27;s history because of the pending arrival of the American Football League (AFL), as it became a &quot;high-stakes, competitive affair.&quot;

In 1976, former NFL wide receiver Paul Salata first coined the moniker &quot;Mr. Irrelevant&quot; to refer to the last overall player selected in the draft.

===ESPN and the digital age (1980–2017)===
In 1980, Chet Simmons, president of the year-old ESPN, asked Pete Rozelle if the fledgling network could broadcast coverage of the draft live on ESPN. Although Rozelle did not believe it would be entertaining television, he agreed. In 1988, the NFL moved the draft from weekdays to the weekend and ESPN&#x27;s ratings of the coverage improved dramatically.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT 1991/04/22&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ESPN received competition when the NFL Network, which had launched in October 2003, began to produce its own draft coverage. ESPN pays the NFL a rights fee for the non-exclusive rights to draft coverage, a fee that is included in its overall contract to televise games (&quot;ESPN Sunday Night NFL&quot; from 1987 to 2005, and &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from 2006 to the present).

In 2010, the NFL moved to a three-day draft with the first day encompassing the first round beginning at 8:00 pm EDT Thursday, the second day encompassing the second and third rounds beginning at 7:00 pm EDT Friday, and third day concluding the process with the final four rounds beginning at 11:00 am EDT Saturday.

===Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, and ABC (2018)===

2018 was the first time ever that the draft was carried on broadcast television. As a prelude to their new &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; contract, Fox and NFL Network simulcast the first two nights of the draft, with both nights featuring personnel from both NFL Network and Fox. ESPN continued to produce its own coverage of the draft, with ESPN2 simulcasting days 1 and 2, and ABC simulcasting day 3. NFL Network&#x27;s main set featured the crew of host Rich Eisen, Daniel Jeremiah, draft expert Mike Mayock, and Stanford head coach David Shaw, with Steve Mariucci, Steve Smith Sr., and Fox NFL lead analyst Troy Aikman joining from an outside set for day 1. Other analysts included: Fox College Football lead analyst Joel Klatt, Charles Davis, and Deion Sanders.

===NFL Network, ABC, and ESPN (2019–present)===

The Fox/NFL Network simulcast would only last one year, as ABC picked up the broadcast television rights for all 3 days of the draft in 2019. ABC&#x27;s coverage would have the &quot;College GameDay&quot; crew on days 1 and 2, with &quot;Good Morning America&quot; anchor Robin Roberts, joined by 2018 NFL MVP and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and Grammy Award winner Taylor Swift, co-hosting with &quot;GameDay&quot; host Rece Davis on day 1. Also, on day 1, Swift announced her new single &quot;ME!&quot;, featuring Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s Brendon Urie, being released at midnight ET, with the music video debuting on YouTube at the same time. Day 3 featured the ESPN crew of Trey Wingo, NFL insiders Louis Riddick, and draft experts Todd McShay and Mel Kiper Jr., hosting ABC&#x27;s coverage, which was a simulcast of ESPN&#x27;s coverage.

For the 2020 NFL draft, which was supposed to be in Las Vegas but was moved to a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NFL Network decided to simulcast ESPN&#x27;s coverage of all 3 days. Personalities from NFL Network like: draft guru Daniel Jeremiah, Hall of Fame QB Kurt Warner, and Hall of Fame WR Michael Irvin joined ESPN personnel on all 3 days. ABC continued to carry a feed with the &quot;College GameDay&quot; crew for the first two days of the draft. Majority of the analysts joined remotely from their homes with Trey Wingo, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, and Maria Taylor working from ESPN&#x27;s Bristol, CT studios. Todd McShay was to also participate in the draft, but was unable to due to him testing positive for COVID.

2021 saw a return to normal as after a one-year hiatus, NFL Network returned to producing their own coverage of the draft. ESPN and ABC continued to carry separate feeds, one with all the &quot;X&#x27;s and O&#x27;s&quot; on ESPN, and the other with the &quot;College GameDay&quot; crew on ABC. After Wingo left ESPN in 2020, Mike Greenberg, host of &quot;Get Up!&quot;, took over as ESPN&#x27;s host for the first two nights, while Davis, who continued as ABC&#x27;s host, hosted ESPN&#x27;s coverage of Day 3, which was also simulcast on ABC.

2022 saw the draft head to Las Vegas after a two-year wait. NFL Network saw no personnel changes, but ESPN and ABC took a few hits. ESPN announced that insider Adam Schefter would miss the draft to attend his son&#x27;s college graduation, and Mel Kiper Jr. would participate virtually because of his COVID-19 vaccination status. Kirk Herbstreit meanwhile, announced himself that he would be dropping out of ABC&#x27;s draft coverage due to blood clots.

==Current format==
Players who have been out of high school for at least three years are eligible for the NFL draft. The rules do not state that a player must attend college, but virtually all of the players selected in the NFL draft have played college football, usually in the United States but occasionally from Canadian universities as well. A few players are occasionally selected from other football leagues like the Arena Football League (AFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the German Football League (GFL). A small handful of players have also been drafted from colleges who played sports other than football.

Rules state only that a player must be three years removed from high school graduation, regardless of what the prospective draftee did during that time. A year as a redshirt player in college counts toward eligibility even though the player was not allowed to participate in games during that year, therefore players who have completed their redshirt sophomore year can enter the NFL draft.

===Rules for determining draft order===
The selection order is based on each team&#x27;s win–loss record in the previous season and whether the team reached the playoffs. Teams that did not reach the playoffs the previous season are ranked in reverse order of their records (thus the team with the fewest wins is awarded the first selection). Ties between teams with identical records are determined by the following tiebreakers (in order):
#Strength of schedule, which is the combined win–loss record for all 17 of the team&#x27;s opponents in the previous season (ties count as half a win and half a loss). The team with the &quot;lower&quot; strength of schedule (i.e. their opponents compiled fewer wins) is granted the &quot;earlier&quot; pick in round one. (Each game against a division rival is counted separately, so divisional records are weighted double.)
#If any teams are in the same division, the other playoff tiebreakers will be applied in the specified order.
#If any teams are in the same conference, the other playoff tiebreakers will be applied in the specified order.
#If two teams remain from opposing conferences, a series of tiebreakers starting with head-to-head (if one team lost to the other in the previous regular season), win percentage of common games, and strength of victory are applied. Prior to the 2020 NFL draft, interconference ties were only broken by a coin flip.

Teams that reached the playoffs the previous season are then slotted in the order in which they were eliminated as indicated in the table below. Within each tier, the slotting is determined as above (i.e. worst record picks first and the same tiebreakers apply).
Once the order for the first round is determined as described above, the selection order remains the same for subsequent rounds with the exception of teams with identical records within their tier. These tied teams &quot;cycle&quot; picks in each subsequent round. For example, in the 2014 draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all finished 4–12, and selected in that order in the first round (based on the tiebreakers described above). In the second round, Jacksonville cycled to the back of the line with the order becoming Cleveland, Oakland, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and Jacksonville. That cycling continued in each round.

An exception to this ordering strategy occurs when &quot;expansion teams&quot; are added to the league. Any expansion team is automatically granted the first selection; if there are two or more expansion teams added, a coin toss (for two expansion teams) or a drawing of lots (for three expansion teams or more) determines which team is awarded the first selection in the regular draft. The winner of the coin toss (or of the drawing of lots in the event there are three or more expansion teams) is awarded the first selection in the expansion draft. Similarly, the order of compensatory picks generally does not follow the standard draft order.

====Timing====
Each team has its representatives attend the draft. During the draft, one team is always &quot;on the clock.&quot; Teams have 10 minutes to make their choice in the first round, seven minutes in the second round, five minutes in the third through sixth rounds, and four minutes in the seventh round. Until 2007, the limits were 15 minutes in the first round, 10 minutes in the second, and 5 minutes for all subsequent rounds. The time for seventh-round selections was shortened from five to four minutes in 2015. If a team does not make a decision within its allotted time, the team still can submit its selection at any time after its time is up, but the next team is then free to make a selection, thus possibly &#x27;stealing&#x27; a player the team with the earlier pick may have been considering. This occurred in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings, with the 7th overall pick, were late with their selection. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich and the Carolina Panthers drafted offensive tackle Jordan Gross before the Vikings were able to submit their selection of defensive tackle Kevin Williams. This also happened in 2011; as the Baltimore Ravens were negotiating a trade with the Chicago Bears, their time expired and allowed the Kansas City Chiefs to pick ahead of Baltimore, who were unable to finalize the trade with Chicago.

===Pick trades===
Teams may negotiate with one another both before and during the draft (including when they are not &quot;on the clock&quot;) for the right to pick an additional player in a given round. For example, a team may include draft picks in future drafts in order to acquire a player during a trading period. Teams may also make negotiations during the draft relinquishing the right to pick in a given round for the right to have an additional pick in a later round. Thus teams may have multiple picks or no picks in a given round. Teams are only allowed to trade picks for the next three draft cycles and picks for the subsequent draft cycle become eligible for trading upon the start of the upcoming draft. For example, for the 2022 draft, only picks through the 2024 draft can be traded prior to the draft, and once the 2022 draft starts, picks from the 2025 draft are eligible to be traded.

===Compensatory picks===

In addition to the 32 selections in each of the seven rounds, a total of 32 compensatory selections are awarded to teams based on the players they lost and gained in free agency. The league defines a class of unrestricted free agents as &quot;compensatory free agents&quot; (CFA). Teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they signed in the previous year receive between one and four selections somewhere in the third through seventh rounds, but always at the end of each round. Teams that gain and lose equal numbers of players but lose higher-valued players can also be awarded a single seventh-round pick. Compensatory selections are awarded each year at the NFL annual meeting which is held at the end of March; typically, about three or four weeks before the draft. Compensatory selections can be traded; this began with the 2017 NFL draft.

The placement of selections is determined by a proprietary formula based on the player&#x27;s average annual salary, playing time, and postseason honors with his new team, with salary being the primary factor. So, for example, a team that lost a linebacker who signed for $2.5 million per year in free agency might get a sixth-round compensatory pick, while a team that lost a wide receiver who signed for $5 million per year might receive a fourth-round pick. The formula used prior to the 2020 free agency season was never revealed by the NFL, though observers from outside the NFL were able to reverse engineer it to some degree of certainty. The 2020 CBA explicitly provided the details of a new formula, still based primarily on salary.

On two occasions, 33 compensatory selections have been awarded instead of 32:

* In 2016, the additional pick was awarded (under an agreement between the NFL Management Council and the NFLPA) to the Buffalo Bills for losing Da&#x27;Norris Searcy to free agency and signing Charles Clay as a transition tagged player from the Miami Dolphins, who had not qualified as a CFA.
* In 2021, the NFL announced compensatory selections — the first under a new formula — on March 10. On March 19, it published a revised list after &quot;a correction by the Management Council to the calculation of average yearly compensation.&quot; The revised calculation meant that Damiere Byrd did not qualify as a CFA, giving the New England Patriots an additional fifth-round compensatory pick for Jamie Collins. Rather than remove the last compensatory pick (a sixth-round pick for the Chicago Bears), a 33rd pick was awarded.

If fewer than 32 compensatory selections are awarded, the remainder are awarded after the final Round 7 compensatory selections in the order in which teams would pick in a hypothetical eighth round of the draft; these are known as &quot;supplemental compensatory selections&quot;.

=== 2020 Resolution JC-2A ===
In November 2020, the NFL passed 2020 Resolution JC-2A, which rewards teams for developing minority candidates for head coach or general manager positions. The resolution rewards teams whose minority candidates are hired away for one of those positions by awarding draft picks:

* Two draft picks are awarded if a team has one qualified candidate hired for either a coach or a general manager position.
* Three draft picks are awarded if a team has two qualified candidates hired for both positions, whether by the same team or two different teams.
* These draft picks are at the end of the third round in consecutive years, after standard compensatory picks. For example, the first team to receive such picks, the Los Angeles Rams, received picks in 2021 and 2022 after the Detroit Lions hired their director of college scouting, Brad Holmes, as their general manager.
* if multiple teams qualify in a given year, they are awarded in draft order from the first round. The number of picks awarded via the resolution has no impact on the 32 compensatory picks described above.

The resolution followed moves strengthening the league&#x27;s Rooney Rule to require two minority candidates be interviewed for head coach positions (previously one), and one minority candidate for open coordinator positions (previously not required). It also replaced an earlier resolution that would have rewarded teams for hiring minority candidates rather than for developing them.

===Salaries===
The NFL allows each team a certain amount of money from its salary cap to sign its drafted rookies for their first season. That amount is based on an undisclosed formula that assigns a certain value to each pick in the draft; thus, having more picks, or earlier picks, will increase the allotment. In 2008 the highest allotment was about $8.22 million for the Kansas City Chiefs, who had 12 picks, including two first-rounders, while the lowest was the $1.79 million for the Cleveland Browns who had only five picks, and none in the first three rounds. The exact mechanism for the rookie salary cap is set out in the NFL&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). (Those numbers represent the cap hits that each rookie&#x27;s salary may contribute, not the total amount of money paid out.)

The drafted players are paid salaries commensurate with the position in which they were drafted. High first-round picks get paid the most, and low-round picks get paid the least. There is a de facto pay scale for drafted rookies. After the draft, non-drafted rookies may sign a contract with any team in the league. These rookie free-agents are not usually paid as well as drafted players, nearly all of them signing for the predetermined rookie minimum and a small signing bonus.

Two other facets of the rookie salary cap affect the makeup of rosters. First, the base salaries of rookie free agents do &quot;not&quot; count towards the rookie salary cap, though certain bonuses do. Second, if a rookie is traded, his cap allotment remains with the team that originally drafted him, which make trades involving rookie players relatively rare. (This rule does not apply, however, to rookies that are waived by the teams that drafted them.)

Teams used to be able to agree to a contract with a draft-eligible player before the draft itself starts. They could only do this if they have the first overall pick, as by agreeing to terms with a player the team has already &quot;selected&quot; which player they will draft. The last example of this was quarterback Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions in the 2009 NFL draft: the Lions picked Stafford with the first overall selection in the draft, and had agreed to a six-year, $78 million deal ($41.7 million guaranteed) with Stafford a day before the draft officially started.

Since 2011, all rookies that are drafted, even those drafted first overall, now have their compensation and duration predetermined each year before the draft occurs, and can no longer negotiate beforehand.

===Forfeiture===
The NFL commissioner has the authority to forfeit picks any team is allotted in a draft for rules violations. A total of 28 selections have been forfeited since 1980 for 23 rules violations by 15 teams, while three other selections have been moved down from their original position. The New England Patriots have been the most penalized team, losing five draft picks for four violations. The Denver Broncos, Las Vegas Raiders (as the Oakland Raiders), New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers have each committed two violations. The Pittsburgh Steelers, who have forfeited only one pick since 1980 (a third rounder in 2001 due to trying to circumvent the salary cap involving offensive lineman Will Wolford in 1998), have also forfeited multiple picks, with the other one coming in the form of a third-rounder in 1979 for the now-infamous 1978 Shouldergate controversy. Teams selecting a player in a supplemental draft will forfeit the corresponding selection in the following year&#x27;s NFL draft.

===Team policies===
Teams vary greatly in their selection methodologies. Owners, general managers, coaches, and others may or may not participate. For example, in the 1983 draft, Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; head coach Chuck Noll had what team executive Art Rooney, Jr. later described as &quot;the final say&quot; over picks, even over his father, team owner Art Rooney. This infamously led to the team drafting Gabriel Rivera over Rooney&#x27;s favorite, local product and Oakland (Pittsburgh) native Dan Marino, which later came back to haunt the Steelers due to Rivera only playing six games before becoming paralyzed in a drunk-driving crash. Terry Bradshaw&#x27;s sudden retirement the following year and Marino&#x27;s eventual Hall of Fame career with the Dolphins lead to the elder Rooney reminding his sons daily until his death in 1988 that the team &quot;should&#x27;ve drafted Marino&quot;.

New England Patriots head coach Ron Meyer, by contrast, later stated that the team, led by owner Billy Sullivan, excluded the coaching staff from any personnel-related decisions, even prohibiting him from reading scouting reports. Meyer claimed that had he possessed the decision-making authority, he would not have chosen Tony Eason in the first round of the 1983 draft.

===Festivities and attendance===
The draft was first televised in 1980 by ESPN. It would subsequently develop into a major U.S. television event though through the 2014 edition, in-person attendance remained relatively small. Between 1965 and 2014, the draft was held entirely in venues within New York City. However, the NFL grew frustrated with its longtime host venue, Radio City Music Hall, when the 2014 needed to be scheduled later than planned in the year due to a scheduling conflict at the venue; this prompted the league to open bidding for a new site to host its 2015 draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell selected the city of Chicago over Los Angeles. To host the 2015 event, Chicago reimagined the draft into a much larger event than it previously had been, making the event accessible to large public attendance. While the first three rounds of the draft itself still took place inside an indoor venue (the Auditorium Theatre), across the street from the theater in Grant Park Chicago erected a large free-admission multi-day fan festival dubbed &quot;Draft Town&quot; that drew 200,000 visitors. Within the grounds of the festival, fans could watch live footage of the first three rounds draft from within the festival, and the final round of the draft was held in an area of the festival dubbed &quot;Selection Square&quot;. The NFL has retained the large-scale attendance and festivities pioneered when Chicago hosted. The 2024 draft in Detroit set the all-time attendance record with more than 775,000.

==Events leading up to the draft==

===NFL Draft Advisory Board decisions===

College football players who are considering entering the NFL draft but who still have eligibility to play football can request an expert opinion from the NFL-created Draft Advisory Board. The Board, composed of scouting experts and team executives, makes a prediction as to the likely round in which a player would be drafted. This information, which has proven to be fairly accurate, can help college players determine whether to enter the draft or to continue playing and improving at the college level. There are also many famous reporting scouts, such as Mel Kiper Jr.

===NFL Scouting Combine===

The NFL Scouting Combine is a six-day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. College football players perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO, and Quadra Scouting services in 1977 to the media frenzy it has become today.
Athletes attend by invitation only. Implications of one&#x27;s performance during the Combine can affect perception, draft status, salary, and ultimately his career. The draft has popularized the term &quot;Workout Warrior&quot; (sometimes known as a &quot;Workout Wonder&quot;), describing an athlete who, based on superior measurables such as size, speed, and strength, has increased his &quot;draft stock&quot; despite having a possibly average or subpar college career.

===Pro Day===
Each university has a Pro Day, during which the NCAA allows NFL scouts to visit the school and watch players participate in NFL Scouting Combine-like events and drills. Some smaller universities join with nearby schools. They are essentially job fairs for prospective NFL players.

===Pre-draft visits===
Each NFL team is allowed to transport a maximum of 30 draft-eligible players for the purposes of physical examinations, interviews, and written tests. If a player attends a school or grew up in the same &quot;metropolitan area&quot; as the team that is inviting the player, that visit is not counted towards the 30-player limit.

=== All-Star games and events ===
Up until the 2023 season only Seniors or graduates students could participate in the all-star games, but for the 2024 NFL draft the league eased its rules to allow juniors to participate in three college football postseason all-star games: the Senior Bowl, East–West Shrine Bowl and the HBCU Legacy Bowl, while all other all-star games will not be allowed to invite underclassmen.
==== Senior Bowl ====
The Senior Bowl takes place 3–4 weeks after the NCAA Division I Football Championship in Mobile, Alabama. The purpose of this game is for college football players to show off their skills for NFL scouts. Kevin Faulk, Von Miller, Dak Prescott, Phillip Rivers, and Patrick Willis were some of the players who had successful NFL careers after playing in the Senior Bowl.

==== East-West Shrine Bowl ====

Started in 1925, the East-West Shrine Bowl is the oldest running college all-star game. The game is played by college players who plan on joining the NFL draft. The East-West Shrine Bowl gives coaches and players an opportunity to show off their abilities and learn from NFL coaches and players, and also raises money for Shriners Hospitals for Children. Popular East-West Shrine Bowl alumni include Tom Brady, John Elway, and Brett Favre.

==== HBCU Legacy Bowl ====

Started at 2022, it&#x27;s intended for NFL draft-eligible players from historically black colleges and universities (HBCU). The game is played at Yulman Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana and it&#x27;s usually the last all-star game in the draft cycle. It&#x27;s also hosts the NFL&#x27;s HBCU Combine, which was previously held at the Senior Bowl.

==== Hula Bowl ====

A Hawaii based post-season college football all-star game held annually, usually in January, with the purpose that players to show off their skills for NFL scouts. Some popular Hula Bowl alumni are Mike Ditka, Larry Csonka, Jack Ham and Dan Marino.

==== Tropical Bowl ====

Held since 2016 in Florida, with over 350 alumni playing in the NFL.

==== College Gridiron Showcase ====

An independently operated annual post-season college football event held since 2015 in Texas for small college players from FCS, NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, and the NAIA. and select players from around the world, designed to get these players in front of NFL teams and other professional leagues. The event originated as a post-season all star game in 2015, but switched to its current drill showcase and &quot;controlled scrimmage&quot; format in 2016. In addition to on-field drills, the event also features educational seminars to educates players on the business side of an pro career.

==== Other smaller events ====
Some of the smaller post-season college football all-star games which are held annually are:
* FCS Bowl and National Bowl Game - Two independently operated annual post-season college football all-star games, played each December in Florida since 2014. The games are open exclusively to NFL draft prospects from FCS and lower divisions (respectively) with both played as a doubleheader.
* Dream Bowl - Held since 2013, is an independent All-Star Showcase for players from the FCS and lower divisions, that sent multiple players to pro leagues. The game is always held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend to celebrate his legacy and to follow after this iconic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. The event was first held in Roanoke, Virginia but since moved to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in Texas. Between 2017 and 2022 it ran a separate event called HBCU Spirit of America Bowl which featured Historically Black Colleges and Universities players and was played a day before the &quot;Dream Bowl&quot;.
* HBCU Pigskin Showdown - A HBCU dedicated all-star game which is played each December in Selma, Alabama since 2021.

==== Past major events ====
* Chicago College All-Star Game - The game was played from 1934 to 1976 (except for 1974, due to that year&#x27;s NFL strike) between the NFL champions and a team of star college seniors from the previous year, and was run by Chicago Tribune. The game was the prominent college all-star game while played. In the 42 College All-Star Games, the defending pro champions won 31, the All-Stars won nine, and two were ties, giving the collegians a winning percentage. The 1976 College All-Star Game remains the last time an NFL team has played any team from outside the league.
* Blue–Gray Football Classic - Annual college football all-star game held in Montgomery, Alabama from 1939 to 2003, usually in late December and often on Christmas Day. The format pitted players who attended college in the states of the former Confederacy, the &quot;Grays&quot;, who wore white jerseys, against players who attended school in the northern half of the country, the &quot;Blues&quot;, who wore blue jerseys, and also sometimes including players from western teams. Both teams wore gray pants. It was the first game who paid players for their participation.
* North–South Shrine Game - Annual postseason college football all-star game played each December from 1948 to 1973 in Miami, Florida, with a final game in 1976 in Pontiac, Michigan. The game was sponsored by the fraternal group Shriners International, with proceeds used to support the Shriners Hospitals for Crippled Children, and was similar game to the East–West Shrine Game, which still active and has been played since 1925.
* Japan Bowl - All-star game played in Japan each January from 1976 to 1993, which showcased East and West all-star teams made up of college football players from the United States. The bowl featured various famous participants, including Heisman Trophy winners Bo Jackson and Ty Detmer, who both received MVP awards. 
* NFLPA Collegiate Bowl - The event was founded in 2012 by the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) as a post-season college football all-star game for NFL draft-eligible college players. Players predominantly, but not exclusively, were from teams within the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Starting with the 2018 edition, the game has been held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The event was established in part to prepare draft-eligible college football players for a career in the NFL. During the week preceding the game, the NFLPA provides an introduction to the players union and educates players on the business side of an NFL career. Current and former NFL players are invited to attend the week&#x27;s events to share their NFL experiences with the draft eligible players. In 2023 the NFLPA decided to cancel the game after 12 years.

==Tickets==
Tickets to the NFL draft are free and made available to fans on a first-come first-served basis. The tickets are distributed at the box office the morning of the draft, one ticket per person.

==Host venues==

===History===
From the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, the draft was held in various Northeastern, Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Western cities with NFL franchises.

Between 1965 and 2014, the NFL held the draft at various venues in New York City. The Theater at Madison Square Garden hosted the event for a ten-year period from 1995 to 2004, before it was moved to Javits Convention Center in 2005 following a dispute with the Cablevision-owned arena, who were opposing the West Side Stadium, which would have served as home of the New York Jets and the centerpiece of the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, because the new stadium would have competed with the Garden for concerts and other events. The draft was then held at Radio City Music Hall from 2006 to 2014.

Starting in 2015, the league opened the draft location to a bidding process. Chicago won the bidding in both 2015 and 2016, hosting the draft for the first time since 1964. These drafts marked the transformation of the draft into an event featuring festivities and attendance by large public crowds. After these drafts in Chicago, the NFL has held the draft in different cities each year.

The 2020 draft was originally scheduled to be held in Las Vegas, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was held virtually with team coaches and GMs conducting it via phone and internet.

==Supplemental draft==
Since 1977, the NFL has also held a supplemental draft to accommodate players who did not enter the regular draft. Players generally enter the supplementary draft because they missed the filing deadline for the NFL draft or because issues developed which affected their eligibility (such as academic or disciplinary matters). The supplemental draft is scheduled to occur at some point after the regular draft and before the start of the next season. In 1984, the NFL held a supplemental draft for players who were under contract with USFL and CFL teams.

Draft order is determined by a weighted system that is divided into three groupings. First come the teams that had six or fewer wins last season, followed by non-playoff teams that had more than six wins, followed by the 12 (now 14) playoff teams. In the supplemental draft, a team is not required to use any picks. Instead, if a team wants a player in the supplemental draft, they submit a &quot;bid&quot; to the Commissioner with the round they would pick that player. If no other team places a bid on that player at an earlier spot, the team is awarded the player and has to give up an equivalent pick in the following year&#x27;s draft. (For example, FS Paul Oliver was taken by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round of the supplemental draft in 2007; thus, in the 2008 NFL draft, the Chargers forfeited a fourth-round pick.)

The 1985 supplemental draft was particularly controversial. Quarterback Bernie Kosar who had led the University of Miami to its first national championship in 1983 was earning his academic degree as a junior. Rather than finish his eligibility at Miami he wanted to turn pro. At this time college players had to wait for their class unless they themselves graduated early.

Football agent AJ Faigin devised a plan to get Kosar to his preferred team, the Cleveland Browns. Faigin was representing former University of Miami QB Jim Kelly, then in the USFL, but whose NFL rights were held by the Buffalo Bills. The USFL was in its last days and Kelly would soon be available to the Bills. Faigin&#x27;s first step was to ask Bill Polian, the GM of Buffalo, if he would be willing to trade the number one supplemental pick (worth next to nothing at that time) to Cleveland. Polian agreed and Faigin told the Cleveland Browns a trade was available. He next notified Kosar&#x27;s father he should not formally submit his son&#x27;s application for the standard NFL draft that was weeks away and declare only afterward; which would put him into the supplemental draft.

The result of Kosar&#x27;s withdrawal resulted in rare, open warfare among NFL teams played out in the newspapers with threats of lawsuits between them, notably the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, who had expressed interest in choosing him in that season&#x27;s regular draft. But as no rules were broken the Giants and eventually Minnesota had to back down. Following that season, the NFL instituted the current semi-random supplemental draft order.

The strategy devised by A.J. Faigin, to not declare for the NFL until after the regular draft, was subsequently used by other top players for various reasons. In some cases, it was because they did not want to play for the team that would have drafted them in the regular draft. For example, in 1987, Brian Bosworth did not declare because he did not want to play for the Indianapolis Colts or the Buffalo Bills, the teams who drafted second and third that year. The Colts had offered him a 4-year, $2.2 million deal before the draft. The Seattle Seahawks won the right to draft first in the supplemental draft, and later signed him to a 10-year, $11 million contract. At the time that was the largest rookie contract in NFL history.

As of the 1990 season, only players who had graduated or exhausted their college eligibility were made available for the supplemental draft. Since 1993, only players who had planned to attend college but for various reasons could not, have been included in the supplemental draft.

<text>Hans Hendrik van Paesschen (c. 1510–1582) was a Flemish architect, based in Antwerp, who designed high-style classical buildings in many countries of Northern Europe.

==Life and times==
While Italy had the architecture of Andrea Palladio and France that of Philibert Delorme, a contemporary of theirs, Hans Hendrik van Paesschen, was designing equally beautiful buildings in northern Europe. One of the reasons he is so little known is that in each country where he worked his name was spelled differently.

After presumably receiving his training in Italy, Paesschen established himself in Antwerp as an architect and builder, often using the sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt to secure architectural commissions for him. Paesschen worked in Flanders, the Netherlands, England, Wales, north Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Königsberg. It is also likely that he designed buildings in northeastern France, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but these have so far not been identified.

In sharp contrast to the gothic and mannerist styles being used at the time in northern Europe, Paesschen often designed buildings in a pure Florentine style, but with a northern flavor. He employed arcaded and colonnaded loggias, domes, and Venetian arches on his best buildings. The majority of his buildings have been destroyed or substantially altered, so his work is known mostly through old pictures. Several generations of his descendants in the Van de Passe family were notable engravers, usually with the surname de Pas or van de Passe.

<doc id="710509" wikidata="Q235106" url="?curid=710509" title="Santa Cruz Department">
<text>Santa Cruz () is the largest of the nine constituent departments of Bolivia, occupying about one-third (33.74%) of the country&#x27;s territory. With an area of , it is slightly smaller than Japan or the US state of Montana. It is located in the eastern part of the country, sharing borders in the north and east with Brazil and with Paraguay in the south.

In the 2024 census, it reported a population of 3,115,386 , making it the most populated department. The capital is the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The department is one of the wealthiest departments in Bolivia, with huge reserves of natural gas. Besides, it has experienced the highest increase of economic growth during the last 50 years in Bolivia and South America.

==Government and administration==

According to the current Constitution, the highest authority in the department lies with the governor. The former figure of prefect was appointed by the President of the Republic till 2005, when the prefect for the first time was elected by popular vote to serve for a five-year term. In 2010 the first governor was elected according to the implementation of autonomy after a struggle for almost a decade by the people of Santa Cruz.

Santa Cruz also has a Departmental Assembly &quot;(Asamblea Departamental),&quot; which derives but differs from the previous Departmental Council &quot;(Consejo Departamental).&quot; It is a state legislature with limited legislation powers, being able to make laws in certain subjects in exclusivity and in some others in concurrence with the state legislative branch.

==Economy==
The department covers a vast expanse of territory in eastern Bolivia, much of it rainforests, extending from the Andes to the border with Brazil. The department&#x27;s economy depends largely on agriculture, with sugar, cotton, soybeans and rice being grown. The amount of land cultivated by modern farming techniques is increasing rapidly in the Santa Cruz area, where weather allows for two crops a year.

In recent years, the discovery of natural gas in the department has led to plans for the development of a regional natural gas industry that is likely to boost the local economy.
Bolivia&#x27;s energy minister said two proposed liquefied petroleum gas plants may allow the country to boost supplies to Brazil and Argentina by 2010, easing a shortage of the fuel after a lack of investment reduced output.
The processing plants would be built in Santa Cruz and each would produce about 200 tons of liquefied petroleum gas a day. The plants would help turn a deficit of gas into a “surplus”.

In July 2004, the people voted in a nationwide referendum to allow for regulated exportation of the gas.

The department also hosts El Mutún, the world&#x27;s second largest iron ore reserve (after Carajás in Brazil) and largest magnesium deposits are also located there. Located in the Germán Busch Province in the Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia, near Puerto Suárez, El Mutún extends across the border into Brazil, where it is called the Serrania de Jacadigo. Also known as the &quot;Serrania Mutún&quot;, it has an area of about 75 square kilometers. Its estimated reserves are about 40.205 billion tons of iron ore of 50% iron, mainly in hematite and magnetite form, and in lesser quantities in siderite and manganese minerals. This can be compared with an estimate of the total world reserves of iron ore: 800 billion tons of crude ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.

==Geography==

Santa Cruz Department is the largest of the Bolivian departments and covers a wide and diverse area. In the west lies a series of temperate Sub-Andean ranges and valleys while to the north and south lies two different lowlands areas; the Beni and Chaco lowlands respectively. To the northeast lies the flat Llanos Chiquitanos areas and beyond these the Serranías Chiquitanas ranges. In the far east the departments have small parts of the huge Pantanal wetland.

===Waters===
The rivers of Santa Cruz are part of any of two basins: the Amazon Basin (north) and the Plate Basin (south).

The main rivers in the northern basin are river Iténez, making the border with Brazil, Río Grande, river Piraí and river Itonomas.
In the southern basin, the main rivers are river Paraguay and its tributaries, including river Negro.

The main lakes are lake Mandioré, Uberaba, lake La Gaiba, Laguna de Marfil, Concepción and lake San Jorge.

==Demographics==
The department of Santa Cruz is one of the Bolivian departments with the least indigenous population, and the one with the greatest mestizo and Creole identity. The first settlers of Santa Cruz were mainly Spaniards that accompanied Ñuflo de Chávez, as well as Guarani, and some Flemings, Portuguese, Germans and Italians working for the Spanish crown. Among the first settlers there were also Sephardic Jews recently converted to Christianity who were persecuted by the Inquisition in Spain. Santa Cruz has a multicultural population: 57% are Mestizos with both Indigenous Amazonian and European ascendants, 30% are Natives (Chiquitano, Chane, Ayoreo, as well as Quechua and Aymara internal migrants from other departments.) and 13% are Whites of European descent, of whom about a quarter are so-called &quot;Russian&quot; Mennonites (see Mennonites in Bolivia) of German tradition, language and descent.


== Climate ==
At 416 meters above sea level, it is warm and tropical most of the year. Winters are short and last only 2–3 months but can get very cold very suddenly. &quot;Surazos&quot; (southerly winds that blow in from Argentina) can drop the temperature by as much as 30 degrees overnight. This extreme cold lasts only a few days at a time and the beautiful, sub-tropical Santa Cruz is pleasant throughout most of the year. Here the climate varies by geographical zone: temperate to cold in the western sierras and warm to hot and humid as one descends into the extensive plains.

The department of Santa Cruz regularly experiences devastating forest fires, often started by landowners who want to burn forests to create new agricultural land. This practice puts a great strain on the rich biodiversity of the country.

==Provinces==
The Department of Santa Cruz is divided into 15 provinces.

==Calls for autonomy==

During the later stages of the Chaco war between Paraguay and Bolivia, as the Paraguayan army approached Santa Cruz department, local nationalists backed by a Paraguay-based independence movement sought to create a separate independent state in Santa Cruz department.
A referendum on autonomy was held in Santa Cruz department in 2008. Eastern departments in Bolivia, including Santa Cruz, have majority of the natural gas reserves. Bolivian president Evo Morales was planning to introduce legislation to tackle the poverty in the country using tax revenues from richer departments like Santa Cruz. Additionally, Morales&#x27;s attempts to change the constitution were opposed by the opposition governors who run five of Bolivia&#x27;s nine regions. 85.6 percent voted in favour of autonomy. The Bolivian government considered the referendum illegal.

<text>Marcus Alexander Brigstocke (born 8 May 1973) is a British comedian and actor. He has worked in stand-up comedy, television, radio and musical theatre. He has appeared on many BBC television and radio shows.

==Early life==
Brigstocke is the son of Nick Brigstocke, a stockbroker from a Welsh landed gentry family, and Carol, daughter of senior Royal Air Force officer Air Marshal Sir Walter Pretty. He was raised in Surrey, and educated at St Edmunds School in the village of Hindhead in Surrey, at Westbourne House School in Chichester, West Sussex, King&#x27;s School, Bruton in Somerset, and Hammersmith &amp; Fulham College in west London. He then attended the University of Bristol, where he studied drama, but did not complete his degree.

In his youth, Brigstocke struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.

Aged 19, Brigstocke worked on a North Sea oil rig, and later as a podium dancer (being featured on &quot;Electric Circus&quot;); he used his earnings to travel, and the experiences as inspiration for a stand-up routine. Brigstocke is also a World Cheese Judge and an Academy of Cheese alumnus.

==Live comedy career==
Many of the central themes of Brigstocke&#x27;s work were first addressed during his time as a student at the University of Bristol. While at Bristol he often performed in the comedy trio Club Seals (with Dan Tetsell and Danny Robins), which later made the transition to television in the series of short programmes &quot;We Are History&quot; (2000-2001).

Brigstocke&#x27;s first stand-up comedy DVD, &quot;Planet Corduroy&quot;, was released in November 2007.

In April 2008, Brigstocke and fellow comedian and snowboarder Andrew Maxwell founded a comedy and music festival in the ski resort of Meribel, in the French Alps.

In 2009, Brigstocke starred in the British tour of the American live improvisation show &quot;Totally Looped&quot;. His second stand-up show, &quot;God Collar&quot;, toured in 2009.

In June 2010, he announced that he had signed a publishing deal with Transworld to turn the &quot;God Collar&quot; Tour into a book, which was released in 2011 to mixed reviews.

In 2023, he was the comedy headliner of the may ball at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

==Radio work==
Brigstocke has a radio career including &quot;The Now Show&quot; (1998-2024, with Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis) and &quot;Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off&quot; (2002–2011).

On 9 April 2006, Brigstocke appeared as Bertie Wooster in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot; (1938), with Andrew Sachs as Jeeves. Brigstocke hosted &quot;The Late Edition&quot; (2005–2008), which was promoted by the BBC as &quot;&quot;Newsnight&quot; with jokes&quot;.

Brigstocke has hosted a talk show, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen Star Wars&quot;, on BBC Radio 4 since 2008, transferring it to TV for one series as &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen Star Wars&quot; for BBC Four in 2009.

From 2013 to 2015, he hosted &quot;The Brig Society&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

In September 2017, BBC Radio 4 broadcast his first serious drama, &quot;The Red&quot;, drawing on his own experience of recovery. It won the Best Single Drama award in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2018.

In December 2017, BBC Radio 4 broadcast his new 4-part sitcom, &quot;The Wilsons Save The World&quot;, in which Brigstocke plays a father leading a family trying to live ethically. A second 4-part series followed in 2019.

He took part in the BBC Two programme &quot;Excuse My French&quot; (2006) with Ron Atkinson and Esther Rantzen. They were immersed in the French language by staying in a French town in Provence. Brigstocke&#x27;s ultimate assignment was to perform a live stand-up comedy act in French to a French audience.

In September 2008, Brigstocke was a team captain for the first series of a comedy panel show, &quot;Argumental&quot; (2008-2012), for the British television channel Dave. He was the captain of the Red Team, competing against Rufus Hound with a variety of guest participants, under the chairmanship of John Sergeant.

In 2000, he successfully claimed publishing rights after a sample of his voice was used in the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Smoke&quot; by DJ Dee Kline.

<doc id="710528" wikidata="Q1755657" url="?curid=710528" title="Phoenix Program">
<text>The Phoenix Program () was designed and initially coordinated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Vietnam War, involving the American, South Vietnamese militaries, and a small amount of special forces operatives from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. In 1970, CIA responsibility was phased out, and the program was put under the authority of the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).

The program, which lasted from 1968 to 1972, was designed to identify and destroy the Viet Cong (VC) via infiltration, assassination, torture, capture, counter-terrorism, and interrogation. The CIA described it as &quot;a set of programs that sought to attack and destroy the political infrastructure of the Viet Cong.&quot; The Phoenix Program was premised on the idea that North Vietnamese infiltration had required local support within noncombat civilian populations, which were referred to as the &quot;VC infrastructure&quot; and &quot;political branch&quot; that had purportedly coordinated the insurgency.

Throughout the program, Phoenix &quot;neutralized&quot; 81,740 people suspected of VC membership, of whom 26,369 were killed, and the rest surrendered or were captured. Of those killed 87% were attributed to conventional military operations by South Vietnamese and American forces, while the remaining 13% were attributed to Phoenix Program operatives.

The Phoenix Program was heavily criticized on various grounds, including the number of neutral civilians killed, the nature of the program (which critics have labelled as a &quot;civilian assassination program,&quot;) the use of torture and other coercive methods, and the program being exploited for personal politics. Nevertheless, the program was very successful at suppressing VC political and revolutionary activities. Public disclosure of the program led to significant criticism, including hearings by the US Congress, and the CIA was pressured into shutting it down. A similar program, Plan F-6, continued under the government of South Vietnam.

==Background==
Shortly after the 1954 Geneva Conference and the adoption of the Geneva Accords, the government of North Vietnam organized a force of several thousand to mobilize support for the communists in the upcoming elections. When it became clear that the elections would not take place, these forces became the seeds of what would eventually become the Viet Cong, a North Vietnamese insurgency whose goal was unification of Vietnam under the control of the North.

While counterinsurgency efforts had been ongoing since the first days of US military involvement in Vietnam, they had been unsuccessful with dealing with either the armed VC or the VC&#x27;s civilian infrastructure (VCI) which swelled to between 80,000 and 150,000 members by the mid 1960&#x27;s. The VCI, unlike the armed component of the VC, was tasked with support activities including recruiting, political indoctrination, psychological operations, intelligence collection, and logistical support. The VCI rapidly set up shadow governments in rural South Vietnam by replacing local leadership in small rural hamlets loyal to the Saigon government with communist cadres. The VCI chose small rural villages because they lacked close supervision of the Saigon government or the South Vietnamese Army

VCI tactics for establishing local communist control began by identifying towns and villages with strategic importance to either the VC or North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and local populations with communist sympathies with the Hanoi government putting a great deal of emphasis on the activities and success of the VCI. After a community was identified, the VCI would threaten local leadership with reprisals if they refused to cooperate or kidnap local leaders and send them to reeducation camps in North Vietnam. Local leaders who continued to refuse to cooperate or threatened to contact the Saigon government were murdered along with their families. After VCI agents took control of an area it would be used to quarter and resupply VC guerrillas, supplying intelligence on US and South Vietnamese military movements, providing taxes to VCI cadres, and conscripting locals into the VC.

== History ==
On 9 May 1967 all pacification efforts by the United States came under the authority of the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS). In June 1967, as part of CORDS, the Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation Program (ICEX) was created, from a plan drafted by Nelson Brickham. The purpose of the organization centered on gathering and coordinating information on the VC. In December 1967 the South Vietnamese Prime Minister signed a decree establishing &quot;Phụng Hoàng&quot;, (named after a mythical bird) to coordinate the numerous South Vietnamese entities involved in the anti-VCI campaign. The 1968 Tet Offensive demonstrated the importance of the VCI. In July 1968 South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu signed a decree implementing &quot;Phụng Hoàng&quot;.

The major two components of the program were Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRUs) and regional interrogation centers. PRUs would kill or capture suspected VC members, as well as civilians who were thought to have information on VC activities. Many of these people were taken to interrogation centers and were tortured in an attempt to gain intelligence on VC activities in the area. The information extracted at the centers was given to military commanders, who would use it to task the PRU with further capture and assassination missions. The program&#x27;s effectiveness was measured in the number of VC members who were &quot;neutralized&quot;, a euphemism meaning imprisoned, persuaded to defect, or killed.

The interrogation centers and PRUs were originally developed by the CIA&#x27;s Saigon station chief Peer de Silva. DeSilva was a proponent of a military strategy known as counter-terrorism, which encompasses military tactics and techniques that government, military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies use to combat or prevent terrorist activities, and that it should be applied strategically to &quot;enemy civilians&quot; in order to reduce civilian support for the VC. The PRUs were designed with this in mind, and began targeting suspected VC members in 1964. Originally, the PRUs were known as &quot;Counter Terror&quot; teams, but they were renamed to &quot;Provincial Reconnaissance Units&quot; after CIA officials &quot;became wary of the adverse publicity surrounding the use of the word &#x27;terror.

Officially, Phoenix operations continued until December 1972, although certain aspects continued until the fall of Saigon in 1975.

==Agencies and individuals involved in the program==
* Central Intelligence Agency
* United States special operations forces
* U.S. Army intelligence collection units from the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV—the joint-service command that provided command and control for all U.S. advisory and assistance efforts in Vietnam)
* US Navy SEAL Detachment Bravo
* USMC, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company stationed near Da Nang
* Special forces operatives from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV)
* Republic of Vietnam National Police Field Force

== Operations ==
The chief aspect of the Phoenix Program was the collection of intelligence information. VC members would then be captured, converted, or killed. Emphasis for the enforcement of the operation was placed on local government militia and police forces, rather than the military, as the main operational arm of the program. According to journalist Douglas Valentine, &quot;Central to Phoenix is the fact that it targeted civilians, not soldiers&quot;.

The Phoenix Program took place under special laws that allowed the arrest and prosecution of suspected communists. To avoid abuses such as phony accusations for personal reasons, or to rein in overzealous officials who might not be diligent enough in pursuing evidence before making arrests, the laws required three separate sources of evidence to convict an individual targeted for neutralization. If a suspected VC member was found guilty, they could be held in prison for two years, with renewable two-year sentences totaling up to six years. According to MACV Directive 381-41, the intent of Phoenix was to attack the VC with a &quot;rifle shot rather than a shotgun approach to target key political leaders, command/control elements and activists in the VCI [Viet Cong Infrastructure].&quot; The VCI was known by the communists as the Revolutionary Infrastructure.

Heavy-handed operations—such as random cordons and searches, large-scale and lengthy detentions of innocent civilians, and excessive use of firepower—had a negative effect on the civilian population. Intelligence derived from interrogations was often used to carry out &quot;search and destroy&quot; missions aimed at finding and killing VC members.

87% of those killed during the Phoenix Program were killed in conventional military operations. Many of those killed were only identified as members of the VCI following military engagements, which were often started by the VC. Between January 1970 and March 1971, 94% of those killed as a result of the program were killed during military operations (9,827 out of 10,443 VCI killed).

=== Torture ===
According to Valentine, methods of torture that were utilized at the interrogation centers included:Rape, gang rape, rape using eels, snakes, or hard objects, and rape followed by murder; electrical shock (&quot;the Bell Telephone Hour&quot;) rendered by attaching wires to the genitals or other sensitive parts of the body, like the tongue; &quot;the water treatment&quot;; &quot;the airplane,&quot; in which a prisoner&#x27;s arms were tied behind the back and the rope looped over a hook on the ceiling, suspending the prisoner in midair, after which he or she was beaten; beatings with rubber hoses and whips; and the use of police dogs to maul prisoners.Military intelligence officer K. Barton Osborn reports that he witnessed &quot;the use of the insertion of the 6-inch dowel into the canal of one of my detainee&#x27;s ears, and the tapping through the brain until dead. The starvation to death (in a cage), of a Vietnamese woman who was suspected of being part of the local political education cadre in one of the local villages ... The use of electronic gear such as sealed telephones attached to ... both the women&#x27;s vaginas and men&#x27;s testicles [to] shock them into submission.&quot;

Osborn&#x27;s claims have been refuted by author Gary Kulik, who states that Osborn made exaggerated, contradictory and false claims and that his colleagues stated that he liked making &quot;fantastic statements&quot; and that he &quot;frequently made exaggerated remarks in order to attract attention to himself.&quot; Osborn served with the United States Marine Corps in I Corps in 1967–1968 before the Phoenix Program was implemented. Torture was carried out by South Vietnamese forces with the CIA and special forces playing a supervisory role.

=== Targeted killings ===
Phoenix operations often aimed to assassinate targets or kill them through other means. PRU units often anticipated resistance in disputed areas, and often operated on a shoot-first basis. Lieutenant Vincent Okamoto, an intelligence-liaison officer for the Phoenix Program for two months in 1968 and a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross said the following:

William Colby denied that the program was an assassination program stating: &quot;To call it a program of murder is nonsense ... They were of more value to us alive than dead, and therefore, the object was to get them alive.&quot; His instructions to field officers stated &quot;Our training emphasizes the desirability of obtaining these target individuals alive and of using intelligent and lawful methods of interrogation to obtain the truth of what they know about other aspects of the VCI ... [U.S. personnel] are specifically not authorized to engage in assassinations or other violations of the rules of land warfare.&quot;

== Strategic and operational effect ==
Between 1968 and 1972, Phoenix officially &quot;neutralized&quot; (meaning imprisoned, persuaded to defect, or killed) 81,740 people suspected of VC membership, of whom 26,369 were killed, while Seymour Hersh wrote that South Vietnamese official statistics estimated that 41,000 were killed. A significant number of VC were killed, and between 1969 and 1971, the program was quite successful in destroying VC infrastructure in many important areas. 87 percent of those killed in the program were attributed to conventional military operations by South Vietnamese and American forces; the remainder were killed by Phoenix Program operatives.

By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government&#x27;s pacification program and specifically targeted Phoenix officials. The VC imposed assassination quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near Da Nang in northern South Vietnam instructed their assassins to &quot;kill 1,400 persons&quot; deemed to be government &quot;tyrant[s]&quot; and to &quot;annihilate&quot; anyone involved with the pacification program.

Several North Vietnamese officials have made statements about the effectiveness of Phoenix. According to William Colby, &quot;in the years since 1975, I have heard several references to North and South Vietnamese communists who state that, in their mind, the toughest period that they faced from 1960 to 1975 was the period from 1968 to &#x27;72 when the Phoenix Program was at work.&quot; The CIA said that through Phoenix they were able to learn the identity and structure of the VCI in every province.

According to Stuart A. Herrington: &quot;Regardless of how effective the Phoenix Program was or wasn&#x27;t, area by area, the communists thought it was very effective. They saw it as a significant threat to the viability of the revolution because, to the extent that you could ... carve out the shadow government, their means of control over the civilian population was dealt a death blow. And that&#x27;s why, when the war was over, the North Vietnamese reserved &quot;special treatment&quot; for those who had worked in the Phoenix Program. They considered it a mortal threat to the revolution.&quot;

== Public response and legal proceedings ==
The Phoenix Program was not generally known during most of the time it was operational to either the American public or American officials in Washington. In 1970, author Frances FitzGerald made several arguments to then-U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger against the program, which she alludes to in Fire in the Lake. One of the first people to criticize Phoenix publicly was Ed Murphy, a peace activist and former military intelligence soldier, in 1970.

There was eventually a series of U.S. Congressional hearings. In 1971, in the final day of hearing on &quot;U.S. Assistance Programs in Vietnam&quot;, Osborn described the Phoenix Program as a &quot;sterile depersonalized murder program.&quot; Consequently, the military command in Vietnam issued a directive that reiterated that it had based the anti-VCI campaign on South Vietnamese law, that the program was in compliance with the laws of land warfare, and that U.S. personnel had the responsibility to report breaches of the law.

Former CIA analyst Samuel A. Adams, in an interview with CBC News, talked about the program as basically an assassination program that also included torture. They would also kill people by throwing them out of helicopters to threaten and intimidate those they wanted to interrogate. While acknowledging that &quot;No one can prove the null hypothesis that no prisoner was ever thrown from a helicopter,&quot; Gary Kulik states that &quot;no such story has ever been corroborated&quot; and that the noise inside a helicopter would make conducting an interrogation impossible.

According to Nick Turse, abuses were common. In many instances, rival Vietnamese would report their enemies as &quot;VC&quot; in order to get U.S. troops to kill them. In many cases, &quot;Phung Hoang&quot; chiefs were incompetent bureaucrats who used their positions to enrich themselves. Phoenix tried to address this problem by establishing monthly neutralization quotas, but these often led to fabrications or, worse, false arrests. In some cases, district officials accepted bribes from the VC to release certain suspects.

After Phoenix Program abuses began receiving negative publicity, the program was officially shut down, although it continued under the name &quot;Plan F-6&quot; with the government of South Vietnam in control.

<text>Templeogue is a southwestern suburb of Dublin in Ireland. It lies between the River Poddle and River Dodder, and is about halfway from Dublin&#x27;s centre to the mountains to the south.

==Geography==
=== Location ===
Templeogue is from Dublin city centre to the north, from the Dublin Mountains to the south, and from the coast at Dublin Bay, on the Irish Sea. It is above sea level and occupies an area of .

Suburbs adjacent to Templeogue are Ballyroan, Firhouse, Greenhills, Kimmage, Knocklyon, Perrystown, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, and Terenure.

=== Transport ===
The three main routes through the suburb are the R112 regional road (Templeville Road), the R137 regional road (Templeogue Road), and the R817 regional road (Cypress Grove Road and Wainsfort Road). The M50 motorway borders the suburb to the west.

Dublin Bus operates the following bus routes through Templeogue: 15, 15A, 15B, 15D, 49, 54A, 65, 65B and 150.

===Natural features===
The River Dodder forms a natural southern border with Rathfarnham and Knocklyon, while the River Poddle forms the northern border with Greenhills and Kimmage. The historical artificial watercourse from the Dodder at Firhouse to the Poddle passed through Templeogue.

Prominent views from Templeogue are of Montpelier Hill to the southwest, topped by the ruin of the Hellfire Club at , and of Three Rock Mountain (450 m), topped by transmitter masts, to the southeast.

==Etymology==
The original Irish language name (&quot;new chapel&quot;) refers to a chapel that was built there in about 1273.

==History==
Templeogue was originally a village in the rural, southern part of County Dublin.

In Elizabethan times it was owned by the Talbot family, who later became prominent as the owners of Mount Talbot. The Talbot&#x27;s estate was forfeited to the Crown on the Restoration of Charles II.

In the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was owned by the Domviles. The Domviles effectively had some control over the canal drawn from the Dodder to the Poddle, which passed through their estates- at that time it provided Dublin&#x27;s main drinking water supply, as well as critical power for multiple watermills.
An illustration of the Doric temple at Templeogue House by Gabriel Beranger from around 1751 illustrates the grounds of the Domville estate as it would have looked when lived in by Sir Compton Domvile, 2nd Baronet. The temple was later moved to another family property, Santry Court, along with a number of other follies in 1781 when Charles Domvile vacated the estate as the house had fallen into disrepair. Today Templeogue House still contains many of the original features and is one of the oldest structures in the area.

In 1801, the Templeogue Road was constructed, originally as a toll road.

Urban expansion of Dublin during the 1950s and &#x27;60s absorbed the village.

== Amenities ==

=== Schools ===

The local schools are St. Pius X National School, Our Lady&#x27;s Secondary School, Templeogue College, St. Mac Dara&#x27;s Community College, Bishop Galvin National School, Bishop Shanahan National School, and Ashfield College.

=== Sports ===

Local sports facilities are Faughs GAA Club, St. Judes GAA Club, St. Mary&#x27;s College RFC, Templeogue Swimming Club, Templeogue Tennis Club, and Templeogue United Football Club.

=== Shops and services ===

Shops, restaurants, and small business services are located in the village on Templeogue Road, as well as in Fortfield Park, Cypress Park, Wainsfort Drive, Orwell Shopping Centre, and Rathfarnham Shopping Centre.

Although surrounded by pubs in adjacent neighbourhoods, Templeogue has only one pub inside its boundaries, The Templeogue Inn, also known as The Morgue. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway passed through Templeogue so close to the pub that pedestrians were sometimes hit. Some corpses were sheltered in the pub until taken away and the pub acquired the permanent, morbid nickname. The Templeogue Inn was, for a while, the most expensive pub in Ireland when it changed hands on 12 October 1983 for IR£660,000, a remarkable sum at the time.

=== Churches ===

The Roman Catholic parish church is St. Pius X which opened on 27 November 1960 on College Drive. A historical chapel was built in the 13th century beside the graveyard which survives at Wellington Lane, where the original village of Templeogue was located.

St. Jude&#x27;s church was built at Orwell Park on 7 December 1975 to serve the newer housing estates of Orwell, Willington, Rossmore and surrounding areas.

==Politics and administration==

Templeogue straddles two Dáil constituencies, with five of its electoral divisions (Templeogue-Cypress, Templeogue-Limekiln, Templeogue-Orwell, Templeogue-Osprey, and Templeogue Village) in the Dublin South-West constituency, and one electoral division (Templeogue-Kimmage Manor) is in Dublin South-Central.

It is administered by South Dublin County Council, and its local electoral area for county council elections is Rathfarnham–Templeogue.

Templeogue is part of the Dublin 6W postal district.

==Population==
Templeogue&#x27;s population at the 2022 census was 18,076, a rise of 3.9 percent from the previous 2016 census. In the 36 years from 1986 to 2022, the population fell by 1,566, a decrease of 8 percent.

The author James Joyce, who was born 2km to the northeast in Rathgar, refers to Templeogue in his novel, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

The poet Austin Clarke lived in Bridge House beside Templeogue Bridge, which spans the River Dodder. After his death, there was a proposal to preserve the house and his library of 6,500 books as a memorial. This was not possible owing to long-term plans to demolish the house and widen the road. The old Templeogue Bridge, built in 1800, and Bridge House were removed and a new bridge at the same location was opened by Councillor Mrs. Bernie Malone, Chairman Dublin City Council on 11 December 1984, which was renamed Austin Clarke Bridge in his honour.

The novelists Mary Beckett, Charles Lever, and Flora Shaw resided in Templeogue as did journalists Ursula Halligan and Michael Mills, and radio music host Larry Gogan.

=== Sculpture ===
An outdoor bronze sculpture in Templeogue Village, &quot;Love All&quot; by Irish artist Rachel Joynt, was unveiled by the mayor of South Dublin, Billy Gogarty, on 14 July 2007. Commissioned by the South Dublin County Council and installed near the Templeogue Tennis Club, the 1.1metre artwork depicts a tennis ball which, on closer scrutiny, reveals a miniature world including streets, road traffic, houses, people, and mountains, and the seam of the tennis ball resembles a winding river with bridges, inspired by the local River Dodder. The tennis-ball world rotates on its axle like a globe on its axis, when pushed.

<doc id="710537" wikidata="Q1972395" url="?curid=710537" title="Moate">
<text>Moate (; ) is a town in County Westmeath, Ireland. As of the 2022 census, it had a population of 3,013.

The town&#x27;s Irish name, &quot;An Móta&quot;, is derived from the term motte-and-bailey, as the Normans built an example of this type of fortification here. The earthwork is still visible behind the buildings on the main street.

The town later became an important marketplace and Quaker village. It made the town more wealthy than equivalent towns in Leinster. There are several extant examples of Quaker houses on the main street, which itself is typical of an Irish marketplace.

==Location==
Moate is on the Cloghatanny River, also known as the Moate Stream, which is a tributary of the River Brosna. The confluence between the Cloghatanny and Brosna is to the southeast of Moate.

The town is on the R446 road between Kinnegad and Athlone. Before July 2008, this was the N6 road, a national primary route, and Moate was a serious traffic bottleneck. The new M6 motorway bypasses the town.

== Amenities ==
Moate, which doubled in population (from 1,520 to 3,013) between the 2002 and 2022 census, is home to a number of businesses, several supermarkets, a post office, pharmacy, coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and a hotel. The area also has an amenity and heritage park, a greenway running through the town, golf club, tennis courts, sports pitch, a pastoral centre and a community centre.

===Parks===
Dún na Sí Amenity and Heritage Park is a community park located on the outskirts of the town, encompassing ecology, play, heritage, arts and education. The park comprises the &quot;Scéal Exhibition&quot; in the &quot;Comhaltas Teach Cheoil&quot;, heritage trail, sensory garden, pet farm, walking trails, native Irish woodland, turlough, playground and tea rooms.

Another park, Patrick Kelly Memorial Park, opened in December 2008. This memorial park is named after the only Irish soldier to die in combat in Ireland since the end of the Irish Civil War. On 16 December 1983, Private Patrick Kelly, who was from Moate, was attempting to free American businessman Don Tidey, who had been kidnapped by the Irish Republican Army. Along with Garda recruit Gary Sheehan, he was killed in a shoot-out with IRA gunmen at Derrada Woods in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.

==Culture and heritage==

The local Gaelic football club is the Moate All Whites. The club&#x27;s name and playing kit colours are based on the white religious habits worn by the Carmelite White Friars, a long established Moate institution.

Tuar Ard Arts Centre is a community-lead project which opened in October 2000. The centre has tiered seating in an auditorium that seats 173 people.

The former gaol, part of the old courthouse, contains a small museum housing artefacts found in the area dating from the Stone Age through to the modern era. The main building of the old courthouse has been renovated into a public library.
A 17th-century ruined Quaker Meetinghouse stands in the centre of the town, the Church of St. Patrick serves as the Catholic parish church and the Church of St. Mary is the local Church of Ireland church. A second Catholic church, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, stands to the north of the town.

==Transport==

===Bus===
Bus Éireann and Irish Citylink operate Dublin–Galway bus routes that service Moate.

===Rail===
The disused Moate railway station was built by the Midland Great Western Railway to connect Dublin and Galway and opened on 1 August 1851. It closed for goods traffic on 2 December 1974, and closed for passenger traffic on 27 January 1987. Parts of the film &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot; (1979) were filmed on the local railway. The crew of about 150 actors, extras, and production team, spent around two weeks in and around Moate filming. The cast of the movie stayed at the Royal Hoey Hotel during this time. The train station depicted as &quot;Ashford&quot; is actually Moate Station.

===Dublin to Galway Cycleway===
The Mullingar (West) to Garrycastle (Athlone East) section of the Dublin-Galway Greenway (cycleway) was opened on 3 October 2015 by the Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Moate. The cycleway links Moate to Athlone and Mullingar on a 3m wide 40 km long cycleway.

==Climate==
== Education ==
=== Primary ===
Moate has two primary schools: St. Brigid&#x27;s Primary School on Station Road, formerly known as Convent Primary School, is co-educational and was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1861. The other is St. Oliver Plunkett Boys&#x27; Primary School on Lake Road.

=== Secondary ===
The town&#x27;s secondary school is Moate Community School on Church Street. It was created on September 1, 1996 by combining three schools: the Convent of Mercy Secondary School, the Carmelite College secondary school, and Moate Vocational School. A new building opened in the school in 2002 containing a gymnasium, four new science laboratories, a home economics room, art room, lecture hall, technical drawing classroom and an oratory as well as general classrooms and offices. It has approximately 1,250 students (including Moate Business College) and a staff of 130. The business college provides courses including performance arts and information technology.

<text>Ballyhaunis () is a town in County Mayo, Ireland. It is at the crossroads of the N60 and N83 National secondary roads and on the railway line linking Dublin to Westport and Ballina. Ballyhaunis is within both the Roman Catholic and civil parishes of Annagh.

It is thought that the town grew up around St Mary&#x27;s Augustinian Friary (popularly referred to as &quot;the Abbey&quot;), which was founded in 1348, according to local tradition. The town and its hinterland contain a number of megalithic monuments.

Farming, private business and industry are the main sources of employment. As of the 2022 census, Ballyhaunis had a population of 2,773.

==History==
===War of Independence===
On 2 August 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambushed a British Army lorry on the Claremorris road from Ballyhaunis, seizing weapons and ammunition. The spot of the ambush, known as the Holywell Ambush, is marked by a high cross.

On 1 April 1921, Sean Corcoran, O/C of the IRA&#x27;s East Mayo Brigade, was shot dead by British soldiers after a short gunfight at Crossard crossroads (6 km north of Ballyhaunis). A cross marks the spot where Corcoran died. Later that same day, a member of the Black and Tans was killed by the IRA in the town. In retaliation, the Black and Tans executed Michael Coen, a local man who was an IRA volunteer. Coen is believed not to have taken part in any of the preceding incidents. A monument to Coen was placed on the Cloonfad/Galway road from Ballyhaunis. In May 1921, Patrick Boland, captain of the Corssard Coy, IRA, was killed by crown forces.

===1990s===
In 1999, Ballyhaunis was one of several locations in the European Union selected to trial a local currency project, known as the ROMA, designed to develop the local economy and ease the transition to the euro.

==Protected buildings==
According to Mayo County Council, four buildings in the town are protected under Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000. These protected structures include:
* St Patrick&#x27;s Parish Church (a Roman Catholic church).
* The former St Joseph&#x27;s Convent.
* St. Mary&#x27;s Augustinian Friary.
* The Ulster Bank.

==Demographics==

According to the 2016 census, Ballyhaunis had a population of 2,366. This had increased to 2,773 by the time of the 2022 census.

As of the 2011 census, non-Irish nationals made up 42% of the population, which was much higher than the national average and the highest of any town in Ireland. Poles and Pakistanis made up the largest groups of immigrants. As of 2015, ethnic Irish people made up approximately 40% of the population.

In terms of religion, the 2016 census indicated that Catholicism was the most common religion (with 1,410 of 2,366 indicating that they were Catholic). There are two Roman Catholic churches in the town. It also has one of the highest proportions of Muslims in Ireland, representing approximately 23% of the town&#x27;s population as of the 2016 census. Ballyhaunis is home to Ireland&#x27;s first purpose-built mosque, the first mosque in Ireland outside Dublin. 

==Media==
MidWest Radio is based at Ballyhaunis, and is a local radio station for Counties Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim. Ballyhaunis also has a dedicated internet radio station, Midwest Irish Radio.

&quot;Annagh Magazine&quot; is an annual publication that appears each December, containing material of local interest. It was established by Ballyhaunis Junior Chamber in 1977, and named after the local parish. The first edition was published at Christmas 1978. It includes articles about local events over the past year, as well as contributions covering Ballyhaunis history and culture.

==Education==
The town has a single primary school and secondary school; the co-educational primary school was formed by the merging of the town&#x27;s original two primary schools, St Mary&#x27;s Boys&#x27; National School and St Joseph&#x27;s Girls&#x27; National School, to form Scoil Iosa National School. Ballyhaunis Community School, as was the case with a lot of community schools, was based on the merging of three schools that previously existed independently, St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent Secondary School, Ballyhaunis Vocational School, and St. Patrick&#x27;s College; the school first opened in September 1977.

==Transport==
===Bus===
The town is connected by Expressway bus route 64 which serves Galway and Derry via Sligo.

===Rail===
The area is served by Ballyhaunis railway station, a station on the Dublin–Westport rail service. The station opened on 1 October 1861, and its 150th anniversary was celebrated by a Ballyhaunis Railway Station-themed edition of the local &quot;Annagh Magazine&quot; in 2011.

==Sports==
Ballyhaunis GAA is the main sporting team in the town, fielding teams in both Gaelic football and hurling. Other sports played in Ballyhaunis include rugby, boxing, cricket, and soccer, and the town has three GAA pitches, two football pitches, two rugby pitches, a football astro pitch, a football and basketball court and a cricket training pitch.

<text>Martin Sam Milner (December 28, 1931 – September 6, 2015) was an American actor and radio host. He is best known for his performances on two television series: &quot;Route 66&quot;, which aired on CBS from 1960 to 1964, and &quot;Adam-12&quot;, which aired on NBC from 1968 to 1975.

==Early years==
Milner was born on December 28, 1931, in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Mildred (née Martin), a Paramount Theater circuit dancer, and Sam Gordon Milner, who worked as a construction hand and later a film distributor. Sam was a Polish-Jewish immigrant. The family left Detroit when Milner was a young child, moved frequently, and settled in Seattle, Washington by the time he was nine. There he became involved in acting, first in school, and then in a children&#x27;s theater group at the Cornish Playhouse.

When Milner was a teenager, he moved with his family to Los Angeles where his parents hired an acting coach and later an agent for him. Milner had his first screen test and began his film career with his debut in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947). Less than two weeks after that film was completed in August 1946, Milner contracted polio. He recovered within a year and had bit parts in two more films, then was graduated from North Hollywood High School in 1949. He immediately landed a minor role in the film &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; starring John Wayne.

==Career==
Milner attended the University of Southern California where he studied theater. He dropped out after a year in the fall of 1950 to concentrate on acting. He made his first television appearance in 1950 as a guest star in episode 28, &quot;Pay Dirt&quot;, of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. The same year, he began a recurring role as Drexel Potter on the sitcom &quot;The Stu Erwin Show&quot;.

He had several more roles, both minor and major, in war films in the 1950s, including another John Wayne picture titled &quot;Operation Pacific&quot; (1951) and &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955), with William Powell and Henry Fonda, James Cagney and Jack Lemmon. On the set of &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1950), he met and befriended actor Jack Webb, and he began intermittent work on Webb&#x27;s radio series &quot;Dragnet&quot;.

In 1952, Milner began a two-year stint in the United States Army. Assigned to Special Services at Fort Ord on California&#x27;s Monterey Bay Peninsula, he directed training films and was both an M.C. and performer in skits for a touring unit created to entertain soldiers. Milner was encouraged by fellow soldier and future actor David Janssen to pursue an acting career when his time in the Army ended. Janssen and Milner served at Fort Ord with fellow future actors Clint Eastwood and Richard Long. While in the Army, Milner continued working for Jack Webb, playing Officer Bill Lockwood (briefly the partner of Sgt. Friday) and other characters on the &quot;Dragnet&quot; radio series on weekends. He also appeared on six episodes of Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; television series between 1952 and 1955.

After his military service ended, Milner had a recurring role on &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; from 1953 to 1958. He also made guest appearances on numerous television shows, including episodes of &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;NBC Matinee Theater&quot;, &quot;The West Point Story&quot;, &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (Season 3, Episode 13, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (episode: &quot;Mirror Image&quot;), &quot;Wagon Train&quot; and &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

Milner was under contract at Hecht-Lancaster, Burt Lancaster&#x27;s production company. He also acted in films, including &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot; (1955), &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955), &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; (1958), where he was able to draw on his Jewish roots playing the role of Wally Wronkin, &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959), and &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; (1960). He later costarred in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), based on the best-selling novel by Jacqueline Susann.

===&quot;Route 66&quot;===

In 1960, Milner was cast as Tod Stiles on the television series &quot;Route 66&quot;, which ran from 1960 to 1964. Created by Stirling Silliphant, &quot;Route 66&quot; is about two regular but distinctly different young men in a car touring the United States. After the sudden death of his father left him penniless, save for a new Chevrolet Corvette, Milner&#x27;s character travels across the United States in the Corvette, taking a variety of odd jobs along the way and getting involved in other people&#x27;s problems. His traveling partner on his escapades is his friend Buz Murdock (played by George Maharis), a former employee of his father&#x27;s. During the series&#x27; third season, Glenn Corbett replaced Maharis, who claimed he was ill with hepatitis but later verified he wanted to break away to pursue other career opportunities. The show never regained its audience appeal with Corbett and was cancelled after a year.

&quot;Route 66&quot; was shot on location, so Milner spent nearly four years traveling the US for the series, sometimes taking his wife and children along.

Milner appeared on Broadway once in the short-lived comedy &quot;The Ninety Day Mistress&quot; in 1967.

===&quot;Adam-12&quot;===
By the mid-1960s, Milner and Jack Webb had a long-established working relationship. Milner had appeared in numerous episodes of both the radio and television versions of the series &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and had worked with Webb in the films &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1950) and &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1955).

In 1968, Milner returned to television as seven-year LAPD veteran uniform patrol Officer Pete Malloy in &quot;Adam-12&quot;, a Webb-produced police drama. Kent McCord played his partner, rookie Officer Jim Reed. The series ran from 1968 to 1975. Like Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot;, it was based on real Los Angeles Police Department procedures and cases.

Milner was Webb&#x27;s choice for Malloy in part because of his relative youth and prior acting credits and because of his on-camera driving experience from his days on &quot;Route 66&quot;. He guest-starred in three episodes of &quot;Emergency!&quot; between 1972 and 1976, during and after &quot;Adam-12&quot;″s run on NBC, the first of which, and the best known, was the pilot movie &quot;The Wedsworth-Townsend Act&quot;.

===Later career===

In 1971, Milner portrayed the murder victim in the premiere episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; titled &quot;Murder by the Book&quot;. After &quot;Adam-12&quot;, Milner starred as Karl Robinson in a television series version of &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1975–1976), produced by Irwin Allen. Most of his later work was as a guest star, including &quot;MacGyver&quot; (as the protagonist&#x27;s father); &quot;Airwolf&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; and &quot;&quot;. In 1983, Milner hosted a morning radio wake-up show on AM 600 KOGO in San Diego.

In 1990, Milner teamed again with Kent McCord in the cable TV-movie &quot;Nashville Beat&quot; (1990), on The Nashville Network. The story was co-written by McCord, who played an LAPD detective who works with his former partner, played by Milner, in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1992, Milner guest-starred on five episodes of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Life Goes On&quot;.

After retiring from acting, Milner co-hosted a radio show about fishing called &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Hook-Up&quot; on San Diego-area sports station XETRA AM 690 (now XEWW).

In 1998, Milner took part in a documentary film, &quot;Route 66: Return to the Road with Martin Milner&quot;, in which he drove a 1961 Corvette from Chicago to Santa Monica.

==Personal life==
In May 1956, Milner met singer and actress Judith Bess Jones at a Hollywood dinner party. They were married on February 23, 1957, in Waukegan, Illinois. They had four children together.

In February 2003, Milner&#x27;s eldest daughter Amy, who appeared in an episode of &quot;Adam 12&quot;, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. She died in December 2004.

On September 6, 2015, Milner died of heart failure at his home in Carlsbad, California, at age 83. His remains were cremated.

<doc id="710544" wikidata="Q1095348" url="?curid=710544" title="Claremorris">
<text>Claremorris (; ) is a town in County Mayo in the west of Ireland, at the junction of the N17 and the N60 national routes. As of the 2017, it was the fastest growing town in the county, having seen a 31% increase in population between 2006 and 2011 and a 23% increase between 2002 and 2006. Between the 2016 census and the 2022 census, the population of Claremorris grew further, from 3,687 to 3,857 inhabitants.

The town sits at the bottom of a valley, all roads leading to the town follow hills, in particular the old Knock road (known as the Knock hill) and Courthouse road. Although low-lying, the town does not experience flooding. There is no major river through the town although there are two lakes in the town centre: Clare Lough where the &#x27;Land of the Giants&#x27; amenity is located and Mayfield Lough. A small river flows between the two.

==History==

Claremorris derives its name from Maurice de Prendergast, a Norman who came to Ireland .

The town was established during the 18th century. In 1822, a Roman Catholic Chapel was built, which was later demolished to make way for the town hall. The present Roman Catholic church, St. Colman&#x27;s Church, was built in 1911. St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church, now the town library, was built in 1828.

The main landlord family in Claremorris was the Browne family, one of whom, the Hon. Denis Browne (1760–1828), was High Sheriff of Mayo during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and acquired the nickname of &quot;Donnchadha an Rópa&quot; (Denis the Rope) as a result of his treatment of captured United Irishmen.

==Demographics==
At the 2022 census, Claremorris had a total population of 3,857 people, consisting of 1,821 males and 2,036 females. Over 72% of the population were Irish nationals and Catholics constituted 65% of the population.

Genealogical records for Claremorris consist of Roman Catholic church records of marriage which commenced in 1805 and baptisms which commenced in 1825. Church of Ireland records consist of baptisms from 1834 onwards, marriages from 1846 onwards and burials from 1878 onwards. These are held at the South Mayo Family Research Centre in Ballinrobe.

==Amenities==

Retail outlets in the area include the Silverbridge Shopping Centre. Supermarkets in the town include Aldi, Supervalu, Lidl, Centra and Tesco.

There are three hotels including the four-star McWilliam Park Hotel, which opened in 2006. The town also has several restaurants, many pubs and two nightclubs.

A swimming pool and leisure centre opened on 1 September 2009. A Garda Síochána Station opened in 2008.

There are two secondary schools: St. Colman&#x27;s College for boys and Mount St. Michaels for girls. There are also two primary schools, Scoil Mhuire Gan Smál and Claremorris Boys National School. Gaelscoil Uileog de Búrca, in nearby Loughanamon, provides primary education through the Irish language. 

Local events include Claremorris Open Exhibition (an annual arts exhibition in the town held since 1978), and the Claremorris Drama Festival (an annual drama festival held since 1970).

McMahon Park - Clare Lake is located just beside the town. It has tree-lined walks, angling platforms and areas suitable for picnicking. It&#x27;s also home to Land of the Giants, a children&#x27;s attraction.

Claremorris has long been known by locals for its coarse fishing. There are many loughs located around Claremorris where species like Northern Pike, European Perch, European Eel, European Bream and European Roach can be caught regularly. The River Robe located outside the town has been known for its stock of wild brown trout and the Robe&#x27;s tributaries are also hold a stable stock of smaller trout.

==Sports==
There are a number of sporting clubs in the area, including Gaelic games, soccer, rugby and athletics clubs.

Claremorris GAA club has been Mayo senior hurling champions twice (1968 and 1971) and senior county Gaelic football champions four times (1961, 1964, 1965 and 1971).

The local soccer club trains and plays matches at Concannon park. There is also an athletics club which trains on a &quot;Mondo&quot; athletics track. A rugby club, Claremorris Colts RFC, was established in 2009 and meets at the Mount St Michael Convent Girls School pitch. The club was awarded the title of &#x27;Club of the Year&#x27; by the Connacht Branch of the IRFU in April 2012.

A swimming club trains at the Claremorris Leisure Centre, and incorporates water polo. The club was the first from Connacht to win the all-Ireland under 16 &amp; under 19 boys championships, as well as being the first club to win the inaugural girls under-16 and under-19 championships. The Claremorris Leisure Centre opened in 2009 and has a 25-metre, 6 lane, short course competition pool. It also has a gymnasium and fitness studio.

==Transport==

===Road===

Claremorris is situated at a major road junction, and the N17 (Galway-Sligo road) and the N60 (Castlebar-Roscommon road) meet in the town.

The town was once a major traffic bottleneck, with significant traffic jams every afternoon (particularly Fridays), when traffic on the N17 slowly negotiated the old bank corner which consisted of a sharp right hand bend. By the late 1990s, over 13,000 vehicles passed through the town daily. In 1994, a design for the bypass was completed by Mayo County Council. A compulsory purchase order went ahead in 1995, followed by a three-year wait for funding. Construction of the N17 Claremorris bypass commenced in 1998 and it opened in July 2001. Journey times at peak periods were reduced by 30 minutes on the Galway/Sligo route after the opening. The project was built as a grade-separated single carriageway (with motorway style interchanges). The new 16 km road bypassed one of Ireland&#x27;s most treacherous national routes, as the original stretch between Claremorris and Knock had a very high accident.

The busy N60 still passes through the town via an inner relief road. While a second bypass for the town was included in a proposed new N60 road to Castlebar, as of 2011 the National Roads Authority had suspended this development due to cutbacks.

===Railways===

Claremorris railway station, which opened in 1862, is served by the Dublin Galway/Westport line as well as the Ballina Branch Line to Ballina. An additional proposal, under phase 3 of the Western Railway Corridor, proposed to link Claremorris to Athenry via Tuam. However, as of December 2023, no date for this proposed development had been identified, with the &quot;all-island strategic rail review&quot; recommending that related works by &quot;commenced by 2030&quot;.

==Weather station==
Claremorris is home to one of Ireland&#x27;s eight inland weather observing stations, located 2 kilometres from the town centre. It began recording weather in November 1943 and was run and staffed by a local family. During WWII, Ireland provided detailed weather reports to the Allies. Weather reports from Claremorris and Blacksod Lighthouse (located on the west coast of Mayo) played a significant factor in selecting the date of launch for the D-Day landings in June 1944. In 1949, it was decided that the Irish Meteorological Service needed observations on an hourly basis from inland stations like Claremorris. It was decided to staff the station with full-time permanent personnel. In 1996, staff were relocated to Ireland West Airport and it now operates automatically with data uploaded to Dublin.

===Climate===
Claremorris has a temperate oceanic climate with cold winters and warm damp summers. The coldest months being January and February and the wettest being December and October. Claremorris received roughly 1,500 hours of sunshine in 2010. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

<text>Celeste Holm (April 29, 1917 – July 15, 2012) was an American stage, film and television actress.

Holm won an Academy Award for her performance in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), and was nominated for her roles in &quot;Come to the Stable&quot; (1949) and &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950). She also is known for her performances in &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948), &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949), and &quot;High Society&quot; (1956). She is also known for originating the role of Ado Annie in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1943).

==Early life==
Born and raised in Manhattan, Holm was an only child. Her mother, Jean Parke, was an American portrait artist and author. Her father, Theodor Holm, was a Norwegian businessman whose company provided marine adjustment services for Lloyd&#x27;s of London. Because of her parents&#x27; occupations, she traveled often during her youth and attended various schools in the Netherlands, France and the United States. She began high school at the University School for Girls in Chicago, and then transferred to the Francis W. Parker School (Chicago) where she performed in many school stage productions and graduated as a member of the class of 1935. She then studied drama at the University of Chicago before becoming a stage actress in the late 1930s.

==Career==

Holm&#x27;s first professional theatrical role was in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; starring Leslie Howard. She first appeared on Broadway in a small part in &quot;Gloriana&quot; (1938), a comedy which lasted for only five performances, but her first major part on Broadway was in William Saroyan&#x27;s revival of &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1940) as Mary L. with fellow newcomer Gene Kelly. The role that got her the most recognition from critics and audiences was as Ado Annie in the premiere production of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943.

After she starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot;, 20th Century Fox signed Holm to a movie contract in 1946. She made her film debut that same year in &quot;Three Little Girls in Blue&quot;, making a startling entrance in a &quot;Technicolor red&quot; dress singing &quot;Always a Lady,&quot; a belting Ado Annie-type song, although the character was different—a lady. For her role in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), she won an Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. However, after another supporting role in &quot;All About Eve&quot;, Holm realized she preferred live theater to movie work, and only accepted a few select film roles over the next decade. The most successful of these were the comedy &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; (1955) and the musical &quot;High Society&quot; (1956), both of which co-starred Frank Sinatra. She starred as a professor-turned-reporter in New York City in the CBS television series &quot;Honestly, Celeste!&quot; (fall 1954) and was thereafter a panelist on &quot;Who Pays?&quot; (1959). She also appeared ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;.
In 1958, she starred as a reporter in an unsold television pilot called &quot;The Celeste Holm Show&quot;, based on the book &quot;No Facilities for Women&quot;. In 1965, she played the Fairy Godmother alongside Lesley Ann Warren in the CBS production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In 1970–71, she was featured on the NBC sitcom &quot;Nancy&quot;.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Holm did more screen acting, with roles in films such as &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, and in television series (often as a guest star) such as &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. In 1979, she played the role of First Lady Florence Harding in the television mini-series, &quot;Backstairs at the White House&quot;. Holm also starred in the musical &quot;The Utter Glory of Morrissey Hall,&quot; which flopped after a single performance (and seven previews) on Broadway&quot;.&quot; In December 1981 Holm appeared in the lead role in the British premiere of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; at the Nottingham Playhouse. She was a regular on the ABC soap opera &quot;Loving&quot;, appearing first in 1986 in the role of Lydia Woodhouse and again as Isabelle Dwyer Alden #2 from 1991 to 1992. She last appeared on television in the CBS television series &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1996–99).

==Honors==

A life member of The Actors Studio, Holm received numerous honors during her lifetime, including the 1968 Sarah Siddons Award for distinguished achievement in Chicago theatre; she was appointed to the National Arts Council by then-President Ronald Reagan, appointed Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav by King Olav of Norway in 1979, and inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1992. She remained active for social causes as a spokesperson for UNICEF, and for occasional professional engagements. From 1995 she was Chairman of the Board of Arts Horizons, a not-for-profit arts-in-education organization. In 1995, Holm was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame.

In 2006, Holm was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the SunDeis Film Festival at Brandeis University.

Holm was a guest at the 2009 Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Aberdeen, Maryland. Some of the movies in which she appeared were screened at the festival, and the unaired television pilot for &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; was shown. She received an honorary award during the dinner banquet at the close of the event.

==Personal life==
Holm&#x27;s first marriage was at age 19 to Ralph Nelson in 1936. The marriage ended in 1939. Their son is Internet pioneer and sociologist Ted Nelson.

Holm married Francis Emerson Harding Davies, an English auditor, on January 7, 1940. Davies was a Roman Catholic, and she was received into the Roman Catholic Church for the purposes of their 1940 wedding; the marriage was dissolved on May 8, 1945.

From 1946 to 1952, Holm was married to airline public relations executive A. Schuyler Dunning, with whom she had a second son, businessman Daniel Dunning.

In 1961, Holm married actor Wesley Addy. The couple lived together on her family farm in Washington Township, Morris County, New Jersey. He died in 1996.

On April 29, 2004, her 87th birthday, Holm married opera singer Frank Basile, who was 41 years old. The couple had met in October 1999 at a fundraiser for which Basile had been hired to sing. Soon after their marriage, Holm and Basile sued to overturn the irrevocable trust that was created in 2002 by Daniel Dunning, Holm&#x27;s younger son. The trust was ostensibly set up to shelter Holm&#x27;s financial assets from taxes though Basile contended the real purpose of the trust was to keep him away from her money. The lawsuit began a five-year battle, which cost millions of dollars, and according to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, left Holm and her husband with a &quot;fragile hold&quot; on their apartment, which Holm had purchased for $10,000 cash in 1953 from her film earnings, and which in 2011 was believed to be worth at least $10,000,000.

==Health and death==
According to Basile, Holm had been treated for memory loss since 2002, suffered skin cancer, bleeding ulcers and a collapsed lung, and had hip replacements and pacemakers.

In June 2012, Holm was admitted to New York&#x27;s Roosevelt Hospital with dehydration, where she suffered a heart attack on July 13, 2012; she died two days later at her Central Park West apartment, aged 95.

<doc id="710560" wikidata="Q34198" url="?curid=710560" title="Washo language">
<text>Washo (or Washoe; endonym ) is an endangered Native American language isolate spoken by the Washo on the California–Nevada border in the drainages of the Truckee and Carson Rivers, especially around Lake Tahoe. While there were only 20 elderly native speakers of Washo as of 2011, since 1994 there had been a small immersion school that has produced a number of moderately fluent younger speakers. The immersion school has since closed its doors and the language program now operates through the Cultural Resource Department for the Washoe Tribe. The language is still very much endangered; however, there has been a renaissance in the language revitalization movement as many of the students who attended the original immersion school have become teachers.

Ethnographic Washo speakers belonged to the Great Basin culture area and they were the only non-Numic group of that area. The language has borrowed from the neighboring Uto-Aztecan, Maiduan and Miwokan languages and is connected to both the Great Basin and Northern California sprachbunds.

== History ==
In 2012, Lakeview Commons Park in South Lake Tahoe was renamed in the Washo language. &quot;The Washoe Tribe has presented the name (pronounced approx. ) which, in native language, means &quot;all the people&#x27;s place.&quot; It is a name the Tribe would like to gift to El Dorado County and South Lake Tahoe as a symbol of peace, prosperity and goodness.&quot;

==Classification==

Washo is usually considered a language isolate. That is, it shares no demonstrated link with any other language, including its three direct neighboring languages, Northern Paiute (a Numic language of Uto-Aztecan), Maidu (Maiduan), and Sierra Miwok (Utian). It is sometimes classified as a Hokan language, but this language family is not universally accepted among specialists, nor is Washo&#x27;s connection to it.

The language was first described in &quot;A Grammar of the Washo Language&quot; by William H. Jacobsen, Jr., in a University of California, Berkeley, PhD dissertation and this remains the sole complete description of the language. There is no significant dialect variation. (Jacobsen&#x27;s lifelong work with Washo is described at the University of Nevada Oral History Program.)

==Dialects==

Washo shows very little geographic variation. Jacobsen (1986:108) wrote, &quot;When there are two variants of a feature, generally one is found in a more northerly area and the other in a more southerly one, but the lines separating the two areas for the different features do not always coincide.&quot;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are six distinct vowel qualities found in the Washo language, each of which occurs long and short. The sound quality of a vowel is dependent upon their length and the consonant they precede, as well as the stress put on the vowel.

Vowels marked with the acute accent ( ´ ) are pronounced with stress, such as in the Washo (summer).

In Washo, vowels can have either long or short length qualities; the longer quality is noted by appending a colon to the vowel, as in the above example . Vowels with such a mark are usually pronounced for twice the normal length. This can be seen in the difference between the words (shoes) (knee). However, vowels pronounced this way may not always be followed by a colon.

Jacobsen described in detail various vowel alternations that distinguished the Washo speech communities.

===Consonants===
Sequences not represented by a single letter in Washo almost always tend to occur in borrowed English words, such as the &quot;nd&quot; in (&quot;candy&quot;).

In the area around Woodfords, California, the local Washo dialect substituted for , thus, &#x27;bird&#x27; was pronounced &quot;thithu&quot;.

==Morphology==

Washo has a complex tense system.

Washo uses partial or total reduplication of verbs or nouns to indicate repetitive aspect or plural number. Washo uses both prefixation and suffixation on nouns and verbs.

===Verbs===

Verbal inflection is rich with a large number of tenses. Tense is usually carried by a suffix that attaches to the verb. The tense suffix may signal recent past, intermediate past, the long-ago-but-remembered past, the distant past, the intermediate future, or the distant future. For example, the suffix indicates that the verb describes an event that took place in the recent past, usually earlier the previous day as seen in the Washo sentence, (&#x27;the white man fed us&#x27;).

===Nouns===

Possession in Washo is shown by prefixes added to the object. There are two sets of prefixes added: the first set if the object begins with a vowel and the second set if the object begins with a consonant.

<doc id="710604" wikidata="Q2136183" url="?curid=710604" title="Leszynski naming convention">
<text>The Leszynski naming convention (or LNC) is a variant of Hungarian notation popularized by consultant Stan Leszynski specifically for use with Microsoft Access development. Although the naming convention is nowadays often used within the Microsoft Access community, and is the standard in Visual Basic programming, it is not widely used elsewhere.

The conventions are derived from an earlier set of conventions, the Leszynski/Reddick naming conventions, originally developed in 1992 by Greg Reddick. Eventually, Leszynski and Reddick had different ideas about how the conventions should be developed, and split into two separate sets of conventions, the other being the RVBA Conventions.

As in all Hungarian notations, it uses prefixes (called &quot;tags&quot;) to indicate the type of objects and database development fields. The general structure of Hungarian notation (named after Charles Simonyi&#x27;s native country) is to break down object names into the following elements:
[prefix(es)][tag]BaseName[Suffix/Qualifier]
The tags are lower case and the object name is camel case. Spaces and underscores are not used.

==Advantages==
Since the Leszynski naming convention is a special form of Hungarian notation the same general advantages also apply to the Leszynski convention.

The use of distinctive prefixes makes your database self-documenting; when you see &quot;frmSales&quot; in VBA code, you will know that it references a form, and when you see &quot;curSales&quot; you will know that it is a Currency variable. When selecting a query from a drop-down list, you will know that a query starting with &quot;qmak&quot; is a make-table query, while one starting with &quot;quni&quot; is a union query. This information will allow you to avoid errors such as using the SetFocus method (a control method) with a field, or trying to open a table.

==Disadvantages==
*Since the Leszynski naming convention is a special form of Hungarian notation the same general disadvantages also apply to the Leszynski convention.
*Changes in database design may require wholesale renaming. For example, replacing a table with a query would involve either retaining the tbl name for the query, or going through the entire database replacing the tbl name with a query name.
*When transferring the database to a different DBMS, problems will arise if the target DBMS does not support CamelCase names.
*As every object of the same type starts with the same letter, it is not possible to navigate through the objects in a List box by typing the beginning letter.

==Elements==
The elements of the naming convention are described in the following table.

=== The Basic LNC Object Prefixes ===
===The Basic LNC Variable Prefixes===
===The Basic LNC Database Object Tags===
===The LNC Table Field Tags===
===The LNC Tags for VBA Variables===
===The LNC Tags for Form and Report Controls===
===Some Typical LNC Names for Database Objects, Controls and Variables===

<doc id="710609" wikidata="Q943243" url="?curid=710609" title="Joseph Sweeney (actor)">
<text>Joseph Sweeney (July 26, 1884 – November 25, 1963) was an American actor who worked in stage productions, television and movies principally in the 1950s, often playing grandfatherly roles. His best-known role was as the elderly Juror #9 in the 1957 classic &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, the role he originated in a 1954 &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; live teleplay of which the film was an adaptation.

== Early life ==
Born in Philadelphia on 26 July 1884, he was raised in a rooming house in the same place with W. C. Fields. 

==Career==
In 1910 he started on an acting career and moved to Broadway, being fully active on-stage and touring throughout the United States. Sweeney debuted on stage in stock theater with a company in Norwich, Connecticut. 

He had a successful career as a stage performer in such productions as &quot;The Clansmen&quot;, &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;A Slight Case of Murder&quot;, &quot;Dear Old Darlin&quot;, and &quot;Days To Remember&quot;. In the 1940s, he made the switch to television as audiences&#x27; interests changed. He returned to the stage in 1953 to portray Giles Corey in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

In 1949 he was a regular on the CBS series Wesley, and between 1950 and 1960 he appeared in leading and supporting roles and in installments of &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Campbell Television Soundstage&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;, &quot;Playwrights &#x27;56&quot;, &quot;The U.S. Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;.

His most important performance in television was &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; (1954), by Reginald Rose, who played Juror Mr. McCardle, and later repeated the role in Sidney Lumet film adaption alongside Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden. He also played crafty and villainous roles, such as the larcenous former household employee in &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1956) or &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; (1956).

== Death ==
Sweeney continued to act until the time of his death on 25 November 1963 at the age of 79, appearing in numerous television shows and programmes that year alone, including at least in more than a dozen during the last year of his life.

<doc id="710653" wikidata="Q1474490" url="?curid=710653" title="Latvian Russian Union">
<text>The Latvian Russian Union (LRU, , ) (LKS) is a political party in Latvia supported mainly by ethnic Russians and other Russian-speaking minorities. The co-chairpersons of the Latvian Russian Union were Miroslavs Mitrofanovs and Tatjana Ždanoka, both agents of the FSB.

The party, as a Russian proxy, seeks to destabilize Latvian politics by prioritizing the Russian minority in Latvia. It requests the granting of Latvian citizenship to all of Latvia&#x27;s remaining non-citizens and supports Russian and Latgalian as co-official languages in municipalities where at least 20% of the population are native speakers of such a language. It supports stronger ties with Russia and was the only major political organization to oppose Latvia&#x27;s membership in NATO.

==History==
=== As ForHRUL (1998–2014) ===
==== As an electoral alliance (1998–2007) ====
The party originated as the electoral alliance For Human Rights in a United Latvia (ForHRUL) (, PCTVL; , ЗаПЧЕЛ) that was established in May 1998 by three political parties: the National Harmony Party, Equal Rights and the Socialist Party of Latvia, all of which were mainly supported by Russophone voters. The alliance won 16 out of 100 seats in the 1998 parliamentary election and 25 seats in the 2002 parliamentary election, as well as 13 out of 60 seats on Riga City Council in the . After the municipal elections, ForHRUL became part of Riga&#x27;s city government and National Harmony Party member Sergey Dolgopolov became the deputy mayor of Riga City Council.

During this period, ForHRUL&#x27;s most prominent leaders were Jānis Jurkāns, Alfrēds Rubiks and Tatjana Ždanoka. Jurkāns was a leader of the Popular Front of Latvia and founder of the National Harmony Party; Rubiks and Ždanoka were prominent as leaders of the Interfront movement, the Latvian branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the federalist movement in Latvia in the early 1990s. They were fairly popular in the Russian community but very unpopular among ethnic Latvians. ForHRUL therefore remained in opposition, because a coalition with Rubiks or Ždanoka was seen as a political suicide by most other elected parties.

ForHRUL partially broke up in 2003. The National Harmony Party was the first to leave the alliance and the Socialist Party followed half a year later. The remnant of ForHRUL consisted of Equal Rights and . The latter was composed of dissident Socialist Party and National Harmony Party members, like Yakov Pliner, who opposed the decision to quit the alliance. This reduced grouping had only 6 members of the Saeima (out of 25 that the alliance had before the breakup). ForHRUL was the main force supporting the 2003-2005 activities of the Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools.

At the first Latvian election to the European Parliament in 2004, ForHRUL gained one seat, held by Tatjana Ždanoka, who sat with the Greens–European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament. It also proposed the idea of a Europe-wide party of ethnic Russians. ForHRUL supported a federal Europe, with a &quot;common economic and political space from Lisbon to Vladivostok&quot;.

==== As a single party (2007–2014) ====
In 2007, ForHRUL was transformed into a single party that retained the name and identity of the old electoral alliance. In recent years the party&#x27;s support has declined as ethnic Russian voters have switched allegiance to the Harmony party, successor to the National Harmony Party. At the 2010 parliamentary election, the party lost its representation in the Latvian Parliament.

In 2011, the party launched an unsuccessful popular initiative on amending the law governing Latvian nationality. The Central Electoral Commission considered the proposed amendment to be incompatible with the Constitution of Latvia and the process of collecting signatures for a referendum on the proposals was suspended. This decision was eventually upheld by the Constitutional Court of Latvia and the Supreme Court of Latvia. It also supported the 2012 initiative to make Russian a co-official language in Latvia.

=== As Latvian Russian Union (2014–present) ===
In January 2014, ForHRUL changed its name to the Latvian Russian Union. At the 2014 European Parliament election, it retained its single seat in the European Parliament. The party supported the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and has taken a pro-Russian stance in the subsequent Russo-Ukrainian War. In August 2014 the party signed a cooperation agreement with the Crimean branch of Russian Unity to &quot;strengthen the unity of Russian world&quot;.

In July 2018, Ždanoka resigned her mandate in the European Parliament to focus on the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election and was succeeded by Miroslav Mitrofanov. With Andrejs Mamikins as their prime minister candidate Latvian Russian Union gained 3.2% votes, failing to win any seats in Saeima, but qualifying for state funding of almost 20 000 euros a year that the party would not be able to receive since it does not possess an account in a credit institution registered in Latvia as required by the law. In 2020, the party finally succeeded in obtaining an account in a Latvian bank.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, LRU received 6.24% of the votes and gained one seat, held by Tatjana Ždanoka who personally received 18,098 plusses and was crossed out 739 times. In the 2020 Riga City Council election, the party gained 6.5% of the votes and re-entered the Riga City Council with four seats.

On April 8, 2022, the European Free Alliance suspended LRU&#x27;s membership in the party due to &quot;fundamental disagreements&quot; regarding the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, including Ždanoka voting against the European Parliament Resolution condemning it. The same month a 2013 post from the LRU council member Jevgēņijs Osipovs resurfaced and was shared by him and other members of LRU, in which he threatened with &quot;war&quot; if the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders was moved &quot;by even a millimetre&quot;. The monument would be demolished on 25 August 2022.

LRU received a warning from the State Security Service for activities &quot;aimed at justifying violations of foreign policy and international law by Russia, as well as the dissemination of propaganda messages&quot;. The party&#x27;s leadership responded by warning its members &quot;to refrain from speaking, distributing or publishing news that reflects Russia&#x27;s view of this aggressive war, and to avoid publishing news from unsafe sources at all.&quot; The Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau informed LRU that the State Security Service warning could be regarded as grounds for halting state funding to the party.

In the 2022 parliamentary election, the LRU list, which included a number of candidates that represented the populist Centre Party (e.g. ), gathered 3.63% of the vote, which was well below the 5% threshold, but enough for the party to retain state funding. This cooperation was formalized in May 2023, when both parties formed the centre-left (&#x27;Foundation-LV&#x27; or &#x27;Base-LV&#x27;) party alliance in preparation for the 2024 European Parliament election.

In 2024 it was revealed that Ždanoka had been an operative for the FSB since at least 2004.

<doc id="710660" wikidata="Q1070523" url="?curid=710660" title="Cheryl Kernot">
<text>Cheryl Zena Kernot (née Paton, formerly Young; born 5 December 1948) is an Australian politician, academic, and political activist. She was a member of the Australian Senate representing Queensland for the Australian Democrats from 1990 to 1997, and the fifth leader of the Australian Democrats from 1993 to 1997. In 1997, she resigned from the Australian Democrats, joined the Australian Labor Party, and won the seat of Dickson at the 1998 federal election. She was defeated at the 2001 federal election. Kernot was an unsuccessful independent candidate to represent New South Wales in the Australian Senate in the 2010 federal election.

==Early life==
Kernot was born Cheryl Paton in Maitland, New South Wales, on 5 December 1948. She grew up working class and her father worked two jobs to provide for the family. Her maternal grandfather was an organiser for the Australian Labor Party in the Hunter Valley coalfields. She attended East Maitland Primary School and Maitland Girls&#x27; High School.

Kernot received a Commonwealth scholarship to attend the University of Sydney, where she studied government. She received a teaching diploma from the University of Newcastle and spent twelve years as a political activist while working as a school teacher in New South Wales and Queensland. She also worked as an electorate officer and freelance radio producer. In 1984, Kernot was elected Queensland Secretary of the Australian Democrats, and later in the year, Queensland State President, a position she held until 1999. Kernot served as Deputy National President of the party between 1988 until her election to the Senate in 1990.

==Political career==

===Democrats===
Kernot was first elected as a Senator for Queensland at the 1990 election, taking over from the retiring Democrats Senator Michael Macklin.

Kernot surprised party members by immediately contesting the parliamentary deputy leadership, even before taking her place in the Senate on 1 July 1990. In 1991, she controversially acted to discredit and depose the elected leader, Janet Powell, resulting in Powell&#x27;s replacement by John Coulter. Kernot finally achieved her ambition to become the Democrats&#x27; Senate leader after the 1993 election. Meg Lees was elected as her deputy. Inside the party, she spearheaded a drive for central control of the state-based organisations, which resulted in protest resignations of members and the temporary closure of the Western Australian Division. Externally, however, she became a popular media spokesperson, leading the party to one of its best-ever results in the 1996 election and obtaining a primary vote of over 13% for herself.

===Labor Party===
On 15 October 1997, Kernot abruptly moved to the Australian Labor Party, resigning her Senate seat and leaving the leadership of the Democrats to her deputy, Meg Lees, in what was described by journalist Monica Attard as a &quot;defection [that] took the country by storm&quot;. In her resignation speech, Kernot did not criticise the Democrats, saying her motivation was due to a &quot;growing sense of outrage at the damage being done to Australia by the Howard Government&quot; and that her position leading a minor party in the Senate meant she &quot;had a limited capacity to help minimise that damage&quot;. She also stated that she was &quot;well aware of the political risks in this course of action&quot;. Some derided Kernot because of her ambition; and, according to journalist Julia Baird, she &quot;found herself at odds with the leadership of the Labor Party&quot;. Baird went on to say &quot;...[Kernot]...unravelled publicly under the stress, and she was portrayed in print as a has-been, a whinger and a poor performer&quot;. 

Kernot narrowly won the outer metropolitan Brisbane seat of Dickson for Labor at the 1998 election, before losing it at the 2001 election to the Liberal Party candidate Peter Dutton. During her period as Member for Dickson, Kernot served in the Shadow Ministry, and held the roles of Shadow Minister for Regional Development, Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Services from 1998 to 1999, and Shadow Minister for Employment and Training from 1999 to 2001.

==Life outside politics==
After retiring from politics, Kernot wrote an autobiography called &quot;Speaking for Myself&quot;, which was published in 2002. This book was focused on her political career, particularly her move from the Democrats to Labor. On 3 July 2002, in his regular weekly column in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, political journalist Laurie Oakes criticised Kernot for failing to mention an extramarital affair she had with Gareth Evans while she was leader of the Democrats. Evans was deputy leader of the Labor Party and key advocate of her move to Labor. Oakes claimed that the relationship began several years before Kernot joined Labor, and ended in October 1999. He made the claim based on leaked emails in his possession that proved Kernot had a five-year relationship with Evans. Initially, Kernot and Evans made themselves unavailable for comment; however, Evans subsequently confirmed the nature of their relationship.

Kernot worked in the United Kingdom as Programme Director at the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurs at the Said Business School at Oxford University and as the Director of Learning at the School for Social Entrepreneurs in London. Kernot is currently the Director of Social Business at the Centre for Social Impact, based at the University of New South Wales. She has also expressed support for Australia becoming a republic.

==Return to politics==
On 30 July 2010, Kernot announced that she would run as a candidate for the Australian Senate representing New South Wales as an independent on a platform of &quot;Change politics&quot;. She was not successful.

==Other interests==

Kernot was one of Australia&#x27;s first fully qualified female cricket umpires. She was patron of the Australian women&#x27;s cricket team from 1994 to 2000.

Kernot is on the founding committee of a UK charity which works to provide shelter and education for street children in Kampala, Uganda.

In 2014 Kernot became the first patron of the Women in Prison Advocacy Network (WIPAN). WIPAN is a grassroots community charity dedicated to advancing the prospects and wellbeing of women and female youth affected by the criminal justice system. It does so through individual mentoring and advocacy.

<doc id="710662" wikidata="Q1841232" url="?curid=710662" title="Roy Harper (character)">
<text>Roy Harper is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Roy is one of DC&#x27;s most longstanding characters, originating in 1940s comics as [[Speedy (DC Comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of the superheroes Green Arrow and Black Canary. Like his mentor Green Arrow, Roy is a world-class archer and athlete who uses his exceptional marksmanship to fight crime. Along with other prominent DC Comics superhero sidekicks, he goes on to become a core member of the superhero group the Teen Titans. As an adult, Roy casts off his Speedy identity to establish himself as the superhero Arsenal, and later takes on the name Red Arrow to symbolise his coming-of-age and having become an equal of Green Arrow as he joins the Justice League. In addition to continuing to serve on occasion as one of the Titans, Roy has had leading roles in the superhero groups the Seven Soldiers of Victory, the Outsiders, Checkmate, the Justice League, and the Outlaws.

He was the subject of the award-winning 1971 comic book story &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot;, which was celebrated for its gritty depiction of Roy&#x27;s battle with drug addiction; the story is considered a key moment in comic book history as it represented the emergence of mature themes in comics. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Harper as #50 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;. The character has been adapted for video games and animation several times, and was portrayed in live action by Colton Haynes on the Arrowverse television series &quot;Arrow&quot;.

== Publication history ==
The character first appeared as Green Arrow&#x27;s teenage sidekick Speedy, a name by which he was known for over fifty years, in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #73 (November 1941) and was created by Mort Weisinger and George Papp. The character&#x27;s modern-day version was an early member of the Teen Titans who later assumed the identity Arsenal in &quot;The New Titans&quot; #99 (July 1993), and became a member of the Justice League of America under the guise Red Arrow in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; #2 (June 1996) or &quot;Justice League of America&quot; vol. 2 #7 (May 2007).

==Fictional character biography==

===1941–1992: Origin, Teen Titans, addiction and fatherhood===
As an infant, Roy was raised by his father, Roy Harper Sr., a forest ranger. The fate of his birth mother is unknown, something that Roy has questioned his entire life, not sure whether she left them or died. When his father died in a forest fire when Roy was a baby, he was rescued by a man named Brave Bow, a Navajo medicine chief. Brave Bow took Roy into his tribe and raised him as his own son, telling him about how his birth father saved him, which made Roy grow up seeing him as a hero. Under Brave Bow&#x27;s tutelage, Roy trained in archery, becoming remarkable at a very young age and a champion in several events. Roy began learning about the superhero Green Arrow (Oliver Queen) and started idolizing him, seeing him as a hero alongside his father and Brave Bow.

When Brave Bow learned of an illness that would lead to his death, he contacted Green Arrow, asking him to take Roy in and raise him after his death. After posing as a judge in an archery contest, Green Arrow was impressed by Roy&#x27;s skills as an archer, which prompted him to test Roy&#x27;s character by rigging his arrows with magnets so they can be deflected, where Roy proceeded to impress Green Arrow as well. After Brave Bow&#x27;s death, Roy was adopted by Green Arrow and became his sidekick, Speedy. He was given the name Speedy after he stopped a pair of robbers faster than Green Arrow could even put on his costume, and for being quicker than him at shooting arrows and in general.

Speedy became a founding member of the Teen Titans along with Robin, Kid Flash, Aqualad, and Wonder Girl, a group they formed so they as sidekicks could come out of their mentors&#x27; shadows. Roy developed a crush on Wonder Girl Donna Troy, and the two eventually began dating.

As Roy spent more and more time with the Teen Titans, Oliver left to travel the country with Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) after Oliver had lost his fortune. When the Teen Titans had their first break up, Roy found himself alone. Trying to find some comfort, he started taking drugs and developed a heroin addiction in the award-winning &quot;Snowbirds Don&#x27;t Fly&quot; story. When Oliver returned and learned of Roy&#x27;s addiction and behavior, he reacted angrily and banished Roy from his house. When Hal found Roy on the street later, Roy vowed to fight and end his drug addiction. Hal took him to Black Canary, Oliver&#x27;s girlfriend, who helped Roy with his drug withdrawal and gave him care. Roy reconciled with Oliver, but he officially ended their partnership with him, going fully solo.

When the Teen Titans formed again, Roy rejoined the team. He created a band, Great Frog, with fellow Titan Mal Duncan. Roy also managed the Titans&#x27; base of operations under the nightclub Gabriel&#x27;s Horn, where his band played frequently.

After he went solo, Roy started working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), working as a counselor in various anti-drug programs as well as in helping taking down drug operations and drug lords. His work with the DEA led to him joining the Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI), a fictional federal agency in the DC Universe, where he worked as an agent and spy. While on undercover assignment with the CBI in Japan, Roy was supposed to capture the assassin Cheshire, but they fell in love and had a relationship. His feelings for her made him turn a blind eye and let her go free.

About a year later, Roy met Cheshire again on a mission with the Titans, where he found out he fathered a daughter with her, Lian. Cheshire, however, only allowed Roy to see her once. Desperate to see Lian again on her first birthday, Roy sought the help of his best friend, Dick Grayson, now going by Nightwing. The two of them found Lian and fought off Cheshire, where Dick helped him find Lian and give her to him. It was here that Cheshire realized how much more dangerous her life as an assassin was, and she decided to give Roy full custody of Lian.

As he sought a calmer place to learn how to raise Lian, Roy left the CBI and briefly moved to Northern Ireland, where his birth ancestors came from. Despite his attempt to avoid his work as a superhero there, he found that he could not avoid it as he found himself in the middle of a mystery. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he took up work as a private detective, balancing that job with being Speedy and raising his daughter. It was during this time that Roy also fully reunited with Oliver after some time of not being on full speaking terms, where he was finally prepared to forgive him and accept him as a father.

===1993–1996: Becoming Arsenal and leading the Titans===

Roy decided to take up spy work again, and he was reassigned to Checkmate, under the command of Sarge Steel. While at Checkmate, Roy expanded his skills beyond just using a bow and arrow and became a weapons expert, as well as mastering Moo Gi Gong, the martial art of using any household or random item as a weapon. This was when he stopped being Speedy to focus on his work as Agent Harper full-time. At Checkmate, Roy became friends with a fellow agent, Martin Santos and his wife Erika and their family, who helped him with Lian in her early years.

Being a founding member and current reserve member of the Titans, Roy was sent by Checkmate to talk to Dick about the Titans, who had recently been under pressure from the government and the media due to the large amount of damage caused in the battle against the Wildebeests in the Titans Hunt storyline. Roy was asked to convince Dick into having the Titans cooperate with the government, he had also secretly heard that if the Titans did not cooperate, Congress would work on shutting down all superhero teams, so he tried to levy the situation as much as he could, but he knew it would not work out.

Roy suggested a compromise to Sarge Steel: that he would return to the Titans full-time and make sure everything was going smooth himself. Since he had not been Speedy for some time, Roy decided to take on a new mantle. With some help and technology acquired from Steve Dayton (whose mansion the Titans have been using as an HQ), Roy built new gear and a new costume, now officially calling himself Arsenal.

Some time later, the wedding of Dick and Starfire was interrupted by an attack, causing the death of the minister and damage all around. This caused a major uproar from the government and media against the Titans. Because of what happened at the wedding, Sarge Steel turned on the deal he made with Roy, demanding that he take leadership of the Titans himself, or else the government will shut them down. Roy refused to do it, not wanting to turn on Dick because he knew he had faith in him as a leader and man, confident that he would turn it around, but he kept receiving further pressure from Steel. The situation was only made worse when the attorney general announced he was planning on prosecuting the Titans and all non-sanctioned superhero teams. When he heard about that, Roy turned to Donna, Wally, Garth, and the rest of the Titans for advice on what he should do. Deciding that the situation was bad and had to be handled, they agreed to ask Dick to temporarily resign leadership until this thing blew over, especially since they agreed that he needed a break from all the pressure he&#x27;d been receiving himself recently after the wedding incident.

Roy, along with Donna, Garth, Red Star, and Pantha, went over to talk to Dick about it. After some arguing and a brief fight, Dick realized that he wasn&#x27;t in any place to lead right now and agreed to hand over leadership, and take a leave of absence from the team as well, realizing that was what was best for him at the time because of everything that had happened recently. That was when Roy, with his new superhero identity as Arsenal, took over as leader of the Titans, much to his own dismay.

As leader, Roy was faced with constant pressure from the government. Eventually, with help from Wally and Garth, Roy managed to turn the situation on the government and take away anything they had on the Titans, making it so they operated on their own terms. As leader of the Titans, Roy brought on new members to the team including and established a satellite base in addition to the Earth base. Once he dealt with the government, Roy led the Titans on several cosmic missions. He planned to evolve the team beyond just traditional superhero business, wanting to expand the ways they could help. Eventually, he and Donna disbanded the team, when he realized it was not functioning as a family like the Titans should.

When Checkmate drugged Roy and unsuccessful tried manipulating him into killing someone, Roy severed all ties with them and Sarge Steel, going back to being a regular superhero.

===1996–2003: Titans reunion===

After the death of Oliver Queen, Roy moved to Metropolis. During a reunion with Dick, Wally, and Garth, Roy faced the villain Haze, who made Roy face an image of his ideal self, which was him in a red version of the Green Arrow suit. To honor Ollie after his recent death, Roy embraced this and took on the red Green Arrow suit fully and went back to using a bow as his primary weapon. He joined the new Teen Titans team, acting as an experienced mentor to the younger new heroes along with fellow first generation Titan Lilith Clay.

While in Metropolis, Roy and Lian were also sought out by Vandal Savage. Savage had discovered that both Roy and his daughter Lian were his descendants. Thus, their organs were suitable for him to harvest to prolong his life. Roy was able to save his daughter from Savage. Roy then got a band tattoo on his left bicep, to honor to his Navajo heritage.

Shortly after, Roy joined the rest of the original five Titans (now known as Nightwing, Arsenal, Troia, The Flash, and Tempest) in reforming the Titans team for a new generation. He resided in Titans Tower, with his daughter Lian. Roy took on a mentorship role to Grant Emerson, the younger hero known as Damage, who Roy recruited in his tenure as leader. He became a father figure to him, seeing a younger version of himself in Grant. It was also during this time that Roy found out he had a living relative in the form of Jim Harper, the clone of his great uncle.

===2004–2006: Death of Donna Troy and reforming the Outsiders===

A mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and Young Justice after summoning them to San Francisco. Before any decisions could be made, a cybernetic girl from the future known as Indigo invaded the complex, and immediately engaged both teams in combat. With half the group out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue Superman android, which had been activated. Caught by surprise, Lilith had her neck snapped by the Superman android, killing her instantly. Donna Troy tried valiantly to defeat the Superman android, but he released a deadly heat beam directly through her chest, killing her. Roy, with help from Tim Drake, managed to reprogram Indigo, who arrived and shut down the Superman android, leaving Arsenal and Nightwing to mourn the fallen Troia. Shaken by these losses, Nightwing decided to officially end the Titans as he did not want to put the people he loved in the face of danger anymore, despite Roy&#x27;s protests against this decision, saying they had to honor what the five of them started.

Mourning Donna&#x27;s death, Roy shaved off his hair and donned a new, more advanced suit and got to work assembling a new team of heroes called the Outsiders, this time full of strangers instead of loved ones, in an effort to convince Dick to rethink his decision. Roy began by buying a massive secret underground headquarters beneath New York City. Roy outfitted the shelter with state-of-the-art equipment and began recruiting members for the new team.

Dick and Roy co-lead this new iteration of Outsiders that consisted of Thunder, Grace Choi, Shift, Jade, and Indigo, with the aim to try to take the lead on crime and take it down before it happens.

During a mission, Roy was shot five times in the chest, leaving him out of commission for three months. When he was ready to get back, despite his skills being just as good as they were before, he found it hard settle back in because of his PTSD and fear of his own limitations, finding that he was afraid of being shot again and what that might do to Lian if he were hurt in a worse way. With the help and encouragement of Nightwing, Roy found it in himself to believe in his abilities once more, and to get back out there and face his fears.

Not long after his recovery, the Outsiders took on a case which involved a child-slaver and molester named Tanner. One of Tanner&#x27;s informants recognized Roy from years prior, and led Tanner to Lian. Lian&#x27;s nanny was killed and the girl was branded with Tanner&#x27;s mark. The Outsiders arrived just in time to save Lian and other children from being flown out of New York.

Roy&#x27;s near-death experience from gunshot wounds saved his life when he faced Deathstroke. Since the Outsiders began, Roy had been collecting intel from Batman, but he found out that it was not actually Batman, it was Deathstroke posing as him. Deathstroke and Arsenal fought, with Deathstroke intending to kill him, but when the mercenary discovered the bullet scars on Arsenal&#x27;s chest, he figured Arsenal had suffered enough and gave him a &quot;pass&quot;, as a sign of respect for the history between the two with the Titans as well. About the same time, Arsenal was also kidnapped by Constantine Drakon, Green Arrow&#x27;s nemesis. Drakon was working with the Riddler, and slit Roy&#x27;s throat so that he would have to apply constant pressure or die. The Outsiders helped search for and rescue Roy.

When Indigo was corrupted by Lex Luthor and exploded, killing herself in the process and almost killing the Outsiders and Teen Titans, Dick left the team, leaving Roy to assume full leadership of the team.

After the return of Donna Troy, Roy began to rethink his position as an Outsider. While leading an effort to take down the Secret Society, Roy realized that working like this was too much for him, and that operating from the shadows wasn&#x27;t for him, and that he wasn&#x27;t meant to blur the line. When Lian told him that she saw him up at night, looking sad, Roy finally made the decision to leave the Outsiders, accepting that he wasn&#x27;t made for the life of a cloak-and-dagger type hero. He handed leadership of the team officially back to Dick and took his leave, seeking to be a hero more in the light, aspiring to be more of a hero that can be an inspiration to people and to Lian.

===2005–2011: Becoming Red Arrow and joining the Justice League===

For the next year, Roy worked solo for the most part. During a team up with Dinah Lance and Hal Jordan to help Red Tornado, Roy found himself fighting Amazo alongside several other heroes. After this, he was invited to join the Justice League, where he officially took on the name Red Arrow, wanting to honor his family name and legacy, seeing this name as a final coming-of-age for him to become the hero he was always meant to be.

While on the league, Roy developed a romantic relationship with Hawkgirl.

As Red Arrow, Roy found himself to be fully settled for the first time in a while, happy that he was fully embracing his legacy. He bought a house in Star City, to give Lian more room as she grew up, and even began giving her archery lessons, realizing that one day, she would probably want to take on the family legacy herself.

Roy was also part of the Titans as they reformed once again.

During a fight with Prometheus, Roy&#x27;s right arm was severed, and he was rendered comatose. Prometheus unleashed an earthquake on Star City that resulted in the death of Lian as well. When Roy woke up, he was devastated, separating himself from everyone as he grew an addiction to pain medications, before falling into a new drug, which caused him to hallucinate ghosts. Roy also received a new cybernetic arm developed by his friend Cyborg. Dealing with his grief, Roy joined Cheshire in Deathstroke&#x27;s new rogue Titans team, in a secret plan to take out Deathstroke from the inside. However, unbeknownst to him, Slade was drugging Roy to control him. When the drug wore off and Roy came back to his senses, he fought Deathstroke out and vowed to redeem himself in Lian&#x27;s honor by redeeming the Titans name that Slade diminished, deeming it something worth fighting for, as well as making amends with everyone he loved. He decided to start and lead a new Titans team that would redeem the name, and he was joining the recently resurrected Jericho (Joey Wilson), his friend and fellow Titan.

During the &quot;Convergence&quot; storyline, Roy is living in Gotham, where he started a children&#x27;s home and shelter, Lian&#x27;s Place. The villain Dreamslayer offered Roy a deal: that he would return Lian if Roy betrayed his friends Donna Troy and Starfire. Roy outsmarted him and managed to get Lian back without harming anyone, revealing that he had weaponized Gotham in case something like this ever happened. With that, Lian was back to life and Roy was reunited with his daughter once more.

===2011–2016: The New 52===

In DC&#x27;s New 52 reboot Roy&#x27;s backstory becomes more developed: his mother is no longer an unknown, but a forest ranger with his father, who die together in the forest fire. He is adopted into a Spokane tribe in Seattle (instead of a Navajo tribe in Arizona) by Big Bow (previously named Brave Bow) gaining an adoptive brother, Bird. Big Bow was killed in mysterious circumstances, and for several years Roy believed he was the culprit, as during that time he was so heavily intoxicated his memories were unclear or forgotten. Years later, he would discover Big Bow was killed by a corrupt sheriff, who Roy then brought to justice with help from Oliver Queen.

Roy&#x27;s relationship with Oliver is only slightly changed in the reboot, with the story of their separation remaining similar and the main change appearing in their reunion which takes far longer.

In the New 52, Roy&#x27;s addiction was retconned into an alcohol addiction, before being retconned back again into a heroin addiction. After he falls out with Oliver and loses his shares in Q-core he seeks out street fights and violence as a part of a downward spiral. He ends up fighting Killer Croc and tries to provoke Croc into killing him. Jones recognises Roy&#x27;s suicidal behaviour and demands Roy &quot;get[s] on with his life&quot; and that he will not do his &#x27;dirty work&#x27; for him. An unlikely friendship develops between the two, with Jones seeing his own past as an addict in Roy and becoming Roy&#x27;s sponsor as a result.

After Roy becomes sober, he joins The Outlaws, where he becomes closer with Jason Todd and develops a romantic relationship with Starfire ( Koriand&#x27;r). At the end of this arc, Koriand&#x27;r returns to her home planet to ensure the safety of her sister, with Roy walking away into the jungle. After this, Roy teams up with Jason (Red Hood) again, in &quot;Red Hood/Arsenal&quot;.

During the &quot;Titans Hunt&quot; storyline, Roy, along with several other heroes, found out he was part of the original Teen Titans, with all of their memories being forgotten due to unknown circumstances. When they discovered their memories were erased as a way to defeat the villain Mister Twister, they defeated him once more in the present. This led to the team being reformed, with the team regaining their memories of each other&#x27;s relationships. Roy&#x27;s romance with Donna Troy was rekindled during this time, as the two remembered the years they spent together.

===2016–2020: DC Rebirth===
As part of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Roy appeared as a main character in the Titans book, where he and the rest of the Titans were reunited with their best friend Wally West after he reappeared in the timeline. When Lilith encountered an anomaly in the multiverse, the Titans moved to Manhattan to investigate, where they set up Titans Tower once. The Titans took on various villains such as Abra Kadabra and the Fearsome Five, and Roy led them to take out a drug operation for a new drug known as Bliss.

Roy also redeveloped his romantic relationship with Donna Troy here, with the two admitting their shared feelings to one another.

Roy also fully reunited with Oliver in the &quot;Green Arrow&quot; title, where the two helped the protestors at Roy&#x27;s tribe fight against a militia known as the Wild Dogs.

During the &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot; storyline, Roy, alongside Wally West and various other heroes, is killed in a Speed Force explosion caused by Savitar. He is later resurrected by Batman using a Black Lantern ring in &quot;Dark Nights: Death Metal&quot;.

===2021–2022: Infinite Frontier===
Following his resurrection, Roy is believed dead by the public, but is known to the Department of Extranormal Operations. He is the subject of one of several reports prepared by Cameron Chase for Director Bones. The report establishes that some aspects of Roy&#x27;s pre-&quot;&quot; history have been restored to continuity, most notably the birth and apparent death of Lian Harper. Chase speculates about how Roy is handling his restored traumatic memories and whether he can be an asset or hindrance to the DEO.

At a bar in New Mexico, Roy deliberately antagonizes a man named Bill into a &quot;fight&quot;. Roy allows Bill to repeatedly beat him and refuses to fight back, it is implied that he is once again attempting suicide. The bartender, who resembles Lian, steps in to defend him and Bill threatens her. Newly energized by his desire to protect her, Roy easily defeats Bill and steals his motorcycle, riding off into the night.

It is revealed in &quot;DC Festival of Heroes: The Asian Superhero Celebration&quot; that teenage vigilante and Catwoman supporting character Cheshire Cat is Lian Harper, alive and apparently suffering from amnesia.

After stopping an argument at a diner, the building came under attack by soldiers led by X-Tract (Cameron Chase of Earth-2) seeking to capture Roy only for a beam of dark energy to blast them away. Roy would realise that he now wields a Black Lantern ring. Deciding to use it on practice, the ring then showed a construct of his now teenage daughter Lian. Realising that she is alive. Roy demanded the ring to find her, but in doing so, using the ring with such force nearly rendered Roy in a zombie-like state with an Omega symbol on his chest, revealing the ring was controlled by Darkseid. Roy ended up in space where he was captured by Hector Hammond who was working alongside X-Tract to take him to Earth-Omega. Roy ended up defeating Hammond and his army and was nearly in Darkseid&#x27;s control until the missing members of the JSA led by Jade showed up for help. Upon arriving in Earth-Omega, they encountered Director Bones and Psycho-Pirate who also became agents of Darkseid to bring heroes to Earth-Omega in exchange for sparing Earth-0. Roy fought Psycho-Pirate which end up with the ring taken full control of him and brought Darkseid to Earth-Omega and claim Roy as his slave only to be saved by Jade and Obsidian helping him to break free from the ring&#x27;s control. Once President Superman managed to open the cracks of the multiverse, the source of the ring&#x27;s power became depleted allowing Roy to free from it completely. After Darkseid and Bones were defeated, Roy and the rest of the heroes returned to their reality.

Decided to reunite with the rest of the Titans, Roy returned to the Titans Tower where it became an academy for young superheroes and was named after him. After a surprising and joyful reunion with his old teammates, Roy discussed his return and mentioned that Lian is still alive, with the Titans promising they&#x27;ll find her.

During &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;, the academy was attacked and destroyed by Deathstroke and his army of supervillains. Roy and the rest of the Titans, led by Nightwing, rallied up Earth&#x27;s heroes to try and stop the villains and Pariah&#x27;s dark army until the Justice League, who Pariah banished to different realities, returned to Earth-0 to win the battle.

===2023–present: Dawn of DC===

Reunited with Dinah and Connor, the three began searching for Green Arrow, who became lost in the timestream during the League’s battle with the Dark Army. Along the way, Roy discovered that Lian is operating as the vigilante Cheshire Cat in Gotham City. After arriving in Gotham, Roy and Lian briefly reunite only for her and Connor to be teleported to different timezones. Discovering that Amanda Waller was behind it, Roy and Dinah tracked Peacemaker demanded to know where Waller is, which Peacemaker refused to discuss. With no other option, Roy contacted Jade to help them find Lian, Connor and Oliver. After separating with Dinah, Roy and Jade tracked down one of Waller&#x27;s safehouses but both were shot down and seemingly killed by Waller herself.

==Powers and abilities==
In the comic books, Roy Harper possesses no superhuman attributes, but he is extremely adept at the use of the bow and arrow, as well as a wide array of weaponry, with Green Arrow admitting that Roy surpassed him. He also has the ability to take virtually any object and use it in combat as an effective weapon, a martial art he mastered known as Moo Gi Gong, which itself is a branch of Hwa Rang Do. Roy&#x27;s Moo Gi Gong training included the mastery of 108 different classical weapon classes, which makes him a master weapon wielder with any weapon type (including, but not limited to, knives, swords, ropes, sais, blades, and staffs) and able to turn any random object into a deadly weapon. In addition, Roy&#x27;s natural marksmanship and archery training from growing up gives him an impeccable aim that gives him perfect aim with any long range or projectile weapons. Harper is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and he possesses keen analytical and detective skills. He was trained in hand-to-hand fighting by several characters, including Black Canary and Nightwing. He was also taught how to box by Hal Jordan. Roy is a master of espionage because of his spy days at the CBI and Checkmate. Roy can also use acupressure as a means of temporarily disabling an opponent&#x27;s muscles by hitting them at very specific points in their bodies, something that comes in handy with his precise aim.

Roy speaks Japanese and understands Russian. Before Flashpoint, after the loss of his right arm, Roy Harper received an advanced prosthetic, built by Vic Stone, designed to loop around his damaged nerve endings and restore his usual degree of hand-to-eye coordination, albeit with the price of a constant phantom limb pain. The pain was eliminated in the second version of the arm.

===Weapons and equipment===
Before Flashpoint, much like Nightwing and other members of the Bat-Family, Roy Harper&#x27;s suit is capable of emitting an electronic pulse. It is unknown, however, whether or not his suit is capable of emitting only one pulse, like Batman&#x27;s and Nightwing&#x27;s, or several. Roy carries various weapons in his many suits, including a bow and several arrows, including many utility and trick arrows. He has been known to carry around a crossbow, throwing knives, a staff, laser heat sidearms, billy clubs, a boomerang, an electrified bolas amongst a wide array of non-lethal weapons.

Roy also embeds Promethium Kevlar to armor his suits, which has saved his life on at least two occasions.

== Personal life ==

Roy Harper is, by adoption, of Navajo heritage, and has a tribal band tattoo on his left bicep to represent it. He has had three father figures in his life: his biological father, Roy Harper Sr., who Roy sees as a hero after his death saving people in a forest fire, his adoptive father Brave Bow, who took Roy in and raised him like a son, and his second adoptive father, Oliver Queen (Green Arrow), who took Roy in after Brave Bow&#x27;s death and made his ward and sidekick. Before becoming Speedy, Roy was a champion athlete, most notably in archery, but also in track and field.

Roy has a daughter named Lian whom he raised as a single father for years. Roy is a natural thrill seeker, who has many connections in the government and metahuman community. He has had several jobs, including being a drummer in his own band, running a nightclub, being a Private Detective, working as an agent and spy for the CBI, counseling in various anti-drug programs, and running a shelter for lost families.

Roy also sees Black Canary as a mother, since she took him in and helped him get through his withdrawal, and she was also one of his teachers in his training as a hero. He was there for her when she lost her own mother, and he has always had a close relationship with her.

Additionally, he sees Hal Jordan as an uncle figure, as he was always around when Roy was younger, being the best friend of Oliver. Roy cites that Hal was the one who taught Roy to be unafraid, and Hal has said that he sees himself in Roy, and could see him as his successor one day. Roy has also stated he sees Connor Hawke as a brother, with the two of them being Oliver&#x27;s children, and growing to see each other as brothers despite the differences in how they turned out, but finding something in common in the fact that they both want to honor Oliver and Green Arrow&#x27;s legacy. Roy also has a sibling relationship with the second Speedy, Mia Dearden. While he was against her being Speedy at first, he quickly changed his mind when he realized what it meant to her when she told him she wanted to take it on to honor him and his use of the Speedy mantle to fight through his addiction and change his life for the better by growing as a person and hero through putting a positive output to the world, and how that inspired her to take it up after her recent positive HIV diagnosis. Roy began taking on a bit of the mentor relationship to Mia, and handed down a various array of some of his old arrows and things he used as Speedy.

Roy also participates in a lot of volunteer work. In addition to counseling for anti-drugs and running a shelter for lost families, he also regularly volunteers at soup kitchens, especially around the holidays, and competes in various archery charity events in his superhero identities to raise money for charities.

Roy&#x27;s most well known relationship throughout his history with the assassin Cheshire. After falling in love with her on a mission where he was sent to capture her, she became the mother of his child, a daughter called Lian. Roy and Jade had a relationship that was rekindled several times throughout the years, with both of them wanting to be there for their daughter and their love for each other, despite constantly being pulled away due to their different loyalties. Roy makes an effort to keep Jade part of Lian&#x27;s life, despite her crimes and always being on the run. His feelings for Jade always made him see past her crimes, and he&#x27;s even considered abandoning everything and running away with her and Lian.

Roy&#x27;s first known superhero relationship was with Donna Troy during the Teen Titans. Although short-lived, the pair had rekindled their relationship on multiple occasions over the years, particularly during their time with the reformed Titans. When he formed the Outsiders, he had a fling with Grace Choi, although they mutually saw each other as friends-with-benefits. At this time, he also had a fling with the Huntress. During his time as a member of the Justice League, he was attracted to his JLA teammate Hawkgirl and they would later began a romantic relationship, but was eventually strained because of Hawkgirl&#x27;s past relationship with Hawkman which caused Roy to feel she didn&#x27;t take their relationship as seriously as he did.

<doc id="710667" wikidata="Q183158" url="?curid=710667" title="Nova (rocket)">
<text>Nova was a series of NASA&#x27;s rocket designs that were proposed both before and after the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program. Nova was NASA&#x27;s first large launcher proposed in 1958, for missions similar to what Saturn V was subsequently used for. The Nova and Saturn V designs closely mirrored each other in basic concept, power, size, and function. Differences were minor but practical, and the Saturn was ultimately selected for the Apollo program, largely because it would reuse existing facilities to a greater extent and could make it to the pad somewhat earlier.

During a series of post-Apollo studies in the late 1960s, considerations for a crewed mission to Mars revealed the need for boosters much larger than Apollo&#x27;s, and a new series of designs with as many as eight Rocketdyne F-1 engines were developed under the Nova name (along with the Saturn MLV). The image of the Nova C8 is commonly used as a representative of the entire Nova series, and many references to Nova refer specifically to these post-Apollo versions. The two series of designs were, essentially, separate, but shared their name. Thus, &quot;Nova&quot; does not refer to a specific rocket design, just a rocket larger than the Saturn V in most cases. Nova was the name used by NASA in the early 1960s for a super booster in the 10 to 20 million pound thrust range.

==Lunar rockets==
The first Nova series was designed in-house at NASA in 1958. This project examined several designs, the smallest having four F-1s in the lower stage and J-2s in the uppers. This design placed 24 tons in a lunar injection trajectory. These designs were presented to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 27, 1959.

The Nova designs were not the only lunar rockets being considered at the time. The U.S. Air Force was in the process of defining its Lunex Project, including a massive booster design using a cluster of solid fuel rockets in the lower stage with liquid hydrogen-powered uppers mounting the J-2 or M-1. Meanwhile, at the US Army&#x27;s Redstone Arsenal, Wernher von Braun was developing his &quot;Juno V&quot; design, using a cluster of Jupiter and Redstone related engines and tanks for a lower stage, a Titan I missile as the second stage.

In 1959 the Army decided it was no longer interested in developing large boosters, for which it had no immediate need, and it passed von Braun&#x27;s team over to NASA. This left NASA with two large booster designs: its own Nova, and von Braun&#x27;s recently renamed Saturn (&quot;the one after Jupiter&quot;). Over the next two years the competing NASA and Air Force studies continued, but immediately following President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s call to reach the Moon before the end of the decade, NASA was given the mission and work on Lunex ended.

Originally, NASA had designed Nova for the &quot;direct ascent&quot; mission profile, in which a single large spacecraft would be placed in Earth orbit, and after transferring to a lunar orbit, would land directly on the Moon and take off without the need for rendezvous and docking with multiple spacecraft, which was as yet untried and perceived to be difficult. This greatly increased the liftoff mass of the space vehicle.

Von Braun favored a profile that built up the spacecraft in Earth orbit, which reduced the launch mass needed for any one launch. However, as studies into the spacecraft needed for the mission started, it became clear that the systems would be much heavier than initially suspected; the existing Nova designs were too small, and the original Saturn design would need up to fifteen launches to put all the parts and fuel into orbit. A redesign of both plans followed.

Nova was still targeting the direct ascent approach, which required the most lift capacity. The most powerful of the resulting &quot;normal&quot; designs, the 8L, included eight F-1&#x27;s in the lower stage and placed 68 tons in a translunar trajectory. Other designs in the series replaced the F-1s with large solids, while others studied nuclear rocket engines for the upper stages. Lunar payload for the various models varied between 48 and 75 tons.

A number of upgraded Saturns were also studied. Dr. von Braun&#x27;s original Saturn design became the A-1 model, while the A-2 replaced the Titan missile with a Jupiter. The more powerful B-1 model used a cluster of Titans for its second stage, but was otherwise similar to the A-1. More &quot;radical&quot; proposals, those requiring new engines, were lumped together in the &quot;C series&quot;. C-1 was similar to the A-1, but used new upper stages derived from Titan engines, while the similar C-2 used new J-2 powered upper stages. C-3 through C-5 used the same J-2 powered uppers, but added a new first stage powered by three, four, or five F-1 engines (hence the names). Dr. von Braun&#x27;s favored approach remained Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR), but this time based on two Saturn C-3&#x27;s.

The debate between the various approaches came to a head in 1961, and the outcome was unexpected by both teams. Instead of either the direct ascent or Earth orbit rendezvous, the working group instead selected a third option, Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR). LOR had a mass requirement about midway between the Saturn C-3 and Nova 8L. After studying what would be required to modify either booster to the new requirement of about in low Earth orbit (LEO), it seemed that the Saturn C-5 would be the best solution. The C-2 model would also be built as a testbed system, launching subassemblies into orbit for flight testing before the C-5 would be ready. The main determinant in selecting the Saturn over the Nova was that the Saturn C-5 could be built in an existing factory outside New Orleans, later known as the Michoud Assembly Facility, while the larger diameter Nova would need new factories to be built.

Studies on the Nova series continued into 1962 as a backup for Saturn, but were eventually ended as the Saturn-based LOR profile became ingrained.

==Mars rockets==
As the Apollo program continued, NASA designers started looking at their needs for the post-Apollo era, and it appeared that a human mission to Mars would be the next &quot;obvious&quot; step. For this role the Saturn V was far too small, and a second series of Nova design studies started for launchers of up to planned for 1977 delivered to LEO. Unlike the original Nova series which was designed by NASA, the new designs were studied under contract by the major aerospace companies that did &quot;not&quot; receive major Apollo-related contracts, namely General Dynamics and Martin Marietta. Philip Bono at Douglas Aircraft decided to send in his own unsolicited proposals as well.

All of the companies submitted a wide variety of designs. Many of these were based on existing technology, suitably enlarged. For instance, Martin&#x27;s smallest design, the 1B, used fourteen F-1s in the first stage and had a LEO payload of . They also suggested a number of &quot;advanced&quot; designs using the latest (undeveloped) technology, notably aerospike engines. The Nova C8 concept was nearly identical to the proposed &quot;Saturn C-8&quot;; there were differences in staging engines and in the stage-1 fin/flaring arrangement.

Soon after the proposals were submitted, it became clear that post-Apollo funding would be considerably less. NASA abandoned its Nova plans in 1964.

<doc id="710680" wikidata="Q602020" url="?curid=710680" title="2007 Ontario general election">
<text>The 2007 Ontario general election was held on October 10, 2007, to elect members (MPPs) of the 39th Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, Canada. The Liberals under Premier Dalton McGuinty won the election with a majority government, winning 71 out of a possible 107 seats with 42.2% of the popular vote. The election saw the third-lowest voter turnout in Ontario provincial elections, setting a then record for the lowest voter turnout with 52.8% of people who were eligible voted. This broke the previous record of 54.7% in the 1923 election, but would end up being surpassed in the 2011 and 2022 elections.

As a result of legislation passed by the Legislature in 2004, election dates are now fixed by formula so that an election is held approximately four years after the previous election, unless the government is defeated by a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in the Legislature. Previously, the governing party had considerable flexibility to determine the date of an election anywhere up to five years of being elected. The date of this election was originally presumed to be October 4, 2007; however, the law fixes the date on the first Thursday of October or on any day within seven days thereof if required to accommodate a date of &quot;religious or cultural significance&quot;. The date was set as October 10, 2007, to avoid a conflict with the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret, which fell on October 4, 2007.

In the same election, there was a provincial referendum on whether to change from first-past-the-post to mixed member proportional representation, as recommended by the Ontario Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform. This measure failed, with 37% of the participating electorate and 5 out of 107 ridings voting for the new system; a 60% supermajority was required province-wide, with at least 2/3 of the ridings also supporting it by a simple majority.

==Issues==
Although all four parties released a variety of detailed platform proposals, the campaign was dominated almost entirely by John Tory&#x27;s promise to extend public funding to Ontario&#x27;s faith-based schools.

In Ontario at present, the Catholic school system is fully funded in the same manner as public schools. However, other religious schools, such as Jewish, Muslim or Christian schools, are not funded by the province. This discrepancy has been cited as discriminatory by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the United Nations Human Rights Committee, although to date the province has taken no action to change its existing school funding policies, on the grounds that Catholic school funding in the province is mandated by the Constitution of Canada.

Tory&#x27;s proposal to extend funding to religious schools was controversial, with polls confirming that a clear majority of Ontarians opposed the proposal. Even some of Tory&#x27;s own caucus, most notably Bill Murdoch and Garfield Dunlop, openly criticized the proposal during the election campaign. After heavy opposition, Tory changed his position later in the campaign, promising a free vote on the issue.

The Liberals and the NDP were both opposed to non-Catholic religious school funding, while the Green Party proposed eliminating the province&#x27;s existing Catholic school funding in favour of a single public school board. Liberal opposition to non-Catholic religious school funding, especially private Muslim schools, appealed to Islamophobic sentiment in the province.

There was a brief flurry of interest in health care issues when John Tory emphasized his support for an increasing role for the private sector in health care.

In the final week of the campaign, NDP leader Howard Hampton criticized the media for focusing almost entirely on religious schools and virtually ignoring other issues.

==Redistribution==
With the passing of Bill 214 and the &quot;Representation Act, 2005&quot; in the year 2005, Ontario&#x27;s electoral boundaries were no longer identical to the federal electoral boundaries. The province was now divided into 11 northern electoral districts that were identical, except for a minor boundary adjustment, to the ones that existed on October 2, 2003, and 96 southern electoral districts that were identical to their federal counterparts as they existed on September 1, 2004.

The 11 northern electoral districts were: Algoma—Manitoulin, Kenora—Rainy River, Nickel Belt, Nipissing, Parry Sound—Muskoka, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Thunder Bay—Atikokan, Thunder Bay—Superior North, Timiskaming—Cochrane, and Timmins—James Bay.

As a result of the redistribution, none of the three major parties took fewer seats than it held at the dissolution of the previous legislature. The Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives each gained seats, while the New Democratic Party&#x27;s seat total remained unchanged.

===Incumbent MPPs who did not run for re-election===
==Opinion polls==
Since the 2003 general election, several polls were conducted to determine the ongoing preference of voters. They showed a decline in Liberal support following the 2004 Ontario budget. Overall, support for the governing Liberals declined slightly since the 2003 election, the NDP gained some ground since the 2003 election, and the PCs&#x27; poll numbers did not change significantly since 2003. Support for the Green Party increased significantly, a shift which paralleled the increase in support for the party&#x27;s federal counterpart. During the pre-election period, the Ontario Greens did not appear as an option in some of the polls.

Polls indicate results for decided voters. More information can be found in the footnotes to each poll, including undecided results, if provided by the pollster. A dash indicates the absence of a prompt for that party.

==Election results==
At 9:23 pm EDT, Citytv projected a Liberal majority government. CTV News made the same call at 9:30 pm EDT, followed by CBC News at 9:37 pm EDT, and Canadian Press at 9:52 pm EDT.

Also at 10:30 pm EDT, CBC and CTV reported that Progressive Conservative leader John Tory had called Liberal Leader Dalton McGuinty to concede the election. At 10:39 pm EDT, Tory was declared defeated by Canadian Press in the riding of Don Valley West.

At 10:43 pm EDT, Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty took the stage to give his speech to the public, breaking tradition of the defeated party leaders going first.

Each party lost at least one incumbent MPP — Liberals Mario Racco and Caroline Di Cocco, PCs Joe Tascona, Tim Peterson and John Tory and NDP Paul Ferreira were all defeated. However, each party&#x27;s losses were offset by gains in other seats. The actual changes in party standings were accounted for entirely by the four new seats resulting from redistribution and the defeat of Peterson. Overall, however, most incumbent MPPs were returned in their ridings.

McGuinty became the first Liberal leader in Ontario to win two successive majorities in the legislature since Mitchell Hepburn in the 1937 election.

==Breakdown by region==

===Northern Ontario===
All eleven ridings in Northern Ontario were retained by their incumbent parties. The popular vote, however, shifted dramatically, with several Liberal incumbents holding on only very narrowly against NDP challengers. Most notably, Bill Mauro retained Thunder Bay—Atikokan by a margin of just 36 votes against John Rafferty, whom Mauro had defeated in 2003 by a margin of over 11,000 — Rafferty, in fact, spent much of the night leading Mauro. A judicial recount on October 31 increased Mauro&#x27;s margin of victory to 50 votes. David Ramsay, similarly, trailed New Democrat John Vanthof in Timiskaming—Cochrane for much of the night, pulling ahead to a winning margin of 634 votes only in the final few polls to report. This was the narrowest margin of victory in Ramsay&#x27;s 22-year career. Michael Gravelle also retained Thunder Bay—Superior North by an uncharacteristically narrow margin over Jim Foulds.

As well, Monique Smith retained Nipissing by just 377 votes over Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Vrebosch — in 2003, she had defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Al McDonald by a wider margin of over 3,000 votes.

In keeping with this trend, New Democrat incumbents Howard Hampton and Gilles Bisson &quot;widened&quot; their margins of victory over Liberal challengers compared to 2003, and France Gélinas maintained the same margin that her predecessor, Shelley Martel, had attained in the previous election.

Notably, the rise in popular support for the New Democrats in Northern Ontario carried over into the 2008 federal election, in which the NDP won nearly every seat in the region for the first time in its history.

===Eastern Ontario===
In Eastern Ontario, the new riding of Lanark—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington was carried by PC candidate Randy Hillier, while all 13 existing ridings were carried by their incumbent parties. With the exception of Yasir Naqvi, who carried Ottawa Centre by a much smaller margin over the NDP than Richard Patten had attained in 2003, Liberals in Ottawa improved their winning margins, although outside of Ottawa the popular vote trend remained relatively stable.

===Central Ontario===
The most conservative-friendly area of the province, the PC vote largely held up, with the only Liberal gain being Aileen Carroll winning Barrie, the seat she used to represent federally. This was countered by a PC nominal gain in Newmarket—Aurora. The area also delivered the strongest support in the province for the Green Party, with Shane Jolley finishing a very strong second in Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound with 33.1% of the vote, the best finish ever received by any Green candidate in Canada to that point. The Greens also knocked the NDP into fourth place in a majority of area ridings.

===Midwestern Ontario===

A politically mixed region, Midwestern Ontario had every incumbent party re-elected, as well as some anomalous results; in an election where the PCs were largely held to rural areas, and the Liberals consolidated an urban/suburban base, Elizabeth Witmer held onto the riding of Kitchener—Waterloo for the PCs, while the Liberals won in rural ridings in which they were the incumbent party, such as Huron—Bruce and Perth—Wellington. Further away from the provincewide result, on an election night which demonstrated Liberal strength province wide, Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant delivered the most crushing defeat for a Liberal candidate in the province, with the victorious PC incumbent Toby Barrett coming out 16,571 votes and 38.6% ahead of the Liberal.

===Brampton, Mississauga &amp; Oakville===
Although the suburban Western GTA had traditionally been a good area for the PCs, winning many seats in the area as recently as the Harris days, where it formed part of the 905-area backbone of the PC government, the Liberals won every seat in the area handily, with the victorious Liberal candidates averaging at around 50%. Even Mississauga South, which prior to the 2003 election had not voted Liberal provincially since the riding&#x27;s creation, and had been expected to be a very tight race, proved a surprisingly easy victory for Charles Sousa, who gained the seat back for the Liberals from Tim Peterson, who had crossed the floor. The NDP continued to be a non-factor in the area, while the Greens growth in popular vote across the province was reflected, with the Greens even beating the NDP into fourth place in Oakville, which ironically had been the only riding in the province the Greens had not run in the previous election.

===Southern Durham and York===
The Liberals continued to dominate York Region, with each incumbent being re-elected by a comfortable margin except in Thornhill where Mario Racco lost to PC candidate Peter Shurman. The newly created riding of Ajax—Pickering, projected to be a close race, elected Liberal Joe Dickson by over 6,000 votes despite having no party nominate incumbents. In southern Durham Region, Liberal Wayne Arthurs was re-elected to the newly distributed Pickering—Scarborough East, while Progressive Conservative Christine Elliott was re-elected to Whitby—Oshawa. Despite high expectations for Sid Ryan&#x27;s fourth run as an NDP candidate in Oshawa, PC incumbent Jerry Ouellette was again re-elected by a wider majority than in 2003.

===Hamilton, Burlington &amp; Niagara===
An area with several close seats, and a fairly even distribution of seats, every party had a realistic chance of increasing its seat count here. Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, which was a merger of a Liberal held riding and an NDP held riding, and had neither incumbent running, was the most interesting match of the night, with the NDP winning a close race. It proved to be the only change of the election, and every other riding returned the incumbent party, although many in close races, such as Hamilton Mountain (Liberals over NDP), Halton, (PCs over Liberals) and Burlington (PCs over Liberals).

===Southwestern Ontario===
In an area with a strong rural-urban divide, both the NDP and PCs had strong hopes of making gains against the Liberals. The NDP had strong hopes of upsetting high-profile Liberals in both Windsor West, and Windsor—Tecumseh, given the NDP&#x27;s ownership of those seats federally, and the continued decline of the local industrial economy. London—Fanshawe was similarly also a top target, as the NDP had the riding federally and finished a close second in 2003. Overall, however, the only area seat that changed hands was Sarnia—Lambton, with Culture Minister Caroline Di Cocco, the most high-profile Liberal casualty of the night, losing to PC challenger Bob Bailey.

===Toronto===
All ridings in Toronto were retained by their incumbent parties, with the exception of York South—Weston. New Democrat Paul Ferreira, who had won the seat from the Liberals in a by-election in February 2007, was narrowly defeated by a swing back to Liberal candidate Laura Albanese. Almost twice as many people voted in the riding in the general election compared to the by-election.

In Toronto&#x27;s other notable race, Liberal incumbent Kathleen Wynne defeated PC leader John Tory in Don Valley West. Tory previously represented Dufferin—Caledon, but had chosen to run in a Toronto riding in the general election.

Toronto&#x27;s only incumbent from 2003 not to run again was Liberal MPP Mary Anne Chambers. The Liberals successfully retained the seat under new candidate Margarett Best.

<text>Theodate Pope Riddle (February 2, 1867 – August 30, 1946) was an American architect and philanthropist. She was one of the first American women architects and a survivor of the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;.

==Life==
Born Effie Brooks Pope in Cleveland, Ohio, she was the only child of industrialist and art collector Alfred Atmore Pope and his wife Ada Lunette Brooks and was a first cousin to Louisa Pope, the future mother of architect Philip Johnson.

When Effie was 19, she changed her name to Theodate in honor of her grandmother Theodate Stackpole. She graduated from Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut and later hired faculty members to tutor her privately in architecture. The first woman to become a licensed architect in New York and the sixth woman to be licensed in Connecticut, in 1926, she was appointed a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

She designed Hill-Stead, the family estate (now Hill–Stead Museum) in Farmington, and designed and founded the Avon Old Farms School in Avon, as well as Westover School.

Her best-known architectural commission was the 1920 reconstruction of the birthplace in New York City of former President Theodore Roosevelt. In the fall of 2014, Pope&#x27;s work on that site was recognized in a competition, Built by Women New York City, launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation to identify outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered, and built by women.

== Selected buildings ==
*1898–1907: Alfred Pope House, Hill-Stead, Farmington, CT (with McKim, Mead and White)
*1906–1909: Westover School, Middlebury, CT
*1911–1914: Joseph P. Chamberlain Estate, Highfield, Middlebury, CT
*1913–1914: Mrs. Charles O. Gates Estate, Dormer House, Locust Valley, Long Island, NY
*1914–1915: Hop Brook Elementary School, Naugatuck, CT
*1915: Worker&#x27;s Housing, Farmington, CT
*1918–1927: Avon Old Farms School, Avon, CT
*1919–1922: Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace (reconstruction, interior restoration, design of adjacent building) New York, NY

Her papers are archived at Hill-Stead Museum, Avon Old Farms School and the Westover School Archives.

==Professional associations==
Theodate Pope was a member of the Architectural League of New York, the Archaeological Institute of America, and the Mediaeval Academy of America.

==RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;==
On May 1, 1915, she boarded the British ocean liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; as a First Class passenger, together with her maid Miss Emily Robinson and Professor Edwin W. Friend, a fellow Farmington resident. When the ship was torpedoed by an Imperial German Navy U-boat on May 7, Pope, Robinson, and Friend made for the lifeboats. The &quot;Lusitania&#x27;s&quot; crew was inexperienced at launching the boats, and Pope saw one lifeboat tip all its passengers into the sea. Pope and Friend decided it would be better to jump from the deck. Before jumping, Theodate turned to her maid, saying, &quot;Come, Robinson.&quot;

In the water, Pope was buffeted by debris and struggling swimmers. She was struck on the head by debris. &quot;People all around me were fighting, striking and struggling,&quot; she later recalled. Then a man &quot;insane with fright&quot; made &quot;a sudden jump and landed clean on my shoulders, believing I could support him.&quot;

She lost consciousness in the water, and when she was rescued, she was initially placed among the dead until another rescued passenger, Belle Naish, recognized signs of life in her. However, it took two hours before she could be revived. Neither Robinson nor Professor Friend survived.

==Personal life==
On May 6, 1916, Theodate married 52-year-old John Wallace Riddle, a former American diplomat. Theodate took interest in parapsychology and was a member of the American Society for Psychical Research. She fell out with James H. Hyslop and resigned in 1915.

She died on August 30, 1946, at her home in Farmington.

<doc id="710694" wikidata="Q582882" url="?curid=710694" title="Antique (band)">
<text>Antique is a Swedish-Greek singing duo consisting of Helena Paparizou (; born 1982) and Nikos Panagiotidis (; born 1978), originating from Sweden and combining Greek popular music and lyrics with a Nordic dance-pop beat. Both Paparizou and Panagiotidis were born and raised in Sweden by Greek parents. They were the first ever to be nominated for a Swedish Grammis in the category modern dance with a Greek song. In 2001, Antique were selected to represent Greece at the Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen with the song &quot;Die for You&quot;, sung in a blend of English and Greek, ending with a third place – only behind Estonia and hosts Denmark. This group is famous in Scandinavian countries, Cyprus, Greece, Germany and Italy. After 19 years of hiatus the group reunited in March 2022 in Greece releasing a cover hit song from 90&#x27;s meant to be their comeback in music industry.

==Career==

In 1999, some DJ friends of Helena Paparizou&#x27;s brother asked her to make a demo of the Notis Sfakianakis hit &quot;Opa Opa&quot;. Paparizou told them that the lyrics are for a man, so she asked to sing it with her childhood friend Nikos Panagiotidis, whom she had met through her siblings at a Greek diaspora celebration in Stockholm. At that time, some record producers were undergoing a project to sign a duo consisting of a male and a female that would sing covers of traditional Greek hits oriented towards the Greek diaspora of Sweden, finally coming in contact with Paparizou, who recommended Panagiotidis; they formed Antique and were signed to newly formed indie label Bonnier Music, settling on the name because it left an impression of being &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;timeless&quot;. Paparizou admitted that Greek music had been something of an acquired taste for her, and that the name &quot;Antique&quot; was probably a reflection of her childhood impression of it being something rather distant and old-fashioned; something that she only really associated with her summer holidays in Greece. Their debut single &quot;Opa Opa&quot; became a hit amongst the Greeks in Sweden and eventually entered the top ten in Sweden and Norway, making them the first act to enter into the Swedish top five with a song sung in Greek. Their later singles &quot;Dinata Dinata&quot;, &quot;Follow Me&quot;, and &quot;Moro Mou&quot; also charted well.

=== Eurovision Song Contest 2001 ===

Despite being relatively unknown in Greece, the duo entered the national final to become Greece&#x27;s representatives in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 in Copenhagen, Denmark with the song &quot;(I Would) Die for You&quot;, written by Nikos Terzis with lyrics by Antonis Pappas, placing joint first, but being named the winners by default as they had won the public vote. The song placed third in the actual contest with 147 points; although equaled by the 2004 entry, it was the best placing Greece had ever received until Paparizou won the contest as a solo artist in 2005. The song went on to become their biggest hit in Greece, reaching Platinum status, while it peaked at number three in Sweden and Greece, and charted elsewhere. Antique&#x27;s success in the contest led to them earning recognition in Greece and working there for the rest of their career.

In continuation, they recorded four studio albums that achieved mild success, performed a small European tour, and collaborated with artists such as Katy Garbi and Slavi Trifonov. In 2002, they recorded the song &quot;V-Power&quot; in both English and Greek versions. The songs were included on the 14-track promotional album released for Royal Dutch Shell by V2 Records to promote the premium unleaded gasoline product known as &quot;V-Power&quot;. Antique disbanded in late 2003 on good terms with both members pursuing solo careers. Elena Paparizou won the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 representing Greece with &quot;My Number One&quot;. There are currently no intentions of reuniting the group, although they have both expressed to want to reunite in the future.

=== 2019–2022: New material===
Antique reunited 16 years after the group&#x27;s hiatus for a special anniversary concert on July 13, 2019, in Sweden, performing live their greatest hits for Swedish audience. In Cyprus at Super Music Awards, Panagiotidis awarded Paparizou for Best Female Adult artist.

In March 2022 Antique covered a song from the 1990s titled &quot;Ti Ti&quot; by Giorgos Alkaios, to be released in April 2022.

On July 2, 9, 23 Antique performed at Vi som älskar 90-talet (Us who love the 90s) 2022 concert festival in Sweden performing some of their hit singles.

On November 17, Antique attended Het Grote Songfestivalfeest singing &quot;Die For You&quot; which took place in Ziggo Dome arena in Amsterdam, while it will be broadcast at a later time by the public broadcaster of the Netherlands.

<text>Kingsley Arter Taft (July 19, 1903March 28, 1970) was an American politician and distant relative of Ohio&#x27;s more famous Taft family. He served as chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court and also served briefly as a United States senator. Kingsley&#x27;s father, Frederick Lovett Taft, II was also a noted figure in the Ohio legal profession.

==Biography==
Taft was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Frederick L. and Mary Alice ( Arter) Taft. He graduated from high school there and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Amherst College, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi, in 1925. He received a law degree from Harvard University in 1928. Taft then practiced as a lawyer in Ohio. He attained a partnership in the law firm that would eventually become Arter and Hadden.

Taft served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1933 to 1934. In 1940, he was elected to the Shaker Heights, Ohio, board of education on which he served until 1942, the last year as president. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, eventually rising to the rank of Major.

In 1946, when U.S. Senator Harold H. Burton (R-Ohio) resigned in order to accept an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, the vacancy was filled by a special election. In that election Taft ran and defeated Democrat Henry P. Webber. Taft served out Burton&#x27;s term, which expired in 1947. He also served with distant family member Robert A. Taft during his four-month tenure, and did not run for election to the next full term.

In 1948, he was elected to a judgeship on the Ohio Supreme Court, defeating Democrat Robert M. Sohngen. In 1954, he was re-elected to the position without opposition. In 1960, Taft defeated Joseph H. Ellison for a third term on the Supreme Court, but in 1962, Taft decided to run for Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. Taft then beat Democratic incumbent Carl V. Weygandt. Weygant, who was 74 years old and seeking a sixth term, lost by a margin of less than 1,600 votes, out of more than 2.6 million votes cast. In 1968, Taft was re-elected Chief Justice of the Court, defeating Democrat John C. Duffy, but died in office two years after his last election in 1970.

==Personal life==
Taft met his wife Louise Dakin at college. They were married September 14, 1927. They had four sons.

Taft was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

<doc id="710704" wikidata="Q949174" url="?curid=710704" title="Classical language">
<text>According to the definition by George L. Hart, a classical language is any language with an independent literary tradition and a large body of ancient written literature. 

Classical languages are usually extinct languages. Those that are still in use today tend to show highly diglossic characteristics in areas where they are used, as the difference between spoken and written language has widened over time.

== Classical studies ==

In the context of traditional European classical studies, the &quot;classical languages&quot; refer to Greek and Latin, which were the literary languages of the Mediterranean world in classical antiquity.

Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian, Hellenistic and Byzantine historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology. Koine Greek, which served as a lingua franca in the Eastern Roman Empire, remains in use today as a sacred language in some Eastern Orthodox churches.

Latin became the lingua franca of the early Roman Empire and later of the Western Roman Empire. Despite the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Latin language continued to flourish in the very different social and economic environment of the Middle Ages, not least because it became the official language of the Roman Catholic Church. In Western and Central Europe and in parts of northern Africa, Latin retained its elevated status as the main vehicle of communication for the learned classes throughout the Middle Ages and subsequently; witness especially the Renaissance and Baroque periods. And well into the 21st century, Latin is still taught in the United States, mostly in elite private schools.

Latin was not supplanted for scientific purposes until the 18th century, and for formal descriptions in zoology as well as botany it survived to the later 20th century. The modern international binomial nomenclature holds to this day: taxonomists assign a Latin or Latinized name as the scientific name of each species.

== Outside of western civilization ==

In terms of worldwide cultural importance, Edward Sapir in his 1921 book &quot;Language&quot; extends the list to include classical Chinese, Arabic, and Sanskrit:

When we realize that an educated Japanese can hardly frame a single literary sentence without the use of Chinese resources, that to this day Siamese and Burmese and Cambodgian bear the unmistakable imprint of the Sanskrit and Pali that came in with Hindu Buddhism centuries ago, or that whether we argue for or against the teaching of Latin and Greek [in schools,] our argument is sure to be studded with words that have come to us from Rome and Athens, we get some indication of what early Chinese culture and Buddhism, and classical Mediterranean civilization have meant in the world&#x27;s history. There are just five languages that have had an overwhelming significance as carriers of culture. They are classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Arabic, Greek, and Latin. In comparison with these, even such culturally important languages as Hebrew and French sink into a secondary position.

In this sense, a classical language is a language that has a broad influence over an extended period of time, even after it is no longer a colloquial mother tongue in its original form. If one language uses roots from another language to coin words (in the way that many European languages use Greek and Latin roots to devise new words such as &quot;telephone&quot;, etc.), this is an indication that the second language is a classical language.

In comparison, living languages with a large sphere of influence are known as world languages.

== General usage ==

The following languages are generally taken to have a &quot;classical&quot; stage. Such a stage is limited in time and is considered &quot;classical&quot; if it comes to be regarded as a literary &quot;golden age&quot; retrospectively. Thus, Classical Greek is the language of 5th to 4th century BC Athens and, as such, only a small subset of the varieties of the Greek language as a whole. A &quot;classical&quot; period usually corresponds to a flowering of literature following an &quot;archaic&quot; period, such as Classical Latin succeeding Old Latin, Classical Sumerian succeeding Archaic Sumerian, Classical Sanskrit succeeding Vedic Sanskrit, Classical Persian succeeding Old Persian. This is partly a matter of terminology, and for example Old Chinese is taken to include rather than precede Classical Chinese. In some cases, such as those of Persian and Tamil, the &quot;classical&quot; stage corresponds to the earliest attested literary variant.

<text>Mark Owen (born 27 January 1972) is an English singer and songwriter best known for being a member of pop group and band Take That; as of 2024, the group have sold 14.4 million albums and 13.8 million singles in the UK. In Owen&#x27;s solo career, he has released five studio albums: &quot;Green Man&quot; (1996), &quot;In Your Own Time&quot; (2003), &quot;How the Mighty Fall&quot; (2005), &quot;The Art of Doing Nothing&quot; (2013) and his most recent, &quot;Land of Dreams&quot;, which was released in September 2022 and debuted at number 5 on the UK Official Albums Chart.

==Early life==
Growing up, Owen lived in a small council house with his mother Mary, his father Keith, brother Daniel, and sister Tracey in Oldham. His father was a decorator, later getting a job at a police station. His mother was a supervisor in a bakery. Owen was educated at Holy Rosary Primary and St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Schools, both in Oldham. He had little interest in music and played football briefly for Chadderton F.C., in addition to having trials at Manchester United and Rochdale. Before auditioning for Take That, he worked at Barclays in Failsworth.

==Take That==

===1989–1996: Early success===
After selecting Gary Barlow as the group&#x27;s lead singer in 1989, Nigel Martin-Smith introduced Owen, Howard Donald, Jason Orange and finally Robbie Williams to the fold. The group were signed to RCA records, and after a number of top 40 hits, eventually secured their first number one with Barlow&#x27;s &quot;Pray&quot;. Previous hits included &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot;, &quot;It Only Takes a Minute&quot; and &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;.

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Take That &amp; Party&quot; was released on 17 August 1992. It reached number two on the UK Album Chart. The following year saw the release of their second album, &quot;Everything Changes&quot;. It went straight in at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles, as well as &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Wake Up with You&quot; and &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Here Anymore&quot; hitting number two and three respectively. Owen sang lead vocals on &quot;Babe&quot;, which was released in December 1993. Their third album &quot;Nobody Else&quot; went straight to number 1 and was to be their last studio album of the &#x27;90s. The album had three number-one singles, including &quot;Back for Good&quot; which peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was brought forward an unprecedented six weeks before its official release such was the demand for the single. Owen also sang lead vocals on &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; from the album. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection followed again reaching number one. The album featured the band&#x27;s eighth number-one single &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;. This was to be the first single released by Take That as a four piece (without Williams) and it was their last single until they reformed in 2005.

Although Owen&#x27;s vocal contributions were limited in Take That&#x27;s original run, he was arguably the most popular member of the group, on account of his boyish good looks and sweet demeanour, regularly earning awards such as Smash Hits&#x27; &quot;Most Fanciable Male in the World&quot; and &quot;Best Haircut&quot;.

===2005–present: Reunion===
Owen returned to the spotlight in the TV documentary, &quot;Take That: For the Record&quot; in 2005. Following this success and renewed interest, Take That experienced a career renaissance in 2005 when the post-Williams line-up reformed for a sell-out stadium tour. The band released their comeback single &quot;Patience&quot; which went to number 1 for four weeks while also topping the charts across Europe. Patience was also voted The Record of the Year in 2006 and won a Brit for single of the year. This was followed with &quot;Shine&quot; which featured Owen on lead vocals and became the band&#x27;s tenth number-one single. Take That&#x27;s first album of new material in over ten years, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, was released on 24 November 2006. The album peaked at number 1 in the UK Album Chart selling over 2.8 million copies in the UK alone to date. It was re-released as a tour edition with hit single &quot;Rule the World&quot; in 2007 and peaked again at number 1.

In June and July 2009, Take That performed the record breaking tour Take That Presents: The Circus Live throughout the United Kingdom which sold over one million tickets in five hours.

It was announced that the group was in the process of writing Take That&#x27;s sixth studio album, set for release in late 2010. The album, &quot;Progress&quot;, was the first to feature the original line-up since their 1995 album, &quot;Nobody Else&quot;. The band also announced a stadium tour entitled Progress Live which took place in 2011. The tickets for the tour went on sale on 29 October 2010. Due to unprecedented high public demand for tickets, ticketmaster websites across the UK and Ireland crashed and all initial tour dates sold out in under 15 minutes. It was reported that a record breaking one million tickets were snapped up on the first day of sale, resulting in Take That smashing the previous box office record of tickets sold which was set in 2008 by Take That Present: The Circus Live.

The lead single from &quot;Progress&quot; was announced as &quot;The Flood&quot;. The single debuted at number 2, selling over 500,000 copies since release. On the first day of the release of &quot;Progress&quot;, the album sold over 235,000 copies across the UK, making it the fastest selling record of the century.
On 21 November 2010, &quot;Progress&quot; debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, becoming the band&#x27;s seventh number-one album. By the end of its first week on sale the album sold over 520,000, making it the second fastest-selling album of all-time in UK chart history. To date &quot;Progress&quot; has sold 2.4 million copies in the UK and has achieved similar chart success across Europe. In June 2011, Take That released their first extended play collection entitled Progressed which returned the band to number 1 in the UK on its first week of release as well as charting across Europe.

==Solo career==

===1996–1997: &quot;Green Man&quot;===
After Take That split, Owen became the first of the band&#x27;s ex-members to release a solo record. He reached number three in the UK Singles Chart with his debut single, &quot;Child&quot;. His second single, &quot;Clementine&quot;, also went to number three. In 1996 his album &quot;Green Man&quot; was released, charting at a number 33. After another single, &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;, charted at number 29, Owen was dropped by BMG Records in late 1997.

===2002–2003: &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and &quot;In Your Own Time&quot;===
Owen won the second series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in November 2002 with 77% of the public vote against television presenter Les Dennis. Owen broke down in tears, overwhelmed by the fans&#x27; support. After being invited to perform on stage with Robbie Williams at Knebworth, he returned to the spotlight and signed a deal with Island/Universal Records. In August 2003, Owen returned to the charts with the Top 5 hit, &quot;Four Minute Warning&quot;, which remained in the Top 40 for eight weeks. His second album, &quot;In Your Own Time&quot;, was released in November 2003, entering the charts at number 59. After a second single, &quot;Alone Without You&quot;, charted at number 26, Owen was dropped by Island/Universal Records.

===2004–2006: &quot;How the Mighty Fall&quot;===
In April 2004 he established his own record company, Sedna Records. One report around 2004 alleged that Owen was looking for a day job, but he simply said &quot;Doing it properly isn&#x27;t cheap. These are my indulgences. I don&#x27;t have a Ferrari, I have two albums.&quot;
Mark released his first single &quot;Makin&#x27; Out&quot; which charted at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart, making it his highest charted single released in an independent label. He released his third solo album, &quot;How the Mighty Fall&quot; on 18 April 2005, which was recorded at Sunset Studios, Los Angeles, in 2004. It reached No. 56 in Germany. Owen said that it was more &quot;his&quot; album than the last couple because he had had full control over every aspect of the record and it was a true representation of where he was in his life. On the strength of this release, he was picked up by Caroline Elleray (Coldplay, Keane), resulting in his signing his publishing deal to BMG Music Publishing. Mark released his second single &quot;Believe in the Boogie&quot;, charting at No. 57 in the UK charts, making it his lowest charting single at that time. Although it did not chart well, his second single was added to the European soundtrack of the American film &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot; starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. In February 2006 he released &quot;Hail Mary&quot; as a single from the album.

===2012–2013: &quot;The Art of Doing Nothing&quot;===
In March 2012, according to a report by &quot;The Sun&quot; Mark was planning to relaunch his solo career. A source said: &quot;Mark has already made serious headway. He has put together new material in the studio with top writers and is planning more sessions over the next few months. All the lads are behind him. Success in his own right and his own writing material have always been a massive motivation, so he&#x27;s a happy man.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; announced in October 2012 that Owen had finished recording the album and planned to tour the following spring.

In March 2013, further details of the album emerged, including the album title, &quot;The Art of Doing Nothing&quot;. The album was then mixed in New York at the Electric Lady Studios by Michael Brauer, Charlie Russell, Ben Mark and Jamie Norton. He confirmed the album would feature a collaboration with singer-songwriter Ren Harvieu, and production from Alt-J producer Charlie Russell. A source said: &quot;Mark is really excited about the album – he sees it more as a collaborative work than a solo album, something he made with a collection of his friends. He&#x27;s worked with some really interesting people on it including Ren Harvieu and Charlie Russell, the producer who has worked with Alt-J, as well as some brilliant illustrators, photographers and film makers. People will be surprised by the results – it&#x27;s not what fans will expect.&quot; The album was to be released on 10 June 2013.

On 1 May 2013, Owen uploaded new photographs and videos to his official website, including the deluxe album artwork, which depicts him in a white room, scribbling on the wall, whilst wearing a dapper hat. A tagline to accompany the artwork reads: &quot;Every idea has a starting place. Nothing begins in an empty space.&quot; The two videos consist of a montage video, picturing the photo shoot that shot the album cover, and the second, which is a short interview with Owen, in which he discusses the album&#x27;s contents and cover. Following the announcement of his fourth studio album, Owen also confirmed that he would tour the UK and Germany throughout June.

===2022–present: &quot;Land of Dreams&quot;===
On 1 February 2022, it was revealed that Owen had been writing new material, potentially for a new solo album. A source close to Owen said, &quot;He has been writing some songs and they are sounding pretty good. It&#x27;s said the singer will be performing at the Isle of Wight Festival in June, It is early days, but he is [...] toying with the idea of another solo record. Nothing is nailed down, but given he has done a solo album every 10 years or so for the last two decades, now feels like a nice time to think about it again.&quot;

On 13 May 2022, Owen officially announced on his social media platforms that he was making a new record, but shared no further details at the time. On 18 May 2022, he announced his new album &quot;Land of Dreams&quot;, alongside its first single &quot;You Only Want Me&quot;.

On 19 May 2022, &quot;You Only Want Me&quot; was released as the lead single, alongside the announcement of the release date of the album, which is 23 September 2022. The single entered the UK Downloads charts at number 76 and the UK Sales charts at 78. Owen performed the song at the National Lottery Big Jubilee party, along with the Take That hit &quot;Shine&quot;. Owen also performed his single live on The Late Late Show with James Corden, his first US televised performance as a solo artist, and second overall. On 10 June 2022, his second single &quot;Are You Looking for Billy?&quot; was released. This was followed on 10 August 2022, with third single &quot;Magic&quot;. &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; was released on 23 September 2022. On 26 September, the UK Official Charts predicted that the album would chart at number 2 on the Official Albums Charts. On 30 September 2022, the album debuted at number 5 on the UK Official Albums Chart Top 100, becoming Owen&#x27;s highest charting solo studio album. &quot;Land of Dreams&quot; debuted at number 3 on the UK Album Downloads and Sales Charts. Due to digital sales of the album, &quot;Magic&quot; debuted at number 76 on the UK Official Singles Sales Chart Top 100.

==Personal life==
Owen is married to actress Emma Ferguson. They have a son and two daughters. He is a patron of the charity Beyond Autism.

In March 2010, in the midst of recording for &quot;Progress&quot;, Owen publicly admitted to having multiple affairs, one of which lasted from late 2004 until September 2009, and an alcohol problem. Six months later, he checked into a private clinic for rehabilitation related to his drinking.

In June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That band-mates Howard Donald and Gary Barlow, Owen had invested £26 million in music industry investment schemes. The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as tax shelters for high-net-worth people. Lawyers responded to the claims, stating the band members &quot;paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises.&quot; In an interview with BBC Radio in 2020, Paul Stenning, who worked for the band in 1995 under their financial advisor Simon Orange, explained the way the band&#x27;s finances were structured, saying they were &quot;meticulously disseminated&quot;.

In 2014, Owen was announced as an Ambassador for Amber Run on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Launched&quot;. Owen also participated in both Soccer Aid 2012 and 2014.
He is a supporter of Liverpool Football Club. In 2024 Owen released a coffee blend named &#x27;Shine&#x27; in collaboration with &quot;Change Please&quot;, a social enterprise aiming to tackle homelessness.

<doc id="710713" wikidata="Q1299587" url="?curid=710713" title="Trespasser (video game)">
<text>Trespasser is a 1998 action-adventure video game developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows. The game serves as a sequel to the 1997 film &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, taking place a year after the film&#x27;s events. Players control Anne, the sole survivor of a plane crash that leaves her stranded on a remote island with genetically engineered dinosaurs. It features the voices of Minnie Driver as Anne and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, reprising his role from the film series.

The game engine of &quot;Trespasser&quot; was advanced for its time and required a fast and powerful computer to adequately display the game&#x27;s detailed graphics without pixelation artifacts. Upon release, the game received mixed to negative reviews and disappointed many critics, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; declaring it &quot;the worst game of 1998&quot;. The mixed reception is believed to have been caused by rushing the development to reach the 1998 release date and the game&#x27;s overly ambitious and advanced nature.

==Plot==
John Hammond, a rich industrialist, used his wealth to assemble a scientific team that cloned dinosaurs. An amusement park showcasing his biological attractions fails when the dinosaurs escape. While Jurassic Park was built on Isla Nublar, off the coast of Costa Rica, the animals were raised at an alternate location, Isla Sorna, also named Site B. &quot;Trespasser&quot; takes place a year after the events of &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, where the general public learned about the existence of Jurassic Park.

The player controls Anne, whose plane has crashed on the way to Costa Rica. Anne awakens on the shores of an island, apparently the sole survivor of the crash, and proceeds to explore. Anne learns she is on Site B. Pursued by dinosaurs, Anne makes use of weapons left behind to defend herself. She follows a monorail track into the island interior. After recovering security cards from an InGen town and rebooting a computer to activate a mountain-top radio tower, Anne proceeds to the large mountain and ascends. At the summit, Anne contacts the United States Navy on an emergency channel. After defeating the Alpha &quot;Velociraptor&quot; and its tribe that lives atop the mountain, she is rescued by helicopter. Anne returns to her apartment and listens to her messages, including one from her friend asking where Anne&#x27;s been and says she had better have &quot;a real good excuse&quot;...immediately afterward, Anne tosses a velociraptor claw on the table near the machine.

==Gameplay==
The entire game is played through the eyes of Anne (voiced by Driver). There are only three cutscenes, one that begins the game and one that concludes the game, and an introductory video. There is occasional orchestral music, scored by Bill Brown. As she traverses the island, Anne will often talk to herself or remember clips of John Hammond&#x27;s memoirs (voiced by Richard Attenborough) describing the creation (and downfall) of Jurassic Park. There are no time limits or difficulty settings to adjust and only the first level has text prompts to aid players that are new to the game.

This game features no HUD. Anne&#x27;s health is represented by a heart-shaped tattoo on her breast that the player can look down to. The ink of the tattoo is filled in depending on the amount of damage she has taken; when it is filled completely and a chain appears around it, Anne dies. Anne&#x27;s health regenerates quickly over time as long as she does not take further damage. To track weapon ammunition without a HUD, players must rely on Anne verbally describing weapons she picks up, and she weighs the weapon in her hand and says phrases like &quot;About eight shots&quot;, &quot;Feels full&quot; and &quot;Hasn&#x27;t been used&quot;, along with verbally counting down ammunition as she fires a weapon.

By pressing a key, Anne will extend her arm out into the game world, allowing the player to pick up, swing, push and throw objects. This allows the player to create improvised weaponry, for instance: picking up a large rock off the ground and hitting an enemy with it. Anne can move her arm in any direction, allowing the player to get a different feel of use for each weapon. Anne can only carry two items at once and when bumping into things will often drop items.

In addition to picking objects off the ground to use as weapons, Anne can find and use various other armaments including key cards and diskettes. In situations requiring button input (such as keypads), Anne will extend one of her fingers. In keeping with the &quot;hyper realistic&quot; vision of the game, firearms have no cross-hairs. The player aligns the gun by adjusting Anne&#x27;s wrist and then manually moving her arm to aim. Anne can carry up to two weapons at a time. Weapons have been made to incorporate realistic recoil, as if being held with two hands. Once each firearm is empty, it can be used as a club when swung. Empty weapons cannot be reloaded. All weapons must be discarded at the end of each level. Hints and keypad codes appear in unexpected places on walls, often in a level or two before they are needed.

==Development==
The game was initiated by two former employees of Looking Glass Technologies, Seamus Blackley and Austin Grossman. With the film &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; expected to be a success and after securing the movie license, the pair approached several movie animation groups before signing with DreamWorks Interactive. Adobe Photoshop 5 and 3D Studio Max were used to produce the game. A 3D model of the island was built and digitally scanned to construct the game environment. John Williams was contracted to compose music exclusively for the game.

&quot;Trespasser&quot; went severely over-budget several times throughout its development. Originally, the game was to be released in the fall of 1997. However, due to a number of problems and how advanced the game was becoming, the project was delayed by a year. The rush to release the game caused many features to either be cut, or left unfinished and unpolished. Anne&#x27;s left arm was removed from the game due to difficulties coding the behaviour of both arms together. A late shift in development effectively changed the game&#x27;s genre from survival horror to action shooter, resulting in many complaints upon release. Additional problems were caused by the lack of experienced management and the use of artists who were unfamiliar with basic game development processes and 3D modeling. Art director Terry Izumi&#x27;s background, for example, consisted of being a designer for Tomorrowland, and George Edwards was a veteran animator of Disney films.

After developing for over two years, DreamWorks Interactive informed the development team in April 1998 that as part of a deal with AMD, &quot;Trespasser&quot; would need to release in October of that year even though Blackley estimated &quot;Trespasser&quot; needed at least another year of development to be release-ready. The team rushed the remainder of development, and &quot;Trespasser&quot; released as an unfinished game set in a very large and open outdoor environment. These issues were also caused by the game development starting before the 3dfx Voodoo 1 moved towards 3D hardware. As a result, some techniques, including bump mapping and image caching, were incompatible with graphics processing units. Near the end of development the programmers developed a renderer that drew bump mapped objects in software and the terrain in hardware, but most objects were bump mapped so the speed advantages of hardware acceleration were negated. &quot;Trespasser&quot; used many textures for its mip levels and image cache, more than the most highly lauded gaming card of the time, the Voodoo2, could handle, and the game used the lower resolution textures in hardware mode instead of the high resolution ones available in software mode. This resulted in the game running faster and in some ways looking better in software mode, while running in hardware mode meant the game ran slower and had more blurry looking textures.

The &quot;Trespasser&quot; engine contained several features not normally seen in game engines at the time. In 1998, it was one of the first engines to successfully portray outdoor environments full of hundreds of trees. It accomplished this by rendering terrain to an offscreen cache and then only redrawing objects when the player character moves significantly. Computers in 1998 could not render the complex environments it generated. The terrain modeler was created by Mark Langerak, formerly head of development at Sega Europe. In addition, the &quot;Trespasser&quot; engine featured the first game world to be completely influenced by classical mechanics and was also the first game to use ragdoll physics. One of the most advanced features of the rendering engine was the ability to render objects like trees and rocks as 2D sprites, which, when close enough to Anne, would be replaced by their 3D counterpart. Elements using this technique are known as &quot;impostors&quot;. This often led to an ugly &quot;popping&quot; where a low-resolution object suddenly &quot;pops&quot; into 3D.

&quot;Trespasser&quot; features a robust physics system, but instead of accurate, per-polygon collisions, &quot;Trespasser&quot; uses a &quot;Box System&quot; where every object in the game acts as if it is encased in an invisible box. Additionally, &quot;Trespasser&#x27;s&quot; physics are based on the Penalty Force Method, in which, when two objects collide, rather than stopping movement the two objects push away from one another until they are no longer colliding. In the final release the dinosaurs were disallowed from making jump attacks and entering buildings to avoid interpenetration, a glitch where two objects will collide and then become stuck inside one another.

Andrew Grant was &quot;Trespasser&#x27;s&quot; chief artificial intelligence programmer. Every animation in &quot;Trespasser&quot; is done using inverse kinematics. No animation in the game is pre-animated; every movement of every dinosaur is generated automatically through their artificial intelligence. Due to the rushed nature of development, this feature resulted in awkward movement as the dinosaurs performed unnaturally. &quot;Trespasser&quot; was designed to have a complex artificial intelligence routine, giving each creature on the island its own set of emotions and the possibility of dinosaurs fighting each other. Dinosaurs would react to the player differently depending on what mood they were in. However, system bugs in the artificial intelligence routines made it so that dinosaurs would switch between mood-based actions so quickly that they would stop moving and acting. A quick fix was hard-coded into the game that maximized the anger and hunger emotions of carnivorous dinosaurs and left all other emotions at zero.

==Reception==

Before the release of the game, it was announced that &quot;Trespasser&quot; would revolutionize PC gaming, however reviews after release were mostly negative. &quot;Trespasser&quot; was a critical and commercial failure, selling about 50,000 copies. Many reviewers disliked the poor graphics performance on even the fastest graphically accelerated PCs available upon the game&#x27;s release, but some praised the title&#x27;s originality and scale. Despite the anticipation over the many &quot;first attempts at&quot; within the game&#x27;s original development scope, the reality did not match the hype.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; rated it two stars out of five, and stated that &quot;the dinosaurs are amazing looking and have great AI. There are even times when you can see how, with a fast enough processor, this could have been fun. In the end, though, it&#x27;s clear that &quot;Trespasser&quot; had a reach that exceeded its grasp.&quot;

Alex Huhtala of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the game a score of 1 out of 5, criticising the &quot;technically impressive&quot; in-game physics for making simple actions frustrating to perform, and concluding &quot;&quot;Trespasser&quot; is possibly the worst game I&#x27;ve ever played.&quot; A review by Kim Randell published on the &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; website in 2001 called the game &quot;a dog&#x27;s dinner&quot; and gave it a score of 1 out of 10. It described elements of the physics engine, such as Anne&#x27;s difficulty holding onto items without dropping them, as wholly unrealistic. A &quot;GameSpot&quot; review by Elliot Chin described it as the most frustrating game he had ever played with &quot;boring gameplay and annoying bugs&quot;. He lambasted the needlessly complicated physics engine, levels being over-filled with box-stacking puzzles, and a clumsy arm interface. One reviewer said it had the worst clipping he had ever seen with another reviewer finding the game experienced slowdown and frame rate drops. Other complaints included exploration being tiresome due to slow movement speed, landscapes being barren with few dinosaurs, graphical glitches, and poor voice acting.

An &quot;IGN&quot; review was more favourable, describing the plot as &quot;super-intriguing&quot; with high praise for the realism of the game&#x27;s physics engine. While deriding the blocky and heavily pixelated environment that offered limited interaction, and the erratic and impossible arm movements, the reviewer said the dinosaurs were convincing and &quot;looked and moved really well&quot; and concluded the game was badly implemented but still ground-breaking. &quot;Game Revolution&quot; described the game&#x27;s graphical engine as gorgeous with impressive real-time shadows and good water and particle physics. On the downside, it said the gameplay is very basic with the usual &quot;key-finding, enemy-killing, button-pushing&quot; of the FPS genre, and that when there was more than one dinosaur on-screen the game slowed considerably. An &quot;AllGame&quot; reviewer didn&#x27;t like the bugs and graphical glitches or the slow frame rate but concluded the game was a &quot;ground breaking title that offers some great thrills, challenges, puzzles, and rewarding gameplay&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; thought the game got the atmospherics right. &quot;PC Zone&quot; felt the game could be quite frightening but that there were too many guns scattered around the island. An &quot;Adrenaline Vault&quot; review liked the game&#x27;s originality and some tense moments, but disliked the slow treks, the lack of a real inventory system, the frustrating interface and there being too many guns lying around. He found the arm manipulation cumbersome and frustrating during the heat of battle, as it requires up to five buttons to be pressed.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; awarded the game &quot;Coaster of the Year&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; included &quot;Trespasser&quot; as one of nominees for the title of the Most Disappointing Game of the Year (&quot;losing&quot; to &quot;Star Wars Rebellion&quot;) and awarded it the Worst Game of the Year (PC), commenting: &quot;Of all the games released this year, none was as ill-received and terrible as Trespasser. No game was implemented as poorly, and no game squandered its potential as much. No game played as awfully. (...) There&#x27;s one thing we won&#x27;t forget: Trespasser was undoubtedly the worst game of 1998.&quot;

== Fan community ==
Although &quot;Trespasser&quot; was a critical and commercial failure, substantial amateur interest in the game persisted for years, coalescing into online fan communities such as the Trespasser Hacking Society and Trespasser Secrets, both now defunct, and TresCom, which remains active as of 2024. Members of these communities developed fan-made software to examine, preview, and eventually edit &quot;Trespasser&quot;, such as the &quot;TresEd&quot; level editor. The fan community was also able to acquire the original source code to create modifications and unofficial patches. For example, &quot;Trespasser CE&quot; allows players to play the original &quot;Trespasser&quot; game at higher resolutions and frame rates without experiencing crashes. In 2014, based on this available source code, a code review was done by Fabien Sanglard which revealed several design aspects of the game.

== Legacy ==
Despite lackluster reviews, &quot;Trespasser&quot; went on to influence game developers who were interested in the game&#x27;s ideas and flawed but innovative mechanics. The game&#x27;s unique control scheme inspired at least two indie titles, &quot;Surgeon Simulator 2013&quot; and the original &quot;Octodad,&quot; whose developers have referred to &quot;Trespasser&quot; as a source of inspiration. &quot;Trespasser&quot;&#x27;s outdoor level design also partly inspired the use of outdoor environments in level design for FPS games such as &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Far Cry&quot; series. Id Software cofounder John Carmack also cited &quot;Trespasser&quot;&#x27;s use of voiceover narration for storytelling as one inspiration for &quot;Doom 3&quot; eschewing cutscenes in favor of audio logs for its storytelling.

Despite its failures, &quot;Trespasser&quot; is generally recognized as the first game to incorporate a full physics engine. Gabe Newell cited &quot;Trespasser&quot; as influential to &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;&#x27;s physics, though its failure caused him and the rest of Valve to worry about the potential for negative comparisons between the two. In September 2019, &quot;Trespasser&quot; was spotlighted in the 172nd episode of the webseries &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;, with Seamus Blackley making a guest appearance to discuss the game&#x27;s development.

Around 2012, as Steven Spielberg was preparing to revive the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise, he contacted Blackley about making a new &quot;Trespasser&quot; game. Blackley developed a concept titled &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, in which the dinosaurs from Isla Sorna escaped and forced humans to reevaluate their place in the world. The game would focus on Billy Brennan, a character in the 2001 film &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Having been hired to prevent further escapes, Brennan would travel to the island and eventually become allies with a pack of raptors. Due to a management change at Universal Pictures, the project was cancelled and Blackley turned the assets over to Frank Marshall, who produced the 2015 film &quot;Jurassic World&quot;.
