<text>The ethics of technology is a sub-field of ethics addressing ethical questions specific to the technology age, the transitional shift in society wherein personal computers and subsequent devices provide for the quick and easy transfer of information. Technology ethics is the application of ethical thinking to growing concerns as new technologies continue to rise in prominence.

The topic has evolved as technologies have developed. Technology poses an ethical dilemma on producers and consumers alike. 

The subject of technoethics, or the ethical implications of technology, have been studied by different philosophers such as Hans Jonas and Mario Bunge.

==Technoethics==
Technoethics (TE) is an interdisciplinary research area that draws on theories and methods from multiple knowledge domains (such as communications, social sciences, information studies, technology studies, applied ethics, and philosophy) to provide insights on ethical dimensions of technological systems and practices for advancing a technological society.

Technoethics views technology and ethics as socially embedded enterprises and focuses on discovering the ethical uses for technology, protecting against the misuse of technology, and devising common principles to guide new advances in technological development and application to benefit society. Typically, scholars in technoethics have a tendency to conceptualize technology and ethics as interconnected and embedded in life and society. Technoethics denotes a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology – from specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning the role of technology in society and everyday life.

Technoethical perspectives are constantly in transition as technology advances in areas unseen by creators and as users change the intended uses of new technologies. Humans cannot be separated from these technologies because it is an inherent part of consciousness. The short term and longer term ethical considerations for technologies engage the creator, producer, user, and governments.

With the increasing impact emerging technologies have on society, the importance of assessing ethical and social issues constantly becomes more important. While such technologies provide opportunities for novel applications and the potential to transform the society on a global scale, their rise is accompanied by new ethical challenges and problems that must be considered. This becomes more difficult with the increasing pace at which technology is progressing and the increasing impact it has on the societal understanding by seemingly outrunning human control. The concept of technoethics focuses on expanding the knowledge of existing research in the areas of technology and ethics in order to provide a holistic construct for the different aspects and subdisciplines of ethics related to technology-related human activity like economics, politics, globalization, and scientific research. It is also concerned with the rights and responsibilities that designers and developers have regarding the outcomes of the respective technology. This is of particular importance with the emergence of algorithmic technology capable of making decisions autonomously and the related issues of developer or data bias influencing these decisions. To work against the manifestation of these biases, the balance between human and technology accountability for ethical failure has to be carefully evaluated and has shifted the view from technology as a merely positive tool towards the perception of technology as inherently neutral. Technoethics thus has to focus on both sides of the human technology equation when confronted with upcoming technology innovations and applications.

With technology continuing to advance over time, there are new technoethical issues that come into play. For instance, discussions on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have brought about a huge concern for technology, ethics, and safety. There is also a huge question of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) should be trusted and relied upon. These are just some examples of how the advancements in technology will affect the ethical values of humans in the future.

Technoethics finds application in various areas of technology. The following key areas are mentioned in the literature:

* Computer ethics: Focuses on the use of technology in areas including visual technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
* Engineering ethics: Dealing with professional standards of engineers and their moral responsibilities to the public.
* Internet ethics and cyberethics: Concerning the guarding against unethical Internet activity.
* Media and communication technoethics: Concerning ethical issues and responsibilities when using mass media and communication technology.
* Professional technoethics: Concerning all ethical considerations that revolve around the role of technology within professional conduct like in engineering, journalism, or medicine.
* Educational technoethics: Concerning the ethical issues and outcomes associated with using technology for educational aims.
* Biotech ethics: Linked to advances in bioethics and medical ethics like considerations arising in cloning, human genetic engineering, and stem cell research.
* Environmental technoethics: Concerning technological innovations that impact the environment and life.
* Nanoethics: Concerning ethical and social issues associated with developments in the alteration of matter at the level of atoms and molecules in various disciplines including computer science, engineering, and biology.
* Military technoethics: Concerning ethical issues associated with technology use in military action.

==Definitions==

*Ethics address the issues of what is &#x27;right&#x27;, what is &#x27;just&#x27;, and what is &#x27;fair&#x27;. Ethics describe moral principles influencing conduct; accordingly, the study of ethics focuses on the actions and values of people in society (what people do and how they believe they should act in the world).
*Technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment; it may draw upon a variety of fields, including industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science. Technology &quot;is core to human development and a key focus for understanding human life, society and human consciousness.&quot;

Using theories and methods from multiple domains, technoethics provides insights on ethical aspects of technological systems and practices, examines technology-related social policies and interventions, and provides guidelines for how to ethically use new advancements in technology. Technoethics provides a systems theory and methodology to guide a variety of separate areas of inquiry into human-technological activity and ethics. Moreover, the field unites both technocentric and bio-centric philosophies, providing &quot;conceptual grounding to clarify the role of technology to those affected by it and to help guide ethical problem solving and decision making in areas of activity that rely on technology.&quot; As a bio-techno-centric field, technoethics &quot;has a relational orientation to both technology and human activity&quot;; it provides &quot;a system of ethical reference that justifies that profound dimension of technology as a central element in the attainment of a &#x27;finalized&#x27; perfection of man.&quot;

==Fundamental problems==
Technology is merely a tool like a device or gadget. With this thought process of technology just being a device or gadget, it is not possible for technology to possess a moral or ethical quality. Going by this thought process the tool maker or end user would be the one who decides the morality or ethicality behind a device or gadget. &quot;Ethics of technology&quot; refers to two basic subdivisions:
*The ethics involved in the development of new technology—whether it is always, never, or contextually right or wrong to invent and implement a technological innovation.
*The ethical questions that are exacerbated by the ways in which technology extends or curtails the power of individuals—how standard ethical questions are changed by the new powers.

In the former case, ethics of such things as computer security and computer viruses asks whether the very act of innovation is an ethically right or wrong act. Similarly, does a scientist have an ethical obligation to produce or fail to produce a nuclear weapon? What are the ethical questions surrounding the production of technologies that waste or conserve energy and resources? What are the ethical questions surrounding the production of new manufacturing processes that might inhibit employment, or might inflict suffering in the third world?

In the latter case, the ethics of technology quickly break down into the ethics of various human endeavors as they are altered by new technologies. For example, bioethics is now largely consumed with questions that have been exacerbated by the new life-preserving technologies, new cloning technologies, and new technologies for implantation. In law, the right of privacy is being continually attenuated by the emergence of new forms of surveillance and anonymity. The old ethical questions of privacy and free speech are given new shape and urgency in an Internet age. Such tracing devices as RFID, biometric analysis and identification, genetic screening, all take old ethical questions and amplify their significance. As you can see, the fundamental problem is as society produces and advances technology that we use in all areas of our life from work, school, medicine, surveillance, etc. we receive great benefits, but there are underlying costs to these benefits. As technology evolves even more, some of the technological innovations can be seen as inhumane and those same technological innovations can be seen by others as creative, life changing, and innovative.

==History of technoethics==
Though the ethical consequences of new technologies have existed since Socrates&#x27; attack on writing in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, the formal field of technoethics had only existed for a few decades. The first traces of TE can be seen in Dewey and Peirce&#x27;s pragmatism. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, it was easy to see that technological advances were going to influence human activity. This is why they put emphasis on the responsible use of technology.

The term &quot;technoethics&quot; was coined in 1977 by the philosopher Mario Bunge to describe the responsibilities of technologists and scientists to develop ethics as a branch of technology. Bunge argued that the current state of technological progress was guided by ungrounded practices based on limited empirical evidence and trial-and-error learning. He recognized that &quot;the technologist must be held not only technically but also morally responsible for whatever he designs or executes: not only should his artifacts be optimally efficient but, far from being harmful, they should be beneficial, and not only in the short run but also in the long term.&quot; He recognized a pressing need in society to create a new field called &#x27;technoethics&#x27; to discover rationally grounded rules for guiding science and technological progress.

With the spurt in technological advances came technological inquiry. Societal views of technology were changing; people were becoming more critical of the developments that were occurring and scholars were emphasizing the need to understand and to take a deeper look and study the innovations. Associations were uniting scholars from different disciplines to study the various aspects of technology. The main disciplines being philosophy, social sciences and science and technology studies (STS). Though many technologies were already focused on ethics, each technology discipline was separated from each other, despite the potential for the information to intertwine and reinforce itself. As technologies became increasingly developed in each discipline, their ethical implications paralleled their development, and became increasingly complex. Each branch eventually became united, under the term technoethics, so that all areas of technology could be studied and researched based on existing, real-world examples and a variety of knowledge, rather than just discipline-specific knowledge.

== Technology and ethics ==
===Ethics theories===
Technoethics involves the ethical aspects of technology within a society that is shaped by technology. This brings up a series of social and ethical questions regarding new technological advancements and new boundary crossing opportunities. Before moving forward and attempting to address any ethical questions and concerns, it is important to review the three major ethical theories to develop a perspective foundation:

*Utilitarianism (Bentham) is an ethical theory which attempts to maximize happiness and reduce suffering for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism focused on results and consequences rather than rules.
* Duty ethics (Kant) notes the obligations that one has to society and follows society&#x27;s universal rules. It focuses on the rightness of actions instead of the consequences, focusing on what an individual should do.
* Virtue ethics is another main perspective in normative ethics. It highlights the role and virtues that an individual&#x27;s character contains to be able to determine or evaluate ethical behaviour in society. By practicing honing honest and generous behavior, Aristotle, the philosopher of this theory believes that people will then make the right choice when faced with an ethical decision.
* Relationship ethics states that care and consideration are both derived from human communication. Therefore, ethical communication is the core substance to maintain healthy relationships.

===Historical framing of technology – four main periods===
# Greek civilization defined technology as techné. Techné is &quot;the set principles, or rational method, involved in the production of an object or the accomplishment of an end; the knowledge such as principles of method; art.&quot; This conceptualization of technology used during the early Greek and Roman period to denote the mechanical arts, construction, and other efforts to create, in Cicero&#x27;s words, a &quot;second nature&quot; within the natural world.
# Modern conceptualization of technology as invention materialized in the 17th century in Bacon&#x27;s futuristic vision of a perfect society governed by engineers and scientists in Saloman&#x27;s House, to raise the importance of technology in society.
# The German term &quot;Technik&quot; was used in the 19th-20th century. Technik is the totality of processes, machines, tools and systems employed in the practical arts and Engineering. Webber popularized it when it was used in broader fields. Mumford said it was underlying a civilization. Known as: before 1750: Eotechnic, in 1750-1890: Paleoethnic and in 1890: Neoethnic. Place it at the center of social life in close connection to social progress and societal change. Mumford says that a machine cannot be divorced from its larger social pattern, for it is the pattern that gives it meaning and purpose.
# Rapid advances in technology provoked a negative reaction from scholars who saw technology as a controlling force in society with the potential to destroy how people live (Technological Determinism). Heidegger warned people that technology was dangerous in that it exerted control over people through its mediating effects, thus limiting authenticity of experience in the world that defines life and gives life meaning. It is an intimate part of the human condition, deeply entrenched in all human history, society and mind.

===Significant technoethical developments in society===
Many advancements within the past decades have added to the field of technoethics. There are multiple concrete examples that have illustrated the need to consider ethical dilemmas in relation to technological innovations. Beginning in the 1940s influenced by the British eugenic movement, the Nazis conduct &quot;racial hygiene&quot; experiments causing widespread, global anti-eugenic sentiment. In the 1950s the first satellite Sputnik 1 orbited the Earth, the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant was the first nuclear power plant to be opened, the American nuclear tests take place. The 1960s brought about the first crewed Moon landing, ARPANET created which leads to the later creation of the Internet, first heart transplantation completed, and the Telstar communications satellite is launched. The 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s also brought multiple developments.

===Technological consciousness===
Technological consciousness is the relationship between humans and technology. Technology is seen as an integral component of human consciousness and development. Technology, consciousness and society are intertwined in a relational process of creation that is key to human evolution. Technology is rooted in the human mind, and is made manifest in the world in the form of new understandings and artifacts. The process of technological consciousness frames the inquiry into ethical responsibility concerning technology by grounding technology in human life.

The structure of technological consciousness is relational but also situational, organizational, aspectual and integrative. Technological consciousness situates new understandings by creating a context of time and space. As well, technological consciousness organizes disjointed sequences of experience under a sense of unity that allows for a continuity of experience. The aspectual component of technological consciousness recognizes that individuals can only be conscious of aspects of an experience, not the whole thing. For this reason, technology manifests itself in processes that can be shared with others. The integrative characteristics of technological consciousness are assimilation, substitution and conversation. Assimilation allows for unfamiliar experiences to be integrated with familiar ones. Substitution is a metaphorical process allowing for complex experiences to be codified and shared with others — for example, language. Conversation is the sense of an observer within an individual&#x27;s consciousness, providing stability and a standpoint from which to interact with the process.

===Misunderstandings of consciousness and technology===
According to Rocci Luppicini, the common misunderstandings about consciousness and technology are listed as follows. The first misunderstanding is that consciousness is only in the head when according to Luppicini, consciousness is not only in the head meaning that &quot;[c]onsciousness is responsible for the creation of new conscious relations wherever imagined, be it in the head, on the street or in the past.&quot; The second misunderstanding is technology is not a part of consciousness. Technology is a part of consciousness as &quot;the conceptualization of technology has gone through drastic changes.&quot; The third misunderstanding is that technology controls society and consciousness, by which Luppicini means &quot;that technology is rooted in consciousness as an integral part of mental life for everyone. This understanding will most likely alter how both patients and psychologists deal with the trials and tribunes of living with technology.&quot; The last misunderstanding is society controls technology and consciousness. &quot;…(other) accounts fail to acknowledge the complex relational nature of technology as an operation within mind and society. This realization shifts the focus on technology to its origins within the human mind as explained through the theory of technological consciousness.&quot;

*Consciousness (C) is only a part of the head: C is responsible for the creation of new conscious relations
*Technology (T) is not part of C: Humans cannot be separated from technology
*T controls society and C: Technology cannot control the mind
*Society controls T and C: Society fails to take in account the consideration of society shaping what technology gets developed?

== Types of technology ethics ==
Technology ethics are principles that can be used to govern technology including factors like risk management and individual rights. They are basically used to understand and resolve moral issues that have to do with the development and application of technology of different types.

There are many types of technology ethics:

* Access rights: access to empowering technology as a right
* Accountability: decisions made for who is responsible when considering success or harm in technological advancements
* Digital rights: protecting intellectual property rights and privacy rights
* Environment: how to produce technology that could harm the environment
* Existential risk: technologies that represent a threat to the global quality of life pertaining to extinction
* Freedom: technology that is used to control a society raising questions related to freedom and independence
* Health and safety: health and safety risks that are increased and imposed by technologies
* Human Enhancement: human genetic engineering and human-machine integration
* Human judgement: when can decisions be judged by automation and when do they acquire a reasonable human?
* Over-automation: when does automation decrease quality of life and start affecting society?
* Precaution principle: Who decides that developing this new technology is safe for the world?
* Privacy: protection of privacy rights
* Security: Is due diligence required to ensure information security?
* Self replicating technology: should self replicating be the norm?
* Technology transparency: clearly explaining how a technology works and what its intentions are
* Terms of service: ethics related to legal agreements

===Ethical challenges===
Ethical challenges arise in many different situations:

*Human knowledge processes 
*Workplace discrimination 
*Strained work-life balance in technologically enhanced work environments: Many people find that simply having the technology allowing one to do work while at home increases stress levels. In a recent study 70% of respondents said that since technology, work has crept into their personal lives.
*Digital divide: Inequalities in information access for parts of the population 
*Unequal opportunities for scientific and technological development
* Norris says access to information and knowledge resources within a knowledge society tend to favour the economically privileged who have greater access to technological tools needed to access information and knowledge resources disseminated online and the privatization of knowledge
* Inequality in terms of how scientific and technological knowledge is developed around the globe. Developing countries do not have the same opportunities as developed countries to invest in costly large-scale research and expensive research facilities and instrumentation
*Organizational responsibility and accountability issues 
*Intellectual property ownership issues
* Information overload: Information processing theory asserts that working memory that has a limited capacity and too much information can lead to cognitive overload resulting in loss of information from short-term memory
* Knowledge society is intertwined with changing technology requiring new skills of its workforce. Cutler says that there is the perception that older workers lack experience with new technology and that retaining programs may be less effective and more expensive for older workers. Cascio says that there is a growth of virtual organizations. Saetre &amp; Sornes say that it is a blurring of the traditional time and space boundaries has also led to many cases in the blurring of work and personal life
* Negative impacts of many scientific and technological innovations have on humans and the environment has led to some skepticism and resistance to increasing dependence on technology within the Knowledge Society. Doucet calls for city empowerment to have the courage and foresight to make decisions that are acceptable to its inhabitants rather that succumb to global consumer capitalism and the forces of international corporations on national and local governments
* Scientific and technological innovations that have transformed organizational life within a global economy have also supplanted human autonomy and control in work within a technologically oriented workplace
*The persuasive potential of technology raises the question of &quot;how sensitive ... designers and programmers [should] be to the ethics of the persuasive technology they design.&quot; Technoethics can be used to determine the level of ethical responsibility that should be associated with outcomes of the use of technology, whether intended or unintended
* Rapidly changing organizational life and the history of unethical business practices have given rise to public debates concerning organizational responsibility and trust. The advent of virtual organizations and increase in remote work has bolstered ethical problems by providing more opportunities for fraud and the production of misinformation. Concerted efforts are required to uphold ethical values in advancing new knowledge and tools within societal relations which do not exclude people or limit liberties of some people at the expense of others
* Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence seems to be the one of the most talked of challenges when it comes ethics. In order to avoid these ethical challenges some solutions have been established; first and for most it should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity. Secondly, it should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness. It should also not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families, or communities. It is also believed that all citizens should have the right to be educated on artificial intelligence in order to be able to understand it. Finally, the autonomous power to hurt, destroy, or deceive humans should never be vested in artificial intelligence.

===Current issues===

====Copyrights====
Digital copyrights are a complicated issue because there are multiple sides to the discussion. There are ethical considerations surrounding the artist, producer, and end user. Not to mention the relationships with other countries and the impact on the use of content housed in their countries. In Canada, national laws such as the Copyright Act and the history behind Bill C-32 are just the beginning of the government&#x27;s attempt to shape the &quot;wild west&quot; of Canadian Internet activities. The ethical considerations behind Internet activities such a peer-to-peer file sharing involve every layer of the discussion – the consumer, artist, producer, music/movie/software industry, national government, and international relations. Overall, technoethics forces the &quot;big picture&quot; approach to all discussions on technology in society. Although time-consuming, this &quot;big picture&quot; approach offers some level of reassurance when considering that any law put in place could drastically alter the way we interact with our technology and thus the direction of work and innovation in the country.

The use of copyrighted material to create new content is a hotly debated topic. The emergence of the musical &quot;mashup&quot; genre has compounded the issue of creative licensing. A moral conflict is created between those who believe that copyright protects any unauthorized use of content, and those who maintain that sampling and mash-ups are acceptable musical styles and, though they use portions of copyrighted material, the result is a new creative piece which is the property of the creator, and not of the original copyright holder. Whether or not the mashup genre should be allowed to use portions of copyrighted material to create new content is one which is currently under debate.

====Cybercriminality====

Cybercrime can consist of many subcategories and can be referred to as a big umbrella. Cyber theft such as online fraud, identity theft, and digital piracy can be classified as one sector. Another section of cybercrime can include cyber-violence which can be defined as online behavior that can be anywhere from hate speeches, harassment, cyberstalking, to behavior that leads to physical, psychological, or emotional assault against the well-being of an individual. Cyber obscenity is another section when child sexual exploitation materials are involved. Cyber trespass is when there is unauthorized computer system access. Cybercrime can encompass many other sections where technology and computers are used to assist and commit various forms of crimes.

For many years , new technologies took an important place in social, cultural, political, and economic life. Thanks to the democratization of informatics access and the network&#x27;s globalization, the number of exchanges and transaction is in perpetual progress.

In the article, &quot;The Dark Figure of Online Property Crime: Is Cyberspace Hiding a Crime Wave?&quot;, the authors analyze evidence that reveals cyber criminality rates are increasing as the typical street crimes gradually decrease. With the increase in cyber criminality, it is imperative to research more information on how to increase cyber security. The issue with increasing cyber security is that the more laws to protect people, the more citizens would feel threatened that their freedom is being compromised. One way to avoid making people feel threatened by all the security measures and protocols is by being as clear and straightforward as possible. Gregory Nojeim in his article &quot;Cybersecurity and Freedom on the Internet&quot; state, &quot;Transparency in the cybersecurity program will build the confidence and trust that is essential to industry and public support for cybersecurity measures.&quot; It is important to create ethical laws that protect privacy, innovation, and consumers&#x27; freedom.

Many people are exploiting the facilities and anonymity that modern technologies offer in order to commit multiple criminal activities. Cybercrime is one of the fastest growing areas of crime. The problem is that some laws that profess to protect people from those who would do wrong things via digital means also threaten to take away people&#x27;s freedom.

====Privacy vs. security: Full-body airport scanners====
Since the introduction of full body X-ray scanners to airports in 2007, many concerns over traveler privacy have arisen. Individuals are asked to step inside a rectangular machine that takes an alternate wavelength image of the person&#x27;s naked body for the purpose of detecting metal and non-metal objects being carried under the clothes of the traveler. This screening technology comes in two forms, millimeter wave technology (MM-wave technology) or backscatter X-rays (similar to x-rays used by dentists). Full-body scanners were introduced into airports to increase security and improve the quality of screening for objects such as weapons or explosives due to an increase of terrorist attacks involving airplanes occurring in the early 2000s.

Ethical concerns of both travelers and academic groups include fear of humiliation due to the disclosure of anatomic or medical details, exposure to a low level of radiation (in the case of backscatter X-ray technology), violation of modesty and personal privacy, clarity of operating procedures, the use of this technology to discriminate against groups, and potential misuse of this technology for reasons other than detecting concealed objects. Also people with religious beliefs that require them to remain physically covered (arms, legs, face etc.) at all times will be unable and morally opposed to stepping inside of this virtually intrusive scanning technology. The Centre for Society, Science and Citizenship have discussed their ethical concerns including the ones mentioned above and suggest recommendations for the use of this technology in their report titled &quot;Whole Body Imaging at airport checkpoints: the ethical and policy context&quot; (2010).

====Privacy and GPS technologies====
The discourse around GPS tracking devices and geolocation technologies and this contemporary technology&#x27;s ethical ramifications on privacy is growing as the technology becomes more prevalent in society. As discussed in the &quot;New York Times&quot;″s Sunday Review on September 22, 2012, the editorial focused on the ethical ramifications that imprisoned a drug offender because of the GPS technology in his cellphone was able to locate the criminal&#x27;s position. Now that most people carry on the person a cell, the authorities have the ability to constantly know the location of a large majority of citizens. The ethical discussion now can be framed from a legal perspective. As raised in the editorial, there are stark infractions that these geolocation devices on citizens&#x27; Fourth Amendment and their protection against unreasonable searches. This reach of this issue is not just limited to the United States but affects more democratic state that uphold similar citizens&#x27; rights and freedoms against unreasonable searches.

These geolocation technologies are not only affecting how citizens interact with their state but also how employees interact with their workplaces. As discussed in article by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, &quot;GPS and privacy&quot;, that a growing number of employers are installing geolocation technologies in &quot;company vehicles, equipment and cellphones&quot; (Hein, 2007). Both academia and unions are finding these new powers of employers to be indirect contradiction with civil liberties. This changing relationship between employee and employer because of the integration of GPS technology into popular society is demonstrating a larger ethical discussion on what are appropriate privacy levels. This discussion will only become more prevalent as the technology becomes more popular.

====Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)====
Genetically modified foods have become quite common in developed countries around the world, boasting greater yields, higher nutritional value, and greater resistance to pests, but there are still many ethical concerns regarding their use. Even commonplace genetically modified crops like corn raise questions of the ecological consequences of unintended cross pollination, potential horizontal gene transfer, and other unforeseen health concerns for humans and animals.

Trademarked organisms like the &quot;Glofish&quot; are a relatively new occurrence. These zebrafish, genetically modified to appear in several fluorescent colours and sold as pets in the United States, could have unforeseen effects on freshwater environments were they ever to breed in the wild.

Providing they receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), another new type of fish may be arriving soon. The &quot;AquAdvantage salmon&quot;, engineered to reach maturity within roughly 18 months (as opposed to three years in the wild), could help meet growing global demand. There are health and environmental concerns associated with the introduction any new GMO, but more importantly this scenario highlights the potential economic impact a new product may have. The FDA does perform an economic impact analysis to weigh, for example, the consequences these new genetically modified fish may have on the traditional salmon fishing industry against the long term gain of a cheaper, more plentiful source of salmon. These technoethical assessments, which regulatory organizations like the FDA are increasingly faced with worldwide, are vitally important in determining how GMOs—with all of their potential beneficial and harmful effects—will be handled moving forward.

====Pregnancy screening technology====
For over 40 years, newborn screening has been a triumph of the 20th century public health system. Through this technology, millions of parents are given the opportunity to screen for and test a number of disorders, sparing the death of their children or complications such as mental retardation. However, this technology is growing at a fast pace, disallowing researchers and practitioners from being able to fully understand how to treat diseases and provide families in need with the resources to cope.
A version of pre-natal testing, called tandem mass spectrometry, is a procedure that &quot;measures levels and patterns of numerous metabolites in a single drop of blood, which are then used to identify potential diseases. Using this same drop of blood, tandem mass spectrometry enables the detection of at least four times the number of disorders than was possible with previous technologies.&quot; This allows for a cost-effective and fast method of pre-natal testing.

However, critics of tandem mass spectrometry and technologies like it are concerned about the adverse consequences of expanding newborn screen technology and the lack of appropriate research and infrastructure needed to provide optimum medical services to patients. Further concerns include &quot;diagnostic odysseys&quot;, a situation in which the patient aimlessly continues to search for diagnoses where none exists.

Among other consequences, this technology raises the issue of whether individuals other than newborn will benefit from newborn screening practices. A reconceptualization of the purpose of this screening will have far reaching economic, health and legal impact. This discussion is only just beginning and requires informed citizenry to reach legal if not moral consensus on how far we as a society are comfortable with taking this technology.

====Citizen journalism====

Citizen journalism is a concept describing citizens who wish to act as a professional journalist or media person by &quot;collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information&quot; According to Jay Rosen, citizen journalists are &quot;the people formerly known as the audience,&quot; who &quot;were on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern, with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another—and who today are not in a situation like that at all. ... The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer, less fictional, more able, less predictable&quot;.
The internet has provided society with a modern and accessible public space. Due to the openness of the internet, there are discernible effects on the traditional profession of journalism. Although the concept of citizen journalism is a seasoned one, &quot;the presence of online citizen journalism content in the marketplace may add to the diversity of information that citizens have access to when making decisions related to the betterment of their community or their life&quot;. The emergence of online citizen journalism is fueled by the growing use of social media websites to share information about current events and issues locally, nationally and internationally.

The open and instantaneous nature of the internet affects the criteria of information quality on the web. A journalistic code of ethics is not instilled for those who are practicing citizen journalism. Journalists, whether professional or citizen, have needed to adapt to new priorities of current audiences: accessibility, quantity of information, quick delivery and aesthetic appeal. Thus, technology has affected the ethical code of the profession of journalism with the popular free and instant sharing qualities of the internet. Professional journalists have had to adapt to these new practices to ensure that truthful and quality reporting is being distributed. The concept can be seen as a great advancement in how society communicates freely and openly or can be seen as contributing to the decay of traditional journalistic practices and codes of ethics.

Other issues to consider:
*Privacy concerns: location services on cell devices which tell all users where a person is should they decide to turn on this feature, social media, online banking, new capabilities of cellular devices, Wi-fi, etc.
* New music technology: People see more electronic music today with the new technology able to create it, as well as more advanced recording technology

===Recent developments===
Despite the amassing body of scholarly work related to technoethics beginning in the 1970s, only recently has it become institutionalized and recognized as an important interdisciplinary research area and field of study. In 1998, the Epson Foundation founded the Instituto de Tecnoética in Spain under the direction of Josep Esquirol. This institute has actively promoted technoethical scholarship through awards, conferences, and publications. This helped encourage scholarly work for a largely European audience. The major driver for the emergence of technoethics can be attributed to the publication of major reference works available in English and circulated globally. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics&quot; included a section on technoethics which helped bring it into mainstream philosophy. This helped to raise further interest leading to the publication of the first reference volume in the English language dedicated to the emerging field of Technoethics. The two volume &quot;Handbook of Research on Technoethics&quot; explores the complex connections between ethics and the rise of new technologies (e.g., life-preserving technologies, stem cell research, cloning technologies, new forms of surveillance and anonymity, computer networks, Internet advancement, etc.) This recent major collection provides the first comprehensive examination of technoethics and its various branches from over 50 scholars around the globe. The emergence of technoethics can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in recent years such as technoscience and technocriticism.

====Technology and ethics in the music industry====

With all the developments we&#x27;ve had in technology it has created a lot advancement for the music industry both positive and negative. A main concern is piracy and illegal downloading; with all that is available through the internet a lot of music (TV shows and movies as well) have become easily accessible to download and upload for free. This does create new challenges for artist, producers, and copyright laws. The advances it has positively made for the industry is a whole new genre of music. Computers are being used to create electronic music, as well as synthesizers (computerized/electronic piano). This type of music is becoming rapidly more common and listened to. These advances have allowed the industry to try new things and make new explorations.

Because the internet is not controlled by a centralized power, users can maintain anonymity and find loopholes to avoid consequences for using peer-to-peer technology. The peer-to-peer network allows users to connect to a computer network and freely trade songs. Many companies, like Napster, have taken advantage of this because the protection of intellectual property is close to impossible on the internet. Digital and downloadable music has become a severe threat to major record companies. Associated digital music technologies have changed the power dynamics greatly for major record companies, music consumers, and the artists. Not only has this change in power dynamics provided more opportunities for independent music labels but also reduce costs for music.

The digital environment in the music industry is always evolving. &quot;The industry is beginning to work at adapting to the digital environment and downturns in a business performance like by online distribution and sales; harnessing visibility events for sales momentum; new capabilities for artist management in the digital age and by leveraging online communities to influence product development, among others&quot;. These new capabilities and new developments need strong intellectual property regulations to protect artists.

Technology is a pillar in the music industry; therefore, it is imperative to have strong technology ethics. Copyright protections and legislation help artists trademark their music and protect their intellectual property. Protecting intellectual property in the music industry becomes tricky when music firms are in the process of incorporating new technologies and methodologies, which forces firms to be innovative and update the industry standards.

====Technology and ethics during the coronavirus pandemic====
As of April 20, 2020 there has been over 43 contract tracing apps available globally. Countries are in the process of creating their own methods of digitally tracing coronavirus status (symptoms, confirmed infected, exposed). Apple and Google are working together on a shared solution that helps with contract tracing around the world. Since this is a global pandemic with no end in sight, the restriction of some fundamental rights and freedoms may be ethically justifiable. It may be unethical to not use these tracing solutions to slow the spread. The European Convention on Human Rights, the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the United Nations Siracusa Principles all indicate when it is ethical to restrict the rights of the population to prevent the spread of infectious disease. All three documents cite that the circumstances for restricting rights must be time-bound, meet standards of necessity, proportionality, and scientific validity. We must evaluate if the gravity of the situation justifies the potential negative impact, if the evidence shows that the technology will work, is timely, will be adopted by enough people and yields accurate data and insights, and evaluate if the technology will only be temporary. These three documents also provide guidelines on how to ethically develop and design technologies. The development and design guidelines are important for being effective and for security reasons.

The development of technology has enhanced the ability to obtain, track, and share data. Technology has been mobilized by governments around the world to combat the issue of COVID-19, which has brought attention to several issues surrounding ethics. Governments have implemented technologies such as smartphone metadata and Bluetooth applications to contact trace and notify the public of any important information. There are implications for privacy as technologies such as metadata have the capacity to track every movement of an individual. Due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, contact tracing and other tracking apps have been implemented globally in order to fight against the pandemic. Countries across the globe have developing various methods of digitally tracing corona virus such as outbreak origin, symptoms, confirmed positives, and those who are potentially exposed. Governments around the world combined available technology to identify individuals and surveillance technology while still having a low impact on individuals privacy. In 2020, the Australian government released a Bluetooth connected app that allows phones communicate through Bluetooth opposed to metadata. This allowed the app to connect with surrounding phones through Bluetooth opposed to metadata or GPS, which can have a bigger impact on individual privacy. The technology records individuals who have been in close proximity, by connecting through their phones, and recording the data for a certain time period before deleting itself. The app does not track individual&#x27;s locations but still can pinpoint if they have had close contact with those who were positive or exposed.

On the other hand, some countries such as South Korea utilized metadata technology to closely surveillance their citizens. Metadata can provide a detailed description of an individual&#x27;s movements by staying regularly in contact with the local cellular towers to maintain reception. In S. Korea, the government utilized individuals&#x27; metadata information to convey any public health message to the public. Anonymized information would be released to the public of the locations of individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. Similarly in Israel, the government approved emergency regulations that allowed authorities to utilize a database that tracks the movements of individuals that have tested positive for COVID-19.

The rise of surveillance technologies by the government to track individuals raises many questions of ethic concerns. As lockdowns and Covid protocols continue, the focus on protecting public health can severely conflict with individual autonomy, although it can be necessary to implement certain technologies and protocols.

Even though these three bodies of government can deem contact tracing ethical, all these contact tracing apps come with a price. They are collecting sensitive personal data including health data. This poses a threat to violate HIPAA and PII if not handled and processed correctly. Even if these apps are only used temporarily, they are storing permanent records of health, movements, and social interactions. Not only do we have to consider the ethical implications of your personal information being stored, but we must also look at the accessibility and digital literacy of the users. Not everyone has access to a smartphone or a cell phone. If we are developing smartphone applications, we will be missing a huge portion of coronavirus data.

While it may be necessary to utilize technology to slow the spread of coronavirus, the Government needs to design and deploy the technology in a way that does not breach the public trust. There is a fine line of saving lives and possibly harming the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.

===Future developments===
The future of technoethics is a promising, yet evolving field. The studies of e-technology in workplace environments are an evolving trend in technoethics. With the constant evolution of technology, and innovations coming out daily, technoethics is looking to be a rather promising guiding framework for the ethical assessments of new technologies. Some of the questions regarding technoethics and the workplace environment that have yet to be examined and treated are listed below:
* Are organizational counter measures not necessary because it invades employee privacy?
* Are surveillance cameras and computer monitoring devices invasive methods that can have ethical repercussions?
* Should organizations have the right and power to impose consequences?

====Artificial intelligence====
Artificial intelligence is a large range of technology that deals with building smart machines and data processing so tasks can be performed by machines that are normally completed by humans. AI may prove to be beneficial to human life, but it can also quickly become pervasive and dangerous. Changes in AI are difficult to anticipate and understand, such as employers spying on workers, facial recognition, deep fakes, etc. Along with AI, the algorithms used to implement the technology may prove to be biased which can have detrimental effects on individuals. For example, in facial recognition technology, the AI may be proven to be biased toward different ethnic and racial groups than others. These challenges have social, racial, ethical, and economic implications.

====Deepfakes====
Deepfake is a form of media in which one existing image or video is replaced or altered by someone else. Altering may include acting out fake content, false advertisement, hoaxes, and financial fraud. The technology of deepfakes may also use machine learning or artificial intelligence. Deepfakes propose an ethical dilemma due to how accessible they are as well as the implications on one&#x27;s integrity it may cause to viewers. Deepfakes reconsider the challenge of trustworthiness of the visual experience and can create negative consequences. Deepfakes contribute to the problem of &quot;fake news&quot; by enabling both the more widespread fabrication or manipulation of media that may be deliberately used for the purposes of disinformation. There are four categories of deepfakes: deepfake porn, deepfake political campaigns, deepfake for commercial use, and creative deepfakes. Deepfakes have many harmful effects such as deception, intimidation, and reputational harm. Deception causes views to synthesize a form of reality that did not exist before and may think of it as real footage. The contents of the footage may be detrimental depending on what it is. Detrimental information may include fraudulent voter information, candidate information, money fraud, etc. Intimidation may occur by targeting a certain audience with harmful threats to generate fear. An example of intimidation may be deepfake revenge pornography which also ties into reputational harm. 
Accessibility of deepfakes also raises ethical dilemmas as it can be accessed through apps like FakeApp, Zao, and Impressions. The accessibility to these applications may cause legal action. In 2018 the Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act was introduced to protect those who may be harmed by deepfakes. These crimes can result in prosecution for harassment or sentences to imprisonment. Although there can be legal actions for deepfakes, they do become increasingly difficult as many parties are involved in its development. The many parties for a deepfake such as the software developer, the application for amplification, the user of the software, etc. Due to these many different components, it may be difficult to prosecute individuals for deepfakes.

====United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)====
UNESCO – a specialized intergovernmental agency of the United Nations, focusing on promotion of education, culture social and natural sciences and communication and information.
In the future, the use of principles as expressed in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005) will also be analyzed to broaden the description of bioethical reasoning (Adell &amp; Luppicini, 2009).

==== User data ====
In a digital world, much of users&#x27; personal lives are stored on devices such as computers and smartphones, and we trust the companies we store our lives on to take care of our data. A topic of discussion regarding the ethics of technology is just exactly how much data these companies really need and what they are doing with it. Another major cause for concern is the security of our personal data and privacy, whether it is leaked intentionally or not.

User data has been one of the main topics regarding ethics as companies and government entities increasingly have access to billions of users&#x27; information. Why do companies need so much data regarding their users and are users aware that their data is being tacked? These questions have risen over the years over concerns of how much do companies actually know. Some websites and apps now ask users if they are allowed to track user activity across different apps with the option to decline. Most companies before did not ask or notify users that their app activity would be tracked. Companies over the years have been facing an increased number of data hacks where user&#x27;s data such as credit cards, social security, phone numbers, and addresses have been leaked. Users of social networks such as Snapchat and Facebook have been facing phone calls from scammers as recent data hacks released users&#x27; phone numbers. The most recent breach to affect Facebook leaked over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including 32 million users alone in the U.S. The type of information leaked included user phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and email addresses. Hackers and web scrapers have been selling Facebook user data on hacker forums, information for 1 million users can go for $5,000 on these forums.

Large companies share their users&#x27; data constantly. In 2018, the U.S, government cracked down on Facebook selling user data to other companies after declaring that it had made the data in question inaccessible. One such case was in a scandal regarding Cambridge Analytica, in which Facebook sold user data to the company without consent from the users whose data was being accessed. The data was then used for several political agendas, such as the Brexit vote and the U.S. Presidential Election of 2016. In an interview with CBS&#x27; 60 Minutes, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale described in detail how he used data taken from different social media websites to create ads that were both visually appealing to potential voters and targeted the issues that they felt strongest about.

Besides swinging political races, the theft of people&#x27;s data can result in serious consequences on an individual level. In some cases, hackers can breach websites or businesses that have identifying information about a person, such as their credit card number, cell phone number, and address, and upload it to the dark web for sale, if they decide not to use it for their own deviant purposes.

==== Drones ====
In the book &quot;Society and Technological Change, 8th Edition&quot;, by Rudi Volti, the author comments on unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as UAVs or drones. Once used primarily as military technology, these are becoming increasingly accessible tools to the common person for hobbies like photography. In the author&#x27;s belief, this can also cause concern for security and privacy, as these tools allow people with malicious intents easier access to spying.

Outside of public areas, drones are also able to be used for spying on people in private settings, even in their own homes. In an article by today.com, the author writes about people using drones and taking videos and photographs of people in their most private moments, even in the privacy of their own home.

From an ethical perspective, drones have a multitude of ethical issues many of which are determining current legal policy. Some areas include the ethical military usage of drones, private non-military use by hobbyists for photography or potential spying, drone usage in political campaigns as a way to spread campaign messages, drone usage in the private business sector as a means for delivery, and ethical usage of public/private airspace.

Pet Cloning

In 2020 pet cloning is to become something of interest for those who can afford it. For $25k - $50k anyone will be able to clone their house pet but there is no guarantee you will get the exact same pet that you once had. This may seem very appealing to certain animal-lovers, but what about all of those animals that already have no home?

There are a few different ethical questions here; the first being how is this fair to the animals that are suffering out in the wilderness with no home? The second being that cloning animals is not only for pets, but for all animals in general. Maybe people are concerned that people are going to clone animals for food purposes.Another question about animal cloning is it is good for the welfare of the animal or will the radiation and other procedural aspects cause the animals life to end earlier? These are just some of many concerns some people have with animal cloning.

==== Animal cloning ====
The ethical standpoint of animal cloning is a heavily debated topic in a plethora of different career paths. Some of these ethical concerns are the health and well being of the animals, long term side effects, obstetrical complications that occur during cloning, environmental impacts, use of clones in farming/repopulation of endangered species, and the use of clones for other research, specifically in the medical/pharmaceutical field. Many of these concerns are only more recently spoken about due to the advancement of cloning technology in the past decade since humanity&#x27;s first clone was only twenty-five years ago in 1996 resulting in the birth of a sheep known as Dolly.

== Facebook and Meta&#x27;s ethical concerns ==

Facebook, or rather Meta Platforms, Facebook&#x27;s parent company is currently one of the top social networking sites, throughout the early to late 2010s and into current times (2022). A variety of issues ranging from privacy concerns, the issue of who bears the responsibility of unhealthy social interactions and other unhealthy behaviors, to deliberate enabling of misinformation on the platform. Recent issues such as Facebook data leaks and circulation of fake news highlights the downside of social media when in the wrong hands. following are a few examples of various ethical concerns raised throughout the years in relation to Facebook.

=== &quot;Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook&quot; ===
A recent Forbes interview conducted on October 22, 2021, by Curt Steinhorst, a contributor for Forbes, with Michael Thate, an ethics teacher employed at Princeton University, asserts that in addition to the &quot;Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook&quot; ruling determining that Facebook had engaged in unethical antitrust behaviors with the acquisition of its competing social media platforms Instagram and WhatsApp, &quot;Facebook developed an algorithm to capture user attention and information into a platform that they knew promoted unhealthy behaviors.&quot; Firstly the unethical acquisition of smaller competing social media platforms restricts free-market practices and restricts users&#x27; choices in, at least in this case, what social media sites they choose to access. In addition to the antitrust, the promotion of unhealthy behaviors and lifestyles to increase user engagement on the platform is considered to be by Michael Thate to be an ethical concern, as users of the social media platform are given a choice between maintaining a healthy lifestyle and engaging in the social media platform that is designed to keep them on the site and actively engaged regardless of its impact on the wellbeing of the user.

=== Facebook&#x27;s algorithm ===
On October 4, 2021, CBS News interviewed Frances Haugen, a whistleblower and former employee of Facebook, who revealed Facebook was aware of various concerning ethical practices. &quot;The complaints say Facebook&#x27;s own research shows that it amplifies hate, misinformation, and political unrest—but the company hides what it knows. One complaint alleges that Facebook&#x27;s Instagram harms teenage girls.&quot; These various unethical practices were all employed to, yet again promote increased user engagement with the social media platform. Fences Haugen stated in the interview: &quot;The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.&quot; An article written on February 10, 2021, by Paige Cooper outlines how Facebook&#x27;s algorithm has changed over the years highlights the changes made by Facebook to prioritize the more emotional interactions on the site.

=== Facebook–Cambridge Analytica ===
Through the 2010s the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica in a conjoined effort with Facebook gathered information and personal data on upwards of 87 million nonconsenting users as stated by a &quot;New York Times&quot; article titled &quot;Cambridge Analytica and Facebook: The Scandal and the Fallout So Far&quot;. The illegally obtained data was then utilized in Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign to help develop personalized ads and campaign messages based on the data provided by Cambridge Analytica. An article was written by &quot;The Guardian&quot; on March 18, 2021, interviewing a Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie. In the interview, Wylie asserted that the data given to him was legally obtained and that he and various other academic analyses were also unaware of the nature to which the data used in the psychological profiles was obtained.

==Areas of technoethical inquiry==

===Biotech ethics===

Biotech ethics concerned with ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of biotechnologies in fields including medical research, health care, and industrial applications. Topics such as cloning ethics, e-health ethics, telemedicine ethics, genetics ethics, neuroethics, and sport and nutrition ethics fall into this category; examples of specific issues include the debates surrounding euthanasia and reproductive rights.

Telemedicine is a medical technology that has been used to advance clinical care with the use of video conferencing, text messaging, and applications. With the advantage of telemedicine, there are concerns about its pitfalls such as threats to patient privacy and HIPAA regulations. Cyberattacks in healthcare are a significant concern when implementing technology because there needs to be measures in place to keep patient privacy secure. One type of cyber attack is a medical device hijack also known as medjack where hackers can alter the functionality of implants, and expose patient medical history. When implementing technology, it is important to check for weaknesses that can cause vulnerability to hacking.

The use of technology in ethics also becomes a key factor when considering artificial intelligence. AI is not seen as a neutral tool, and policies have been set in place to ensure it is not misused under human bias. Although AI is a valuable tool in medicine, the current ethical policies are not up to standard to accommodate AI as it is a multi-disciplinary approach. AI in healthcare is not available to make clinical decisions; however, it can provide assistance in surgeries, imaging, etc.

===Technoethics and cognition===
This area of technoethical inquiry is concerned with technology&#x27;s relation to the human mind, artificial agents, and society. Topics of study that would fit into this category would be artificial morality and moral agents, moral outsourcing, technoethical systems and techno-addiction.
* An artificial agent describes any type of technology that is created to act as an agent, either of its own power or on behalf of another agent. An artificial agent may try to advance its own goals or those of another agent.

===Mass surveillance===
The ethics behind mass surveillance has become a highly discussed ethical topic in the twenty-first century, especially in the United States due to the tragedy of 9/11. Some areas of ethical concern involve privacy, discrimination, trust in government, infringement of government-granted rights/basic human rights, conflict of interest, stigmatization, and obtrusiveness. Many of these ethical topics in the timeframe between 2001 and 2021 have become the main topic of discussion in many recent laws all throughout the world. Shortly after 9/11 when the United States began to fear the idea that more terrorist attacks could occur on American soil. A law passed on October 26, 2001, known as the Patriot Act was one of the first larger Mass Surveillance laws passed in the United States. Years later Europe would begin to follow suit with their own set of mass surveillance laws after a string of terrorist attacks. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in France, the French government would move forward with passing the International Electronic Communications Law. The IEC would recognize the power of the French Directorate-General for External Security allowing them to collect, monitor, and intercept all communications sent or received on French territory. In 2016, the United Kingdom would pass the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, a law allowing the GCHQ to engage in acquisition, interception, and equipment interference of communications/systems sent by anyone on British territory. Finally, in 2016, another law like the Investigatory Powers Act was passed in Germany that was named the Communications Intelligence Gathering Act. This act allowed the German intelligence community to gather foreign nationals communications while they were in German territory. In 2021, Australia passed a law known as the Surveillance Legislation Amendment, which granted the Australian Federal Police and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission the right to modify or delete data of suspected offenders, Collect intelligence on criminal networks, and finally, forcefully break into a suspected offender&#x27;s online account. After these laws were passed all throughout Europe, and later on in Australia, a string of protests would begin to arise involving the laws, as citizens from each country would feel it infringed their privacy rights.

Two years after the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 was passed in the United Kingdom the English High Court would rule that the act would have to be rewritten. This ruling occurred due to the High Court finding the law to be incompatible with EU law since the law &quot;authorizes the UK government to issue retention notices with no prior independent checks, such as review by a court or other body, and for the purpose of investigating crime that is not &quot;serious crime&quot;; and (2) subsequent access to any retained data was similarly not subject to any independent authorization and not limited to the purpose of combating &quot;serious crime&quot;. The origin of this ruling comes from a human rights group known as Liberty who first began to battle the act shortly after it was enacted as they stated it violates the United Kingdom&#x27;s citizens the right to privacy. In 2020, Four years after Germany enacted the Communications Intelligence Gathering Act it would also make its way to court to be reviewed. Receiving heavy backlash from multiple members of the German public and Non-German citizens. Many of these complaints continued to dwell on the same issue of the privacy of both German and non-German citizens. After a two day trial, the high German court did rule that the law was unconstitutional and gave the German parliament until 2021 to make corrections to the Act.

Though, as of recent in the year 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The ethical atmosphere regarding public health surveillance began to take center stage due to its overall use during the height of the pandemic. The purpose of this mass surveillance was for data collection of the transmission of the COVID-19. Though, many individuals around the world cited they felt this form of surveillance infringed on their privacy and basic human rights. Another concern regarding this level of surveillance was the lack of government or institutional policy documents regarding how to address the ethical challenges around mass surveillance to track a pandemic transmission rate. The use of this mass surveillance was used on a far larger scale compared to some of the other acts passed in recent years, as this had a more global focus due to the want to bring the transmission of COVID-19 to a halt. For example, on March 16, 2020, the Israeli government allowed emergency regulations regarding mass location tracking of citizens to slow the spread of the disease. Singapore and Taiwan also did something similar, yet their method of mass surveillance was allowing their law-enforcement agencies to monitor quarantine orders.

===Technoethics and society===
This field is concerned with the uses of technology to ethically regulate aspects of a society. For example: digital property ethics, social theory, law, science, organizational ethics and global ethics.

Digital property rights or DPR refers to individual rights on information available online such as email accounts, online website accounts, posts, blogs, pictures, and other digital media. Digital property rights can be regulated and protected by making the digital property tamper-proof, by adding legal clause to the digital properties, and limiting the sharing of software code.

Social theory refers to how societies change and develop over time in terms of behavior and explanation of behaviors. Technology has a great impact on social change. As technology evolves and upgrades, human interaction goes along with the changes. &quot;Technological theory suggests that technology is an important factor for social change, and it would initiate changes in the arrangement of social relationships&quot;.

Organizational ethics refers to the code of conduct and the way an organization responds to stimulus. Techno ethics plays a role in organizational ethics because technology can be embedded and incorporated in many different aspects of ethical values.

===Technofeminism===
Technoethics has concerned itself with society as a general group and made no distinctions between the genders, but considers technological effects and influences on each gender individually. This is an important consideration as some technologies are created for use by a specific gender, including birth control, abortion, fertility treatments, and Viagra. Feminists have had a significant influence on the prominence and development of reproductive technologies. Technoethical inquiry must examine these technologies&#x27; effects on the intended gender while also considering their influence on the other gender. Another dimension of technofeminism concerns female involvement in technological development: women&#x27;s participation in the field of technology has broadened society&#x27;s understanding of how technology affects the female experience in society.

===Information and communication technoethics===
Information and communication technoethics is &quot;concerned with ethical issues and responsibilities arising when dealing with information and communication technology in the realm of communication.&quot; This field is related to internet ethics, rational and ethical decision making models, and information ethics. A major area of interest is the convergence of technologies: as technologies become more interdependent and provide people with multiple ways of accessing the same information, they transform society and create new ethical dilemmas. This is particularly evident in the realms of the internet. In recent years, users have had the unprecedented position of power in creating and disseminating news and other information globally via social networking; the concept of &quot;citizen journalism&quot; primarily relates to this. With developments in the media, has led to open media ethics as Ward writes, leading to citizen journalism.

In cases such as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami or the 2011 Arab Spring movements, citizen journalists were seen to have been significant sources of facts and information in relation to the events. These were re-broadcast by news outlets, and more importantly, re-circulated by and to other internet users. As Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin state in their book Remediation: Understanding New Media (1999): &quot;The liveness of the Web is a refashioned version of the liveness of broadcast television&quot; However, it is commonly political events (such as &#x27;Occupy&#x27; movements or the Iran Elections of 2009) that tend to raise ethical questions and concerns. In the latter example, there had been efforts made by the Iranian government in censoring and prohibiting the spread of internal happenings to the outside by its citizen journalists. This occurrence questioned the importance of the spread of crucial information regarding the issue, and the source from which it came from (citizen journalists, government authorities, etc.). This goes to prove how the internet &quot;enables new forms of human action and expression [but] at the same time it disables [it]&quot; Information and Communication Technoethics also identifies ways to develop ethical frameworks of research structures in order to capture the essence of new technologies.

===Educational and professional technoethics===

Technoethical inquiry in the field of education examines how technology impacts the roles and values of education in society. This field considers changes in student values and behavior related to technology, including access to inappropriate material in schools, online plagiarism using material copied directly from the internet, or purchasing papers from online resources and passing them off as the student&#x27;s own work. Educational technoethics also examines the digital divide that exists between educational institutions in developed and developing countries or between unequally-funded institutions within the same country: for instance, some schools offer students access to online material, while others do not. Professional technoethics focuses on the issue of ethical responsibility for those who work with technology within a professional setting, including engineers, medical professionals, and so on. Efforts have been made to delineate ethical principles in professions such as computer programming (see programming ethics).

===Environmental and engineering technoethics===

Environmental technoethics originate from the 1960s and 1970s&#x27; interest in environment and nature. The field focuses on the human use of technologies that may impact the environment; areas of concern include transport, mining, and sanitation. Engineering technoethics emerged in the late 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution triggered a demand for expertise in engineering and a need to improve engineering standards, societies began to develop codes of professional ethics and associations to enforce these codes. Ethical inquiry into engineering examines the &quot;responsibilities of engineers combining insights from both philosophy and the social sciences.&quot;

===Technoethical assessment and design===

A technoethical assessment (TEA) is an interdisciplinary, systems-based approach to assessing ethical dilemmas related to technology. TEAs aim to guide actions related to technology in an ethical direction by advancing knowledge of technologies and their effects; successful TEAs thus produce a shared understanding of knowledge, values, priorities, and other ethical aspects associated with technology. TEAs involve five key steps:

# Evaluate the intended ends and possible side effects of the technology in order to discern its overall value (interest).
# Compare the means and intended ends in terms of technical and non-technical (moral and social) aspects.
# Reject those actions where the output (overall value) does not balance the input in terms of efficiency and fairness.
# Consider perspectives from all stakeholder groups.
# Examine technological relations at a variety of levels (e.g. biological, physical, psychological, social, and environmental).

Technoethical design (TED) refers to the process of designing technologies in an ethical manner, involving stakeholders in participatory design efforts, revealing hidden or tacit technological relations, and investigating what technologies make possible and how people will use them. TED involves the following four steps:

# Ensure that the components and relations within the technological system are explicitly understood by those in the design context.
# Perform a TEA to identify relevant technical knowledge.
# Optimize the technological system in order to meet stakeholders&#x27; and affected individuals&#x27; needs and interests.
# Consult with representatives of stakeholder and affected groups in order to establish consensus on key design issues.

Both TEA and TED rely on systems theory, a perspective that conceptualizes society in terms of events and occurrences resulting from investigating system operations. Systems theory assumes that complex ideas can be studied as systems with common designs and properties which can be further explained using systems methodology. The field of technoethics regards technologies as self-producing systems that draw upon external resources and maintain themselves through knowledge creation; these systems, of which humans are a part, are constantly in flux as relations between technology, nature, and society change. TEA attempts to elicit the knowledge, goals, inputs, and outputs that comprise technological systems. Similarly, TED enables designers to recognize technology&#x27;s complexity and power, to include facts and values in their designs, and to contextualize technology in terms of what it makes possible and what makes it possible.

==Organizational technoethics==
Recent advances in technology and their ability to transmit vast amounts of information in a short amount of time has changed the way information is being shared amongst co-workers and managers throughout organizations across the globe. Starting in the 1980s with information and communications technologies (ICTs), organizations have seen an increase in the amount of technology that they rely on to communicate within and outside of the workplace. However, these implementations of technology in the workplace create various ethical concerns and in turn a need for further analysis of technology in organizations. As a result of this growing trend, a subsection of technoethics known as organizational technoethics has emerged to address these issues.

==Key scholarly contributions==
Key scholarly contributions linking ethics, technology, and society can be found in a number of seminal works:
* &quot;The Imperative of Responsibility: In Search of Ethics for the Technological Age&quot; (Hans Jonas, 1979).
*&quot; On Technology, Medicine and Ethics&quot; (Hans Jonas, 1985).
*&quot; The Real World of Technology &quot;(Franklin, 1990).
* &quot;Thinking Ethics in Technology: Hennebach Lectures and Papers, 1995-1996&quot; (Mitcham, 1997).
* &quot;Technology and the Good Life&quot; (Higgs, Light &amp; Strong, 2000).
* &quot;Readings in the Philosophy of Technology&quot; (Kaplan, 2004).
* &quot;Ethics and technology: Ethical issues in an age of information and communication technology&quot; (Tavani, 2004).

This resulting scholarly attention to ethical issues arising from technological transformations of work and life has helped given rise to a number of key areas (or branches) of technoethical inquiry under various research programs (i.e., computer ethics, engineering ethics, environmental technoethics, biotech ethics, nanoethics, educational technoethics, information and communication ethics, media ethics, and Internet ethics).

<text>Maclura tinctoria, known as old fustic and dyer&#x27;s mulberry, is a medium to large tree of the Neotropics, from Mexico to Argentina. It produces a yellow dye called fustic primarily known for coloring khaki fabric for U.S. military apparel during World War I. This dye contains the flavonoid morin. It is dioecious, so both male and female plants are needed to set seed.

The leaves can be used to feed silk worms.

Old fustic is not to be confused with young fustic (&quot;Rhus cotinus&quot;) from southern Europe and Asia, which provides a more fugitive colour.

==Dyeing==
Fustic is a bright yellow dye that is very color-fast when used with mordants. It is frequently combined with other dyestuffs and various mordants to produce a range of yellow and greenish colors: 
* With woad or indigo: bright or Saxon greens
* With bichromate of potash: old gold
* With logwood and bichromate of potash: greenish yellows
* With copper sulfate: olive greens
* With ferrous sulfate: dark greens

<text>Jan Harold Brunvand (born March 23, 1933) is an American retired folklorist, researcher, writer, public speaker, and professor emeritus of English at the University of Utah.

Brunvand is best known for popularizing the concept of the urban legend, a form of modern folklore or story telling. Urban legends are &quot;too good to be true&quot; stories that travel by word of mouth, by print, or by the internet and are attributed to an FOAF: friend of a friend. &quot;Urban legends,&quot; Brunvand says, &quot;have a persistent hold on the imagination because they have an element of suspense or humor, they are plausible and they have a moral.&quot;

Though criticized for the &quot;popular&quot; rather than &quot;academic&quot; orientation of his books, &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot; and others, Brunvand felt that it was a &quot;natural and worthwhile part of his job as a folklorist to communicate the results of his research to the public.&quot;

For his lifetime dedication to the field of folklore, which included radio and television appearances, a syndicated newspaper column, and over 100 publications (articles, books, notes and reviews), Brunvand is considered to be &quot;the legend scholar with the greatest influence on twentieth-century media.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Brunvand was born on March 23, 1933, in Cadillac, Michigan, to Norwegian immigrants Harold N. Brunvand and Ruth Brunvand. He and his two siblings, Tor and Richard, were brought up in Lansing, Michigan. Brunvand graduated from J. W. Sexton High School in Lansing in 1951.

From high school, Brunvand attended Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, where, in 1955, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. While at Michigan State, he attended a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant upon graduation. Brunvand went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in English from the same university in 1957. He briefly served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth and was discharged with the rank of 1st Lieutenant.

==Academic career==
While attending Michigan State, Brunvand met Richard Dorson, a folklorist and professor, who became a mentor. Brunvand took an undergraduate American Folklore course Dorson offered in the fall quarter of 1954 and, in subsequent semesters, completed two of Dorson&#x27;s graduate courses in folklore as a special enrollee. The work Brunvand and other classmates did for Dorson&#x27;s classes included &quot;preparing a large and well organized personal collection of folklore garnered from oral tradition and furnished with informant data and background comments.&quot; These papers would later serve as the beginnings of a large archive of folklore housed at Indiana University.

On June 10, 1956, Brunvand married Judith Darlene Ast, also a student at Michigan State University. Four days later, the couple left for Oslo, Norway, where Brunvand attended the University of Oslo on a Fulbright scholarship. He spent the year studying folklore. He started publishing in academic publications during this period, notably a paper on Norwegian-American folklore in the archives of Indiana University and one about the Norwegian folk hero Askeladden.
In 1957, Brunvand returned to the United States as a graduate student at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. He switched majors, from English to folklore, and took a series of classes offered through the university&#x27;s summer institute. He worked as an archivist in the Indiana University Folklore Archives from September 1958 to June 1960. During this time, he met Archer Taylor, who, as a visiting professor, taught a course on proverbs and riddles. This course, according to Brunvand, &quot;changed his life.&quot; Proverbs became one of Brunvand&#x27;s favorite topics to study and discuss. In 1961, Brunvand&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases from Books Published by Indiana Authors Before 1890&quot; was published as Number 15 of the Indiana University&#x27;s Folklore Series. Of the book, Brunvand says two things: &quot;I&#x27;ve become better at choosing titles since then,&quot; and &quot;The price was $3.00, and it was worth every penny of it.

In 1961, Brunvand also received a Ph.D. in folklore from Indiana University. His dissertation, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew: A Comparative Study of Oral and Literary Versions (Aarne-Thompson type 901),&quot; later published by Routledge in 1991, highlighted his interest in the structure, morphology and typology of the folktale.

Brunvand taught at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, from 1961 to 1965. He served as associate editor of the &quot;Journal of American Folklore&quot; from 1963 to 1967.

In 1965, Brunvand taught for a year at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, Illinois, focusing on folktales, folklore and literature, before moving with his wife and four children to the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, where he remained a professor until his retirement in 1996.

By 1967, Brunvand was a member of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association. He had also served as Book Review Editor for the Journal of American Folklore, which he resigned after receiving a Fulbright Scholarship research grant in 1970 to study folklore in Romania. He also won a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Humanities (Folklore and Popular Culture) that same year. Throughout the next decade, Brunvand focused his research on Romanian folklore, with a particular interest in Romanian house decoration. He returned to Romania in 1973-74 and again in 1981, receiving grants from the International Research &amp; Exchanges Board (IREX) to continue his studies. His research would later be published in a single volume collection titled &quot;Casa Frumoasa: The House Beautiful in Rural Romania,&quot; published by East European Monographs in 2003.

In 1968, &quot;The Study of American Folklore: An Introduction&quot; was published by W.W. Norton and Company. Brunvand received an Honorable Mention for this book in a 1969 Chicago Folklore Prize competition. The Chicago Folklore Prize is &quot;supported by an endowment established by the International Folklore Association and is awarded annually by the University of Chicago for an important contribution to the study of folklore.&quot;

Brunvand&#x27;s &quot;A Guide for Collectors of Folklore in Utah&quot; was published by Utah Publications in the American West in 1971.

In the years 1973 to 1976, Brunvand, again, took on the role of associate editor for the Journal of American Folklore. He was named Folklore Fellow by the American Folklore Society in 1974 and was elected president of the organization in 1985.

From 1977 to 1980, Brunvand served as editor of the Journal of American Folklore, with the goal of making the journal more readable and useful to its major audience, American folklorists. He widened the scope of the journal by including articles written by those outside folklore, but whose work was &quot;relevant to that being done by professional folklorists.&quot; He wanted to emphasize folklore and literature, folklore and history, folklife, festival and modern folklore.

In 1976, Brunvand&#x27;s book &quot;Folklore: A Study and Research Guide&quot; was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. The book, intended for undergraduate folklore students, was a research tool with a bibliographic guide and tips for researching term papers.

Brunvand edited two other textbooks: &quot;Readings in American Folklore&quot;, published by W.W. Norton and Company in 1979, &quot;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia&quot;, published by Garland in 1996.

==&quot;Mr. Urban Legend&quot;==
While teaching folklore at the University of Utah, Brunvand noticed a disconnect with his students and their views toward folklore. &quot;They always seemed to think that folklore belonged to somebody else, usually in the past, that was something quaint and outdated.&quot; He began asking his students to think about and discuss stories from their own lives. These stories helped form the basis of a collection which Brunvand later included in several popular books on the topic of urban legends.
In 1981, Brunvand&#x27;s first book devoted to urban legends was published. &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings&quot; helped to popularize the topic for a student audience. Urban legends, Brunvand explains, are &quot;kissing cousins of myths, fairy tales and rumors. Legends differ from rumors because the legends are stories, with a plot. And unlike myths and fairy tales, they are supposed to be current and true, events rooted in everyday reality that at least could happen.&quot; Urban legends reflect modern-day societal concerns, hopes and fears, but are &quot;weird whoppers we tell one another, believing them to be factual.&quot;

Over the next two decades, Brunvand added to the collection with &quot;new&quot; urban legends: &quot;The Choking Doberman and Other &quot;New&quot; Urban Legends&quot;, &quot;The Big Book of Urban Legends&quot; (which was formatted as a comic book), &quot;The Mexican Pet: More &quot;New&quot; Urban Legends&quot;, &quot;Curses! Broiled Again!&quot;, &quot;The Baby Train: And Other Lusty Urban Legends&quot;, &quot;Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends&quot;, and &quot;The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story!&quot;. He made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and, in 1987, began a twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column called &quot;Urban Legends.&quot; He participated in countless radio talk shows and dozens of press interviews, educating people about this pass-along folk narrative that, typically involves people misunderstanding or making false assumptions about a story they heard. They forget details and fill in the gaps by inventing what they are missing to make sense of the story. Though criticized for the popular orientation of his books, Brunvand was dedicated to publicizing the field of folklore, exploring the roots of the stories, where possible, and, in some cases debunking them. &quot;Folklorists fill different educational roles,&quot; Brunvand told members of The Missouri Folklore Society in 2003, &quot;sometimes in classrooms, but often in a more public forum. I believe that the public and media image of what a folklorist does is in fact part of what we &quot;should&quot; be doing, whether we were trained specifically for it or not, whether we work in academe or not, and whether we like it or not.&quot;

Brunvand and his books became so popular, that, when Richard Wolkomir dubbed him &quot;Mr. Urban Legend&quot; in an article for the Smithsonian, the title was later added to book jackets and other publicity. In an article for &quot;Western Folklore&quot;, Brunvand mentioned a notice he found on a computer newsgroup dated 1 March 1989, presumably an insider&#x27;s joke: &quot;I think Jan Harold Brunvand, alleged author of &quot;The Choking Doberman&quot;, is an urban legend. Has anybody ever actually seen this guy?&quot; A &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; publication, Mediagate, parodied urban legend books with this fake publisher&#x27;s notice: &quot;Bookman Publishing&#x27;s Catalog for Fall &#x27;87: &quot;The Embarrassing Fart and More New Urban Legends&quot; by Jan Harold Brunvand. Yet another set of rumors, tall tales, and fourth-hand hearsay compiled by the author of &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker.&quot; Includes more recent urban legends such as the Senile President, the Adulterous Evangelist, and the Smelly Gym Sock in the Big Mac. 233 pages hardbound. $34.95 (Harvard 1988: 229).&quot;

==Post-retirement career==
Brunvand retired from the University of Utah in 1996, but continued doing some research and writing as professor emeritus of English.

He frequently writes for publications dedicated to skiing, vintage automobiles and fly fishing. Once in a while, Brunvand&#x27;s hobbies and academic interests intersect, notably with an article in The American Fly Fisher debunking a fake quotation by Thoreau. He writes a series of columns on Seniors Skiing.com.

Brunvand was a guest on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; in September 1999. He spoke to Noah Adams about his book &quot;Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends&quot;.

His &quot;Encyclopedia of Urban Legends&quot;, illustrated by Randy Hickman, was published by ABC-CLIO in 2001.

He gave the keynote address at the 2003 meeting of the Missouri Folklore Society. He was a speaker at the World Skeptics Congress in Italy in 2004. His is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, formerly known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. In 2003 Brunvand was awarded CSICOP&#x27;s &quot;Distinguished Skeptic&quot; Award.

Brunvand&#x27;s book &quot;Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid: The Book of Scary Urban Legends&quot; was published in 2004 by W.W. Norton and Company.

==Personal==
In 2003, Brunvand entered the &quot;Trout Bum Tournament&quot; sponsored by Fly Rod and Reel. He participated in the Solo-Angler category. Known during the tournament as the &quot;Vanishing Fly Fisher&quot; (a nod to his book, &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot;), Brunvand spent 10 days alone fishing some of his favorite spots in Utah: Mammoth Creek, Gooseberry Creek, Price River, and Antimony River (where he &quot;fell twice and bashed his knee, though the injury wasn&#x27;t anything a cold towel and a cold beer wouldn&#x27;t fix&quot;). &quot;Day 10,&quot; Jim Reilly wrote in an article describing the competition,&quot; was the last we heard from Jan. We assume he made it home, but maybe he...vanished.&quot;

His favorite hobbies are fly fishing and skiing. He and his wife, Judith, continue to reside in Salt Lake City, Utah.

==Popular books about urban legends==

===&quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot;===

&quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings&quot; is a book intended to introduce the idea of urban legends to the general public. Included in the book are such chilling and humorous stories as &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker,&quot; &quot;The Economical Car,&quot; &quot;The Ghost Airliner,&quot; The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo,&quot; &quot;The Solid Cement Cadillac,&quot; and &quot;The Killer in the Back Seat.&quot; Brunvand&#x27;s approach, according to reviewer Janet L. Langlois, &quot;sensitizes the reader in a highly readable and effective way to both the dynamic narrative process in an urban context and the discipline of folklore and folklife studies.&quot; Some of these stories previously appeared in an article Brunvand wrote for the June 1980 issue of Psychology Today. As with &quot;Heard About the Solid Cement Cadillac or the Nude in the Camper?,&quot; Brunvand categorizes the different legends included in &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot; into classic urban legend types. For each legend type, Brunvand offers samples that show variations on the legends themselves, historical evidence of how the legend may have originated (often with European or East Asian roots), and an explanation of what the legend might mean in an urban or modern context.

Although recognized by critics for its usefulness as an introductory volume and reference point for expanding the field of folklore, reviewers cautioned that &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot; lacked the depth necessary for people actively researching urban legends. Janet L. Langlois, for example, wondered what criteria Brunvand used in selecting stories for the book, as well as what made the legends American, urban and modern. Reviewer Gary Alan Fine wrote, &quot;The paperback edition makes an excellent supplementary reading for introductory folklore students. It&#x27;s all good fun, and Brunvand, folklore&#x27;s Carl Sagan, should thrive and prosper, letting the all-purpose intelligentsia know that folklore is just as much fun as interplanetary travel and not nearly as expensive.&quot; To this, Brunvand countered: &quot;I really won&#x27;t think I have arrived until they refer to Carl Sagan as &#x27;The Jan Brunvand of astronomy.&#x27;&quot;

===&quot;The Choking Doberman&quot;===
Patricia T. O&#x27;Connor, writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described &quot;The Choking Doberman and Other &quot;New&quot; Urban Legends&quot; as &quot;a collection of &#x27;urban legends,&#x27; fictitious narratives that are passed from person to person in the guise of true stories and sometimes persist until they reach the status of folklore.&quot; These stories are bizarre but believable and often attributed to a friend of a friend (FOAF). Like in his book, &quot;The Vanishing Hitchhiker&quot;, Brunvand provided the reader with a survey of urban legends, stories such as &quot;The Choking Doberman,&quot; &quot;The Poison Dress,&quot; and &quot;The Death of Little Mikey.&quot; Each story, with its accompanying variations, are categorized into themes and motifs: victimized women and children, food and beverage contamination, fearful encounters, sexual embarrassment, and humorous retribution.

Though Robert D. Bethke called &quot;The Choking Doberman&quot; &quot;the kind of work one immediately wants to share with friends,&quot; he also criticized the work for the &quot;rhetorical devises&quot; Brunvand used &quot;apparently to suit the popular market.&quot; Critics also pointed out that Brunvand&#x27;s urban legend books raise a question about race and stereotypes that, to some, are left unaddressed. Bethke wrote &quot;We are told that the stories are projective of American popular culture, but precisely what racial segment of the culture participates in the currency of such stories? Specifically, we are dealing with a phenomenon like the ethnic joke, examples of which are told by target groups, or is the urban legend essentially a mainstream occurrence? I don&#x27;t think the final word has been written yet on the genre, but Jan Brunvand has made admirable strides toward that end.&quot;

===&quot;The Mexican Pet: &quot;New&quot; Urban Legends&quot;===
&quot;The Mexican Pet: &quot;New&quot; Urban Legends&quot; is Brunvand&#x27;s third book in a series of books about urban legends meant to appeal to a general audience. This time, Brunvand includes stories collected from colleagues, students, professional newscasters and appeals through his own publications, lectures and media appearances. He organized the book in thematic categories: animal stories, automobiles, horrors, contaminations, sex and scandal, crime, and products, professionals and personalities. There are new versions of earlier legends, newly obtained pieces and leftovers from his files. Among the stories included in the book are: &quot;The Mexican Pet,&quot; &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids&#x27; death certificates,&quot; &quot;The Green Stamps.&quot; Many of the stories have been disseminated through print and broadcast media.

Brunvand wrote in a 2003 article, &quot;Nowadays it would be naive to ask for mere press releases and print articles when most people turn to websites and on-line databases for information.&quot; He recognized that urban legend reference sites, like Snopes.com provide readers with far more timely examples and current information than he could keep up with in his books.

==Academic books on American folklore==

===&quot;The Study of American Folklore. An Introduction&quot;===
&quot;The Study of American Folklore. An Introduction&quot; is a book intended for students of folklore with a particular emphasis on American Folklore as transmitted in the English language. For the purposes of this book, Brunvand defines folklore as &quot;those materials in culture that circulate traditionally among members of any group in different versions, whether in oral form or by means of customary example.&quot; The book is divided into three main categories: verbal (dialect and speech habits, proverbs, riddles, tales, rhymes, folk-songs, ballads), partly verbal (superstitions, customs, dances, plays), and non-verbal (gestures, music, handcrafts, folk architecture, food). Within the text, Brunvand provided for the reader information on data collecting methods, a general assessment of folklore material, bibliographic essays, and extensive lists of books and articles. To some, like reviewer Elliott Oring, the classification system used by Brunvand made &quot;The Study of American Folklore&quot; more of an &quot;index&quot; of American folklore rather than a &quot;study&quot; of it. Reviewer Kenneth Laine Ketner criticized the book for its failure to make explicit the background theory used to evaluate the works and classification system included in the book, contradictions in detail and narrative, its authoritarian tone, and its charismatic or arbitrary approach to knowledge with serious ethnocentric biases. Peter Tokofsky, in his article &quot;Introducing Folklore: A Review Essay&quot;, suggested that &quot;the longevity and, presumably, continuing strong sales of the Brunvand text seems to confirm that introducing folklore by way of genres remains an effective and, for many, a preferred teaching tool even if it does not reflect the most current theoretical perspectives.&quot;

===&quot;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia&quot;===
&quot;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia&quot; is an illustrated volume that contains within its pages more than 500 articles covering American and Canadian folklore and folklife. Subject areas include holidays, festivals, rituals to crafts, music, dance and occupations. The book provides short bibliographies and cross-references for further research.

<text>Birch Evans Bayh Jr. (; January 22, 1928 – March 14, 2019) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a member of United States Senate from 1963 to 1981. He was first elected to office in 1954, when he won election to the Indiana House of Representatives; in 1958, he was elected Speaker, the youngest person to hold that office in the state&#x27;s history. In 1962, he ran for the U.S. Senate, narrowly defeating incumbent Republican Homer E. Capehart. Shortly after entering the Senate, he became Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, and in that role authored two constitutional amendments: the Twenty-fifth—which establishes procedures for an orderly transition of power in the case of the death, disability, or resignation of the President of the United States—and the Twenty-sixth, which lowered the voting age to 18 throughout the United States. He is the first person since James Madison and only non–Founding Father to have authored more than one constitutional amendment. Bayh also led unsuccessful efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and eliminate the United States Electoral College.

Bayh authored Title IX of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which bans sexism in higher education institutions that receive federal funding. He also authored the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, and co-authored the Bayh–Dole Act, which deals with intellectual property that arises from federal-government-funded research. Bayh voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court of the United States. He led the Senate opposition to the nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, two of Richard Nixon&#x27;s unsuccessful Supreme Court nominees. Bayh intended to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, but declined to run after his wife was diagnosed with cancer. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, but dropped out of the campaign after disappointing finishes in the first set of primaries and caucuses.

Bayh won re-election in 1968 and 1974, but lost his 1980 bid for a fourth term to Dan Quayle. After leaving the Senate, he remained active in the political and legal world. His son, Evan Bayh, served as the 46th Governor of Indiana and held his father&#x27;s former U.S. Senate seat from 1999 to 2011.

== Early life ==
=== Youth and education ===
Bayh was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, the son of Leah Ward (née Hollingsworth), a teacher, and Birch Bayh, an intercollegiate coach and athletic director. His ancestry included ancestors who were German, English, Scotch-Irish, and Scottish. Bayh spent summers on his grandparents&#x27; farm in Shirkieville, Indiana, where he later lived. As a student at New Goshen (Fayette Township) High School, young Birch took part in speaking contests, played baseball and basketball, and won the Indiana 4-H Tomato Championship.

From 1946 to 1948, Bayh served as a Military Police Corps with the United States Army in occupied Germany following World War II. He excelled in sports, competing as a Golden Gloves boxer in college and taking part in two Major League Baseball tryouts. Bayh graduated from the Purdue University School of Agriculture in 1951, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega social fraternity and senior class president. In 1951, he won Alpha Tau Omega&#x27;s highest individual collegiate award, the Thomas Arkle Clark Award. He married Marvella Hern in August 1952, and took courses at Indiana State University in Terre Haute for two years while also running the family farm.

=== Indiana legislature and 1962 U.S. Senate campaign ===

Bayh&#x27;s political career began at age 26 with his election to the Indiana House of Representatives in 1954, where he served two years as Speaker and four years as Democratic Floor Leader. At the time, Bayh was the youngest Speaker in Indiana state history. While he served in the legislature, Bayh studied law at Indiana University&#x27;s School of Law, received his LL.B. in 1960, and was admitted to the Indiana Bar in 1961.

At age 34, Bayh was elected to the United States Senate in the 1962 midterm elections, defeating 18-year incumbent Homer E. Capehart. Capehart was outspoken on the threat of Soviet nuclear missiles being placed in Cuba, and was buoyed by the Cuban Missile Crisis of that October. Bayh&#x27;s disadvantage was dramatized in the opening scene of the 2000 film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, as President John F. Kennedy rattles a newspaper and asks an aide, &quot;You see this goddamn Capehart stuff?&quot; and the aide responds, &quot;Bayh&#x27;s going to lose&quot;.

Bayh&#x27;s success was attributed to a vigorous campaign of 300 speeches between Labor Day and the election, and a catchy campaign jingle that taught voters the correct pronunciation of his last name:

For more than four decades — throughout his entire career in politics — Bayh continued to manage the growing of corn and soybeans on his family farm.

== United States Senator ==


=== Drafter of constitutional amendments ===
As a freshman senator, Bayh was assigned to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. While his service on the Public Works Committee allowed him to assist Hoosier with various problems, Bayh&#x27;s work on the subcommittees of the Judiciary Committee had the most lasting effect.

Bayh was serving on the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution in August 1963 when its chairman, Estes Kefauver, died of a heart attack. Judiciary Committee Chairman James Eastland planned to terminate the subcommittee to save money, but Bayh offered to serve as chairman and pay for its staff out of his Senate office budget. Thus, Bayh assumed the Constitutional Amendments Subcommittee chairmanship less than a year into his first term. As chairman, Bayh was the principal architect of two constitutional amendments.

==== Presidential disability and succession ====
After President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s health issues in the 1950s, Congress began studying the Constitution&#x27;s dangerously weak and vague provisions for presidential disability and vice presidential succession. The 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy brought a new urgency to the matter. Bayh introduced an amendment on December 12, 1963, which was studied and then re-introduced and passed in 1965 with Emanuel Celler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The resulting Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1967, created a process for a peaceful transition of power in the case of death, disability, or resignation of the President, and a method of selecting a vice president when a vacancy occurs in that office. It has since been invoked six times, most notably in the 1973 vice presidential and 1974 presidential succession of Gerald Ford.

In 1968, Bayh wrote &quot;One Heartbeat Away&quot;, a book about the passage of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. In the foreword, Lyndon Johnson describes the accomplishment as, &quot;He initiated and brought to fruition the first major alteration of Presidential and Vice-Presidential succession procedures since the ratification of the Constitution&quot;. The book&#x27;s preface is by former President Eisenhower, who wrote about the sixteen times there had been a vacancy in the office of Vice President and the measures taken to authorize Vice President Richard Nixon to act in his stead during the illnesses he experienced as president.

==== Lowering the voting age to 18 ====
As a state legislator in the 1950s, Bayh unsuccessfully worked to lower the voting age in Indiana. He continued his effort in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he also met opposition. In 1970, a new provision was added to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, lowering the voting age to 18 in all federal, state, and local elections. Then with the 1971 &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; decision, the Supreme Court ruled that state and local elections did not have to abide by the lowered voting age, though there would have to be dual elections in the 47 states where the lower federal voting age was not valid. Faced with another constitutional crisis, Bayh&#x27;s subcommittee quickly began hearings on an amendment to lower the voting age to 18. What became the Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed through Congress within weeks of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and was ratified by the states within months. 
As such, Senator Bayh is the only person since the Founding Fathers to have drafted more than one amendment to the United States Constitution.

=== 1964 plane crash ===
On June 19, 1964, Bayh, his wife, United States Senate member Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and legislative aide Edward Moss were on a small plane that crashed near Springfield, Massachusetts. The group was flying from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (then known as Washington National Airport) to the Massachusetts Democratic party&#x27;s convention, where Bayh was to be the keynote speaker. Senators Bayh and Kennedy were delayed by a vote which passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It had been held up by a filibuster. At approximately 11 p.m., the plane descended through heavy fog and crashed into an apple orchard. Bayh suffered muscular trauma and his wife fractured two vertebrae, but they were able to walk out of the wreckage. Kennedy was seriously injured, fracturing three vertebrae, breaking ribs and puncturing a lung, while Moss and the pilot, Edwin J. Zimny, suffered fatal injuries. Thrown to the front of the plane, Kennedy could not move from his waist down and could not reply to Bayh&#x27;s calling, &quot;Is there anybody alive up there? Is anybody alive?&quot; Bayh smelled gas and thought the plane might catch fire and explode, so he went back into the fuselage to check for survivors. At this point, Kennedy called out, &quot;I&#x27;m alive, Birch!&quot; and Bayh pulled Kennedy out of the plane to safety. Bayh went back again to check on Moss and Zimny, but they were unresponsive. Bayh and his wife then walked to the road to call for help.

In 1980, Bayh endorsed President Jimmy Carter for reelection, a decision that rankled the staff of Ted Kennedy, who was challenging Carter for the Democratic presidential nomination. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign adviser Bob Shrum called Bayh &quot;a son of a bitch&quot; in front of Kennedy, but as Shrum wrote in his memoir, &quot;Kennedy was disappointed in Bayh, but he didn&#x27;t want to hear anyone bitching about him. Bayh, he said, had a pass, and always would&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
==== Equal Rights Amendment ====
The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to establish equal rights for men and women under the Constitution of the United States, was first introduced in 1923 and then in every subsequent Congress for the next fifty years, with little to no success.

In 1970, Bayh witnessed one of these efforts to pass the ERA languish and fail due to poor-wording and &quot;poison pill&quot; conservative amendments. Through his Constitutional Amendments Subcommittee, Bayh drafted a new version of the ERA to be taken up by the 92nd United States Congress. Bayh based his appeal on extending the rights already guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to a person&#x27;s gender. The new version immediately won support from two important Senators who had opposed the earlier bill: Ted Kennedy and Robert P. Griffin, the assistant Republican leader. After the House approved its version under the leadership of Martha Griffiths of Michigan, the Senate easily passed Bayh&#x27;s ERA in March 1972, sending it to the states for ratification. The amendment had seven years to win approval in thirty-eight states. Thirty states ratified the ERA within the first two years, and another four joined in 1974 and 1975. Bayh&#x27;s home state of Indiana was the final state to ratify the ERA in January 1977, but by then, three states had rescinded their ratification, and three more would do so by the end of 1979. Bayh successfully fought to extend the seven-year ratification period to June 30, 1982, but the Equal Rights Amendment ultimately failed.

Bayh would later say he never anticipated how effective conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly &quot;telling flat-out lies&quot; would be. &quot;[Bayh] says he will never forget&quot;, the Associated Press reported, &quot;how she went on Indiana television, set her Social Security card on fire and argued that women would lose constitutional protections if ERA won&quot;.

==== &quot;The Father of Title IX&quot; ====
Bayh was influential in the addition of Title IX to the Higher Education Act, to give women equal opportunities in public education. Bayh was Title IX&#x27;s author, the first person to introduce it in Congress, and its chief Senate sponsor.
As Bayh was getting the Equal Rights Amendment out of committee, the Higher Education Act of 1965 was on the floor for reauthorization, and on February 28, 1972, Senator Bayh introduced the ERA&#x27;s equal education provision as an amendment.

In his remarks on the Senate floor, Bayh said, &quot;We are all familiar with the stereotype of women as pretty things who go to college to find a husband, go on to postgraduate education because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again. The desire of many schools not to waste a &#x27;man&#x27;s place&#x27; on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts absolutely contradict these myths about the &#x27;weaker sex&#x27; and it is time to change our operating assumptions&quot;.

&quot;While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching&quot;, Bayh concluded, &quot;it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs — an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work&quot;.

Title IX became law on June 23, 1972, and is best known for expanding opportunities for female athletes. Bayh has since been called &quot;the father of Title IX&quot;.

=== Haynsworth and Carswell nominations ===
During the 91st United States Congress, Bayh successfully led the Senate opposition to two of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States.

In August 1969, Nixon nominated Clement Haynsworth, a federal judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, to a vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the resignation of Abe Fortas on May 14, 1969. Labor and civil rights leaders, concerned with Haynsworth&#x27;s conservative record on workers&#x27; and civil rights, soon discovered that Haynsworth had recently ruled in a favor of a company in which he owned stock, and after questioning him on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Bayh felt Haynsworth did not recognize his own conflict of interest. By October, Bayh was widely recognized as &quot;the leading opponent&quot; of the nomination, and The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported how he &quot;worked with his staff into the night to complete a &quot;bill of particulars&quot; of alleged financial conflicts by Judge Haynsworth&quot;, ultimately uncovering several additional instances where Haynsworth had conflicts and misled in his Senate Judiciary testimony. Thus, in November 1969, Bayh and 54 other senators rejected the nomination.

On January 19, 1970, Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell of Florida, whom the Senate had confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit exactly seven months earlier. Carswell&#x27;s judicial record was even more conservative then Haynsworth&#x27;s and generally acknowledged to be mediocre, but after the earlier defeat of the latter&#x27;s nomination, most doubted there would be another major battle. Then a group of Yale Law School students visited Bayh in Washington and asked how they could help. Bayh suggested that they research every case that Carswell had decided in his judicial career. They did so and reported back that Carswell&#x27;s civil rights decisions had been reversed sixty percent of the time. With their research in hand, &quot;Bayh led the opposition interrogation of Carswell in the two weeks of committee hearings&quot;, &quot;United Press International&quot; reported. The Senate rejected Carswell&#x27;s nomination by a vote of 51 to 45.

Nixon publicly criticized Bayh and Senate opponents for overstepping their proper constitutional role, to which Bayh replied in a Senate floor speech by quoting from Article Two of the United States Constitution and calling the President &quot;wrong as a matter of constitutional law, wrong as a matter of history and wrong as a matter of public policy&quot;. Harry Blackmun was ultimately nominated and confirmed to fill the vacancy. Bayh later supported and voted to confirm Nixon&#x27;s nomination of Lewis F. Powell Jr., whom he knew well from work on the Twenty-fifth Amendment.

In an undated White House memorandum made public on June 27, 1973, Bayh&#x27;s name appeared on the master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents, a supplement to Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

=== Electoral College reform ===
The proposed Constitutional change with which Bayh was most closely associated in his final years in the Senate was his attempt to eliminate the United States Electoral College (the method of electing the President of the United States) and replace it with a popular vote in the 1960s and 1970s. One of Bayh&#x27;s proposals passed the House easily but was filibustered in the Senate. In 1977 he introduced reform legislation into the Senate, but it never achieved the required two-thirds vote in either house of Congress. In 2006, he joined the National Popular Vote Inc. coalition, which aims to effect Electoral College reform through an interstate compact. Bayh wrote a foreword to the book &quot;Every Vote Equal&quot; by John Koza, a co-founder of National Popular Vote.

=== Prison reform for juvenile offenders ===
As chairman of the Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, Bayh was the author, sponsor and chief architect of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, overhauling the youth prison system, including the requirement that juvenile offenders be separated from adults. After chairing 1971 hearings on brutality and corruption in the youth prison system, Bayh introduced legislation in February 1972, which was signed into law in 1974. Besides the deinstitutionalization of noncriminal offenders, it also created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention within the Department of Justice, to ensure ongoing protections. The landmark legislation was reauthorized in 2002. During the October 3, 1977, signing ceremony for H. R. 6111, an extension of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, President Jimmy Carter noted his discontent with Bayh not being in attendance as he had &quot;been very instrumental in the passage of this act&quot;.

=== 1976 presidential campaign ===
Bayh intended to run for the 1972 Democratic nomination for president, but his wife was diagnosed with cancer and he put his plans on hold. Before her death in 1979, Marvella Bayh became a leading anti-cancer activist.

On October 21, 1975, Bayh announced his candidacy for the 1976 Democratic nomination in a tour of his native state. &quot;People are looking to someone who can talk to them in terms they can understand&quot;, he said while struggling with laryngitis that day. With a liberal record and farm boy demeanor, Bayh&#x27;s candidacy was premised on his &#x27;electability.&#x27; His campaign literature was headlined, &quot;Yes He Can&quot;. In December 1975, Bayh came within a tenth of a percentage point from receiving the endorsement of the influential New Democratic Coalition, a liberal organization based in New York that helped George McGovern win the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination.

On the eve of the January 19, 1976, Iowa caucuses, Bayh and former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter were considered the leading candidates. Bayh ultimately finished a distant third behind Uncommitted delegates and Carter, seemingly hindered by his support for women&#x27;s rights. &quot;Bayh has become the focal point of the [abortion] issue&quot;, said the executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, since Bayh opposed a constitutional amendment banning abortion before his subcommittee. Liberal support did not coalesce and Bayh finished third in the New Hampshire primary and then seventh in the Massachusetts primary.

Bayh suspended his campaign on March 4, 1976, after 136 days as a formal candidate. At his final press conference, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m not prepared to crawl under a rock and say the future of Birch Bayh is over&quot;.

=== Bayh–Dole Act ===

In early 1978, the question of who owns government-funded research and who could therefore profit from it became personal for Bayh, as Marvella&#x27;s cancer returned and the Bayhs learned that a technology that could predict a patient&#x27;s reaction to chemotherapy was held up by restrictions on patent rights for federally sponsored research discoveries. This was part of a larger problem of stifling promising inventions, with 22 funding agencies disposing of patent rights in 22 different ways at the time.

Bayh invited United States Senate member Bob Dole, a Republican from Kansas, to craft a uniform policy. Together, they drafted the university and Small Business Patent Procedures Act, known as the Bayh–Dole Act, which allows United States universities, small businesses, and non-profit organizations to retain intellectual property rights of inventions developed from federal government-funded research. It was signed into law by President Carter on December 12, 1980.

In 2002, &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine said, &quot;Possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in America over the past half-century was the Bayh–Dole Act of 1980&quot;. A 2015 study determined that from 1996 to 2013, patent licensing made possible by Bayh–Dole increased gross industry output by approximately $1 trillion, supporting 3.8 million jobs in the United States.

=== Senate reelection campaigns ===

Bayh ran for reelection to the U.S. Senate three times. In the 1968 general election, Bayh defeated challenger William D. Ruckelshaus with 51.7% of the vote against a strong Republican tide, becoming only the fourth Indiana Democrat to be popularly elected to a second term in the Senate. In 1974, Bayh narrowly defeated Indianapolis Mayor Richard Lugar, garnering only 50.7 percent of the vote in what was otherwise a disastrous year for Republicans. Two years later, Lugar won Indiana&#x27;s other Senate seat by ousting Democratic incumbent Vance Hartke.

In 1980, Bayh faced United States House of Representatives member and future Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle. Bayh engaged the challenger in seven debates, and was defeated for reelection in the Republican landslide year, with 46.2% of the vote to Quayle&#x27;s 53.8%.

== Post-Senate career ==
=== Legal practice and business dealings ===
Returning to Indiana after his defeat in the 1980 election, Bayh founded the law firm of Bayh, Tabbert and Capehart, with offices in Indianapolis and in Washington, D.C.. Later in the 1980s he began to spend more time in Washington and left this practice. There he worked with several firms, including the well-known Venable LLP. Bayh also served on a number of corporate boards.

=== Advocacy and honors ===
In 1981, Bayh joined Robert Drinan, Don Edwards, Edith Green, Patsy Mink and Pat Schroeder to file an amicus brief before the Supreme Court in the case of &quot;North Haven Board of Education v. Bell&quot;. The brief urged affirmance of the lower court&#x27;s decision that Title IX proscribes employment discrimination in federally funded education programs. The court agreed. On August 19, 2004, Bayh filed an amicus brief in another case relating to Title IX, &quot;Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education&quot;. Bayh urged reversal of the lower court&#x27;s holding; the Supreme Court agreed, reversing the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and holding that Title IX created a private right of action to parties alleging retaliation for reporting sex discrimination.

On December 23, 2010, Bayh filed an amicus brief in &quot;Stanford v. Roche&quot;, a case in which the Supreme Court was asked to determine whether the Bayh-Dole Act required that ownership patents for inventions resulting from federally funded research must automatically go to the federal contractor. Bayh argued that &quot;a federal contractor&#x27;s ownership rights to inventions covered by the Bayh-Dole Act cannot be terminated unilaterally by an individual inventor through a separate agreement purporting to assign the inventor&#x27;s rights to a third party&quot;. The court disagreed, writing that &quot;the Bayh-Dole Act does not automatically vest title to federally funded inventions in federal contractors or authorize contractors to unilaterally take title to such inventions&quot;.

Bayh continued to advocate for the direct election of the president, speaking with lawmakers around the country about the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which states agree to pledge their presidential electors to the winner of the national popular vote once a majority of presidential electors join the compact. Bayh served on the advisory board of the non-profit, National Popular Vote, Inc.

Bayh served as a member of the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, as co-chair of the University of Virginia&#x27;s Miller Center National Commission on Presidential Disability and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, and as founding chairman of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence.
In 2003, Indianapolis&#x27;s historic U.S. Courthouse and Post Office was renamed in Bayh&#x27;s honor as the Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse.

In 2009, Indiana State University named their College of Education after the Bayh family; Senator Bayh was the fourth member of the Bayh family to attend Indiana State University (following his grandmother, father and mother); his late wife, Marvella Hern Bayh, was also an alumna of Indiana State University.

== Personal life ==
Bayh&#x27;s first wife was Marvella Bayh of Enid, Oklahoma. Their son Evan Bayh was born on December 26, 1955. Marvella Bayh died of breast cancer on April 24, 1979. Bayh subsequently married Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Halpin in 1981. Their son Christopher was born on July 22, 1982.

Birch and Kitty Bayh resided in Easton, Maryland. He was a fellow at the C.V Starr Center for the study of the American Experience of Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland.

Bayh died of pneumonia on March 14, 2019, in Easton, Maryland, at the age of 91. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Eastcote is a London Underground station in Eastcote in the west of Greater London. The station is on the branch of both the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines, between and stations. The station is located on Field End Road. It is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between and and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, being the only intermediate stop. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905.

Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades led to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Eastcote opened on 26 May 1906 as Eastcote Halt.

On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at was opened enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933 District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains. The station was rebuilt between 1937 and 1939 to a design by Charles Holden which features the large cube-shaped brick and glass ticket hall capped with a flat reinforced concrete roof and geometrical forms typical of the new stations built in this period. The station buildings and platforms are Grade II listed.

The station is surrounded by the suburb of Eastcote; the original centre, now known as Old Eastcote is some distance away. The Cavendish Pavilion nearby was a popular destination for outings in the first part of the twentieth century.

The tube station is currently not accessible for wheelchairs and buggies. In 2014, a campaign backed by paralympian Natasha Baker OBE backed a petition calling for step-free access in all Hillingdon stations including Eastcote and the issue was discussed by Hillingdon Council. At this time, a survey found that Eastcote had the second highest footfall in the Borough of Hillingdon, as well as high numbers of elderly residents and those with a long term disability. In 2023, a new petition calling for step-free access at Eastcote was backed by over 1000 residents. In 2023, Transport for London announced plans to review the potential for a lift at the station with the findings expected in late 2024.

<doc id="699078" wikidata="Q3116280" url="?curid=699078" title="Greg Sorbara">
<text>Gregory Samuel Sorbara (born September 4, 1946) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995, and again from 2001 to 2012 who represented ridings north of Toronto in the city of Vaughan. Sorbara served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty.

He resigned from cabinet October 11, 2005, following a police investigation involving his family&#x27;s real estate development firm and was reinstated on May 23, 2006 after a judge ruled that there was no cause for including Sorbara&#x27;s name on a search warrant. Sorbara chaired the party&#x27;s successful 2007 election campaign but announced on October 26, 2007 that he was leaving the cabinet to spend more time with his family but would continue as a backbench MPP. On August 1, 2012, Sorbara announced that he was retiring from the legislature but would stay on as chair of the Liberal&#x27;s election campaign. Sorbara was chancellor of York University from June 2014 to May 2023, succeeded by Kathleen Taylor.

==Family life and legal career==
Sorbara was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1946. His father, Sam Sorbara, immigrated to Canada from Italy in the 1920s. Sorbara graduated from St. Michael&#x27;s College School and attended University of Toronto for four years but left without graduating. In 1967 he joined the Company of Young Canadians in Vancouver, where he met his future partner, Kate Barlow. Later, he completed his education at York University and Osgoode Hall Law School, and began to practise law. His daughter Martina Sorbara is a singer-songwriter. 

On October 11, 2005, the RCMP raided the Sorbara Group offices as part of the Royal Group Technologies investigation. The police warrant stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe Sorbara and other directors of Royal Group defrauded the company and shareholders when they bought land in Brampton, that was owned by a subsidiary of the Sorbara Group. Sorbara initially resisted opposition calls for him to step down, but later resigned as Minister of Finance the same day. 

In 2017, Sorbara and family donated $5 million to the construction efforts of the Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital.

==Political career==
In the 1985 provincial election Sorbara ran as the Liberal in the riding of York North, a suburban riding north of Toronto. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent William Hodgson by 4,100 votes. The Liberals under David Peterson were able to form a minority government after this election, and Sorbara was appointed Minister of Colleges and Universities and Minister of Skills Development on June 26, 1985.

Sorbara was re-elected in the redistributed riding of York Centre in the 1987 provincial election. On September 29, 1987, he became Minister of Labour with responsibility for Women&#x27;s Issues. Following a cabinet shuffle in August 1989, he became Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations.

In 1990 the Liberals were upset by the New Democratic Party in the election which followed, though Sorbara won in his riding.


===1992 leadership race===
On November 14, 1991, Sorbara announced that he was joining the race to replace Peterson as leader of the party. He stated, &quot;We have to stop this province&#x27;s slide into a low-wage, no-growth economy,&quot; and spoke of infrastructure investment. During the convention which was held in Hamilton, Ontario on February 9, he finished third on the first ballot, and remained in this position until dropping from the race after the fourth ballot. Sorbara subsequently refused to support either Murray Elston or Lyn McLeod (the eventual winner) on the fifth and final ballot. and did not seek re-election in 1995.

Sorbara supported Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s successful bid for the provincial party leadership at the 1996 leadership convention. He did not run in the 1999 provincial election, but was elected Party President over Alvin Curling in November 1999. He later won a 2001 by-election in the redistributed Greater Toronto Area riding of Vaughan—King—Aurora, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Joyce Frustaglio by almost 10,000 votes. Sorbara delivered a statement in May 2010, supporting the minority Muslim sect, Ahmadiyya, who were recently attacked in Lahore for practicing their faith.

===Minister of Finance===
The Liberals won the 2003 election, and Sorbara was appointed Minister of Finance in the Ontario Cabinet on October 23, 2003.

Sorbara became involved in a conflict-of-interest controversy not long after his appointment. In late 2003, the Ontario Securities Commission informed Sorbara&#x27;s office that Royal Group Technologies would be announcing they were under investigation by the OSC. As a former director of Royal Group, this placed Sorbara in a conflict of interest as he also oversaw the OSC. Sorbara could not consult the Premier concerning the conflict of interest as he was restricted by the province&#x27;s Securities Act from informing anyone else of the impending announcement by the company. Royal Group did not announce the investigation for almost two months.

There were calls for Sorbara to resign after the controversy became public knowledge, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the provincial integrity commissioner in August 2004.

On May 18, 2004, Sorbara released the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget. The centrepiece was a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign pledge not to raise taxes, and gave the government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium by pointing to the previous government&#x27;s hidden deficit, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts. This broken promise has created a lasting public relations difficulty for the Liberal Party.

The Ontario Health Premium also became a major issue in the early days of the 2004 federal election, called a week after the Ontario budget. Most believe that the controversy hampered Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s bid for re-election.

Also controversial was the elimination of coverage for health services not covered by the Canada Health Act including eye examinations and physical therapy. Other elements of the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget were a four-year plan to tackle the deficit left behind by the Conservatives, free immunization for children, investments in education and investments to lower waiting times for cancer care, cardiac care, joint replacement and MRI and CT scans.

On May 11, 2005, Sorbara delivered his second budget. The flagship of the budget was the &quot;Reaching Higher&quot; plan. Investing $6.2 billion over four years, the plan increased accessibility for low-income students with loans and grants while funding more enrollments, expanded medical school spaces, and invested in new faculty, graduate scholarships and research.

The budget also projected breaking a vow to balance the future 2007–08 budget. Sorbara instead aimed at balance in 2008–09.

Sorbara also moved to expand infrastructure spending by encouraging Ontario&#x27;s large pension plans to invest in the construction of new roads, schools and hospitals. Specific projects in the budget included a 10-year expansion of the TTC and Go Transit, 15,000 new affordable housing units and improved border crossings. NDP leader Howard Hampton described this move as &quot;privatization by stealth.&quot;

After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, Sorbara was also named as the Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet.

Sorbara was re-elected to the Legislature in the 2007 election, and subsequently on October 26, 2007, he announced that he no longer wanted to sit in Cabinet, citing he wanted to devote more time for his constituents and his family.

<text>Carson Sink is a playa in the northeastern portion of the Carson Desert in present-day Nevada, United States of America, that was formerly the terminus of the Carson River. Today the sink is fed by drainage canals of the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District. The southeastern fringe of the sink, where the canals enter, is a wetland of the Central Basin and Range ecoregion. 

This is mostly included within the Fallon National Wildlife Refuge and the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area. This area serves as an important stopover for migrating waterfowl. The Sehoo Formation is south of the Carson Sink.

==Carson Sink and Lone Rock working areas==

The Carson Sink and Lone Rock working areas are the northwest portion of both the Carson Sink and the US Naval Fallon Range Training Complex. The Lone Rock working area includes the Bravo-20 range, which has numerous targets for combat aircraft training. 

Lone Rock is in the middle of a Bravo-20 live bombing area. It is a solitary pinnacle of rock through the playa and it is held sacred by the Northern Paiute.

==History==
The Carson Sink was a deep portion of the Pleistocene water body Lake Lahontan, the lakebed of which is now the Lahontan Basin. 

The Carson Trail, used during the California Gold Rush across the Lahontan Basin, included a section through the Forty Mile Desert to the first drinkable water on the Carson River. The Carson Sink station of the Pony Express was built in March 1860.

In June 1952 two U.S. Air Force colonels flew a B-25 bomber from Hamilton Field near San Francisco to Colorado Springs, Colorado. While passing over Carson Sink, the two reportedly saw three unknown aircraft fly within 800 yards of their aircraft before speeding out of sight seconds later. Upon landing, the two colonels reported the incident to the Air Defence Command headquarters, who informed them that there were no military or civilian aircraft in the area at the time. The incident was never resolved and is known today as the Carson Sink UFO incident.

In 1984, the natural dike between the Carson Sink and the Humboldt Sink was breached by the Nevada Department of Transportation to prevent Interstate 80 and the town of Lovelock from flooding due to unusually heavy snowfall in the preceding three years. The sinks remained connected by water for three years, until 1987.

<doc id="699087" wikidata="Q1524227" url="?curid=699087" title="Joseph McDowell Jr.">
<text>Joseph &quot;Quaker Meadows&quot; McDowell Jr. (February 15, 1756July 11, 1801) was an American planter, soldier, and statesman from North Carolina. He was known as &quot;Quaker Meadows Joe&quot; to distinguish him from his cousin Joseph &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; McDowell, who was also a legislator and American Revolutionary War officer from North Carolina. The two men are not always clearly distinguished in historical records; both were in the 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain, one as a major in the Burke County Regiment of the North Carolina militia, and the other in a subordinate role as a captain.

==Early life==
McDowell was born in Winchester in the Virginia Colony on February 15, 1756. His parents were Joseph McDowell, Sr. (1715–1771) who was an Ulster Scot immigrant who was a Presbyterian of Scottish descent from Ballycarry, Ireland (in what has since become Northern Ireland and Virginia Margaret O&#x27;Neil (1717–1790) who was Catholic from County Cavan, Ireland. The family moved to Rowan County, North Carolina in 1758. Joseph McDowell grew up on his family&#x27;s estate, &quot;Quaker Meadows&quot;, in Rowan County, North Carolina (in the area that became Burke County in 1777).

==Congressional service==
He was a delegate to the Hillsborough Convention in 1788 and the Fayetteville Convention in 1789 that approved the U.S. Constitution for North Carolina. McDowell served in the 5th United States Congress from 1797 to 1799. He is sometimes credited as also having served in the 3rd United States Congress (1793–1795), but according to the &quot;Biographical Directory of the United States Congress&quot;, it was his cousin, Joseph &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; McDowell, who served at that time. His son Joseph J. McDowell also served in Congress.

==Military service==
He served in the North Carolina militia during the American Revolution.
* Major in the 2nd Rowan County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1776-1777)
* Major in the Burke County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1777-1781)
* Lt. Colonel in the Burke County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1781-1782)
* Colonel over the Burke County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1782-1783)

Known engagements that he participated in included:
* April 10–20, 1779 Chickamauga Towns
* June 20, 1779, Battle of Stono Ferry, South Carolina
* July 15, 1780, Earle&#x27;s Ford, South Carolina
* June 20, 1780, Battle of Ramseur&#x27;s Mill
* August 18, 1780, Battle of Musgrove&#x27;s Mill, South Carolina
* September 12, 1780, Battle of Cane Creek/Lindley&#x27;s Mill
* October 8, 1780, Battle of Kings Mountain, South Carolina
* January 17, 1781, Battle of Cowpens, South Carolina
* 1782, Cherokee Expedition

==Death==
McDowell died July 11, 1801 in Burke County, North Carolina. He was buried at the Quaker Meadows Cemetery, Morganton, Burke County, North Carolina.

<doc id="699090" wikidata="Q7539765" url="?curid=699090" title="Chronotherapy (sleep phase)">
<text>Chronotherapy is a behavioural treatment that attempts to move bedtime and rising time later and later each day, around the clock, until a person is sleeping on a normal schedule. This treatment can be used by people with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), who generally cannot reset their circadian rhythm by moving their bedtime and rising time earlier. DSPD is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, characterised by a mismatch between a person&#x27;s internal biological clock and societal norms. Chronotherapy uses the human phase response to light or melatonin. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended chronotherapy for the treatment of circadian rhythm and sleep disorders.

== Example ==

Here is an example of how chronotherapy could work over a week&#x27;s course of treatment, with the patient going to sleep 3 hours later every day until the desired sleep and wake time is reached.

* Day 1: sleep 3:00 am to 11:00 am
* Day 2: sleep 6:00 am to 2:00 pm
* Day 3: sleep 9:00 am to 5:00 pm
* Day 4: sleep 12:00 pm to 8:00 pm
* Day 5: sleep 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm
* Day 6: sleep 6:00 pm to 2:00 am next day
* Day 7: sleep 9:00 pm to 5:00 am next day
* Day 8 and thereafter: sleep 12:00 am to 8:00 am next day

While this technique can provide respite from sleep deprivation for people who must wake early for school or work, the new sleep and wake times can only be maintained by following a strictly disciplined timetable for sleeping and rising.

== Other forms of sleep phase chronotherapy ==

A modified chronotherapy is called controlled sleep deprivation with phase advance, SDPA. One stays awake one whole night and day, then goes to bed 90 minutes &quot;earlier&quot; than usual and maintains the new bedtime for a week. This process is repeated weekly until the desired bedtime is reached.

Sometimes, although extremely infrequently, &quot;reverse&quot; chronotherapy – i.e., gradual movements of bedtime and rising time &quot;earlier&quot; each day – has been used in treatment of patients with abnormally short circadian rhythms, in an attempt to move their bedtimes to &quot;later&quot; times of the day. Because circadian rhythms substantially shorter than 24 hours are extremely rare, this type of chronotherapy has remained largely experimental.

== Side effects ==

The safety of chronotherapy is not fully known. While chronotherapy has been successful for some, it is necessary to rigidly maintain the desired sleep/wake cycle thenceforth. Any deviation in schedule tends to allow the body clock to shift later again.

Chronotherapy has been known to cause non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in at least three recorded cases, as reported in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1992. Animal studies have suggested that such lengthening could &quot;slow the intrinsic rhythm of the body clock to such an extent that the normal 24-hour day no longer lies within its range of entrainment.&quot;

<doc id="699110" wikidata="Q243570" url="?curid=699110" title="Light therapy">
<text>Light therapy, also called phototherapy or bright light therapy is the exposure to direct sunlight or artificial light at controlled wavelengths in order to treat a variety of medical disorders, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD), circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, cancers, neonatal jaundice, and skin wound infections. Treating skin conditions such as neurodermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, and eczema with ultraviolet light is called ultraviolet light therapy.

== Medical uses ==
=== Nutrient deficiency ===

==== Vitamin D deficiency ====
Exposure to UV-B light at wavelengths of 290-300 nanometers enables the body to produce vitamin D3 to treat vitamin D3 deficiency.

=== Skin conditions ===
Light therapy treatments for the skin usually involve exposure to ultraviolet light. The exposures can be to a small area of the skin or over the whole body surface, as in a tanning bed. The most common treatment is with narrowband UVB, which has a wavelength of approximately 311–313 nanometers. Full body phototherapy can be delivered at a doctor&#x27;s office or at home using a large high-power UVB booth. Tanning beds, however, generate mostly UVA light, and only 4% to 10% of tanning-bed light is in the UVB spectrum.

==== Acne vulgaris ====
 evidence for light therapy and lasers in the treatment of acne vulgaris was not sufficient to recommend them. There is moderate evidence for the efficacy of blue and blue-red light therapies in treating mild acne, but most studies are of low quality. While light therapy appears to provide short-term benefit, there is a lack of long-term outcome data or data in those with severe acne.

==== Atopic dermatitis ====
Light therapy is considered one of the best monotherapy treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) when applied to patients who have not responded to traditional topical treatments. The therapy offers a wide range of options: UVA1 for acute AD, NB-UVB for chronic AD, and balneophototherapy have proven their efficacy. Patients tolerate the therapy safely but, as in any therapy, there are potential adverse effects and care must be taken in its application, particularly to children. According to a study involving 21 adults with severe atopic dermatitis, narrowband UVB phototherapy administered three times per week for 12 weeks reduced atopic dermatitis severity scores by 68%. In this open study, 15 patients still experienced long-term benefits six months later.

==== Cancer ====
According to the American Cancer Society, there is some evidence that ultraviolet light therapy may be effective in helping treat certain kinds of skin cancer, and ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy is established for this application. However, alternative uses of light for cancer treatment – light box therapy and colored light therapy – are not supported by evidence. Photodynamic therapy (often with red light) is used to treat certain superficial non-melanoma skin cancers.

==== Psoriasis ====
For psoriasis, UVB phototherapy has been shown to be effective. A feature of psoriasis is localized inflammation mediated by the immune system. Ultraviolet radiation is known to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammatory responses. Light therapy for skin conditions like psoriasis usually use 313 nanometer UVB though it may use UVA (315–400 nm wavelength) or a broader spectrum UVB (280–315 nm wavelength). UVA combined with psoralen, a drug taken orally, is known as PUVA treatment. In UVB phototherapy the exposure time is very short, seconds to minutes depending on intensity of lamps and the person&#x27;s skin pigment and sensitivity.

==== Vitiligo ====
About 1% of the human population has vitiligo which causes painless distinct light-colored patches of the skin on the face, hands, and legs. Phototherapy is an effective treatment because it forces skin cells to manufacture melanin to protect the body from UV damage. Prescribed treatment is generally 3 times a week in a clinic or daily at home. About 1 month usually results in re-pigmentation in the face and neck, and 2–4 months in the hands and legs. Narrowband UVB is more suitable to the face and neck and PUVA is more effective at the hands and legs.

==== Other skin conditions ====
Some types of phototherapy may be effective in the treatment of polymorphous light eruption, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and lichen planus. Narrowband UVB between 311 and 313 nanometers is the most common treatment.

=== Retinal conditions ===
There is preliminary evidence that light therapy is an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.

=== Mood and sleep related ===
==== Seasonal affective disorder ====
The effectiveness of light therapy for treating seasonal affective disorder (SAD) may be linked to the fact that light therapy makes up for lost sunlight exposure and resets the body&#x27;s internal clock. Studies show that light therapy helps reduce the debilitating and depressive behaviors of SAD, such as excessive sleepiness and fatigue, with results lasting for at least 1 month. Light therapy is preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of SAD because it is a relatively safe and easy therapy. Two methods of light therapy, bright light and dawn simulation, have similar success rates in the treatment of SAD.

It is possible that response to light therapy for SAD could be season dependent. Morning therapy has provided the best results because light in the early morning aids in regulating the circadian rhythm. People affected by SAD have low levels of energy and have difficulty concentrating. They usually have a change in appetite and experience trouble sleeping.

A 2007 systematic review by the Swedish agency SBU found insufficient evidence that light therapy was able to alleviate symptoms of depression or seasonal affective disorder. The report recommended that: &quot;Approximately 100 participants are required to establish whether the therapy is moderately more effective than placebo&quot;. Although treatment in light therapy rooms was well established in Sweden, no satisfactory, controlled studies had been published on the subject. This led to the closure of a number of clinics offering light therapy in Sweden.

A Cochrane review conducted in 2019 states the evidence that light therapy&#x27;s effectiveness as a treatment for the &quot;prevention&quot; of seasonal affective disorder is limited, although the risk of adverse effects are minimal. Therefore, the decision to use light therapy should be based on a person&#x27;s preference of treatment.

==== Non-seasonal depression ====
Light therapy has also been suggested in the treatment of non-seasonal depression and other psychiatric mood disturbances, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and postpartum depression. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that &quot;for patients suffering from non-seasonal depression, light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy.&quot; A 2008 systematic review concluded that &quot;overall, bright light therapy is an excellent candidate for inclusion into the therapeutic inventory available for the treatment of nonseasonal depression today, as adjuvant therapy to antidepressant medication, or eventually as stand-alone treatment for specific subgroups of depressed patients.&quot; A 2015 review found that supporting evidence for light therapy was limited due to serious methodological flaws.

A 2016 meta-analysis showed that bright light therapy appeared to be efficacious, particularly when administered for 2–5 weeks&#x27; duration and as monotherapy.

==== Chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD) ====
In the management of circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), the timing of light exposure is critical. Light exposure administered to the eyes before or after the nadir of the core body temperature rhythm can affect the phase response curve. Use upon awakening may also be effective for non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder. Some users have reported success with lights that turn on shortly &quot;before&quot; awakening (dawn simulation). Evening use is recommended for people with advanced sleep phase disorder. Some, but not all, totally blind people whose retinae are intact, may benefit from light therapy.

==== Circadian rhythm sleep disorders and jet lag====

Source:

===== Situational CRSD =====
Light therapy has been tested for individuals with shift work sleep disorder and for jet lag.

===== Sleep disorder in Parkinson&#x27;s disease =====
Light therapy has been trialed in treating sleep disorders experienced by patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

===== Sleep disorder in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease =====
Studies have shown that daytime and evening light therapy for nursing home patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, who often struggle with agitation and fragmented wake/rest cycles effectively led to more consolidated sleep and an increase in circadian rhythm stability.

=== Neonatal jaundice (Postnatal Jaundice) ===

Light therapy is used to treat cases of neonatal jaundice. Bilirubin, a yellow pigment normally formed in the liver during the breakdown of old red blood cells, cannot always be effectively cleared by a neonate&#x27;s liver causing neonatal jaundice. Accumulation of excess bilirubin can cause central nervous system damage, and so this buildup of bilirubin must be treated. Phototherapy uses the energy from light to isomerize the bilirubin and consequently transform it into compounds that the newborn can excrete via urine and stools. Bilirubin is most successful absorbing light in the blue region of the visible light spectrum, which falls between 460 and 490 nm. Therefore, light therapy technologies that utilize these blue wavelengths are the most successful at isomerizing bilirubin.

== Techniques ==
=== Photodynamic therapy ===
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a form of phototherapy using nontoxic light-sensitive compounds (photosensitizers) that are exposed selectively to light at a controlled wavelength, laser intensity, and irradiation time, whereupon they generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that target malignant and other diseased cells. Oxygen is thus required for activity, lowering efficacy in highly developed tumors and other hypoxic environments. Selective apoptosis of diseased cells is difficult due to the radical nature of ROS, but may be controlled for through membrane potential and other cell-type specific properties&#x27; effects on permeability or through photoimmunotherapy. In developing any phototherapeutic agent, the phototoxicity of the treatment wavelength should be considered. 

==== Photodynamic cancer therapy ====
Various cancer treatments utilizing PDT have been approved by the FDA. Treatments are available for actinic keratosis (blue light with aminolevulinic acid), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Barrett esophagus, basal cell skin cancer, esophageal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and squamous cell skin cancer (Stage 0). Photosensitizing agents clinically-approved or undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of cancers include Photofrin, Temoporfin, Motexafin lutetium, Palladium bacteriopheophorbide, Purlytin, and Talaporfin. Verteporfin is approved to treat eye conditions such as macular degeneration, myopia, and ocular histoplasmosis. Third-generation photosensitizers are currently in development, but none are yet approved for clinical trials.

==== Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ====
PDT may also be utilized to treat multidrug-resistant skin, wound, or other superficial infections. This is known as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) or photodynamic inactivation (PDI). aPDT has been observed to be effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&quot; and &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. aPDT has shown lowered efficacy on some other bacterial species, such as &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;. This is likely due to factors such as cell wall thickness and membrane potential. Many studies utilizing aPDT focus on the application of the photosensitizer through leakage from a hydrogel, which has been found to increase wound healing speed of skin infections through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). This controlled leakage allows for prolonged but limited generation of ROS, lowering the impact on human cell viability due to ROS cytotoxicity. It is unlikely for drug resistance to photosensitizers to form due to the nontoxic nature of the photosensitizer itself as well as the ROS generation mechanism of action, which cannot be prevented outside of hypoxic environments. Certain dental infections (peri-implantitis, periodontitis) are more difficult to treat with PDT as opposed to photothermal therapy due to the requirement of oxygen, though a significant response is still observed.

Increased antimicrobial activity and wound healing speeds are typically observed when PDT is combined with photothermal therapy in photodynamic/photothermal combination therapy.

=== Photothermal Therapy ===

Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a form of phototherapy that uses non-toxic compounds called photothermal agents (PTA) that, when irradiated at a certain wavelength of light, converts the light energy directly to heat energy. The photothermal conversion efficiency determines the amount of light converted to heat, which can dictate the necessary irradiation time and/or laser intensity for treatments. Typically PTT treatments use wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) spectra, which can be further divided into NIR-I (760-900 nm), NIR-II (900-1880 nm), and NIR-III (2080-2340 nm) windows. Wavelengths in these regions are typically less phototoxic than UV or high-energy visible light. In addition, NIR-II wavelengths have been observed to show deeper penetration than NIR-I wavelengths, allowing for treatment of deeper wounds, infections, and cancers. Important considerations for the development of a PTA include photothermal conversion efficiency, phototoxicity, laser intensity, irradiation time, and the temperature at which human cell viability is impaired (around 46-60 °C). Currently, the only FDA-approved photothermal agent is indocyanine green which is active against both tumor and bacterial cells. 

PTT is less selective than photodynamic therapy (PDT, see above) due to its heat-based mechanism of action, but also less likely to promote drug resistance than most, if not all, currently developed treatments. In addition, PTT can be used in hypoxic environments and on deeper wounds, infections, and tumors than PDT due to the higher wavelength of light. Due to PTT activity in hypoxic environments, it may be also used on more developed tumors than PDT. Low-temperature PTT (≤ 45 °C) for treatment of infections is also a possibility when combined with an antibiotic compound due to heat&#x27;s proportionality with membrane permeability - a hotter environment causes heightened membrane permeability, which thus allows the drug into the cell. This would reduce/eliminate the impact on human cell viability, and aiding in antibiotic accumulation within the target cell may assist in restoring activity in antibiotics that pathogens had developed resistance to.

PTT is typically seen to have improved antimicrobial and wound healing activity when combined with an additional mechanism of action through PDT or added antibiotic compounds in the application. 

=== Light boxes ===

The production of the hormone melatonin, a sleep regulator, is inhibited by light and permitted by darkness as registered by photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. To some degree, the reverse is true for serotonin, which has been linked to mood disorders. Hence, for the purpose of manipulating melatonin levels or timing, light boxes providing very specific types of artificial illumination to the retina of the eye are effective.

Light therapy uses either a light box which emits up to 10,000 lux of light at a specified distance, much brighter than a customary lamp, or a lower intensity of specific wavelengths of light from the blue (460 nm) to the green (525 nm) areas of the visible spectrum. A 1995 study showed that green light therapy at doses of 350 lux produces melatonin suppression and phase shifts equivalent to 10,000 lux white light therapy, but another study published in May 2010 suggests that the blue light often used for SAD treatment should perhaps be replaced by green or white illumination, because of a possible involvement of the cones in melatonin suppression.

== Risks and complications ==
=== Ultraviolet ===
Ultraviolet light causes progressive damage to human skin and erythema even from small doses. This is mediated by genetic damage, collagen damage, as well as destruction of vitamin A and vitamin C in the skin and free radical generation. Ultraviolet light is also known to be a factor in formation of cataracts. Ultraviolet radiation exposure is strongly linked to incidence of skin cancer.

=== Visible light ===
Optical radiation of any kind with enough intensity can cause damage to the eyes and skin including photoconjunctivitis and photokeratitis. Researchers have questioned whether limiting blue light exposure could reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, there is no scientific evidence showing that exposure to blue light emitting devices result in eye damage. According to Harriet Hall, blue light exposure is reported to suppress the production of melatonin, which affects our body&#x27;s circadian rhythm and can decrease sleep quality. It is reported that, in reproductive-age females, bright light therapy may activate the production of reproductive hormones, such as luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol

Modern phototherapy lamps used in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder and sleep disorders either filter out or do not emit ultraviolet light and are considered safe and effective for the intended purpose, as long as photosensitizing drugs are not being taken at the same time and in the absence of any existing eye conditions. Light therapy is a mood altering treatment, and just as with drug treatments, there is a possibility of triggering a manic state from a depressive state, causing anxiety and other side effects. While these side effects are usually controllable, it is recommended that patients undertake light therapy under the supervision of an experienced clinician, rather than attempting to self-medicate.

Contraindications to light therapy for seasonal affective disorder include conditions that might render the eyes more vulnerable to phototoxicity, tendency toward mania, photosensitive skin conditions, or use of a photosensitizing herb (such as St. John&#x27;s wort) or medication. Patients with porphyria should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as methotrexate or chloroquine should use caution with light therapy as there is a chance that these drugs could cause porphyria.

Side effects of light therapy for sleep phase disorders include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, eye irritation and nausea. Some non-depressive physical complaints, such as poor vision and skin rash or irritation, may improve with light therapy.

== History ==

Many ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Rome. The Inca, Assyrian and early Germanic peoples also worshipped the sun as a health bringing deity. Indian medical literature dating to 1500 BCE describes a treatment combining herbs with natural sunlight to treat non-pigmented skin areas. Buddhist literature from about 200 CE and 10th-century Chinese documents make similar references.

The Faroese physician Niels Finsen is believed to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first artificial light source for this purpose. Finsen used short wavelength light to treat lupus vulgaris, a skin infection caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;. He thought that the beneficial effect was due to ultraviolet light killing the bacteria, but recent studies showed that his lens and filter system did not allow such short wavelengths to pass through, leading instead to the conclusion that light of approximately 400 nanometers generated reactive oxygen that would kill the bacteria. Finsen also used red light to treat smallpox lesions. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1903. Scientific evidence for some of his treatments is lacking, and later eradication of smallpox and development of antibiotics for tuberculosis rendered light therapy obsolete for these diseases. In the early 20th-century light therapy was promoted by Auguste Rollier and John Harvey Kellogg. In 1924, Caleb Saleeby founded The Sunlight League.

From the late nineteenth century until the early 1930s, light therapy was considered an effective and mainstream medical therapy in the UK for conditions such as varicose ulcer, &#x27;sickly children&#x27; and a wide range of other conditions. Controlled trials by the medical scientist Dora Colebrook, supported by the Medical Research Council, indicated that light therapy was not effective for such a wide range of conditions.

<text>Joseph &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; McDowell (February 25, 1758 – May 18, 1795) was an American lawyer, soldier, and statesman from Morganton, North Carolina.

His estate was named &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot;, and he was nicknamed &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; Joe to distinguish him from his cousin, Joseph &quot;Quaker Meadows&quot; McDowell. The two men are not always clearly distinguished in historical records: both were at the 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain, one as a major leading the Burke County militia, and the other in a subordinate role as a captain. Although &quot;Quaker Meadows&quot; Joe is usually hailed as the Major McDowell who was the hero of the battle, some descendants of &quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; Joe maintain that it was their ancestor who led the Burke County militia, a claim which is contradicted by contemporary evidence.

&quot;Pleasant Gardens&quot; McDowell was later appointed a North Carolina militia general, and served in the 3rd United States Congress from 1793 to 1795. However, these accomplishments are sometimes credited to Joseph &quot;Quaker Meadows&quot; McDowell, although the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; notes that the Congressional directory may be correct.

He was a delegate from Burke County to both the Hillsborough Convention of 1788 and the Fayetteville Convention of 1789 that approved the United States Constitution.

McDowell died on May 18, 1795, on his estate in what was Burke County, North Carolina, but is now part of McDowell County, North Carolina.

<text>The Marfa lights, also known as the Marfa ghost lights, are regularly observed near Marfa, Texas, in the United States. They are most often seen from a viewing area nearby, which the community has publicized to encourage tourism. Scientists observing the lights over the period 2000 to 2008 concluded that the lights were the results of automobile headlights being distorted by warm desert air.

==Overview==

According to Judith Brueske, the best place from which to view the lights is a widened shoulder on Highway 90 about nine miles east of Marfa. The lights are most often reported as distant spots of brightness, distinguishable from ranch lights and automobile headlights on Highway 67 (between Marfa and Presidio, to the south) primarily by their aberrant movements.&quot;

Robert and Judy Wagers define &quot;Classic Marfa Lights&quot; as being seen south-southwest of the Marfa Lights Viewing Center (MLVC). They define the left margin of the viewing area as being aligned along the Big Bend Telephone Company tower as viewed from the MLVC, and the right margin as Chinati Peak as viewed from the MLVC.

Referring to the Marfa Lights View Park east of Marfa, James Bunnell describes Marfa lights as &quot;orbs of light&quot;, which change in intensity and color, which can move or remain stationary, splitting or merging. He describes the lights as being usually yellow-orange, but also occasionally other hues including green, blue, and red. He states that they usually fly above desert vegetation but below mesas in the background.

==History==
The first historical record of the Marfa lights was in 1883 when a young cowhand, Robert Reed Ellison, saw a flickering light while he was driving cattle through Paisano Pass and wondered if it was the campfire of the Apache. Other settlers told him they often saw the lights, but that when they investigated they found no ashes or other evidence of a campsite. Joe and Anne Humphreys next reported seeing the lights in 1885.

The first published account of the lights appeared in the July 1957 issue of &quot;Coronet&quot; magazine. In 1976 Elton Miles&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Big Bend&quot; included stories dating to the 19th century and a photograph of the Marfa lights by a local rancher.

Bunnell lists 34 Marfa lights sightings from 1945 through 2008. Monitoring stations were put in place starting in 2003. He has identified &quot;an average of 9.5 MLs on 5.25 nights per year&quot;, but believes that the monitoring stations may only be finding half of the Marfa lights in Mitchell Flat.

==Explanations==

===Atmospheric phenomena===

Skeptic Brian Dunning notes that the designated &quot;View Park&quot; for the lights, a roadside park on the south side of U.S. Route 90 about 9 miles (14 km) east of Marfa, is at the site of Marfa Army Airfield, where tens of thousands of personnel were stationed between 1942 and 1947, training American and Allied pilots. This massive field was then used for years as a regional airport, with daily airline service. Since Marfa AAF and its satellite fields are each constantly patrolled by sentries, they consider it unlikely that any unusual phenomena would remain unobserved and unmentioned. According to Dunning, the likeliest explanation is that the lights are a sort of mirage caused by sharp temperature gradients between cold and warm layers of air. Marfa is at an elevation of 4,688 ft (1,429 m) above sea level, and differences of 40–50 °F (22–28 °C) between daily high and low temperatures are quite common.

===Car lights===

In May 2004 a group from the Society of Physics Students at the University of Texas at Dallas spent four days investigating and recording lights observed southwest of the view park using traffic volume-monitoring equipment, video cameras, binoculars, and chase cars. Their report made the following conclusions:
* U.S. Highway 67 is visible from the Marfa lights viewing location.
* The frequency of lights southwest of the view park correlates with the frequency of vehicle traffic on U.S. 67.
* The motion of the observed lights was in a straight line, corresponding to U.S. 67.
* When the group parked a vehicle on U.S. 67 and flashed its headlights, this was visible at the view park and appeared to be a Marfa light.
* A car passing the parked vehicle appeared as one Marfa light passing another at the view park.

They came to the conclusion that all the lights observed over a four-night period southwest of the view park could be reliably attributed to automobile headlights traveling along U.S. 67 between Marfa and Presidio, Texas.

====Spectroscopic analysis====

For 20 nights in May 2008, scientists from Texas State University used spectroscopy equipment to observe lights from the Marfa lights viewing station. They recorded a number of lights that &quot;could have been mistaken for lights of unknown origin&quot;, but in each case the movements of the lights and the data from their equipment could be easily explained as automobile headlights or small fires. They concluded that due to the rarity of observation of &quot;genuine&quot; Marfa lights, those with odd behaviour not explainable as car lights, more research was necessary to determine their nature.

==In popular media==
The lights have been featured and mentioned in various media, including the television show &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; and an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (&quot;Of Mice and Little Green Men&quot;) and in an episode of the Disney Channel Original Series &quot;So Weird&quot;. A book by David Morrell, 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Shimmer&quot;, was inspired by the lights. The Rolling Stones mention the &quot;lights of Marfa&quot; in the song &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; from the 2011 re-release of their 1978 album &quot;Some Girls&quot;. Country music artist Paul Cauthen wrote &quot;Marfa Lights,&quot; a love song inspired by the lights, for his 2016 album &quot;My Gospel.&quot;
In the 2019 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Mad About the Toy&quot;, the family visits Marfa.
Lisa tries to explain the lights but is prevented by Marge. The Union Trade had a song called &quot;Marfa Lights&quot; on their 2015 album &quot;A Place Of Long Years&quot;.

<doc id="699128" wikidata="Q2146846" url="?curid=699128" title="Carson River">
<text>The Carson River is a northwestern Nevada river that empties into the Carson Sink, an endorheic basin. The main stem of the river is long although the addition of the East Fork makes the total length , traversing five counties: Alpine County in California and Douglas, Storey, Lyon, and Churchill Counties in Nevada, as well as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, Nevada. The river is named for Kit Carson, who guided John C. Frémont&#x27;s expedition westward up the Carson Valley and across Carson Pass in winter, 1844. The river made the National Priorities List (NPL) on October 30, 1990 as the Carson River Mercury Superfund site (CRMS) due to investigations that showed trace amounts of mercury in the wildlife and watershed sediments.

==History==
Archaeological findings place the eastern border for the prehistoric Martis people in the Reno/Carson River area, these are thought to be the first humans to enter the area about 12,000 years ago. By the early 1800s, the Northern Paiute lived near the lower Carson River and the present Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge, while the Washoe people inhabited the upper watershed region.

The Carson River watershed was a shared territory between these two tribes. The Northern Paiute of western Nevada was grouped into several bands relating to the area that they inhabited. The group that established itself along the Carson River were known in the Shoshone language as &quot;Toituked&quot;. The Washoe peoples that had residence in the Carson Valley were also divided into a separate group and called &quot;Pau wa lu&quot;. Ancient people and indigenous tribes used the Carson River as a resource for livelihood, depending on the river for fish, waterfowl, plant materials, and especially water in the arid Nevada desert climate. Displacement of these tribes and changes of lifestyle did not take place until the development of European settlements.

The first European settlements in Nevada were the 1851 settlements at Mormon Station (now Genoa) and at the mouth of Gold Canyon (Dayton), both in the Carson River Watershed. In the 1850s and 1860s, the river was used as the route of the Carson Trail, a branch of the California Trail that allowed access to the California gold fields, as well as by the Pony Express. Gold was discovered along the river in the Silver Mountain Mining District in 1860. 1868 Virginia and Truckee Railroad transported ore to the quartz reduction mines along the river. Virginia City, Nevada, along the lower watershed, was home to the world&#x27;s greatest silver rush, the Comstock Lode in 1859. The Carson Valley provided food and forage for the silver miners and their livestock. The Comstock mining boom critically impacted the watershed and water quality by causing deforested slopes, mine tailings, and steep raw riverbanks above channels cut into the valley floor in many places. These mining operations have also led to high levels of existing mercury concentrations within the watershed.

In the early 20th century, the Newlands Reclamation Act was passed to bring irrigation water into the region for agriculture. The Lahontan Dam, completed in 1914, was constructed as part of the Newlands Irrigation Project. The Truckee-Carson Irrigation District was formed in 1918 as part of the project to divert water from the Truckee River to the Carson Valley for agricultural use.

In 1989, the East Fork Carson River was designated a &quot;Wild and Scenic River&quot; by the State of California from Hangman&#x27;s Bridge just east of Markleeville, California to the CA/NV border, prohibiting any further consideration of impoundment.

==Watershed==
The Carson River watershed encompasses and includes two major forks in the Sierra Nevada in its upper watershed region. The East Fork rises on the north slopes of Sonora Peak (itself just north of Sonora Pass at about in southern Alpine County, southeast of Markleeville in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. The West Fork rises in the Sierras near Carson Pass and Lost Lakes at elevation and flows northeast into Nevada, joining the East Fork about southeast of Genoa. The Carson River then flows north to the end of the upper watershed at Mexican Dam just southeast of Carson City. In the middle watershed, the river runs generally northeast from Carson City across Lyon County, past Dayton. The middle watershed ends in eastern Churchill County at the Lahontan Dam. Here, river flows are augmented by water from the Truckee River and stored in the Lake Lahontan reservoir. Downstream from the dam (in the lower watershed), much of the water is used for irrigation in the vicinity of Fallon, with limited flows continuing northeast into the Carson Sink.

Clear Creek, which begins at about on Snow Valley Peak (Toiyabe National Forest, Carson Range) west of Carson City, is the only perennial tributary of the Carson River mainstem, and is protected by the Nature Conservancy.

== Carson River mercury superfund site ==
The Carson River basin, from New Empire to Stillwater and the Carson Sink, was designated as National Priority Listed (NPL) due to historic mining activity site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) in August 1990. This is Nevada&#x27;s only NPL site and is being jointly managed by NDEP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 9 (EPA), Region IX, in San Francisco. Millions of pounds of mercury were imported and used in approximately 250 Comstock mills to recover gold and silver. An estimated 14,000,000 pounds of mercury was lost to the environment during that process. Arsenic and lead, which were common constituents of the mined ore, were concentrated by the milling process and were also released into the environment. Therefore, the contaminants of concern (CoCs) at the site are mercury, arsenic, and lead.

Mercury, arsenic, and lead are known or suspected carcinogens (cancer-causing agents) and/or detrimental to human health in some other way. Mercury is the primary concern regarding the Carson River Mercury Superfund site. Several forms of mercury are prevalent in the open water source, including inorganic mercury (Hg2+) and organic methylmercury (MeHg). MeHg is produced from bacteria in river systems and can be ingested by the wildlife in the area. The methylmercury, due to its specific properties that include it being fat soluble, can lead to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of mercury in Carson River Aquatic wildlife. The contaminants, however, need a route into the human body to have a harmful effect. Direct contact with soils and subsequent ingestion and/or eating fish and waterfowl taken from the CRMS area, which may have already ingested CoCs, provide the most likely route into the body. Small children have the highest risk due to developing bodies and their propensity for ingesting soil while at play. Signs of Mercury poisoning due to oral ingestion are most commonly found to affect kidneys, central nervous system, and development - especially in organic mercury. The EPA and other scientists studied residents of contaminated areas and found no direct evidence of increased metals in blood, hair and urine samples. They did find elevated levels in certain fish and waterfowl. Some of the highest levels in the nation. Human health, if impacted, would be impacted slowly, over years of small amounts of exposure, and could be hard to detect.

The upland (dry-land) contamination source area of the CRMS. OU-1 is undergoing continued management and monitoring to assure public protection from mine wastes. The most significant health risk in OU-1 is direct contact and ingestion of contaminated soils. OU-2 is defined as the water, sediment, and biologic resources of the Carson River, Lahontan Reservoir, Washoe Lakes, Steamboat Creek, associated irrigation ditches, and the Stillwater Wildlife Refuge. EPA Contractor and USGS are continuing studies of OU-2 areas and will produce a (RI/FS). The most significant health risk posed by mercury in OU-2 is the consumption of fish and waterfowl from affected lake and river systems. In the 1990s, the EPA compelled several limited area cleanups to be completed by third parties and completed cleanup on a half dozen areas themselves. The cleanups occurred primarily in residential areas of Dayton. The remainder of the site has not undergone cleanup, and due to the size and scope of the area impacted, most likely never will. Since complete site cleanup is not economically viable. A long-term sampling and response plan (LTSRP) was developed to manage site contamination in the future. The LTSRP provides guidance for land development activities (both commercial and residential) to help assure site CoCs do not impact human health and the environment. Typically, soil sampling is required to verify developed area soils do not contain CoCs at levels which may cause harm to human health.

== Mercury amalgamation process ==
The Mercury in the Carson river is primarily introduced into the river through sediment deposition resulting from mine tailings during the Comstock Lode. These tailings were attributed to the mining process that settlers used in the 1850s to recover silver and gold. This process is known as mercury amalgamation. Mercury amalgamation has been mining precious metals since the Middle Ages. Mercury amalgamation is accomplished by pulverizing the ore and covering it with mercury using drums or tables. Once the mercury binds to the gold or silver, it is separated from the barren soil to a retorting vessel where the mercury is vaporized and condensed off of the amalgam. During the Comstock Lode a new, Washoe &quot;hot-pan&quot; amalgamation, the process was created specifically to treat Nevada ore in 1861. Washoe &quot;hot pan&quot; mining used a cast iron pan with the soil mixture, mercury, sulfuric acid, and other materials to remove the precious metals.

Losses of mercury that attributed to the contamination of the Carson River and eventually to the CRMS occurred during these processes. Mercury loss in the mining operations ranged from transportation failures, crude equipment, and poor handling. The mercury was transferred using leather bags, pails, and barrels that leaked and spilled. Equipment was not up to standards and not practical for containing tailings. However, most of the mercury loss happened throughout the amalgam process. The recovery amount of the vaporized mercury completely depends on the technology used, and the efficiency of mercury binding depends on the ability of the precious metal. Both of the actions were not completely refined themselves and attributed to as much as 0.7–1 kg of mercury waste/ per tonne of ore processed in Nevada mines.

Hydraulic mining was also used in the Carson River region. Hydraulic mining uses mercury to bond to the gold and silver in the mining slurry. The gold/silver amalgam drops to the bottom of the sluice while gravel and other tailings pass over. As time passes, the mercury is ground into a fine layer that coats the bottom of the sluice and can contaminate the surrounding area through leaks and the effluent of water containing the mercury. It is estimated that this practice in California attributed to mercury losses up to 10-30%.  

==Ecology==

In the lower reaches of the Carson River watershed, the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge hosts large breeding colonies of white-faced ibis (&quot;Plegadis chihi&quot;) and is frequented by non-breeding American white pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus erythrorhynchos&quot;). In winter, the refuge supports wintering tundra swans (&quot;Cygnus columbianus&quot;) as well as hosts of ducks and geese. The Carson River watershed also provides habitat for many smaller species of birds such as tree swallows (&quot;Tachycineta bicolor&quot;) and house wrens (&quot;Troglodytes aedon).&quot; Recent research on these two bird species has shown significant mercury concentrations in the livers and eggshells of the birds nesting along the river.

The upper Carson River watershed provides habitat for the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;), as well as large non-native rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) and brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;), providing excellent fly fishing. The Lahontan cutthroat is threatened by hybridization with rainbow trout, but there is a pure Lahontan strain on of the East Fork Carson River from the headwaters to Carson Falls. There is also a native population of the only Paiute cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki seleniris&quot;) in existence in the drainages of Silver King Creek, a tributary of the East Fork Carson River in the Carson Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.

North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) were re-introduced to the Carson River watershed around 1940 and have thrived since. There are eyewitness accounts of beaver in the upper Carson River through 1892. The Washo people who lived in the eastern Sierra with hunting grounds extending as far west as Calaveras County, have a word for beaver, &quot;c&#x27;imhélhel&quot;. Powers reported that the northern Paiute wrapped their hair in strips of beaver fur, made medicine from parts of beaver and that their creation legend included beaver, which they called &quot;su-i&#x27;-tu-ti-kut&#x27;-teh&quot;. Given the hydrological connection of the Humboldt River and Sink to the Carson Sink during flood years (as recently as 1998), it is not surprising that beavers were historically extant on eastern Sierra watercourses. Peter Skene Ogden, on a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company expedition to the terminus of the Humboldt River, wrote in his diary on May 15, 1829, &quot;In no part have I found beaver so abundant. The total number of American trappers in this region at this time exceeds 80. I have only 28 trappers... The trappers now average 125 beaver a man and are greatly pleased with their success.&quot; James &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams trapped beaver in the Carson River around 1860, &quot;In the evening we caught a fine lot of salmon-trout (cutthroat trout), using grasshoppers for bait, and in the night killed half a dozen beavers, which were very tame.&quot; Adams&#x27; account is consistent with a 1906 newspaper article in the Nevada State Journal that the Mason&#x27;s Valley of the nearby Walker River in Yerington, Nevada was well known to &quot;the early trappers and fur hunters...Kit Carson knew it to the bone...The beavers of course were all trapped long ago, and you never see an elk nowadays...&quot;

== Environmental impact ==
During the Comstock Lode mining operations (1860–1890), extensive amount of Mercury (Hg) was released into the Carson River, Lahontan Reservoir, and Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge. The mercury levels in the Carson River and Lahontan Reservoir vary from 100-1000 ng/L, which is considered highly toxic. The surrounding wildlife has been exposed to this contamination and has been subject to negative effects. These organomercurials readily bioaccumulate and affect the predators in this ecosystem with the greatest mercury concentration. An example of this bioaccumulation has been researched in fish-eating birds along the river. The species involved in the study were adult double-crested cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax auritus&quot;), snowy egrets (&quot;Egretta thula&quot;) and black-crowned night-herons (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;), which all recorded high levels of Hg toxicity in their kidneys and livers. Concentrations of Hg were also observed in eggs and fledglings, but were found not to affect the hatchability of the eggs. Rather, the levels of mercury observed in fledglings have led to induced stress, immune deficiencies, and neurological impairment, which could lead to a decrease in survival rates for younger birds learning to survive along the Carson River.

Many fish species in the Carson River also have been studied to check for mercury contamination. In one study, electrofishing was conducted at four different locations along the river to capture and sample fish for traces of Hg toxicity. Carp, golden shiners, species of sucker-fish, and crayfish all showed Hg toxicity in samples taken from the four testing sites. This study also showed that many samples taken from the fourth, and furthest down the river system, produced higher levels of Hg contamination, suggesting that the mercury has been getting washed down the Carson River and accumulating at the Lahontan Reservoir. White bass,a piscivorous species in Lahontan Reservoir, are subject to the bioaccumulation of Hg contamination, and have showed mercury concentration significantly higher to that catfish species found in the reservoir due to difference in diet. Research has shown that the concentrations of mercury vary dependent on species, diet, and size of the individual fish, and that currently the fish found in the reservoir are considered safe, but not recommended, for human consumption.

== Recreation ==
The Carson River is a trophy trout stream that offers ideal conditions for both fly and spinning anglers. Further up in the river system anglers can fish for various species of trout, such as the previously mentioned Lahontan Cutthroat, Rainbow, and Brown trout. Down the river system the ecosystem changes to a warm water environment, and the fish species change accordingly.

Backcountry hiking is found along the upper river in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. Kayakers and river rafters enjoy the lower river&#x27;s gentle class II rapids, as well as its outstanding scenery and river-side hot springs. The East Carson has extensive Native American cultural values associated with the Washoe tribe. The watershed is also a popular recreation spot for mountain biking, off-roading, hunting, and horse-back riding. Development along the river in Douglas, Carson City, and Lyon counties has limited public access in some areas.

<doc id="699135" wikidata="Q3138074" url="?curid=699135" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Greece">
<text>Greece&#x27;s first postal service was founded in 1828, at the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. This initial service continued mail delivery and, later, the issuing of postage stamps until 1970. It was then succeeded by the Hellenic Post S.A. (abbreviated ΕΛΤΑ), which remains Greece&#x27;s official postal provider. The first Greek stamps (known as &quot;Large Hermes heads&quot;) were issued in 1861; by then, the postal service had expanded to operate 97 branches. Until 1966, with the exception of a set issued in 1927, all Greek stamps were simply inscribed ΕΛΛΑΣ (Hellas, the country&#x27;s Greek name). From 1966 to 1982, the inscription was modified to include both the Greek and Latin versions: ΕΛΛΑΣ-HELLAS. Beginning in 1982, ΕΛΛΑΣ was replaced with ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ (Hellenic Republic); this inscription is still being used on Greek stamps. It was also used on the 1927 set referred to earlier.

In 1875, Greece was among the founding members of the General Postal Union (renamed the Universal Postal Union in 1878).

Greece&#x27;s territory and population was greatly expanded by the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars; it acquired some additional territory during World War I. This led to the issuing of several sets of occupation stamps, which consisted of both existing stamp issues with overprints and newly printed issues. In addition to these, some of the so-called &quot;New Territories&quot;, notably the islands of Ikaria and Samos, issued their own stamps prior to becoming part of Greece.

Beginning with the Olympic issue of 1896, Greece has issued a number of commemorative stamps. Their subjects have included Greek history, art, mythology and wildlife.

==Classic period (1859–1902)==

===Ionian Islands (1859–1864)===
The first Greek-inscribed stamps were not issued by Greece proper, but by the nearby Ionian Islands. Under British rule from 1815 to 1864, this island group was known as the &quot;United States of the Ionian Islands&quot;. A set of three stamps was issued on 15 May 1859. Printed by Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co. of London and inscribed ΙΟΝΙΚΟΝ ΚΡΑΤΟΣ (Ionian State), they depicted a profile of Queen Victoria. All were imperforate and bore no face value, this being indicated by their colors; orange (½ penny), blue (1 penny) and lake (2 pence). These stamps became invalid after the Ionian Islands were ceded to Greece on 28 June 1864.

===Large Hermes heads (1861–1888)===
The first stamps of Greece were the so-called &quot;Large Hermes heads&quot;, depicting a profile of the Greek messenger god Hermes in a frame strongly resembling that used for contemporary stamps of France. The basic design was by the French engraver Albert Désiré Barre and the first batch was printed in Paris by Ernst Meyer. The first set was issued on 1 October 1861. It consisted of seven denominations (1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 lepta). In November 1861 the printing plates were transferred to Athens and subsequent printings made there. The plates continued in use into the mid-1880s, resulting in a number of varieties due to plates becoming worn and then cleaned, as well as the printing of the stamps on several kinds of paper. Most types were also printed with control numbers on the back, and all were imperforate. Additional denominations (30 and 60 lepta) were introduced in 1876, to comply with the General Postal Union&#x27;s international letter rates (30 lepta for basic, 60 for registered letters).

===Postage due stamps (1875–1902)===
The first postage due stamps of Greece were issued in 1875. The first batch was printed in Vienna, as were further releases in 1876 and 1890-1893. Green to yellow-green in color, with numerals declaring each stamp&#x27;s value along with the inscription ειοπρακτέον(-α) (postage due(s)) inside a central circle, these stamps are known as &quot;rologakia&quot; (little clocks). The first two sets consisted of twelve values; 1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 drachmae. The third contained only the 1 lepton, 2, 5, 40 and 60 lepta. The stamps were issued with a variety of perforations: 9, 9½, 10, 10½ and compound.

A second design, with its inscription contained in a scroll pattern in place of the circle, was issued in 1902. Known as the London issue, it was printed by Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co., with engraving by the Johnstonia Engraving Company. These stamps had perforations of 13½. In place of the earlier issues&#x27; 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta values, the London issue introduced new denominations of 3, 25, 30 and 50 lepta; it also dropped the 2 drachmae value. With only minor changes, this design has been used on all Greek postage due stamps since.

===Small Hermes heads (1886–1900)===
In 1883, Greece&#x27;s postal service reduced its international letter rates to 25 and 50 lepta (for basic and registered letters respectively). This, as well as the need for a new 1 drachma value to cover parcel post services, led to the issue of a new set of stamps. This set, the &quot;Small Hermes heads&quot;, first appeared in 1886. The first batch was printed in Malines, Belgium followed by numerous reprints in Athens until 1900. Like their predecessors, they depicted Hermes in profile, but with a smaller head and a rounder helmet. Initially the sheets were imperforate. Perforated versions, initially 13½ and later 11½, became available in 1891. The denominations were 1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, and 50 lepta and 1 drachma.

In September 1900 some of the small Hermes head stamps (blue 25 lepta and violet 40 lepta) were surcharged with different values (20 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 drachmae) due to the delay in printing the new Flying Mercury issue.

===1896 Olympic issue===

Greece&#x27;s first commemorative stamps were issued in 1896 for the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first Olympic games in modern times. The series consisted of twelve values (1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40 and 60 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 5 and 10 drachmae). There were eight different designs, by Professor I. Svoronos, which included famous sports-related images from ancient Greece, such as a chariot race and Myron&#x27;s &quot;Discobolus&quot;. The stamps were designed by Swiss artist A. Guilleron, the steel dies were created by the French engraver Louis-Eugène Mouchon and printing took place at the National Printing Office of France. The name &quot;E. MOUCHON&quot; appears at the bottom side of each stamp. The stamps were delivered in perforated sheets (13½ x 14). They were at first meant to be sold only during the Games, but their circulation period was extended; first to March 1897, then until they were sold out. The 1896 Olympics stamps, of which the 5 and 10 drachmae denominations are relatively rare, remain popular with collectors of topical stamps relating to sports and Olympic games.
===A M overprints (1900–1901)===
In 1900 and 1901, a variety of existing Greek stamps (Large Hermes heads, Small Hermes heads and 1896 Olympics) were surcharged in black or red with new values and also with the letters &quot;A M&quot;, standing for the Greek words &quot;Αξία Μεταλλική&quot; (&quot;Axia Metalliki&quot; or &quot;value in (gold) metal&quot;), meaning that the face values were based on the gold standard of the Latin Monetary Union. These stamps were sold at the post offices at a price higher than the face value, due to the depreciation of the drachma. The &quot;A M&quot; stamps were mainly used for international parcel post and postal money orders, although they are sometimes found on normal letter covers. In 1902 these stamps were withdrawn and replaced with the &quot;A M&quot; series.

==Early 20th century (1901–1911)==

===Flying Mercury and A M issues (1901–1902)===

In 1901, a new series of definitive stamps was issued, replacing the small Hermes heads and the overprints of 1900. The new stamps depicted Giovanni da Bologna&#x27;s statue of Hermes/Mercury (c. 1564). The series included fourteen denominations in three different designs: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3 and 5 drachmae. The high values of this series are notable for being printed in metallic colors; bronze (2d), silver (3d), and gold (5d). The stamps were printed on two qualities of paper (thick and thin) with watermark &quot;ET&quot; and crown. The sheets were delivered with perforation 13½ for the low values and 11½ for the high values, although small quantities were delivered with different perforations.

In 1902 an additional series of five stamps was issued, depicting the head of the same statue. These stamps were in values of gold currency and inscribed &quot;A M&quot; for &quot;Αξία Μεταλλική&quot; (&quot;Axia Metalliki&quot; or &quot;value in metal&quot;). They replaced the provisional &quot;A M&quot; overprints of 1900-1901 for international parcel post and money orders. The series was printed by Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co. on thick paper, watermarked with &quot;ET&quot; and crown and delivered with perforation 13½. These stamps were also used briefly as revenue stamps in 1913.

The 1901–1902 issues remained in regular use until 1911.

===1906 Olympic issue===
Commemorative issue for the 1906 Intercalated Games. This set of stamps was printed by Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co. and issued on 25 March 1906. It consisted of fourteen denominations (1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3 and 5 drachmae). Special commemorative cancellations were used during the Games at Zappeion (&quot;ΖΑΠΠΕΙΟΝ&quot;), Stadium (&quot;ΣΤΑΔΙΟΝ&quot;) and Acropolis (&quot;ΑΚΡΟΠΟΛΙΣ&quot;) provisional post offices. The 1906 Olympics stamps were never withdrawn and can be found with postmarks dated until 1910. They were also overprinted for use as revenue stamps.

===1911 Engraved issue===
In 1911, a new series of definitive stamps was issued to replace the Flying Mercury set. There were four different designs, by I. Svoronos (who had designed the 1896 Olympic issue) and G. Jakovides, which depicted Hermes and the rainbow goddess Iris. The set consisted of sixteen values (1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae). It would become known as the &quot;Engraved issue&quot;. The plates were engraved by Thomas McDonald (UK) and printing was done by the firm Gerasimos Aspiotis Bros. of Corfu. The sheets were delivered on unwatermarked paper with perforation 13½.

The 3, 5 and 10 drachmae stamps from this set were re-issued in 1921 with slightly altered dimensions, measuring 20½ x 25½ mm.; the original issue measured 20½ x 26½ mm.

== Territorial expansion (1912–1923) ==

===General issue ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ (1912–1913)===

Greece&#x27;s borders were greatly expanded by the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 as it occupied Macedonia including the city of Thessaloniki, parts of Epirus and Thrace and various Aegean islands, as well as formally annexing Crete. Until these so-called &quot;New Territories&quot; were formally incorporated into Greece, they were not permitted to use regular Greek stamps. In order to cover postal needs in these areas, Greece&#x27;s government ordered existing stamps to be overprinted with ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ (Hellenic Administration) until a planned 1912 issue became available. A special overprint, ΛΗΜΝΟΣ, was also ordered for use on the island of Lemnos, which was occupied in October 1912. These overprints, in three different colors (black, red and carmine), were applied to the 1911 &quot;Engraved&quot; definitives, the 20 lepta Flying Mercury stamp, the 1902 postage due stamps and some of the 1913 &quot;Lithographic&quot; definitives. This issue went through several printings, initially by Aspiotis Bros. and later by the Aquarone printing house of Thessaloniki. The overprints normally read from the bottom of the stamp to the top; due to misplacement of sheets in the printing press, some were released with the overprint reading from top to bottom.

A variation of this overprint, consisting of the letters &quot;Ε.*Δ&quot; in red, was employed on the island of Chios in 1913. This was applied locally to a quantity of 25 lepta stamps from the ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ issue which were mistakenly delivered without the overprint.

===Campaign issue and Souda Bay issue (1913)===

A set of sixteen stamps was issued in April 1913, to replace the provisional ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ and ΛΗΜΝΟΣ overprints in territories under Greek military occupation. Two designs were used, depicting Constantine the Great&#x27;s vision and the Eagle of Zeus; this set would become known as the &quot;Campaign issue&quot;. It consisted of the following values: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae. It was printed by Aspiotis Bros. using the lithographic process. The stamps were printed on two types of paper, smooth and rough, with perforation 13½. These stamps were occasionally also used in Greece proper.
In 1916, certain values of the Campaign issue were overprinted with Ι. Κοινότης Αγ. Όρους (Holy Community of Mount Athos). Intended for local use in the Mount Athos area, these overprinted stamps were never put into circulation; most of them were burned in the 1930s. There were two types of overprint; horizontal (applied to the 1 lepton, 2, 3, and 15 lepta and 2 drachmae values) and vertical (applied to the 20 lepta).

A 25 lepta commemorative stamp was issued on 1 December 1913 for use only by Cretan post offices. This stamp depicts the 1 May 1913 raising of the Greek flag on Souda Island, marking the annexation of Crete to the Kingdom of Greece. It was printed by Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co. of London with perforation 14½. It remained in circulation for only one year.

===Lithographic issue (1913–1923)===

The First Balkan War, and the new territory it brought Greece, led to an increase in demand for definitive stamps. The increased demand, combined with a wartime money shortage, led the Greek government to seek the least expensive means of producing stamps in large quantities. It was decided to re-print the existing definitives using lithography; the resulting set is known as the &quot;Lithographic issue&quot;. Also printed by Aspiotis Bros., the sheets were delivered on unwatermarked paper with perforation 13½. The eighteen values in this set were not issued all at once, but ranged in date from 1913 to 1923, as follows: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 25 lepta (1913); 15 lepta (1918); 30, 40 and 50 lepta (1914); 80 lepta (1923); 1 drachma, 2 drachmae (1919); 3 drachmae (1920); 5, 10 and 25 drachmae (1922).

The 25 and 40 lepta and 1 drachma values from this set were re-issued in 1926, printed in Vienna using new plates.

===Ikaria, Mytilene and Samos (1912–1915)===
The Aegean islands of Ikaria and Samos successfully rebelled against Ottoman rule shortly before the First Balkan War, in July and September 1912 respectively. The former was declared the &quot;Free State of Ikaria&quot; by a provisional government, which proceeded to issue its own stamps. These were printed by Stangel &amp; Co. in Athens and issued in October 1912. They were inscribed ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΑ ΠΟΛΙΤΕΙΑ ΙΚΑΡΙΑΣ (Free State of Ikaria) and depicted Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. The values in this set of eight consisted of 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 and 5 drachmae. Ikaria was occupied by Greek forces in November 1912, after which overprinted Greek stamps replaced the local issue.

Though the revolutionary government on Samos wished to become part of Greece, this did not happen until late 1914 when a General Administrator was sent from Athens to take charge. In the meantime, the Samian government issued several sets of stamps. The first, issued on 14 November 1912, was a set of three depicting a map of Samos with the inscription ΠΡΟΣΩΡΙΝΟΝ ΤΑΧΥΔΡΟΜΕΙΟΝ ΣΑΜΟΥ (Provisional Post Office of Samos). All were imperforate and printed locally by hand. The second, depicting a profile of Hermes, was printed by Stangel &amp; Co. and released in two batches. The first batch, issued on 26 November, consisted of five values (1 lepton, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta) with perforation 11½; the second, issued on 22 December, was overprinted with ΕΛΛΑΣ in boldface type. It included the values from the first batch plus a 1 drachma value. This would be known as the &quot;Large ΕΛΛΑΣ&quot; overprint to distinguish it from a second, thinner overprint applied in February 1914 (the &quot;Thin ΕΛΛΑΣ&quot;). A third set, the &quot;castles&quot; issue, was released on 4 January 1913. Consisting of five values (1 drachma, 2, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae), it commemorated both an 1824 Greek victory over the Ottoman Empire at Gerontas Bay and the 1912 vote for union with Greece. The stamps were printed at the shop of lithographer O.K. Travlos in Vathy and signed ΘΣ, the initials of Samian president Themistoklis Sophoulis. Red ink was used for the signatures on all values except the 25 drachmae, on which black ink was used. An illustrated postal card was issued along with the Hermes set; printed on one side was the 5 lepta value from that set and the Greek coat of arms, the other side depicted Vathy palace and portraits of Sophoulis and Lykourgos Logothetis, the island&#x27;s leader in the Greek War of Independence. All issues were replaced by the ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ and Campaign stamps when Greece assumed control of Samos. In December 1914 some of the Hermes and &quot;castles&quot; stamps were re-issued as charity stamps, with the overprint Γενική Διοίκησις Σάμου (General Administration of Samos).

Mytilene was occupied by Greek forces near the end of 1912. Turkish stamps were seized from the main post office and overprinted with Ελληνική Κατοχή Μυτιλήνης (&quot;Greek Occupation of Mytilene&quot;). This overprint was applied at the print shop of the newspaper &quot;Salpinx&quot; (&quot;Trumpet&quot;). Since there was no Greek currency available on Mytilene at the time, the overprinted stamps retained their value in Turkish paras and piastres.

===Greek Occupation of Thrace (1913, 1920)===
During the Second Balkan War, several cities in Thrace came under Greek occupation. Overprinted stamps were subsequently issued for the Thracian cities of Dedeagatch (July 1913) and Giumulzina (August 1913). In the former, a three-line overprint reading ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ ΔΕΔΕΑΓΑΤΣ (Hellenic Administration of Dedeagatch) along with new values was applied to stamps of Bulgaria. This was followed by three sets of locally printed stamps, one in July and two in September 1913. Printed on three different colors of paper (white, yellow and blue), they were inscribed ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΙΟΙΚΗΣΙΣ ΔΕΔΕΑΓΑΤΣ with values at the bottom. The September issues bore the added inscription ΠΡΟΣΩΡΙΝΟΝ (Provisional). In the latter, the overprint ΕΛΛ. ΔΙΟΙΚ. ΓΚΙΟΥΜΟΥΛΤΖΙΝΑΣ (Hellenic Administration of Giumulzina) in blue and red was applied to Turkish stamps along with new values (10 and 25 lepta). Both cities were returned to Bulgaria after the war.

In 1920, after World War I, Greece regained control of western Thrace. The Greek occupying authorities issued three sets of stamps for use in the region: stamps from the &quot;Engraved&quot;, &quot;Lithographic&quot; and 1916 &quot;ET&quot; issues overprinted with Διοίκησις Δυτικής Θράκης (Administration of Western Thrace), released in May 1920; Turkish stamps overprinted with Υπάτη Αρμοστεία Θράκης (High Commission of Thrace) and new values, released in July 1920; and Greek stamps from the three sets listed above, overprinted with Διοίκησις Θράκης and released the same year.

===Royal Government ET issue (1916)===
During World War I, Greece was divided over the question of joining the Entente Powers or staying neutral (the National Schism). In October 1916 a pro-Entente group formed a separate, provisional government in Thessaloniki, led by Eleftherios Venizelos. The Athens government, to prevent them from using stamps already in circulation, ordered those stamps to be overprinted with the letters &quot;ET&quot; and the Greek crown. This overprint was applied to stamps from the &quot;Engraved&quot; and &quot;Lithographic&quot; sets, which were then issued on 1 November 1916.

===Thessaloniki Provisional Government issue (1917)===
In response to the &quot;ET&quot; overprints, Venizelos&#x27; Provisional Government ordered the engraving and printing of a new set of stamps from Perkins, Bacon and Co. Their design was based on the Iris stamps from the 1911 issue, with the additional inscription ΠΡΟΣΩΡΙΝΗ ΚΥΒΕΡΝΗΣΙΣ (Provisional Government). The set was lithographed on porous paper, with a perforation of 14½. It consisted of eleven values: 1 lepton, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae. A 4 drachmae value was also printed, but was only used as a revenue stamp.

== 1920s and 1930s ==

=== 1922 Revolution overprints (1923) ===
In May 1923, the overprint ΕΠΑΝΑΣΤΑΣΙΣ 1922 (Revolution of 1922) was applied to existing stamps of Crete and Greece, including the 1913 Campaign and 1917 Provisional Government issues. The overprint was in commemoration of the 1922 Revolution which led to the second abdication of King Constantine I, and was applied at the National Printing House in Athens.

=== Definitive issues ===
A new set of definitive stamps was issued on 1 April 1927. Its fourteen values (5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, and 80 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae) depicted various landscapes and costumes of Greece, such as the Corinth Canal and the White Tower of Thessaloniki; therefore it was known as the &quot;Landscapes set&quot;. A 1 lepton value was printed but never issued. The printing plates were manufactured by the firm Thomas McDonald of London and printing took place at Aspiotis Bros. Several later issues were intended to supplement this set; the 1933 Republic set (50, 75 and 100 drachmae), the 1934 Athens Stadium stamp (8 drachmae) and the 1935 Mystras stamp (4 drachmae). Between 1931 and 1935, the 50 lepta, 1 drachma, and 2, 3, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae values were re-issued. The set was withdrawn from circulation in 1939.

A further definitive issue was released in the late 1930s. Known as the &quot;Historical issue&quot;, it was issued in three phases. Its first phase, issued on 1 November 1937, was a set of four stamps which depicted King George II, including values of 1 drachma and 3, 8 and 100 drachmae. The 3 drachmae value represented the domestic postal rate, and the 8 drachmae value the international postal rate. On 1 November 1937 the second phase, devoted to &quot;Themes from the evolution of the Greek civilization&quot;, was issued. It consisted of thirteen values (5, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 80 lepta and 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae) depicting important works of art and episodes in Greek history, such as the Venus de Milo, the Battle of Salamis and St. Paul preaching in Athens. The third phase was issued on 8 October 1938 to commemorate the unveiling of a statue of King Constantine I in Athens; it depicted that statue and consisted of two values (1.5 and 30 drachmae).

The &quot;Historical issue&quot; was withdrawn from circulation in 1941 (the King George and King Constantine issues) and 1943 (the Greek civilization set).

=== Early airmail stamps (1926–1939) ===

Greece&#x27;s first airmail stamps, known as the &quot;Patagonia set&quot;, were released in mid-October 1926. They were intended for use on airmail letters from Greece to Italy and Turkey, and produced by the Italian firm Aero Espresso Italiana (AEI). The design, by A. Gavalas, depicted flying boats against various backgrounds. The set was printed in Milan, Italy, reputedly by the firm Bestetti &amp; Tumminelli, and consisted of four values (2, 3, 5 and 10 drachmae). This issue remained in circulation until 1933, when it was replaced by the zeppelin and &quot;Aeroespresso&quot; issues, also produced by AEI.

The zeppelin issue, consisting of three values (30, 100 and 120 drachmae), was issued 2 May 1933 and remained on sale until 27 May. It was released in connection with the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin&#x27;s 29 May flight to Rome and depicted a zeppelin flying over the Acropolis of Athens.

Its successor, the &quot;Aeroespresso set&quot;, was released on 10 October 1933; its designs depicted flight-related themes. It was printed by Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co. of London and consisted of seven values (50 lepta, 1 drachma, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 drachmae). This set remained in circulation until 1935.

All unsold stamps from these three sets were returned to AEI, who then placed them on the philatelic market.

On 2 November 1933 the Greek government, in conjunction with the Hellenic Aerial Communications Company, issued its own set of airmail stamps for general use. The plates were produced by Thomas De La Rue (UK) and the printing was done by Aspioti-ELKA. This set, depicting airplanes over various locations in Greece, consisted of seven values (50 lepta, 1 drachma, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 drachmae).

After the &quot;Aeroepresso&quot; set was withdrawn from circulation in 1935, Greece issued a new set of nine airmail stamps. Called the &quot;Mythological issue&quot;, its designs, by M. Biskinis, depicted figures from ancient Greek mythology like Daedalus, Icarus, Helios and Athena. As with the first government issue, the plates were produced by Thomas De La Rue and the printing done by Aspioti ELKA. It was released on 10 November 1935 and consisted of nine values (1 drachma, 2, 5, 7, 10, 25, 30, 50 and 100 drachmae). Due to vast growth in airmail correspondence in the mid-to-late 1930s, several values of this set (1 drachma, 2, 5, 7 and 10 drachmae) were re-issued in 1937 and 1939.

== World War II (1940–1945)==

===Definitive issues===
In April–May 1941, Greece came under Axis occupation, which lasted until October 1944. During this time, regular Greek stamps continued to be issued. A new definitive set depicting Greek landscapes including the Meteora monasteries and Aspropotamos River, intended to replace the 1937 &quot;Historical issue&quot;, was released in two batches of nine. The first was issued in 1942 and consisted of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 drachmae values. Due to vastly increasing inflation later in the occupation period, the second batch, issued in 1944, bore higher values ranging from 500 to 5,000,000 drachmae. This set remained in circulation until 11 November 1944. On that date, to accompany a post-occupation money reform, three stamps from the &quot;Historical&quot; set (the 50 lepta and 2 and 5 drachmae values) were issued with the overprint ΔΡΑΧΜΑΙ ΝΕΑΙ (New Drachmae). The new exchange rate was fixed at 50 billion old drachmae to 1 new drachma. In May 1945, the 6 drachma &quot;Historical&quot; value was issued with the same overprint.

In 1945 a new set of eight definitives, the &quot;Glory issue&quot;, was released. Intended to cover regular mail, airmail and international parcel post as well as replace the ΔΡΑΧΜΑΙ ΝΕΑΙ set, it included values of 1 drachma, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 drachmae and was perforated 12½ x 13½. This set was named for its depiction of Nikolaos Gysis&#x27; painting &quot;The Glory of Psara&quot;.

During the occupation, Greek airmail was limited to two domestic routes; Athens-Thessaloniki and Athens-Heraklion. Foreign destinations were likewise restricted to Germany, Italy and certain Axis-occupied countries. At first, Greek postage due stamps were converted for airmail use by being overprinted with a small airplane design in red. However, these sold out rather quickly, creating the need for a new issue. A set of six values (2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 drachmae) with designs by O. Perivolarakis depicting various Anemoi, or wind gods, was released on 15 August 1942. This set was re-printed in 1943, with three existing values (10, 25 and 50 drachmae) in different colors from the originals and three new values (100, 200 and 400 drachmae). Inflation rendered these stamps useless for mailing by April 1944; they were withdrawn from circulation in July. In the meantime, the use of regular stamps to cover airmail rates was allowed.

===Semi-postal stamps===
Greece&#x27;s first semi-postal stamps were produced during the occupation. The first, a set of three, was issued on 3 October 1943. It consisted of the following values and designs; 25 + 25 drachmae (portrait of a child), 100 + 50 drachmae (portrait of a mother and baby) and 200 + 100 drachmae (portrait of the Virgin Mary and infant Christ). Use of these stamps was mandatory on domestic mail through that month; proceeds from their sale went toward the Patriotic Charity and Awareness Institution Fund, for use in children&#x27;s welfare programs. A second semi-postal set of ten, consisting of 1942 definitives and 1944 airmail issues surcharged with ΒΟΜΒΑΡΔΙΣΜΟΣ ΠΕΙΡΑΙΩΣ 11-1-1944 ΔΡ. 100.000 (Bombardment of Piraeus 11-1-1944 dr. 100,000), was issued on 11 June 1944. This set&#x27;s proceeds were used to aid the families of victims of the Allied bombardment of Piraeus in January 1944. It was withdrawn from circulation on 30 June 1944. On 20 July 1944 a third set, also of ten and again using definitive and airmail stamps, was released. Its overprint read ΠΑΙΔΙΚΑΙ ΕΞΟΧΑΙ ΔΡΧ. 50.000 + 450.000 (Children&#x27;s camps dr. 50,000 + 450,000); proceeds went toward the support of children&#x27;s camps. This set was withdrawn from circulation on 11 November 1944.

===National Resistance issues===
Resistance movements formed throughout Greece not long after its occupation. The two largest resistance groups, the National Liberation Front (E.A.M.) and the National Republican Greek League (E.D.E.S.), produced stamps for use in areas under their control - though few of them would actually be used postally.

E.A.M.&#x27;s single issue, a set of eight consisting of eight values (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000, 25000 and 40000 drachmae) inscribed ΕΛΕΥΘΕΡΗ ΕΛΛΑΔΑ (&quot;Free Greece&quot;), was produced on 25 February 1944. The set was never used, though some were cancelled with an E.A.M. handstamp.

E.D.E.S. produced three sets, only one of which saw postal use. The first two, a set of five (values 15, 25, 50, 100 and 200 drachmae) and a single stamp (1000 drachmae) inscribed Free Greece, were produced in 1943 and July 1944 respectively; all were imperforate. Almost all stamps from their second issue were confiscated by the occupying Germans. The third set, which unlike the others was perforated, was produced on 23 July. Issued to commemorate two years of E.D.E.S.&#x27; existence, it consisted of four values (2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 drachmae). It was not placed on sale until 25 November 1944. This date marked the second anniversary of the Resistance&#x27;s destruction of the Gorgopotamos railway bridge. To commemorate that event, the third E.D.E.S. issue was overprinted with ΓΟΡΓΟΠΟΤΑΜΟΣ 25-11-1942 (Gorgopotamos 25-11-1942) and placed on sale for one day at the Ioannina post office with the condition that they would be attached to a cover.

As Greece was gradually liberated from occupation in 1944, local overprints and new values on the 1942 definitives were used for mail in some of the newly freed areas; Lefkada, Lesbos, Agrinio and Preveza. Values on these overprinted issues ranged from 100,000 to 10,000,000 drachmae.

== Post-war definitive issues ==

In 1946-47 a new set of eighteen definitives, the &quot;chain surcharges&quot;, was issued. Stamps from the 1937 &quot;Historical issue&quot; and 1942 definitives and airmail stamps were surcharged in red or black with the design of a closed chain and new values. Since then, Greece has released over twenty definitive issues with subjects including its culture, landscapes, mythology and royalty. Examples include the Dodecanese union set (twenty-three values released between 1947 and 1951), the Marshall Plan set (six values, 1951), the National products set (seven values, 1953), the ancient art series (1954–55, 1958–60), the ancient coins series (1959, 1963), the tourist publicity set (seventeen values, 1961), the King Paul set (ten values, 1964), the labors of Hercules set (eleven values, 1970), the national costumes series (1972–74), the Homer&#x27;s epics set (fifteen values, 1983), the capitals of prefectures series (1988, 1990, 1992, 1994), the Greek dances set (2002) and the Greek islands series (2004, 2006).

Greece&#x27;s final set of airmail stamps, a set of seven depicting Greek harbors, was issued in 1958.

==Commemorative stamps==

Starting with the 1896 Olympic issue, Greece has issued a number of commemorative stamps. Subjects depicted include political and military leaders, athletic events, ancient and modern Greek culture, archaeological discoveries, and wildlife. The &quot;Anniversaries and events&quot; set of 15 March 1982 marked the first contemporary use of the ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ-HELLAS inscription. A brief survey of Greek commemoratives:

* Europa - Beginning in 1960, Greece has issued yearly commemoratives as part of the Europa stamp program. It used the common design through 1973; starting in 1974, it has issued stamps with Greek themes like the 1980 Europa issue depicting Giorgos Seferis and Maria Callas.
* Olympics - Also starting in 1960, commemorative sets have been issued in honor of each Olympic Games; a number of these were issued for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, including a set depicting Greek medal winners.

==Charity stamps==

Charity stamps benefiting various foundations were issued between 1914 and 1956. The first, a set of two from 1914 depicted the allegorical figure &quot;The Tragedy of War&quot;. Its values were 2 and 5 lepta; proceeds went to the National Welfare Foundation. Other early issues included a 5 lepta stamp for the Greek Women&#x27;s Patriotic League, released in 1915 and depicting the League&#x27;s badge, and several for the Red Cross Fund. Issued in 1915, 1918 and 1924, their designs included the Red Cross symbol along with nurses and wounded soldiers. The 1918 issue was also released with the overprint &quot;Π.Ι.Π.&quot; (Patriotic Relief Institution); proceeds went to the Greek Patriotic League.

During the National Schism of 1917, the Athens government ordered the surcharge &quot;K.Π.&quot; and new values applied to Flying Mercury, Campaign and revenue stamps. At first, this only applied to those parts of Greece they controlled; for a short time after the Schism ended, use of these surcharged stamps was extended to the whole country.

In 1939, a set of three (10 and 50 lepta and 1 drachma) which depicted Queens Olga and Sophia was released.

A number of charity stamps were produced to benefit postal workers; initially proceeds went to the Postal Clerks&#x27; Tuberculosis Fund, to aid postal workers suffering from that disease. Later, starting in 1946, they were applied to the Postal Clerks&#x27; Welfare Fund. The first issue, a set of three (10, 20 and 50 lepta) depicting the goddess Hygeia, was released in 1934. It was re-released in 1935, with the inscription ΕΛΛΑΣ added at the top of each stamp. Use of these stamps was obligatory on all mail during four weeks of the year, including Christmas, Easter and the New Year, and year-round on parcel post packages. The 50 lepta stamp from the 1935 set was re-issued in 1939 with different colors; in 1941, Hygeia stamps were released with a surcharge of 50 lepta. In addition, from 1940 to 1945, surcharges and new values were applied to stamps from the 1927 Landscapes set, the &quot;Historical issue&quot;, the 1939 charity set and 1942 definitives.

Other charity stamps included the Thessaloniki International Fair Fund issue, a 20 lepta stamp from 1934 which depicted St. Demetrius; its use was obligatory on domestic mail from Thessaloniki. It was re-issued with a 1 drachma surcharge in 1942. St. Demetrius was also depicted on a 50 drachmae charity stamp released in 1948; proceeds from its sale went toward the restoration of historic sites and churches destroyed during World War II.

Later issues included a 1953 set of two (300 and 500 drachmae) to raise funds for reconstruction in the Ionian Islands after an earthquake and a 1956 set of two (50 lepta and 1 drachma) for the Macedonian Studies Society Fund, to help finance archaeological studies in the region.

== Postal stationery ==

The first items of postal stationery to be issued by Greece were postcards in 1876, post paid envelopes and Lettercards were issued in 1894 followed by newspaper wrappers in 1901. Aerogrammes were first issued in 1967. Postcards and aerogrammes continue to be available to this day. The last issue of envelopes was in 1941. Three different values of newspaper wrappers were issued in 1901, in 1911 one new newspaper wrapper was issued and no further newspaper wrappers were issued after this date.

<text>Modern Lake Lahontan is a reservoir on the Carson River in northwest Nevada in the United States. It is formed by the Lahontan Dam, built in 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Newlands Reclamation Act and is located between Fallon, Nevada and Carson City, Nevada. The flows from the Carson River are augmented by the diversions from the Truckee River. The reservoir is maintained by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID).
The lake is named after ancient Lake Lahontan, which covered much of northwestern Nevada during the last ice age.

Lake Lahontan is long and has of shoreline. It consists of several lobes connected by narrow straits. When full, it has approximately of surface area, although it is usually less than half full by late summer. As no water rights have been allocated for recreation, the TCID could completely drain the lake to supply its irrigation customers. Submerged beneath the water were parts of stagecoach routes which existed during the 1800s including Williams Station, the scene of the Battle of Williams Station, a minor skirmish during the Paiute War.

A small settlement called &quot;Lahontan&quot; once stood near the reservoir, which in 1940 the Federal Writers&#x27; Project reported had a population of 25.

==Recreation==
The lake sits within the Lahontan State Recreation Area. Recreational uses include fishing, pleasure boating and camping. Much of the shoreline is sandy and makes for good camping. As it is contaminated with mercury from the Comstock and other mines, consumption of fish from the lake should be limited as per posted guidelines. Primary game fish include wipers (white bass x striper hybrid), white bass, walleye, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, spotted bass, and crappie. It is stocked with walleye fry and fingerling wipers nearly every year. The best fishing occurs from April through July and October.

==Variations==
The Carson River enters the lake at its southwestern end. The lake is very shallow there, and the shoreline can vary drastically as the lake empties and fills. The Derby Dam diverts part of the Truckee River into the Truckee Canal which enters the lake at the northeastern end, immediately adjacent to the Lahontan dam.

During the 2017 California floods, the highest inflow in history filled the lake, and a weir was made to handle outflow. Oversized culverts were quickly put under US95 and lined with ripraps to let the water cross the road and protect Fallon from flooding.

<text>The Anderson Valley Advertiser is a small weekly tabloid published in Anderson Valley, California. It was founded in 1955 as a local, community-based paper. The &quot;AVA&quot;&#x27;s masthead features mottoes borrowed from the French Revolution and the Industrial Workers of the World:

*&quot;Fanning the Flames of Discontent!&quot; (The IWW&#x27;s Little Red Songbook is sub-titled &quot;To Fan the Flames of Discontent&quot;)
*&quot;Peace to the Cottages! War on the Palaces!&quot; (The motto of Georg Büchner&#x27;s Hessian Courier)
*&quot;All Happy - None Rich - None Poor&quot;

Various quotations are distributed throughout every issue of the paper. Examples include:

*&quot;Be as radical as reality.&quot; - Lenin
*&quot;Newspapers should have no friends.&quot; - Joseph Pulitzer

Contributors include:

*Robert Mailer Anderson
*Alexander Cockburn
*Jeffrey St. Clair
*Flynn Washburne

Bruce Anderson has owned and edited the Anderson Valley Advertiser since January 1984. He left the AVA, as the paper is known, in 2004 for Oregon where he tried to start another weekly. It failed and Anderson bought the AVA back in July 2007. The paper enjoys a modest national circulation. Its masthead bills it as &quot;America&#x27;s last newspaper.&quot; The paper is unique in that it is based in the rural community of Boonville, Mendocino County, California, but features much leftwing opinion wrapped around local sports, school board reports, profiles of local characters, and impressively detailed stories on local controversies. Anderson describes himself as &quot;a socialist with strong, nay overwhelming, anarchist instincts.&quot;

<text>Josephine Vicari Massucci Franz (August 20, 1930 – May 28, 2004), known by the stage name Josie Carey, was a lyricist and a host of several children&#x27;s television shows.

==Biography==

Carey was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Butler, Pennsylvania as Josephine Vicari and would later change her name at the suggestion of her television station&#x27;s general manager. Carey was the host of Pittsburgh&#x27;s children show, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; on WQED from 1953 to 1961. Carey was one of the station&#x27;s original employees, beginning work there in October 1953 — six months before WQED actually started broadcasting. She went door-to-door, raising money for the station selling $2 educational program guides.

Carey was partnered with Fred Rogers who would act as puppeteer of various puppets who would dance along to 68 songs which he wrote and for which Carey wrote the lyrics. Carey joined ASCAP in 1955 and she and Rogers produced such songs as &quot;Goodnight God,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Morning,&quot; and &quot;Why Hi, Don&#x27;t I Know You?&quot; — the theme song for her program. Carey once remarked on their collaboration, &quot;He would make me very angry because I&#x27;d labor over my lyrics and he would sit at the piano and what took me four hours, he would do in four minutes.&quot; Carey wrote the lyrics to &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; which Rogers sang at the end of each &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; episode until 1972. The puppet characters included Daniel S. Tiger, Grandpère Tiger, King Friday XIII of Calendarland, his wife Queen Sara Saturday, X the owl, and Henrietta the cat.

&quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; was syndicated on NBC for 39 weeks and won a Sylvania Award in 1955 for the best locally produced children&#x27;s program in the country. &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; debuted puppet characters who would go on to future fame on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;; characters like King Friday XIII (who would dub four children &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Princess&quot; during the birthday greetings segment of the Children&#x27;s Corner) and Daniel Striped Tiger, who was named after WQED&#x27;s first general manager, Dorothy Daniel. The program also featured a wide range of human guests, including Johnny Carson, Shirley Jones, Van Cliburn, and Charles Schulz.

After her show was cancelled, Carey went on to host other children&#x27;s programming, including &quot;Josie&#x27;s Storyland&quot; and &quot;Funsville&quot;, which were aired on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh; &quot;Wheee!&quot; in South Carolina in the 1970s; and most recently, &quot;Josie&#x27;s Attic&quot; during the 1990s on WQEX in Pittsburgh.

On July 23, 1999, Carey was interviewed by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences for its archives in North Hollywood. She continued to perform, act, and direct in Pittsburgh community theater until her death, which resulted from complications from a fall, at the age of 73.

== Awards ==

*1965—Pittsburgh Post Gazette named Josie Carey &quot;Woman of the Year.&quot;
*1955—Sylvania Award - best locally produced children&#x27;s program in the country
*Both Duquesne University and the Pittsburgh Junior Chamber of Commerce would honor Carey with awards for her efforts in children&#x27;s programming.

<doc id="699156" wikidata="Q2345115" url="?curid=699156" title="None of the above">
<text>&quot;None of the above&quot; (NOTA), or none for short, also known as &quot;against all&quot; or a &quot;scratch&quot; vote, is a ballot option in some jurisdictions or organizations, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a voting system. It is based on the principle that consent requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as they can by voting &quot;No&quot; on ballot questions. It must be contrasted with &quot;abstention&quot;, in which a voter does not cast a ballot.

Entities that include &quot;None of the Above&quot; on ballots as standard procedure include Argentina, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria („Не подкрепям никого“, &quot;I don&#x27;t support anyone&quot;), Canada, Colombia (), France (&quot;vote blanc&quot;, &quot;blank vote&quot;), Greece (, blank), India (&quot;None of the above&quot;), Indonesia (, &quot;empty box&quot;), Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, North Korea, Norway, Peru, Spain (, &quot;blank vote&quot;), Uruguay, and the U.S. state of Nevada (None of These Candidates).

Russia had such an option on its ballots (, &quot;against all&quot;) until it was abolished in 2006. Bangladesh introduced this option (, &quot;no vote&quot;) in 2008. Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the 2013 Pakistan elections, but the Election Commission of Pakistan later rejected it. Beginning with the 2016 presidential election, and 2017 parliamentary one, Bulgaria introduced a &#x27;none of the above&#x27; option, which received in the presidential elections 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off. It was also used in the 2019 mayoral election of Sofia. Kazakhstan originally included the option (, &quot;against all&quot;) from 1995 to 2004, and from 2021 onwards after reintroducing the option, which notably received 5.8% of the vote in the 2022 presidential election.

When &quot;none of the above&quot; is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a majority or plurality of the vote, and so &quot;winning&quot; the election. This possibility is not purely theoretical, as NOTA has indeed won occasionally. In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the position remain vacant, having the position filled by appointment, re-opening nominations, or holding another election (in a body operating under parliamentary procedure), or it may have no effect, as in India and the US state of Nevada, where the next highest total wins regardless.

==Canada==
No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists &quot;none of the above&quot; as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections it is effectively possible to vote for &quot;none of the above&quot;, by attending the polling station and formally &quot;declining to vote&quot;. These declined votes are counted and become part of the electoral record.

A businessman in Prince George, British Columbia ran in the 1997 federal election in the district of Prince George—Bulkley Valley under the name Zznoneoff, Thea Bove (Thea Bove Zznoneoff); since ballots listed candidates alphabetically by surname, he appeared at the bottom. He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast.

A resident of Oshawa, Ontario, formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, had legally changed his name to &quot;Above Znoneofthe&quot;, and had registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal elections, most recently challenging the sitting prime minister&#x27;s riding of Papineau in the 2021 Canadian federal election as the Rhinoceros Party candidate. His name order was chosen so that his name would always appear at the bottom of the ballot as &quot;Znoneofthe, Above&quot;, although this only works federally as provincial election ballots do not list the candidates in surname order.

The 2020 Green Party leadership election featured a preferential ballot which allowed voters to select &quot;none of the options&quot; as a ranked selection.

In Ontario, the None of the Above Party of Ontario is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as independent representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a &quot;reject all of the candidates&quot; placeholder.

==Colombia==
In Colombia, a NOTA option in the ballots has been recognized by the Constitutional Court of Colombia by upholding a political reform law (Law 1475 of 2011), declaring that a None of the Above vote is &quot;a political expression of dissent, abstention or inconformity with political effects&quot; and also adding that &quot;a None of the Above vote constitutes a valuable expression of dissent through which the electorate&#x27;s will protection can be promoted. As such, the constitution grants it a decisive importance in the election of uni-personal offices and public corporations&quot;. The NOTA option has been present in ballots since at least 1991; in fact legislative act 01 of 2009 instructs what should happen if NOTA would &quot;win&quot; an election.
In accordance with the aforementioned Act, if an election for a public corporation (such as Congress, Assemblies or Councils), Governor, Mayor or the first round of the presidential elections would end with None of the Above as the absolute majority of valid ballots, the election must be repeated a single time with new candidates (for unipersonal offices, like president, governor or mayor) and for public corporations, the election must be repeated with only the lists which had achieved the threshold for seats. If the blank vote is again the majority in the new election, then the candidate with the most votes is declared elected.

In the regional elections of 2011 for the municipality of Bello, Antioquia, 56.7% of voters picked None of the Above, defeating the uncontested candidate and prompting the election for Mayor to be repeated.

==France==
In France, the NOTA vote has been recognised since the Revolution. According to the law currently (May 2023) applicable, &quot;Blank ballot papers are counted separately and annexed to the minutes. They are not taken into account for the determination of the votes cast, but they are specially mentioned in the results of the ballot. An envelope containing no ballot paper is considered to be a blank ballot paper.&quot;
The blank (i.e. &quot;white&quot;) vote is considered as an act of political participation (very different to abstention where the voter does not cast a ballot, as well as to casting an invalid ballot) sending the message that &quot;none of the options suits me&quot;, for instance in the case of a referendum.

==India==
The Election Commission of India told the Supreme Court in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a &quot;none of the above&quot; option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed. The People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties, a non-governmental organisation, filed a public-interest litigation statement in support of this.

On 27 September 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the right to register a &quot;none of the above&quot; vote in elections should apply and ordered the Election Commission to provide such a button in the electronic voting machines, noting that it would increase participation.

The Election Commission also clarified that even though votes cast as NOTA are counted, they are considered as invalid votes so they will not change the outcome of the election process. They are not taken into account for calculating the total valid votes and will not be considered for determining the forfeiture of deposit.

In the 2014 general election, NOTA polled 1.1% of the votes, counting to over 6,000,000.

The specific symbol for NOTA, a ballot paper with a black cross across it, was introduced on 18 September 2015. The symbol is designed by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad.

==Indonesia==

The Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections, and includes provisions for elections in which there is only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as &quot;kotak kosong&quot;/empty box), and is declared the winner if they manage to secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election will be postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again.

There were three uncontested runs in the 2015 local elections, nine in the 2017 local elections, at least 13 in the 2018 local elections (including the mayoral elections for Tangerang and Makassar), 25 in the 2020 local elections, and 37 in the 2024 local elections. 

As of 2024, three second-level local elections have resulted in NOTA &quot;victories&quot;. In the 2018 election for mayor of Makassar, the NOTA option received over 300,000 votes, 35,000 more than the sole candidate, forcing a repeat election in 2020. In 2024, the elections for mayor of Pangkalpinang and the regent of Bangka Regency also resulted in NOTA &quot;wins&quot;.

== Kazakhstan ==
In Kazakhstan, the &quot;none of the above&quot; (Бәріне қарсымын, &quot;against all&quot;) option is provided in voting ballots as per Article 37(1) of the Constitutional Law &quot;On Elections&quot;. Initially introduced in the 1991 presidential election, voters could cross out candidate names as means of choosing NOTA. The option was officially included in the election law in 1995 but removed in 2004. Despite its removal, activists protested by casting unofficial NOTA votes and engaging in spoiled voting. In 2016, Astana lawyer Anton Fabry unsuccessfully sought a complaint to the Supreme Court, alleging that the Central Election Commission had completely neglected the interests of NOTA voters by excluding the voting option from the ballots as an &quot;deliberate deception&quot; to manipulate voter turnout. 

During the 2021 legislative election, its absence was a significant issue, leading President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to propose reinstating it, resulting in its reinstatement in June 2021. The NOTA option for the first time was used again during the direct elections of rural äkims (local heads) in July 2021. In the 2022 presidential election, the NOTA option received 5.8% (460,484 votes), making it the second-largest picked option in the vote share. However, Minister of Justice Qanat Musin clarified that NOTA votes would only be considered as evidence of voter turnout, not as a determining factor due to a lack of legislation on the matter, emphasizing its role as an exercise of the right to participate in elections.

==Norway==
The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the parliamentary election of 2013, 12,874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank.

==Peru==
In Peru, the ballot is declared null and void if two-thirds of the voters vote blank.

==Soviet Union==
In the 1990 elections that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Soviet version of &quot;none of above&quot; (cross out voting) led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies. More than 100 incumbents representing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were defeated in the run-off, leading Boris Yeltsin to later say the &quot;none of the above&quot; option &quot;helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy.&quot;

==Spain==

===Blank ballot===
Owing to the Spanish voting regulations (), the blank ballot is recognized as &#x27;none of the above&#x27; () but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered as a statistical indicator of candidatures&#x27; disapproval. The blank ballots only increase the number of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% and 5% depending on the election) which every political party has to overcome to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the D&#x27;Hondt method.

===Blank seats ()===
Since 1999, several political parties have arisen in order to make visible the &#x27;none of the above&#x27; option in the parliaments and force empty seats. &quot;Blank Seats&quot; ran for the Congress and Senate elections of 20 November 2011. Its programme is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any money from the public funding scheme for politics.

By voting such option at the local elections in May 2011, the citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foixà (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively. Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes).

The (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved.

==United Kingdom==
UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including &#x27;rejected&#x27; votes. &#x27;Rejected votes&#x27; are classified into four categories, protest votes are recorded with others rejected as &#x27;voter&#x27;s intention uncertain&#x27;.

===NOTA UK===
NOTA UK is a voluntary organisation set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions to the parliamentary Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee (PCRC) making the case for NOTA &#x27;with teeth&#x27;, i.e. formalised consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA &#x27;win&#x27; (as opposed to &#x27;faux&#x27; NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on &#x27;voter engagement&#x27;, published in February 2015, that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK&#x27;s campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer Jamie Stanley (known as Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews. No public consultation materialised as the incoming Conservative majority government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.

Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK&#x27;s lobbying, it has been a policy of the Green Party of England and Wales to get a form of NOTA (RON – Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers. In the run-up to the 2017 UK general election, NOTA UK wrote to the Green party suggesting that they should reword the policy so that, instead of RON, it refers specifically to the more self-explanatory NOTA, and that they should also place the policy centre stage in their next manifesto.

===Above and Beyond Party===

The Above and Beyond Party was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the 2015 general election, none of whom were elected. Their sole stated policy was to introduce a &quot;none of the above&quot; option on all UK ballot papers. The party&#x27;s logo is based on the West African Adinkra symbol &quot;Aya&quot;, &quot;derived from a fern tree which famously grows in difficult-to-survive places&quot;, and a symbol of resilience. Critics pointed out that their website and Facebook page at the time indicated that they had policy ideas and a political agenda beyond the single issue of NOTA and appeared to be jumping on the bandwagon of other NOTA campaigns.

====Inception and officers====
The party registered with the Electoral Commission on 18 March 2015. The Electoral Commission listed the party leader, nominating officer and campaigns officer as Mark Flanagan and the treasurer was Karen Stanley. The party chairman was Michael Ross. The party was de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 3 November 2016.

====Electoral history====
Above and Beyond fielded four candidates in the 2015 general election. The candidates stood in Clwyd West, Cheadle, Sheffield Central and Leeds North West. In Sheffield Hallam the party endorsed Carlton Reeve, an independent candidate. No Above and Beyond candidate received 5% or more of the votes cast, therefore all lost their deposit.

====Finance====
The party raised funds partially through &quot;AboveBeyond&quot; music nights.

===No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party===
No Candidate Deserves My Vote! was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 23 November 2000. The No Candidate Deserves My Vote party&#x27;s single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a &quot;none of the above&quot; option added to every local and general election ballot paper of the future. They feel this will allow the UK electorate to exercise their democratic right to vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them, which will encourage their democratic responsibility to turn out to vote. If a candidate wins an election it is the intention to stay as a Member of Parliament until the change in the law is enacted. Only then will the candidate step down and the party be disbanded.

It is the intention of the party that, if a NOTA gains the majority vote, it should cause an automatic by-election, the idea being that the majority will have given a vote of no confidence in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for.

In 2010, Stephen Phillips of Stevenage stood in the UK general election on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote. Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates.

===NOTA party===
The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 2 March 2009. It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes; this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote. The party was registered as &#x27;NOTA&#x27; and not &#x27;None of the Above&#x27; as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name. A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission on the grounds that the acronym &#x27;NOTA&#x27; is as good as the phrase &#x27;None of the Above&#x27;, the logic being that it would confuse voters into thinking it is possible to cast a formal vote for &#x27;None of the Above&#x27; when they would in fact just be voting for another party, albeit one standing on a single issue NOTA platform.

===Zero, None Of the Above===
None Of The Above Zero was a candidate at the 2010 general election in Filton and Bradley Stoke. Previously known as Eric Mutch, he changed his name by deed poll to stand under that name. As candidates are listed by surname first he appeared on the ballot paper as &quot;Zero, None Of The Above&quot;, in effect giving voters a &quot;none of the above&quot; option since had he been elected he would have resigned immediately. He came last with 172 votes.

===Others===
In the British parliamentary elections of 2010, a former boxer changed his name by deed poll from Terry Marsh to &quot;None Of The Above X&quot;, in order to run as a parliamentary candidate under that name in the constituency of South Basildon and East Thurrock. Claiming that he will not take the seat if he wins, he told BBC Essex: &quot;I don&#x27;t take it for one moment that it would be a vote for me. ... I&#x27;m doing what I think the Electoral Commission should be doing and what should be on every ballot paper in any electoral process.&quot; BBC News reported that, while the Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 stipulates that no political party can be registered in the UK under the name &quot;None of the Above&quot;, there is no legislation against a person changing their name by deed poll and appearing on the ballot paper as &quot;None Of the Above&quot;. In the event he polled 0.3% of the vote, the lowest of any candidate standing.
* Another individual changed his name by deed poll to &quot;None Of The Above&quot; in order to stand as a candidate in Chingford and Woodford Green in 2010. With the surname &quot;Above&quot;, he was listed first on the ballot paper in alphabetical order, with all the other candidates listed below.
* The South Wales Anarchists group has run a campaign urging people to &quot;Vote Nobody&quot; since 2008 and many other anarchist groups worldwide have promoted similar slogans.
* The Landless Peasant Party, which advocates the ownership of land by those who live on it and the replacement of income tax by a flat land tax, and whose leader Derek Jackson gained publicity for standing against then- Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his home constituency in the 2010 elections, include a pledge to add a &quot;None of the above&quot; option to the ballot in all UK elections.

==United States==

The origins of the ballot option &quot;None of the Above&quot; in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted &quot;None of These Candidates&quot; as a ballot option in 1976. In some United States presidential primaries, individuals can vote for unpledged delegates by voting Uncommitted. &quot;None of the above&quot; is also permitted in the bylaws of the Libertarian Party, with NOTA winning the 2024 presidential primaries in North Carolina and Massachusetts.

In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the &quot;None of the Above Act&quot;, qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State, but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%. Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the &quot;none of the above&quot; voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes.

No similar options were known to have been permitted in any other states as of 2022.

==Other countries (None of the Above candidates and parties)==
* In Serbia, None of the above (Ниједан од понуђених одговора, НОПО) was a parliamentary political party, founded in 2010 by Budimir Grom, which was mostly popularized on Facebook and less so on other social networking websites. In 2012 Serbian parliamentary election they received 22,905 votes, and thus won one seat in the National Assembly of Serbia.
* Geoff Richardson changed his full name to &quot;Of The Above None&quot; and stood as an independent for the seat of Gilmore at the 2007 Australian federal election. His name appeared as NONE, Of the Above on the ballot.
* In 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to Vasily Protyvsih (Vasily Against-all). &quot;Against all candidates&quot; is the name of the &quot;none of the above&quot; vote used in Russia and Ukraine.
* In 2000, Michael Moore advocated a write-in candidate &quot;Ficus (the plant) for Congress&quot; as a unified vote for &quot;none of the above&quot; in congressional seats where the incumbent was running unopposed.
* David Gatchell of Tennessee ran for governor in 2002 and for Senate in 2006 as a protest, officially changing his middle name from Leroy to None of the Above. In 2006, he got 3,738 votes (0.2 percent).
* For the 2013 Pakistani general election, the Election Commission of Pakistan unilaterally decided that a &#x27;none of the above&#x27; box would be available as a voting option on ballot papers. However, the commission subsequently decided against it owing to the short amount of time remaining until the elections. The concept was suggested to the Election Commission by Abid Hassan Manto, a constitutional expert and a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
* Elections in South Ossetia have an &quot;against all&quot; option.
* Elections in Abkhazia have a &quot;None of the above&quot; option.
* In 2021, the States Assembly of the Bailiwick of Jersey voted to introduce a &#x27;None of the Above&#x27; ballot option for uncontested elections, which is set to debut at the 2022 Jersey general election. This has been designed as a means to eliminate uncontested elections to the Island&#x27;s parliament. If the number of candidates standing for election is equal to or fewer than the available vacancies, voters will have the option to vote for &#x27;None of the Above&#x27; to reject the candidate and hold a new election, effectively functioning as a confirmatory ballot.

==Procedures that function like &quot;none of the above&quot;==
Most ballots do not have a formal &quot;none of the above&quot; option, but some have procedures that work in a similar way.

=== Argentina ===

In Argentina casting an envelope without a ballot in a ballot box counts as a blank vote.

===Poland===
In 1989 legislative election in Poland voters were able to vote against the only candidate running, often from the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party by crossing out the candidate&#x27;s name on the ballot. As a result, voters defeated the sitting prime minister and dozens of leading Communists because they failed to get the required majority.

===Re-open Nominations (RON)===
Many students&#x27; unions in Britain, Ireland, and others use a similar ballot option called &#x27;re-open nominations&#x27; (RON) in IRV and single transferable vote (STV) elections. These include the National Union of Students in the UK and UCD Student&#x27;s Union in Ireland. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP (first-past-the-post) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election.

RON is not strictly a none of the above candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist.

===Illegal ballots in &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;===
The American &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order, Newly Revised (RONR)&quot; describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots which do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as &quot;scrap paper&quot;, and are of no effect, but &quot;unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters… are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority.&quot; RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. &quot;The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion.&quot;

=== No award ===

Voting for the Hugo Awards is by instant runoff voting, in which nominees for a category are ranked. There are normally seven options: six nominees, plus &quot;No Award&quot;. A first preference vote for no award implies that the voter believes that either the category should be abolished, or that none of the nominees are worthy of an award. A second or subsequent preference implies that any higher-ranked nominees are worthy of an award, while those ranked lower are not.

==Cultural references==
* In the film &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions,&quot; the protagonist Brewster (played by Richard Pryor) is required, under certain conditions, to spend $30,000,000 in thirty days in order to inherit $300,000,000. After failing to lose money through gambling and inadvisable investments, he joins the race for Mayor of New York City and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging voters to support None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor&#x27;s goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his &quot;None of the Above&quot; campaign became so popular. (Under the conditions of the inheritance deal, Brewster was not permitted to permanently acquire any assets using the $30,000,000, with the Mayor of New York&#x27;s $60,000 per annum salary being considered an asset.) Neither candidate wins the election, and a new election with different candidates must be held.
* In the sixth-season episode of &quot;Captain Planet&quot; called &quot;Dirty Politics&quot; three of the Eco-Villains are running for president and kidnap the fourth candidate, who is the most popular. Despite this over seventy percent vote None of the Above resulting in the need for a new election.
* L. Neil Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Probability Broach&quot; has an alternate history in which the United States becomes a libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, where None of the Above (which is always an option on the ballot) has received the most votes for President of the North American Confederacy on two occasions. The first time was in 1968, defeating Lucy Kropotkin by only one vote and would serve until 1972 as the NAC&#x27;s 24th President. The second time was in 2000 and again in 2004, being elected &quot;President for Life&quot; in 2008, serving as the 28th President and essentially abolishing the presidency.
* Wavy Gravy has run a &quot;Nobody for President&quot; campaign during several different election years in the United States.

<doc id="699157" wikidata="Q5043107" url="?curid=699157" title="Carly Janiga">
<text>&quot;Carly Janiga, nowCarly Reardon&quot;&#x27;, (born October 19, 1988) is an American former gymnast. She attended and competed for Stanford University. She has won gold medals in FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup competition and was NCAA champion in the uneven bars in 2010. She was named the Pacific-10 Conference Scholar Athlete of the Year in 2010.

==USA Gymnastics==
Janiga trained at the &quot;Desert Devils Gymnastics&quot; club in Mesa, Arizona under coach Geoff Eaton. She qualified for the Olympic trials in Anaheim, California in June 2004 at age 15. She finished ninth, qualifying for the final selection camp, but was not selected for the six-member team for the Athens Games. Her best event was floor exercise, featuring four &#x27;E&#x27; element tumbling passes: a double layout, double Arabian tucked, piked full-in, and whip through to triple full.

NBC commentator Tim Daggett said of Janiga, &quot;I don&#x27;t pick the team, (national team coordinator) Marta Karolyi does, and Marta Karolyi likes her a lot&quot;.

In late 2004, Janiga represented the United States in FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup competition. In September, Janiga competed at the Copa La Serena, held in La Serena, Chile, earning gold medals on vault and floor exercise and a silver medal on beam.

==NCAA Gymnastics==
Janiga entered Stanford University in fall 2006 and competed in NCAA Women&#x27;s Gymnastics championship each year until her graduation in 2010.

In 2007, Janiga was named first team All-American in the all-around, vault and floor exercise. She placed fourth in the all-around competition at the 2007 NCAA Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Championships. She was also named Pacific-10 Conference 2007 Freshman of the Year.

Janiga also won five individual conference titles at Stanford: balance beam in 2008 and 2009, all-around and uneven bars in 2009 and floor exercise in 2010.

Janiga was the all-around champion at the South Central Regional Championships in 2009. She ended her Stanford career with a 2010 NCAA title on the uneven bars with a score of 9.9375, only the second NCAA individual title in Stanford&#x27;s history. Stanford coach Kristen Smyth said, &quot;Tonight, Carly was what she&#x27;s been for Stanford for four years -- amazing and an absolute rock for our team and our program. She is going to be impossible to replace. I can&#x27;t think of a better way for her to cap off her career than she did tonight.&quot;

==Personal life==
Janiga graduated with a BA in Psychology from Stanford University in 2010, and an MA in Education in 2011 through the Stanford Teacher Education Program.

<doc id="699158" wikidata="Q2399424" url="?curid=699158" title="Technical director">
<text>A technical director (TD) is usually a senior technical person within e.g. a software company, engineering firm, film studio, theatre company or television studio. This person usually has the highest level of skill within a specific technical field.

It is also a common alternative title in association football for the position of Sporting director.

== Software ==
In software development, a technical director is typically responsible for the successful creation and delivery of the company&#x27;s product to the marketplace by managing technical risks and opportunities; making key software design and implementation decisions with the development teams, scheduling of tasks including tracking dependencies, managing change requests, and guaranteeing quality of deliveries and educating the team on technical best practices.

Typical responsibilities:
* Defines the technological strategy in conjunction with the development team of each project: pipeline, tools, and key development procedures
* Assesses technical risk and mitigation plan
* Establishes standards and procedures to track and measure project&#x27;s progression
* Evaluates development teams, identifying strengths, problem areas, and developing plans for improving performance
* Evaluates interview candidates for technical positions
* Scouts for and evaluates new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence
* Oversees technical design documentation process for correctness and timeliness
* Provides input to the other disciplines on the practicality of initial design goals and impact to the overall project timeline
* Evaluates software implementation on design and task thoroughness
* Helps to identify high risk areas for the project director
* Identifies weak software systems that need code improvement and schedules corrective action, when possible
* Creates automated test process for system features, where possible, and contributes to the build system
* Aids in all stages of post-production including during finalizing

== Engineering ==
Within engineering, the role of the technical director is often known as a technical authority, or technical manager. The description of technical manager is particularly widespread in the United Kingdom.

== Film ==
In visual effects (VFX) (Industrial Light and Magic, Sony Pictures Imageworks), feature animation (Pixar, Dreamworks Animation) and game development (Naughty Dog), a technical director&#x27;s responsibilities vary from studio to studio and as such, the term is not very well defined.

Typically, a TD is a combination of an artist and a programmer, responsible for the more technical aspects of film production, such as programming shaders, developing character rigs and animation setups, performing complex simulation tasks and setting up the pipeline (how the data is passed from one stage in the film production to the next). In contrast to a programmer, a TD would normally not work on large programming projects, but rather make heavy use of scripting languages such as Python, MEL, MAXScript, or shell scripting. Another responsibility of a TD is to look after any technical problems the regular artists encounter and to develop custom tools to improve the artists&#x27; workflow.

In these industries, &quot;technical artist&quot;, &quot;technical animator&quot; and &quot;generalist TD&quot; are sometimes used as synonyms.

===Categorization of technical directors in film ===
Frequently, the role of a TD is more precisely defined. Various areas of computer graphics require a high degree of specialized technical/scientific knowledge and therefore merit more precise categorization. As an example, a skilled Character TD has a strong understanding of human/animal anatomy, movement, and mechanics, whereas a skilled Lighting TD might have a detailed understanding of the physical properties of light and surfaces.

Those categories include (but are not limited to) the following.
* Effects TD
* Lighting TD
* Modeling TD 
* Pipeline TD
* Layout TD
* Creature TD or Character TD
* Hair TD 
* Cloth TD 
* Matchmove TD

== Theatre ==
It is a technical director&#x27;s job to make sure the technical equipment in the theater is functional, maintained and safe. The technical director, along with the production manager, is responsible for the overall organization of the technical production process. Duties included are generating necessary working drawings for construction (in conjunction with a draftsperson, if there is one); budget estimations and maintaining of accounts; materials research and purchasing; scheduling and supervising build crews; coordinating load-ins; handling conflicts that arise between different departments; and organizing the strike and clean-up for the production. Often, the Technical Director can serve as the head of the scenic department, supervising the master carpenter, carpenters, charge artists and leading them in the realization of the scenic designer&#x27;s vision.

In venues that host touring productions, the TD may also be responsible for advancing the technical rider, hiring local crew, renting equipment and liaising between the tour manager and the local crew.

== Television ==
In the USA the technical director works in a production control room of a television studio and operates the video switcher and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the television crew. For a remote broadcast outside the studio, the TD will perform the same duties in a mobile production truck. It is the TD&#x27;s job to ensure all positions are staffed and all equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the Television director. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the production equipment, allowing them to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into the creative side of the production, depending on the situation. They may provide the director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays to ensure quality control.

Technical directors commonly work on productions that are either broadcast live or recorded on video tape or video servers. Television productions shot on film generally do not use TDs, as the camera cuts and effects are realized in post production after the shooting is completed.

The terminology in most areas outside of the USA differs in some respects from the above description: The production control room is called a &quot;gallery&quot;, a mobile production truck is called an &quot;OB van&quot; or a &quot;scanner&quot; (a BBC term). In UK television practice, the technical director is the senior technical person in the gallery and supervises the technical team, but does not operate the &quot;vision mixer&quot;. The TD is responsible for ensuring that the gallery is technically fit for purpose, the routing of internal and external sources, as well as liaison with other technical areas such as master control rooms and transmission suites. They may additionally perform vision control duties, matching the exposure and colour balance of the cameras (&quot;racking&quot;).

<doc id="699163" wikidata="Q5251561" url="?curid=699163" title="Deficit round robin">
<text>Deficit Round Robin (DRR), also Deficit Weighted Round Robin (DWRR), is a scheduling algorithm for the network scheduler. DRR is, like weighted fair queuing (WFQ), a packet-based implementation of the ideal Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. It was proposed by M. Shreedhar and G. Varghese in 1995 as an efficient (with &quot;O(1)&quot; complexity) and fair algorithm.

== Details ==
In DRR, a scheduler handling N flows is configured with one quantum formula_1 for each flow. This global idea is that, at each round, the flow formula_2 can send at most formula_1 bytes, and the remaining, if any, is reported to the next round. In this way, the minimum rate that flow formula_2 will achieve over a long term is formula_5; where formula_6 is the link rate.

==Algorithm==
The DRR scans all non-empty queues in sequence. When a non-empty queue formula_2 is selected, its deficit counter is incremented by its quantum value. Then, the value of the deficit counter is a maximal number of bytes that can be sent at this turn: if the deficit counter is greater than the packet&#x27;s size at the head of the queue (HoQ), this packet can be sent, and the value of the counter is decremented by the packet size. Then, the size of the next packet is compared to the counter value, etc. Once the queue is empty or the value of the counter is insufficient, the scheduler will skip to the next queue. If the queue is empty, the value of the deficit counter is reset to 0.

 &quot;Variables and Constants&quot;
 const integer N // Nb of queues
 const integer Q[1..N] // Per queue quantum 
 integer DC[1..N] // Per queue deficit counter
 queue queue[1..N] // The queues

 &quot;Scheduling Loop&quot;
 while true do
 for i in 1..N do
 if not queue[i].empty() then
 DC[i]:= DC[i] + Q[i]
 while( not queue[i].empty() and
 DC[i] ≥ queue[i].head().size() ) do
 DC[i] := DC[i] − queue[i].head().size()
 send( queue[i].head() )
 queue[i].dequeue()
 end while 
 if queue[i].empty() then
 DC[i] := 0
 end if
 end if
 end for
 end while

== Performances: fairness, complexity, and latency==

Like other GPS-like scheduling algorithm, the choice of the weights is left to the network administrator.

Like WFQ, DRR offers a minimal rate to each flow whatever the size of the packets is. In weighted round robin scheduling, the fraction of bandwidth used depend on the packet&#x27;s sizes.

Compared with WFQ scheduler that has complexity of &quot;O(log(n))&quot; (&quot;n&quot; is the number of active flows/queues), the complexity of DRR is &quot;O(1)&quot;, if the quantum formula_1 is larger than the maximum packet size of this flow. Nevertheless, this efficiency has a cost: the latency, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the distance to the ideal GPS, is larger in DRR than in WFQ. More on the worst-case latencies can be found here.

== Implementations ==

An implementation of the deficit round robin algorithm was written by Patrick McHardy for the Linux kernel and published under the GNU General Public License.

In Cisco and Juniper routers, modified versions of DRR are implemented: since the latency of DRR can be larger for some class of traffic, these modified versions give higher priority to some queues, whereas the others are served with the standard DRR algorithm.

<text>Scolymus hispanicus, the common golden thistle or Spanish oyster thistle, is a flowering plant in the genus &quot;Scolymus&quot; in the family Asteraceae, native to southern and western Europe, north to northwestern France.

It is a herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant growing to 80 cm tall, with spiny stems and leaves. The flowerheads are bright yellow to orange-yellow, 2–3 cm diameter

==Uses==
Since at least the time of Theophrastus in ancient Greece, this plant has been known for medicinal and culinary uses. Although it has been cultivated at times, currently most of the plant which is consumed comes from harvesting wild plants. In parts of Spain, it is eaten in stews during spring. It is also used in salads and soups, and it is served with scrambled eggs in Extremadura and Andalusia, Spain, where it is called . In the sixteenth century in Salamanca, the washed young plants used to be eaten with their root, either raw or in stews with meat.

In parts of southern Italy, the leaves are only gathered during Holy Week, after which they are used to bake a meat pie to be eaten on Easter.

<doc id="699170" wikidata="Q3502806" url="?curid=699170" title="Suck.com">
<text>Suck.com was an online magazine, one of the earliest ad-supported content sites on the Internet. It featured daily editorial content on a great variety of topics, including politics and pop-culture. Launched in 1995 and geared towards a Generation X audience, the website&#x27;s motto was &quot;A fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun&quot;. Despite not publishing new content since 2001, the site remained online until December 2018.

==History ==
&quot;Suck&quot; was initiated in 1995 by writer Joey Anuff and editor Carl Steadman, two former employees of &quot;HotWired&quot;, the first commercial online magazine. The name of the website, Suck.com, was chosen as a domain name with possibly offensive connotations — though apparently not enough to be disallowed by Network Solutions, which controlled the InterNIC system for the distribution of domain names before ICANN acquired that authority. The name also described the nature of &quot;news aggregator&quot; sites that &quot;sucked&quot; stories from the internet and published them in magazine-like formats.

During 1996, &quot;Suck&quot; integrated the writing talent of Heather Havrilesky, who provided the sarcastic comments of her supposed alter ego &quot;Polly Esther&quot; in her column, &quot;Filler&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;Suck&quot; published a compilation of the site&#x27;s most popular essays in &quot;Suck: Worst-Case Scenarios in Media, Culture, Advertising and the Internet&quot; ().

In the years 2000 to 2001, cartoonist Peter Bagge did a number of comics journalism stories for &quot;Suck&quot; on such topics as politics, the Miss America Pageant, bar culture, and the Oscars.

===Closure===

In July 2000, after a decrease in Internet investment, Suck.com merged with &quot;Feed Magazine&quot; to create Automatic Media. The concept was to streamline operations and collaborate on boutique operations with low staffing costs. The joint project, Plastic.com, was founded with only four staffed employees.

Despite the site&#x27;s faithful following and a combined reader base of more than one million, however, Automatic Media ended in June 2001. On June 8, 2001, Suck.com declared that they were &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot; indefinitely, and the site ceased to publish new content. Regarding the indefinite hiatus, co-founder Joey Anuff said, &quot;It was a shame. On the other hand... it’s shocking how long &quot;Suck&quot; lasted.&quot;

=== Archive email newsletter ===
During the autumn of 2015, software developer Mark MacDonald began serializing the website&#x27;s archive in an email newsletter, which is sent on a daily basis 20 years-to-the-day after its original publication on Suck.com.

== Style ==
From the beginning, site founders Anuff and Steadman created daily comically cynical commentary with a self-obsessed and satiric theme. The writing was accentuated by the art of cartoonist Terry Colon. In addition to Colon&#x27;s distinctive artwork, the website also had many features common to its articles. The main text of each article was restricted to a table only 200 pixels wide. Most articles featured links within the flow of the content rather than as in labeled footnotes or references, which was less common then than it would become a few years later.

== Recognition ==
Suck.com was nominated for Webby Awards in both 1997 (Books and Magazines category) and 1999 (Humor category).

==Regular columns==
*&quot;Hit &amp; Run&quot; — a link-driven summary of recent events.
*&quot;Filler&quot; — a weekly self-deprecating satire of cultural pretension and dating in postmodern times.

<doc id="699172" wikidata="Q374960" url="?curid=699172" title="John J. Gilligan">
<text>John Joyce “Jack” Gilligan (March 22, 1921 – August 26, 2013) was an American World War II veteran, educator and Democratic politician from the state of Ohio who served as a U.S. Representative and as the 62nd governor of Ohio from 1971 to 1975. He was the father of Kathleen Sebelius, who later served as governor of Kansas and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.

==Early life==
Gilligan was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Harry Gilligan, a funeral home operator, and his wife, Blanche. His twin sister was Jeanne Joyce Gilligan. His family was Irish Catholic. He graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1939, the University of Notre Dame in 1943 and the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1947, serving in between in the United States Navy during World War II in the Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean as a destroyer gunnery officer.

==Career==

After the war, Gilligan returned to Cincinnati to teach literature at Xavier University from 1948 to 1953. 

He also served as member of the Cincinnati city council from 1953 to 1963, and was a candidate for Ohio Congressman-at-Large in 1962. 

=== U. S. Representative and Senate campaign ===
In 1964, he was elected to the Eighty-ninth Congress as a representative for Ohio&#x27;s 1st district, serving from January 3, 1965 – January 3, 1967. Gilligan narrowly lost his re-election bid to the Ninetieth Congress in 1966 to Republican Robert Taft Jr. after the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly redrew his district to favor the Republican Party. In 1968, Gilligan defeated sitting U.S. Senator Frank J. Lausche in the Democratic primary; however, he narrowly lost in the general election to Republican William B. Saxbe after Lausche declined to support him in the general election.

=== Governor ===
Gilligan won election for governor of Ohio in 1970, defeating Republican state Auditor Roger Cloud, and serving from 1971 to 1975. His signature achievement in office was the creation of Ohio&#x27;s state income tax. Gilligan was seen as a favorite to win a second term but lost re-election in an upset in the strongly Democratic Watergate year of 1974 to former Republican governor James A. Rhodes (who had been barred from running in 1970 due to term limits) by only 11,488 votes. The backlash of big business against Gilligan and in favor of Rhodes was seen by many as the reason for his defeat.

=== Later career ===
Gilligan subsequently served as the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1977 to 1979. In 1980, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. He served as director of the Institute for Public Policy from 1979 to 1986, and taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1986 to 1992. He also served as director of the civic issues forum at the University of Cincinnati School of Law. In 1999, Gilligan was elected to the Board of Education of the Cincinnati Public Schools. He chose not to stand for re-election when his term expired in 2007.

==UFO sighting==
On October 17, 1973, Gilligan, while governor, claimed to have seen a UFO while driving near Ann Arbor, Michigan. During a press conference he stated: &quot;I saw one (UFO) the other night, so help me. I&#x27;m absolutely serious. I saw this.&quot;

==Family==
Gilligan is the father of four children, including Kathleen Sebelius, who served as Governor of Kansas and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. They became the first father/daughter governor duo in the United States after her election.

==Death==
Gilligan died at home in Cincinnati on August 26, 2013, at the age of 92. His son said he died of congestive heart failure.

<text>Michael Vincent DiSalle (January 6, 1908September 16, 1981) was the 60th governor of Ohio, serving from 1959 to 1963. A Democrat, he was a member of the Toledo City Council and served as the 46th mayor of Toledo from 1948 to 1950.

== Early life ==

DiSalle was born on January 6, 1908, in New York City, to Italian-American immigrant parents, Anthony and Assunta DiSalle. His family moved to Toledo, Ohio, when he was three years old. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Georgetown University in 1931. He married Myrtle E. England; the couple had four daughters and one son.

DiSalle was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1932. In 1949, the University of Notre Dame conferred him an honorary doctorate of law.

== Political career ==

In 1936, DiSalle was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives; he served one term and lost an election for the Ohio Senate in 1938.

Following the loss, DiSalle held a series of offices in the city government of Toledo, Ohio. He was assistant law director from 1939 to 1941. In 1941, he was elected to the Toledo City Council; the council selected him as vice-mayor in 1943 and 1945.

In 1946, DiSalle ran in the U.S. House election in the Toledo-based 9th district, but he lost narrowly to the Republican incumbent, Homer A. Ramey.

DiSalle was elected as mayor of Toledo in 1947 and re-elected in 1949, and served from 1948 until his resignation on November 30, 1950, to accept a federal appointment. During his mayoralty, Toledo fully re-paid its debts.
In 1950, he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. He lost to then-state auditor Joseph T. Ferguson, who in turn lost the general election to the Republican incumbent, Robert A. Taft. In December 1950, President Harry S. Truman appointed DiSalle as director of the Office of Price Stabilization, a sub-agency of the Korean War-era Economic Stabilization Agency which established and enforced war-time price controls. DiSalle resigned as director on January 23, 1952, in order to run again for U.S. Senate. He won the Democratic nomination but lost the general election to the Republican incumbent, John W. Bricker.

In December 1952, President Truman (now a lame duck) appointed DiSalle as director of the Economic Stabilization Agency, replacing Roger Putnam. The appointment lasted less than one month, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower abolished the agency on April 30, 1953.

In 1956, DiSalle was the Democratic nominee for governor of Ohio, losing to then-state attorney general C. William O&#x27;Neill. In their 1958 re-match, DiSalle defeated O&#x27;Neill. The gubernatorial term had in 1954 been lengthened from two years to four years, starting with the 1958 election; so DiSalle served as governor from 1959 to 1963.

In July 1959, DiSalle signed a bill designating &quot;with God, all things are possible&quot; as the official motto of the State of Ohio. The motto is derived from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 19, verse 26.

DiSalle was a favorite son candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1960. He ran only in the Ohio primary, which he won with 60.25% of the vote against Albert S. Porter, who had run against him in the gubernatorial primary in 1958. Of the total popular vote in the primaries, DiSalle placed sixth behind eventual nominee Sen. John F. Kennedy, as well as Gov. Pat Brown, perennial candidate George H. McLain, Sen. Hubert Humphrey, and Sen. George Smathers.

In 1962, DiSalle lost re-election as governor to then-state auditor Jim Rhodes, after voters disapproved of several aspects of his administration, including his opposition to capital punishment, a tax increase, and a policy which billed wards of state for living necessities.

=== Opposition to capital punishment ===

DiSalle was an opponent of death penalty and commuted a number of sentences as governor. He allowed six of the 12 death sentences he reviewed as governor to proceed. DiSalle stated that despite being &quot;totally opposed to the death penalty&quot;, he could not use his power of executive clemency without mitigating circumstances or evidence of miscarriage of justice. To do so would be to personally repeal the law providing for capital punishment in Ohio, and he might have been impeached for violating his oath of office, DiSalle wrote.

DiSalle personally investigated all cases of people scheduled to be executed by electric chair and even personally met with some of them. He agreed with Clinton Duffy, who said that murderers are more likely to be rehabilitated than other criminals. &quot;To demonstrate his faith in rehabilitation, [DiSalle] made it a point to hire convicted murderers to serve on his household staff&quot; at the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

One of DiSalle&#x27;s primary concerns regarding the death penalty was that poorer defendants did not have the same access to counsel as rich defendants, and therefore would suffer the death penalty disproportionately. He recalled: &quot;I found that the men in death row had one thing in common: they were penniless&quot;. They were defended in court by court-appointed attorneys, some without criminal legal experience. Professional criminals &quot;did not have to depend on volunteers&quot;, DiSalle wrote. &quot;Nor were they ever, in my experience, executed&quot;.

DiSalle believed that penology should be improved. Ronald Fenton, among the 12 cases he reviewed, had raped and murdered a baby. The governor believed that such acts had proved his insanity, but psychiatrists had found him sane. Although he believed that the M&#x27;Naghten Rule was flawed, because of the finding—and expecting that had he been commuted to life imprisonment &quot;his prisonmates would have made his life unbearable&quot;—DiSalle allowed the execution. He cited the case as an example of how the justice system had failed to study the behavior of a minor criminal to prevent him from committing murder.

After leaving the governorship, DiSalle co-founded and served as a chairman of the National Committee to Abolish Federal Death Penalty. His 1965 book, &quot;The Power of Life or Death,&quot; discusses this issue and chronicles his difficult experiences as the man charged with making the final decision regarding a sentence commutation. He is quoted in the book &quot;Mercy on Trial: What It Means to Stop an Execution&quot; as saying, &quot;No one who has never watched the hands of a clock marking the last minutes of a condemned man&#x27;s existence, knowing that he alone has the temporary Godlike power to stop the clock, can realize the agony of deciding an appeal for executive clemency&quot;.

=== Electoral history ===









== Later life ==
In 1966, he joined the Washington, D.C., law firm of Chapman, Duff, and Paul. In 1979, he co-founded the Washington, D.C., law firm of DiSalle &amp; Staudinger.

The same year, DiSalle also authored the book &quot;Second Choice&quot;, a history of the U.S. vice presidency.

DiSalle led a draft movement for a potential 1968 presidential campaign by Sen. Ted Kennedy. He served as the honorary chairman of Kennedy&#x27;s 1980 presidential campaign.

DiSalle died on September 16, 1981, of a heart attack while vacationing in Pescara, Italy.

== Legacy ==

DiSalle has two current structures in Ohio named for him:

*Toledo – Michael DiSalle Government Center housing federal, state, county, and city governmental offices.
*Toledo – Michael V. DiSalle Bridge carrying I-75 across the Maumee River.

Also, the DiSalle Center (no longer standing) at the Ohio Expo Center and the Ohio State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, was named in honor of DiSalle.

<text>The Lyman House Memorial Museum, also known as the Lyman Museum and Lyman House, is a Hilo, Hawaii-based natural history museum founded in 1931 in the Lyman family mission house, originally built in 1838. The main collections were moved to an adjacent modern building in the 1960s, while the house is open for tours as the island&#x27;s oldest surviving wood-framed building.

==The mission==
Reverend David Belden Lyman and his wife, Sarah Joiner Lyman, arrived in 1832, missionaries from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. It was one of the first houses on the island to be built in the style of their native New England, using native koa and ohia woods. Guests included Mark Twain and Isabella Bird. In 1854 - 1859 the new Haili Church was built across the street, replacing the thatched structures that served previously for the congregation.

The mission house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 1978, as site 78001012. It is located at 276 Haili Street in Hilo, coordinates .

==The museum==
Almost a century after the missionaries&#x27; arrival, a museum was founded in 1931 by their descendants.

In the late 1960s, architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed and built a Museum building adjacent to the mission house. Upon its completion, the Museum moved there and expanded its exhibits. It has extensive displays on Hawaiian culture and is renowned for its collection of shells and minerals, including a specimen of orlymanite, named for Orlando Hammond Lyman (1903–1986), the museum&#x27;s founder and great grandson of David and Sarah Lyman. The Museum has been an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution since 2002.

<doc id="699197" wikidata="Q746112" url="?curid=699197" title="L'Osservatore Romano">
<text>L&#x27;Osservatore Romano (; English: &quot;The Roman Observer&quot;) is the daily newspaper of Vatican City State which reports on the activities of the Holy See and events taking place in the Catholic Church and the world. It is owned by the Holy See but is not an official publication, a role reserved for the &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, which acts as a government gazette. The views expressed in the &quot;Osservatore&quot; are those of individual authors unless they appear under the specific titles &quot;Nostre Informazioni&quot; or &quot;Santa Sede&quot;.

Available in nine languages, the paper prints two Latin mottos under the masthead of each edition: &quot;Unicuique suum&quot; (&#x27;To each his own&#x27;) and &quot;Non praevalebunt&quot; (&#x27;[The gates of Hell] shall not prevail&#x27;). The current editor-in-chief is Andrea Monda.

==Editions==
&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; is published in eight different languages (listed by date of first publication):
* Daily and weekly in Italian (1861/1950)
* Weekly in French (1949)
* Weekly in English (1968)
* Weekly in Spanish (1969)
* Weekly in Portuguese (1970)
* Weekly in German (1971)
* Monthly in Polish (1980)
* Weekly in Malayalam (2007)

The daily Italian edition of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; is published in the afternoon, but with a cover date of the following day, a convention that sometimes results in confusion. The weekly English edition is distributed in more than 129 countries, including both English-speaking countries and locales where English is used as the general means of communication.

===&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore della Domenica&quot;===
&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore della Domenica&quot; is a weekly publication in Vatican City. It is the Sunday supplement to the &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;. Founded in 1934, an illustrated weekly was published with the title &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore romano della Domenica&quot; (since 1951 &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore della Domenica&quot;). In 1979 it was reduced to a Sunday supplement.

===&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore di Strada&quot;===
Since 29 June 2022, another edition of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; is published: &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore di Strada&quot;. It is published the first Sunday of every month. On 29 June 2022, its first print publication was distributed to those present at Saint Peter&#x27;s Square. On the same day, at the end of the Pope&#x27;s service, the Pope made a remark at the end of his marian prayer praising the newspaper.

==History==
===19th century===
The first issue of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; was published in Rome on 1 July 1861, a few months after the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed on 17 March 1861. The original intent of the newspaper was unabashedly polemical and propagandistic in defence of the Papal States, adopting the name of a private pamphlet financed by a French Catholic legitimist group. The 18 September 1860 defeat of papal troops at Castelfidardo substantially reduced the temporal power of the Pope, prompting Catholic intellectuals to present themselves in Rome for the service of Pope Pius IX. This agenda supported the notion of a daily publication to champion the opinions of the Holy See.

By July 1860, the deputy Minister of the Interior, Marcantonio Pacelli (grandfather of the future Pope Pius XII), had plans to supplement the official bulletin of the Catholic Church &quot;Giornale di Roma&quot; with a semi-official &quot;rhetorical&quot; publication. In early 1861, controversialist Nicola Zanchini and journalist Giuseppe Bastia were granted editorial direction of Pacelli&#x27;s newspaper. Official permission to publish was sought on 22 June 1861, and four days later, on 26 June, Pius IX gave his approval for the regulation of &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore&quot;.

The first edition was entitled &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; – a political and moral paper&quot; and cost five baiocchi. The &quot;political and moral paper&quot; epithet was dropped before 1862, adding instead the two Latin mottoes that still appear under the masthead today.

After the breach of Porta Pia by Italian troops in September 1870, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; solidified its opposition to the Kingdom of Italy, affirming obedience to the Pope and adherence to his directives, stating it would remain faithful &quot;to that unchangeable principle of religion and morals which recognises as its sole depository and claimant the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth&quot;.

===20th century===

The Osservatore continued to be published as a newspaper in Vatican City, but in 1904, &quot;Acta Sanctae Sedis&quot;, which had existed since 1865, was declared the formal organ of the Holy See in that all documents printed in it were considered &quot;authentic and official&quot;. &quot;Acta Sanctae Sedis&quot; ceased publication four years later and on 29 September 1908 &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot; became the official publication of the Holy See.

The English weekly edition was first published on 4 April 1968. On 7 January 1998, that edition became the first to be printed outside of Rome, when for North American subscribers, it began to be printed in Baltimore. The edition was printed by the Cathedral Foundation, publishers of &quot;The Catholic Review&quot;.

===21st century===
As of 1 July 2011, the English language edition of the &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; for North American subscribers is once again published in Rome. 

In the 21st century, the paper has taken a more objective and subdued stance than at the time of its foundation, priding itself in &quot;presenting the genuine face of the church and the ideals of freedom&quot;, following the statement by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone in an October 2006 speech inaugurating a new exhibit dedicated to the founding and history of the newspaper. He further described the publication as &quot;an instrument for spreading the teachings of the successor of Peter and for information about church events&quot;.

On 27 June 2015, Pope Francis, in an apostolic letter, established the Secretariat for Communications, a new part of the Roman Curia, and included &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; under its management.

==Relation with the Magisterium==
It is a common error to assume that the contents of the &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; represent the views of the Magisterium, or the official position of the Holy See. In general, this is not the case, and the only parts of the &quot;Osservatore&quot; which represent the views of the Holy See are those that appear under the titles &quot;Nostre Informazioni&quot; or &quot;Santa Sede&quot;. At times the Magisterium disputes the contents of the &quot;Osservatore&quot;, e.g. a 2008 article expressed the desire that the debate on brain death be re‑opened because of new developments in the medical world. An official spokesman said that the article presented a personal opinion of the author and &quot;did not reflect a change in the Catholic Church&#x27;s position&quot;.

<text>C. William O&#x27;Neill (February 14, 1916 – August 20, 1978) was an American judge and Republican politician, who served as the 59th governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
C. William O&#x27;Neill was born in Marietta, Ohio on February 14, 1916. He was the 59th Governor of Ohio. He graduated from both Marietta College (1938) and Ohio State University Moritz College of Law (1942). While at Marietta he joined The Delta Upsilon University.

O&#x27;Neill served as a state representative and as Speaker of the House. He was then elected the State Attorney General in 1950, being the youngest person elected to the office at age 34. He served from 1951 to 1957, when he was elected to the governorship. O&#x27;Neill served until 1959. He was defeated for re-election due to his support of the controversial proposed &quot;right to work&quot; amendment to the Ohio Constitution. He served on the Ohio Supreme Court from 1960 until his death serving as an associate justice, then chief justice. O&#x27;Neill was the only Ohioan to serve in top leadership positions in the legislative, executive and judicial branches of Ohio.

O&#x27;Neill was married to Betty Hewson on July 29, 1945, and they had two children. He died on August 20, 1978, and his funeral service was at First Community Church in Columbus. He was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Marietta.

==Legacy==
The O&#x27;Neill Building at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of O&#x27;Neill. Additionally, The C. William O&#x27;Neill Senior Citizens Center in Marietta, Ohio is named in his honor.

<doc id="699204" wikidata="Q880797" url="?curid=699204" title="John William Brown">
<text>John William Brown (December 28, 1913October 29, 1993) was an American Republican politician from Ohio. He briefly served as the 58th governor of Ohio from January 3, 1957 to January 14, 1957 and served as the 51st and 54th lieutenant governor of Ohio.

Brown also served as mayor of Medina, in the Ohio House, and in the Ohio Senate.

==Lieutenant governor==
John W. Brown is Ohio&#x27;s longest serving lieutenant governor, having served under three different governors from 1953 to 1957 and 1963 to 1975. In 1952, he unseated the incumbent lieutenant governor, Democrat George D. Nye, and took office in 1953. (At the time, the office of lieutenant governor was elected separately from the office of governor). Brown defeated Nye again in 1954 to win a second two-year term.

In 1956, instead of seeking another term as lieutenant governor, Brown ran for the gubernatorial nomination against state Attorney General C. William O&#x27;Neill. Brown lost badly in the primary, getting only 27.5% of the vote to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 72.5%.

==Governor of Ohio==
In January 1957, as Brown was about to leave the lieutenant governorship, Frank J. Lausche, the Democratic governor of Ohio, resigned to take a seat in the United States Senate, which he had won in the 1956 general election. Brown, thus, was elevated to the office of governor. Lausche&#x27;s successor, C. William O&#x27;Neill (who had defeated Brown in the gubernatorial primary), had already been elected, at the same time that Lausche won his Senate seat; however, at the time, the U.S. Senate term began on January 3, but the Ohio gubernatorial term did not end until January 14.

Into the breach stepped the outgoing lieutenant governor. Brown took his eleven-day-long governorship very seriously. He moved into the governor&#x27;s mansion, summoned the General Assembly to hear his state of the state address, demanded and received the governor&#x27;s salary for the eleven days, and deposited five boxes of gubernatorial papers with the Ohio Historical Society. Among papers was a letter, on gubernatorial letter-head, to Columbus mayor M. E. Sensenbrenner, asking him to take care of a parking ticket. There was also a letter to then-President Eisenhower asking for a federal job after his eleven days in the governor&#x27;s office were complete.

==Later career==

In 1958, Brown was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1959 to 1961. He won election to the lieutenant governorship again in 1962, and served another three terms (by this time, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s term had been extended to four years), from 1963 to 1975. In 1974, Brown lost his bid for another term to Richard F. Celeste.

After serving as lieutenant governor, Brown worked to reactivate, and became the first commandant of, the Ohio Naval Militia.

==Legacy==
Brown Arena at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of Brown.

<text>National Treasure is a 2004 American action-adventure heist film released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was written by Jim Kouf and the Wibberleys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by Jon Turteltaub. It is the first film in the &quot;National Treasure&quot; franchise and stars Nicolas Cage in the lead role, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha and Christopher Plummer. In the film, Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian, along with computer expert Riley Poole and archivist Abigail Chase, search for a massive lost Freemason treasure, which includes a map hidden on the back of the United States Declaration of Independence.

&quot;National Treasure&quot; was released worldwide on November 19, 2004. The film grossed $347 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action scenes and performances of Cage and Bartha, but criticized the screenplay. A sequel, &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;, was released in 2007.

At the 2022 D23 Expo, a sequel television series, &quot;National Treasure: Edge of History&quot;, was announced. It was released on the Disney+ streaming service from December 14, 2022 to February 8, 2023.

==Plot==

Benjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, cryptographer, and treasure hunter. When Ben was young, his grandfather John told him a story about a fabled treasure hidden in America passed down from ancient times to the Knights Templar, Founding Fathers, and Freemasons. In 1832, Charles Carroll passed on a secret clue to their ancestor and could lead anyone to the treasure with the phrase &quot;the secret lies with Charlotte&quot;. While the story convinces Ben, his skeptical father, Patrick, dismisses it as nonsense.

Ben and his friend, computer expert Riley Poole, head an expedition financed by wealthy Englishman Ian Howe to find the &quot;Charlotte&quot;, revealed to be a ship lost in the Arctic. Within the ship, they find a meerschaum pipe, whose engravings reveal the next clue is on the Declaration of Independence. When Ian reveals himself as a crime boss and suggests stealing the Declaration, a fight ensues, and the group splits. Ben and Riley report Ian&#x27;s plan to the FBI and Dr. Abigail Chase of the National Archives but are not believed. Ben decides to protect the Declaration by removing it from the Archives&#x27; preservation room during a gala event before Ian does. Obtaining Abigail&#x27;s fingerprints, he successfully obtains the Declaration, but he is spotted by Ian&#x27;s group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the gift shop but has to pay for the Declaration when the cashier mistakes it for a souvenir copy. Suspecting something amiss, Abigail confronts Ben and takes back the document. Ian promptly kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a souvenir copy of the Declaration. The FBI, led by Special Agent Peter Sadusky, begins tracking Ben.

Going to Patrick&#x27;s house, the trio studies the Declaration and discovers a book cipher written in invisible ink. The message refers to Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s Silence Dogood letters. Patrick formerly owned them but donated them to the Franklin Institute. Paying a schoolboy to view the letters and decipher the code for them, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of Independence Hall. Pursued by Ian, they find a brick containing a pair of spectacles with multiple colored lenses, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveal a clue pointing to Trinity Church. Ian&#x27;s associates chase the trio through Philadelphia until the FBI arrests Ben. Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian, but Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, contacts the FBI, and arranges a meeting at the USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;, where they help Ben evade the FBI.

Ian returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has taken Patrick hostage. They travel to the Trinity Church, where they find an underground passage that appears to lead to a dead end, lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is a reference to the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, pointing Ian to the Old North Church in Boston, a claim that Ben supports. Ian traps the group in the chamber and leaves for Boston, after which Ben and Patrick reveal it was a false clue to get him out of the way. Ben then finds a notch the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, with a staircase to the surface. Ben meets up with Sadusky—who is actually a Freemason—at ground level to return the Declaration. In exchange for dropping the charges on him and Abigail, Ben wants to donate the treasure to museums worldwide, crediting the Gates family and Riley for the discovery and Ian&#x27;s arrest in place of his own. On a tip from Ben, the FBI finds Ian in Boston, breaking into the Old North Church, and arrests him and his henchmen on the spot.

Later, Ben and Abigail start a relationship, and Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder&#x27;s fee for the treasure. However, the 1% he did accept has still netted them all significant wealth.

==Production==

===Development===
By early 1999, it was revealed that Jon Turteltaub was developing &quot;National Treasure&quot; based upon an idea developed by Oren Aviv and Charles Segars in 1997, with a script by Jim Kouf. By 2001, the project was relocated to Touchstone Pictures.
In May 2003, Nicolas Cage was cast as the lead. New drafts were written by nine scribers, including Cormac and Marianne Wibberley, E. Max Frye, and Jon Turteltaub. By October, Sean Bean was cast.

===Filming locations===
&quot;National Treasure&quot; was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, Washington, New York, Philadelphia and Utah. Most scenes were filmed on location, with the exceptions of the Independence Hall scene, portions of which were filmed at the replica of Independence Hall at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, and the Arctic scene, which was filmed in Utah.

==Soundtrack==


==Portrayal of the Declaration of Independence==
The film&#x27;s suggestion that the original Declaration of Independence still has clearly visible ink is inaccurate. The document&#x27;s ink faded over time due to exposure to damaging lighting, with little ink still existing by 1876.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;National Treasure&quot; earned $11 million on its opening day in the United States, ahead of Paramount &amp; Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (which earned $9,559,752). It grossed $35,142,554 during its opening weekend, on 4,300 screens at 3,243 theaters, averaging $11,648 per venue. The film had the best opening weekend for a Disney film released in November until it was surpassed by &quot;Chicken Little&quot; in 2005. It held on to the No. 1 spot for three weekends. In Japan, &quot;National Treasure&quot; bested the double-billing &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior: Program of Light and Dark&quot; and &quot;Duel Masters: Curse of the Deathphoenix&quot;, grossing $11,666,763 in its first week. The film closed on June 2, 2005, with a domestic gross of $173,008,894 and earning $174,503,424 internationally. Worldwide, &quot;National Treasure&quot; grossed over $347,512,318, against a budget of $100 million.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 46% based on 179 reviews, and an average rating of 5.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;National Treasure&quot; is no treasure, but it&#x27;s a fun ride for those who can forgive its highly improbable plot.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2/4 stars, calling it &quot;so silly that the Monty Python version could use the same screenplay, line for line.&quot; Academic David Bordwell has expressed a liking for the film, placing it in the tradition of 1950s Disney children&#x27;s adventure movies, and using it as the basis for an essay on scene transitions in classical Hollywood cinema.

==Accolades==

==Home media==
&quot;National Treasure&quot; was released on Disney DVD in May 2005. In keeping with the movie&#x27;s theme, the DVD contains a &quot;Bonus Treasure Hunt&quot;: viewers who watch the Special Features on the disc are rewarded with puzzles and codes that unlock more features.

===Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD===
To help promote &quot;Book of Secrets&quot;, a special collector&#x27;s edition, two-disc DVD set of the movie was released on December 18, 2007. The set features a bonus disc containing additional deleted scenes and documentaries.

===Blu-ray===
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Blu-ray versions of &quot;National Treasure&quot; and its sequel, &quot;National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets&quot;, on May 20, 2008.

==Sequels==

Although the DVD commentary stated that there were no plans for a sequel, the film&#x27;s box office gross of an unexpected $347.5 million worldwide warranted a second film, which was given the green light in 2005. &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot; was released on December 21, 2007.

In 2008, director Jon Turteltaub said that the filmmaking team would take its time on another &quot;National Treasure&quot; sequel. In October 2013, Turteltaub confirmed that he, the studio, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and the actors all wanted to do a third film, saying: &quot;We want to do the movie, Disney wants to do the movie. We&#x27;re just having the damnedest time writing it. I&#x27;ll bet that within two years, we&#x27;ll be shooting that movie. I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re about halfway there.&quot; In May 2016, Cage confirmed the film was still in the writing process, and in July 2018, Turtletaub reiterated that a script for a possible third film was &quot;close&quot;, but Disney still was not completely sold on it. In January 2020, it was announced that Chris Bremner, the writer of &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;, would write a new script.

In May 2020, Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed that, not only was there a third film in development with the original cast returning, but also that a Disney+ series was in the works with the same premise as the original, but focusing on a much younger cast.

In an April 2022 &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; thread on Reddit, Cage responded to a question about his involvement in possible future installments: &quot;No, the priority was to turn it into a TV show so I would say probably not.&quot;

<text>BankBoston was a bank based in Boston, Massachusetts, which was created by the 1996 merger of Bank of Boston and BayBank. One of its predecessor banks started in 1784, but the merged BankBoston was short-lived, being acquired by FleetBoston Financial in 1999. In 2005, FleetBoston was purchased by, and merged into, Bank of America of Charlotte, North Carolina.

After the sale of its Latin American branches in 2006, BankBoston currently exists solely as a subsidiary private bank owned by Bank of America.

==History==
The history of BankBoston represents the combination of dozens of banks throughout the New England region acquired over the course of more than two centuries. Among its notable predecessors were the Massachusetts Bank, the First National Bank of Boston, the Old Colony Trust Company and BayBank.

===The Massachusetts Bank===
Bank of Boston traced its roots back to The Massachusetts Bank founded in 1784. The Massachusetts Bank was the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States and only the second bank to receive a charter in the United States, after the Bank of North America. The bank&#x27;s charter was signed by John Hancock and among its early account holders were such notable figures as Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Henry Knox. The bank&#x27;s founders were largely made up of merchants who wanted to use a U.S., rather than British bank to send money abroad. It was first headquartered at the old Manufactory House, near Boston Common. The bank was the only bank in the city of Boston until the Union Bank (later the Bank of New England) was founded in 1792.

In 1786, the Massachusetts Bank financed the first U.S. trade mission to China, and in 1791, it financed the first voyage of an American ship to Argentina, establishing what would become a long-standing presence in Latin America. Bank of Boston would later become the largest foreign bank in several major Latin American cities.

In 1864, The Massachusetts Bank was renamed the Massachusetts National Bank.

===First National Bank of Boston ===

In 1903, The Massachusetts Bank merged with The First National Bank of Boston amidst a wave of consolidation in the banking industry at the start of the 20th century. First National had been founded in 1859 as Safety Fund Bank, changing its name in 1864 when it joined the national bank system. After a year operating as The Massachusetts First National Bank of Boston, the combined firm dropped the usage of &quot;Massachusetts&quot; in the name.

On December 24, 1927, Bank of Boston&#x27;s headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina, were blown up by the Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, in the frame of the international campaign supporting Sacco and Vanzetti.

Despite the Wall Street crash of 1929, the First National Bank of Boston continued to grow in 1929, purchasing the Old Colony Trust Company. However, following the passage of the Glass–Steagall legislation in 1933, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and securities dealing, First National Bank of Boston was forced to divest its investment banking arm, the First Boston Corporation.

In 1970 the Bank of Boston reorganized under a new holding company, First National Boston Corporation, and began a series of acquisitions of regional banks through the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978, the bank challenged a Massachusetts law limiting bank contributions to political issues. The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the bank that their First Amendment rights were being restricted, in &quot;First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti&quot;. In 1982, the bank renamed itself Bank of Boston. In 1985 Bank of Boston acquired Connecticut-based Colonial Bancorp and in 1987 acquired BankVermont Corporation.

===Acquisition of BayBank to form BankBoston===
By the 1990s, Bank of Boston was looking to make another large acquisition, hoping to make itself too rich to be acquired by a much larger player. However, the bank lost the bidding in 1991 for the failed Bank of New England to Fleet Bank, and its attempted merger with Shawmut Bank collapsed in early 1992. In 1994, Bank of Boston entered into discussions with Fleet about a potential merger but ultimately Fleet chose to merge with Shawmut in 1995. This merger made Fleet the largest bank in Boston and New England.

In 1995, Bank of Boston announced a merger with BayBank, another local financial institution. Although still smaller than its failed takeover targets earlier in the decade, BayBank had a strong retail banking operation, with 205 branches and over a thousand ATMs. Baybanks was founded in 1928 when a Massachusetts asset manager with controlling stakes in nine banks reorganized itself as Old Colony Trust. After successfully weathering the Great Depression, Old Colony Trust changed its name to Baystate Corporation. This reflected the widening scope of operations and services the firm provided throughout Massachusetts. In the 1950s and 1960s, Baystate engaged in an aggressive acquisitions strategy and bought more than 40 banks. In 1976 the bank&#x27;s name was changed from Baystate to BayBanks, Inc. BayBanks derived 80 percent of its revenues from its retail business, with 31% of households in eastern Massachusetts, and 25% across the entire state, having at least one BayBanks account.

Following the merger, the combined Bank of Boston did regain the title as the largest bank in the city of Boston from its rival Fleet Bank although Fleet was still the larger bank overall. With the addition of BayBank&#x27;s $11 billion of assets, the combined bank had total assets of over $62 billion at the end of 1996.

The combined bank, rebranded BankBoston in 1996, was a major financial institution both domestically and internationally, due in part to the Latin American holdings of Bank of Boston, where the old name was still used. Nonetheless, it would soon be subsumed by one of the many U.S. bank mergers that proliferated in the 1990s.

In August 1998 BankBoston acquired Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. from BankAmerica Corporation for approximately $800 million. The transaction represented the second largest acquisition in company history, after the purchase of BayBank.

===Bank of New York===
On 26 October 1999, Bank of New York gained BankBoston Panama as its subcustodian bank in Panama. Beginning in 1996, the 1973 established BankBoston Panama provided custody services to non-resident investors in Panama.

===Merger with Fleet===
Boston-based Fleet Bank (originally Providence Bank, founded in Rhode Island in 1791) acquired BankBoston in 1999, on the heels of acquiring Shawmut Bank just a few years earlier. Fleet now dominated the New England market, yet saw the value in maintaining the old Bank of Boston brand in Latin America.

The combination of Fleet and BankBoston resulted in what was the eighth largest bank in the United States at the time, with assets of over $190 billion. Between the acquisitions by Fleet and BankBoston, the combined bank had consumed eight of the ten largest banks in New England at the start of the 1990s.

The merged entity, FleetBoston Financial, adopted BankBoston&#x27;s former Boston headquarters as its own. The bank had branches throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states. In 2000, FleetBoston acquired Summit Bancorp of Princeton, New Jersey. The acquisition of Summit, New Jersey&#x27;s largest remaining bank at the time, vaulted FleetBoston into the #1 market-share position in the state of New Jersey and provided critical mass in the Philadelphia metro area.

===Acquisition by Bank of America===
In 2004, FleetBoston in turn was purchased by Bank of America, which was looking to expand its East Coast presence. Bank of America chose to unload Bank of Boston&#x27;s historic Latin American assets (still branded as BankBoston), in order to focus on becoming one of the largest U.S. domestic banks.

On 17 December 2004, Bank of America sold its BankBoston (BKB) operations in Peru, Colombia, and Panama to the 1955 established Panamanian private equity bank &quot;Banco General&quot;.

In 2006, Bank of America sold all BankBoston&#x27;s Brazilian assets to Brazilian bank Banco Itaú, in exchange for Itaú shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America.
In August 2006, Itaú purchased BankBoston assets in Chile and Uruguay. Operations in these countries continued to use the BankBoston brand until Banco Itau completed its takeover in Chile on February 27, 2007, and in Uruguay on March 23, 2007.

In December 2006, Argentina&#x27;s central bank approved Bank of America&#x27;s sale of BankBoston Argentina to South Africa&#x27;s Standard Bank. With the finalization of the sale on April 3, 2007, the BankBoston brand ceased to exist in any branches (in 2012 an 80% stake was sold by Standard Bank to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China).

BankBoston currently exists solely as an international private bank, a subsidiary owned by Bank of America.

<text>Ernest Shurtleff Holmes (January 21, 1887 – April 7, 1960) was an American New Thought writer, teacher, and leader. He was the founder of a spiritual movement known as Religious Science, part of the greater New Thought movement, whose spiritual philosophy is known as &quot;The Science of Mind.&quot; He was the author of &quot;The Science of Mind&quot; and numerous other metaphysical books, and the founder of &quot;Science of Mind&quot; magazine, in continuous publication since 1927. His books remain in print, and the principles he taught as &quot;Science of Mind&quot; have inspired and influenced many generations of metaphysical students and teachers. Holmes had previously studied another New Thought teaching, Divine Science, and was an ordained Divine Science Minister. His influence beyond New Thought can be seen in the self-help movement.

== Biography ==
Holmes was born January 21, 1887, in Lincoln, Maine, to a poor family. He was the son of Anna Columbia (Heath) and William Nelson Holmes. He left school and his family in Maine for Boston at the age of 15. From 1908 to 1910 he worked in a store to pay for his tuition at the Leland Powers School of Expression in Boston. There he was introduced to Mary Baker Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Science and Health&quot;, as well as Christian Science.

In 1912 Holmes joined his brother Fenwicke in Venice, California. In addition to taking up a job with the city government, Holmes and his brother, a Congregationalist minister, studied the writings of Thomas Troward, Ralph Waldo Emerson, William Walker Atkinson, and Christian D. Larson.

In 1927 Holmes married Hazel Durkee Foster. She died in 1957. He died on April 7, 1960.

=== Religious Science/Science of Mind ===

After leading small private meetings throughout the city, in 1916 Holmes was invited to speak at the Metaphysical Library in Los Angeles. This led him to repeat engagements, and on a nationwide tour. In 1919 he published his first book, &quot;The Creative Mind&quot;, and after almost a decade of touring, Holmes committed to remaining in the L.A. area to complete his major work, &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;. It was published in 1926.

That year Holmes started speaking each Sunday morning in a theatre in the Ambassador Hotel that seated 625. In November 1927, they moved to the 1,295-seat Ebell Theatre. Subsequently, Holmes&#x27; lectures continued moving to ever-larger spaces, including the Biltmore Hotel, and the Wiltern Theatre, which seats more than 2800. In February 1927, Holmes incorporated the Institute of Religious Science and School of Philosophy, Inc., and later that year he began publishing &quot;Science of Mind&quot; magazine. In 1935 he reincorporated his organization as the Institute of Religious Science and Philosophy, and in 1954 it was reestablished again as a religious organization called the Church of Religious Science.

Today his Science of Mind/Religious Science teachings are continued by the Centers for Spiritual Living, the Affiliated New Thought Network, the Global Religious Science Ministries, Independent Religious Science ministries, and other organizations. In 2015, his books &quot;Creative Mind&quot; and &quot;Creative Mind and Success&quot; were narrated by Hillary Hawkins and published in audiobook form.

== Philosophy ==
Holmes taught New Thought in a Christian context in his church. The primary teaching of New Thought is that physical form is created by a Universal Mind, or God, which manifests—or literally reflects—the dominant belief system of all living persons. In his book, &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;, Holmes described this God-force as follows: 

Holmes argued that human beings have access to the power of this Universal Mind by directing their thoughts—in particular, their beliefs about the present or the future. In his book, he described this as follows: 

In his book, &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;, Holmes explains how it is possible to direct this power by controlling one&#x27;s thoughts. A sustained belief in a particular outcome will invariably create that outcome. In other words, good events proceed from a belief in good. Evil events proceed from a belief in evil. In &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;, Holmes emphasized the importance of only focusing on good: 
In order to get results, Holmes emphasized that it was necessary to think one specific thought, with complete certainty. If one is continually thinking different thoughts, the Universal Mind will not have a dominant belief that it can manifest, or create, in the physical world. Holmes explained this idea as follows, in his book, &quot;Creative Mind&quot;:

== Statement of Beliefs ==
In the 1920s, Holmes published the following statement of beliefs:

Through his research, Holmes created a &quot;structure of concepts&quot; based on the religions and philosophies of human history, sometimes correlating his findings with the then-emerging &quot;new&quot; physics. He named the teaching a science because he believed that its principles were scientifically provable in practice. He wrote, &quot;I would rather see a student of this Science prove its Principle than to have him repeat all the words of wisdom that have ever been uttered.&quot;

Holmes ultimately came to believe in a &quot;core concept&quot; – what he saw as a &quot;Golden thread of truth&quot; that ran through all of the world&#x27;s religions as well as in science and philosophy.

== Recognition ==

Holmes received a variety of recognitions for his work. In 1945, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Andhra University in India. The California College of Medicine, and the Foundation Academic University of Spiritual Understanding in Venice, Italy, awarded him a Doctor of Letters. In 1942, he was bestowed with the Cross of the Commander of the Grand Humanitarian Prize of Belgium, and in 1944 he was named an honorary member of the Eugene Field Society.

<text>Frank John Lausche (; November 14, 1895 – April 21, 1990) was an American Democratic politician from Ohio. He served as the 47th mayor of Cleveland and the 55th and 57th governor of Ohio, and also served as a United States Senator from Ohio for two terms (1957–1969).

==Youth and baseball career==
Lausche was born on November 14, 1895, in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Frances (née Milavec) and Louis Lausche. His family was of Slovenian origin. Lausche attended St. Vitus Grade School grades one to four, St. Francis Grade School in grade five and Madison Grammar School grades six to eight. He then went to Central Institute Preparatory School. He dropped out of school in 1911, when his older brother died, to help support his family. He played baseball locally when not working, and was recruited as a third baseman to the amateur White Motor team, which won a national championship. He was noticed by scouts and reported to the Duluth White Sox in Duluth, Minnesota, of the Class D Northern League in the spring of 1916. He started the season batting .422, but developed trouble hitting curve balls, and was released after 31 games. He signed with a semi-pro team in Virginia, Minnesota. He performed poorly for two weeks before returning to Cleveland, and amateur ball.

During the spring of 1917, Lausche reported to the Class B Lawrence Barristers, Lawrence, Massachusetts, of the Eastern League. He started well, but was released after 27 games. He enlisted in the United States Army that summer, and reported to Camp Gordon, near Atlanta, Georgia. He was noticed playing baseball, and was asked to join the camp baseball team. He was promoted to second lieutenant after eight months, and assigned to officers&#x27; training school. His high batting average &quot;spared him a trip across the ocean to the front lines.&quot; The team manager at the camp was Charles Frank, who in peacetime owned and managed the Atlanta Crackers of the Class AA Southern Association. After World War I ended in November, 1918, but before Lausche was discharged in January, 1919, Frank offered Lausche a six-month contract, at $225 per month if he would report at spring training. Lausche had also completed high school while in the Army.

==Legal career==
Lausche entered the Cleveland-Marshall School of Law early on 1919, and decided to continue in law school that spring, rather than report to spring training. He graduated from the law school in 1921. He was ranked second in his class at John Marshall School of Law and quickly became known as one of Cleveland&#x27;s better trial lawyers. Lausche served as Municipal Court judge from 1932 to 1937 and Common Pleas Court judge from 1937 to 1941, before winning election as Mayor of Cleveland in 1941.

==Governor==
He served until 1944, when he first won election as governor of Ohio, the state&#x27;s first Roman Catholic in that position. Lausche served as governor from 1945 to 1947, when he narrowly lost to Thomas J. Herbert. Lausche defeated Herbert in a 1948 rematch, however, and served four consecutive two-year terms from 1949 to 1957. He was reelected as governor in 1950, defeating state Treasurer Don H. Ebright; in 1952, defeating Cincinnati Mayor Charles Phelps Taft II; and in 1954, defeating state Auditor Jim Rhodes, who later became governor himself. Lausche resigned in early 1957, having won election to the United States Senate in November 1956, unseating incumbent Republican George Bender.

==U.S. Senator==

In his first term, with the Senate almost evenly split, Lausche gave Senate Democratic leader Lyndon B. Johnson a scare by hinting that he might vote for Republican William F. Knowland for Senate Majority Leader, although he ultimately did not. Throughout his career, Lausche displayed a bipartisan and independent approach to politics, being known by some as a &quot;Democrat with a small &#x27;d&#x27;&quot;, but his approach to ethnic Democratic politics paved the way for followers such as Ralph S. Locher, who became Mayor of Cleveland and later an associate justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, and Bronis Klementowicz, a leader of Cleveland City Council and law director under Locher.

Lausche&#x27;s independence also earned him, among some, the derisive moniker, &quot;Frank the Fence.&quot; He was easily re-elected to the Senate in 1962, but was defeated in his bid for renomination in 1968, due to his loss of labor union support. He lost the Democratic primary against former Congressman John J. Gilligan by a 55% to 45% margin, and in the general election, Lausche refused to support Gilligan, who went on to lose the general election to then-state Attorney General William B. Saxbe.

Lausche was a very popular, plain-spoken, big-city politician of the old school. He was credited with building a coalition of ethnic voters in Cleveland known as the &quot;cosmopolitan Democrats.&quot; There is some evidence that Republican presidential candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 considered asking Lausche to become his running mate and is said to have been considered in the Republican 1956 campaign by Leonard W. Hall in a presidential meeting.

==Retirement and death==
In retirement, Lausche and his wife, Jane, lived in Bethesda, Maryland. Jane Lausche died November 24, 1981, and, having converted to the Roman Catholic faith, was buried at Calvary Cemetery in southeast Cleveland. Lausche continued to live in Bethesda until contracting pneumonia in January 1990. He was flown back to Cleveland, and was admitted to the Slovenian Home for the Aged on February 20, where he died of congestive heart failure on April 21, 1990, at the age of 94.

Lausche&#x27;s funeral was at St. Vitus Church, with Bishop Anthony Edward Pevec delivering the homily. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery. His tombstone was incorrectly inscribed with a birth date of 1898.

==Honours and legacy==
Lausche was named a Knight of St John of Malta by Pope John Paul II, &quot;the highest civilian honor that can be bestowed by the Catholic Church&quot;.

The State of Ohio&#x27;s office building in Cleveland, Ohio is named after Lausche, as is the Lausche Building at the Ohio Expo Center (site of the Ohio State Fair). In 2005, James E. Odenkirk authored the book &quot;Frank J. Lausche: Ohio&#x27;s Great Political Maverick&quot;, an in-depth look at Lausche&#x27;s political career. In the early 1990s, &quot;Ohio&#x27;s Lincoln&quot; was published.

Lausche Avenue (formerly Glass Avenue), a street that spans between East 60th and East 64th Streets adjacent St. Vitus church in the St. Clair-Superior neighborhood on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side, is named for Lausche, whose family were members of the parish as well as residents of the neighborhood.

A bust of Lausche is displayed at St. Mary of the Assumption Church in Cleveland&#x27;s Collinwood neighborhood, and an exhibit of Lausche artifacts is displayed at Cleveland&#x27;s Slovenian Museum and Archives.

<doc id="699227" wikidata="Q2424159" url="?curid=699227" title="Mleccha">
<text>Mleccha () is a Sanskrit term referring to those of an incomprehensible speech, foreigners or invaders deemed distinct and separate from the Vedic tribes. In Vedic Brahmanical discourse, the term is used to refer to foreigners (anāryans) who are considered outside the realm of Vedic dharma.

The word Mleccha was commonly used for foreign non vedic people of whatever race or colour. As a &quot;mleccha&quot; is any foreigner who stood outside the varna system and the ritual ambience. The Mleccha people were Śākas, Huns, Chinese, Greeks, Kambojas, Pahlavas, Bahlikas, Rishikas and Daradas. The Barbaras, Kiratas, Paradas, Saka-Greeks, Indo-Greeks, Pulindas, Scythians, Kushans, Kinnaras, Tusharas, Nishadas, Türks, Mongols, Romans, Balochs and Arabs were also mlecchas.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;mleccha&quot; does not have a standard Indo-European etymology and has no counterpart in Iranian languages. 
It is composed of two roots Mala (filth/impurity) and Ichha (desire) referring to the one who loves filth, probably referring to the Non Vedic lifestyle of foreigners which Indo Aryans considered as impure and filthy. However, it has cognates in Middle Indo-Aryan languages: Pali &quot;milakkha&quot;, and Prakrit &quot;mliccha&quot;, from the latter of which originate Sindhi &quot;milis&quot;, Punjabi &quot;milech&quot;, Kashmiri &quot;brichun&quot; (weep or lament), Western Pahari &quot;melech&quot; (dirty), Odia &quot;mḷecha&quot;, Bengali &quot;myaloch (dirty)&quot;. The Sanskrit word occurs as a verb &quot;mlecchati&quot; for the first time in the latic Vedic text &quot;Śathapatha‐Brāhmaṇa&quot; dated to around 700 BCE. It is taken to mean to speak indistinctly or barbarously. Brahmins are prohibited from speaking in this fashion.

As &quot;mleccha&quot; does not have an Indo-European etymology, scholars infer that it must have been a self-designation of a non-Aryan people within India. Based on the geographic references to the &quot;Mleccha deśa&quot; (Mleccha country) to the west, the term is identified with the Indus people, whose land is known from the Sumerian texts as Meluḫḫa. Asko Parpola has proposed a Dravidian derivation for &quot;Meluḫḫa&quot;, as &quot;mel-akam&quot; (&quot;high country&quot;, a possible etymological relationship and reference to Balochistan from where originated the Indus Valley Civilization. Franklin Southworth suggests that mleccha comes from &quot;mizi&quot; meaning &#x27;speak&#x27;, or &#x27;one&#x27;s speech&#x27; derived from Proto-Dravidian for language.

Pali, the older Prakrit used by Theravada Buddhism, uses the term &quot;milakkha&quot;. It also employs &quot;milakkhu&quot;, a borrowing from a Dramatic Prakrit.

==Language==
Some explanations of the name &quot;mleccha&quot; suggest that the word was derived from the Indo-Aryan perception of the speech of the indigenous peoples. Namely, &quot;mlech&quot; was a word that meant &#x27;to speak indistinctly&#x27;. As such, some suggest that the Indo-Aryans used an onomatopoeic sound to imitate the harshness of alien tongue and to indicate incomprehension, thus coming up with &quot;mleccha&quot;.

Early Indo-Aryans spoke Sanskrit, which evolved into the various local modern Sanskrit-derived languages. Sanskrit was believed to include all the sounds necessary for communication. Early Indo-Aryans would therefore dismiss other languages as foreign tongue &quot;mleccha bhasha&quot;. As the Sanskrit word itself suggests, mlecchas were those whose speech was alien. Correct speech was a crucial component of being able to take part in the appropriate &quot;yajñas&quot; (religious rituals and sacrifices). Thus, without correct speech, one could not hope to practice correct religion, either.

The notion of being Arya suggested a knowledge of Sanskrit in order to effectively perform ritual hymns; thus suggesting the importance of language. Parasher discusses the importance of knowing the &quot;correct speech&quot; in order to perform sacrifice and ritual in the religion of the &quot;brahmanas&quot;. Parasher continued, &quot;The best experts of the sacrificial art were undoubtedly the various families of the Brahmins who, placed in a hierarchy within the Indo-Aryan social system, became the upholders of pure and best speech&quot;.

Historians note that early Indo-Aryans believed Sanskrit to be the superior language over all other forms of speech. As such, mleccha or barbarian speech was said to have meant any of the following:
# a language which was not necessarily alien, but the speech of the person or persons was improper because it was either hostile or vulgar
# a language, and here most probably Sanskrit, that was mispronounced and, thereby, incomprehensible
# finally, any foreign tongue which was naturally incomprehensible because it was unintelligible to those who did not understand a particular language.

==Territory==
Historians have stated that the notion of foreigners in ancient India – those living outside of the Indian subcontinent – was often accompanied by the idea that one was a barbarian. Still, it seemed that groups who did not come from outside of these areas, as well as foreigners, were designated by the term &quot;mleccha&quot;, which carried with it a barbarian connotation.

Thus another distinction that was made between the mlecchas and non-mlecchas was area of habitation. Though they were considered a marginal group, the area characterize as the mleccha-desa (the natural border that separated their lands from that of the Aryans) was never permanent. Instead, it was defined by the changing ideas about the Āryāvarta. Parasher noted that the only consistent areas dubbed as &quot;mleccha desa&quot; were those regions inhabited by primitive tribes who for long periods of time did not come under the sway of the Vedic, Buddhist or Jain influence.

Though the area of the Aryas expanded with time, the notion that was held over all of the land was that of purity. As Vedic literature refers only to the places and territories that were familiar to the Indo-Aryans, these lands eventually became part of the Āryāvarta. Parasher thus indicates that the Āryāvarta was designated as the region where the River Sarasvati disappears is the Patiala district in Punjab. The Pariyatra Mountains belong to the Vindhya Range, probably the hills of Malwa. The Kalakavana is identified with a tract somewhere near Prayag. Still, other interpretations of the Āryāvarta refer to those areas where the black antelope roams, for these areas are fit for the performance of sacrifice. Early Vedic literature focused on defining the area of habitation of the Aryas for this land was considered pure; yet there is no actual reference to the mleccha country or behavior. Wherever the territory, though, the implications of naming such lands as the Āryāvarta is that any lands excluded from that area were considered impure.

Further, there is evidence that Indians of the Vedic period actually had contact with people outside of the Indian subcontinent, namely the Persians. The Achaemenid Persian Empire, which ruled over the Indus River Valley during this time (522–486 BC) was not designated as mleccha, perhaps because they did not interfere with the Brahminical way of life.

Later Vedic literature speaks of the western Anava tribes as mlecchas and occupying northern Punjab, Sindh and eastern Rajputana. The tribes of the north were mlecchas either because they were located on the frontiers such as Gandhara, Kasmira, Kambojas, Khasas and therefore both their speech and culture had become contaminated and differed from that of Āryāvarta, or else, as in the case of southern India, they were once Aryas but having forsaken the Vedic rituals were regarded to mleccha status.

==Cultural behavior==

The word &quot;mleccha&quot; emerged as a way for the ancient Indo-Aryans to classify those who did not subscribe to the traditional value system, though the characteristics of this system were ambiguous. In sum, though, the idea was that the mlecchas were peoples who did not conform to what was culturally acceptable.

=== Relations with mlecchas ===

Early writings refer to these foreign peoples as half-civilized, unconverted people who rise or eat at improper times. They stated that monks and nuns should avoid certain areas of habitation because they were unsafe. Namely, that the ignorant populace might beat, harass or rob them under the impression that they were spies from hostile villages. Further, while some of these non-mlecchas, such as those of the Jain faith, had established contact with people of the forest tribes, they were automatically designated as mlecchas. This was the typical attitude of people from the plains who took pride in their norms of settled agricultural and urban lifestyles.

Historians note that there were also systems in place to determine the validity – or purity – of certain customs, which would ultimately be judged by the priest. As such there were intricate rules in place to define purity from impurity, laws of behavior, as well as rituals and customs, in an effort to educate the members of the Brahmanical system. Namely, these advisors took great pains to ensure that peoples of the Brahmanical system did not subscribe to any mleccha customs or rituals.

The Sanskritisation of names was a common feature among both indigenous and foreign mlecchas who slowly tried to move away from their status of mleccha. Very often, in the case of ruling families, it took one to two generations to make a transition. One of the most direct forms of the expression of the Brahmanical ritual purity was the form and type of food which a Brahmin could eat. He was forbidden to accept cooked food from any unclean person. Thus when the Punjab region became a mleccha area conquered by Muslims, the staple food was given a lower place in the food-ranking. By the twelfth century CE, wheat was described in one lexicon as food of the mlecchas, and rice became the pure cereal. Onions and garlic was also regarded as the food of the mlecchas and therefore prohibited to the priestly intellectual class of Brahmins. Mlecchas drank alcohol, ate cow flesh, which was strictly forbidden to a follower of Hindu orthopraxy, and followed spiritual practices which were foreign to the Indian subcontinent.

==Literature describing the Mleccha==
In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, some Mleccha warriors are described as having heads completely shaved or half-shaved or covered with matted locks, as being impure in habits, and of crooked faces and noses They are dwellers of hills and denizens of mountain-caves. Mlecchas were born of the cow (belonging to Vasishtha), of fierce eyes, accomplished in smiting looking like messengers of Death, and all conversant with the deceptive powers of the Asuras.

Swami Parmeshwaranand states the mleccha tribe was born from the tail of the celestial cow Nandini, kept by Vashishta for sacrificial purposes when there was a fight between Vishvamitra and Vasistha. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; gives the following information regarding them:
* Mleccha who sprang up from the tail of the celestial cow Nandini sent the army of Vishvamitra flying in terror.
* Bhagadatta was the king of mlecchas.
* Pandavas, like Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva once defeated them.
* Karna during his world campaign conquered many mleccha countries.
* The wealth that remained in the yaga-shala of Yudhishthira after the distribution as gifts to Brahmins was taken away by the mlecchas.
* The mlecchas drove angered elephants on the army of the Pandavas.
* This shows mlecchas were against Pandavas.

The term is not attested in the Vedas, but occurs for the first time in the late Vedic text the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;. The &quot;Baudhayana sutras&quot; define a mleccha as someone who eats beef or indulges in self-contradictory statements or is devoid of righteousness and purity of conduct.

Medieval Hindu literature, such as that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also uses the term to refer to those of larger groups of other religions, especially Muslims. In medieval India, a foreign visitor Al Birūnī (died 1048) noted that foreigners were regarded as unclean or Mleccha and Hindus were forbidden any social or matrimonial contact with them.

According to the Gwalior inscription of his descendant Mihira Bhoja, the Gurjara Pratihara King Nagabhata I repulsed a mleccha invasion. These mlechchhas are identified with the Arab Muslim invaders.

<text>DAA plc (styled &quot;daa&quot;) (), previously Dublin Airport Authority, is a commercial semi-state airport company in Ireland. The company owns and operates Dublin Airport and Cork Airport. Its other subsidiaries include the travel retail business Aer Rianta International and DAA International.

DAA&#x27;s head office is in the original passenger terminal on the grounds of Dublin Airport.

DAA owned and operated Shannon Airport, until it became a separate state-owned airport in 2012. The company also owned Great Southern Hotels, which had nine sites throughout the island of Ireland. The hotels were sold in 2006. 

==History==
=== Aer Rianta ===

Aer Rianta was founded in 1937 as &quot;Aer Rianta Teoranta&quot; and the name is derived from the Irish language for &quot;air ways&quot; or &quot;air tracks&quot;; &quot;Teoranta&quot; is the Irish word for &quot;Limited&quot;. Aer Rianta was to serve as a holding company for the national airline and to promote aviation generally.

In 1947, Aer Rianta started the duty-free shop concept in the Shannon Airport and are credited with the invention of duty-free shops in airports. Aer Rianta was the principal shareholder of Aer Lingus during the airline&#x27;s early days, until 1966.

Aer Rianta began managing the Dublin Airport in the 1940s. Under the Air Navigation and Transport Act of 1950, Aer Rianta was given legal responsibility for the airport. In 1954, Prof. Patrick Lynch was appointed chairman of Aer Rianta. He retired from the position in 1975.

In 1966, the passage of the Air Companies Act enabled the transfer of Aer Lingus shares to the Minister of Finance, and separate boards were appointed to each company. A general manager of Aer Rianta was appointed in 1968. On 1 April 1969, Cork and Shannon Airports became the responsibility of the company.

In 1988, Aer Rianta International (ARI) was created to pursue international potential to the company&#x27;s growth not related to Irish airport management – for example, opening Russia&#x27;s first duty free in Moscow in 1988. In 1998, &quot;Aer Rianta Teoranta&quot; became &quot;Aer Rianta cpt&quot; and kept this name until 2004.

=== Dublin Airport Authority/DAA ===
In 2004, the Oireachtas passed the &quot;State Airports Act, 2004&quot;. This changed the company name from &quot;Aer Rianta cpt&quot; to &quot;Dublin Airport Authority plc&quot;, and established &quot;Shannon Airport Authority plc&quot; and &quot;Cork Airport Authority plc&quot;. The three new authorities had power to formulate business plans for their respective airports, however they would not take charge of running the airports until a further date to be determined by the Minister for Transport, which by law could not be before 1 May 2005. this had yet to take place. Significant outstanding issues to be resolved include competitiveness and debit restructuring.

The company also retains its significant shareholdings in foreign airports such as Düsseldorf and Larnaca, through its wholly owned subsidiary ARI, Aer Rianta International.

The State Airports Act was heavily criticised by Noel Hanlon, the outgoing chairman of Aer Rianta, and by the company&#x27;s unions, who believed it a precursor to privatisation. No act to privatise Dublin Airport Authority or any of the airports has been passed however.

The Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed DAA with effect from November 2014.

In 2016, DAA paid a €18.3m dividend to the State, its first since 2009. In September 2017, Dalton Philips was appointed as its CEO. In May 2018, Basil Geoghegan was named chairman of the company.
In January 2023, Kenny Jacobs was appointed as its CEO.

In 2019, DAA saw record-breaking passenger numbers. The DAA was chosen for the Special Achievement in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) award ahead of 300,000 global candidates, using mapping software from GIS expert ESRI Ireland and working with the company to develop a new system to manage assets at the airport.

In 2020, Covid was “the most serious crisis that has ever faced the international aviation sector and our business,” according to then CEO Dalton Philips. By June 2020, the pandemic had already cost DAA €160m in lost revenue, with passengers decreased by 99%. The DAA implemented a series of public health measures to protect and enhance the health and safety of passengers and staff as a result of Covid-19. In October 2020, Dublin Airport anti-Covid-19 measures received accreditation from global industry body Airports Council International (ACI).

DAA returned to profit in 2023.

===Great Southern Hotels===

In 1990, the nine Great Southern Hotels were purchased from Córas Iompair Éireann, and sold again in 2006. Edward Holdings, a company controlled by Galway businessman Gerry Barrett bought the Killarney, Eyre Square and Corrib hotels, while Dublin developer Bernard McNamara has bought the Parknasilla hotel in County Kerry. A company controlled by Ronan McArdle, Frank McArdle, Alan McIntosh and the Walsh brothers has acquired the three airport hotels at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.

== Airports and operations ==

===Dublin Airport===
Dublin Airport is the state&#x27;s largest airport. It handled 31.5m passengers in 2018. It had record-breaking passenger numbers in 2019. Dublin Airport&#x27;s connectivity increased by 59% in the five years to the end of 2018, making it the second-fastest growing major airport in Europe in terms of connectivity. In October 2020, Dublin Airport anti-Covid-19 measures received accreditation from global industry body Airports Council International (ACI).

In 2022, Dublin Airport’s north runway came into operation . The runway cost €320 million, opening on time and on budget at no cost to the taxpayer. 

A court case arose in 2014 regarding a proposed contract to be let by daa for a range of airport facilities services at Dublin Airport. OCS One Complete Solution, the incumbent contractor, challenged the daa&#x27;s decision to award a new contract to Maybin Support Services Ltd., which led to a High Court hearing. Provisions under EU utilities procurement regulations, which include procurement in the transport sector, require an option for unsuccessful tenderers to be able to challenge an award decision if they have suitable grounds and provide for an automatic suspension of the new contract award process until the challenge has been resolved. This was the first occasion when the High Court ruled on a request for this automatic suspension to be lifted. The court ruled in favour of leaving the suspension in place.

===Cork Airport===
*Cork Airport is the state&#x27;s second largest airport.
*Handled 2.3 million passengers in 2017.

===Other operations===
Aer Rianta International (part of DAA) operates travel retail/duty free outlets in 10 countries, with stores in countries such as Canada, Cyprus, India and New Zealand. It also has outlets in several countries in the Middle East and in 2015 won a 10-year contract to operate duty-free stores at the new Midfield Terminal Building in Abu Dhabi International Airport.

In 2016, DAA International won the contract to manage the new Terminal 5 at King Khaled International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 

In 2022, DAA international won a multimillion euro contract to manage Jeddah Airport in Saudi Arabia for five years.

IN 2022, ANA Aeroportos de Portugal appointed Aer Rianta International as its partner to manage duty-free and duty-paid shops in eight locations. 

== Dublin Airport Delays ==
On 1 June 2022, then daa chief executive Dalton Philips was called to appear before the Oireachtas transport committee. following multiple days of prolonged queues, more than 1,000 passengers missing a flight in one day and providing no guarantee that such queues would not return was described by Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Seán Fleming as a &quot;reflection of bad management, full stop&quot;. The Taoiseach said the delays are &quot;unacceptable for passengers and their families.&quot;

In May 2021, Philips had defended the decision to lay off 2,000 of daa&#x27;s 7,750 staff, despite the State backstop in place at the time as necessary stating &quot;if you had that [bailout] mentality, it’s all over...we have to carry our own water.&quot; The decision to fire so many staff was criticised in June 2022 in Dáil Éireann, with deputies claiming that the resultant airport delays had made Ireland in to a &quot;laughing stock&quot;.

<text>A bullwhip is a single-tailed whip, usually made of braided leather or nylon, designed as a tool for working with livestock or for competition cracking.

Bullwhips are pastoral tools, traditionally used to control livestock in open country. A bullwhip&#x27;s length, flexibility, and tapered design allows it to be thrown in such a way that, toward the end of the throw, part of the whip exceeds the speed of sound—thereby creating a small sonic boom. The bullwhip was rarely, if ever, used to strike cattle, as this could inflict damage to the animal. Instead, the whip was cracked near the animal to startle and guide them, encouraging movement in the desired direction.

The cracking sound is of a sonic boom. This is most likely the first item used by humans to go faster than the speed of sound.

The bullwhip should not be confused with the stockwhip, an Australian whip also used to control livestock but having a somewhat different structure. 

== History ==
The origins of the bullwhip are also a matter for debate and, given the perishable nature of leather, are likely to remain so. Difficulties in tracing its development also arise from regional and national variations in nomenclature. There are claims that it was developed in South America where, like &quot;cow-whips&quot; during the slave trade, it was used as a weapon, or that it arrived there from Spain, but Roman mosaics and earthenware dating to around the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD show what appear to be tapered drop-lash whips, rather than the two-piece whips often associated with the Romans and other ancient cultures. Given that the same basic design appears in several primary sources, it seems likely that this is not a stylistic coincidence but a depiction of a design of whip in current use at the time the articles were made.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as rural economies became increasingly mechanized, demand for all types of whips diminished. By the middle of the 20th century, bullwhip making was a dying craft, with only a few craftsmen left making good quality whips.

In the later half of the 20th century, attempts to preserve traditional crafts, along with a resurgence of interest in Western performance arts and the release of films featuring whips, such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, led to an increased interest in whip cracking as a hobby and performance art, as well as a competitive sport. Whip cracking competitions focus on the completion of complex multiple cracking routines and precise target work; although other whips are also used in such competitions.

Whereas, in times past, the bullwhip was designed for one basic, main purpose, modern whip makers design their whips for different specific purposes and to suit different throwing styles. Regardless of their intended end use, all bullwhips have certain common features.

== Description ==
A bullwhip consists of a handle section, a &quot;thong&quot;, a &quot;fall&quot;, and a &quot;cracker&quot;. A wrist loop may also be present, although its chief purpose is for hanging one&#x27;s whip on a hook. Aesthetically, it finishes the handle.

The main portion of the bullwhip&#x27;s length is made up of a braided body or &quot;thong&quot;. Made of many strips of leather or nylon, the number of braids or plaits is an important factor in the construction of the whip. Often the thong is multi-layered, having one or more &quot;bellies&quot; in the center. Quality whips have at least two bellies, made of braided leather like the surface of the whip, although with fewer plaits. Lower-quality whips may have no bellies at all, and are sometimes stuffed with materials such as newspaper or electrical tape, which will break down with use. Unlike in the Australian stock whip, the thong connects in line with the handle (rather than with a joint), or sometimes completely covers the handle.

The &quot;handle&quot; is usually short, being between long. While some whips have an exposed wooden grip, others have an intricately braided leather- or nylon-covered handle. Leather-covered handles usually contain a butt foundation, which is held in the palm of the hand when cracking, and can have a wrist loop, used for hanging the whip at the end of the day, not for putting around the wrist during use. Nylon handles usually have a Turk&#x27;s knot at the end and may have a loop; they also might have a pattern thanks to nylon being available in many colors. Some handles swivel, making it easier to do certain types of unsophisticated cracks but making it harder to do others, or to use the whip for any type of accurate targeting. The Australians introduced a longer-handled bullwhip to the US, where the bullwhips traditionally had shorter handles. The longer-handled whip, with a handle of , functions like a cross between a stockwhip and a bullwhip, and is referred to as a &quot;Target Whip.&quot;

Bullwhips are usually measured from the butt of the handle to the end of the plaiting of the thong. The thong typically terminates at a fall hitch—a series of half hitches that neatly tie the (replaceable) fall (or tail) to the whip. Bullwhips range in length from to very long bullwhips of , with some examples being even longer.

A &quot;fall&quot; is a single piece of leather or nylon cord between in length. It was traditionally made to be replaceable due to the extreme stresses the very end of the whip was subjected to as it was &quot;cracked&quot;. In lesser-quality whips, the fall can also be a continuation of one of the strands used in plaiting the overlay, or it can be an extension of the core of the whip, with the strands from the overlay tied off, and the core continuing on as the fall. But these types of falls aren&#x27;t replaceable, and thus are seen as impractical.
Tied to the end of the flexible fall is an even more flexible piece called the &quot;cracker&quot;, &quot;popper&quot; or &quot;cat-tail&quot;. Some sources state that the cracker is the portion of the whip that makes the loud noise known as the sonic boom. A whip will create a cracking sound without a cracker, but the sound will be much less loud. It has been suggested that the frayed end of the cracker may cause more fibers to move at supersonic speeds, increasing the likelihood of a sonic boom. It has also been found that when a whip is cracked, the cracker moves in an arc at the end of the whip. Instead of moving smoothly as the end of the whip up to the cracker does, the cracker suddenly flips around the end of the whip, amplifying the acceleration experienced there. This flipping motion is necessary for a sonic boom to be produced by the cracker. Cracking a whip causes wear to the cracker, and well-used whips frequently require new crackers. Crackers can be made of horsehair, twine, string, nylon, polypropylene, silk, polyester or any number of materials. There are several methods of tying the cracker to the fall, usually using a lark&#x27;s head knot as the basis, since it tightens on itself when the whip is cracked, reducing the chance the cracker will slip from the fall and fly off.

Bullwhips come in many different weights, materials, and designs. Some light whips use shot-loading or lead weights for balance. While usually made of strips of leather, nylon whips (often using paracord) have become popular; they were initially developed for use in the wetlands of Florida, where leather is difficult to maintain (hence the name &quot;Florida Cow Whip&quot;), but have recently gained in popularity because they are less expensive than leather. Formerly in America, regular cowhide, rawhide and oxhide leathers were most commonly used for the construction of bullwhips because they were readily available. They tend to be quite thick and sturdy and are good for harsh conditions. Some whip-crackers doing target work prefer a whip made of kangaroo skin and kangaroo hide is preferred by whip makers because it is many times stronger than cow hide and can be cut into fine, strong laces allowing for more intricate braiding patterns that could previously only be achieved with rawhide, which is much harder to work with.

<text>The square foot (; abbreviated sq ft, sf, or ft2; also denoted by &#x27;2 and ⏍) is an imperial unit and U.S. customary unit (non-SI, non-metric) of area, used mainly in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Ghana, Liberia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Hong Kong. It is defined as the area of a square with sides of 1 foot.

Although the pluralization is regular in the noun form, when used as an adjective, the singular is preferred. So, an apartment measuring 700 square feet could be described as a 700 square-foot apartment. This corresponds to common linguistic usage of &quot;foot.&quot;

The square foot unit is commonly used in real estate. Dimensions are generally taken with a laser device, the latest in a long line of tools used to gauge the size of apartments or other spaces. Real estate agents often measure straight corner-to-corner, then deduct non-heated spaces, and add heated spaces whose footprints exceed the end-to-end measurement.

<text>The Visalia Rawhide are a Minor League Baseball team of the California League and the Single-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. They are located in Visalia, California, and have played their home games at Valley Strong Ballpark since their inception in 1946.

The team has had nine names, most of which reflected its changing major-league affiliates, most recently the Minnesota Twins, Colorado Rockies, Oakland A&#x27;s, Tampa Bay Rays, and Diamondbacks. They took the name Rawhide in 2009.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Rawhide were organized into the Low-A West at the Low-A classification. In 2022, the Low-A West became known as the California League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization, and was reclassified as a Single-A circuit.

== Casey Jones/Casey at the Bat ==
Once per season, the team wears old-fashioned uniforms recalling Mighty Casey, the main folklore hero of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; and the &quot;Mudville Nine&quot;, based on the Stockton Ports in Stockton.

Visalia is one of the four oldest cities of the Cal League, along with San Jose (the San Jose Giants/Bees); and Modesto (the Modesto Nuts/A&#x27;s).

==Mascot==
The Visalia Rawhide mascot is a Holstein Bull named Tipper, introduced on October 15, 2008. Tipper represents the tens of thousands of Holsteins in Tulare County, the top dairy-producing area in the country. Tipper&#x27;s home is a ballpark barn – a 40&#x27; x 20&#x27; red barn which is part of the outfield fence – doubles carom off the side of the barn, and home runs land on the roof, leading to a new twist on the old baseball adage &quot;couldn&#x27;t hit the broad side of the barn&quot; which now represents weak hitters instead of wild pitchers. The traditional red barn was built as a &quot;community barn raising&quot; to raise awareness for Habitat for Humanity and stands as an icon for the agricultural heritage of the valley.

==Pop culture==
As a minor league affiliate of the Oakland A&#x27;s at the time, the Visalia Oaks were prominently mentioned in the Michael Lewis Book &#x27;Moneyball&#x27;, and also featured a few times during the 2011 movie &quot;Moneyball&quot; (which took place in 2002). In one scene, Billy Beane is driving to see the Visalia Oaks during the A&#x27;s winning streak, and another shows Billy watching video of Visalia Oaks catcher Jeremy Brown tripping and then diving back to first on a ball that turned out to be a home run.

In the 1988 film &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, Visalia was mentioned as a potential managing job for aging catcher Crash Davis, played by Kevin Costner.

In the 1994 film &quot;Little Big League&quot;, a Visalia Oaks pennant can be seen hanging on the wall in the main character’s bedroom.

<text>Oscar Mayer is an American meat and cold cut producer known for its hot dogs, bologna, bacon, ham, and Lunchables products. The company is a subsidiary of the Kraft Heinz Company and based in Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
===Early years===
German immigrant Oscar F. Mayer (1859–1955), born in Kösingen, Germany, began working at a meat market in Detroit, Michigan, and later in Chicago, Illinois. In 1883, Mayer and his brother Gottfried leased the Kolling Meat Market on the near-northside of Chicago. The Mayer brothers sold bratwurst, liverwurst, and weißwurst, which were popular in the predominantly German neighborhoods around their Chicago meat market.

As the meat market&#x27;s popularity grew, it expanded its storefront and participated in sponsoring local events including the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. By 1900, the company had 43 employees and Chicago-wide delivery service. In 1904, Oscar Mayer began branding its meats to capitalize on their popularity, beginning an industry-wide trend. Early company specialties were &quot;Old World&quot; sausages and Westphalian hams, soon followed by bacon and wieners. In 1906, Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. volunteered to join the newly created federal meat inspection program. In 1919, the company made its first major expansion, with the purchase of a processing plant in Madison, Wisconsin. The plant was a profitable, efficient operation, and in 1957 Madison became the corporate headquarters.

===Kraft ownership===
For nearly a century, Oscar Mayer remained an independent company owned primarily by descendants of the Mayer brothers who started it. In 1981, Oscar Mayer stockholders elected to sell the company to General Foods. Four years later, Philip Morris acquired General Foods, and in 1989 merged General Foods with the newly acquired Kraft Foods transforming it into Kraft General foods. Shares of Kraft Foods were first offered to the public via an initial public offering in 2001. Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) spun-off remaining shares of Kraft Foods to Altria shareholders in 2007.

On November 4, 2015, owner Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Oscar Mayer headquarters and the company&#x27;s U.S. meats business from Madison back to Chicago. The company also announced plans to consolidate its production facilities during the two following years, resulting in the shutdown of seven North American manufacturing facilities: Fullerton, California, San Leandro, California, Federalsburg, Maryland, St. Marys, Ontario, Campbell, New York, Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, and Madison.

In August 2017,&quot; Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported that the company planned to spend $10 million to reinvent the hot dog for a more health-conscious consumer.

==Advertisements==
Oscar Mayer had several advertisements on TV involving young children, including the Oscar Mayer Wiener ad in 1963. The commercial shows a young girl leading a group of children, singing about what they would get if they &quot;were an Oscar Mayer wiener&quot;. It was written by Richard D. Trentlage.

A 1973 TV commercial featured four-year-old Andy Lambros holding a fishing rod and sandwich while singing, &quot;My bologna has a first name, it&#x27;s &#x27;O-S-C-A-R&#x27;...&quot;. It became one of the longest-running TV commercials in the country.

Oscar Mayer is known for its Wienermobile, which has toured the United States for over 80 years. The first Wienermobile was created in 1936. On May 14, 2023, it was announced that the Wienermobile would be renamed the Frankmobile; four months later, this unpopular name change was reversed.

In 2019, Oscar Mayer started sponsoring Ryan Newman in the NASCAR cup series in the number 6 Roush Fenway Racing car. It later announced a two-year extension to the agreement.

Kraft that oversees the current brand along with Heinz, has begun promoting the next generation of Heinz Oscar Mayer Mascots, with the newest named Blue. Blue is from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The mascot is set to appear on a possible tour with the Weiner mobile this summer.

<text>A fleet of brandmobiles shaped like a hot dog on a bun, called &quot;Wienermobiles&quot;, are used to promote and advertise Oscar Mayer products in the United States. The first Wienermobile was created by Oscar Mayer&#x27;s nephew, Carl G. Mayer, in 1936. For a brief time in 2023, it was renamed the &quot;Frankmobile&quot; but due to popular demand, it was changed back to &quot;Wienermobile.&quot;

==History==
The Oscar Mayer Wienermobile has evolved from Carl Mayer&#x27;s original 1936 vehicle to the vehicles seen on the road today. Although that first Wienermobile was scrapped for metal in the 1940s to aid the US Army during World War II, Oscar Mayer and the Gerstenslager Company created several new vehicles using a Dodge chassis or a Willys Jeep chassis in the 1950s. The 1952 model is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. These Wienermobiles were piloted by &quot;Little Oscar&quot; (portrayed by George Molchan) who would visit stores, schools, orphanages, and children&#x27;s hospitals and participate in parades and festivals. Noted industrial designer Brooks Stevens is also credited with a &quot;new look&quot; 1950s design, taking advantages of the possibilities of modern molded fiberglass construction &quot;to put the wiener in the bun&quot; in 1958. 

In 1969, new Wienermobiles were built on a Chevrolet motor home chassis and featured Ford Thunderbird taillights. The 1969 vehicle was the first Wienermobile to travel outside the United States.

In 1976, Plastic Products, Inc., built a fiberglass and styrofoam model, again on a Chevrolet motor home chassis.

In 1988, Oscar Mayer had a fleet of six Wienermobiles using converted Chevrolet van chassis.
In 1995, a new version increased the size of the Wienermobile to a length of and a height of . This version also included the upgraded large parallelogram windows which could now open, as designed by Sheldon Theis.

In 2004, the Wienermobile included a voice-activated GPS navigation device, an audio center with a wireless microphone, a horn that plays the Wiener Jingle (in 21 different genres from Cajun to Rap to Bossa Nova), according to American Eats, and sports fourth generation Pontiac Firebird taillights.

Following mechanical problems with the Isuzu Elf, Oscar Mayer decided to adopt a larger chassis to accommodate an increase in the size of the signature wiener running through the middle. While the Wienermobile was not as long as the 1995 version, it was considerably wider and taller. Craftsmen Industries went through numerous overhauls of the truck including a flipped axle and a leveling kit. This version held a record for numerous suspension problems, most leading to the chassis not being able to hold the large weight of the Oscar Mayer Wiener.

In 2004, Oscar Mayer announced a contest whereby customers could win the right to use the Wienermobile for a day. Within a month, the contest had generated over 15,000 entries.

In June 2017, the company introduced several new hot-dog-themed vehicles, including the WienerCycle, WienerRover, and WienerDrone.

In May 2023, Oscar Mayer announced that it was renaming the Wienermobile to the Frankmobile, to promote a new recipe for its all-beef franks. It was suggested that the name change would not be permanent. The name was changed back in September 2023.

==Wienermobile drivers==
Six Wienermobiles operate throughout the United States.

The driver of a Wienermobile is called The Hotdogger. The Hotdogger job is to &quot;meat&quot; and greet people around the country. The duties of a Hotdogger include: &quot;...sharing photos and videos on social media, answering questions about the brand and the vehicle (the most frequently asked question is if there&#x27;s a bathroom in the back, to which they respond: &#x27;No, it&#x27;s not a Weenie-bago&#x27;), and distributing swag.&quot;

Only college seniors who are about to graduate are eligible to be Hotdoggers. Applicants should be getting their BA or BS, preferably in public relations, journalism, communications, advertising, or marketing. A Hotdogger&#x27;s assignment is for only one year. Recruiting for each year&#x27;s new Hotdogger cadre involves current Hotdoggers and Oscar Mayer recruiters visiting college campuses across the country. In 2018, 7,000 people applied to be Hotdoggers. As each Wienermobile carries two Hotdoggers, only 12 Hotdoggers are selected each year. Notable Hotdoggers include former US House Speaker Paul Ryan.

==Models==
Toys and scale replicas of the Wienermobile have been made over the years, with Hot Wheels issuing die-cast versions of the vehicle.

==Notable incidents==

In June 2007, a Wienermobile with the Wisconsin license plate of YUMMY made headlines after being stopped by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer for having an allegedly stolen license plate. Officer K. Lankow had observed the Wienermobile slowing traffic and checked the license plate to determine if the vehicle was street legal. The license plate came back as being stolen out of Columbia, Missouri, so the officer stopped the Wienermobile and detained the driver. Oscar Mayer had not notified police that they had obtained a duplicate replacement plate after the previous one was stolen, and that it should be considered stolen only if not on a Wienermobile. The Wienermobile was released soon after the error was discovered.

On July 17, 2009, a Wienermobile on a cul-de-sac in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, was attempting to turn around in a residential driveway. The driver, thinking the vehicle was in reverse, accelerated forward, lodging the Wienermobile under a house and destroying the house&#x27;s deck.

On January 26, 2020, a Wienermobile was pulled over by a Waukesha, Wisconsin, sheriff&#x27;s deputy for violating the Move Over Law, which requires motorists to switch lanes to pass an emergency vehicle with its warning lights on. The driver was issued a warning.

In February 2023, during the Super Bowl LVII weekend, an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile in Las Vegas had its catalytic converter stolen. 

In July 2024, a Wienermobile on I-294 near Chicago collided with a passenger sedan and flipped onto its side. No injuries were reported.

<text>Reykholt () is a village in Iceland. It sits in the valley of the river Reykjadalsá, called Reykholtsdalur, and is part of Borgarfjörður, Western Region.

Reykholt was at one time one of the intellectual centers of the island and had for many years one of the most important schools of the country. The poet and politician Snorri Sturluson lived in Reykholt during the Middle Ages. Sturluson&#x27;s records of the Old Norse language and mythology of medieval Iceland are invaluable to modern scholars. Remains of his farm and a bathroom with hot pot and a tunnel between the bath and the house can still be visited. The Snorrastofa Cultural / Research Centre was established in Reykholt on September 6, 1988, with opening ceremonies attended by Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, President of Iceland and King Olav V of Norway.
Today, the village has 60 inhabitants, a school centre and a library concentrating on the works of Snorri Sturluson. A statue of Snorri by Gustav Vigeland can be found here. Archeologists are still working here and finding medieval remains. In the vicinity, Japanese scientists are doing research on the aurora borealis (the northern lights).

About 20 km from Reykholt, there are the lava waterfalls Hraunfossar. It is also possible to go from there to the caves &quot;Surtshellir&quot; in the lava field &quot;Hallmundarhraun&quot; (about 35 km). On the way to Borgarnes, people pass by the hot springs of &quot;Deildartunguhver&quot;. They exceed all the other hot springs of the country in their output of hot water: 180 litres/second at 97 °C.

<text>The Religious Science movement, or Science of Mind, was established in 1926 by Ernest Holmes and is a spiritual, philosophical and metaphysical religious movement within the New Thought movement. In general, the term &quot;Science of Mind&quot; applies to the teachings, while the term &quot;Religious Science&quot; applies to the organizations. However, adherents often use the terms interchangeably.

The movement was established with the 1926 publication of &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;, in which Holmes stated &quot;Religious Science is a correlation of laws of science, opinions of philosophy, and revelations of religion applied to human needs and the aspirations of man.&quot; He also stated that Religious Science/Science of Mind (RS/SOM) is not based on any &quot;authority&quot; of established beliefs, but rather on &quot;what it can accomplish&quot; for the people who practice it. Today the International Centers for Spiritual Living, the United Centers for Spiritual Living (which combined into the Centers for Spiritual Living in 2011) and Global Religious Science Ministries are the main denominations promoting Religious Science.

==History==
Ernest Holmes did not originally intend for RS/SOM to be a &quot;church&quot;, but rather a teaching institution. In that spirit, many member &quot;churches&quot; have traditionally referred to themselves as &quot;centers&quot;. The mental healing work of Phineas Quimby was a source of inspiration to much of the New Thought movement, including RS/SOM. Ernest Holmes was especially strongly influenced by Emma Curtis Hopkins, a former student of Christian Science, especially her &quot;Scientific Christian Mental Practice&quot;, a direct precursor to Holmes&#x27; &quot;Spiritual Mind Treatment&quot;, and by the writings of Judge Thomas Troward and Ralph Waldo Emerson, as he developed his own synthesis, which became known as Religious Science or Science of Mind.

In 1926 Holmes published &quot;The Science of Mind&quot;, which references the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Bible and Buddha. Holmes established in 1927 the Institute for Religious Science and School of Philosophy, in Los Angeles. This organization would later become the Church of Religious Science. Holmes had previously studied another New Thought teaching, Divine Science, and he was an ordained Divine Science Minister. He saw humans as being &quot;open at the top&quot;—that is, open to the evolutionary improvement of consciousness in all areas of life. The concepts of &quot;Open at the Top&quot; and &quot;New Thought&quot; have inspired RS/SOM organizations and their teachings to evolve over the years. As stated in the book &quot;New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality&quot;, &quot;New Thought still is evolving; it may yet be the point at which religion, philosophy, and science come together as the most effective combination to move the world to greater peace, plenty, health, and harmony. Many believe it might be the quintessential spirituality for the next millennium.&quot;

The ideas put forth by Holmes attracted famous celebrities of his time including Cecil B. DeMille, Peggy Lee, and Cary Grant. For erstwhile radio luminary Les Mitchel, this attraction proved sufficient to warrant a complete career overhaul, circa 1961, as the longtime &quot;Skippy Hollywood Theatre&quot; mastermind founded and/or helped to found Religious Science churches in Oklahoma City, Albuquerque and Cleveland before settling in Sacramento, where he served as that church&#x27;s minister from 1971 until his death in 1975.

== Teaching and practice ==

The RS/SOM teaching generally incorporates idealistic and panentheistic philosophies. RS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as Spirit, Christ Consciousness, or God. It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities), its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence. Ernest Holmes said, &quot;God is not ... a person, but a Universal Presence ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness.&quot;

The introduction to &quot;The Science of Mind&quot; text describes &quot;The Thing Itself&quot; (God or Infinite Intelligence), &quot;The Way It Works&quot;, &quot;What It Does&quot; and &quot;How to Use It&quot;. Although Holmes was criticized for not focusing much on love, he did say that &quot;Love rules through Law.&quot; (i.e., the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and &quot;Love points the way and Law makes the way possible.&quot; The &quot;Law of Cause and Effect&quot; simply states that every action has a consequence—creative, destructive, or neutral. It can be described as Jesus Christ stated, &quot;You reap what you sow&quot; and &quot;The bread you cast upon the water, comes back to you&quot;. The Law of Attraction is one aspect of that Law. It differs from the Hindu definition of karma in that it is not related to reincarnation and that it happens in this life. Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM.

RS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called Spiritual Mind Treatment (Treatment), or Affirmative Prayer. Spiritual Mind Treatment is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in the mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating. Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Declaration, Thanksgiving, and Release. Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental meditation techniques.

== Organizations ==

There are four major organizations for Religious Science: Centers for Spiritual Living, the Agape International Spiritual Center(s), the Affiliated New Thought Network, and the Global Religious Science Ministries. Centers for Spiritual Living is the largest organization teaching Religious Science (Science of Mind) and has over 400 communities around the world. Its organization also continues to publish the works of Ernest Holmes as well as the monthly magazine, &quot;Science of Mind&quot;.

<doc id="699263" wikidata="Q3951793" url="?curid=699263" title="John Robinson (bishop of London)">
<text>John Robinson (7 November 1650 – 11 April 1723) was an English diplomat and prelate. He became the Bishop of London and Dean of Windsor, succeeding to Henry Compton.

==Early life==
Robinson was born at Cleasby, North Yorkshire, near Darlington, a son of John Robinson (died 1651) a cooper by trade and Elizabeth Potter. Educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, he became a fellow of Oriel College, and in about 1680 he became chaplain to the British embassy to Stockholm. He remained in Sweden for nearly thirty years. During the absence of the minister, Philip Warwick, Robinson acted as resident and as envoy extraordinary, and he was thus in Sweden during a very interesting and important period, and was performing diplomatic duties at a time when the affairs of northern Europe were attracting an unusual amount of attention.

Among his adventures, not the least noteworthy was his journey to Narva with Charles XII in 1700.

==Career==

In 1709, Robinson returned to England, and was appointed Dean of Windsor and of Wolverhampton; in 1710 he was elected bishop of Bristol, and among other ecclesiastical positions he held that of Dean of the Chapel Royal. In August 1711 he became Lord Privy Seal, this being, says Lord Stanhope, &quot;the last time that a bishop has been called upon to fill a political office.&quot; Echoing his Scandinavian connections, the motto on his coat of arms is written in runic characters.

In 1712, the bishop represented Great Britain at the important congress of Utrecht, and as first plenipotentiary, he signed the treaty of Utrecht in April 1713 that ended the War of the Spanish Succession. Just after his return to England he was chosen Bishop of London in succession to Henry Compton.

In 1718, he fostered a plan for the union of the English and Swedish churches, supported by Count Gyllenberg, Swedish Ambassador to London. The plan fell through because of the opposition of most Swedish bishops, although Svedberg of Skara and Gezelius, Bishop of Turku (Finland) were in favour. The reason for the opposition was that the Church of England was too Calvinist for them.

He died at Hampstead, having been a great benefactor to Oriel College, and is buried at All Saints Church, Fulham, London.

He married twice but had no issue by either marriage. His first wife was Mary Langton, daughter of William Langton. His second wife was Emma Cornwallis, widow of Thomas Cornwallis of Abermarlais and daughter of Sir Job Charlton, 1st Baronet and his second wife Letitia. Emma outlived him by many years, and died in 1748.

==Writings==
Robinson wrote an &quot;Account of Sweden together with an Extract of the History of that Kingdom. By a person of note who resided many years there&quot; (London, 1695). This was translated into French (Amsterdam, 1712), and in 1738 was published with Viscount Molesworth&#x27;s &quot;Account of Denmark&quot; in 1692. Some of his letters are among the Strafford papers in the British Museum.

==Other==
A member of the same family was Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson Robinson&#x27;s older brother, Christopher Robinson, immigrated to the Virginia Colony and became the patriarch of one of Virginia&#x27;s First Families. He is also related to Christopher Robinson and the Robinson political family of Upper Canada.

<text>The International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (Union internationale des sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques – UISPP) is a learned society, linked through the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences to UNESCO, and concerned with the study of prehistory and protohistory. In the words of its constitution:

:&quot;The UISPP is committed to promote prehistoric and protohistoric studies by the organisation of world congresses, through the creation of scientific commissions dedicated to specific themes, by supporting excavations of international significance, scholarly publications of international scope, conferences or any other learned meeting&quot;.

The UISPP, as an international association of scholars, is founded on the principle of the universality of science. It firmly upholds academic freedom, recognizing that the study of humanity is relevant to all contemporary societies. In this spirit, the UISPP staunchly opposes any form of discrimination, whether based on race, creed, philosophical or ideological beliefs, ethnic or geographical background, nationality, gender, language, or any other criteria. Such discrimination, rooted in intolerance, inherently contradicts the scientific approach.

Furthermore, the UISPP rejects attempts to fictionally rewrite history or engage in negationism. As a non-governmental organization, it welcomes all bona fide scholars to participate in its scientific activities, regardless of their background or affiliations. This inclusive approach reflects the UISPP&#x27;s commitment to fostering a diverse and open academic community dedicated to the advancement of knowledge about human prehistory and protohistory.

== History ==
The origins of the UISPP lie in an 1865 meeting of the &quot;Società italiana di scienze naturali&quot; (Italian Society of Natural Science) that led to the creation of the &quot;Congrès paléoethnologique international&quot; (CPI – International Palaeoethnological Congress). The first meeting of the CPI was held in Neuchâtel in 1866. The following year, in Paris, the name was changed to &quot;Congrès international d&#x27;anthropologie et d&#x27;archéologie préhistoriques&quot; (CIAAP – International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology).

A permanent council of the CIAAP was founded in 1880, and regular congresses continued to be held until the outbreak of World War I disrupted the regular scholarly meetings, causing a hiatus in international academic collaboration and exchange. In the aftermath of the war, efforts to revive the tradition of regular congresses were spearheaded by the &quot;Institut international d&#x27;anthropologie&quot; (IIA – International Institute of Anthropology). However, this organization&#x27;s structure and focus proved inadequate for the evolving needs of prehistoric and protohistoric research. The &quot;Institut&#x27;s&quot; limited international perspective and the secondary role it assigned to the fields of prehistory and protohistory ultimately led to calls for the establishment of a more specialized body that would more closely continue the tradition of the CIAAP. In response to these calls, the &quot;Congrès international des Sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques&quot; (CISPP – International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences) was formed in 1931, providing a dedicated platform for scholars active in prehistoric and protohistoric studies. This new organization aimed to foster international collaboration and advance research in these specific fields, addressing the gaps left by its predecessor. The creation of CISPP marked a significant step towards a more focused and globally-oriented approach to prehistoric and protohistoric sciences in the interwar period. Congresses were held in London in 1932 and in Oslo in 1936.

However, the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II significantly impacted the activities of the CISPP, and the third congress originally planned for 1940 in Budapest had to be cancelled. No major congresses were held between 1936 and 1950, when a concerted effort by scholars from across Europe finally reestablished the tradition of regular international congresses for the prehistoric and protohistoric sciences, with the first post-war congress held in Zurich in 1950. In 1955, the permanent council decided to affiliate the CISPP with a member organisation of UNESCO, the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences. This required a change of name, and in 1956 the CISPP became the &quot;Union internationale des sciences préhistoriques et protohistoriques&quot; (UISPP – International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences). UISPP congresses subsequently emerged as a vital forum for scientific exchange, bridging the divide between scholars from both sides of the Iron Curtain, despite the tensions of the Cold War. This role as a conduit for east–west dialogue was made possible by adhering to the principle of intellectual neutrality, which explicitly does not regard participants as representatives of any state or government. This approach proved key to fostering an environment of open academic discourse, transcending political boundaries and ideological differences. In 2019, UISPP joined the International Union of Academies (UAI – &quot;Union académique internationale&quot;).

== Structure ==
The structure of the UISPP has changed several times since its foundation, most recently in 2011, when the permanent council was abolished and individual and institutional memberships were introduced, making the organisation more democratic and transforming it into a fully representative body. Membership in the UISPP is open to all bona fide scholars. However, participation in its scientific commissions typically requires researchers to hold a PhD or be pursuing doctoral studies.

===General Assembly===
The general assembly comprises all registered UISPP members and convenes during each world congress. It approves motions proposed by the executive eommittee and elects the president, general secretary, and treasurer. Additionally, the general assembly decides on the establishment and dissolution of scientific commissions and makes other significant decisions within the UISPP framework, following consultation with the executive committee.

===Executive Committee===
The executive committee comprises the members of the board (president, general secretary, treasurer, vice-president(s)) and the presidents of all UISPP scientific commissions. Working in tandem with the board, its role is to uphold the principles of the UISPP and to oversee the activities of scientific commissions and the broader organization. The executive committee also monitors preparations for the triennial world congress, intervening in its organization only when faced with unexpected events or significant delays in the program proposed by the national organizing committee.

===Scientific Commissions===
The primary objective of the UISPP&#x27;s scientific commissions is to promote and coordinate international research in specific or specialized domains of prehistoric and protohistoric sciences between each world congress. The commissions are organized into six broader categories, although this list is not exhaustive.

* Historiography, methods and theories (history of archaeology, theories and methods in archaeology, scientific methods used in archaeology, e.g. from the natural sciences, applied sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, economic sciences, etc.),
* Culture, economy and environments (specific periods, diachronic themes, regional peculiarities),
* Archaeology of specific environments (deserts, mountains, volcanic areas, coastal areas, islands, etc.),
* Art and culture (all forms of artistic expression during prehistory and protohistory, including rock art and portable art),
* Technology and economy (invention and development of new technologies, raw material exploitation, including scientific techniques for the characterization of archaeomaterials and related processes),
* Archaeology and society (interaction between archaeology and current society, including strategies for heritage management and for scientific research, and addressing public engagement and societal implications of archaeological work).

The principal activities of a scientific commission are:

* The organization of scientific activities (colloquia, sessions, symposia, workshops) during each triennial UISPP world congress and at least once during the inter-congress period in between; the proceedings from these activities are published,
* Holding an annual general meeting of the commission, to plan a programme of activities for the next year and accept the minutes from the previous meeting,
* Producing and distributing an electronic newsletter, at least once a year, for the members of the commission.

== Congresses of the CISPP and UISPP ==
The frequency of UISPP congresses has evolved over time. Initially held every four years, they shifted to a five-year cycle in 1966 following UISPP&#x27;s affiliation with CIPSH, aligning with UNESCO guidelines. Since 2011, world congresses have been organized triennially, aiming to alternate between Europe and other continents.

The XIth UISPP World Congress was originally to be held in Southampton in 1986. However, the decision of the British organising committee, led by Peter Ucko, to exclude South African and Namibian archaeologists for political reasons, despite the declared opposition of many of them to apartheid and despite that exclusion constituting a violation of UISPP statutes, led the UISPP to withdraw its endorsement of the congress and postpone the XIth World Congress until 1987. The British organising committee went ahead with the congress planned for Southampton under the new name of the World Archaeological Congress (WAC). Whereas the majority of UISPP members rejected the split as a division of scholars and an opportunistic move, writing in 1987, Peter Ucko still described the UISPP as:

:a dinosaur which continues to seek to manipulate the world situation according to its archaic Western European preconceptions about what is relevant and important and what is not. It does so by devices such as the imposition of white rules and regulations which no one bothers to explain and by the manipulation of bureaucratic procedures.

Despite these initial divides, since 2005 relations between UISPP and WAC have resumed. The UISPP remains focused on prehistoric and protohistoric research, while WAC evolved to focus primarily on politically committed approaches and advocacy. The two organisations therefore have different scopes.

The XVIIIth World Congress of UISPP was held in Paris in June 2018. Its overarching theme was &quot;Adaptation and sustainability of prehistoric and protohistoric societies confronted with climate change&quot;1. This major congress formed part of the ongoing refoundation of Humanities led by the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences (which includes UISPP) and UNESCO. While all UISPP congresses have a general theme, they remain open to sessions on any other topic, which can be proposed during the general call for sessions.

The XIXth UISPP World Congress, originally planned for 2020 in Meknes, was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was ultimately held as a fully virtual event.

UISPP has also adopted a new format alongside its triennial world congresses: continental congresses focusing on the prehistory and protohistory of specific regions. The first congress in this new format will be a multi-venue event in Java, Indonesia in 2025, with the main theme &quot;Asian Prehistory Today: Bridging Science, Heritage and Development&quot;

==UISPP Prizes==
The UISPP awards several prizes to recognize excellence in archaeology and related sciences. These distinctions aim to acknowledge significant contributions to archaeological research in the fields of prehistory and protohistory, knowledge dissemination, and the promotion of prehistoric and protohistoric heritage. The awards are presented at each UISPP World Congress:

* Honorary Prize
* Award for major long-term archaeological excavation project
* Award for archaeological mediation (public outreach)
* Award for site monograph
* Award for synthesis book
* Award for doctoral thesis

== UISPP Publications ==
In addition to the publication of the proceedings from its congresses, UISPP since the 1950s has been overseeing the publication af a number of international monograph series aimed chiefly at the systematic publication of primary archaeological source material (&quot;Inventaria Archaeologica&quot;, &quot;Prähistorische Bronzefunde&quot;, &quot;Fiches typlogiques de l&#x27;industrie osseuse préhistorique&quot;) but also at specific themes of global interest (&quot;Human Societies facing Climate Change&quot;). Since 2018, UISPP has been publishing the peer-reviewed and open access &quot;Journal of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences / Revue de l&#x27;Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques&quot; (short: &quot;UISPP Journal&quot;).

<text>Gelnhausen () is a town, and the capital of the Main-Kinzig-Kreis, in Hesse, Germany. It is located approximately 40 kilometers east of Frankfurt am Main, between the Vogelsberg mountains and the Spessart range at the river Kinzig. It is one of the eleven towns (urban municipalities) in the district. Gelnhausen has around 22,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==
===Location===

According to the &quot;Institut Géographique National&quot; from 1 January 2007 until July 2013 the geographic centre of the European Union was located on a wheat field outside the town.

Gelnhausen is located on the German Fairy Tale Route, a tourist route.

==History==

Gelnhausen was founded by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1170, it is therefore nicknamed &quot;Barbarossastadt&quot;. The place was chosen because it was at the intersection of the Via Regia imperial road between Frankfurt and Leipzig and several other major trade routes. Frederick had three villages connected by streets and surrounded by a wall. At the same time, Gelnhausen received town privileges and a &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; was erected on an island of the Kinzig river. The emperor also granted trade privileges like the staple right which forced traveling merchants to offer their goods in the town for three days.

Hence Gelnhausen initially was a thriving trade town and head of a league of 16 towns of the Wetterau region. However prosperity came to an end already in 1326 when Emperor Louis IV gave the town in pawn to the counts of Hanau, redeemed shortly afterwards. In 1349 Count Günther von Schwarzburg received Gelnhausen from Emperor Charles IV for renouncing his claims as elected King of the Romans, in condominium with the counts of Hohnstein, who sold their share to Schwarzburg in 1431. Schwarzburg was acquired in 1435 by Elector Palatine Louis III and the Hanau, since raised to a county.

Repeated plundering in the Thirty Years&#x27; War as depicted by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen in his novel &quot;Simplicius Simplicissimus&quot; made it nearly uninhabitable. In 1736, the extinction of the comital line of Hanau meant the condominium share was inherited by the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, who acquired the Palatinate&#x27;s share ten years later.

The varying lords made continued attempts to challenge Gelnhausen&#x27;s imperial immediacy, it however formally remained a &quot;Reichsstadt&quot;. During the German Mediatisation of 1803 the city became a part of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, which was raised to an electorate and, after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, was annexed by Prussia. At this time Gelnhausen had completely recovered, and with the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; economic boom it became a centre of the German rubber industry.

==The Holocaust==
During the Nazi era, Gelnhausen was reported judenfrei on November 1, 1938, by propaganda newspaper &quot;Kinzigwacht&quot; after its synagogue was closed and remaining local Jews forced to leave the town.

From the 1930s Gelnhausen was a garrison town of the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and, after World War II, of the United States Army. The US Army closed Coleman Kaserne in 2007.

In 1996, the town hosted the 36th Hessentag state festival.

==Arts and culture==
===Attractions===

Sights include:

* Medieval town center with historic buildings like the &#x27; (ca. 1180), the &#x27; (1351/52). 
*The &quot;Kaiserpfalz Gelnhausen&quot;. The castle was erected 1160-80 at the time of Gelnhausen&#x27;s foundation southeast of the town on an island in the Kinzig river. The groundwork is stabilized by 12,000 logs, driven into the earth. Today it is the best preserved &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; from this era.
*The &quot;&quot;, the most recognizable landmark of Gelnhausen. It shows both Romanesque (like the six-storey west tower) and Gothic architecture (the octagonal crossing tower and the east towers) elements. The church was built from local bunter between 1170 and 1250 by Selbold Abbey, replacing a simple chapel from ca. 1100 of which some traces remain. In 1543, Gelnhausen turned Protestant and the church became the Protestant parish church.
*The Catholic church of . Its origins lie in the early 13th century; rich citizens of Gelnhausen planned to erect a church within the town, causing a conflict with the Selbold Abbey that owned the clerical patronage for Gelnhausen. This conflict was escalated up to Pope Gregory IX who decided in favour of the abbey. From the 13th to the 15th century the church was used for weddings, baptisms, and funerals. After the Reformation, the building became the property of the town. It subsequently fell into ruin and was sold in 1830 to a local merchant. After the demolition of the second tower, a cigar factory was built in it. In 1920, the Catholic community of Gelnhausen bought the church and partly restored it over an 18-year period. A complete restoration took place in 1982–3.

<doc id="699277" wikidata="Q5498552" url="?curid=699277" title="Frederick Philipse Robinson">
<text>Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson, GCB (September 1763 – 1 January 1852) was a soldier who fought for Britain during the American War of Independence. His father, Colonel Beverley Robinson, was a Virginian who moved to New York, marrying a wealthy heiress of the Philipse family with Dutch and Bohemian ancestry, Susanna Philipse. Frederick was born in the Hudson Highlands on the family estate in the Philipse Patent, today&#x27;s Putnam County, New York, in September 1763.

On the conclusion of peace he went to England. He subsequently took part in the War of 1812 with the United States and commanded a brigade at the unsuccessful Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1813 and 1814 he commanded a brigade under the Duke of Wellington in Spain. He was a provisional Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada in 1815. Afterwards he was governor of Tobago, and he became a general in 1841. In time he became the oldest soldier in the British service, and died at Brighton, England, at the age of 88.

== Ancestry ==
He was the fourth son of Colonel Beverley Robinson, son of John Robinson, President of the Council at Virginia, North America. The Robinsons were, in property and family, among the leading men in that province. John Robinson was nephew to Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of London, and went to America as secretary to government. He resided at Williamsburg and married Catherine Beverley, daughter of Robert Beverley, Esq., of Beverley, Yorkshire.

Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of London, was distinguished both as a statesman and a divine. He was ambassador to the court of Sweden during the years 1683 to 1708. In the year 1710 he was made Bishop of Bristol, in the following year Lord Privy Seal. In 1712 he was first plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Utrecht, and soon after his return was translated to the See of London. He lies buried in the churchyard at Fulham.

Colonel Beverley Robinson arrived in New York from Virginia in 1745 as captain of an independent company, raised before leaving for the purpose of defending the frontier against the Indians, which company was disbanded in 1748. He soon afterward married Susannah Philipse, daughter of Frederick Philipse, second Lord of Philipsburg Manor, with whom he obtained large pieces of property in New York as his wife&#x27;s share of the Philipse Patent. As all Philipses were Loyal to the Crown during the American Revolution, the Beverlys holdings were seized in 1779 by the Revolutionary government of the Province of New York and were never compensated for their loss. Colonel Robinson died at Bath in March 1792 leaving a numerous family.

== America ==
At the earliest commencement of the American war Colonel Beverley Robinson raised the Loyal American Regiment, which performed signal service to the royal cause until the peace in 1783. In this regiment young Frederick Philipse Robinson received an ensigncy in February 1777, and on 1 September 1778 he was appointed to the 17th Foot, which he joined in October following. In March, 1779, he commanded a company, in the absence of his captain, at the Battle of Horseneck, under General William Tryon. In July, 1779, being in garrison at the post of Stony Point on the Hudson River, the place was stormed at midnight by a strong force of the Americans under General Anthony Wayne, and after a sharp and close conflict of more than an hour, during which the young ensign was wounded in the shoulder by a musket ball, he found himself a prisoner of war. Whilst detained as such at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he was promoted to be Lieutenant in the 60th Foot on 1 September 1779, and transferred to the 38th Foot on 4 November 1781. Upon being released by order of General George Washington, said to have been a childhood friend of his father in Virginia, joined that regiment the end of November at Brooklyn, New York. The year 1783, which gave peace to Europe and America, destroyed the hopes of the American loyalists. They were involved in one general proscription, and obliged to abandon their property, which had been declared forfeited in 1779 for their attachment to the royal cause. The evacuation of New York took place in 1783—the 38th formed one of the six regiments which remained until the final embarkation, and arrived at Portsmouth January 1784. In spite of a provision in the Treaty of Paris ending the conflict requiring those whose property was attained by the Colonial government to be compensated for their losses none was ever forthcoming to the Robinsons or other heirs of the Philipse estates.

== West Indies ==
After serving in England and Ireland during the following nine years, Lieut. Robinson embarked with his regiment at Cork on 24 November 1793, forming part of Sir Charles Grey&#x27;s expedition to the West Indies. He was present at the capture of Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe, including the storming of Fleur-de-l&#x27;Épée, and the heights of Palmonte. He was promoted to a company, 3 July 1794, and commanded the Grenadiers until after the capture of Guadeloupe, when, his health having suffered severely from the climate, he returned to England on sick certificate.

==Bedford and London==
On 1 September 1794, Capt. Robinson was gazetted Major of the 127th Foot, and removed to the 32nd Foot 1 September 1795. Some time afterwards he was appointed Inspecting Field Officer at Bedford, received the rank of Lieut.-Colonel in the Army 1 January 1800, and the command of the London Recruiting District, in February 1809. He was actively employed in organising and drilling the Volunteers in the metropolis. In December 1803, the Bank of England Supplementary Volunteer Corp presented Lieut.-Colonel Robinson with a splendid piece of plate, &quot;as a testimony of their respect and esteem, and the high sense they entertain of his great attention in bringing them to their present state of discipline.&quot;

By 1807, the then Col. Robinson had commanded London Recruiting District, and the Pimlico battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Loyal Volunteers from about 1803. Robinson was posted to London from Bedford, c 1801. On Friday 8 May 1807, he addressed a meeting at Covent Garden, London where he introduced Col. Eliot to the meeting, as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Westminster in the 1807 United Kingdom general election.

== Peninsula ==
On 25 July 1810, he became Colonel in the army, and having from the commencement of the war in the Peninsula most earnestly desired permission to serve with the force under Wellington, his request was at length granted, and in September 1812, Colonel Robinson joined the army in Spain as a Brigadier-General. On 4 June 1813, he became a Major-General. No opportunity occurred of distinguishing himself until the action at Osona on 18 June 1813, on which occasion his conduct was especially noticed. On 21 June, the memorable battle of Vittoria took place, in which General Robinson commanded the brigade which carried the village of Gamarra-Mayor at the point of the bayonet under a heavy fire of artillery and musketry, repulsing the numerous desperate efforts of the enemy to recover it. Sir Thomas Graham (Lord Lynedoch), in his order thanking the column, states: 
:&quot;The attack of the village of Gamarra by Major-General Robinson&#x27;s brigade was justly admired by all who witnessed it. Too much praise cannot be given to Major-General Robinson and the troops of his brigade for their persevering defence of a post so gallantly won, against numerous artillery and great masses of infantry, the enemy employed to retake it, in repeated attacks.&quot;
On 21 July 1813, General Robinson took part in the first assault of St. Sebastian, and on 31 August he commanded the attacking column at the second and successful assault, and was severely wounded. On 7 October following, the Major-General was at the head of the leading column at the passage of the Bidassoa; on 9 November was at the attack of Secoa and the Heights of Cibour; on 10 December, at the battle of the Nive, was again severely wounded. He recovered to take part in the operations at the blockade of Bayonne and the repulse of the sortie on 14 April 1814, when he succeeded to the command of the fifth division.

== Canada, War of 1812 ==
In June 1814, the Duke of Wellington selected General Robinson to proceed in command of a brigade to North America, and he accordingly embarked at Bordeaux with battalions of the 27th, 39th, 76th, and 88th regiments, and arrived at Brandypots, 100 miles below Quebec, on 9 August 1814. In September he commanded two brigades intended to attack the works of Plattsburg during the War of 1812, but after having gallantly forced the passage of the Saranac, received orders from Sir George Prevost to retire. In November following, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and Provisional Governor of the Upper Provinces in Canada, which he held until June, 1816, when he returned to England.

==Tobago==
He afterwards became Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Tobago from 1816 to 1828, &quot;fulfilling the duties to the entire satisfaction of the home government and the inhabitants of the colony&quot; although from all appearances, a &quot;flat statement in which even his own defense exposes as being uncharacteristically flawed.

== Personal life ==
On 2 January 1815, General Robinson was nominated a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and he was advanced to be a Grand Cross in 1838. He attained the rank of Lieut.-General 27 May 1825, and that of General 23 November 1841; and was appointed to the command of the 39th regiment on 15 June 1840. Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson lived to become the oldest soldier in the British service, his first commission being of earlier date than those of the few general officers whose names preceded his in the Army List. For the last seven years he resided at Brighton, Sussex, in the possession of good health and in the exercise of all his mental faculties, enjoying the affectionate attendance of a beloved daughter and niece, and the society of an attached circle of friends, to whom be had endeared himself by his noble and amiable qualities. He died after a very few days illness on the first day of 1852, and on 7 January his honoured remains were consigned to their last resting-place in the churchyard of Hove, near Brighton.

Sir Frederick was twice married:

Firstly, early 1790s, to Grace Boles, daughter of Thomas Boles, Esq., of Charleville, who died in 1806, with issue including:
*Maria Susan Robinson (born 18 November 1793, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford)
*Frederick Philipse Robinson (born 20 January 1797, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter Bedford)
*Beverley George Robinson (born 31 January 1799, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford)
*Jane Robinson (born 28 January 1802, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford)

Secondly, in 1811, to Ann Fernyhough, of Stafford, who died at Tobago.

<doc id="699278" wikidata="Q3028690" url="?curid=699278" title="List of Chicago Blackhawks players">
<text>The Chicago Blackhawks are a professional ice hockey team based in Chicago, Illinois. They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The club was founded in 1926 as one of the league&#x27;s first American franchises, joining in the same year as the New York Rangers and the Detroit Red Wings (then known as the Detroit Cougars). Owing to the Blackhawks&#x27; long history, they are considered one of the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Original Six&quot; teams—a term reserved for the six teams that comprised the NHL from the 1942–43 season until the league expanded in 1967. As of October 9, 2020, 955 players have played at least one game for the franchise, either in the NHL regular season or in the playoffs.

The Blackhawks, known as the Black Hawks from their inception until 1986, have won the Stanley Cup six times in their 83-year history. Charlie Gardiner, the team&#x27;s goaltender for its first Stanley Cup win in 1934, became the first European-born captain—and still the only goaltender captain—to win the Stanley Cup. Johnny Gottselig became the second European-born captain to do so when the team won its second championship in 1938. Stan Mikita is the franchise leader in assists (926) and points (1467), and Bobby Hull is the leader in goals (604). Chris Chelios is the franchise leader in penalty minutes (1495). Goaltender Tony Esposito is the club&#x27;s all-time leader in wins (418) and shutouts (74).

The franchise has had 34 players selected as captains. Each NHL team may select a captain, who has the &quot;sole privilege of discussing with the referee any questions relating to interpretation of rules which may arise during the progress of a game&quot;. Captains are required to wear the letter &quot;C&quot; on their uniform for identification, which is in height. Dick Irvin was named the first captain in 1926. The current captain, Jonathan Toews, was the third-youngest captain in NHL history at the time of his selection.

==Notes==
* Save percentage did not become an official NHL statistic until the 1982–83 season. Therefore, goaltenders who played before 1982 do not have official save percentages.
* The seasons column lists the first year of the season of the player&#x27;s first game and the last year of the season of the player&#x27;s last game. For example, a player who played one game in the 2000–2001 NHL season would be listed as playing with the team from 2000 to 2001, regardless of what calendar year the game occurred within.
* Moe Roberts, an assistant trainer for the team at the time, played twenty minutes after a knee injury forced Harry Lumley out of a game.

<text>The Ausable River (), also known as AuSable River and originally written as &quot;Au Sable&quot;, runs in the U.S. state of New York, from the Adirondack Mountains and past the village of Lake Placid and Au Sable Forks to empty into Lake Champlain (at ). It has an East and West branch that join at Au Sable Forks. The river forms a partial boundary between Clinton County and Essex County. The Ausable River is known for its gorge, Ausable Chasm, located a few miles east of Keeseville.

The Ausable River is long and drains a watershed of .

It was originally named &quot;Au Sable&quot; (French for &quot;sandy&quot;) by Samuel de Champlain when he first explored the region in 1609 because of its extensive sandy delta.

==West Branch Ausable River==

The West Branch of the Ausable arises from the confluence of the MacIntyre, South Meadow and Marcy Brooks, east of Mount Jo near the Adirondak Loj; it then runs northeast to Au Sable Forks (), and is fed by Lake Placid and the Chubb River along the way. At high water-levels, the upper end provides demanding white-water paddling opportunities. Further along, it runs through High Falls Gorge at the Wilmington Notch, a gorge formed by a fault zone, with cliffs on one side and cliffs on the other.

==East Branch Ausable River==
The East Branch arises from Upper and Lower Ausable lakes in the Ausable Valley, which forms the south side of the Great Range. The first are especially scenic, and can be viewed from trails on either side maintained by the Adirondack Trail Improvement Society. The river is then met by the Cascade Brook which flows from the Cascade Lakes, beneath Cascade Mountain, on its way to Au Sable Forks.

<doc id="699288" wikidata="Q5238893" url="?curid=699288" title="David Ramsay (trader)">
<text>David Ramsay (c. 1740 – c. 1810) was a controversial figure born in Leven, Scotland, who served as a cabin boy in the British Royal Navy, participated in the siege of Louisbourg in 1758 and later acted as a courier, translator and fur and alcohol trader, in part of the lower Great Lakes region consisting of present-day southern Ontario, Canada, and western New York state.

Several conflicting images emerge of Ramsay regarding his conduct amongst the native people of the region while engaged as a trader. One cluster of accounts preserved in the 18th and 19th century oral tradition of Loyalist settlers in the area around Long Point, Ontario, draws mostly on stories told by the wife of local settler Frederick Mabee in the early 19th century and portray Ramsay as a quintessential &quot;pioneer hero&quot; figure who strikes out at local natives only in preservation of his life and property, against the onslaught of the local Ojibwa people who sought to harm him without cause.

Another perspective, derived from native oral accounts in the early 19th century by missionary Peter Jones, present a decidedly different version of Ramsay&#x27;s activities in Upper Canada. This latter version is also more in keeping with Ramsay&#x27;s own legal declaration on May 15, 1772, at Fort Niagara, after he surrendered himself to British colonial legal authorities.

In this account, Ramsay confessed that in March 1772, on the banks of Kettle Creek north of the present day community of Port Stanley, Ontario, &quot;in defense of his life&quot;, he had killed an Ojibwa man named Wandagan, as well as two women who were also present while other natives were absent from the camp. Ramsay also admitted that he had scalped all three adult individuals involved and also kidnapped two local children who were in the company of the natives, one aged twelve, removing them to the Long Point area.

The following month he claimed to have been approached by local Ojibwas in the vicinity of Long Point, and after lying to them regarding the origin of the children, who he claimed were &quot;English&quot;, was taken prisoner, tied up, and placed by the fire. Ramsay stated in his declaration that he then managed to release his bonds, and proceeded to kill four adult natives and a child before making an escape. In all cases Ramsay maintained that he had acted in defense of his life and property and that he had initially been accosted by the Ojibwa on Kettle Creek when he had refused them a share in his cache of trade alcohol.

British colonial Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the time, Sir William Johnson, who had read Ramsay&#x27;s declaration and conferred with local native informants, believed that Ramsay&#x27;s actions were not in self-defense, but rather constituted homicide and concluded that the murders and scalpings were &quot;inexcusable and the circumstances of his being able to do all this, is an evident proof that he was not in the danger he represents and that the Indians were too much in the liquor to execute any bad purpose.&quot; Ramsay&#x27;s actions, in particular his scalping of his victims which according to Ojibwa custom constituted an act of war, precipitated a crisis in relations between British colonial authorities and the regional native population. Johnson attributed the killings to the &quot;private act of a villain&quot;, not official British policy, and achieved an 
at least temporary resolution to the situation, by distributing a 
shipment of gifts to native leaders in the area. Johnson also ordered the recall of all regional traders to local military posts until further notice and called for a redistribution of British troops in the region in the face of potential open conflict. He further ordered the transfer of the prisoner Ramsay to Montreal for a criminal trial. Johnson stated that he believed that Ramsay deserved &quot;capital punishment&quot; for his actions, but believed that a fair trial was unobtainable under the circumstances and personally did not &quot;think that [Ramsay] will suffer, had he killed a hundred.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s prediction held true and despite Ramsay allegedly bragging about the killings while under guard in Montreal and indicating that he would repeat his actions upon release, received no punishment, at least partly due to the prosecution providing no native witnesses.

There is some evidence to suggest that Ramsay, later in life, modified his attitude toward native people and is known to have acted on their behalf in several matters pertaining to issues between them and the colonial government. Almost nothing is known about Ramsay in later life, apart from his possession of a large tract of land in Upper Canada and his ownership of a trading ship in the port of New York. Ramsay disappears from the historical record circa 1810.

==David Ramsay In local legend==
A number of regional legends, traceable to stories told by white settlers in the mid to late 19th century in southern Ontario, have arisen surrounding the figure of David Ramsay. In one such tale, Ramsay is presented as a fur-trader who manages to evade natives along the north shore of Lake Erie with a boat loaded with gold, which he purportedly buries in a ridge at Long Point, planning to dig it up when the natives were no longer a problem.

According to the tale, Ramsay died before retrieving it, forgot all about his cache, or most likely forgot exactly where it was buried. A deacon named John Troyer learned of the legend, and reputedly using divination, acquired knowledge of its exact location. Troyer purportedly invited an 11- or 12-year-old boy, Simpson McCall, to help him claim the treasure. McCall&#x27;s parents refused, fearing the Deacon&#x27;s reputation. In one version of the tale excerpted from the &quot;Niagara Falls Evening Review&quot; of October 19, 1922, Troyer and the boy, in this variant referred to as his &quot;son&quot;, go in quest of the treasure:

&quot;They went to Long Point, arriving just enough before dark to locate the spot where the treasure was. Then they waited until exactly midnight, and then started a procession, Deacon Troyer holding the open Bible before him, and his son following with a lighted candle, with spades, picks, etc. They dug down, and presently the pick struck metal. They got the pick under the lid of the box and pried it up. And then, at that moment a black shape rose up and assumed the form of a black dog, growing bigger and bigger, and they dropped the Bible and candle and rushed for the canoe, and never had any curiosity to return to the spot.&quot;

This failed reclaiming story was purportedly told by Troyer to McCall, and McCall to J. H. Coyne, who made it public in an address at an Ontario Historical Society meeting in Norfolk County. This meeting was reported a few days later in the &quot;Niagara Falls Evening Review&quot;.

<text>Auoindaon was the native chief of the Wyandot (Huron) at Quieunonascaranas, a settlement in Wendake near modern-day Midland, Ontario, Canada. He made alliances with and became quite fond of French priests serving as missionaries in the area, one of the most notable being Gabriel Sagard. Upon first encountering Sagard, the Huron community at Quieunonascaranas all came out to greet him. Quieunonascaranas was a village settled by the Huron community and led by chief Auoindaon, in 1623 the settlement consisted of about 300 households and almost 40 lodges.

Gabriel Sagard was a French missionary who travelled through New France (Canada) and became the first religious historian in Canada. He spent much time with the Huron and wrote in detail about their customs and beliefs. It was during this missionary work that Sagard met Auoindaon, who was a Huron chief at the time. Sagard&#x27;s writings including The Long Journey to the Country of the Hurons is some of the most detailed and complete accounts of older Huron civilizations and lifestyles.

Auoindaon and Sagard bonded well together and Auoindaon welcomed Sagard as a visitor. From Sagard&#x27;s own writing he claims that Auoindaon offered to stay the night with him because Auoindaon feared that Sagard would be harmed by Iroquois who had stormed through the village not too long before.

Sagard accompanied Auoindaon on an annual fishing trip, which was an important part of Huron culture at the time. Documentation of the event describes that fish nets were put out at night and pulled in with catches in the morning. The people attending the event slept in wigwam type structures and set the nets out nearby. A fish- preacher was also present who would talk out to the fish while reciting hymns in the effort to lead the fish to the nets that were set out. Various other rituals were also performed such as throwing tobacco into the fire while reciting hymns and incantations. The fish that were caught during this trip were used for a multitude of things. Many of the fish were boiled for oil, while some others were gutted and hung up to dry. This annual fishing trip was a time of great merryment and celebration for all the members attending.

== Saint-Marie among the Hurons ==
In 1623, Auoindaon gave permission to the missionaries to begin construction on a mission which came to be called Saint-Marie-au-pays-des Hurons or Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, and was to be built close by to Quieunonascaranas. The mission was established in 1639 and was the first non-Indian settlement in Ontario. It was considered to be one of the most important missionary settlements and served as the center for travel between missions for the Jesuits. It stayed as a settlement from 1639 to 1649. The close proximity between the Huron village and the mission caused tensions to rise over time. There were people living in Quieunonascaranas who embraced Christianity and the missions willingly, and people who wanted to continue with traditional beliefs. Many in the Huron community blamed the missionaries for disease outbreaks and for undermining the shamans.

Auoindaon became convinced that the Europeans were &quot;oki&quot;, influential spirits or forces, because the continuous rain storm that had been occurring stopped itself until just after the cabin was finished. Oki were spirits or deities that were particularly respected by the Huron. Although the term could refer to several subjects: such as good and bad spirits as well as revered prophets, deities, angels, or demons.

== Second contact with Jesuit Priests ==
It is notable that after 1630 there is no mention of Auoindaon and his position had been replaced by a man named Aenons. Although there is speculation on whether or not Auoindaon and Aenons are one and the same, there is no solid evidence to suggest that they were. In 1633 more Jesuit priests were planning on settling near the original settlement of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, although when they arrived the people of Quieunonascaranas made no move to greet them as they originally had in 1625, even though this was the first village to have a resident priest. It was around this time too that Quieunonascaranas began dwindling in political and social influence and over time Aenons moved the community over to the Toanche area.

== Huron Nation and first contact with Europeans ==
The Huron were a large community living in what is now Ontario, Canada. The community also went by the name Wendat or Wyandot. At the time of first contact with the Europeans, the Huron were strong as a community with over an estimated 25,000 people, but as more and more European settlers came over the numbers of people dwindled to about 9,000 in result of diseases that the Huron had no immunity to, such as smallpox and measles.

At one point, they had been allies with the Iroquois, but after a series of attacks the Huron were pushed from their homeland. This is how it was when the Huron first made contact with the Europeans, they were still enemies with the Iroquois. The Huron had strong trading, social and political relations with many tribes of the Ottawa Valley. These tribes include the Petun, Algonquin, Nipissing, Neutral and Odawa. The Huron community would move locations every decade or so after natural resources in the area had been exhausted such as crop soil and firewood. They also established a confederacy of their own along the northern coastal part of Lake Ontario. Trading was very important to the Huron and the trade relations they established meant that they had access to seashells, wampum, copper, and tobacco.

The Huron accepted and helped French missionaries so that they could establish good trade relations. The first French missionaries to arrive were the Recollects, who were who were French reformers of the Friars Minor. The Recollect missionaries arrived around 1615. Within ten years however, these missionaries would be replaced by Jesuits in 1625. The Jesuits were the people who got permission from Auoindaon to commission and begin building Sainte-Marie among the Hurons nearby the Huron village of Quieunonascaranas.

<doc id="699294" wikidata="Q332430" url="?curid=699294" title="Absolute geometry">
<text>Absolute geometry is a geometry based on an axiom system for Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate or any of its alternatives. Traditionally, this has meant using only the first four of Euclid&#x27;s postulates. The term was introduced by János Bolyai in 1832. It is sometimes referred to as neutral geometry, as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate. The first four of Euclid&#x27;s postulates are now considered insufficient as a basis of Euclidean geometry, so other systems (such as Hilbert&#x27;s axioms without the parallel axiom) are used instead.

==Properties==
In Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, the first 28 Propositions and Proposition 31 avoid using the parallel postulate, and therefore are valid in absolute geometry. One can also prove in absolute geometry the exterior angle theorem (an exterior angle of a triangle is larger than either of the remote angles), as well as the Saccheri–Legendre theorem, which states that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle has at most 180°.

Proposition 31 is the construction of a parallel line to a given line through a point not on the given line. As the proof only requires the use of Proposition 27 (the Alternate Interior Angle Theorem), it is a valid construction in absolute geometry. More precisely, given any line &quot;l&quot; and any point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;l&quot;, there is &quot;at least&quot; one line through &quot;P&quot; which is parallel to &quot;l&quot;. This can be proved using a familiar construction: given a line &quot;l&quot; and a point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;l&quot;, drop the perpendicular &quot;m&quot; from &quot;P&quot; to &quot;l&quot;, then erect a perpendicular &quot;n&quot; to &quot;m&quot; through &quot;P&quot;. By the alternate interior angle theorem, &quot;l&quot; is parallel to &quot;n&quot;. (The alternate interior angle theorem states that if lines &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are cut by a transversal &quot;t&quot; such that there is a pair of congruent alternate interior angles, then &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parallel.) The foregoing construction, and the alternate interior angle theorem, do not depend on the parallel postulate and are therefore valid in absolute geometry.

In absolute geometry, it is also provable that two lines perpendicular to the same line cannot intersect (i.e., must be parallel).

==Relation to other geometries==
The theorems of absolute geometry hold in hyperbolic geometry, which is a non-Euclidean geometry, as well as in Euclidean geometry. Absolute geometry is inconsistent with elliptic geometry or spherical geometry: the notion of ordering or betweenness of points on lines, used to axiomatize absolute geometry, is inconsistent with these other geometries.

Absolute geometry is an extension of ordered geometry, and thus, all theorems in ordered geometry hold in absolute geometry. The converse is not true. Absolute geometry assumes the first four of Euclid&#x27;s Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with affine geometry, which does not assume Euclid&#x27;s third and fourth axioms.
(3: &quot;To describe a circle with any centre and distance radius.&quot;,
4: &quot;That all right angles are equal to one another.&quot; ) 
Ordered geometry is a common foundation of both absolute and affine geometry.

The geometry of special relativity has been developed starting with nine axioms and eleven propositions of absolute geometry. The authors Edwin B. Wilson and Gilbert N. Lewis then proceed beyond absolute geometry when they introduce hyperbolic rotation as the transformation relating two frames of reference.

==Hilbert planes==
A plane that satisfies Hilbert&#x27;s Incidence, Betweenness and Congruence axioms is called a Hilbert plane. Hilbert planes are models of absolute geometry.

==Incompleteness==
Absolute geometry is an incomplete axiomatic system, in the sense that one can add extra independent axioms without making the axiom system inconsistent. One can extend absolute geometry by adding various axioms about parallel lines and get mutually incompatible but internally consistent axiom systems, giving rise to Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. Thus every theorem of absolute geometry is a theorem of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry. However the converse is not true.

<text>The PS &quot;Alpena&quot; was a sidewheel steamer built by Thomas Arnold of Gallagher &amp; Company at Marine City, Michigan in 1866. She was operated by the Goodrich Line after being purchased from Gardner, Ward &amp; Gallagher in April 1868. The &quot;Alpena&quot; sank in Lake Michigan in the &quot;Big Blow&quot; storm on October 15, 1880, with the loss of all on board.

==Construction==

Built in 1866, by the Thomas Arnold of Gallagher &amp; Company of Marine City, Michigan, the &quot;Alpena&quot; was in length, in breadth, with a depth of . It was rated at 654 tons displacement. The vessel was driven by a steam engine, and photographs of the vessel show its walking beam suspended above the paddlewheels.

==Sinking==

At least 60 people died when the ship, also carrying a large cargo of apples, capsized in the middle of the lake. The ship was on a trip from Grand Haven, Michigan, to Chicago, Illinois, and was spotted at 8:00 am on October 16 in heavy seas. Some time later, probably due to a shift in the cargo on deck caused by the waves, it capsized and drifted northwest. On the 17th, debris including a piano came ashore in Holland, Michigan, while apples and wood debris were found at Saugatuck. A section of beach near Holland where debris was found is still called Alpena Beach. The loss of life is estimated at about 60-consisting of about 25 crew and about 35 passengers

==Similarly named ships==
Another ship named &quot;Alpena&quot; was a freighter built in 1874 and burned to the waterline in 1891. A tugboat named &quot;Alpena&quot; sank in 1943 at Huron, Ohio.

SS &quot;City of Alpena&quot; was a paddlewheel steamboat operating between Detroit and Mackinac Island by the Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company from 1893 to 1921. She was long, carried 400 passengers, and was powered by steam engines.

There is also a Great Lakes ship named &quot;Alpena&quot;, formerly the &quot;Leon Fraser&quot;, owned by Inland Lakes Management, an affiliate of Lafarge. It is used as a bulk freighter to haul cement. Built in 1942 and equipped with a steam turbine engine, it was originally long, in breadth with a depth of . It has a 15,550 ton capacity. In 1991, it was renamed, shortened and converted to a bulk cement carrier. The &quot;Alpena&quot; is a moderate sized ship in the Great Lakes fleet; the largest Lakers are almost twice its length and breadth and carry four times as much cargo. She is able to transit the canals of the St. Lawrence Seaway due to her small size.

== 2008 U.S. Senate election ==
On October 16, 2007, Pearce announced he would run for the Republican nomination to replace Pete Domenici in the U.S. Senate.

Fellow Republican representative Heather Wilson had previously declared her candidacy in that race. In late October 2007, Pearce made 130,000 automated phone calls to justify his opposition to the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) bill that would have provided health benefit to children, which the Wilson campaign claimed &quot;Pearce violated House ethics by urging those he called to contact him through his official, non-campaign phone number or check out his official, non-campaign Web site.&quot;

In March 2008, Pearce garnered 55% of the vote at the Republican pre-primary nominating convention. He narrowly won the June 3, 2008 Republican primary.

==Political positions==

=== Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories ===
In 2010, Pearce expressed skepticism that President Barack Obama was born in the United States.

=== Environment ===
Pearce has questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. He said that &quot;in fact the last 17 years there has not been global warming&quot; and that &quot;there are 31,000 scientists who say that human action is not causing the global warming at all&quot;.

Pearce had been a long-time advocate of oil and gas drilling in Otero Mesa.

=== 2020 election ===
After Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, Pearce and the New Mexico GOP cast doubt on the validity of the election results. Soon after the election was called for Biden, Pearce called for donations so Trump can challenge the results. In late 2020, Pearce supported the Trump campaign&#x27;s efforts to invalidate Biden&#x27;s victory in New Mexico, falsely claiming that massive voter fraud occurred. In his podcast, Pearce aired numerous conspiracy theories about the election, claiming he wanted to investigate possible &quot;anomalies&quot;. In December 2020, Pearce issued a statement supporting the &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot; lawsuit aiming to overturn the certification of Biden&#x27;s victory in multiple states, citing false claims of fraud.

On January 7, 2021, Pearce drew criticism when he claimed that alleged irregularities in the election &quot;tarnished&quot; democracy, soon after Biden&#x27;s electoral victory was certified by Congress. On January 9, Pearce tweeted that Trump &quot;will be our President FOREVER and no one can take that away from us.&quot; The tweet was soon deleted but Pearce defended his post, saying that Trump&#x27;s false claims of fraud were legitimate and insisted that there was massive voting irregularities in the election.

==Personal life==
Pearce has been married to his wife Cynthia for over 20 years. In 2013, Pearce published a memoir called &quot;Just Fly the Plane, Stupid!&quot;. It received attention because Pearce controversially wrote in the memoir that a wife should &quot;voluntarily submit&quot; to her husband, just as the husband should &quot;lovingly lead and sacrifice&quot;.

Pearce attends Taylor Memorial Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist church in Hobbs.

<text>Thomas Stewart Udall ( ; born May 18, 1948) is an American diplomat, attorney, and politician who had served as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States senator for New Mexico from 2009 to 2021. Udall also served as the U.S. representative for from 1999 to 2009 and New Mexico attorney general from 1991 to 1999. Born in Tucson, Arizona to the Udall family, he is the son of former U.S. Representative and Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and the nephew of former U.S. Representative Mo Udall. His cousin is Mark Udall, who concurrently served alongside him in the senate representing the neighboring state of Colorado.

Udall was first elected in the 2008 Senate race and was re-elected in 2014, and became dean of New Mexico&#x27;s congressional delegation. He did not seek a third term in 2020, making him the only Democratic senator to retire that cycle. On July 16, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Udall to serve as United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa.

==Early life, education, and law career==

Udall was born in Tucson, Arizona, to Ermalee Lenora (née Webb) and Stewart Udall, the Secretary of the Interior from 1961 to 1969. He is of partial Swiss ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side. He completed his undergraduate education at Prescott College, before going on to receive a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Cambridge and a Juris Doctor from the University of New Mexico School of Law.

==Early political career==
In 1982, Udall ran for Congress in the newly created 3rd district, based in the state capital, Santa Fe, and including most of the north of the state. He lost the Democratic primary to Bill Richardson. In 1988, he ran for Congress again, this time in an election for the Albuquerque-based 1st district seat left open by retiring twenty-year incumbent Manuel Lujan Jr., but narrowly lost to Bernalillo County District Attorney Steven Schiff. From 1991 to 1999 he served as Attorney General of New Mexico.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Udall ran for Congress again in 1998 in the 3rd district against incumbent Bill Redmond, who had been elected in a 1997 special election to replace Richardson. Redmond was a conservative Republican representing a heavily Democratic district, and Udall defeated Redmond with 53 percent of the vote. He was reelected four more times with no substantive opposition, including an unopposed run in 2002.

===Tenure===
As a U.S. Representative, Udall was a member of both the centrist New Democrat Coalition and the more liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus. He was a member of the United States House Peak oil Caucus, which he co-founded with Representative Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland.

===Committee assignments===
Udall sat on the United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations in the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies and the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch.

===Caucuses===
He was the Co-Vice Chair of the House Native American Caucus and Co-Chair of the International Conservation Caucus.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

In November 2007, Udall announced his run for the Senate seat held by retiring six-term incumbent Republican Pete Domenici. Potential Democratic rival Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez dropped out, handing Udall the nomination. New Mexico&#x27;s other two members of the House, 1st and 2nd district&#x27;s Heather Wilson and Steve Pearce, ran in the Republican primary. Pearce won the Republican nomination, and lost to Udall, who won 61 percent of the vote.

While Udall ran for Senate in New Mexico, his younger first cousin, Congressman Mark Udall, ran for the Senate in Colorado. Their double second cousin, incumbent Gordon Smith of Oregon, also ran for reelection. Both Udalls won but Smith lost.

===Tenure===
He voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, DREAM Act, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.

Udall was one of the first members of Congress to publicly express concern about the possibility of NSA overreach, a year before Edward Snowden&#x27;s 2013 disclosure of the PRISM program.

On March 25, 2019, Udall announced that he would not run for reelection in 2020.

In November 2020, it was reported that Udall was being considered for Secretary of the Interior in the Biden administration.

===Legislation===

On March 19, 2013, Udall introduced into the Senate the Sandia Pueblo Settlement Technical Amendment Act (S. 611; 113th Congress), a bill that would transfer some land to the Sandia Pueblo tribe.

Also during the 113th Congress, Udall introduced a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would reverse &quot;Citizens United&quot; and allow limits on outside spending in support of political candidates. The Amendment won the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 vote in July 2014.

In December 2014, Udall introduced a resolution condemning the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 and calling for the declassification of documents on United States involvement in the genocide.

In March 2015, Udall sponsored S. 697, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, a bill to amend and reauthorize the Toxic Substances Control Act. The legislation, as amended, was signed into law by President Barack Obama on June 22, 2016. It updated the nation&#x27;s safety system for thousands of chemicals in products like cleaners, paints, carpets and furniture. The bill initially faced criticism over the balance between federal and state authority to regulate chemicals, but after changes to the legislation, it earned broader support, including from liberal members of the Senate and the President. It passed by a vote of 403-12 in the House and voice vote in the Senate.

In March 2019, he and Rand Paul co-sponsored the bipartisan AFGHAN Service Act to compensate members of the armed forces and repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists at the end of the Afghanistan withdrawal.

<doc id="699310" wikidata="Q7347739" url="?curid=699310" title="Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth">
<text>Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth (7 September 1656 – 22 May 1725) was an Anglo-Irish politician and writer.

Molesworth came from an old Northamptonshire family. He married Hon. Letitia Coote, daughter of Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote, and Mary St. George. His father Robert (d. 1656) was a Cromwellian who made a fortune in Dublin, largely by provisioning Cromwell&#x27;s army; Robert Molesworth the younger supported William of Orange and was made William&#x27;s ambassador to Denmark. In 1695 he became a prominent member of the Privy Council of Ireland. The same year he stood for County Dublin in the Irish House of Commons, a seat he held until 1703. Subsequently, he represented Swords until 1715. In the following year, he was created Viscount Molesworth, of Swords, in the Peerage of Ireland.

Molesworth&#x27;s &quot;An Account of Denmark, as it was in the Year 1692&quot; (1694) was somewhat influential in the burgeoning field of political science in the period. He made a case for comparative political analysis, comparing the political situation of a country to the health of an individual; a disease, he reasoned, can only be diagnosed by comparing it to its instantiation in other people (Thompson, 495).

==Life and career==

Robert Molesworth was born on 7 September 1656, four days after the death of his father; his mother Judith Bysse later remarried Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu. He was probably raised by his mother&#x27;s family, the Bysses, at Brackenstown, near Swords, County Dublin.

In 1720, Molesworth and his grandson lost a significant investment in the South Sea Bubble. In Parliament, since his colleagues suggested there was no law under which to punish the perpetrators, he called for the Commons to &quot;upon this occasion follow the example of the ancient Romans, who, having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his father&#x27;s blood, made one to punish so heinous a crime as soon as it was committed; and adjudged the guilty wretch to be thrown alive, sewn up in a sack, into the Tiber&quot;. He concluded that he would see the same punishment applied to the directors of the South Sea Company, calling them the parricides of their country.

==Family==

With his wife Letitia, Molesworth had eleven sons and six daughters:

He inherited entailed land in Swords, and from his maternal great-grandfather, William Eccleston (d. 1720), and his uncle, William Eccleston (d. 1795), he inherited the estate of Belcotton and the townland of Termonfeckin, County Louth. The couple left issue.
** Magdalene Dorothea (1750-1824), married in June 1780 to George Kiernan of Blackhall, Dublin. They had issue.
** Henrietta Maria Phillips (d. 15 Dec 1792), married on 26 August 1766 to Rev Walter Shirley, Rector of Loughrea, co. Galway

==Death and succession==

The 1st Viscount died in Dublin on 22 May 1725 at the age of sixty-nine and was buried in Swords. His widow, Letitia, died &quot;of a great cold&quot; on St Patrick&#x27;s Day 1729 and was buried privately in St. Audoen&#x27;s Church in Dublin. Their eldest son, John, succeeded as 2nd Viscount Molesworth in 1725. John, in turn, was succeeded by his younger brother Richard a year later in 1726.

<text>Susannah McCorkle (January 1, 1946 – May 19, 2001) was an American jazz singer.

==Life and career==
A native of Berkeley, California, McCorkle studied Italian literature at the University of California at Berkeley before dropping out to move to Europe. She was inspired to become a singer when she heard Billie Holiday sing &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Right to Sing the Blues&quot;. She began her career in the early 1970s by singing at pubs in London with bandleader John Chilton. She also worked in London with Keith Ingham and Dick Sudhalter and recorded her first two albums, one a tribute to Harry Warren, the other to Johnny Mercer.

After moving back to the U.S. in the 1970s, she sang at the Cookery in Greenwich Village and the Riverboat in Manhattan. Later in her career, she often sang at the Algonquin Hotel. 

In 1988, PBS affiliate WMHT recorded the television special &quot;Susannah McCorkle and Friends: Jazz Meets Pop&quot; at Proctors in Schenectady, NY. It featured Gerry Mulligan, Mark Murphy, Gene Bertoncini and Michael Moore. &quot;The outstanding female jazz vocalist of her generation,&quot; said critic Francis Davis, attending the recording.

&quot;No More Blues&quot; (1989), her first album for Concord Jazz, was recorded with guitarists Emily Remler and Bucky Pizzarelli and pianist Dave Frishberg. Her writing was published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and the O. Henry Award Prize Stories.

&quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine named &quot;How Do You Keep the Music Playing&quot; (1985) as the album of the year, while critic Leonard Feather named it the vocal album of the year.

A breast cancer survivor, McCorkle suffered for many years from depression. She died by suicide at age 55 by leaping off the balcony of her apartment at 41 West 86th Street in Manhattan. She was alone in her home at the time. The police immediately entered her home after identifying her body and found no evidence of foul play. Suicide was ruled the cause of death.

<text>Ramesh Chandra Lahoti (1 November 1940 – 23 March 2022) was the 35th Chief Justice of India, serving from 1 June 2004 to 1 November 2005.

==Education and early career==
He joined the Bar in Guna district in 1960 and enrolled as an advocate in 1962. In April 1977, he was recruited directly from the Bar to the State Higher Judicial Service and was appointed a District &amp; Sessions Judge. After functioning as a District &amp; Sessions Judge for a year, he resigned in May 1978 and reverted to the Bar for practice mainly in the High Court. He was appointed the Additional Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 3 May 1988 and made permanent Judge on 4 August 1989. Lahoti was transferred to Delhi High Court on 7 February 1994. He was appointed a Judge of Supreme Court of India on 9 December 1998. He retired on his 65th birthday giving him a term of 17 months. His predecessor had a term of just 1 month.

Over the course of his Supreme Court tenure, Lahoti authored 342 judgments.

==Achievements==
Justice Lahoti, a noted jurist, was economic with words and probably the least vocal among recent Chief Justices. He served one of the longest terms as Chief Justice in recent years, retiring from office after 17 months.

In November 2004, Chief Justice Lahoti, broke ground with many of his predecessors who had expressed concern about the growing corruption within the judiciary, by proclaiming that the judiciary in India was &#x27;clean&#x27;. This was an astounding statement, especially in the light of frequent exposés in the media about errant judges across the country.

Chief Justice&#x27;s handling of judicial transfers has also attracted controversy. In February 2005, Chief Justice BK Roy was transferred from the Punjab and Haryana High Court to the Guwahati High Court, on Chief Justice Lahoti&#x27;s watch.

;Population control
Justice Lahoti upheld a Haryana law that did not allow those with more than two children to contest local body elections. He rejected arguments based on right to privacy and religion.

;Migrants
He quashed the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act on migrants to Assam.

==Post-retirement activities==
He was on the Advisory Board of the Indian International Model United Nations.
Justice Lahoti was also the Chairperson of the Advisory Board of the Faculty of Law at Manav Rachna University.

<doc id="699333" wikidata="Q1187369" url="?curid=699333" title="Direct (Vangelis album)">
<text>Direct is a studio album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in 1988. The album marks a new development in Vangelis&#x27; music, during which Vangelis moved his creative base from Paris to Athens in Greece, and it was his first album recorded in Athens after relocation from London.

==Overview==
According to the album sleeve notes the album and its title are inspired by Vangelis&#x27; method of composing and recording, relying on spontaneity, with the compositional and recording process occurring simultaneously in the studio. This process was largely facilitated by the use of a full spectrum of sound in the mixing and mastering process, due to custom MIDI performance systems designed for Vangelis and the Zyklus MIDI Performance System which was developed by technicians Bill Marshall and Pete Kellock.

==Release==
The CD tracks &quot;Dial Out&quot; and &quot;Intergalactic Radio Station&quot; were not on the LP. The LP has CD tracks 1-2-3-4-6 on side A, and CD tracks 7-8-10-11-9 on side B. In 2013 the album was released in remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings.

==Instrumentation==
The album is almost completely instrumental, employing mainly synthesizers and drum machines. Operatic vocals on &quot;Glorianna&quot; are performed by the Greek mezzo-soprano Markella Hatziano (uncredited) who sings both the soprano and the mezzo-soprano parts. The male narrative on &quot;Intergalactic Radio Station&quot; is performed by musician-technician Casey Young (thanked).

==Composition==
The album starts with &quot;The Motion of Stars&quot;, a symphonic electronica cut with plays of string synths over a constantly shifting sequenced background. &quot;The Will of the Wind&quot; features heavy drum machine backing, with sampled shakuhachi melody. &quot;Metallic Rain&quot; is similar to &quot;Alpha&quot;, it begins with a synthesizer solo and then builds to a rock-like section which adds drums, a guitar-like distorted synth sound, and heavy blues bass. &quot;Elsewhere&quot; starts with a sequenced backing, a lilting melody and then adds a drum machine. &quot;Dial Out&quot; fits the album. On &quot;Glorianna (Hymn a la Femme)&quot; Vangelis uses synthesizers and orchestral percussion to support the operatic vocals. &quot;Rotation’s Logic&quot; is sort of pop-electronica.

&quot;The Oracle of Apollo&quot; combines harp with synthesized strings and bass, capturing with &quot;Glorianna (Hymn a la Femme)&quot; the best elements in Vangelis style. &quot;Message&quot; has a sequenced bass and layers of strings at the start, which then develops into a melodic symphonic style. &quot;Ave&quot; is pop-rock. &quot;Intergalactic Radio Station&quot; in the end includes spoken vocals over a progressive rock synthesized background. &quot;First Approach&quot; ends the album with quiet synthesized cello and flute solos.

==Reception==
Jim Brenholts of Allmusic noted that it &quot;has strong elements of rock &amp; roll, symphonic synth ambience, and new age instrumental aspects. At the same time, the bold synthesizer strokes and washes fit the Berlin school of electronica&quot;. Henri Stirk from &quot;Background Magazine&quot; rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings 4/5 stars. He described the album to belong &quot;to the most interesting albums Vangelis recorded containing a style that could be called orchestral prog rock. Especially the synthesizer solos are a treat to the ears&quot;.

<text>Major Patrick Ferguson (1744 – 7 October 1780) was a British Army officer who designed the Ferguson rifle. He is best known for his service in the 1780 military campaign of Charles Cornwallis during the American Revolutionary War in the Carolinas, in which he played a great effort in recruiting American Loyalists to serve in his militia against the Patriots.

Ultimately, his activities and military actions led to a Patriot militia force mustered to put an end to his force of Loyalists, and he was killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain, at the border between the colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina. Leading a group of Loyalists whom he had recruited, he was the only regular army officer participating on either side of the conflict. The victorious Patriot forces desecrated his body in the aftermath of the battle.

==Early life==
Patrick Ferguson was born at Pitfour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on 25 May (Old Style)/4 June (New Style) 1744, the second son and fourth child of advocate James Ferguson of Pitfour (who was raised to the judges&#x27; bench as a Senator of the College of Justice, so known as Lord Pitfour after 1764) and his wife Anne Murray, a sister of the literary patron Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank.

Through his parents, he knew a number of major figures in the Scottish Enlightenment, including philosopher and historian David Hume, on whose recommendation he read Samuel Richardson&#x27;s novel &quot;Clarissa&quot; when he was fifteen, and the dramatist John Home. He had numerous first cousins through his mother&#x27;s family: these included Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet, Commodore George Johnstone, and Sir James Murray (later Murray-Pulteney).

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

Ferguson began his military career in his teens, encouraged by his maternal uncle James Murray. He served briefly in the Holy Roman Empire with the Scots Greys during the Seven Years&#x27; War, until a leg ailment – probably tuberculosis in the knee – forced him to return home. After recovering, now in peace-time, he served with his regiment on garrison duty. In 1768, he purchased a command of a company in 70th Regiment of Foot, under the Colonelcy of his cousin Alexander Johnstone, and served with them in the West Indies until his lame leg again began to trouble him. In 1770, Ferguson purchased the Castara slave plantation in Tobago. After Ferguson&#x27;s death, the plantation was inherited by his younger brother George, who had managed it since the early 1770s and developed it into a successful enterprise. Exports of rum, sugar, and molasses were sent back to Europe from it. After returning home in 1772, he took part in light infantry training, coming to the attention of General Howe. During this time, he developed the Ferguson rifle, a breech-loading flintlock weapon based on Chaumette&#x27;s earlier system.

==American War of Independence==

===1777===
In 1777, Ferguson went to the colonies to serve in the American War of Independence; commanding an experimental rifle corps equipped with his new rifle. However, after initial success, he was shot through the right elbow joint at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777 in Pennsylvania. Shortly before, he had had the chance to shoot a prominent American officer, accompanied by another in distinctive hussar dress, but decided not to do so, as the man had his back to him and was unaware of Ferguson&#x27;s presence. A surgeon told Ferguson in the hospital that some American casualties had said that General Washington had been in the area at the time. Ferguson wrote that, even if the officer were the general, he did not regret his decision. The officer&#x27;s identity remains uncertain; historians suggest that the aide in hussar dress might indicate the senior officer was Count Casimir Pulaski.
For some months after being wounded, Ferguson was at risk of having his arm amputated. During this time, he received news of his father&#x27;s death. Ferguson eventually recovered, although his right arm was permanently crippled.

===1778===
Ferguson resumed his military duties in May 1778, under the command of Sir Henry Clinton.

In October 1778, Ferguson was assigned to lead a raid in southern New Jersey to suppress privateers who had been seizing British ships. They were based around the Little Egg Harbor River, which empties into the Great Bay. Ferguson attacked their base in what is known as the Battle of Chestnut Neck.

About a week later, Ferguson was notified by a Hessian defector, Lieutenant Carl Wilhelm Juliat, who had returned to the British side after a furious argument with the American Lieutenant Colonel Carl Von Bose, that a detachment of Count Pułaski&#x27;s troops, under Von Bose&#x27;s command, was located nearby. Ferguson marched his troops to the site of Bose&#x27;s infantry outpost, which comprised fifty men and was a short distance from Pulaski&#x27;s main encampment. At first light on 15 October 1778, Ferguson ordered his men to use bayonets to attack the sleeping men of the American force. Pulaski reported that Ferguson&#x27;s Tories killed, wounded or took prisoner about 30 of his men in what the Americans called the Little Egg Harbor massacre.

Ferguson&#x27;s own account (under the pen-name &quot;Egg-Shell&quot;) expresses his dismay at Pułaski&#x27;s lack of preparations and failure to post look-outs. He said in his official report that little quarter could be given, and his men took only five prisoners. Ferguson reported that he did not destroy the three houses which sheltered the Americans because they were the dwellings of inoffensive Quakers, who were innocent civilians. Pułaski eventually led his mounted troops (Pułaski&#x27;s Legion) forward, causing Ferguson to retreat to his boats, minus a few men who had been captured. Ferguson reported his losses as two killed, three wounded, and one missing.

===1779===
Ferguson was commissioned as a Major in the 71st Foot on 25 October 1779.

===1780===
In 1780, the British Army sent General Lord Cornwallis to invade South Carolina and North Carolina. His mission was to defeat all American forces in the Carolinas and keep the two colonies within the British Empire. A key part of Cornwallis&#x27;s plan was to recruit soldiers from local Loyalists. To achieve this goal, General Clinton appointed Major Ferguson as Inspector of Militia in South Carolina. Ferguson&#x27;s mission was to recruit Loyalist militia in the Carolinas and Georgia and to intimidate any colonists who favoured American independence.

Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia Corps on 22 May 1780. His task was to march to the old Tryon County area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry, and protect the left flank of Cornwallis&#x27; main body at Charlotte, North Carolina. By this time, Ferguson had acquired the nickname of &quot;Bulldog&quot; among his militiamen.

After winning several victories over American forces, Cornwallis occupied Charlotte, in the summer of 1780. He divided his army and gave command of one section to Ferguson. Ferguson&#x27;s wing consisted of Loyalists he had recruited to fight for the British cause.

====Battle of Musgrove&#x27;s Mill====
On the evening of 18 August 1780 two hundred mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby, James Williams, and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove&#x27;s Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River. The Battle of Musgrove Mill, 19 August 1780 occurred near a ford of the Enoree River, near the present-day border between Spartanburg, Laurens and Union Counties in South Carolina. The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Loyalists had recently been reinforced by about a hundred militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join Ferguson. The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period, sixty-three Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and seventy were taken prisoner. The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded.

Some Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at Ninety Six, South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days previous.

====Pursuit of Shelby====
Shelby&#x27;s forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making good their escape. In the wake of General Horatio Gates’ blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories.

Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and fled back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, and by the next month on 25 September 1780, Colonels Shelby, John Sevier, and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the 7 October 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain near present day Blacksburg, South Carolina.

On 2 September, Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee/North Carolina border. By 10 September, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would &quot;lay waste to their country with fire and sword.&quot;

North Carolina Patriot militia leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier, from the Washington District (now northeast Tennessee), met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.

====Battle of Kings Mountain====
When Major Ferguson reportedly threatened to invade the mountains beyond the legal limit on westward settlement unless the colonists there abandoned the cause of American independence (Ferguson was actually in pursuit of Issac Shelby following the Battle of Musgrove&#x27;s Mill), the Overmountain Men first mustered at Sycamore Shoals organised a militia to eventually fight Ferguson and his Loyalist troops at King&#x27;s Pinnacle, an isolated ridge on the border between the Carolinas.

On 7 October 1780, the two armies clashed during the Battle of Kings Mountain. The battle went badly for the Loyalists positioned high on the mountain ridge, and during the fighting, Ferguson was shot from his horse. With his foot still in the stirrup, he was dragged to the Patriot side. According to Patriot accounts, when a Patriot approached the major for his surrender, Ferguson drew his pistol and shot him as a last act of defiance. Other soldiers retaliated, and Ferguson&#x27;s body was found with eight musket holes in it. Patriot accounts said their militia stripped his body of clothing and urinated on him before burial. They buried him in an oxhide near the site of his fall. Col. Benjamin Cleveland of North Carolina claimed Ferguson&#x27;s white stallion as a &quot;war prize” and rode it home to his estate of Roundabout.

One of Ferguson&#x27;s mistresses, &quot;Virginia Sal&quot;, was also killed in the battle and was buried with the officer. In the 1920s, the U.S. government erected a marker at Ferguson&#x27;s gravesite, which today is a part of the Kings Mountain National Military Park, administered by the National Park Service.

Ferguson&#x27;s personal correspondence reveals a man of intelligence, humour and charm. He also wrote several articles, satirical in tone, for publication in Rivington&#x27;s &quot;Royal Gazette&quot;, under the pseudonyms &quot;Egg-Shell&quot;, &quot;Memento Mori&quot; and &quot;John Bull&quot;.

He was survived by his mother, his brothers James and George, and sisters Annie, Elizabeth (Betty) (Mrs Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Birkhill), and Jean.

==Popular culture==
In the novel &quot;Horse-Shoe Robinson&quot; (1835) by John Pendleton Kennedy, an historical romance set against the background of the Southern campaigns in the American War of Independence, fictional characters interact with Ferguson as he is en route to the climactic scene in which he is killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain.

In Louis L&#x27;Amour&#x27;s book &quot;The Ferguson Rifle&quot; (1973), Ferguson stops by a poor family home on his way to the Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain and kindly gives his personal copy of the Ferguson rifle to a boy who later carries it West. Ferguson is shown to be a gentleman who displays all the appropriate social graces to a lady (the boy&#x27;s ill mother) and compassion to a family in need by giving up his personal firearm, asking only that the boy &quot;keep it always, and never use it against the king.&quot; (p7)
In NCIS episode 18 Season 10 “ Scoped” referenced by Ducky during autopsy as he explained to his assistant Jimmy about early snipers.
In Steve Ressel&#x27;s novel &quot;State of One&quot; (2010), Ferguson is the main antagonist featured against James Pariah, a soldier formerly under Ferguson&#x27;s command during the Battle of the Brandywine in 1777. Ferguson had been resurrected as a golem by the Leeds Witch with hopes of raising a golem army of similar soldiers, all armed with Ferguson rifles, to destroy the ratification of the US Constitution in September 1787. James Pariah cleaves to his old Ferguson rifle, sometimes referring to it as his wife, having modified it with special actions such as a spring-loaded knife in the stock.

In Sharyn McCrumb&#x27;s novel &quot;Kings Mountain: A Ballad Novel&quot; (2014), Ferguson is the central antagonist. Events leading to and the battle itself are covered from multiple viewpoints on both sides.

In the 2014 episode &quot;Patriots Rising&quot; of the television program &quot;The American Revolution&quot;, Ferguson is portrayed as having George Washington in his gunsight, but choosing not to shoot.

In the outdoor drama &quot;Horn in the West&quot;, Ferguson is portrayed harassing Daniel Boone&#x27;s Patriot friends ultimately leading to the Battle of Kings Mountain whereby his final defiant moments are carried out by shooting a Patriot with his pistol.

In Stephen Hunter&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;Targeted&quot;, Ferguson is given a short biographical treatment focusing on his prowess with firearms and is linked, genetically to Bob Lee Swagger, the fictional protagonist of Hunter&#x27;s long running series of novels.

Ferguson is mentioned in &quot;The Domination&quot;, a dystopian science fiction alternate history series by S.M. Stirling, where he is presented as the first governor of the fictional Crown Colony of Drakia.

Ferguson&#x27;s death is mentioned in the song &quot;Old World Rules And Empire Takes&quot; by Scottish folk singer Malcolm MacWatt.

<text>Nine Months is a 1995 American romantic comedy film produced, written and directed by Chris Columbus. The film stars Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum and Robin Williams. It is a remake of the French film, &quot;Neuf mois&quot;, and served as Grant&#x27;s first US starring role. It was filmed on location in the San Francisco Bay Area. The original music score was composed by Hans Zimmer. It was released on July 12, 1995, and received mixed reviews from critics, grossing $138 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner is in a long-term relationship with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. This changes when Rebecca declares that she is pregnant. When questioned by Samuel about her birth control, she replies that birth control is only 97% effective.

Samuel&#x27;s fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their three young unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he receives from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend and Gail&#x27;s brother. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling that Samuel is not ready to be a father, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail (who is also pregnant with a fourth child). Samuel tries to contact her, but she ignores him. Sean encourages him to move on, with Samuel trying new things, like rollerblading, getting an earring, and going to parties. But the thought of Rebecca still weighs heavily on his mind.

When a woman makes a move on Samuel at a party, he declines, saying that he is not ready to move on yet. He views an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, and decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his Porsche, buys a family car, and reconciles with Rebecca, much to Gail&#x27;s delight.

Samuel and Rebecca wed, and not long afterward, they go out to dinner. During an awkward moment when they bump into the woman who he met earlier at the party, Rebecca goes into labor. They rush to the hospital, where they meet Marty and Gail; who has gone into labor as well. Rebecca gives birth to their baby boy, who they name Samuel, and Gail gives birth to their fourth daughter, who they name Becky.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The movie premiered with strong interest and entered the box office rankings at number three. It trailed behind two other popular films, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot;. During its first weekend in theaters, it earned $12.5 million USD. Despite the competitive environment, the film attracted a significant audience. Following its initial release, Nine Months continued to perform well and ultimately grossed a total of $138.5 million USD worldwide. This success indicates that the movie resonated with viewers and maintained interest over time. Its impressive earnings reflect its popularity among moviegoers during its theatrical run.

===Critical response===
On film aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 27%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;&quot;Nine Months&quot; finds writer-director Chris Columbus playing to his worst comedic instincts -- and relying far too heavily on the trademark tics of his miscast leading man.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, saying, &quot;&quot;Nine Months&quot; is one of those movies where the outcome is abundantly clear to everyone but the hero, who remains in the hapless position of playing dumb because, if he didn&#x27;t, there wouldn&#x27;t be a plot.&quot; His review, and that of Gene Siskel, referenced Grant&#x27;s then-recent arrest for receiving oral sex from Estella Marie Thompson. Roger&#x27;s said &quot;the film&#x27;s box-office performance will be closely analyzed for clues about whether Grant&#x27;s career will be affected by the recent scandal. My guess is that the film, left to itself, would have performed only moderately at the box office, so if it does any better than that, the scandal can only have helped.&quot; Gene Siskel&#x27;s, in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, said that &quot;frankly [Grant&#x27;s] arrest for consorting with a hooker does limit our enjoyment of this fear-of-commitment comedy. We watch Grant, searching his face for clues to his behavior, instead of buying into his character. What if he hadn&#x27;t been arrested? &#x27;Nine Months&#x27; would still turn up lame because of its obvious plotting and the constantly irritating presence of Tom Arnold as a much-too-cheerful neighbor.&quot; He also remarked that Grant&#x27;s &quot;halting, blinking, stammering manner, which seemed so appealing in &#x27;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&#x27; comes across as mannered here. Obviously, we are going to have trouble for a while accepting him as an innocent. A better fit is his next role, in &#x27;An Awfully Big Adventure,&#x27; in which he plays a theatrical director with a controlling mean streak.&quot;

Todd McCarthy, a critic from &quot;Variety&quot;, described the film as &quot;an exceedingly safe and conventional Chris Columbus comedy.&quot; This statement suggests that the movie follows a familiar formula typical of Chris Columbus&#x27;s work. Columbus is known for creating feel-good films that appeal to a broad audience. His movies often contain lighthearted humor, predictable plots, and heartwarming moments.

By calling it &quot;exceedingly safe,&quot; McCarthy points out that the film does not take any risks. It sticks closely to established themes and storylines that are common in many comedies. Viewers who enjoy Columbus&#x27;s style might find comfort in this predictability, while others may see it as unoriginal and lacking in creativity. The term &quot;conventional&quot; further emphasizes the idea that the film does not break new ground. Instead, it relies on familiar tropes and character types that have been used repeatedly in the genre. Overall, McCarthy&#x27;s assessment highlights that while the film may entertain some, it does not push any boundaries or offer anything new.

===Hugh Grant&#x27;s opinion===
Grant has spoken disparagingly of his performance in &quot;Nine Months&quot;, stating in an interview with the SAG-AFTRA, &quot;I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I&#x27;d been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, 20th Century Fox, the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker.&quot;

On another occasion, Grant referred to director Chris Columbus as a &quot;genius&quot; and his &quot;brilliant&quot; co-stars, but further commented, &quot;You know, having been paid £20,000 or whatever it was, to do &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, if you&#x27;re suddenly paid millions, you think well I better ramp up my performance by 200 times. But all that means is that you overact grotesquely, which is what I did. So I&#x27;m always very apologetic to those people.&quot;

Grant said that his disappointment at his performance in &quot;Nine Months&quot;, following a preview of the film, led him to &quot;a Ken Russell kind of lunch&quot; and a sex act with Divine Brown in Los Angeles in 1995.

<text>Henry Compton ( – 7 July 1713) was an Anglican clergyman who served as the Bishop of London from 1675 to 1713.

==Early life==
Compton was born the sixth and youngest son of the 2nd Earl of Northampton. He was educated at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, but left in 1654 without a degree, and then travelled in Europe. After the restoration of Charles II in 1660 he became a cornet in his brother Charles&#x27;s troop of the Royal Regiment of Horse, but soon quit the army for the church. After a further period of study at Cambridge and again at Oxford, he graduated as a D.D. in 1669. He held various livings, including rector of Cottenham, and Witney.

==Episcopal career==
He was made Bishop of Oxford in 1674, and in the following year was translated to the see of London, and also appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal. He was also appointed a member of the Privy Council, and entrusted with the education of the two princesses, Mary and Anne. He showed a liberality most unusual at the time to Protestant dissenters, whom he wished to reunite with the established church. He held several conferences on the subject with the clergy of his diocese; and in the hope of influencing candid minds by means of the opinions of unbiased foreigners, he obtained letters treating of the question (since printed at the end of Edward Stillingfleet&#x27;s &quot;Unreasonableness of Separation&quot;) from Le Moyne, professor of divinity at the University of Leiden, and the famous French Protestant divine, Jean Claude.

In 1676 he was instructed by Lord Danby to conduct an ecclesiastical census of the population, which became known as the Compton Census.

In contrast to his liberality about Protestant dissent, Compton was strongly opposed to Roman Catholicism. On the accession of James II in February 1685 he consequently lost his seat in the council and his position as Dean of the Chapel Royal; and for his firmness in refusing to suspend John Sharp, rector of St Giles&#x27;s-in-the-Fields, whose anti-papal preaching had rendered him obnoxious to the king, he was himself suspended by James&#x27;s Ecclesiastical Commission in mid-1686. The suspension was lifted in September 1688, two days before the Commission was abolished.

At the Glorious Revolution Compton embraced the cause of William III and Mary II, being one of the Immortal Seven who invited William to invade England. He performed the ceremony of their coronation as the Archbishop of Canterbury William Sancroft considered himself still bound by his oath of allegiance to James II. Among other appointments, Compton was chosen as one of the commissioners for revising the liturgy. During the reign of Anne he remained a member of the privy council, and was one of the commissioners appointed to arrange the terms of the union of England and Scotland; but, to his bitter disappointment, his claims to the primacy were twice passed over. He died at Fulham on 7 July 1713, and was buried at All Saints Church, Fulham.

==Works==

Compton was a successful botanist. He also published, besides several theological works, &quot;A Translation from the Italian of the Life of Donna Olympia Maladichini, who governed the Church during the time of Pope Innocent X, which was from the year 1644 to 1655&quot; (1667), and &quot;A Translation from the French of the Jesuits&#x27; Intrigues&quot; (1669).

<text>In Christianity, the Great Commission is the instruction of the resurrected Jesus Christ to his disciples to spread the gospel to all the nations of the world. The Great Commission is outlined in Matthew 28:16–20, where on a mountain in Galilee Jesus calls on his followers to make disciples of and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

The Great Commission is similar to the episodes of the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles found in the other Synoptic Gospels, though with significant differences. Luke also has Jesus during his ministry dispatching disciples, including the seventy disciples, sending them to all the nations and giving them power over demons. The dispersion of the Apostles in the traditional ending of Mark is thought to be a 2nd-century summary based on Matthew and Luke.

The Great Commission has become a tenet in Christian theology emphasizing ministry, missionary work, evangelism, and baptism. The apostles are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and founded the apostolic sees, such as those at Corinth, Philippi, Ephesus, and Rome (see also Holy See). Preterists believe that the Great Commission and other Bible prophecies were fulfilled in the 1st century while futurists believe Bible prophecy has yet to be fulfilled at the Second Coming.

==History==
It is not known who coined the term &quot;Great Commission&quot;, though it may have been Justinian von Welz
and it was later popularized by Hudson Taylor.

==New Testament accounts==
==Interpretations==
The commission from Jesus has been interpreted by all evangelical Christians as meaning that his followers have the duty to go, make disciples, teach, and baptize. Although the command was initially given directly only to Christ&#x27;s eleven Apostles, evangelical Christian theology has typically interpreted the commission as a directive to all Christians of every time and place, particularly because it seems to be a restatement or moving forward of the last part of God&#x27;s covenant with Abraham in . 

Full Preterists believe that the Great Commission was already fulfilled based on the New Testament passages &quot;And they went out and preached everywhere&quot; (), &quot;the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven&quot; (), and &quot;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations&quot; ().
