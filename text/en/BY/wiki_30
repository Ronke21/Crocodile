<text>David Bowie (commonly known as Space Oddity) is the second studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released in the United Kingdom on 14November 1969 through Mercury affiliate Philips Records. Financed by Mercury on the strength of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, the album was recorded from June to October 1969 at Trident Studios in London. Gus Dudgeon produced &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, while Tony Visconti produced the rest of the album. It featured an array of collaborators, including Herbie Flowers, Rick Wakeman, Terry Cox and the band Junior&#x27;s Eyes.

Departing from the music hall style of Bowie&#x27;s 1967 self-titled debut, &quot;David Bowie&quot; contains folk rock and psychedelic rock songs, with lyrical themes influenced by events happening in Bowie&#x27;s life at the time, including former relationships and festivals he attended. &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, a tale about a fictional astronaut, was released as a single in July 1969 and became Bowie&#x27;s first commercial hit, reaching the UK top five.

The album was a commercial failure due to a lack of promotion, despite receiving some positive reviews from music critics. For its release in the United States, Mercury retitled the album Man of Words/Man of Music and used different artwork. RCA Records reissued the album under the title of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; following Bowie&#x27;s commercial breakthrough with &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; in 1972, using a contemporary photo of Bowie as the artwork. The reissue charted in both the UK and the US.

&quot;David Bowie&quot; has received mixed reviews in later decades, with many finding a lack of cohesiveness. Bowie himself later stated that it lacked musical direction. Debate continues as to whether it should stand as Bowie&#x27;s first &quot;proper&quot; album. &quot;David Bowie&quot; has been reissued numerous times, with bonus tracks and variance on the inclusion and listing of the hidden track &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;. Labels have used both &quot;David Bowie&quot; and &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as the title, with &quot;Space Oddity&quot; being used for a 2019 remix by Visconti.

== Background ==
David Bowie released his music hall-influenced self-titled debut studio album through Deram Records in 1967. It was a commercial failure and did little to gain him notice, becoming his last release for two years. After its failure, Bowie&#x27;s manager Kenneth Pitt authorised a promotional film in an attempt to introduce Bowie to a larger audience. The film, &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, went unreleased until 1984, and marked the end of Pitt&#x27;s mentorship to Bowie.

At the request of Pitt, Bowie wrote a new song for the film, &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, a tale about a fictional astronaut. Its title and subject matter were influenced by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). Bowie demoed the song in January 1969, recording the final &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; version on 2February. In April, Bowie recorded demos of tracks with guitarist John Hutchinson, including &quot;Janine&quot;, &quot;An Occasional Dream&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Quite&quot; (&quot;Letter to Hermione&quot;), &quot;Lover to the Dawn&quot; (&quot;Cygnet Committee&quot;) and another demo of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. In May, Bowie secured a record contract with Mercury Records on the strength of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The contract granted him enough finances to make a new studio album, to be distributed through Mercury in the United States and its affiliate Philips Records in the UK.

== Recording ==
To produce the new album, Pitt hired Tony Visconti, the producer of Bowie&#x27;s later Deram sessions. Visconti saw &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, the chosen lead single, as a &quot;novelty record&quot; and passed the production responsibility for the song to Bowie&#x27;s former engineer Gus Dudgeon. Dudgeon recalled: &quot;I listened to the demo and thought it was incredible. I couldn&#x27;t believe that Tony didn&#x27;t want to do it&quot;. Comparing the two producers in a 1969 interview, Bowie stated:


Recording for the new version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and its B-side &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; took place on 20June 1969 at London&#x27;s Trident Studios; Mercury wanted the single released ahead of the Apollo 11 moon landing. The lineup consisted of Bowie, Herbie Flowers (bass), Rick Wakeman (Mellotron), Terry Cox (drums), Junior&#x27;s Eyes&#x27; guitarist Mick Wayne and an orchestra arranged by Paul Buckmaster. After the single&#x27;s release on 11July, recording for the rest of the album continued five days later, with work commencing on &quot;Janine&quot;, &quot;An Occasional Dream&quot; and &quot;Letter to Hermione&quot;. Visconti recruited the rest of Junior&#x27;s Eyes minus their vocalist– Wayne and Tim Renwick (guitars), John Lodge (bass) and John Cambridge (drums)– as the main backing band for the sessions; Bowie hired Keith Christmas as an additional guitarist. Beatles&#x27; engineer Ken Scott also joined the sessions. According to Renwick, Bowie was &quot;kind of nervous and unsure of himself&quot;, and gave little direction during the sessions, which the author Paul Trynka attributed to numerous events in Bowie&#x27;s personal life at the time. Visconti had little production experience at the time but remained enthusiastic during recording.

Recording continued on and off for the next few months. Bowie wrote &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; following his father&#x27;s death on 5August. Eleven days later, he participated in the Beckenham Free Festival, commemorating &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot; after the event; recording for the song began on 8September. According to the biographer Nicholas Pegg, Bowie&#x27;s &quot;disillusion&quot; with the &quot;slack attitude&quot; of hippie culture caused him to reshape the lyrics of &quot;Cygnet Committee&quot;. &quot;God Knows I&#x27;m Good&quot; was attempted at Pye Studios in Marble Arch on 11September, but scrapped due to problems with the recording equipment. The song was re-recorded at Trident five days later. Recording completed on 6October.

== Music and lyrics ==
The music on &quot;David Bowie&quot; has been described as folk rock and psychedelic rock, with elements of country and progressive rock. According to the biographer David Buckley, Bowie based the music on the dominant styles of the times &quot;rather than developing a distinct music of his own&quot;. Kevin Cann finds the music encompasses &quot;a fusion of acoustic folk leanings with a growing interest in electric rock&quot;. Cann continues that &quot;David Bowie&quot; marked a turning point for the artist, in that lyrically he began &quot;drawing on life&quot; rather than writing &quot;winsome stories&quot;. Marc Spitz considers the album one of Bowie&#x27;s darkest, due to the death of his father. He writes that it reflects the artist&#x27;s &quot;darkening vision&quot; and depicts &quot;a man coming of age in a world that is increasingly depraved and barren&quot;. Susie Goldring of BBC Music calls &quot;David Bowie&quot; a &quot;kaleidoscopic album [that] is an amalgamation of [Bowie&#x27;s] obsessions – directors, musicians, poets and spirituality of a distinctly late-60s hue&quot;.

===Songs===
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; is a largely acoustic number augmented by the eerie tones of the composer&#x27;s stylophone, a pocket electronic organ. Some commentators have also seen the song as a metaphor for heroin use, citing the opening countdown as analogous to the drug&#x27;s passage down the needle prior to the euphoric &quot;hit&quot;, while noting Bowie&#x27;s admission of a &quot;silly flirtation with smack&quot; in 1968. &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; reflects a strong Bob Dylan influence, with its harmonica, edgy guitar sound and snarling vocal. Spitz describes the song as an &quot;extensive hard rock jam&quot;, while Buckley calls it a &quot;country-meets-prog-rock collision of ideas&quot;. A hidden track, subsequently titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;, featured at the end of the song on the original UK LP, but was excluded from the US Mercury release and RCA reissue of the album.

&quot;Letter to Hermione&quot; was a farewell ballad to Bowie&#x27;s former girlfriend Hermione Farthingale, who is also the subject of &quot;An Occasional Dream&quot;, a gentle folk tune reminiscent of the singer&#x27;s 1967 debut album. &quot;God Knows I&#x27;m Good&quot;, Bowie&#x27;s observational tale of a shoplifter&#x27;s plight, also recalls his earlier style. &quot;Cygnet Committee&quot; has been called Bowie&#x27;s &quot;first true masterpiece&quot; by Pegg. Commonly regarded as the track on &quot;David Bowie&quot; most indicative of the composer&#x27;s future direction, its lead character is a messianic figure &quot;who breaks down barriers for his younger followers, but finds that he has only provided them with the means to reject and destroy him&quot;. Bowie himself described the song at the time as a put down of hippies who seemed ready to follow any charismatic leader. &quot;Janine&quot; was written about a girlfriend of Bowie&#x27;s childhood friend George Underwood. It has been cited as another track that foreshadowed themes to which Bowie would return in the 1970s, in this case the fracturing of personality, featuring the words &quot;But if you took an axe to me, you&#x27;d kill another man not me at all&quot;.

The Buddhism-influenced &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; is presented in a heavily expanded form compared to the original guitar-and-cello version on the B-side of the &quot;Space Oddity&quot; single; the album cut features a 50-piece orchestra. &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot; is Bowie&#x27;s reminiscence of an arts festival he had organised in August 1969. Its drawn-out fade/chorus (&quot;The Sun Machine is coming down / And we&#x27;re gonna have a party&quot;) was compared to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;; the song has also been interpreted as a derisive comment on the counterculture it ostensibly celebrates. The background vocals for the crowd finale features Bob Harris, his wife Sue, Tony Woollcott and Marc Bolan. The outtake &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; has been described as featuring &quot;a lovely melody and an emotive lyric addressing familiar Bowie topics of alienation and social exclusion&quot;.

== Title and packaging ==
The album was released in the UK under the same eponymous title as Bowie&#x27;s 1967 debut, a move Trynka calls &quot;bizarre&quot;. The original UK cover artwork featured a facial portrait of Bowie taken by British photographer Vernon Dewhurst, exposed on top of a work by Hungarian artist Victor Vasarely with blue and violet spots on a green background. The artwork, titled CTA 25 Neg, was designed by Bowie and Mercury executive Calvin Mark Lee, who enthusiastically collected Vasarely&#x27;s works; Lee is credited as CML33. The back cover was an illustration by Underwood and depicted lyrical aspects from the album, stylistically similar to that of the Visconti-produced Tyrannosaurus Rex album &quot;My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They&#x27;re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows&quot; (1968). According to Underwood, the sketches included &quot;a fish in water, two astronauts holding a rose [and] rats in bowler hats representing the Beckenham Arts Lab committee types [Bowie] was so pissed off with&quot;. Pegg says these items appear in the final picture, along with a Buddha, a lit joint, an &quot;unmistakable&quot; portrait of Farthingale and &quot;a weeping woman (presumably the shoplifter in &#x27;God Knows I&#x27;m Good&#x27;) being comforted by a Pierrot&quot;, which he notes is &quot;remarkably similar in appearance&quot; to the &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; character Bowie later adopted. Underwood&#x27;s illustration is referred to on the sleeve as &quot;Depth of a Circle&quot;, which according to Bowie was a typo by the record label; he intended it to read &quot;Width of a Circle&quot;, a title he used for a song on his next album, &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; (1970). Apart from Bowie, none of the musicians who played on &quot;David Bowie&quot; were credited on the original pressings, due to the majority being under contract with other labels in the UK; song lyrics were presented on the inner gatefold sleeve.
For the US release in 1970, the album was renamed &quot;Man of Words/Man of Music&quot;, although Cann writes that this phrase was added to the cover to describe the artist and was not intended to replace the title. Mercury also changed Vasarely&#x27;s artwork in favour of a different, but similar photograph by Dewhurst, placed against a plain blue background. Cann criticises this artwork, stating that it &quot;suffered from sloppy technical application and the image appeared washed out as a result of poor duplication of the transparency&quot;. The musicians were credited on this release, while song lyrics still appeared on the inner gatefold. Cambridge later said that he &quot;was really pleased to see I was credited inside&quot; in 1991.

In 1972, as part of a reissue campaign undertaken by RCA Records in the wake of the commercial breakthrough of Bowie&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, &quot;David Bowie&quot; was repackaged with the title &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, after the opening track. For this release, the front cover was updated with a new photograph of Bowie taken the same year by photographer Mick Rock at Haddon Hall, Beckenham. The sleeve notes proclaimed that the album &quot;was NOW then, and it is still now NOW: personal and universal, perhaps galactic, microcosmic and macrocosmic&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; was released as a single on 11July 1969, with &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; as the B-side. The single initially favoured poorly on the charts but reached number five on the UK Singles Chart by early November, becoming Bowie&#x27;s first hit. The single&#x27;s success in the UK earned Bowie a number of television appearances throughout the rest of 1969, including his first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in early October. In mid-December, Bowie recorded a new version with Italian lyrics, titled &quot;Ragazzo solo, ragazza sola&quot; (meaning &quot;Lonely Boy, Lonely Girl&quot;), which was released as a single in Italy in 1970 and failed to chart.

Philips issued &quot;David Bowie&quot; in the UK on 14November 1969, with the catalogue number SBL7912. Cann states that Mercury considered releasing &quot;Janine&quot; as a follow-up single to &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, but were uncertain about the song&#x27;s commercial appeal and scrapped it. With little promotion from the label, the album was a commercial failure, barely selling over 5,000 copies by March 1970. The author Christopher Sandford attributed its failure to the majority of the album bearing little resemblance to &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

RCA&#x27;s 1972 reissue, released on 10November, reached number 17 on the UK Albums Chart, remaining on the chart for 42 weeks. It also peaked at number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in April 1973, remaining on the chart for 36 weeks. The album&#x27;s 1990 reissue charted at number 64 in the UK.

==Critical reception==
&quot;David Bowie&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics on release. Penny Valentine of &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; was positive, describing the album as &quot;rather doomy and un-nerving, but Bowie&#x27;s point comes across like a latter-day Dylan. It is an album a lot of people are going to expect a lot from. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be disappointed.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Music Now!&quot; offered similar praise, calling it &quot;[d]eep, thoughtful, probing, exposing, gouging at your innards&quot; and concluded: &quot;This is more than a record. It is an experience. An expression of life as others see it. The lyrics are full of the grandeur of yesterday, the immediacy of today and the futility of tomorrow. This is well worth your attention.&quot; Nancy Erlich of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in a review published over a year after its release, offered praise, calling it, &quot;a complete, coherent and brilliant vision&quot;.

Other reviewers offered more mixed sentiments. A writer for &quot;Music Business Weekly&quot; found that &quot;Bowie seems to be a little unsure of the direction he is going in&quot;, criticising the various musical styles found throughout, ultimately describing the record as &quot;over-ambitious&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Zygote&quot; praised &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot;, but felt the album as a whole lacks cohesiveness and is &quot;very awkward to the ear&quot;. The reviewer concluded that &quot;Bowie is erratic. When he succeeds, he&#x27;s excellent; when fails, he&#x27;s laborious.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau considered this album and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; to be &quot;overwrought excursions&quot;.

==Subsequent events==
Bowie&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, &quot;The Prettiest Star&quot;, was recorded in January 1970 and released as a single on 6March, with the &quot;David Bowie&quot; outtake &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; as the B-side. A love song to his soon-to-be-wife Angie and featuring guitar from Marc Bolan, it failed to chart. At the label&#x27;s request, Bowie remade &quot;Memory of a Free Festival&quot; for release as the next single, which was split across and A- and B-sides. The two-part single was released on 26 June and again, failed to chart. By this time, Bowie had completed recording &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, which featured a shift in musical style towards hard rock. Around the same time, Bowie fired Pitt due to continuing managerial disputes and hired Tony Defries as his new manager.

==Legacy==

&quot;David Bowie&quot; has continued to attract mixed reviews from critics, with many criticising its lack of cohesiveness. Dave Thompson of AllMusic wrote: Space Oddity&#x27; aside, Bowie possessed very little in the way of commercial songs, and the ensuing album emerged as a dense, even rambling, excursion through the folky strains that were the last glimmering of British psychedelia.&quot; Douglas Wolk of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; found that Bowie presents numerous ideas throughout the record, but does not know what to do with them, writing, &quot;he wears his influences on his sleeve and constantly overreaches for dramatic effect&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; Terry Staunton agreed, saying: &quot;&quot;Space Oddity&quot; may be regarded as the singer&#x27;s first &#x27;proper&#x27; album, though its mish-mash of styles and strummy experiments suggest he was still trying to settle on an identity.&quot;

Reviewing its 40th anniversary remaster, Mike Schiller of &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated that although it&#x27;s far from Bowie&#x27;s best, the record as a whole is &quot;not half bad&quot;, standing as a &quot;landmark&quot; in Bowie&#x27;s catalogue, and offering a glimpse at a man transitioning into the artist we&#x27;ve come to know&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Stuart Berman found that the record&#x27;s &quot;prog-folk hymnals&quot; were a precursor to the &quot;artful glam-rock&quot; sound that made Bowie a star. Reviewing for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, John Tatlock felt the album does not stand as Bowie&#x27;s first proper album, nor does it stand out on its own merit. He concludes that &quot;it captures its creator at a fascinating crossroads, and is much more than a fans-only curio&quot;. Rob Sheffield, in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995), considered the album to contain &quot;overripe hippie ballads&quot;, with only &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as &quot;a sign of things to come.&quot; The music writer Simon Reynolds wrote that the &quot;rush-recorded&quot; album, &quot;centred around Bowie&#x27;s twelve-string guitar&quot;, is arguably his worst album until the mid-1980s, adding: &quot;The debut, charming and tuneful, conveys that Bowie&#x27;s heart is in it, his delight in the jokes and play-acting palpable. None of that comes through in the second album.&quot;
Biographers have differing views on &quot;David Bowie&quot;. While Buckley calls it &quot;the first Bowie album proper&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray have said, &quot;Some of it belonged in &#x27;67 and some of it in &#x27;72, but in 1969 it all seemed vastly incongruous. Basically, &quot;David Bowie&quot; can be viewed in retrospect as all that Bowie had been and a little of what he would become, all jumbled up and fighting for control...&quot; Trynka similarly states that the record has an &quot;endearing lack of artifice&quot;, making it a &quot;unique&quot; entry in the artist&#x27;s catalogue. Pegg calls the album &quot;a remarkable step forward from anything Bowie had recorded before&quot;. He highlights &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot;, &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; and &quot;Cygnet Committee&quot; as showcasing Bowie&#x27;s evolution as a lyricist, but ultimately believes the &quot;monolithic reputation&quot; of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; does the album more harm than good. Spitz opines that while it is not as iconic as his 1970s works. &quot;Space Oddity&quot; &quot;is first-rate as trippy rock records go&quot;. Sandford writes that &quot;Space Oddity&quot; aside, the record lacks a &quot;voice&quot;, &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;clarity&quot;, finding the songs vary from &quot;mundane&quot; (the two tributes to Farthingale) and &quot;mawkish&quot; (&quot;God Knows I&#x27;m Good&quot;), but ultimately finds moments of brilliance like his 1967 debut, naming &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; and &quot;Janine&quot;.

==Reissues==
&quot;David Bowie&quot; was first released on CD by RCA in 1984. In keeping with the 1970 Mercury release and the 1972 RCA reissue, &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot; remained missing. The German (for the European market) and Japanese (for the US market) masters were sourced from different tapes and not identical for each region. In 1990, the album was reissued by Rykodisc/EMI with &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot; included as an independent song and three bonus tracks. This release, titled &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, used the 1972 cover photograph as its cover, while also incorporating a reproduction of the 1970 US front cover. It was issued again in 1999 by EMI/Virgin, without bonus tracks but with 24-bit digitally remastered sound and again including a separately listed &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;. The &quot;Space Oddity&quot; name was retained, while the original UK portrait was restored.

In 2009, the album was released by EMI/Virgin, under its original &quot;David Bowie&quot; title, as a remastered 2-CD special edition, with a second bonus disc compilation of unreleased demos, stereo versions, previously released B-sides, and BBC Radio session tracks. &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot; was again a hidden track. The 2009 remaster became available on vinyl for the first time in June 2020, in a picture disc release (with artwork based on the 1972 RCA reissue). Other reissues that have followed used the original &quot;David Bowie&quot; title and kept the UK artwork. In 2015, the album was remastered for the &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; box set. It was released in CD, vinyl and digital formats, both as part of this compilation and separately.

In 2019, &quot;David Bowie&quot; was remixed and remastered by Visconti, and released, with the &quot;Space Oddity&quot; title, in the CD boxed set &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;, and separately in CD, vinyl and digital formats. The new version of the album added the outtake &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; to the regular sequencing of the album for the first time, while omitting &quot;Don&#x27;t Sit Down&quot;.

<text>L&#x27;Escalade, or Fête de l&#x27;Escalade (from escalade, the act of scaling defensive walls), is an annual festival in Geneva, Switzerland, held each December commemorating the defeat of an attempt to conquer the Protestant city-state by the Catholic Duchy of Savoy in 1602. The celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on 12 December or the closest weekend.

Savoyard troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy attempted a surprise attack during the night of 11–12 December 1602, but were repulsed by the Genevese defenders. According to legend, this was possible thanks to individual acts of bravery by Genevese citizens, notably by local resident Catherine Cheynel (also known as &quot;la Mère Royaume&quot;), who dumped boiling vegetable soup on the invaders and alerted the townsfolk.

==Background==
For years, the duke coveted the wealth of Geneva. When Charles Emmanuel came to the throne of the House of Savoy in 1580, he aimed to make Geneva his capital north of the Alps and crush Protestantism. Pope Clement VIII offered encouragement, and in 1602 he appointed Francis de Sales as Catholic bishop of Geneva. Sales was an effective preacher who had recently been successful in re-Catholicizing the Chablais district of Savoy on the south side of Lake Geneva.

==Battle==
On the night of 11–12 December 1602—the darkest night of the year—the Savoyard forces, under the command of the seigneur d&#x27;Albigny, and those of Charles Emmanuel&#x27;s brother-in-law, Philip III of Spain, launched an attack on Geneva. Numbering over 2,000, the troops marched along the river Arve at night and assembled at Plainpalais, just outside the walls of Geneva, at around 2:00 a.m. on 12 December. The original plan was to send in a group of commandos to open the city gate and let the other troops in.

The citizens of Geneva defeated the invaders by preventing them from scaling the wall using cannon fire, and by fighting in the streets against the few who managed to climb over. The alarm was raised, the church bells were rung, and the Genevese were alerted. The night guard Isaac Mercier cut the rope holding up the portcullis, foiling the plan to open the main city gate. The citizens fought alongside the town militia and repelled the Savoyard invasion, forcing them to retreat.

In the fighting, the Genevese suffered 18 fatalities, while the Savoyards suffered 54 fatalities. 13 Savoyards who had been taken prisoner, including several well-born men, were summarily hung the following day as brigands since they could not be treated as prisoners of war, peace having been repeatedly sworn on the part of Savoy.

According to Genevese legend, Catherine Cheynel (&quot;&quot;Mère Royaume&quot;), a cook originally from Lyon and the wife of Pierre Royaume, seized a large cauldron of boiling hot vegetable soup and poured it on the attackers when they were scaling the walls. The Royaume family lived just above the La Monnaie town gate. The heavy cauldron of boiling soup landed on the head of a Savoyard attacker, killing him. The commotion that this caused also helped to rouse the townsfolk to defend the city.

After the defeat, the Duke of Savoy accepted a lasting peace, sealed by the Treaty of St. Julien of 12 July 1603.

==Celebration==

Although the armed conflict actually took place after midnight, in the early morning on 12 December, celebrations and other commemorative activities are usually held on 11 December or the closest weekend. Celebrations include a large &quot;marmite&quot; (cauldron) made of chocolate and filled with marzipan vegetables and candies wrapped in the Geneva colours of red and gold. It is customary for the eldest and youngest in the room to smash the &quot;marmite&quot;, while reciting, &quot;&quot;Ainsi périrent les ennemis de la République!&quot; &quot; (Thus perished the enemies of the Republic), referring to the legend of Catherine Cheynel. Other traditions include mulled wine, large servings of vegetable soup, and children in various types of costumes knocking on people&#x27;s doors and singing l&#x27;Escalade songs for candies. It is also common for children in school to prepare vegetable soup, which is served to parents and families that night. Teenagers tend to throw eggs, shaving cream, and flour at each other as part of the celebration. The high school students parade together by first going to &quot;conquer&quot; each other and end up in the central square of the old town after walking through the &quot;rues basses&quot; to the &quot;plaine de Plainpalais&quot; and back.

There is also a parade on Friday evening. The names of the eighteen Genevese fatalities—Jacques Billon died of his wounds a year later—are called out one by one. The historical procession on Sunday features around 800 people from old Genevese families wearing historical costumes, some of whom carry the remaining fragments of the ladders used by the Savoyards and ride horses. This parade, organised since 1926 by the Compagnie de 1602, attracts tens of thousand spectators annually.

=== Escalade Run ===
Since 1978 there has been another element to the celebration of l&#x27;Escalade, the Escalade Run, a road running event held the weekend of or preceding the night of 11 December (depending on whether or not it falls on a weekend). The run traditionally starts in the &quot;parc des Bastions&quot; and goes through the Old City of Geneva before eventually circling back to the start. It is one of the most significant annual events in Geneva. There are multiple events for different age groups.

== Legacy ==
The story of L&#x27;Escalade is told in a song called &quot;Cé qu&#x27;è l&#x27;ainô&quot;, written in a Franco-Provençal dialect around 1603 by an unknown author. The song has become the &quot;national&quot; anthem of Geneva. While the complete version comprises 68 stanzas, only four of them are usually sung.

It was also celebrated in verse by Samuel Chappuzeau in his &quot;Genève Délivrée&quot;.

<text>Paul Willard Merrill (August 15, 1887 – July 19, 1961) was an American astronomer whose specialty was spectroscopy. He was the first person to define S-type stars, in 1922.

==Career==
Merrill received his Ph.D. at the University of California (now UC Berkeley) in 1913. He spent the bulk of his career at Mount Wilson Observatory, from which he retired in 1952. He studied unusual stars, particularly long-period variable stars, using spectroscopy. He also studied the interstellar medium, including diffuse interstellar bands. Shortly before he retired, he succeeded in detecting technetium in the variable star R Andromedae and other red variables. Since technetium has no stable isotopes, it must have been produced recently in any star in which it is found, and this is direct evidence of the s-process of nucleosynthesis.

<doc id="700852" wikidata="Q1140083" url="?curid=700852" title="Scotiabank Saddledome">
<text>Scotiabank Saddledome is a multi-use indoor arena in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Located in Stampede Park in the southeast end of downtown Calgary, the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the Stampede Corral as the home of the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League, and to host ice hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics.

The facility also hosts concerts, conferences and other sporting championships, and events for the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. It underwent a major renovation in 1994–95 and sold its naming rights, during which its original name of Olympic Saddledome was changed to Canadian Airlines Saddledome. The facility was given the name Pengrowth Saddledome in 2000, after Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a ten-year agreement. It adopted its current name in October 2010 as Scotiabank signed on as title sponsor.

The Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary, who leases it to the Saddledome Foundation, a non-profit organization, to oversee its operation. Since 1996, it has been managed by the Flames. The Saddledome was damaged during the 2013 Alberta floods in June and July that year, but was repaired and reopened in time for the 2013–14 NHL season.

The arena&#x27;s roof is shaped like a horse saddle, thus earning the name &quot;Saddledome&quot;.

== Construction ==
Calgary had been served for 30 years by the Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total capacity of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL.

Calgary&#x27;s bid to host the 1988 Winter Olympics, coupled with the arrival of the Flames, drove the need to build a new arena. City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city&#x27;s new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the Victoria Park neighbourhood on the east end of downtown. Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of Airdrie were also considered.

The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city&#x27;s Olympic bid if necessary. City Council voted on March 3, 1981, to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated &quot;The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary&#x27;s) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary&#x27;s commitment to hosting the Games&quot;.

The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects. While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team. The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, similar to the 1971-built Scandinavium in Gothenburg, allowing for a pillar-free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by a third relative to traditional arenas, resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs. Additionally, the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city&#x27;s frequent temperature fluctuations. When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped. Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle. The winning name in the contest, &quot;Olympic Saddledome&quot;, was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary&#x27;s Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying &quot;It is neither Olympic nor western, and it&#x27;s not even dome&quot;.

The designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome, and were honoured by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000. As of 2008, the Saddledome was still reported as the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell. The Saddledome was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on September 27, 1987, for an article discussing the city of Calgary and the upcoming 1988 Olympics.

The location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary&#x27;s CTrain light rail transit system via the Victoria Park/Stampede station that stands parallel to Macleod Trail. Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way.

==History==

The arena was initially projected to cost $60 million to build, and later revised to over $80 million. Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $16 million cost overrun, resulting in a final cost of $97.7 million and an eight-month delay in its completion. Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place. Upset with the excess cost, opposition politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue. A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager, while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs.

When it opened on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government&#x27;s National Energy Program. During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the Edmonton Oilers, the standard of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government&#x27;s policies. The Oilers defeated the Flames 4–3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans.

The initial seating capacity was 16,605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed. As the Olympics neared, the Calgary organizing committee spent $1 million to add over 2,600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales. With a capacity of 20,016, the International Ice Hockey Federation noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games, and called the facility &quot;the finest international rink in the world&quot; The International Olympic Committee praised the city&#x27;s commitment to hosting the Olympics, noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary&#x27;s bid and positively influenced voters. The Saddledome was the first arena in North America designed to accommodate the larger international ice surface (international rinks are wider than NHL rinks). The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in the early &#x27;90s at 20,230.
The Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994, requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section. The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena. They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required. The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds. At the same time, they rejected a counter proposal for applying a ticket surcharge to pay the cost. Media reports claimed the team was considering relocating out of Calgary if council did not agree. Flames&#x27; owners denied the reports, but said they had threatened to build a new rink elsewhere in the city. City Council supported the Flames&#x27; proposal in a 9–6 vote following several months of negotiations.

Renovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl, an 1,172 seat club section, a new restaurant, expanded offices for the Flames, Saddledome management and Hockey Canada, as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new parkade structure. The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction, but was closed entirely between April and October 1995. The Saddledome officially reopened on October 25, 1995, for the Flames&#x27; first home game of the 1995–96 NHL season.

Prior to its reopening, the Flames signed a deal with Canadian Airlines to rename the facility. Under a 20-year agreement worth approximately $1 million per year, the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome. Removing the &quot;Olympic&quot; moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council, though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city. The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by Air Canada and ceased operations. Pengrowth Management Ltd. signed a 10-year agreement that gave the facility the name Pengrowth Saddledome.

The arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years. In 2004, the Flames spent $1 million on a LED &quot;power ring&quot; display that lines the facing of the second level. The JumboTron that was installed in 1995 was replaced in 2006 with a new HD video scoreboard. Along with the new board, the previous speakers were replaced with Apogee ALA-9 arrays in 2007. Manufactured by Daktronics and branded as the &quot;Enmax Energy Board&quot;, the display contained 12 screens and two LED ribbons. A new scoreboard was installed in 2024, branded as the &quot;Sportsnet Scoreboard&quot;; which contains four, 30-foot (9.1 m)-tall displays with a total area of , and a 40-foot (12 m) &quot;halo&quot; ring.

===2013 flood===

The Saddledome was one of many buildings impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. The event level of the arena was filled with water, also wrecking the high definition scoreboard that had been sitting on the rink floor during the summer downtime, while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a &quot;total loss&quot;. He added that the team&#x27;s equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the 2013–14 Calgary Flames season. Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 Calgary Stampede.

Crews worked around the clock to repair the facility; Saddledome director of building operations Robert Blanchard estimated that 650,000 man hours of work was performed on the facility and noted that they had compressed a six-month project into two. The facility was granted its occupancy permit in late August, and the first event following the Saddledome&#x27;s reopening was an Eagles concert on September 11. The first hockey game was September 14, a Flames pre-season contest.

==Events==

As the home of the Flames, the Saddledome hosted the 1985 NHL All-Star Game, and the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. The Flames have played three Stanley Cup Finals series in the Saddledome: 1986, 1989 and 2004. The arena is also the home of the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Hitmen won the President&#x27;s Cup in 1999 before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17,139. Playing in the largest arena in the WHL, the Hitmen also hold league records for overall attendance (362,227 in 2004–05), as well as single game (19,305 in 2007–08). The Saddledome is also the home of the Calgary Roughnecks of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and hosted the 2005 NLL All-Star Game. It has hosted the NLL Champion&#x27;s Cup game four times: 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. The Roughnecks would raise the Cup on their home floor in all of these games except 2014. The stadium was one of the venues for the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

The opening of the Saddledome allowed Calgary to host major musical acts that were bypassing the city in the early 1980s, because the city&#x27;s existing facilities were not large enough to accommodate the industry&#x27;s top performers.

The Moody Blues were the first musical act to appear with Stevie Ray Vaughan opening, in November 1983, while Rod Stewart has made the most appearances in the Dome, 11. Many other top acts have made stops in the Saddledome; however, the inability of the roof to support the massive light, speaker and special effect rigs that some performers currently use has led the city to again be bypassed for some major tours.

In addition to hockey and figure skating at the 1988 Olympics, the Saddledome has been the site of numerous major national and international events. The facility has hosted Brier, the Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship, on four occasions (1997, 2002, 2009 and 2015). It also hosted the women&#x27;s championship, the Tournament of Hearts in 1995. The 2006 World Figure Skating Championships was also held in the arena. The WWF pay-per-view event In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede was also held at the Saddledome in July 1997. Among non-sporting events, the Saddledome most recently hosted a public address by the Dalai Lama in 2009 that was attended by 15,000 people. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth II attended a celebration of Alberta&#x27;s centennial at the Saddledome.

It has also hosted PBR Bud Light Cup events; in 1998 and 1999 the event was known as &quot;Cody Snyder&#x27;s Bullbustin&#x27;&quot;, and in 2000 and 2001 the event was called the Professional Bull Riders Canadian Open. The Saddledome has also been a host for PBR Canada events.

On October 3, 2016, the Saddledome hosted a National Basketball Association preseason game between the Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets.

On July 21, 2012, the Saddledome hosted an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, which was UFC 149. Six years later, on July 28, 2018, the Saddledome hosted another UFC event, which was UFC on Fox: Alvarez vs. Poirier 2.

The arena was also the site of the 1990 Liberal Party leadership convention.

==Amenities==
The Saddledome seats 19,289 for hockey and lacrosse, with different capacities for other events depending on the arena&#x27;s configuration. It has 72 luxury suites, 41 of which were constructed at the top of the lower bowl in 1995 and 31 were constructed at the top of the second level when the facility was built. There are also six party suites on the corners of the upper loges that are rented on an event by event basis. Sections 115 through 122 of the lower bowl form The Club and offers in-seat concession service at Flames games. This was later expanded to the remainder of the lower bowl during Flames, Hitmen and Roughnecks games via the Saddledome Live app.

The Club features a private dining room available during Flames games, large concerts and private events. Dutton&#x27;s Canadian Lounge is a sports bar located at the west entrance to the building. There are three additional restaurants within the facility: The Saddleroom Grill, the Alumni Lounge and the King Club. The Iconic Platinum Club is a 188-seat executive club accessible with a purchased membership. It features a private bar and restaurant as well as a fully functional business centre.

==Saddledome Foundation==
The City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50-years to the non-profit organization. Its mandate was to &quot;oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local, provincial and national level&quot;. The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors: three appointed by the city, three appointed by the province, and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association (now WinSport Canada), Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena, and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames, earned 15% of gross concession sales, 50% of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena&#x27;s revenues. The Flames signed a 20-year lease in 1983 that earned them 70% of advertising revenues and 90% of ticket revenues. The Stampede earned 85% of concession revenues and all revenue from parking.

As part of the 1994 deal with the city, the Flames bought out the Stampede&#x27;s contract for $20 million and took over management of the facility. While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994–95 renovations, the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs, as well as any further renovations. The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $14.5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time. The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport. From its inception through 2007, it had allocated over $20 million toward this cause.

==Future==

The Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL and the oldest among the seven Canadian franchises, fuelling speculation that it is due to be replaced. Only Madison Square Garden in New York City and Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle are older than the Saddledome; however, Madison Square Garden underwent significant interior renovations during the NHL off-seasons between 2010 and 2013, while Climate Pledge Arena was rebuilt under the original 1962 superstructure of the Washington State Pavilion from 2018 until its reopening in 2021. Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were &quot;five to eight years away&quot; creating the expectation that the team hoped to have a new arena built for when their lease was due to expire in 2014, but such plans never came to fruition. Team chairman Murray Edwards argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts is growing increasingly limited as the facility ages. Along with Edwards, sports financial analysts note that newer arenas generate far more revenue for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames.

It is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary. While NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi and alderman John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena. King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but are not ready to release them. Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city&#x27;s C-train light rail transit line below ground and run straight into a new facility.

In 2015, Calgary Sports and Entertainment proposed CalgaryNEXT—a sports complex in the western downtown area that would feature a new arena and football stadium to replace the Saddledome and McMahon Stadium. The proposal was shot down in 2017 by Calgary&#x27;s city council, who voted to support a &quot;plan B&quot; of a new arena on a site adjacent to the existing Saddledome, which is currently used as a parking lot for the Stampede grounds.

On September 12, 2017, King stated that the team was no longer pursuing the arena, as &quot;we&#x27;ve been working for a long time trying to come up with a formula that really works to replace this building and we really put our best foot forward and I’ve come to the conclusion sadly and I’m very disappointed that I don&#x27;t think we can make a deal that works for us&quot;. Mayor Nenshi subsequently proposed a partnership wherein portions of the cost of &quot;plan B&quot; would be covered by the city, and the rest covered by the team ownership and user surcharges. King objected to this proposal.

Critics alleged that the Flames had been trying to use the issue of a new arena to influence the 2017 municipal elections, where Nenshi was elected for a third term as mayor of Calgary. King denied that this was the case, stating that &quot;we did not raise this as an election issue: it became an election issue&quot;.

On July 30, 2019, Calgary city council had approved a $550 million Event Centre to replace the Saddledome. The new Event Centre would have been located to the north of the Saddledome in the Victoria Park neighbourhood. The city of Calgary would own the arena while Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation would be responsible for the facility&#x27;s operation and maintenance under a 35-year, no-relocation lease agreement. The new arena had a planned capacity of around 19,000; plans for the Event Centre also included the possibility for a smaller arena to replace the now-demolished Stampede Corral. The Saddledome would have been subsequently demolished had the proposed Event Centre been built.

On April 14, 2021, the deal for the new arena was put on hold by Calgary city council over budget concerns.

On July 26, 2021, the city announced the cost of the arena had gone from $550 million to $608.5 million. The arena was planned on an inverted bowl design which may not have worked on that particular piece of land and would&#x27;ve been bad for accessibility. As the engineers got further into design work, they realized there are some other things, there weren&#x27;t enough women&#x27;s bathrooms as well as there may be too many luxury boxes and not enough seats for regular people. To address cost overruns, both the City of Calgary and Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation would each be putting forward an additional $12.5 million. The clause was part of the original deal signed in 2019 and has already been approved by council. The Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation has agreed to cover anymore cost overruns.

On December 22, 2021, Calgary Sports and Entertainment pulled out of the deal, citing disagreements in significant infrastructure costs ($15 million) and climate mitigation costs ($4 million); costs not previously identified as project costs by CMLC or the City nor included in the $608.5 million target budget in July 2021. Despite this, CSEC intends on staying in the Saddledome.

At a press conference on April 25, 2023, it was announced that the Calgary Event Centre project, estimated to cost $1.22 billion, would be moving forward consisting of a new arena, indoor rink, and indoor and outdoor plazas. The city would pay $537 million, with the Flames owners and the province paying $356 million and $300 million over three years, respectively.

On October 5, 2023, the City of Calgary, Province of Alberta, and CSEC announced that they had finalized agreements for the Scotia Centre, with district improvements worth $1.22 Billion. On July 22, 2024, ground was broken for the Calgary Event Centre, and its final design and name was unveiled as Scotia Place; the new arena is scheduled to open in time for the 2027–28 NHL season.

<text>CFRB (1010 AM) is a commercial radio station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is owned by Bell Media and carries a News/Talk radio format. Its studios and offices are in the Entertainment District at 250 Richmond Street West.

One of the oldest surviving radio stations active in Toronto, CFRB went on the air on February 19, 1927, as 9RB owned by Edward S. Rogers Sr., with the callsign derived from its parent Rogers Vacuum Tube Company, and the station moved to its current 1010 AM frequency in 1948. Throughout ownership changes for most of the decade and its format remained intact, the station was acquired by Slaight Broadcasting in 1985, before being acquired by Astral Media in 2007 and ultimately sold to Bell Canada, rival company of Rogers Communications, founded by Rogers Sr.&#x27;s son, Ted Rogers Jr., in 2013.

CFRB is a clear channel station powered at 50,000 watts, the maximum permitted in Canada. While it is a Class A station, it also must protect CBR in Calgary, which shares Class A status on 1010 AM. CFRB uses a four-tower array directional antenna in the Clarkson neighbourhood of Mississauga. CFRB is simulcast on shortwave station CFRX at 6.07 MHz in the 49 metre band and on sister station 99.9 CKFM-FM-HD2, a digital subchannel. CFRB is also heard across Canada on Bell Satellite TV channel 964.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
CFRB first signed on the air on February 19, 1927. It is not Toronto&#x27;s very first radio station, but it is the city&#x27;s oldest English-language broadcaster still operating today. (CJBC, which now operates in French, was founded in 1925.) It was founded by the Rogers Vacuum Tube Company. The station was used to promote Edward S. Rogers Sr.&#x27;s invention of a batteryless radio receiver that could be operated using alternating current and therefore did not need the cumbersome battery that had previously been required. The station itself was a demonstration of Rogers&#x27; application of his invention to radio transmitters as well as receivers, a development that allowed for a signal that reproduced voices and music more clearly. The new type of transmitter also made CFRB the world&#x27;s first all-electric radio station. The letters &quot;RB&quot; in the station&#x27;s callsign stand for &quot;Rogers&#x27; Batteryless&quot;.

The station began transmitting on an experimental basis in January 1927 as 9RB, before being converted to commercial operation a few weeks later, as CFRB. Those call letters have been used continuously since then. On February 19, the inaugural broadcast was a live symphony orchestra concert conducted by Jack Arthur. During its first years, CFRB leased time to two phantom stations: CNRX, owned by Canadian National Railways and providing programs of Canada&#x27;s first radio network, and CPRY, owned by the CNR&#x27;s rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CNR&#x27;s network was discontinued in 1933, with many of its assets eventually passing to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and the CPR&#x27;s radio service was discontinued in 1935.

CFRB&#x27;s first studios were in a mansion on Jarvis Street north of Wellesley Street, built by the family of Hart Massey. In 1929, the station moved to purpose-built studios at 37 Bloor Street West. In the same year, the station became a network affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System.

In 1932, CFRB began airing the &quot;General Motors Hockey Broadcast&quot;, which had originated on the CNR&#x27;s network. This program eventually became &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, and continued to be aired by CFRB for many years, despite also airing on the CBC&#x27;s flagship station CBL, and continues to this day on CBC Television and Rogers Sportsnet.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, CFRB was the radio broadcaster for the Toronto Santa Claus Parade.

In 1937, CFRB began to simulcast on shortwave station CFRX at 6070 kHz.

Following the sudden death of Edward S. Rogers Sr. in 1939, Rogers Majestic Corporation Limited was sold in 1941 and became Standard Radio Limited. In turn, the company was acquired by Argus Corporation in 1946.

On November 1, 1946, Wally Crouter joined CFRB. He eventually became its morning drive time host, a position he would hold until his retirement on November 1, 1996, after exactly fifty years at the station.

=== Changing frequencies and studios ===
CFRB and CJBC, owned by the CBC, made a frequency switch on September 1, 1948. CFRB moved to 1010 while CJBC took over the Class I-A clear-channel frequency at 860, previously used by CFRB. The CBC wanted its stations in major cities to be on Class I-A frequencies. But CFRB, which had been running at 20,000 watts, was boosted to 50,000 watts, giving it wide coverage over Southern Ontario.

Beginning in 1948, through until the early 1970s, CFRB made several unsuccessful bids for a licence to operate a television station in Toronto.

In 1965, CFRB moved its studios from 37 Bloor Street West to 2 St. Clair Avenue West (at Yonge Street). At around the same time, Standard Radio Limited was renamed Standard Broadcasting.

A long-lasting show, &quot;Calling All Britons&quot; featuring news, sports scores and music from Britain, began in 1965. It was hosted by Ray Sonin until his death in 1991.
=== New ownership ===
In 1978, Argus Corporation was acquired by Conrad Black and his brother Montegu, thus also giving them ownership of Standard Broadcasting. In November 1985, Slaight Broadcasting acquired Standard from the Blacks. In October 2007, Slaight sold Standard to Astral Media.

Ted Rogers, the communications mogul and son of CFRB&#x27;s founder, had vowed to re-acquire the station that his family had lost after his father&#x27;s death, and considered his failure to do so his greatest disappointment. Reports indicate that he continued to attempt to re-acquire CFRB right up until his death in December 2008.

In July 2013, with a buyout of Astral Media, CFRB was acquired by Bell Media, a subsidiary of Bell Canada which already owns the CTV Television Network and rival competitor to Rogers Communications founded by Ted Rogers. Shortly after the purchase, Bell announced that it would move the studios and offices of CFRB and sister station CKFM-FM from their long-time location at St. Clair Avenue and Yonge Street, to 250 Richmond Street West at Richmond and Duncan (which already houses the operations of sister radio stations, CHUM and CHUM-FM). The building is adjacent to 299 Queen Street West located at Queen Street and John Street (which already houses the operations of several Bell Media specialty television channels including CP24 and MuchMusic). The move took place on May 10, 2014.

== Transmitter ==
The transmitting antennas for CFRB are a prominent landmark along Lake Ontario, a four-tower array in the Clarkson neighbourhood of Mississauga. The towers are visible from over 100 km away. They are used as a landmark for navigation by pilots, on approach to Toronto Pearson International Airport, or to Toronto Island Airport. The antenna array consists of four vertical masts, 168 metres (550 feet) in height.

CFRB was one of few stations to broadcast in AM stereo, starting in 1984. However, since AM stereo never achieved wide acceptance, the station deactivated its stereo broadcasting system in the mid-1990s.

The transmitter is located on Royal Windsor Drive, 200 meters west of the intersection of Lakeshore Road West (former King&#x27;s Highway 2) and Southdown Road, at the coordinates .

=== Shortwave relay ===

CFRX is the international shortwave relay of CFRB. It transmits with a power of 1 kW on 6.07 MHz in the 49-meter shortwave band. CFRX signed on the air on February 11, 1937, 10 years after CFRB began. In 1948, CFRB was considering discontinuing its shortwave relay when the station was planning the relocation of its transmitter from Aurora to a new complex at Clarkson, Ontario but decided to keep the CFRX transmitter and move it to Clarkson after receiving hundreds of letters from listeners. CFRX is operated on the north end of the same site as CFRB&#x27;s main transmitter building.

The shortwave signal was originally directed to the northwest in order to provide service towards northern Ontario and western Canada. When a new transmitter was installed in the 2000s, it was made omni-directional with the intention of providing availability to Canadians travelling to or vacationing in the United States, particularly snowbirds.

== Programming ==
CFRB has local hosts most of the day, though several shows are syndicated to other Bell Media talk stations in Canada. The 11 p.m. newscast is simulcast from co-owned CFTO-DT Channel 9 &quot;CTV Toronto&quot;.

CFRB traditionally had Toronto&#x27;s top-rated morning drive show with host Wally Crouter, who joined the station in 1946 and a few weeks later began hosting its morning drive show, originally called &quot;Top O’ The Morning&quot; and later the &quot;Wally Crouter Show&quot;, until his retirement in 1996. At its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, the show drew half-a-million listeners. CFRB&#x27;s morning show has trailed CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Metro Morning&quot; since 2003.

As of 2024, Newstalk 1010&#x27;s Monday to Friday schedule consisted of &quot;Moore in the Morning&quot; with John Moore in the morning drive slot, Jerry Agar in mid-morning followed by &quot;The Vassy Kapelos Show&quot; over midday, &quot;The Rush&quot;, with rotating hosts, in the afternoon, the simulcast &quot;CTV News Toronto&quot; in the late afternoon drive slot, followed by &quot;Newstalk Tonight&quot; with Jim Richards in the evening and a simulcast of &quot;CTV National News&quot; in the late evening followed by repeats overnight. An attempt to schedule Jim Richards in a national overnight shift in 2021 proved unsuccessful. &quot;The Rush&quot; was hosted by Reshmi Nair and Scott MacArthur from 2022 to 2023 and had previously been hosted by Jay Michaels and Ryan Doyle.

Weekend programming consists largely of repeats of programs from the previous week as well as some original programming such as &quot;Taking Stock&quot;, a business show with Amanda Lang, talent show &quot;Free For All&quot; with Amanda Galbraith, advice programs such as a home improvement show, a pet show, a real estate show, an employment law show, &quot;Tech Talk&quot; with Marc Saltzman, &quot;The Disability Law Show&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Money Show&quot;, &quot;Ask The Experts&quot; with Iain Grant, and several podcasts as well as simulcasts of CP24 and &quot;CTV News&quot;. Avrum Rosensweig co-hosted and produced a show with Marty Galin about food and restaurants called &quot;Marty &amp; Avrum: The Food Guys&quot;. on Saturdays from 6-7pm. 

In August 2009, CFRB announced it was laying off a number of its well-known personalities, including Michael Coren, Paul and Carol Mott, Christina Cherneskey, Jacqui Delaney and newscaster Kris McCusker as part of a move to open a &quot;new chapter&quot; at the station.

The second phase of the shake up was announced in the fall with John Moore moving from afternoon drive to morning, replacing Bill Carroll, who moved to the 9 am to 1 pm slot. Jim Richards took over the 1pm to 4pm slot formerly held by The Motts and Michael Coren and former Ontario Progressive Conservative leader John Tory (later mayor of Toronto) took over the late afternoon slot vacated by Moore. In 2010, Carroll left CFRB to take a job in Los Angeles and was replaced by Jerry Agar.

In early 2013, the station added Astral&#x27;s new late night &quot;Humble &amp; Fred&quot; show.

Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow started on CFRB contributing to Sundays with John Downs and then began hosting his own show, &quot;The City&quot; (beginning in August 2011) every Sunday on CFRB between 1-3PM. Matlow discussed city hall&#x27;s top headlines with Toronto&#x27;s city councillors and the week&#x27;s news makers. From February 2012 until November 2013, CFRB aired &quot;The City&quot;, featuring Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and his brother and city councillor Doug Ford. The Ford brothers&#x27; version of the show was often controversial and was allegedly used by the Fords as a platform to attack their political enemies, prompting various complaints. The show was cancelled in November 2013 after Mayor Ford admitted using crack cocaine after several months of denials. The Fords were replaced in their time slot by Mark Towhey who had previously been Mayor Ford&#x27;s Chief of Staff until he was fired by Ford on May 23, 2013 at the height of Ford&#x27;s crack video scandal. Towhey&#x27;s show continued until 2021.

In 2016, Tim Hudak, the former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, was given a show on Sundays which he hosted until 2021.

In February 2021, Bell Media eliminated 210 positions at its media properties across Canada. Included in the layoffs were Newstalk 1010 news director Kym Geddes, and several broadcasters including weekend host Ted Woloshyn, &quot;Nightside&quot; host Barb DiGiulio, news reporters and anchors Hayley Cooper, David McKee, Lucas Meyer, and Claude Feig.

<text>In the art world, a biennale ( , ; ), is a large-scale international contemporary art exhibition. The term was popularised by the Venice Biennale, which was first held in 1895, but the concept of such a large scale, and intentionally international event goes back to at least the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. The 1990s saw the boom of art biennials, a period of multiplication of this exhibition form during which art biennials grew from approximately five to over 250 internationally.

Although typically used to refer to art festivals or exhibitions which occur every two years, the term is not always applied strictly. Since the 1990s, the terms &quot;biennale&quot; and &quot;biennial&quot; have both been used to refer to large-scale international survey shows of contemporary art that recur at regular intervals (Documenta is held every five years, and Skulptur Projekte Münster every ten). 

The term has also derived a suffix for other creative events, as in &quot;Berlinale&quot; for the Berlin International Film Festival and &quot;Viennale&quot; for the Vienna International Film Festival, both of which are actually held annually.

== Characteristics ==
According to author Federica Martini, what is at stake in contemporary biennales is the diplomatic and international relations potential as well as urban regeneration plans. Besides being mainly focused on the present (the &quot;here and now&quot; where the cultural event takes place and their effect of &quot;spectacularisation of the everyday&quot;), because of their site-specificity cultural events may refer back to, produce or frame the history of the site and communities&#x27; collective memory.
A strong and influent symbol of biennales and of large-scale international exhibitions in general is the Crystal Palace, the gigantic and futuristic London architecture that hosted the Great Exhibition in 1851. According to philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, the Crystal Palace is the first attempt to condense the representation of the world in a unitary exhibition space, where the main exhibit is society itself in an a-historical, spectacular condition. The Crystal Palace main motives were the affirmation of British economic and national leadership and the creation of moments of spectacle. In this respect, 19th century World fairs provided a visual crystallization of colonial culture and were, at the same time, forerunners of contemporary theme parks.

=== The Venice Biennale as an archetype ===

The Venice Biennale, a periodical large-scale cultural event founded in 1895, served as an archetype of the biennales. Meant to become a World Fair focused on contemporary art, the Venice Biennale used as a pretext the wedding anniversary of the Italian king and followed up to several national exhibitions organised after Italy unification in 1861. The Biennale immediately put forth issues of city marketing, cultural tourism and urban regeneration, as it was meant to reposition Venice on the international cultural map after the crisis due to the end of the Grand Tour model and the weakening of the Venetian school of painting. Furthermore, the Gardens where the Biennale takes place were an abandoned city area that needed to be re-functionalised. In cultural terms, the Biennale was meant to provide on a biennial basis a platform for discussing contemporary art practices that were not represented in fine arts museums at the time. The early Biennale model already included some key points that are still constitutive of large-scale international art exhibitions today: a mix of city marketing, internationalism, gentrification issues and destination culture, and the spectacular, large scale of the event.

=== Biennials after the 1990s ===
The situation of biennials has changed in the contemporary context: while at its origin in 1895 Venice was a unique cultural event, but since the 1990s hundreds of biennials have been organized across the globe. Given the ephemeral and irregular nature of some biennials, there is little consensus on the exact number of biennials in existence at any given time. Furthermore, while Venice was a unique agent in the presentation of contemporary art, since the 1960s several museums devoted to contemporary art are exhibiting the contemporary scene on a regular basis. Another point of difference concerns 19th century internationalism in the arts, that was brought into question by post-colonial debates and criticism of the contemporary art &quot;ethnic marketing&quot;, and also challenged the Venetian and World Fair&#x27;s national representation system. As a consequence of this, Eurocentric tendency to implode the whole word in an exhibition space, which characterises both the Crystal Palace and the Venice Biennale, is affected by the expansion of the artistic geographical map to scenes traditionally considered as marginal. The birth of the Havana Biennial in 1984 is widely considered an important counterpoint to the Venetian model for its prioritization of artists working in the Global South and curatorial rejection of the national pavilion model.

<text>Rob Younger (born Robert Kent Younger) is an Australian rock musician, vocalist, songwriter and producer. He is a founding mainstay of the punk rock group Radio Birdman, and he is a pioneer of the local independent music scene. Radio Birdman, formed with Deniz Tek on guitar in November 1974, was one of the first punk rock bands ever formed in Australia, and it is considered one of the most influential and crucial bands in Australian music history. Younger formed a short-term super-group, New Race, in 1981. He also formed New Christs in that year, who is still active today.

Younger undertook production work, particularly with bands on the Citadel Records label. He has teamed up with the label&#x27;s engineer-producer, Alan Thorne, and has worked independently in Australia and Europe. Younger and Radio Birdman are cited as influential by various rock artists, including The Hives and Silverchair. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007, Daniel Johns of Silverchair announced the induction of Radio Birdman into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

== Biography ==

Rob Younger was lead vocalist of the Rats in 1974 alongside Warwick Gilbert on guitar, Mick Lynne, Ron Keeley on drums and Carl Rourke on bass guitar. They played cover versions of material by New York Dolls, the Stooges, and Velvet Underground. Younger shared a house with fellow musician, Deniz Tek, who was a member of TV Jones. Younger, Keeley, Rourke and Tek on lead guitar formed a punk rock group, Radio Birdman, in Sydney in November 1974 with Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Hoyle on keyboards. Rourke was soon replaced on bass guitar by Gilbert. Fellow Australian musician, and some-time rock music journalist, Vince Lovegrove, observed, &quot;[they] turned the volume up full bore on their amplifiers, screamed out about revolution into the microphones, raised clenched fists in the air and in the process heralded in a brand new era for Australian rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll music.&quot;

The group&#x27;s debut four-track extended play, &quot;Burn My Eye&quot;, appeared in October 1976. It was followed by their debut studio album, &quot;Radios Appear&quot;, in July 1977. Younger co-wrote a track, &quot;Aloha Steve and Danno&quot;, for the international version, which appeared early in the following year. However, the group disbanded in June 1978. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, &quot;From the outset, [they] played an Americanised brand of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll that was totally honest and totally committed... Although generally loathed and shunned by the mainstream music industry of the day... [as] one of the most potent rock bands ever to emerge from Australia, [they] holds pride of place as THE cult band of the last 25 years. The band&#x27;s iconoclastic approach, uncompromising do-it-yourself ethos and outsider status in the face of overwhelming hostility remain the stuff of legend.&quot;

Younger formed the Other Side in 1978 with Clyde Bramley on bass guitar and Charlie Georgees on guitar (ex-the Hellcats). and Mark Kingsmill (also ex-the Hellcats) Ron Keeley replaced Kingsmill on drums. The group disbanded in the following year. In 1980 Younger was involved in production work on a four-track extended play, &quot;The Visitors&quot;, by local punk group of the same name – which included former band mates Hoyle, Keeley and Tek.

The New Christs were formed in 1980 as a hard rock group by Younger and Bramley (ex-the Hitmen) with Bruce &quot;Cub&quot; Callaway on guitar (X-Men, the Saints), John Hoey on keyboards (X-Men) and Don McGloneon on drums (Bedhogs). The line-up never performed live but released a single, &quot;Face a New God&quot; (1981), which was co-written by Younger and Callaway. McFarlane described it as &quot;searing acid-punk&quot; which has &quot;since emerged as one of the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk/new wave era.&quot; The group disbanded later that year.

Early in 1981 Younger, Gilbert and Tek formed a short-term punk super-group, New Race, with Ron Asheton (of the Stooges, Iggy Pop Band) on guitar, and Dennis &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Thompson (of MC5) on drums. They toured Australia&#x27;s east coast during April and May and recorded a live album, &quot;The First and Last&quot;, which was issued posthumously in the following year. It was co-produced by Younger with Charles Fisher and Alan Thorne. McFarlane felt it was &quot;one of the greatest live albums in the history of Australian rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll... hard&#x27;n&#x27;fast Detroit rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll at its very best, with Tek and Asheton&#x27;s incendiary guitar interplay well to the fore.&quot;

The New Christs reformed in June 1983 with Younger joined by Kingsmill, Chris Masuak on guitar and Tony Robertson on bass guitar (all from the Hitmen) and Kent Steedman on guitar (also in the Celibate Rifles). The group, according to AllMusic&#x27;s Geoff Ginsberg, &quot;have managed to persevere through many personnel changes, as well as Younger&#x27;s many commitments producing other bands.&quot; They issued five studio albums, &quot;Distemper&quot; (1989), &quot;Lower Yourself&quot; (1997), &quot;We Got This!&quot; (2002), &quot;Gloria&quot; (May 2009) and &quot;Incantations&quot; (2014).

Younger had teamed up with the Celibate Rifles on a live four-track EP, &quot;Rob Younger and the Celibate Rifles&quot; (1991), which was recorded in July 1988 at one of that group&#x27;s performances in Backnang, Germany. He had joined them on stage to provide vocals for cover versions of &quot;I-94&quot; (originally by Radio Birdman), &quot;She&#x27;s so Fine&quot; (The Easybeats), &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; (Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates) and &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; (AC/DC).

In April 1997 he was interviewed by Lovegrove: he described his recent work with New Christs and as a producer for other artists, &quot;Yeah, I haven&#x27;t done anything exceptionally odd, just work in studios, written songs and produced bands. I&#x27;ve got a family to support, a little girl aged 18 months and a four year old boy, so I&#x27;ve even had to work a few day jobs at various times. The band doesn&#x27;t have a big audience in Australia, so I&#x27;m champing at the bit to do this European tour. I think the lack of commitment on our part over the past few years hasn&#x27;t helped our Australian following, so we&#x27;ve had a real slump. But a band&#x27;s only as good as the songs that it writes, and we&#x27;ve got some good songs at the moment. We can rock, we know how to rock&quot;.

Younger has participated in reformations of Radio Birdman in 1996 and the following year; they reunited sporadically thereafter. In July 2007 the group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. They had refused an earlier nomination in the previous year but relented according to Shane Pinnegar, &quot;to pacify friends &amp; family who wanted to see them acknowledged for their contribution to Australian rock n’ roll.&quot; Younger reflected, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really want to accept [the Aria] because I didn&#x27;t think the music business was ever really on our side, but there were people that did help us out, whether they were journalists or the odd agent or whatever. But generally, of course, I was always on my high horse about what assholes most of the people in the music business were, but I was just scattering my antipathy around at the world really. I don&#x27;t know where it all fell, whether it landed on the right people or anything like that.&quot;

<text>Arnulf Rainer (born 8 December 1929) is an Austrian painter noted for his abstract informal art.

Rainer was born in Baden, Austria. During his early years, Rainer was influenced by Surrealism. In 1950, he founded the &quot;Hundsgruppe&quot; (&quot;dog group&quot;) together with Ernst Fuchs, Arik Brauer, and Josef Mikl. After 1954, Rainer&#x27;s style evolved towards &quot;Destruction of Forms&quot;, with blackenings, overpaintings, and maskings of illustrations and photographs dominating his later work. He was close to the &quot;Vienna Actionism&quot;, featuring body art and painting under the influence of drugs. He painted extensively on the subject of Hiroshima such as it relates to the nuclear bombing of the Japanese city and the inherent political and physical fallout.

In 1978, he received the Grand Austrian State Prize. In the same year, and in 1980, he became the Austrian representative at the Venice Biennale. From 1981 to 1995, Rainer held a professorship at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna - the same place where he aborted his own studies after three days, unsatisfied.

His works are shown in the Museum of Modern Art, the Arnulf Rainer Museum in Baden Austria and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. As the culmination of the appraisal of his work, the Arnulf Rainer Museum opened in New York City in 1993. His works have also continuously been shown at the European Cultural Centre&#x27;s palazzos in Venice during the Biennale since 2011. In the same year, he published the work &quot;Unfinished into Death&quot; () with the same organisation.

<doc id="700919" wikidata="Q3522001" url="?curid=700919" title="New Christs">
<text>The New Christs are an Australian garage rock band formed in 1980 by founding mainstay, Rob Younger, on lead vocals. Younger was the lead singer for punk rockers, Radio Birdman, and in other hard rock groups, New Race, Bad Music, the Other Side, Nanker Phelge, and Deep Reduction. The New Christs line-up since 2011 is Younger with Jim Dickson on bass guitar, Dave Kettley on guitar, Paul Larsen on drums and Brent Williams on guitar and keyboards. Over their career the group have issued five studio albums, &quot;Distemper&quot; (1989), &quot;Lower Yourself&quot; (1997), &quot;We Got This!&quot; (2002), &quot;Gloria&quot; (2009) and &quot;Incantations&quot; (2014). Three former members have died: Stevie Plunder in January 1996, Mark Wilkinson in December 2012 and Christian Houllemare in June 2014.

==1980–1981==

The New Christs were formed early in 1980 in Sydney as a hard rock group with Clyde Bramley on bass guitar (ex-The Hitmen, Other Side), Bruce &#x27;Cub&#x27; Callaway on guitar (ex-X-Men, Saints), John Hoey on keyboards (ex-X-Men), Don McGloneon on drums (ex-Bedhogs) and Rob Younger on lead vocals (ex-Radio Birdman, Other Side). This line up never performed live but they released a single, &quot;Face a New God&quot;, in August 1981, which was produced by Callaway for Green Records. The track was co-written by Callaway and Younger. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as &quot;searing acid-punk&quot; which has &quot;since emerged as one of the most collectable artefacts of the Australian punk/new wave era.&quot; They disbanded later that year.

==1983–1984==

The New Christs reformed in June 1983 with Younger joined by Chris Masuak on guitar, Mark Kingsmill on drums and Tony Robertson on bass guitar (all from The Hitmen) and Kent Steedman on guitar (also in the Celibate Rifles). They supported an Australian tour by Iggy Pop and then Steedman returned to the Celibate Rifles. Younger kept the band going with Richard Jakimyszyn as a replacement on guitar (ex-Lime Spiders). They issued two singles, &quot;Like a Curse&quot; (April 1984) and &quot;Born out of Time&quot; (April 1986), on Citadel Records, which were written and produced by Younger. McFarlane felt they were &quot;consummate, guitar-driven, hard rock&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Jack Rabid reviewed &quot;Like a Curse&quot;, as being &quot;more slam-bang rock with great rhythm from a man who has it coursing in his bones.&quot; The group&#x27;s music was used on the soundtrack of the feature film, &quot;Going Down&quot; (1982). This line-up broke up in May 1984.

==1987–1990, 1991==

Another version of the New Christs were assembled in February 1987: with Younger were Louis Burdett on drums (ex-Powerhouse, Ed Kuepper Band), Jim Dickson on bass guitar (ex-Railroad Gin, Survivors, Passengers, Barracudas) and Charlie Owen on lead guitar (ex-Tango Bravo). Burdett was soon replaced on drums by Nick Fisher (ex-Wet Taxis, Paris Green). This line up released four singles, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (July 1987), &quot;Dropping Like Flies&#x27;&quot; (December), &quot;Headin&#x27; South&quot; (November 1988) and &quot;Another Sin&quot; (June 1989). A four-track extended play, &quot;Detritus&quot;, was issued as a compilation in 1987 for the United Kingdom and United States markets. It was followed in 1988 by an Australian compilation album, &quot;Divine Rites&quot;, which collected five singles from Citadel Records.

The group&#x27;s first studio album appeared in August 1989, &quot;Distemper&quot;, which McFarlane opined was &quot;explosive&quot; and &quot;remains the definitive statement on the band&#x27;s sound and style. It contained a wealth of powerful tracks.&quot; Penelope Layland of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; declared it to be &quot;good, aggressive music, full of hate, even if it has all been done before... All in all a good album. Play it as a substitute for clobbering someone.&quot; In June 2008 Dylan Lewis described it as &quot;A non-stop ride of terrific songs full of melody and power offset the bleak, venomous lyrics. The tension the musicians create in each track is spine tingling. It&#x27;s an exhausting album to listen to. To my ears, it stands as the greatest, raging Australian rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll album.&quot; It reached No. 1 on the ARIA Alternative Albums Chart. They toured Australia and undertook two tours of Europe (1988, 1989). The band split up in February 1990 but briefly reformed in 1991 to support Ramones at a gig in Sydney.

==1992–2001==

Younger established the next version of New Christs in January 1992 with Billy Gibson on guitar and organ (ex-Eastern Dark), Greg Hitchcock on guitar (ex-The Neptunes, Kryptonics), Christian Houllemare on bass guitar (ex-Happy Hate Me Nots), Peter Kelly on drums (ex-Flies, No Man&#x27;s Land, Vanilla Chainsaws) and Stevie Plunder on guitar (ex-The Plunderers). Hitchcock soon left to join the Boom Babies and, in September 1992, Plunder formed the Whitlams and was replaced by Tony Harper (ex-Viscounts, Voodoo Lust). Another four-track EP, &quot;Pedestal&quot;, was released in October 1994. In 1995 Mark Wilkinson (ex-Girlies, Lime Spiders) replaced Gibson on piano and guitar. Younger, Harper, Houllemare, Kelly and Wilkinson line-up were recorded on a seven-track EP, &quot;Woe Betide&quot; (November 1995), which was produced by Younger. A Canadian label, Lance Rock Records, issued a compilation album, &quot;Born out of Time&quot; (1996), which McFarlane described as &quot;13 tracks of prime New Christs aural mayhem.&quot; Younger felt it contained &quot;the songs I can still stand.&quot;

The New Christs were temporarily put on hold in early 1996 while Younger toured with a reformed, Radio Birdman. The New Christs resumed by mid-year and released their second studio album, &quot;Lower Yourself&quot; (early 1997), produced by Younger. Lauren Zoric of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained that it is &quot;Propelled by tough, inventive riffs and glorious rock &amp; roll grooves, occasional keyboards now infiltrate the make up. Harnessing and driving the band&#x27;s considerable power, Younger is ever on the brink of immolation, expressing a diseased soul, wracked by the compromises and humiliations of love. Long may we revel in his purgatory.&quot; An extended version included a bonus four-track EP. The group toured Australia and then, in April 1997, Europe with Al Creed on guitar and vocals (ex-Fruitworld, Hey Charger!), who replaced Harper.

They disbanded in 2001 and posthumously released a 2× CD studio album, &quot;We Got This!&quot;, in 2002, which was produced by Wayne Connolly. Online webzine, &quot;Oz Music Project&quot;″s Pants noticed that &quot;The crux of this album though is the incredible vibrancy and individuality of the songs, each track rocking hard but having its own identity and personality, yet amazingly intertwining such emotion into each track.&quot; I-94 Bar&#x27;s Simon Li felt that &quot;Younger is in some of his best vocal form on this CDLP, as the band responds the best way they can; solid and continually menacing.&quot; Fellow reviewer John McPharlin notice &quot;there is a remarkable consistency of vision, intent and achievement across the whole album. Not for a single moment on any of these tracks does this sound like a band that had run its race, dropped the ball, hit bottom, lost the plot, shot its load and/or was about to tear itself apart.&quot; Ahead of its appearance Younger declared that it would be the last album from his group.

Also in 2002, Citadel Records issued another compilation album, &quot;These Rags&quot;, using remixed versions of two earlier EPs, &quot;Pedestal&quot; and &quot;Woe Betide&quot;. Three members of the 1990s line-up have died: Stevie Plunder in January 1996, Mark Wilkinson in December 2012 and Christian Houllemare in June 2014.

==2006–present==

In May 2006 Younger displayed another New Christs line-up: Jim Dickson on bass guitar, Dave Kettley on guitar (Shifter, The Dead Set, Radio Birdman), Brent Williams on guitar and keyboards, and Stu Wilson on drums. The Barman of I-94 Bar website caught their gig in May in Wollongong, where they played &quot;a Greatest Hits package with none of the new songs from the Younger canon... A solid hit-out by a new line-up with versatility and style... Europe&#x27;s going to be in for a fine old time.&quot; In May and June that year the group performed in Spain – including at the Primavera Sound in Barcelona, an eclectic annual festival specialised in independent music – France, Germany and Belgium. They subsequently toured Europe four more times (2008, 2009, 2011, 2014). In January 2008 Younger told Patrick of Mess+Noise website that he disputes providing a lasting legacy, &quot;I think much of that [perceived influence] is born of hindsight... Sure, we had some degree of influence because so many people have told me over the years they started their group after hearing us. That’s how I got started, hearing other groups, except it was via the records of the New York Dolls and the Stooges, because the local groups were so vapid rather than inspiring.&quot;

The group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Gloria&quot;, was released in May 2009. Jeff Glorfeld of &quot;The Age&quot; rated it at three out of five. The Barman described it as &quot;the most low key-sounding New Christs album in the canon. Production was an exercise in economic rationalism – live crowds are small and labels with cash to burn are thin on the ground – and much of what resulted from an earlier session was scrapped.&quot; In that same year they played at the Azkena Rock Festival in Spain.

In 2011 Wilson was replaced by Paul Larsen (also with The Celibate Rifles). Dominique Genot of I-94 Bar reviewed the group&#x27;s live album, &quot;Live 2011&quot;, which is &quot;[as] live as you hope to see them (and I did during the 2011 Euro tour). The record was done at the Excelsior Hotel&#x27;s closing night in Sydney in May, and the thing was quickly mixed by guitarist-keyboardist Brent Williams. The album&#x27;s got a big sound, with Dave Kettley&#x27;s guitar high in the ears. My personal criticisms is that Rob Younger&#x27;s voice is too low in the mix - also i think there are a few cuts between the songs.&quot;

This line-up issued their sixth studio album, &quot;Incantations&quot;, in June 2014. Gus Ironside of &quot;Louder Than War&quot; rated it as 9 out of 10 and felt it was &quot;a highly melodic album, packed with hooks and insidious tunes, it&#x27;s a tightly-coiled brute, as claustrophobically dense with detail as it is outright rocking.&quot;

Granovetter has been the Joan Butler Ford Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford since at least 2005, and has chaired of the Department of Sociology twice. In 2020, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He previously worked at Northwestern University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Johns Hopkins University.

===The strength of weak ties===

Granovetter&#x27;s paper &quot;The Strength of Weak Ties&quot; is one of the most influential articles in social science, with over 60,000 citations according to Google Scholar (). Its thesis is that weak ties—acquaintanceships that are not reinforced by many mutual friendships—are especially pivotal in the flow of information. It has become a core idea in the field of social networks. In marketing, information science, or politics, weak ties enable reaching populations and audiences that are not accessible via strong ties. The concepts and findings of this work were later published in the monograph &quot;Getting A Job&quot;, an adaptation of Granovetter&#x27;s doctoral dissertation at Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Social Relations, with the title: &quot;Changing Jobs: Channels of Mobility Information in a Suburban Population&quot; (313 pages).

In 1969 Granovetter submitted this paper to &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;, but it was rejected. Eventually this pioneering research was published in 1973 in American Journal of Sociology and became the most cited work in the social sciences.

===Economic sociology: Embeddedness===
In the field of economic sociology, Granovetter has been a leader since the publication in 1985 of an article that launched &quot;new economic sociology&quot;, &quot;Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness&quot;. This article caused Granovetter to be identified with the concept of &quot;embeddedness&quot;, the idea that economic relations between individuals or firms are embedded in actual social networks and do not exist in an abstract idealized market. The concept of embeddedness originated with Karl Polanyi in his book &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;, where Polanyi posited that all economies are embedded in social relations and institutions. Granovetter also published a book called &quot;Society and Economy&quot; (2017).

===&quot;Tipping points&quot; and threshold models===
Granovetter has done research on a model of how fads are created. Consider a hypothetical mob assuming that each person&#x27;s decision whether to riot or not is dependent on what everyone else is doing. Instigators will begin rioting even if no one else is, while others need to see a critical number of trouble makers before they riot, too. This threshold is assumed to be distributed to some probability distribution. The outcomes may diverge largely although the initial condition of threshold may only differ very slightly. This threshold model of social behavior was proposed previously by Thomas Schelling and later popularized by Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;.

===Security influence===
Granovetter&#x27;s work has influenced researchers in capability-based security. Interactions in these systems can be described using &quot;Granovetter diagrams&quot;, which illustrate changes in the ties between objects.

<text>In commercial aviation, a red-eye flight refers to a flight that departs at night and arrives the next morning, especially when the total flight time is insufficient for passengers to get a full night&#x27;s sleep.

The term derives from red eyes as a symptom of fatigue.

== Causes and utilities ==
For the airline, overnight flights enable more use of aircraft that would otherwise stand idle. For airports, it may be rational to divert the stream of passengers away from peak hours. In major airports, the capacity for flight operations during daytime may be fully exhausted, and the price of airport slots may be higher at peak hours.

For passengers, the benefits and disadvantages are more subjective. While overnight flights are often less costly, many will perceive it difficult to arrive well-rested after a night flight, especially if it is at odd hours or too short to fit into a full night&#x27;s sleep. However, the traffic to and from the airport, as well as the airport experience, may be less stressful at these hours. Some passengers may want to arrive early in a city and return the same day, saving on a night&#x27;s accommodation, or enjoy one full day at the beginning or end of the trip. It has been claimed that red-eye flights are popular among business travelers who benefit from flying at night. Business class seats are often reclinable to a flat position, enabling normal sleep.

== Examples ==
One definition of a red-eye flight is one that is too short to allow a full night&#x27;s sleep. An example would be those flights from Los Angeles to New York City—about five hours&#x27; flying time—that depart between 2100 and 0100 Pacific time, and arrive between 0500 and 0900 Eastern time.

=== Asia ===
*Japan Airlines used to operate red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda, but it has switched to daytime flights. Taipei/Hong Kong to Japan is also a typical red eye, with flights departing between 1 and 2 am and arriving between 6 and 7 am. Cathay Pacific still operates one flight each to Tokyo Narita and Osaka, while All Nippon Airways operates red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Tokyo&#x27;s Haneda daily.
*Asiana, Korean Air, and Cathay Pacific operate red-eye flights from Hong Kong to Seoul. Asiana operates flights to Busan. Cathay Pacific used to fly a red-eye flight from Seoul to Hong Kong, but the flight is now suspended and the airline operates only daytime and evening flights from Seoul to Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific also used to fly a red-eye flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur, but it changed this to an evening flight, complementing its morning and afternoon flights.
*Cathay Pacific operates many red-eye flights outside of Tokyo and Seoul. These include red-eye flights between Hong Kong and cities in Australia and New Zealand in both directions, as well as between Hong Kong and Singapore. Cathay Pacific flights that are red-eye only in the Hong Kong-bound direction include those from Bangkok. Cathay Pacific flights that are red-eye only from Hong Kong include those to Seoul and parts of Japan. Except for a few London bound departures, all of Cathay Pacific’s flights to Europe depart around midnight and arrive at their destinations at 6-8 am, with many other carriers implementing a similar schedule for flights bound for Europe and the Middle East from East Asian cities.
*Flights that leave India and Southwest Asia around midnight arrive in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore early morning. 
*Philippine Airlines also operates red-eye flights from Korea and Japan back to Manila, which also have regular late-night flights from Manila to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. 
*Many flights from Southeast Asia to Japan, Korea, and China depart in the evenings or around midnight, and land at the destinations in the early morning. There are also flights that depart Japan, Korea, or China around midnight, and arrive in Southeast Asia in the early morning.
*Indonesian airlines operate overnight red-eye flights from Jakarta to the easternmost province of Papua. With a flight time of four to five hours and a two-hour time difference, most red-eye flights depart shortly before midnight and arrive around 6am. Garuda Indonesia also operates daily overnight flights to the East Asia&#x27;s Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing, leaving Jakarta at midnight and arriving at around 6am the next morning. Garuda Indonesia applies a similar daily overnight flight schedule for its Australia-bound flight routes, departing from Jakarta and Denpasar just before midnight and arriving in Sydney and Melbourne at around 9am the next morning.
*Pakistan International Airlines flies red-eye flights to Lahore, Pakistan from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as well as flights from Manchester, Birmingham and London to Pakistan.
*Turkish Airlines flies red-eye flights to Istanbul, Turkey from Malé, Maldives.
*Singapore Airlines flies red-eye flights to Singapore from Malé, Maldives.
*Gulf Air flies red-eye flights from Bahrain to Malé, Maldives.
*El Al flies red-eye flights to many Western European destinations, as well as London–Heathrow and London–Luton.
*Former U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines used to fly from Tokyo–Narita to other regional Asian destinations such as Seoul–Incheon, Busan, Beijing–Capital, Shanghai–Pudong, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, Hong Kong, Taipei–Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi, Kuala Lumpur–International, and Singapore, with flights departing Tokyo between 5pm and 7pm, and arriving at other Far East destinations between 8pm and midnight.

From Taipei to the west coast of the US, EVA Air flies red eyes leaving at 10 am or 10 pm and arriving at 7 am or 7 pm the same day.

=== Australia ===
The majority of transcontinental flights are operated during the day, but as of 2010, red-eye flights operate from Perth to Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra and Melbourne, and from Darwin to Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Red-eye flights have previously operated from Australia to New Zealand and Fiji.

Red-eye flights to Australia operate from various locations in Southeast Asia and North America, such as Scoot&#x27;s flights from Singapore to Gold Coast, Sydney, and Melbourne. Jetstar offers red-eye flights between Melbourne and Wellington with the flight departing Melbourne at 1am and arriving in Wellington at 6am.

Another example would be Qantas flights from Los Angeles to Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, and flights from Dallas to Sydney), generally leaving 10pm to 11pm and arriving from 5am to 8am. While they do fly during the night - this is more a product of large time zone differences - the flights take around 15 hours (giving more time to sleep) and westward flight stretches out the local length of day and night. Furthermore, as the flight crosses the International Date Line, flights arrive roughly two days later in local time.

=== Latin America ===
LATAM Brasil, Azul Brazilian Airlines and Gol Transportes Aéreos all offer red-eye flights in Brazil, popularly known as &quot;Big Owl,&quot; after a late-night film session broadcast by Rede Globo (), with over 50 different routes throughout Brazil, all departing between 10pm and 6am. Usually these flights originate in Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, or São Paulo and are bound for Manaus, Belém, Porto Velho, Northeast Brazil, North America, Argentina, and Europe.

Another example is Copa Airlines, which operates several red-eye flights to Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and several other destinations within Latin America.

=== Europe ===
Red-eye flights to Europe were once meant to apply exclusively to the morning arrivals of transatlantic flights from the American East Coast to Western Europe. Such traffic now comprises the busiest of the long-haul air routes. The first of these flights, from the busiest destinations of New York and Washington D.C., will arrive at the major European airports at London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin between 0500 and 1200 local time (and when still subject to costly night-flying restrictions); and hence in increasing numbers and to and from a wide range of American/European destinations.

Travelling from Europe, red-eye flights are scheduled out of Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, and Frankfurt. The flight time is of three to five hours, with typical departure around midnight, and arrival around dawn the next day. Most airlines from the Middle East and Asia operate red-eye services from major Western European destinations. One example is London Heathrow, where the last departures - leaving between 22.30 and 23.00 - are eastbound medium-haul services to destinations such as Tel Aviv. Also, long-haul services depart Europe and arrive in Asia at practically the same time the next day (For example, leaving London at 2 pm and arriving at Hong Kong at 12 pm the next day.)

=== Russia ===
Russian airlines operate similarly to U.S. airlines by connecting Moscow to Yakutsk, Irkutsk, and Vladivostok. They last five to eight hours but due to the northerly latitude the flights can cross as many as eight time zones during this interval, drastically enlarging the time difference. The flights depart Moscow around 6pm and arrive at the eastern cities around 6am the next day. One of the current examples of red-eye flight is Aeroflot&#x27;s SU783 from Moscow to Magadan, departing 11:05pm Moscow time and arriving 2:00pm Vladivostok Time on the next day, with a flight time of approximately eight hours.

=== South Africa ===
Many medium and long-haul flights to/from South Africa and Europe, other African destinations and the Middle East make use of red-eye flights and longitudinal advantages (similar time zones) so that passengers can arrive at their destinations early in the morning and benefit from minimal time zone changes due to South Africa&#x27;s geographic position. This makes it an efficient and convenient way to travel between each area.

=== United States and Canada ===
Red-eye flights frequently connect West Coast cities to East Coast cities. These typically depart the West Coast between 9pm and 1am, and have a flight time of three to six hours but gain between two and four hours due to the time difference, arriving on the East Coast between 5am and 9am. American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, JetBlue, and other U.S. and Canadian carriers operate red-eye flights that depart from the West Coast at night from cities such as Los Angeles, Vancouver, Calgary, San Francisco, and Seattle, among others, arriving in Boston, New York, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and other East Coast cities in the morning. Red-eye flights also connect Hawaii or Alaska with West Coast mainland cities, departing from Honolulu between 10pm and midnight or Anchorage between midnight and 3am and arriving in Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Seattle between 5am and 7am. Flights from Tokyo to Honolulu are considered red-eye flights, as the flights are usually overnight flights that are six to seven hours.

From the US, there are flights departing between midnight and 2am, headed towards East Asian destinations such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong and arriving between 5am and 7am.

== In popular culture ==
Films involving red-eye flights include &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), &quot;The Langoliers&quot; (1995), &quot;Turbulence&quot; (1997), &quot;Red Eye&quot; (2005), &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; (2006), and &quot;Non-Stop&quot; (2014).

The 2020 TV series &quot;Into the Night&quot; includes a red-eye flight in its central premise.

<doc id="700951" wikidata="Q363430" url="?curid=700951" title="Nicolai Ghiaurov">
<text>Nicolai Ghiaurov (or &quot;Nikolai Gjaurov&quot;, &quot;Nikolay Gyaurov&quot;, ; September 13, 1929 – June 2, 2004) was a Bulgarian opera singer and one of the most famous basses of the postwar period. He was admired for his powerful, sumptuous voice, and was particularly associated with roles of Mussorgsky and Verdi. Ghiaurov married the Bulgarian pianist Zlatina Mishakova in 1956 and Italian soprano Mirella Freni in 1978, and the two singers frequently performed together. They lived in Modena until Ghiaurov&#x27;s death in 2004 of a heart attack.

==Biography==
Ghiaurov was born in the small mountain town of Velingrad in southern Bulgaria. As a child, he learned to play the violin, piano and clarinet. He began his musical studies at the Bulgarian State Conservatory in 1949 where he studied under Prof. Cristo Brambarov. Ghiaurov was awarded a state scholarship and from 1950 until 1955 he studied at the Moscow Conservatory.

Ghiaurov&#x27;s career was launched in 1955, when he won the Grand Prix at the International Vocal Competition in Paris and the First Prize and a gold medal at the Fifth World Youth Festival in Warsaw. Ghiaurov made his operatic debut in 1955 as Don Basilio in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; in Sofia. In 1956 he moved to the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, singing his first Mephistopheles. He made his Italian operatic debut in 1958 in Teatro Comunale Bologna, before starting an international career with his rendition of Varlaam in the opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; at La Scala in 1959. 1962 marked Ghiaurov&#x27;s Covent Garden debut as Padre Guardiano in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot; as well as his first appearance in Salzburg in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, conducted by Herbert von Karajan.

Ghiaurov first shared a stage with Mirella Freni in 1961 in Genoa. She was Marguerite, he was Mephistopheles in &quot;Faust&quot;. Married in 1978, they lived in her hometown, Modena. They sang together frequently.

He made his US debut in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in 1963 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and he went on to sing twelve roles with the company, including the title roles in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;, and &quot;Mefistofele&quot;.

Ghiaurov made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 8 November 1965 as Mefistofele. He sang a total of 81 performances in ten roles there, last appearing there on October 26, 1996, as Sparafucile in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;. During the course of his career, he also performed at Moscow&#x27;s Bolshoi Theatre, the Vienna State Opera, Covent Garden, and Paris Opéra.

In the late 1970s Ghiaurov sang the title role in the first complete stereo recording of Massenet&#x27;s opera &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;. He was recorded frequently, and his discography includes complete recordings of many of his great stage roles, including Don Giovanni, Don Basilio, Ramfis, Colline, Banco, Gounod&#x27;s and Boito&#x27;s Mephistos and Boris Godunov, among many others.

Ghiaurov and his wife Mirella Freni sang together in many operas, more notable ones being &quot;Simon Boccanegra (La Scala, 1971), Faust (Covent Garden, 1976), Don Carlos (Salzburg, 1976), Ernani (La Scala, 1982).&quot;

In October 2000, at the age of 71, he gave an acclaimed performance at the 1st Herbert von Karajan Memorial concert under the baton of James Allen Gähres in Ulm, where he sang opera arias and duets by Cilea, Tchaikovsky and Verdi, together with Mirella Freni.

In Ghiaurov&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Opera News&quot;, Martin Bernheimer remarked: &quot;He commanded a remarkable vocal instrument, strikingly generous in size, warm in timbre, dark in color. He rolled out the resonant tone at his command with generosity, and with special ease at the burnished top.&quot;

<doc id="700953" wikidata="Q15647197" url="?curid=700953" title="Thigh-high boots">
<text>Thigh-high boots, known also as thigh-length boots or simply thigh boots, are boots that extend above the knees to at least mid-thigh. Other terms for this footwear include &quot;over-the-knee boots&quot;, a name originally used for 15th century riding boots for men. These are sometimes called &quot;pirate boots&quot;, especially when cuffed. Over-the-knee boots are sometimes abbreviated to OTK boots. Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as &quot;crotch boots&quot; or &quot;crotch-high boots&quot;).

Thigh boots are made of materials such as leather, synthetic materials (including vinyl and sheet latex) or fabrics (including silk and polyester microfiber). Many are constructed with zippers, but some are designed as pull-on boots. Heel heights vary, but most styles are either flat or have high heels greater than . Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can also have platform soles.

Thigh boots are considered by many to be erotic or kinky. They are used as fetish clothing in boot fetishism and shoe fetishism and also as part of leather fetishism and rubber and PVC fetishism. Cheaper thigh boots are often worn by female models, prostitutes and dominatrices, so many people consider them icons of such trades. Because of the latter, they are often associated with sadomasochism. Nevertheless, they are frequently sold by couture designers, perhaps because of the implied eroticism. Thigh-high boots are considered by many a symbol of women&#x27;s power, authority and sex appeal.

The visual appearance of thigh-high boots depends on the length of the legs. Samantha Clark, in her book Outfits in Minutes, writes: &quot;The shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you.&quot;

==History==
===Late Victorian era===

Laced leather boots were fashionable throughout the Victorian era for women. By the end of the 19th century, over-the-knee length laced leather boots were becoming a trend among London prostitutes wanting a style that would appeal to foot fetishists and clients interested in finding a dominatrix.

===1960s===
Kinky boots, also referred to as fetish boots, are boots made typically with patent leather and high stiletto heels. Their extreme characteristics intended to present a dramatic sexy appearance, such as by a prostitute or dominatrix. Characteristics often include very high heels, thigh- or crotch-high length, or unusual colors or materials.

Boots of this type, and specifically the thigh-high leather boots worn by Honor Blackman in her role as Cathy Gale in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, are referred to in the 1964 song &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; by Blackman and her &quot;Avengers&quot; co-star Patrick Macnee.

==In fashion==

In women&#x27;s fashion, thigh boots run through cycles in both popularity and design. As referenced by several authors, the popularity of the motion picture &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; hurt the credibility of thigh boots as wardrobe staples. Nevertheless, in any fall fashion season, one or more designers and retailers will take a chance on their appeal.

Like shoes in general, fashion thigh boots are marketed through several different channels. A key differentiator among these channels is the price point and construction:
* Couture fashion designers
* Fashion designers
* Couture shoe designers
* Boutique brands
* Fashion and shoe retailers

Couture fashion designers marketing thigh boots will vary from year to year. Introducing a boot model is typically tied to the designer&#x27;s theme for the line. These boots will typically be marketed at the highest price point for thigh boots and, usually, for shoes in general. Fashion designers market similarly, though at a lower price point.

A number of couture shoe design houses regularly include thigh boots in their collections, and the price point will be at a premium, just as with the couture fashion designers. Examples of these designers are:
* Brian Atwood
* Manolo Blahnik
* Jimmy Choo
* Christian Louboutin
* Sergio Rossi (of Gucci Group)
* Stuart Weitzman
* Giuseppe Zanotti (of Vicini S.p.A.)

Couture fashion designers regularly use the shoe design houses to design the boots and shoes for their collections.

Thigh boots are a regular staple of several Italian boutique brands, including:
* Gianmarco Lorenzi
* Left and Right
* Le Silla
* Loriblu
* Icône

The price point for these boots can be very high, particularly at retail boutiques, but will vary more than for couture designers. Some brands are available through eBay sellers and clearance sellers at discounted prices. The lowest price tier is typically the fashion retailers. Retailers who regularly market thigh boots in their line include:
* Aldo
* bebe
* Victoria&#x27;s Secret

===Autumn 2010===
In Autumn 2010, thigh-high boots repeated as a fashion highlight from Autumn 2009. Designers and fashion houses who showed them with their designs included:
* Burberry Prorsum
* Christian Dior
* Hermès
* Vionnet

===Autumn 2009===
The Autumn 2009 fashion season featured thigh-high boots as a key fashion accessory for the season, resulting in the style being declared a fashion trend in early 2009. Reaching a wider audience through fashion magazine editorials, the footwear style was shown in two different feature layouts in the September 2009 issue of US &quot;Vogue&quot;. Numerous high street fashion stores featured thigh-high boots in their Autumn 2009 collections, with many fashion designers also featuring them in their ready-to-wear collections.

Miuccia Prada pushed the margins of fashion with her thigh boots designed for fashion. One version even featured garters to suspend the tops from a belt. Right behind her was Stella McCartney, featuring three crotch-length boots with synthetic uppers, in following with her usual animal-friendly practice. All three had snipped toes and extreme stiletto heels, and one featured a multi-patterned, pierced upper.

Other design houses showing thigh boots in their Autumn 2009 lines included:
* Alexander McQueen
* Catherine Malandrino
* Celine
* Chloé
* Gucci
* Halston
* Louis Vuitton

As for the couture shoe designers, Christian Louboutin marketed no less than four different styles in Autumn 2009 – a front-lacing mid-thigh length with sculpted heel and hidden platform (Supra Fifré), a crotch-length, skin-tight boot with hidden platform, a chunky mid-thigh boot (Contente), and a chunky platform mid-thigh boot. In addition to one heeled thigh boot featuring an elastic cuff just above the knee and two pairs of flat over-the-knee boots in their couture line, Jimmy Choo&#x27;s limited edition capsule collection for H&amp;M featured a mid-thigh black leather boot with a four-inch heel.

===Spring 2009===
Givenchy kicked off the thigh boot trend conspicuously out of season in early 2009 with a western-style thigh boot in black leather.

===Autumn 2008===
Fendi supported the thigh boot cause in Autumn 2008 with a chunky suede boot that featured a metallic leather accent around the ankle of the boot and at the top of the heel. The boot was carried by several different retail outlets and was available in black, brown, taupe, and gray.

===Autumn 2006===
Karl Lagerfeld styled all of his designs in the Autumn 2006 Chanel collection with thigh boots. The boots were finished in a variety of materials, including black suede and different shades of blue denim.

===Autumn 2005===
Karl Lagerfeld showed the Chanel black leather thigh boot with many of his Autumn 2005 designs that actress Anne Hathaway later wore in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, which made her a fashion icon.

===Autumn 2003===
Narciso Rodriguez created a stir in Autumn 2003 when almost half the models in his ready-to-wear show were wearing thigh boots with his clothing line. The boots featured four-inch heels and pointed toes. Phoebe Philo at Chloé showed leather and suede thigh boots in several colors, including red and green, in addition to the more typical black and brown.

===Autumn 2001===
Roberto Cavalli showed many of his designs in Autumn 2001 with thigh boots. The boots featured four-inch heels and pointed toes.

== Thigh-high boots in contemporary media ==
Thigh-high boots have been worn by many celebrities in recent years. Ariana Grande has incorporated many styles of thigh-high boots into her signature look. Because of this many articles were published advertising thigh-high boots, resulting in a surge of demand for the item. This could also be linked to the fact that the years of 2018–2019 saw a trend of popular 90s trends becoming fashionable again.

==Fetish==


Thigh boots as articles of fetish clothing date back to at least the 1950s when Irving Klaw used them in the costuming of the women in his erotic photography. Since that time, they have been a staple of fetish and adult photography. For instance, Bob Guccione photographed the 1982 &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year, Corinne Alphen, in a pair of black leather thigh boots for her feature layout. Similarly, Dwight Hooker photographed the &quot;Playboy&quot; 25th Anniversary Playmate, Candy Loving, in white leather over-the-knee boots for her layout.

Until the 2000s, fetish thigh boots were generally distinguished from fashion boots by being more extreme in many design dimensions, particularly heel height and platform height. In the late 2000s, this trend slowly changed as some couture designers, particularly Christian Louboutin, experimented with more extreme designs in their shoes. Consequently, the difference between the two now is more a function of the materials used. In particular, fetish thigh boots tend to be constructed of polyurethane (PU) or vinyl (often incorrectly referred to as patent leather). In addition, they are generally produced in China and sold at low cost. Some European cobblers have specialized in higher-priced thigh boots for the fetish market.

==Iconography and symbolism in motion pictures==
Motion pictures in which thigh boots were prominent in an actress&#x27; wardrobe include:
* In the 1990 film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, the protagonist, Vivian Ward (played by Julia Roberts), wears her black vinyl thigh boots throughout much of the first part of the movie as a symbol of her role as a prostitute.
* In the 2006 film &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, the protagonist, Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), completes her ugly-duckling-to-swan transformation by strutting confidently into her employer&#x27;s offices wearing a pair of Chanel black leather thigh boots. Andy&#x27;s wardrobe for this scene and the rest of the movie was styled by noted costumer, stylist, and designer Patricia Field.
* In the live-action films 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, Glenn Close (Cruella) wears thigh high red PVC and thigh / crotch high black PVC boots respectively. Her boots end up stained in molasses and mud.

<text>Cradle is a 1988 science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. The main premise of the novel is the contact between a few humans from the Miami area in 1994 and the super robots of a damaged space ship submerged off the Florida coast. Telecommunication advances such as videotelephones and highly efficient underwater scanning equipment used in the story bridge from the everyday, real-life aspects of the setting toward the near future, bespeaking technological progress.

== Plot summary ==

In 1994, the US Navy is testing a new missile, but after the launch it mysteriously disappears and it is clear that if the rocket reaches civilian areas they will be in big trouble. Carol Dawson, a journalist, is alerted by an unusual sight of whales in the Miami area, and decides to go and write about it.

Armed with special equipment provided by her friend, Dr. Dale Michaels from MOI (Miami Oceanographic Institute), goes to investigate the rumors of a missing missile belonging to the Marines and that could be behind the mysterious whale behavior lately. She hires the services of Nick Williams and Jefferson Troy, owners of a little boat so she can get to the Gulf of Mexico and investigate closer if a missile has something to do with all of the above.

They end up finding an unknown artifact, bringing a lot of doubts about its nature, and even if it is part of a lost treasure that could be worth millions. Old friends of Williams and Troy noticed the finding and just like the old times, they want to steal it from them.

In the background of the story, the author talks about a submarine snake civilization on a planet called Canthor, and how they were struggling to stay alive due to new threats into their ecosystem. It is revealed later in the story that the artifact found in the sea is actually a cradle that contains seeds with altered superhumans, which were extracted from Earth millions of years ago and were altered so they could live with other species (including the submarine snakes) on Earth. The spaceship that carries the cradle is crewed by robots/cyborgs and has hidden itself on Earth&#x27;s ocean floor to make repairs.

Dawson, Williams and Troy found the damaged ship in the bottom of the sea while looking for the missile, and were asked to gather materials so the ship can be repaired and it could go back to its mission. Before leaving earth, the ship asked the humans to keep the cradle because it would enormously help the human race to have such superhuman seeds to develop faster and better through time, but in the end the humans refuse in order to avoid future wars between the human and superhumans.

== Critical response ==
The book has been criticized for excessive descriptions of the characters&#x27; personal lives unrelated to the plot and its numerous sex scenes. In one critic&#x27;s words:

:&quot;I’m all for character development and, if it’s pertinent to future events, I don’t really mind if it drags a little. But the first few hundred pages of Cradle are filled with more-or-less pointless character development, clearly written by Lee, that would be perfectly at home in a &quot;Harlequin&quot; romance novel. A few pages of sci-fi, clearly not written by Lee, are interspersed so that the reader may be reminded that they paid $6 for a Clarke novel and not $2 for a grocery store romance tome.&quot;

<text>Ribet&#x27;s theorem (earlier called the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture) is part of number theory. It concerns properties of Galois representations associated with modular forms. It was proposed by Jean-Pierre Serre and proven by Ken Ribet. The proof was a significant step towards the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem (FLT). As shown by Serre and Ribet, the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (whose status was unresolved at the time) and the epsilon conjecture together imply that FLT is true.

In mathematical terms, Ribet&#x27;s theorem shows that if the Galois representation associated with an elliptic curve has certain properties, then that curve cannot be modular (in the sense that there cannot exist a modular form that gives rise to the same representation).

== Statement ==

Let be a weight 2 newform on – i.e. of level where does not divide – with absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional mod Galois representation unramified at if and finite flat at . Then there exists a weight 2 newform of level such that
:formula_1

In particular, if is an elliptic curve over formula_2 with conductor , then the modularity theorem guarantees that there exists a weight 2 newform of level such that the 2-dimensional mod Galois representation of is isomorphic to the 2-dimensional mod Galois representation of . To apply Ribet&#x27;s Theorem to , it suffices to check the irreducibility and ramification of . Using the theory of the Tate curve, one can prove that is unramified at and finite flat at if divides the power to which appears in the minimal discriminant . Then Ribet&#x27;s theorem implies that there exists a weight 2 newform of level such that .

== Level lowering ==

Ribet&#x27;s theorem states that beginning with an elliptic curve of conductor does not guarantee the existence of an elliptic curve of level such that . The newform of level may not have rational Fourier coefficients, and hence may be associated to a higher-dimensional abelian variety, not an elliptic curve. For example, elliptic curve 4171a1 in the Cremona database given by the equation

:formula_3

with conductor and discriminant does not level-lower mod 7 to an elliptic curve of conductor 97. Rather, the mod Galois representation is isomorphic to the mod Galois representation of an irrational newform of level 97.

However, for large enough compared to the level of the level-lowered newform, a rational newform (e.g. an elliptic curve) must level-lower to another rational newform (e.g. elliptic curve). In particular for , the mod Galois representation of a rational newform cannot be isomorphic to an irrational newform of level .

Similarly, the Frey-Mazur conjecture predicts that for large enough (independent of the conductor ), elliptic curves with isomorphic mod Galois representations are in fact isogenous, and hence have the same conductor. Thus non-trivial level-lowering between rational newforms is not predicted to occur for large .

== History ==
In his thesis, originated the idea of associating solutions (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) of Fermat&#x27;s equation with a different mathematical object: an elliptic curve. If &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are positive integers such that

:formula_4

then a corresponding Frey curve is an algebraic curve given by the equation

:formula_5

This is a nonsingular algebraic curve of genus one defined over formula_2, and its projective completion is an elliptic curve over formula_2.

In 1982 Gerhard Frey called attention to the unusual properties of the same curve, now called a Frey curve. This provided a bridge between Fermat and Taniyama by showing that a counterexample to FLT would create a curve that would not be modular. The conjecture attracted considerable interest when Frey suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture implies FLT. However, his argument was not complete. In 1985 Jean-Pierre Serre proposed that a Frey curve could not be modular and provided a partial proof. This showed that a proof of the semistable case of the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture would imply FLT. Serre did not provide a complete proof and the missing bit became known as the epsilon conjecture or ε-conjecture. In the summer of 1986, Kenneth Alan Ribet proved the epsilon conjecture, thereby proving that the Modularity theorem implied FLT.

The origin of the name is from the ε part of &quot;Taniyama-Shimura conjecture + ε ⇒ Fermat&#x27;s last theorem&quot;.

== Implications ==
Suppose that the Fermat equation with exponent had a solution in non-zero integers . The corresponding Frey curve is an elliptic curve whose minimal discriminant is equal to and whose conductor is the radical of , i.e. the product of all distinct primes dividing . An elementary consideration of the equation , makes it clear that one of is even and hence so is &quot;N&quot;. By the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, is a modular elliptic curve. Since all odd primes dividing in appear to a power in the minimal discriminant , by Ribet&#x27;s theorem repetitive level descent modulo strips all odd primes from the conductor. However, no newforms of level 2 remain because the genus of the modular curve is zero (and newforms of level &quot;N&quot; are differentials on .

<text>Cuiabá () is the capital city and the largest city of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. It is located near the geographical centre of South America and also forms the metropolitan area of Mato Grosso, along with the neighbouring town of Várzea Grande. The city&#x27;s name is an indigenous Bororo word meaning &#x27;arrow-fishing&#x27;, The city was founded in 1719, during the gold rush, and it has been the state capital since 1818. The city is a trading centre for an extensive cattle-raising and agricultural area. The capital is among the fastest-growing cities in Brazil, followed by the growth of agribusiness in Mato Grosso, despite the recession that is affecting Brazilian industries. Cuiabá was one of the host cities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Cuiabá is the heart of an urban area that also includes the state&#x27;s second largest city, Várzea Grande. The city is the seat of the Federal University of Mato Grosso and the largest football stadium of the state, Arena Pantanal.

The city is a rich mix of European, African and Native American influences and numerous museums reflect this. Cuiabá is also notable for its cuisine, dance, music and craftwork. Known as the &quot;Southern gate to the Amazon&quot;, Cuiabá experiences a hot humid tropical climate.

== History ==

=== Colonial period ===

The first Portuguese explorers to Cuiabá were bandeirantes, explorers, slavers, and fortune hunters based in the São Paulo region. The &quot;bandeirantes&quot; aided Brazil&#x27;s great expansion westward, including to the Mato Grosso region. Manoel de Campos Bicudo, a &quot;bandeirante&quot; from São Paulo, visited the Cuiabá region in 1673 and 1682. He founded the first village in the region where the Coxipó River flows into Cuiabá, and named it São Gonçalo Beira-Rio.

Pascoal Moreira Cabral, a bandeirante of Sorocaba, São Paulo, arrived at the site in 1718 and found it abandoned. He travelled up the Coxipó to enslave indigenous peoples, and fought a battle with the Coxiponé Indians, and lost. The bandeirantes returned down Coxipó, however, found gold, and enslaved indigenous people of the region for mining on the site. Cabral informed the Captaincy of São Paulo of his discovery in a letter dated April 8, 1719. He applied to be &quot;guarda‐mor regente&quot;, or guardian and supervisor of the mines. A gold rush immediately followed Cabral&#x27;s letter with prospectors mainly coming from the São Paulo region. Cabral &quot;manag[ed] disputes and problems of all kinds&quot; as guardian of the mines until his death in 1724.

Cuiabá was founded on January 1, 1727 by Rodrigo César de Menezes, then the &quot;captain&quot; of the captaincy of São Paulo in the aftermath of the discovery of gold mines. It was officially called the &quot;Vila Real do Senhor Bom Jesus de Cuiabá&quot;, a name taken from the district founded two years earlier. The Church of Our Lady of the Rosary was built at the time in the centre of the little town marked the location of a rich seam of gold. However, in 1746 much of the town was destroyed by an earthquake. Dom Antônio Rolim de Moura Tavares (1709–1782), the first Count of Azambuja, arrived in 1751 to serve as governor of the newly created Captaincy of Mato Grosso by King John V of Portugal. Tavares served in the position from 1751 to 1765, and founded Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade as the new capital of the captaincy.

=== 19th century ===

Cuiabá was elevated to township status in 1818. It became the capital of the Province of Mato Grosso in 1835 under the Empire of Brazil, replacing Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade. Many residents of Santíssima Trindade left for Cuiabá, leaving behind houses, commercial establishments, and slaves behind in the old capital.

From the late eighteenth century, until the time of the Paraguayan War (1864–1870), the town remained small and was in decline. The war, however, brought some infrastructure and a brief period of economic boom, with Cuiabá supplying sugar, foodstuffs, and timber to the Brazilian troops. After the war, the town was once again forgotten by the rest of the country, to such an extent that the Imperial and later the Republican governments of Brazil used to use it as a site of exile for troublesome politicians. Isolation allowed it to preserve many of the oldest Brazilian ways of life until well into the twentieth century.

=== 20th and 21st century ===

Starting in 1930, the isolation was diminished, with the construction of roads and later with the advent of aviation. The town became a city and would grow quite rapidly from 1960 onwards, after the establishment of the newly built Brazilian capital in Brasília.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the pace of growth would continue to increase as agriculture became commercialized, using the roads to transport soybeans and rice produced in the state in order to be sold abroad. The growth was such that from 1960 to 1980 the small town of 50,000 inhabitants grew into a giant, with more than a quarter of a million inhabitants (including those from the surrounding area and towns).

Since 1990, the rate of population growth has decreased, as other towns in the state have begun to attract more immigration than the capital. Tourism has emerged as a source of income and began to become a relevant area of the country, unlike before, when it was practically uninhabited. In 2023, Cuiabá was already considered one of the ten best cities in the country to live in, according to a UN study; it was also considered the second Brazilian city that most advanced in the last decade.

== Geography ==


Cuiabá borders the towns of Chapada dos Guimarães, Campo Verde, Santo Antônio do Leverger, Várzea Grande, Jangada and Acorizal. The city is an intersection of many major roads and waterways. However, on account of sand banks along the river, these waterways no longer support medium or large ships.

The third most important airport of the Brazilian Mid-West region is located in Cuiabá, and the city is the centre of an important and productive agricultural region. It is famous throughout Brazil as one of the country&#x27;s hottest cities, where temperatures are often above 40 °C (104 °F).

In central Cuiabá, an obelisk marks the exact center of the South American continent, as calculated in 1909. However, more accurate measurements in the 1990s located the exact center about northeast of Cuiabá, near the town of Chapada dos Guimarães.

The town sits in a transition zone between three of the most characteristic Brazilian ecosystems: Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal. It is also close to the mountain range known as Chapada dos Guimarães (which blocks polar masses and causes the extremely hot weather) and the city is also known as the Southern gate to the Amazon.

The municipality contains 11% of the Rio da Casca Ecological Station, a strictly protected conservation unit created in 1994.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Cuiabá has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw). Cuiabá is famous for its searing heat, although temperatures in winter can sometimes drop to . This is atypical, caused by cold fronts coming in from the south, and may only last one or two consecutive days then returning to the usual heat. The climate is tropical and humid. Rainfall is concentrated from October to April, the mass of dry air over the center of Brazil inhibiting the rain formation from May to September. The cold fronts dissipates the heat associated with the smoke produced by fires during the dry season. The relative humidity drops to very low levels, sometimes below 15%, increasing cases of respiratory diseases. The average annual rainfall is , with maximum intensity from December to March. The mean maximum temperature reaches , but the absolute maximum can reach in hotter months but is muffled on rainy days, when the maximum temperature is typically only . The average low in July, the coldest month is with wind chill of .

===Vegetation===

The Massairo Okamura State Park provides a green space with typical cerrado vegetation in the centre of a highly urbanized area.
It helps preserve the headwaters of the Barbado and Moinho streams.
The Zé Bolo Flô State Park is in the Grande Coxipó district.
The city also includes the Mãe Bonifácia State Park, created in 2000, also with typical cerrado trees.
Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. It is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Humid fields and &quot;buriti&quot; palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils.

&quot;Cerrado&quot; trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark, and leaves which are usually broad and rigid. Many herbaceous plants have extensive roots to store water and nutrients. The plant&#x27;s thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape. These adaptations protect the plants from destruction and make them capable of sprouting again after the fire.

===Distances===

From Rio de Janeiro - 
From Brasília - 

== Economy ==

The economy of Cuiabá is concentrated on commerce, services and industry. Commerce and services based in Cuiabá are important to the whole state, since the population is divided in several small agriculture-centered cities. People from these smaller cities often travel to the capital to access these services and buy goods not sold anywhere else.

The industrial sector is represented, basically, by agribusiness, particularly food processing. Many industries, mainly those that should be maintained far from the populous areas, have been set up in the Industrial District of Cuiabá (DIICC), which was founded in 1978. Even though it is located in one of the most agriculturally focused states of Brazil, Cuiabá itself only grows small vegetable farms, mainly family- or cooperative-based.

The city, with a GDP of 4.75 billion reals in 2003, according to the IBGE, is responsible for 21.99% of the total of the state GDP. Greater Cuiabá possesses, currently, four shopping centers registered in the HUGS (Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers), and another 8 commercial galleries.

The GDP for the city was R$7,189,521,000 (2006).

The per capita income for the city was R$13,244 (2006).

As with other capital cities in Brazil, there are parties across the city, known in Portuguese as the &quot;bailes do Carnaval&quot;. Cuiabá, like other cities in Brazil, holds an off-season Carnaval, known as the &quot;Carnaval fora de época&quot; or &quot;micareta&quot;; it is locally called the &quot;micarecuia&quot;.

==Transportation==

===International airport===

Marechal Rondon International Airport connects Cuiabá with many Brazilian cities and also operates some international flights. The runway at Marechal Rondon International Airport was opened to traffic in 1956. In February 1975, Infraero took over the airport&#x27;s administration and began various upgrades to meet the needs of the airport complex.

In 1996, Marechal Rondon Airport, located from the city center, started receiving international flights. Currently it serves more than 900 thousand passengers a year.

The airport has one building. There are two sections, upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs is all check-in terminals, and upstairs there are shops, eateries and an observation lounge.

===Highways===
Cuiabá is connected to the Pacific Ocean with the Interoceanic Highway, and to the Atlantic Ocean by the BR-364 Highway.

===Light rail===
A light rail line, that would connect Cuiabá with Várzea Grande in the Cuiabá metropolitan area and the international airport, was under construction and was originally intended to begin operations in time for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Due to political corruption commonly, the project was started and abandoned, as construction stopped and construction of the infrastructure never started being built, except for a section of the line near the airport, but it was never used. No line has ever been operational.

===Pipeline===

Thermal electric and hydroelectric plants located in the greater Cuiabá metropolitan area expanded in 2000 after the completion of the Pantanal Pipeline. The natural gas pipeline runs between Mato Grosso and Bolivia.

==Sports==
Cuiabá was one of 12 cities chosen to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Brazil. The games were to be played at the Arena Pantanal, a stadium completed in April 2014, with a capacity of 42,968. The stadium hosted four group matches in the tournament.
It replaced the old Estádio José Fragelli (Verdão), which used to be the principal football stadium of the city. Verdão got demolished in 2010, and works on the new stadium commenced later that year. The architects GCP Arquitetos have focused strongly on sustainability and one of the stadium&#x27;s noticeable features are the plants and trees that fill the four corner areas. Following completion, the stadium has become the permanent home of local sides Mixto EC and Cuiabá EC. Next to the football stadium is the Tocantins Gymnasium - Ginásio Aecim Tocantins.

The stadium has a car park of 15,000 spaces. Local side Mixto hold the record for most state titles, having won the Campeonato Mato-Grossense on 24 occasions. Mixto are also the only club from Mato Grosso to have played at the top level of Brazilian football, the Brasileirão, in 1976 and 1986. Even more contested than Manaus as a FIFA World Cup host city, Cuiabá represents both the positive and negative of Brazil&#x27;s hosting of the event. Negative because it is a relatively small, remote city with no great footballing tradition, best as its inclusion shows that the World Cup, geographically speaking at least, will be an event for all of Brazil and not just in the east coast capitals.

<text>Nek Chand Saini (15 December 1924 – 12 June 2015) was a self-taught Indian artist, known for building the Rock Garden of Chandigarh, an eighteen-acre sculpture garden in the city of Chandigarh.

==Early life and background==

Nek Chand hailed from Shakargarh tehsil. Shakargarh was previously in Gurdaspur district in British India, but now falls in district Narowal in Pakistan. His family moved to India in 1947 during the Partition. They moved to Chandigarh in 1955. At the time, the city was being redesigned as a modern utopia by the Swiss/French architect Le Corbusier. It was to be the first planned city in India, and Chand found work there as a roads inspector for the Public Works Department in 1951.

He was awarded the Padma Shri by Government of India in 1984. He died in 2015.

The Rock Garden is one of the most famous sites in India. Chand, its creator, died in 2015, but it is still visited by millions of people every year.

In his spare time, Nek Chand collected materials from demolition sites around the city. He recycled these materials into his own vision of the divine kingdom of Sukrani, New Delhi choosing a gorge in a forest near Sukhna Lake for his work. The gorge had been designated as a land conservancy, a forest buffer established in 1902 that nothing could be built on. Chand&#x27;s work was illegal, but he was able to hide it for eighteen years before it was discovered by the authorities in 1975. By this time, it had grown into a complex of interlinked courtyards, each filled with hundreds of pottery-covered concrete sculptures of dancers, musicians, and animals. Chand built up the mass with a cement and sand mix made from recycled materials before adding a final coating of smoothly burnished pure cement combined with waste materials such as broken glass, bangles, crockery, mosaic, and iron-foundry slag.

His work was in serious danger of being demolished, but he was able to get public opinion on his side, and in 1986 the park was inaugurated as a public space. Chand was given a salary, a title (&quot;Sub-Divisional Engineer, Rock Garden&quot;), and a workforce of 50 laborers so that he could concentrate full-time on his work. It even appeared on an Indian stamp in 1983. The Rock Garden is still made out of recycled materials; and with the government&#x27;s help, Chand was able to set up collection centers around the city for waste, especially rags and broken ceramics.

When Chand left the country on a lecture tour in 1996, the city withdrew its funding, and vandals attacked the park. The Rock Garden Society took over the administration and upkeep of this unique visionary environment. The garden is visited by over five thousand people daily, the second most popular location in India (after the Taj Mahal) with a total of more than twelve million visitors.

==Exhibitions==

Chand&#x27;s statues have found their way into museums across the world, including an environment at the Capitol Children&#x27;s Museum in Washington, D.C., the American Folk Art Museum in New York City and the main entrance to the Collection de l&#x27;art brut in Lausanne, Switzerland. The John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Wisconsin, USA owns the largest collection of Chand&#x27;s work outside of Chandigarh. The pieces were on exhibition there from June 2007 to January 2008 as part of the museum&#x27;s focus on artist environment builders, or outsider artists.

An exhibition of Chand&#x27;s work also took place at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) gallery in Liverpool, England from 16 April to 11 May 2007. The exhibition displayed survey drawings of the garden&#x27;s architecture and landscaping, and plans to be a travelling exhibition.

Numerous Nek Chand sculptures are also displayed in the gardens and on the walkways of the campus of the American Embassy School in New Delhi.

There is a Nek Chand Foundation in London founded to raise funds for the garden.

<text>Doolin () is a coastal village in County Clare, Ireland, on the Atlantic coast. It is southwest of the spa town of Lisdoonvarna and 4 miles from the Cliffs of Moher. It is a noted centre of traditional Irish music, which is played nightly in its pubs, making it a popular tourist destination. There are numerous nearby archaeological sites, many dating to the Iron Age and earlier. Doonagore Castle and Ballinalacken Castle are also in the area. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht (an Irish-speaking community) prior to the 1950s, and maintains a connection with Irish-speaking areas - including via its maritime connection with the Aran Islands.

==Amenities and tourism==
===Layout===
The village of Doolin does not have a defined centre, comprising a number of &quot;scattered&quot; sections:
* &quot;The Harbour&quot; is the departing point for boat trips to the Aran Islands and the Cliffs of Moher. There is also a campsite nearby
* &quot;Fisher Street&quot; has O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Pub and several shops and hostels.
* &quot;Fitz&#x27;s Cross&quot; has a hostel, campsite, two new hotels and another pub which opened in 2006
* &quot;Roadford&quot; has McGann&#x27;s and McDermott&#x27;s pubs, four restaurants, two hostels and a number of B&amp;Bs. Trips to Doolin Cave are also run from here.

The Aille River runs from the hills of the Burren down past Doolin to meet the sea. The small Crab Island is a short distance out from Doolin Harbour, barren except for the remains of an early 19th-century stone constabulary outpost.

===Doolin Cave===
The Great Stalactite, measuring 7.3 metres, was discovered in 1952. According to the Doolin Cave website, it is the largest stalactite in the Northern hemisphere. Owing to environmental protection measures, concurrent visitor numbers are limited to 20 per tour.

===Surfing===
Doolin is a noted surfing destination. A break which generates Ireland&#x27;s biggest wave, &#x27;Aill na Searrach&#x27;, is just off the Cliffs of Moher. The wave features in the movie Waveriders. Crab Island is also a local surfing spot.

===Rock climbing===

As well as serving as an accommodation centre for visitors to the major limestone rock climbing area of Ailladie (most climbs at or above E1 5b), a short 8 km drive away, Doolin has its own less-popular sea-cliff rock-climbing area, with several routes recorded. Like Ailladie, the cliffs are single-pitch steep limestone; however the rock is not of a high quality, the cliffs are tidal, and access is not as easy. There are also several smaller inland crags scattered throughout the Burren region (e.g. Ballyryan, Murroughkilly, Aill na Cronain and Oughtdarra), and some good bouldering to be found along the coast, most notably at Lackglass, which was first bouldered in April, 2005.

===Pubs===
Pubs in Doolin include Fitzpatricks, Gus O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s, McDermott&#x27;s, and McGann&#x27;s. The Micho Russell Festival Weekend is held each year after the last Friday in February.
===Dining===
The restaurant Homestead Cottage received a Michelin star in 2023.

==Transport==
===Ferry===

Doolin is one of three places (Galway and the village of Rossaveal on the northwest shore of Galway Bay are the others) with ferry services to the Aran Islands, which are visible from the town. A ferry service also brings tourists to the base of the Cliffs of Moher from Doolin Pier. There is also an Irish Coast Guard station at Doolin Pier.

===Bus===
As Doolin is close to the Cliffs of Moher, a bus service between Galway and Ennis calls at both Doolin and the cliffs in each direction. Bus Éireann route 350 links Doolin to Ennis, Ennistymon, Cliffs of Moher, Lisdoonvarna, Fanore, Kinvara and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway.

===Road===
Two regional roads serve the village. The R479 connects the village both with coastal areas to the north and with Lisdoonvarna to the east. The R459 connects the village to the Cliffs of Moher, the Burren Way and the Inisheer ferry port.

==People==
Musicians associated with Doolin, who have lived there or played in its pubs, include Micho Russell and his brothers Packie and Gussie, Sharon Shannon, Davy Spillane, and Steve Wickham of The Waterboys.

==Popular culture==
Doolin is the main setting for the 2007 PlayStation 3 game &quot;Folklore&quot;. According to the game&#x27;s storyline, the Netherworld, the world of the dead is a realm that can only be accessed from one place in the world, the sea-side village of Doolin.

The Celtic band Gaelic Storm has a fiddle tune which references the town called &quot;The Devil Went Down to Doolin&quot; (presumably a play on the popular song The Devil Went Down to Georgia) on their album Herding Cats.

<text>William Henry &quot;Dusty&quot; Hare (born 29 November 1952) is a former international rugby union footballer who played fullback.

Hare holds the world record for points scored in a first-class rugby career, with 7,337 points.

He was born in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire and attended the Magnus Grammar School (now Magnus Church of England School).

==Rugby career==
Hare played for Newark RUFC &amp; Nottingham R.F.C. before joining Leicester Tigers and playing nearly 400 games for them.

He made his England debut 16 March 1974 in a match against Wales, and played his final game ten years later on, having gained 25 caps. He toured with the British Lions to New Zealand in 1983.

He retired from club rugby after the 1989 cup final loss to Bath, and is now the chief scout at Northampton Saints. Previous to this job, Hare was a farmer in South Clifton, Nottinghamshire and had been since a young man carrying on the family business. However, Hare sold the farm in 2001 to take a full-time job at Leicester Tigers working for the academy and latterly as head scout.

In January 2010 it was announced that he was to join Northampton Saints. He returned to Tigers in 2017

==Cricket career==
Hare was also a good cricketer, and he played ten first-class and seven List A matches for Nottinghamshire between 1971 and 1977. He played regularly for the Nottinghamshire Second XI and Under-25s between 1969 and 1978.

<doc id="701016" wikidata="Q182247" url="?curid=701016" title="Ásmundur Sveinsson">
<text>Ásmundur Sveinsson (20 May 1893 – 9 December 1982) was an Icelandic sculptor, whose works include “Thor&#x27;s gavel”, the ornate gavel used by the President of United Nations General Assembly.

==Early years==
Ásmundur Sveinsson was born in Kolsstadir in West Iceland on 20 May 1893. In 1915 he moved to Reykjavík where he enrolled in the Technical College of Iceland and apprenticed with sculptor Ríkarður Jónsson for four years. In 1919 he relocated to Copenhagen, Denmark, and from there to Stockholm, Sweden, where he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts where he remained for six years, much of it spent studying with sculptor Carl Milles. 
In 1924 he married sculptor Gunnfríður Jónsdóttir. He and Gunnfríður divorced several years later. After graduating from the Academy, Ásmundur moved to Paris, France where he continued his study, here under the sculptor Charles Despiau.

==Work==
Ásmundur returned to Iceland in 1929 and began producing a series of abstracted figurative works. His themes were often men and women at work and included such pieces as, &quot;The Blacksmith&quot;, &quot;The Washer Women,&quot; and &quot;The Water Carrier&quot;. During the 1940s Ásmundur&#x27;s work moved even farther away from the human and animal form that had been his mainstay until then and by the 1950s he was producing work that was almost entirely abstract.

Like many Icelandic artists, he drew upon the traditions of his native country when seeking subjects to inspire him. In 1939, for example, Ásmundur&#x27;s sculpture of Guðríðr Þorbjarnardóttir and her son Snorri was displayed at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. Casts of his original smaller scuplture of the pair were later installed in Iceland, at both Glaumbær and Laugarbrekka, and gifted to the Canadian government and the Vatican. Other works of Ásmundur&#x27;s drawing on Icelandic traditions include &quot;Trollwoman&quot; (1948), &quot;Head Ransom&quot; (1948), based on a poem that Egil Skallagrimsson purportedly composed to save his own head, and &quot;Hel-Ride&quot; (1944) taken from the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturlusson. His &quot;Sæmundur and the Seal&quot;, also in this vein, is situated in front of the main building of the University of Iceland in Reykjavík.

Generally, the artist believed in placing works of art not only in the hands of a small elite, but also in making them accessible to the public. Other works of Ásmundur Sveinsson are to be found on the hill Öskjuhlíð near Perlan in Reykjavík or at the farm of Borg á Mýrum near Borgarnes. The abstract sculpture here represents the saga hero Egill having his dead son in his arms. The title Sonartorrek is referring to a poem which Egill Skallagrimsson wrote about this scene. Ásmundur died in Reykjavík on 9 December 1982. In 2015, his statue of poet Einar Benediktsson was moved to a spot near Höfði house in Reykjavik, where the poet had lived.

==Ásmundarsafn==

The former house of the artist in Laugardalur, Reykjavík, has been installed as a museum, called Ásmundarsafn. The house was constructed from 1942 until ca. 1958 in three parts, based on designs drawn by the artist who was a fan of the Bauhaus style. He lived there through most of his life with his second wife, Ingrid Sveinsson. The house is slightly reminiscent of Le Corbusier and his chapel of Ronchamp. The sculpture garden nearby is open to public.

<doc id="701050" wikidata="Q5458747" url="?curid=701050" title="Fletcher's checksum">
<text>The Fletcher checksum is an algorithm for computing a position-dependent checksum devised by John G. Fletcher (1934–2012) at Lawrence Livermore Labs in the late 1970s. The objective of the Fletcher checksum was to provide error-detection properties approaching those of a cyclic redundancy check but with the lower computational effort associated with summation techniques.

==The algorithm==

===Review of simple checksums===

As with simpler checksum algorithms, the Fletcher checksum involves dividing the binary data word to be protected from errors into short &quot;blocks&quot; of bits and computing the modular sum of those blocks. (Note that the terminology used in this domain can be confusing. The data to be protected, in its entirety, is referred to as a &quot;word&quot;, and the pieces into which it is divided are referred to as &quot;blocks&quot;.)

As an example, the data may be a message to be transmitted consisting of 136 characters, each stored as an 8-bit byte, making a data word of 1088 bits in total. A convenient block size would be 8 bits, although this is not required. Similarly, a convenient modulus would be 255, although, again, others could be chosen. So, the simple checksum is computed by adding together all the 8-bit bytes of the message, dividing by 255 and keeping only the remainder. (In practice, the modulo operation is performed during the summation to control the size of the result.) The checksum value is transmitted with the message, increasing its length to 137 bytes, or 1096 bits. The receiver of the message can re-compute the checksum and compare it to the value received to determine whether the message has been altered by the transmission process.

===Weaknesses of simple checksums===

The first weakness of the simple checksum is that it is insensitive to the order of the blocks (bytes) in the data word (message). If the order is changed, the checksum value will be the same and the change will not be detected. The second weakness is that the universe of checksum values is small, being equal to the chosen modulus. In our example, there are only 255 possible checksum values, so it is easy to see that even random data has about a 0.4% probability of having the same checksum as our message.

===The Fletcher checksum===

Fletcher addresses both of these weaknesses by computing a second value along with the simple checksum. This is the modular sum of the values taken by the simple checksum as each block of the data word is added to it. The modulus used is the same. So, for each block of the data word, taken in sequence, the block&#x27;s value is added to the first sum and the new value of the first sum is then added to the second sum. Both sums start with the value zero (or some other known value). At the end of the data word, the modulus operator is applied and the two values are combined to form the Fletcher checksum value.

Sensitivity to the order of blocks is introduced because once a block is added to the first sum, it is then repeatedly added to the second sum along with every block after it. If, for example, two adjacent blocks become exchanged, the one that was originally first will be added to the second sum one fewer times and the one that was originally second will be added to the second sum one more time. The final value of the first sum will be the same, but the second sum will be different, detecting the change to the message.

The universe of possible checksum values is now the square of the value for the simple checksum. In our example, the two sums, each with 255 possible values, result in 65025 possible values for the combined checksum.

==Overview of the different algorithm parameters==
While there is an infinity of parameters, the original paper only studies the case K=8 (word length) with modulus 255 and 256.

The 16 and 32 bits versions (Fletcher-32 and -64) have been derived from the original case and studied in subsequent specifications or papers.

===Fletcher-16===

When the data word is divided into 8-bit blocks, as in the example above, two 8-bit sums result and are combined into a 16-bit Fletcher checksum. Usually, the second sum will be multiplied by 256 and added to the simple checksum, effectively stacking the sums side-by-side in a 16-bit word with the simple checksum at the least significant end. This algorithm is then called the Fletcher-16 checksum. The use of the modulus 28−1=255 is also generally implied.

===Fletcher-32===

When the data word is divided into 16-bit blocks, two 16-bit sums result and are combined into a 32-bit Fletcher checksum. Usually, the second sum will be multiplied by 216 and added to the simple checksum, effectively stacking the sums side-by-side in a 32-bit word with the simple checksum at the least significant end. This algorithm is then called the Fletcher-32 checksum. The use of the modulus 216−1=65,535 is also generally implied. The rationale for this choice is the same as for Fletcher-16.

===Fletcher-64===

When the data word is divided into 32-bit blocks, two 32-bit sums result and are combined into a 64-bit Fletcher checksum. Usually, the second sum will be multiplied by 232 and added to the simple checksum, effectively stacking the sums side-by-side in a 64-bit word with the simple checksum at the least significant end. This algorithm is then called the Fletcher-64 checksum. The use of the modulus 232−1=4,294,967,295 is also generally implied. The rationale for this choice is the same as for Fletcher-16 and Fletcher-32.

===Comparison with the Adler checksum===

The Adler-32 checksum is a specialization of the Fletcher-32 checksum devised by Mark Adler. The modulus selected (for both sums) is the prime number 65,521 (65,535 is divisible by 3, 5, 17 and 257). The first sum also begins with the value 1. The selection of a prime modulus results in improved &quot;mixing&quot; (error patterns are detected with more uniform probability, improving the probability that the least detectable patterns will be detected, which tends to dominate overall performance). However, the reduction in size of the universe of possible checksum values acts against this and reduces performance slightly. One study showed that Fletcher-32 outperforms Adler-32 in both performance and in its ability to detect errors. As modulo-65,535 addition is considerably simpler and faster to implement than modulo-65,521 addition, the Fletcher-32 checksum is generally a faster algorithm.

==Caution on modulus==
A modulus of 255 is used above and in examples below for Fletcher-16, however some real-world implementations use 256. The TCP protocol&#x27;s alternate checksum has Fletcher-16 with a 256 modulus, as do the checksums of UBX-* messages from a U-blox GPS.
Which modulus is used is dependent on the implementation.

==Example calculation of the Fletcher-16 checksum==

As an example, a Fletcher-16 checksum shall be calculated and verified for a byte stream of 0x01 0x02. 
* C0_initial = 0
* C1_initial = 0
The checksum is therefore 0x0403. It could be transmitted with the byte stream and be verified as such on the receiving end.
Another option is to compute in a second step a pair of check bytes, which can be appended to the byte stream so that the resulting stream has a global Fletcher-16 checksum value of 0.
The values of the checkbytes are computed as follows:
* CB0 = 255 − ((C0 + C1) mod 255),
* CB1 = 255 − ((C0 + CB0) mod 255),
where C0 and C1 are the result of the last step in the Fletcher-16 computation.

In our case the checksum bytes are CB0 = 0xF8 and CB1 = 0x04. The transmitted byte stream is 0x01 0x02 0xF8 0x04. The receiver runs the checksum on all four bytes and calculates a passing checksum of 0x00 0x00, as illustrated below:
==Weaknesses==

The Fletcher checksum cannot distinguish between blocks of all 0 bits and blocks of all 1 bits. For example, if a 16-bit block in the data word changes from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, the Fletcher-32 checksum remains the same. This also means a sequence of all 00 bytes has the same checksum as a sequence (of the same size) of all FF bytes.

==Implementation==
These examples assume two&#x27;s complement arithmetic, as Fletcher&#x27;s algorithm will be incorrect on ones&#x27; complement machines.

===Straightforward===
The below is a treatment on how to calculate the checksum including the check bytes; i.e., the final result should equal 0, given properly-calculated check bytes. The code by itself, however, will not calculate the check bytes.

An inefficient but straightforward implementation of a C language function to compute the Fletcher-16 checksum of an array of 8-bit data elements follows:

uint16_t Fletcher16( uint8_t *data, int count )
 uint16_t sum1 = 0;
 uint16_t sum2 = 0;
 int index;

 for ( index = 0; index &lt; count; ++index )
 sum1 = (sum1 + data[index]) % 255;
 sum2 = (sum2 + sum1) % 255;

 return (sum2 « 8) | sum1;


On lines 3 and 4, the sums are 16-bit variables so that the additions on lines 9 and 10 will not overflow. The modulo operation is applied to the first sum on line 9 and to the second sum on line 10. Here, this is done after each addition, so that at the end of the for loop the sums are always reduced to 8 bits. At the end of the input data, the two sums are combined into the 16-bit Fletcher checksum value and returned by the function on line 13.

Each sum is computed modulo 255 and thus remains less than 0xFF at all times. This implementation will thus never produce the checksum results 0x??FF, 0xFF?? or 0xFFFF (i.e., 511 out of the total 65536 possible 16-bit values are never used). It can produce the checksum result 0x0000, which may not be desirable in some circumstances (e.g. when this value has been reserved to mean &quot;no checksum has been computed&quot;).

===Check bytes===
Example source code for calculating the check bytes, using the above function, is as follows. The check bytes may be appended to the end of the data stream, with the c0 coming before the c1.

uint16_t csum;
uint16_t c0,c1,f0,f1;

csum = Fletcher16(data, length);
f0 = csum &amp; 0xff;
f1 = (csum » 8) &amp; 0xff;
c0 = 0xff - ((f0 + f1) % 0xff);
c1 = 0xff - ((f0 + c0) % 0xff);
===Optimizations===
In a 1988 paper, Anastase Nakassis discussed and compared different ways to optimize the algorithm. The most important optimization consists in using larger accumulators and delaying the relatively costly modulo operation for as long as it can be proven that no overflow will occur. Further benefit can be derived from replacing the modulo operator with an equivalent function tailored to this specific case—for instance, a simple compare-and-subtract, since the quotient never exceeds 1.

Here is a C implementation that applies the first but not the second optimization:

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* for size_t */
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt; /* for uint8_t, uint16_t &amp; uint32_t */

uint16_t fletcher16(const uint8_t *data, size_t len) {
 uint32_t c0, c1;

 /* Found by solving for c1 overflow: */
 /* n &gt; 0 and n * (n+1) / 2 * (2^8-1) &lt; (2^32-1). */
 for (c0 = c1 = 0; len &gt; 0; ) {
 size_t blocklen = len;
 if (blocklen &gt; 5802) {
 blocklen = 5802;
 len -= blocklen;
 do {
 c0 = c0 + *data++;
 c1 = c1 + c0;
 } while (--blocklen);
 c0 = c0 % 255;
 c1 = c1 % 255;
 return (c1 « 8 | c0);

uint32_t fletcher32(const uint16_t *data, size_t len) {
 uint32_t c0, c1;
 len = (len + 1) &amp; ~1; /* Round up len to words */

 /* We similarly solve for n &gt; 0 and n * (n+1) / 2 * (2^16-1) &lt; (2^32-1) here. */
 /* On modern computers, using a 64-bit c0/c1 could allow a group size of 23726746. */
 for (c0 = c1 = 0; len &gt; 0; ) {
 size_t blocklen = len;
 if (blocklen &gt; 360*2) {
 blocklen = 360*2;
 len -= blocklen;
 do {
 c0 = c0 + *data++;
 c1 = c1 + c0;
 } while ((blocklen -= 2));
 c0 = c0 % 65535;
 c1 = c1 % 65535;
 return (c1 « 16 | c0);

// A similar routine could be written for fletcher64. The group size would be 92681.
The second optimization is not used because the &quot;never exceeds 1&quot; assumption only applies when the modulo is calculated naively; applying the first optimization would break it. On the other hand, modulo Mersenne numbers like 255 and 65535 is a quick operation on computers anyway, as tricks are available to do them without the costly division operation.

===Test vectors===

 &quot;abcdefgh&quot; -&gt; 3543817411021686982 (0x312E2B28CCCAC8C6)

===Bit and byte ordering (endianness / network order)===

As with any calculation that divides a binary data word into short blocks and treats the blocks as numbers, any two systems expecting to get the same result should preserve the ordering of bits in the data word. In this respect, the Fletcher checksum is not different from other checksum and CRC algorithms and needs no special explanation.

An ordering problem that is easy to envision occurs when the data word is transferred byte-by-byte between a big-endian system and a little-endian system and the Fletcher-32 checksum is computed. If blocks are extracted from the data word in memory by a simple read of a 16-bit unsigned integer, then the values of the blocks will be different in the two systems, due to the reversal of the byte order of 16-bit data elements in memory, and the checksum result will be different as a consequence. The implementation examples, above, do not address ordering issues so as not to obscure the checksum algorithm. Because the Fletcher-16 checksum uses 8-bit blocks, it is not affected by byte endianness.

<text>Karl Sven Woytek Sas Konkovitch Matthew Kruszelnicki (born 1948), often referred to as Dr Karl, is an Australian science communicator and populariser, who is known as an author and a science commentator on Australian radio, television, and podcasts.

Kruszelnicki is the Julius Sumner Miller Fellow in the Science Foundation for Physics at the School of Physics, University of Sydney.

==Early life==
Kruszelnicki () was born in Helsingborg, Sweden, to Polish parents, Rina and Ludwik. Kruszelnicki&#x27;s background was hidden from him for a long time, with his mother having told him that she was Swedish and a Lutheran but she was, in fact, Polish and Jewish. Both his parents were Holocaust survivors. His father Ludwik, a Polish Gentile, was turned in to the Gestapo for smuggling Jews out of Poland and was imprisoned at Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp used mainly for political prisoners. As the end of World War II approached, Ludwik avoided execution by swapping identities with a dead person. Rina escaped the Auschwitz concentration camp when the Nazis ran out of Zyklon B that was used to gas prisoners. They separately fled to Sweden, where they met, and where Karl was born.

When Kruszelnicki was two years old, his parents became concerned about the risk of Sweden being overrun by Russia and decided to flee the country. Before boarding a boat bound for America, Karl became ill with fever following a smallpox vaccination. Worried for his health, his parents decided not to board the boat. &quot;Luck has it that the next ship went to Australia, so that is where we ended up. It is amazing how fate can take you in unexpected directions.&quot;

On arrival in Australia, the family were tenanted at the migrant camp in Bonegilla, Victoria. They remained there for three years before settling in the city of Wollongong, New South Wales. Kruszelnicki said his childhood as a refugee in Wollongong was difficult, and he was bullied at school; he said &quot;anybody who was not an Irish Catholic was considered an outsider&quot;. He found an escape in the Wollongong Library, where he became interested in science fiction.

Kruszelnicki attended Edmund Rice Christian Brothers College in Wollongong, New South Wales. After high school, he attended the University of Wollongong, completing a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in physics in 1968. In 1980, Kruszelnicki was awarded a Master of Biomedical Engineering degree at the University of New South Wales. He completed his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees at Sydney University in 1986.

After primary school, Kruszelnicki&#x27;s first job was ditch digger in the Wollongong suburb of Dapto. He also worked as a filmmaker, car mechanic, TV weatherman and as roadie for Slim Dusty, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. While working as a taxi driver in Sydney, he was beaten unconscious after picking up a passenger trying to escape a group of men.

== Science career ==
After graduating from university at age 19, Kruszelnicki took a job as a physicist working for a steel works in his home town of Wollongong. He designed a machine to test the strength of steel made for use in Melbourne&#x27;s West Gate Bridge, which was under construction at the time. After he was asked to fake the results of his tests, he resigned.

In the early 1980s, Kruszelnicki worked for ophthalmologist Fred Hollows. His Master of Biomedical Engineering degree allowed him to design and build a machine to pick up electrical signals off the human retina to diagnose certain eye diseases.

Kruszelnicki commenced his degree in medicine at the University of Sydney at the age of 32, graduating in 1986. From here he began work at a number of hospitals around Sydney, including the Children&#x27;s Hospital in Camperdown. He talks fondly of his time as a children&#x27;s doctor, though he left this profession after witnessing the first child die from whooping cough in twenty years. This came about, he says, after a television program tried to create controversy by presenting the efficacy of vaccinations with a false balance. This caused a drop in herd immunity, and eventually the death of this child. &quot;That very strongly influenced me to go into the media, because I felt like I could do more good there (convincing people to vaccinate). And as a result, I gave up the best job of my life, which was being a doctor in a kids&#x27; hospital, so I could do more good in the community.&quot;

===Television===
Kruszelnicki presented the first series of &quot;Quantum&quot; (replaced by &quot;Catalyst&quot;) in 1985. As a science communicator and presenter, he appears on the Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot; and on ABC TV. From early 2008 to 2010 he co-hosted a TV series called &quot;Sleek Geeks&quot; with Adam Spencer.

Kruszelnicki presented a program on ABC TV in January 2025 titled &quot;Dr Karl&#x27;s How Things Work&quot;.

=== Journalism, radio and podcasts ===
Kruszelnicki does a number of weekly radio shows and podcasts. His hour-long show on ABC radio station Triple J has been going on in one form or another since 1981; this weekly science talkback show, &quot;Science with Dr Karl&quot;, is broadcast on Thursday mornings from 11:00 am to midday and attracts up to 300,000 listeners; it is also available as a podcast.

Kruszelnicki also often helps with other science and education Triple J promotions such as the Sleek Geek Week roadshow with Adam Spencer and Caroline Pegram. He and Adam Spencer released the &quot;Sleek Geeks&quot; podcast regularly until December 2015. Also, Since 2016, he has hosted the podcast &quot;Shirtloads of Science.&quot;

For many years, until March 2020, Kruszelnicki appeared on a live weekly late-night link-up on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Up All Night&quot;, usually with Rhod Sharp, answering science questions. In 2017, he hosted &quot;Dr. Karl&#x27;s Outrageous Acts of Science&quot; on Discovery Channel (Australia).

Kruszelnicki writes a regular column for &quot;Australian Geographic&quot; magazine, called &#x27;Need to Know&#x27;, which is republished as a blog on the magazine&#x27;s website. He has also written for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; &quot;Good Weekend&quot; magazine.

In 1981, he appeared on an Australian radio documentary about death and near-death experiences that aired on the ABC, &quot;And When I Die, Will I Be Dead?&quot; It was adapted into a book in 1987.

==Politics==

Kruszelnicki was an unsuccessful candidate for the Australian Senate in the 2007 Australian federal election. He was placed number two on the Climate Change Coalition ticket in New South Wales.

In 2015, Kruszelnicki appeared in an Australian Government advertising campaign for the recently published intergenerational report. He had previously agreed to do the campaign, believing it would be a &quot;non-political, bipartisan, independent report.&quot; After its publication, however, he backed away from the campaign, describing it as &quot;flawed&quot;. &quot;How can you possibly have a report that looks at the next 40 years and doesn&#x27;t mention climate change? It should have acknowledged that climate change is real and we cause it and it will be messy.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kruszelnicki met his wife Mary in his first year of medical school. They have three children together: Karl, Alice, and Lola.

Kruszelnicki has prosopagnosia, meaning he lacks the ability to recognise faces. To help him recognise co-workers, he has been known to carry a seating map of familiar office spaces. He puts the cause of his condition down to having an unhappy, lonely childhood, saying that it impeded the development of the part of his brain responsible for remembering faces.

==Recognition and awards==
In 2000, the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; Internet Awards awarded Kruszelnicki the Best Science and Technology Website.

In the 2001 honours list, he was awarded the Centenary Medal &quot;for major service in raising public awareness of the importance of science and technology&quot;.

One of Kruszelnicki&#x27;s more notable undertakings was his part in a research project on belly button fluff, for which he received the tongue-in-cheek Ig Nobel Prize in 2002.

He received the Australian Father of the Year award in 2003.

In the 2006 honours list, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia.

In 2006, the Australian Skeptics recognised him as the Australian Skeptic Of The Year.

In 2012, Kruszelnicki was named as a National Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

In 2012, Main-belt asteroid 18412 Kruszelnicki was named in his honour.

In 2014, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; readers voted Kruszelnicki as the ninth-most-trusted person in Australia

In 2016, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of the Sunshine Coast.

Kruszelnicki won UNESCO&#x27;s 2019 Kalinga Prize for science communication.

<text>Albert Victor Bäcklund (11 January 1845 – 23 February 1922) was a Swedish mathematician and physicist. He was a professor at Lund University and its rector from 1907 to 1909.

He was born in Malmöhus County, now Skåne County, in southern Sweden and became a student at the nearby University of Lund in 1861. In 1864 he started to work for the observatory, and received his Ph.D. in 1868 working on methods to obtain the latitude of a place by astronomical observations. He was awarded the title of associate professor in Mechanics and Mathematical Physics in 1878, and elected Fellow of the Swedish Academy of Science in 1888. In 1897 he became a full professor.

In 1874 he was awarded a travel grant to study abroad for six months. He went to the universities at Leipzig and Erlangen to work with Felix Klein and Ferdinand von Lindemann.

His most important work was in the field of transformations pioneered by Sophus Lie. He improved greatly the understanding of contact transformations and introduced a new second class transformation, now known as auto-Bäcklund transformation.

<text>Luigi Bianchi (18 January 1856 – 6 June 1928) was an Italian mathematician. He was born in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, and died in Pisa. He was a leading member of the vigorous geometric school which flourished in Italy during the later years of the 19th century and the early years of the twentieth century.

==Biography==
Like his friend and colleague Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, Bianchi studied at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa under Enrico Betti, a leading differential geometer who is today best remembered for his seminal contributions to topology, and Ulisse Dini, a leading expert on function theory. Bianchi was also greatly influenced by the geometrical ideas of Bernhard Riemann and by the work on transformation groups of Sophus Lie and Felix Klein. Bianchi became a professor at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in 1896, where he spent the remainder of his career. At Pisa, his colleagues included the talented Ricci. In 1890, Bianchi and Dini supervised the dissertation of the noted analyst and geometer Guido Fubini.

In 1898, Bianchi worked out the Bianchi classification of nine possible isometry classes of three-dimensional Lie groups of isometries of a (sufficiently symmetric) Riemannian manifold. As Bianchi knew, this is essentially the same thing as classifying, up to isomorphism, the three-dimensional real Lie algebras. This complements the earlier work of Lie himself, who had earlier classified the &quot;complex&quot; Lie algebras.

Through the influence of Luther P. Eisenhart and Abraham Haskel Taub, Bianchi&#x27;s classification later came to play an important role in the development of the theory of general relativity. Bianchi&#x27;s list of nine isometry classes, which can be regarded as Lie algebras, Lie groups, or as three-dimensional homogeneous (possibly nonisotropic) Riemannian manifolds, are now often called collectively the Bianchi groups.

In 1902, Bianchi rediscovered what are now called the Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor, which play an even more important role in general relativity. (They are essential for understanding the Einstein field equation.) According to Tullio Levi-Civita, these identities had first been discovered by Ricci in about 1889, but Ricci apparently forgot all about the matter, which led to Bianchi&#x27;s rediscovery. However, the contracted Bianchi identities, which are sufficient for the proof that the divergence of the Einstein tensor always vanishes, had been published by Aurel Voss in 1880.

<text>Grove Oak is a small unincorporated community in DeKalb County, Alabama, United States. It is located atop Sand Mountain in northeastern Alabama.

Grove Oak has one store, and is surrounded by forests and farmland. There are two Baptist churches. There is a small Masonic lodge and a now-closed junior high school. It also has a restaurant that has been in and out of business several times.

Until about the mid-1970s, it was the center of a farming community and had its own cotton gin. Today, farming is not so much the focus, and most working members of the Grove Oak community drive to factories or other jobs in the larger towns nearby. Limited farming, cattle, and poultry raising takes place in and around the town.

==Geography==
Grove Oak is located at . Its average elevation is above sea level.

<doc id="701077" wikidata="Q3537515" url="?curid=701077" title="Bäcklund transform">
<text>In mathematics, Bäcklund transforms or Bäcklund transformations (named after the Swedish mathematician Albert Victor Bäcklund) relate partial differential equations and their solutions. They are an important tool in soliton theory and integrable systems. A Bäcklund transform is typically a system of first order partial differential equations relating two functions, and often depending on an additional parameter. It implies that the two functions separately satisfy partial differential equations, and each of the two functions is then said to be a Bäcklund transformation of the other.

A Bäcklund transform which relates solutions of the &quot;same&quot; equation is called an invariant Bäcklund transform or auto-Bäcklund transform. If such a transform can be found, much can be deduced about the solutions of the equation especially if the Bäcklund transform contains a parameter. However, no systematic way of finding Bäcklund transforms is known.

== History ==

Bäcklund transforms have their origins in differential geometry: the first nontrivial example is the transformation of pseudospherical surfaces introduced by L. Bianchi and A.V. Bäcklund in the 1880s. This is a geometrical construction of a new pseudospherical surface from an initial such surface using a solution of a linear differential equation. Pseudospherical surfaces can be described as solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, and hence the Bäcklund transformation of surfaces can be viewed as a transformation of solutions of the sine-Gordon equation.

==The Cauchy–Riemann equations==

The prototypical example of a Bäcklund transform is the Cauchy–Riemann system

:formula_1

which relates the real and imaginary parts formula_2 and formula_3 of a holomorphic function. This first order system of partial differential equations has the following properties.

# If formula_2 and formula_3 are solutions of the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then formula_2 is a solution of the Laplace equation formula_7 (i.e., a harmonic function), and so is formula_3. This follows straightforwardly by differentiating the equations with respect to formula_9 and formula_10 and using the fact that formula_11
# Conversely if formula_2 is a solution of Laplace&#x27;s equation, then there exist functions formula_3 which solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations together with formula_2.
Thus, in this case, a Bäcklund transformation of a harmonic function is just a conjugate harmonic function. The above properties mean, more precisely, that Laplace&#x27;s equation for formula_2 and Laplace&#x27;s equation for formula_3 are the integrability conditions for solving the Cauchy–Riemann equations.

These are the characteristic features of a Bäcklund transform. If we have a partial differential equation in formula_2, and a Bäcklund transform from formula_2 to formula_3, we can deduce a partial differential equation satisfied by formula_3.

This example is rather trivial, because all three equations (the equation for formula_2, the equation for formula_3 and the Bäcklund transform relating them) are linear. Bäcklund transforms are most interesting when just one of the three equations is linear.

==The sine-Gordon equation==

Suppose that &quot;u&quot; is a solution of the sine-Gordon equation
:formula_23

Then the system
:formula_24
where &quot;a&quot; is an arbitrary parameter, is solvable for a function &quot;v&quot; which will also satisfy the sine-Gordon equation. This is an example of an auto-Bäcklund transform.

By using a matrix system, it is also possible to find a linear Bäcklund transform for solutions of sine-Gordon equation.

==The Liouville equation==

A Bäcklund transform can turn a non-linear partial differential equation into a simpler, linear, partial differential equation.

For example, if &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are related via the Bäcklund transform

:formula_25
where &quot;a&quot; is an arbitrary parameter, and if &quot;u&quot; is a solution of the Liouville equation

formula_26

then &quot;v&quot; is a solution of the much simpler equation, formula_27, and vice versa.

We can then solve the (non-linear) Liouville equation by working with a much simpler linear equation.

<text>Victorinox () is a knife manufacturer and watchmaker based in the town of Ibach, in the Canton of Schwyz, Switzerland. It is known for its Swiss Army knives. Since its acquisition of rival Wenger in 2005, it has become the sole supplier of multi-purpose knives to the Swiss army. It is the world&#x27;s biggest manufacturer of pocket knives; additionally, the company licenses its logo for watches, apparel, and travel gear.

==History==
=== Founding ===
The company was founded in 1884 as , the workshop of Karl Elsener in Ibach. In 1891, Elsener co-founded an association of Swiss knife manufacturers. This began their relationship delivering knives to the Swiss army. In 1892, most of Elsener&#x27;s knife craftsmen left knives manufacturing as it became apparent that Solingen manufacturers could deliver at a lower price. Elsener persisted in competing with Solingen, hence incurring severe financial losses.

Elsener&#x27;s was patented in 1897, and was later marketed internationally as the &quot;Original Swiss Army Knife&quot;. This knife was not adopted by the Swiss Armed Forces as ordnance, but its commercial success allowed the company to recover financially.

Upon the death of his mother in 1909, Elsener named the brand &quot;Victoria&quot; in her honor. The same year, the Swiss coat of arms was introduced as the company logo. In 1921, the company changed its trade name to the present &quot;Victorinox&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;inox&quot;, an abbreviation for &quot;acier inoxydable&quot;, French for stainless steel. Its legal name was officially changed in 1979.

=== Original versus Genuine ===
From 1908 to 2005, the delivery of knives to the Swiss Armed Forces was shared with Wenger. A compromise between the two companies stated that Victorinox would market their knives as the &quot;Original Swiss Army Knives&quot;, while Wenger would market theirs as &quot;Genuine Swiss Army Knives&quot;. Wenger was acquired by Victorinox in 2005. Knives actually made for the army (as opposed to the generic &quot;Swiss Army&quot; trademark) are known as (&quot;soldier knives&quot;). These were produced in five generations, known by the date of their introduction as models 1890, 1908, 1951, 1961 and &quot;08&quot; (with minor variants within each generation). Model 1890 was originally produced by Wester &amp; Co, Solingen, and produced by Elsenser in competition with the Solingen manufacturer. Models 1908 and 1951 were also produced by several companies in Germany and Switzerland. Model 1961 was produced exclusively by Victorinox and Wenger, and Model 08, introduced after the acquisition of Wenger, is exclusively manufactured by Victorinox.

=== Swiss army issued knives: 1890–2008 ===
As issued by the Swiss Army.

=== Victorinox in North America ===
In 1972, the Forschner Butcher Scale Company of New Britain, Connecticut became the exclusive Victorinox distributor for the United States. In 1981, the company went public, and Charles Elsener, president of Victorinox, acquired a significant percentage of its shares. In 1983, it was renamed the Forschner Group, Inc. In the 1980s, Forschner registered the Swiss Army name as a trademark in the USA. In 1992, Precise Imports Corp., a U.S. and Canadian importer of Wenger knives, sued and Forschner retained the rights to use the trademark on its compasses, timepieces, and sunglasses, while Precise could use it in marketing other non-knife items. In the mid-1990s, Forschner changed its name to Swiss Army Brands, Inc. (SABI).

In 2001, Victorinox teamed up with SABI to establish an international watch company, Victorinox Swiss Army Watch AG. In August 2002, Victorinox acquired all remaining shares of SABI to gain control of the Swiss Army trademark. Previously, SABI had sold the Swiss Army branded watch in North America and—under the license—the Victorinox branded watch outside North America. But afterwards, the combined Victorinox Swiss Army brand has been marketed worldwide.

=== Wenger acquisition ===
On 26 April 2005, Victorinox acquired Wenger, the other official supplier of the Swiss Army knife, announcing that it intended to keep both brands intact, only separate entities.

In 2006, the company had a workforce of 900 employees. Its daily output was about Swiss Army knives, multi-tools, and household kitchen knives. Approximately 90% of its production is exported to more than 100 countries. To avoid this, they set aside profits during boom periods to supplement recessionary periods as well as temporarily contracting employees to other companies as outsourced labor during recessions.

On 30 January 2013, Victorinox announced that the company was merging Wenger&#x27;s knife product lines with the Victorinox brand to strengthen its competitive position internationally.

=== Bushcraft usage ===
The Farmer model was adopted by the &quot;Bushcraft&quot; community as their folding knife (circa 2005).

=== Luggage and clothing ===
In 2014, Victorinox acquired the TRG Group from Centric Group. For several years, TRG Group was the Victorinox licensee for the manufacturing of luggage and travel-oriented products. Victorinox integrated TRG Group in the company as the Victorinox Travel Gear division.

In 2017, Victorinox decided to close the apparel division with the purpose of focusing in other core product lines.

==Products==
=== Swiss Army knives ===

The Swiss Army knife is the best-known product by Victorinox. Originally the sole supplier, Victorinox has shared the contract with Wenger since 1908. A compromise between the two companies gave Victorinox the right to advertise as the &quot;Original Swiss Army Knife&quot;, while Wenger laid claim to the title of &quot;Genuine Swiss Army Knife&quot;. Victorinox took over Wenger in 2005.

Swiss Army knives are widely used outside the army (and civil sales represent most of the turnover). They are multi-functional tools, and many sizes and functional combinations are produced. NASA astronauts each have a Victorinox knife at their disposal as &quot;standard equipment,&quot; Victorinox knives have also been taken to Mount Everest and the Arctic as well. The &quot;Champion&quot;, Victorinox&#x27;s flagship model, prior to the introduction of the &quot;SwissChamp&quot; in 1986, is displayed in the New York Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Permanent Design Collection.

=== SwissCard ===
The SwissCard is roughly the size of a business card, typically with a small pair of scissors, a short non-folding knife, a small file with a screwdriver point, a plastic toothpick, tweezers, a slim ballpoint pen, and a straight pin, housed in a hard plastic case of 82 × 54.5 x 4.5 mm in size, with an inch ruler on one side and metric measurements on the other. Victorinox produces three types of SwissCards, the &quot;Classic&quot;, the &quot;Quattro&quot; and the &quot;Lite&quot; model. All three models differ in the number of functions they provide, ranging from 10 (Classic) to 13 functions (Quattro and Lite).

=== Cutlery ===
Victorinox has long produced other kitchen cutlery under their own name and the Forschner brand name. In 2011 Victorinox stopped using the Forschner name and has since manufactured the same knives only with the Victorinox name.

=== Professional knives ===
Victorinox make a range of household and professional (NSF certified) food preparation knives. They offer chef&#x27;s knives, bread, carving, filleting, deboning, paring, Santoku and specialized knives such as a cheese knife. Victorinox models are made with molded plastic handles, wooden handles or riveted handles. Most models have stamped blades, but one series has a forged bolster. They also have no &quot;ricasso&quot; – the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the heel.
Most models use stainless steel blades and one type is also available with ceramic blades.

=== Bayonets ===
Victorinox also produces the Sturmgewehr 90 bayonet for the Swiss Sturmgewehr 90 assault rifle. The bayonet has an overall length of 310 mm and a muzzle ring diameter of 22 mm. The 177 mm long blade is single-edged and it has no fuller. The bayonets were manufactured exclusively for the Swiss Army by both Wenger and Victorinox before the two companies merged.

===Timepieces===
In 1989, Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name &quot;Swiss Army&quot;.

Victorinox has various collections of watches which range from luxury dress watches to rugged diving watches. They feature mechanical and quartz movements. Collections include Infantry, Heritage, Divemaster, Airboss and I.N.O.X. The timepieces are all produced in Switzerland.

In 2014, Victorinox introduced the I.N.O.X. range of watches which it claims are resistant to high levels of shock, including being run over by a tank.

=== Other ===
Victorinox produced a fashion line up until the late 1990s, but retired from this project in 2017.

In 2012, Victorinox licensed its name to luggage manufacturer TRG Accessories to produce branded travel gear and business accessories. Victorinox acquired TRG Accessories from Centric Group in 2014.

A number of Emissive Energy Corps products have been redesigned and rebranded as Victorinox LED flashlights. Most are available with a knurled aluminium body, similar to Swiss Army knives. Similarly, SwissTools are Victorinox&#x27;s multi-tools, i.e. a pair of pliers with other tools folded into the grips. In 2018, Victorinox marketed a perfume under the name &quot;Swiss Army&quot;, and registered &quot;Swiss Army&quot; and &quot;Swiss Military&quot; as trademarks under US law. In October 2018, the Swiss Federal Office for Defence Procurement (Armasuisse) sued Victorinox, demanding the removal of these trademarks from the marketplace. The context of the lawsuit is a 2012 parliamentary motion by state councillor Thomas Minder requesting the active protection of trademarks such as &quot;Swiss Army&quot;, &quot;Swiss Military&quot; or &quot;Swiss Air Force&quot; on the part of the federal authorities. Victorinox argued that it does own the (English-language) trademarks &quot;Swiss Army&quot; and &quot;Swiss Military&quot;.

<text>Ásgrímur Jónsson (March 4, 1876 – April 5, 1958) was an Icelandic painter, and one of the first in the country to make art a professional living.

The subjects of his pictures are mostly the landscapes of his home country, particularly mountains. His painting style is similar to the French impressionists like Corot. Some of his pictures also illustrate Icelandic sagas and folk tales.

He was also noted for his murals in various churches in Iceland. A number of his works are on display in the National Gallery of Iceland. Ásgrímur influenced many artists in Iceland including Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval. A short time before he died he donated his house at No. 74, Bergstaðastræti, Reykjavík to the Icelandic Government along with all those paintings which were at that time in his possession. These consisted of 192 oil paintings and 277 water colours together with a great number of unfinished pictures dating from various periods in his life. His house is now the Ásgrímur Jónsson Collection, part of the National Gallery of Iceland.

During his lifetime Ásgrímur was honoured in many ways. He was made honorary professor at the University of Iceland and, in 1933 he was made Grand Knight of the Icelandic Order of the Falcon. He was an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and Knight of Dannebrog, first class. 

He died in 1958 and was buried on the cemetery of Gaulverjabæjar Church in Flóahreppur.

<text>Rotational symmetry, also known as radial symmetry in geometry, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object&#x27;s degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks exactly the same for each rotation.

Certain geometric objects are partially symmetrical when rotated at certain angles such as squares rotated 90°, however the only geometric objects that are fully rotationally symmetric at any angle are spheres, circles and other spheroids.

== Formal treatment ==
Formally the rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in -dimensional Euclidean space. Rotations are direct isometries, i.e., isometries preserving orientation. Therefore, a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of (see Euclidean group).

Symmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations, so space is homogeneous, and the symmetry group is the whole . With the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be .

For symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the special orthogonal group , the group of orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. For this is the rotation group .

In another definition of the word, the rotation group &quot;of an object&quot; is the symmetry group within , the group of direct isometries; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.

Laws of physics are SO(3)-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of Noether&#x27;s theorem, the rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation law.

===Discrete rotational symmetry===
Rotational symmetry of order , also called -fold rotational symmetry, or discrete rotational symmetry of the th order, with respect to a particular point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D) means that rotation by an angle of (180°, 120°, 90°, 72°, 60°, 51 °, etc.) does not change the object. A &quot;1-fold&quot; symmetry is no symmetry (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360°).

The notation for -fold symmetry is or simply . The actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry, together with the . For each point or axis of symmetry, the abstract group type is cyclic group of order , . Although for the latter also the notation is used, the geometric and abstract should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see cyclic symmetry groups in 3D.

The fundamental domain is a sector of 

Examples without additional reflection symmetry:
*, 180°: the &quot;dyad&quot;; letters Z, N, S; the outlines, albeit not the colors, of the yin and yang symbol; the Union Flag (as divided along the flag&#x27;s diagonal and rotated about the flag&#x27;s center point)
*, 120°: &quot;triad&quot;, triskelion, Borromean rings; sometimes the term &quot;trilateral symmetry&quot; is used;
*, 90°: &quot;tetrad&quot;, swastika
*, 60°: &quot;hexad&quot;, Star of David (this one has additional reflection symmetry)
*, 45°: &quot;octad&quot;, Octagonal muqarnas, computer-generated (CG), ceiling

 is the rotation group of a regular -sided polygon in 2D and of a regular -sided pyramid in 3D.

If there is e.g. rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100°, then also with respect to one of 20°, the greatest common divisor of 100° and 360°.

A typical 3D object with rotational symmetry (possibly also with perpendicular axes) but no mirror symmetry is a propeller.

===Examples===
===Multiple symmetry axes through the same point===
For discrete symmetry with multiple symmetry axes through the same point, there are the following possibilities:
*In addition to an -fold axis, perpendicular 2-fold axes: the dihedral groups of order  (). This is the rotation group of a regular prism, or regular bipyramid. Although the same notation is used, the geometric and abstract should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see dihedral symmetry groups in 3D.
*4×3-fold and 3×2-fold axes: the rotation group of order 12 of a regular tetrahedron. The group is isomorphic to alternating group . 
*3×4-fold, 4×3-fold, and 6×2-fold axes: the rotation group &quot;O&quot; of order 24 of a cube and a regular octahedron. The group is isomorphic to symmetric group . 
*6×5-fold, 10×3-fold, and 15×2-fold axes: the rotation group  of order 60 of a dodecahedron and an icosahedron. The group is isomorphic to alternating group . The group contains 10 versions of and 6 versions of (rotational symmetries like prisms and antiprisms).

In the case of the Platonic solids, the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges, and the number of them is half the number of edges. The other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces, except in the case of the tetrahedron, where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face.

===Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle===
Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle is, in two dimensions, circular symmetry. The fundamental domain is a half-line.

In three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry (no change when rotating about one axis, or for any rotation). That is, no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates. The fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis, and a radial half-line, respectively. Axisymmetric and axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry, or axisymmetry (i.e. rotational symmetry with respect to a central axis) like a doughnut (torus). An example of approximate spherical symmetry is the Earth (with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties).

In 4D, continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2D rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane, about the point of intersection. An object can also have rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes, e.g. if it is the Cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2D figures, as in the case of e.g. the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms.

===Rotational symmetry with translational symmetry===

2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the Frieze groups. A rotocenter is the fixed, or invariant, point of a rotation. There are two rotocenters per primitive cell.

Together with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups, with axes per primitive cell:
*p2 (2222): 4×2-fold; rotation group of a parallelogrammic, rectangular, and rhombic lattice.
*p3 (333): 3×3-fold; &quot;not&quot; the rotation group of any lattice (every lattice is upside-down the same, but that does not apply for this symmetry); it is e.g. the rotation group of the regular triangular tiling with the equilateral triangles alternatingly colored. 
*p4 (442): 2×4-fold, 2×2-fold; rotation group of a square lattice.
*p6 (632): 1×6-fold, 2×3-fold, 3×2-fold; rotation group of a hexagonal lattice.
*2-fold rotocenters (including possible 4-fold and 6-fold), if present at all, form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice, scaled by a factor 1/2. In the case translational symmetry in one dimension, a similar property applies, though the term &quot;lattice&quot; does not apply.
*3-fold rotocenters (including possible 6-fold), if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 30° (or equivalently 90°), and scaled by a factor formula_1
*4-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 45°, and scaled by a factor formula_2
*6-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational lattice.

Scaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor. Therefore, the number of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold, etc.

3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one (or ditto in 3D with respect to parallel axes) implies rotation group p6, i.e. double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point (or, in 3D, parallel axis). The translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is formula_3 times their distance.

<doc id="701099" wikidata="Q1430514" url="?curid=701099" title="Luttinger liquid">
<text>A Luttinger liquid, or Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid, is a theoretical model describing interacting electrons (or other fermions) in a one-dimensional conductor (e.g. quantum wires such as carbon nanotubes). Such a model is necessary as the commonly used Fermi liquid model breaks down for one dimension.

The Tomonaga–Luttinger&#x27;s liquid was first proposed by Sin-Itiro Tomonaga in 1950. The model showed that under certain constraints, second-order interactions between electrons could be modelled as bosonic interactions. In 1963, J.M. Luttinger reformulated the theory in terms of Bloch sound waves and showed that the constraints proposed by Tomonaga were unnecessary in order to treat the second-order perturbations as bosons. But his solution of the model was incorrect; the correct solution was given by and Elliot H. Lieb 1965.

== Theory ==
Luttinger liquid theory describes low energy excitations in a 1D electron gas as bosons. Starting with the free electron Hamiltonian:

formula_1

is separated into left and right moving electrons and undergoes linearization with the approximation formula_2 over the range formula_3:

formula_4

Expressions for bosons in terms of fermions are used to represent the Hamiltonian as a product of two boson operators in a Bogoliubov transformation.

The completed bosonization can then be used to predict spin-charge separation. Electron-electron interactions can be treated to calculate correlation functions.

== Features ==
Among the hallmark features of a Luttinger liquid are the following:

* The response of the charge (or particle) density to some external perturbation are waves (&quot;plasmons&quot; - or charge density waves) propagating at a velocity that is determined by the strength of the interaction and the average density. For a non-interacting system, this wave velocity is equal to the Fermi velocity, while it is higher (lower) for repulsive (attractive) interactions among the fermions.
* Likewise, there are spin density waves (whose velocity, to lowest approximation, is equal to the unperturbed Fermi velocity). These propagate independently from the charge density waves. This fact is known as spin-charge separation.
* Charge and spin waves are the elementary excitations of the Luttinger liquid, unlike the quasiparticles of the Fermi liquid (which carry both spin and charge). The mathematical description becomes very simple in terms of these waves (solving the one-dimensional wave equation), and most of the work consists in transforming back to obtain the properties of the particles themselves (or treating impurities and other situations where &#x27;backscattering&#x27; is important). See bosonization for one technique used.
* Even at zero temperature, the particles&#x27; momentum distribution function does not display a sharp jump, in contrast to the Fermi liquid (where this jump indicates the Fermi surface).
* There is no &#x27;quasiparticle peak&#x27; in the momentum-dependent spectral function (i.e. no peak whose width becomes much smaller than the excitation energy above the Fermi level, as is the case for the Fermi liquid). Instead, there is a power-law singularity, with a &#x27;non-universal&#x27; exponent that depends on the interaction strength.
* Around impurities, there are the usual Friedel oscillations in the charge density, at a wavevector of formula_5. However, in contrast to the Fermi liquid, their decay at large distances is governed by yet another interaction-dependent exponent.
* At small temperatures, the scattering of these Friedel oscillations becomes so efficient that the effective strength of the impurity is renormalized to infinity, &#x27;pinching off&#x27; the quantum wire. More precisely, the conductance becomes zero as temperature and transport voltage go to zero (and rises like a power law in voltage and temperature, with an interaction-dependent exponent).
* Likewise, the tunneling rate into a Luttinger liquid is suppressed to zero at low voltages and temperatures, as a power law.

The Luttinger model is thought to describe the universal low-frequency/long-wavelength behaviour of any one-dimensional system of interacting fermions (that has not undergone a phase transition into some other state).

== Physical systems ==
Attempts to demonstrate Luttinger-liquid-like behaviour in those systems are the subject of ongoing experimental research in condensed matter physics.

Among the physical systems believed to be described by the Luttinger model are:

* artificial &#x27;quantum wires&#x27; (one-dimensional strips of electrons) defined by applying gate voltages to a two-dimensional electron gas, or by other means (lithography, AFM, etc.)
* electrons in carbon nanotubes

<text>In physics and mathematics, continuous translational symmetry is the invariance of a system of equations under any translation (without rotation). Discrete translational symmetry is invariant under discrete translation.

Analogously, an operator on functions is said to be &quot;translationally invariant&quot; with respect to a translation operator formula_1 if the result after applying doesn&#x27;t change if the argument function is translated.
More precisely it must hold that
formula_2

Laws of physics are translationally invariant under a spatial translation if they do not distinguish different points in space. According to Noether&#x27;s theorem, space translational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the momentum conservation law.

Translational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not change the object. For a given object, the translations for which this applies form a group, the symmetry group of the object, or, if the object has more kinds of symmetry, a subgroup of the symmetry group.

== Geometry ==

Translational invariance implies that, at least in one direction, the object is infinite: for any given point p, the set of points with the same properties due to the translational symmetry form the infinite discrete set . Fundamental domains are e.g. for any hyperplane H for which a has an independent direction. This is in 1D a line segment, in 2D an infinite strip, and in 3D a slab, such that the vector starting at one side ends at the other side. Note that the strip and slab need not be perpendicular to the vector, hence can be narrower or thinner than the length of the vector.

In spaces with dimension higher than 1, there may be multiple translational symmetries. For each set of &quot;k&quot; independent translation vectors, the symmetry group is isomorphic with Z&quot;k&quot;. 
In particular, the multiplicity may be equal to the dimension. This implies that the object is infinite in all directions. In this case, the set of all translations forms a lattice. Different bases of translation vectors generate the same lattice if and only if one is transformed into the other by a matrix of integer coefficients of which the absolute value of the determinant is 1. The absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by a set of translation vectors is the hypervolume of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional parallelepiped the set subtends (also called the &quot;covolume&quot; of the lattice). This parallelepiped is a fundamental region of the symmetry: any pattern on or in it is possible, and this defines the whole object. 
See also lattice (group). 

E.g. in 2D, instead of a and b we can also take a and , etc. In general in 2D, we can take and for integers &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; such that is 1 or −1. This ensures that a and b themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. If not, not all translations are possible with the other pair. Each pair a, b defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental domain. The vectors a and b can be represented by complex numbers. For two given lattice points, equivalence of choices of a third point to generate a lattice shape is represented by the modular group, see lattice (group).

Alternatively, e.g. a rectangle may define the whole object, even if the translation vectors are not perpendicular, if it has two sides parallel to one translation vector, while the other translation vector starting at one side of the rectangle ends at the opposite side.

For example, consider a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row a shift of a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, wallpaper group &quot;p&quot;1 (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern on the tile we have &quot;p&quot;2 (more symmetry of the pattern on the tile does not change that, because of the arrangement of the tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to consider as fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one.

In 2D there may be translational symmetry in one direction for vectors of any length. One line, not in the same direction, fully defines the whole object. Similarly, in 3D there may be translational symmetry in one or two directions for vectors of any length. One plane (cross-section) or line, respectively, fully defines the whole object.

== Examples ==

* Frieze patterns all have translational symmetries, and sometimes other kinds.
* The Fourier transform with subsequent computation of absolute values is a translation-invariant operator.
* The mapping from a polynomial function to the polynomial degree is a translation-invariant functional.
* The Lebesgue measure is a complete translation-invariant measure.

<text>Randwick is a suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Randwick is located 6 kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the City of Randwick.

==History==
Randwick was named after the village of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England, birthplace of Simeon Henry Pearce, who became Mayor of Randwick six times. Simeon, who migrated to Australia in 1842, and his brother James who arrived in 1848, were responsible for the founding and early development of Randwick. Simeon built the first stone house in the area in 1848, called Blenheim House, which can still be seen in Blenheim Street. It was neglected for some time in the mid-1900s, but was eventually acquired by Randwick City Council and restored.

Proclaimed as a Municipality in February 1859, and as a City in 1990, Randwick has a rich history and a number of heritage buildings. Another Mayor of Randwick, George Kiss, lived in the house known as Ventnor in the 1870s. A two-storey sandstone house, Ventnor was built by Alderman Edward Dawson in 1859, and is situated on Avoca Street, overlooking Coogee. It is now owned by the nearby Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church (built 1888). Other buildings of note include the St Jude&#x27;s Church group, also on Avoca Street. Originally designed by Edmund Blacket, (who also designed St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney and the University of Sydney), the church was completed in 1865. It was modified by H.M. Robinson in 1889. The rectory next door was built in 1870. The Verger&#x27;s Residence, designed by Thomas Rowe and completed in 1862, was the original Randwick Municipal Chambers. This distinctive building, with its Gothic touches, was followed by the present Randwick Town Hall, which was built further north in Avoca Street in 1881. The church group and Ventnor are listed on the Register of the National Estate.

Further south down Avoca Street is the sandstone building with a tower, built in 1859 as an investment property by William Ellis, one of Randwick&#x27;s first six elected aldermen. After briefly being used as the &#x27;Star and Garter&#x27; Inn by Mrs Elizabeth Shipway, it was later the home of Captain Thomas Watson, who was responsible for commissioning the 1874 statue of Captain James Cook, sculpted by Walter McGill, which still stands at the south side of the building. Captain Watson also heightened the square tower, thus ensuring another distinctive landmark feature of the area.
Close by is another even more imposing building in Randwick&#x27;s heartland - the Prince of Wales Hospital, which started life as the Randwick Asylum for Destitute Children. Opened in 1858, it was partly financed by the legacy of Dr. Cuthill, whose name is commemorated by the adjacent Cuthill Street. The southern wing was added in 1863, by which time over 800 children were being cared for. In 1915 the Asylum buildings were finally deemed unsuitable as premises in which to provide a realistic home life for children, and they were then adapted for WWI use as a military and repatriation hospital. In 1953 the complex was officially renamed as the Prince of Wales Hospital, which continues to grow as a renowned medical facility.

Other noteworthy buildings include private homes like Ilfracombe, Clovelly and Torquay in Avoca Street, and Venice, in Frenchmans Road. The latter was built 1884–84 on part of St Mark&#x27;s Glebe. The land had been leased in 1880 for 99 years to S.Holmes and J.Parsons. The house features Tudor and Gothic elements and has stained glass windows. It has been described as a &quot;comparatively rare and distinctive example of late Victorian Gothic architecture retaining most of its detailing intact.&quot; It has a New South Wales heritage listing.

Another notable home was Sandgate, located in Belmore Road. This sandstone house was built circa 1870 on Crown land purchased by Simeon Pearce in 1853. It was bought by the Federal Government in the 1920s; it was then used as a Red Cross facility for First World War veterans. It was saved from demolition in 1978 and restored by Randwick Council.

The last Gothic mansion left in Randwick is Nugal Hall, located in Milford Street. It was designed by Mortimer Lewis and the southern portion of the house was built in 1853 for Alexander McArthur, a shipping merchant. The house features a staircase with glass dome above; the staircase was built of Mauritius mahogany and cedar. The coach house building at the front was originally a lodge for horse-drawn vehicles. The northern portion of the house was completed by Dr Fred Tidswell who owned the Coogee Bay Hotel. The architect of the northern portion is thought to have been Mortimer Lewis&#x27;s son, Oswald. The Tidswell family owned the house from c. 1880–1903. Frederick Squire Tidswell (1831–1898) and his wife Mary Ann (1836–1912) had nine children including the microbiologist Dr Frank Tidswell (1867–1941) and architect Thomas Tidswell (1870–1950).

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census, there were 28,943 people in Randwick, of which 52.9% were female and 47.1% were male. The most common ancestries in Randwick were 31.1% English, 22.2% Australian and 17.8% Irish. 73.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included 2.4% Mandarin, 1.9% Spanish, 1.5% Greek, 1.4% Portuguese and 1.3% French. The most common responses for religion were 41.0% No Religion, 26.0% Roman Catholicism, 8.1% Anglicanism and 4.9% Judaism. The median weekly household income in Randwick was $2,442, which was 28.5% higher than the national median.

==Commercial area==
Randwick is primarily a residential area. The Randwick Racecourse takes up a large portion in the north-west corner of the suburb. The Prince of Wales Hospital, Royal Hospital for Women, Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital and the Prince of Wales Private Hospital together occupy the Randwick Hospitals&#x27; Campus, a large contiguous campus bounded by Barker Street, Avoca Street, High Street and Hospital Road. A number of teaching and research facilities are also located on the campus. The campus is being expanded under a major project called the &quot;Randwick Campus Redevelopment&quot; project, which will see it expand west to the suburb boundary with Kensington and Kingsford. Prince Henry Hospital is also in Randwick.

The main commercial area is centred on Belmore Road. A range of retail stores are located at Belmore Road along with two shopping centres (Royal Randwick Shopping Centre and Randwick Plaza, which contains a Coles Supermarket) on eitherside of Belmore Road. Avoca Street is also quite popular for commerce, there is the 150-year-old Coach and Horses Hotel. Where the two busy streets meet is the gourmet Cookhouse, a heritage sandstone building with a statue of Captain Cook outside and High Cross Park, with a war memorial. Within one kilometre, Coogee is another retail precinct offering good food services while enjoying the great view of the beach. St Pauls Road junction also wins good fame for its popular restaurants, cafés and recreational facilities. Randwick&#x27;s main entertainment district is The Spot, located in the suburb&#x27;s south-east, which contains the Randwick Ritz cinema, a famous art deco cinema which dates from the 1930s and numerous cafes, bars and restaurants.

==Churches==
* Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church 
* St Jude&#x27;s Anglican Church 
* East Sydney Community Christian Churc, 
* Randwick Presbyterian Church 
* Canvas Church 
* Rhema Church of God

== Sport and recreation ==
Just 6 kilometres east of Sydney&#x27;s CBD, the City of Randwick, once known as the &#x27;Sports Coast&#x27; is home to some 29 km of coastline, 10 beaches and bays and many major recreation facilities. Randwick City is one of the most visited tourist areas outside central Sydney, attracting some 13 million visits each year. The city is home to the Coastal Walkway, Randwick Racecourse, Coogee and Maroubra Beaches, Botany Bay National Park, Centennial Parklands (which includes Queens Park and Moore Park), several top class golf courses and major institutions including the University of New South Wales and the Prince of Wales Hospitals.

A number of well-known sporting teams represent the local area. Since 1882 the Randwick District Rugby Union Football Club nicknamed the &#x27;Galloping Greens&#x27; or &#x27;The Wicks&#x27; have represented the district in the Sydney premier grade rugby competition, the &#x27;Shute Shield&#x27; and play their home games at the picturesque Coogee Oval. The local cricket team Randwick Petersham Cricket Club plays in the Sydney Grade Cricket domestic competition and was formed through a merger between Randwick and Petersham Cricket Clubs.

Randwick is represented in the National Rugby League by the Sydney Roosters, formerly the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club. Junior rugby league teams include the Clovelly Crocodiles, the Coogee Dolphins and Coogee Randwick Wombats.

The former Randwick Post Office building in the centre of Randwick Junction (corner of Alison Road and Avoca Street) is known as Easts House. The building is owned by the Sydney Roosters (Eastern Suburbs Rugby League Club), which has donated the building for use by the Ted Noffs Foundation, for the purpose of providing assistance to troubled youth in the district. There are numerous community or corner parks like Alison Park, Randwick Peace Park, Frank Doyle Park, Fred Hollows Reserve and Writtle Park in the locality of Randwick used for recreational and sporting purposes.

==Schools==

Primary schools in the area include Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, Coogee Public School, Claremont College, Randwick Public School, Coogee Preparatory School, and Rainbow Street Primary. Secondary schools include two systemic Catholic schools, Brigidine College and Marcellin College, a Jewish day school Emanuel School and three state schools, Randwick Boys High School, Randwick Girls&#x27; High School, and the Open High School. Randwick North High School was closed in 2001 and the site was divided between Open High School and Randwick Public School.

There are branch campuses of the University of New South Wales and Sydney Institute of TAFE located on King Street, between the Racecourse and Centennial Park.

==Transport==

Until December 2019, Randwick was only served by buses. The main bus corridor is Belmore Road with buses to Bondi Junction, Coogee, Eastgardens, Maroubra, Sydney Airport and Sydney CBD.

The Randwick Line of Sydney&#x27;s light rail network terminates in the suburb at Randwick station.

<text>Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval (15 October 1885 – 13 April 1972) was an Icelandic painter. He is considered one of the most important artists of Iceland. His son is interior designer Sveinn Kjarval.

==Early life==
Born into poverty, Kjarval was adopted and as a young man worked as a fisherman. He spent his spare time drawing and painting, and learned basic skills from artist Ásgrímur Jónsson. At age 27, with financial support from fishermen and the Icelandic Confederation of Labour, he passed an entrance examination and was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, where he completed his studies. During his time in Copenhagen, he became acquainted with various styles including Impressionism, Expressionism, and Cubism, as well as becoming an accomplished draughtsman. Later, he also took trips to France and Italy.

==Style==
Kjarval was a prolific painter, leaving thousands of drawings and paintings. The paintings vary greatly in style and frequently mix different styles. Although not surreal, some of his works include absurd and symbolist elements, mixing elves and myths into landscape. Many of his works include Icelandic landscapes and lava formations but many of his landscape paintings are partially &quot;cubist&quot; and abstract with his focus on the closest ground rather than the mountains in the background. Later in his life his art frequently also included abstract painting. In 1958, he was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal by the King of Sweden.

==Legacy==
* In Reykjavík, one of three buildings belonging to the Reykjavík Art Museum is called &quot;Kjarvalsstaðir&quot; and presents Kjarval&#x27;s works alongside temporary exhibitions.
* He is depicted on the Icelandic 2000 króna banknote.
* The 1977 debut album &quot;Björk&quot; by Björk includes an instrumental flute tribute to Kjarval, written and performed by Björk

<text>Body snatching is the illicit removal of corpses from graves, morgues, and other burial sites. Body snatching is distinct from the act of grave robbery as grave robbing does not explicitly involve the removal of the corpse, but rather theft from the burial site itself. The term &#x27;body snatching&#x27; most commonly refers to the removal and sale of corpses primarily for the purpose of dissection or anatomy lectures in medical schools. The term was coined primarily in regard to cases in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. However, there have been cases of body snatching in many countries, with the first recorded case dating back to 1319 in Bologna, Italy.

Those who practiced the act of body snatching and sale of corpses during this period were commonly referred to as resurrectionists or resurrection men. Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom, who often worked in teams and who primarily targeted more recently dug graves, would be hired in order to provide medical institutions and practitioners with a supply of fresh cadavers for the purpose of anatomical study. Despite a significant decline in body snatching as a practice, there are contemporary instances of body snatching.

==United Kingdom==
Before the Anatomy Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 75), the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. Dissections, the main way doctors aimed to gain understanding, required fresh corpses. Those who were sentenced to dissection by the courts were often guilty of capital crimes, such as murder, burglary, rape, and arson. However, in 1832, Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Anatomy Act 1832, which gave doctors and medical students the right to dissect donated bodies for education and research purposes. Although this act was created to stop the illegal tradeoff of corpses, it did not provide near enough corpses needed by medical schools annually, which could be up to 500 in number. This led to increased numbers of body snatching in the United Kingdom.

Interfering with a grave was a misdemeanour at common law, and therefore punishable only with a fine and imprisonment rather than penal transportation or execution. However, dissection of these bodies and theft of items within the graves was illegal. This caused the body snatchers to only take the body and leave everything else behind in the grave. Medical students and staff did not ask where the bodies came from. The trade was a sufficiently lucrative business to run the risk of detection, particularly as the authorities tended to ignore what they considered a necessary evil. Body snatchers had a limited period in which they could dig up a body before it began decomposing, so that the body could be embalmed. They had to remain undetectable while exhuming the bodies and transporting them from the gravesites to the medical facilities.

There were several methods used in obtaining a corpse. Once such was digging down to the head-end of the coffin and breaking the top open, using a rope or hook to grab the body by its neck and hoist it out of the coffin. Body snatchers were careful to put any clothing, jewelry, and personal belongings back into the coffin before refilling the hole, and trying to smooth out the gravesite as much as possible to look undisturbed. What distinguished body snatching from grave-robbing was the practice of returning belongings to the gravesite before moving on. Removing belongings from the corpse would make them liable to prosecution.

&quot;The Lancet&quot; reported another method.
A manhole-sized square of turf was removed away from the head of the grave, and a tunnel dug to intercept the coffin, which would be about down. The end of the coffin would be pulled off, and the corpse pulled up through the tunnel. The turf was then replaced, and any relatives watching the graves would not notice the small, remote disturbance. The article suggests that the number of empty coffins that have been discovered &quot;proves beyond a doubt that at this time body snatching was frequent&quot;.

Body snatching became so prevalent in the UK that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body until burial, and then to keep watch over the grave &quot;after&quot; burial, to stop it being violated. Iron coffins, too, were used frequently, or the graves were protected by a framework of iron bars called &quot;mortsafes&quot;, well-preserved examples of which may still be seen in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh.

In relation to body snatching, murder for the purpose of selling the corpses to medical schools also occurred. The term &quot;burked&quot; was coined after William Burke, an Irishman, was found guilty of murdering and selling the bodies of at least 16 people. Burke would pinch the nose of his victims and lay on their chest so that there was no physical damage to the bodies. He was hanged and dissected for his crimes in 1829.

Many laws passed by Parliament covered body snatching or similar practices. The Human Tissue Act 2004 created the first overarching law that required informed personal consent to be needed for body or organ donation within medical facilities.

==United States==
Body snatchers generally worked in small groups, which scouted and pillaged fresh graves. Fresh graves were generally given preference since the earth had not yet settled, thus making digging easier. The removed earth was often shoveled onto canvas tarp laid by the grave, so the nearby grounds were undisturbed. Digging commenced at the head of the grave, clear to the coffin. The remaining earth on the coffin provided a counterweight which snapped the partially covered coffin lid (which was covered in sacking to muffle noise) as crowbars or hooks pulled the lid free at the head of the coffin. Usually, the body would be disrobed–the garments thrown back into the coffin before the earth was put back into place.

Resurrectionists have also been known to hire women to act the part of grieving relatives and to claim the bodies of dead at poorhouses. Women were also hired to attend funerals as grieving mourners; their purpose was to ascertain any hardships the body snatchers may later encounter during the disinterment. Bribed servants would sometimes offer body snatchers access to their dead master or mistress lying in state; the removed body would be replaced with weights.

Although medical research and education lagged in the United States compared to medical colleges&#x27; European counterparts, the interest in anatomical dissection grew in the United States. Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York with several medical schools, were renowned for body snatching activity: all locales provided plenty of cadavers. Finding subjects for dissection proved to be &quot;morally troubling&quot; for students of anatomy. As late as the mid-19th century, John Gorham Coffin, a prominent aptly named professor and medical physician, wondered how any ethical physician could participate in the traffic of dead bodies.

Charles Knowlton (1800–1850) was imprisoned for two months in the Worcester (Massachusetts) County Jail for &quot;illegal dissection&quot; in 1824, a couple of months after graduating with distinction from Dartmouth Medical School. His thesis defended dissection on the rationalist basis that &quot;value of any art or science should be determined by the tendency it has to increase the happiness, or to diminish the misery, of mankind.&quot; Knowlton called for doctors to relieve &quot;public prejudice&quot; by donating their own bodies for dissection.

The body of Ohio congressman John Scott Harrison, son of William Henry Harrison, was snatched in 1878 for Ohio Medical College, and discovered by his son John Harrison, brother of President Benjamin Harrison.

Large, gated, centralized cemeteries, which sometimes employed armed guards, emerged as a response to grave-robbing fears. Gated, &quot;high-security&quot; cemeteries were also a response to the discovery that many old urban and rural burying grounds were found to be practically empty of their human contents when downtown areas were re-developed and old pioneer cemeteries moved, as in Indianapolis.

===Use in medical schools===

The demand for cadavers for human dissection grew as medical schools were established in the United States. This was due to the demand for students to have more first-hand experiences with multiple cadavers, rather than observing dissections on only one specimen. The sudden advances in surgery were what brought on this demand for cadavers for medical school students to learn more about internal anatomy. Between the years of 1758 and 1788, only 63 of the 3500 physicians in the Colonies had studied abroad, namely at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Study of anatomy legitimized the medical field, setting it apart from homeopathic and botanical studies. Later, in 1847, physicians formed the American Medical Association, in an effort to differentiate between the &quot;true science&quot; of medicine and &quot;the assumptions of ignorance and empiricism&quot; based on an education without the experience of human dissection. In addition, the medical community wanted to grow medical student&#x27;s knowledge and improve their education by creating a licensing system to terminate those who only went to medical school for pleasantry. By requiring training in anatomy as a prerequisite, this demanded the need for cadavers for medical school students for their graduation.

==== University of Pennsylvania Medical School ====
The University of Pennsylvania was the first medical school in America in the 18th century. In 1762, John Morgan and William Shippen Jr. founded the medical department of University of Pennsylvania. Shippen put an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Gazette in November 1762 announcing his lectures about the &quot;art of dissecting, injections, etc.&quot; The cost was &quot;five pistoles.&quot; In 1765, his house was attacked by a mob, claiming the doctor had desecrated a church&#x27;s burying ground. The doctor denied this and made known that he only used bodies of &quot;suicides, executed felons, and now and then one from the Potter&#x27;s Field&quot;. Later in the 19th century, this school issued an anatomy law that would be state-wide, which was issued around the statement of grave-robbing. This was due to an organized group of grave robbers in Philadelphia. Senator William James McKnight was the person behind the upbringing of the state-wide anatomy law and was involved in grave-robbing himself after this act was finalized to the public.

==== Boston Medical School ====
In Boston, medical students faced similar issues with procuring subjects for dissection. In his biographical notes, John Collins Warren Jr. wrote, &quot;No occurrences in the course of my life have given me more trouble and anxiety than the procuring of subjects for dissection.&quot; He continues to tell of the difficulty his father John Warren had finding subjects during the Revolutionary War: many soldiers who had died were without relation. These experiences gave John Warren the experience he needed to begin his lectures on anatomy in 1781. His advertisement in the local paper stated the following: &quot;A Course of lectures will be delivered this Winter upon the several Branches of Physick, for the Improvement of all such as are desirous of obtaining medical Knowledge: Those who propose attending, are requested to make Application as soon as possible, as the Course will commence in a few days.&quot; It was dated and signed: &quot;Boston 01/01/1781 John Warren, Sec&#x27;y, Medical Society.&quot;

==== Harvard Medical School ====
Ebenezer Hersey, a physician, left Harvard College £1,000 for the creation of a Professorship in Anatomy in 1770. A year earlier, John Warren and his friends had created a secret anatomic society. This society&#x27;s purpose was to participate in anatomic dissection, using cadavers that they themselves procured. The group&#x27;s name was the &quot;Spunkers&quot;; however, speaking or writing the name was prohibited. Often the group used shovels to obtain fresh corpses for its anatomical study.

Harvard Medical School was established November 22, 1782; John Warren was elected Professor of Anatomy and Surgery. When his son was in the college in 1796, the peaceful times provided few subjects. John Collins Warren Jr. wrote: &quot;Having understood that a man without relations was to be buried in the North Burying-Ground, I formed a party ... When my father came up in the morning to lecture, and found that I had been engaged in this scrape, he was very much alarmed.&quot;

John Warren&#x27;s quest for subjects led him to consult with his colleague, W.E. Horner, professor of anatomy at University of Pennsylvania, who wrote back: &quot;Since the opening of our lectures, the town has been so uncommonly healthy, that I have not been able to obtain a fourth part of subjects required for our dissecting rooms.&quot;

Warren later enlisted the help of an old family friend, John Revere (son of Paul Revere) to procure subjects for dissection. Revere called upon John Godman who suggested that Warren employ the services of James Henderson, &quot;a trusty old friend and servant&quot; who could &quot;at any time, and almost to any number, obtain the articles you desire.&quot;

During this time, there was an intense growth in New England of medical programs, which led to an increase in the need for anatomy cadavers. To keep a good supply of bodies became a difficult endeavor. Students were sent away to Boston to seek subjects by grave-robbing. This caused the public to get involved, and people began to set up grave watchers in graveyards to catch those who were snatching the bodies. This led the students to move to New York to find potential bodies for cadavers, which at this time was not the safest option. People were going to jail and were fined for disturbing the gravesites.

Warren attempted to set up a cadaver provision system in Boston, similar to the systems already set up in New York and Philadelphia. Public officials and burial-ground employees were routinely bribed for entrance to Potter&#x27;s Field to get bodies. Potter&#x27;s Field was a public cemetery. These types of places were favored by medical doctors who were in search of bodies to use for their dissections.

In New York, the bodies were divided into two groups–one group contained the bodies of those &quot;most entitled to respect, or most likely to be called for by friends;&quot; the other bodies were not exempt from exhumation. In Philadelphia&#x27;s two public burying grounds, anatomists claimed bodies regularly, without consideration. &quot;If schools or physicians differed over who should get an allotment of bodies, the dispute was to be settled by the mayor–a high-reaching conspiracy that resulted in a harvest of about 450 bodies per school year.&quot;

These medical colleges were targeted by the general public opposed to body snatching, but the medical colleges fought back. One argument was that the medical colleges tried to see them as doing a good thing for the body, since most of the bodies that were taken were ones who did not have loved ones who grieved for them. These schools also attempted to convince the public that the bodies were from a source on the outside, rather than making it look like they had not got permission to take the body.

===Race and body snatching===
Public graveyards were not only arranged by social and economic standing, but also by race. New York was 15% black in the 1780s. &quot;Bayley&#x27;s dissecting tables, as well as those of Columbia College&quot; often took bodies from the segregated section of Potter&#x27;s Field, the Negroes Burying Ground. Free blacks as well as slaves were buried there. In February 1787, a group of free blacks petitioned the city&#x27;s common council about the medical students, who &quot;under cover of night...dig up the bodies of the deceased, friends and relatives of the petitioners, carry them away without respect to age or sex, mangle their flesh out of wanton curiosity and then expose it to beasts and birds.&quot;

In the antebellum American South, bodies of enslaved workers were routinely used for anatomical study; in one case that has been studied, 80% of the corpses dissected at Transylvania University in the 1830s and 1840s were African American. The ready availability of such bodies was cited as an incentive to enroll by Southern medical schools such as the Medical College of South Carolina. According to Hampden-Sydney, in Richmond, Virginia, &quot;from the peculiarity of our institutions [slavery], materials [anatomical subjects] can be obtained in abundance, and we believe are not surpassed if equaled by any city in the country.&quot; In fact the ready availability of [Black] corpses was cited as a reason why Richmond would be a good place to found a medical school. The largest burial ground for enslaved and free people of color in the United States, the Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground is located in Richmond.

The bodies of criminals about to be executed were routinely requested of authorities for this purpose. In 1859, after John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia, the University of Virginia and Winchester Medical College both requested the cadavers of those about to be hanged. Four, three black (Shields Green, John Anthony Copeland Jr., and Jeremiah Anderson), and one white (John Brown&#x27;s son Watson Brown), were obtained by the latter college. In retaliation, Union troops burned Winchester Medical College in 1862; it never reopened.

In December 1882, it was discovered that six bodies had been disinterred from Lebanon Cemetery and were en route to Jefferson Medical College for dissection. Philadelphia&#x27;s African Americans were outraged, and a crowd assembled at the city morgue, where the discovered bodies had been sent. Reportedly, one of the crowd urged the group to swear that they would seek revenge for those who participated in desecration of the graves. Another man screamed when he discovered the body of his 29-year-old brother. The Philadelphia Press broke the story when a teary elderly woman identified her husband&#x27;s body, whose burial she had afforded only by begging for the $22 at the wharves where he had been employed. Physician William S. Forbes was indicted, and the case led to passage of various Anatomical Acts.

After the public hanging of 39 Dakota warriors in the aftermath of the Dakota War of 1862, a group of doctors removed the bodies under cover of darkness from their riverside grave, and each took some for himself. Doctor William Worrall Mayo received the body of a warrior called &quot;Cut Nose&quot; and dissected it in the presence of other doctors. He then cleaned and articulated the skeleton and kept the bones in an iron kettle in his office. His sons received their first lessons in osteology from this skeleton.

For many years Native American burial sites have been used as a place for body-snatching. The bodies would be removed from their graves in the name of science. Usually the bodies would be removed without consent from relatives, and there was no attempt to reach relatives. When these bodies are removed they are given to museums to be put on display. Even if the tribe or relatives found out about the bodies being on display, they did not have the authority to have the bodies removed and returned. In November 1990 the Native American Protection and Repatriation Act was signed.

During the early 1800s in Michigan the first Indian graves were robbed. Even though it was known at the time that Indian burial sites were considered sacred and should not be tampered with, many still dug up skulls and skeletal remains. During this incident two Indian burial sites were tampered with. In the first site the entire body was taken while in the second the head was cut off. Robert McKain was seen carrying the head back into the barracks with it wrapped in a handkerchief. It was shown that he had previously been accused of taking Indian heads from burial sites to give to paying surgeons.

===Public outcry===
On February 21, 1788, the body of a woman was taken from the graveyard of New York City&#x27;s Trinity Church. A hundred-dollar reward was offered by the rector of the church for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. In the &quot;Daily Advertiser&quot;, many editorial letters were written about the incident: one such writer named Humanio warned that &quot;lives may be forfeit ... should [the body snatchers] persist.&quot; There was cause for concern: body snatching was perceived to be &quot;a daily occurrence.&quot; 

A famous case of body snatching in the United States was the Doctors&#x27; Riot of 1788. On April 13, a group of boys playing near the dissection room window of City Hospital peered in. Accounts vary, but one of the boys saw what he thought were his mother&#x27;s remains or that one of the students shook a dismembered arm at the boys. The boy, whose mother had recently died, told his father of the occurrence; the father, a mason, led a group of laborers in an attack on the hospital, known as In order to control the destruction of private property, the authorities participated in searches of local physicians&#x27; houses for medical students, professors, and stolen corpses. The mob was satisfied. Later, the mob reassembled to attack the jail where some of the medical students were being held for their safety. The militia was called, but few showed; this was perhaps due to the militia sharing the public&#x27;s outrage. One small troop was harassed and quickly withdrew. Several prominent citizens–including Governor George Clinton; General Baron von Steuben, and John Jay–participated in the ranks of the militia protecting the doctors at the jail. Three rioters were killed when the embattled militia opened fire on the mob, and when militia members from the countryside joined the defense, the mob threat quickly dissipated.

To assuage the outraged public, legislation was enacted to thwart the activities of the body snatchers; eventually, anatomy acts, such as the Massachusetts Anatomy Act of 1831, allowed for the legalization of anatomy studies.

Prior to these measures allowing for more subjects, many tactics were employed to protect the bodies of relatives. Police were engaged to watch the burying grounds but were often bribed or made drunk. Spring guns were set in the coffins, and poorer families would leave items like a stone or a blade of grass or a shell to show whether the grave was tampered with or not. In his collection of Boston police force details, Edward Savage made notes of a reward offer on April 13, 1814: &quot;The selectmen offer $100 reward for arrest of grave-robbers at South Burying-Ground&quot;. Iron fences were constructed around many burying grounds as a deterrent to body snatchers. &quot;Burglar proof grave vaults made of steel&quot; were sold with the promise that loved ones&#x27; remains would not be one of the 40,000 bodies &quot;mutilated every year on dissecting tables in medical colleges in the United States.&quot; The medical appropriation of bodies aroused much popular resentment. Between 1765 and 1884, there were at least 25 documented crowd actions against American medical schools.

==Other countries==
===Australia===
In Tasmania, the bodies of William Lanne (1835–1869) and Truganini (1812–1876), considered at the time to be the last Aboriginal Tasmanians (Palawa), were both exhumed from their graves. Lanne&#x27;s head, hands and feet were removed illegally by surgeon William Crowther and members of the Royal Society of Tasmania before he was buried, and the rest of his body was stolen after his burial. Truganini, who outlived Lanne by several years, had wished to avoid his fate and expressly asked to be cremated, but was buried anyway. The Royal Society of Tasmania exhumed her body and put it on display. 100 years after Truganini&#x27;s death, aboriginal descendants finally won the rights to their bodies following many years of petitioning the government, and their remains were cremated and spread in the ocean.

These two instances were not isolated. With the aboriginal Tasmanians being wiped out, other native Australians still faced the same threat of body snatching due to continued intrigue from the colonial British presence. In 1910, 12 aboriginal bodies were stolen from their burial places along the coast, where the natives were forced to settle after being driven away from their ancestral land. The leader of this heist was W.E.L.H. Crowther, an 18-year-old medical student simply seeking the favor of one of his professors. After obtaining the bodies, Crowther and his associates took them back to Melbourne to undergo further examination.

==== Project Sunshine ====
Project Sunshine was launched during the height of the Cold War as a series of multinational studies concerning the danger posed to humans by radioactive isotopes as a result of nuclear fallout. The Australian government became involved in the program during the mid-1950s, and began collecting body parts from citizens during autopsies, including many children, most often without their next of kin consenting or even being made aware. By the time the program ended in the early 1980s, the Australian government had stolen thousands upon thousands of body parts from deceased Australians to be used for research in Project Sunshine.

===Canada===
The practice was also common in other parts of the British Empire, such as Canada, where religious customs as well as the lack of means of preservation made it hard for medical students to obtain a steady supply of fresh bodies. In many instances the students had to resort to fairly regular body snatching.

The first medical school established in Canada was 1822 in Montreal. Body-snatching tended to vary between English and French speaking students. The French speaking students would steal bodies to pay for their schooling while the English speaking students stole bodies for fun and were usually caught. The students who stole the bodies for medical use would use elaborate measures to make sure the bodies could not be identified or found if a search was conducted at their residence. Facial identifiers and scars would be removed from the body so that they could not be identified. Students would make elaborate hiding places for the bodies such as using pulley systems to pull bodies up into chimneys or hide bodies under trap doors so that the bodies would not be found. When trying to find a body the robbers would be selective in that they would choose negroes.

In Montreal during the winter of 1875, typhoid fever struck at a convent school. The corpses of the victims were stolen by body snatchers before relatives arrived from the United States, causing an international scandal. Rewards were offered which students collected to return bodies to the families. Eventually the Anatomy Act of Quebec was amended to prevent a recurrence, effectively ending medical body snatching in Quebec.

===China===
Burial customs were regulated in China as a part of the Great Qing Legal Code in an attempt to mitigate illicit burial practices. These regulations criminalized the mishandling of corpses, including the removal of a corpse. The term &#x27;body snatching&#x27; as it regards China specifically can refer to a variety of rationales and specific cases of corpse removal which range from political to spiritual in motivation:

==== Ghost Marriages ====

A Ghost marriage (Chinese: 冥婚; pinyin: mínghūn; &#x27;spirit marriage&#x27;) is a practice originating in China in which either one or neither of the partners in the marriage is alive. The original purpose of ghost marriages is unclear but it has been utilized as a means of maintaining a family&#x27;s honor and legacy in the event that their unwed relative is deceased. The practice has led to the theft of female corpses in order to arrange illicit ghost marriages and relocate the body. In 2006 there were reports of a resurgence in the northern coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Hebei and Shandong. Although the practice has long been abandoned in modern China, some superstitious families in isolated rural areas still pay very high prices for the procurement of female corpses for deceased unmarried male relatives. It is speculated that the very high death toll among young male miners in these areas has led more and more entrepreneurial body snatchers to steal female cadavers from graves and then resell them through the black market to families of the deceased. In 2007, a previously convicted grave robber, Song Tiantang, was arrested by Chinese authorities for murdering six women and selling their bodies as &quot;ghost brides&quot;.

==== Cremation Quotas ====
The Cultural Revolution in China included a push for funeral reform which mandated the cremation of corpses. The enforcement of this mandate has varied, but there have been instances of body snatching for the purpose of meeting state-mandated quotas for cremation funeral practices. The act of body snatching for the purposes of meeting such quotas has become a lucrative business in China. In 2014 two local funerary practice officials in the Guangdong province of China were arrested for hiring body snatchers to acquire corpses in order to meet cremation quotas.

==== Red Market ====
The Red Market, also known as the Organ Trade refers to the trade of human organs or other body parts with the primary purpose being transplantation.In China the illicit trading of human body parts has led to instances of body snatching for use in the Red Market. In order to meet the demand for transplantations China authorized the use of executed prisoners&#x27; organs. Consent of prisoners or prisoners&#x27; families, though required, has often been unverified in cases of executed prisoners&#x27; organs being harvested leading to accusations of illicit harvesting of corpses and transplantations.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, the former President Tassos Papadopoulos&#x27;s body was stolen from his grave on 11 December 2009.

===India===

For over 200 years, the city of Kolkata, in the north-eastern region of India, has been known to be the center of a network of bone traders who remove skeletons from graveyards in order to sell them to universities and hospitals abroad. In colonial times, British doctors used to hire thieves to dig up bodies from Indian cemeteries. Despite changes in laws, a similar process is going strong today. According to journalist Scott Carney, historically members of the Domar caste, who traditionally performed cremations, were pressed into service processing bones; skeletons were exported from India to be used in anatomy classes worldwide. In the 1850s, Calcutta Medical College processed 900 skeletons a year, but mostly for shipment abroad. A century later, a newly independent India dominated the world market for human bones. 

At their height, in the early 1980s, Calcutta&#x27;s bone factories took in an estimated $1 million a year by digging the graveyards of West Bengal after the mourners had left. In 1985 the Indian government banned the export of human bones after human rights groups raised questions about how the bones were being collected and pointed towards the greater need for institutions to obtain informed consent before remains were used for medical research. However, the human organ trade was only forced underground. 

The Indian government banned the export of human remains in the mid-1980s, but body snatching is still thriving, even if secretly, in many parts of the country as a result of ineffective laws and poverty.

===Republic of Ireland===
In Dublin, the medical schools of the 18th and 19th centuries were on a constant hunt for bodies. The Bullys&#x27; Acre or Hospital Fields at Kilmainham was a rich source of anatomical material as it was a communal burial ground and easily accessed. Soldiers attached to the nearby Royal Hospital were always on the alert for grave robbers mainly because many of their comrades were buried there. In November 1825 a sentry captured Thomas Tuite, a known resurrectionist, in possession of five bodies. When searched, his pockets were found to be full of teeth–in those days a set of teeth fetched £1 (about £50 in 2011). Many other graveyards were targets of the medical students or those who made robbing graves their profession. The largest cemetery in Ireland, Glasnevin Cemetery, laid out in the 18th century, had a high wall with strategically placed watch-towers as well as blood-hounds to deter body snatchers.

===Italy===
The first recorded case of body snatching is attributed to four medical students from Bologna in 1319. At this time, studying the anatomy of a human cadaver was not particularly favored once Rome fell, and it became prohibited by the Church. What was favored was animal dissections at this time. Until the 15th century, it had become legal in Italy to conduct up to two dissections in public per year after the first body-snatching in the 14th century.

===The Netherlands===
In The Netherlands, poorhouses were accustomed to receiving a small fee by undertakers who paid a fine for ignoring burial laws and resold the bodies (especially those with no family) to doctors.

During the 17th century, the period of the Glorious Revolution, medicine in Great Britain and the Netherlands was at the root of body-snatching with the goal of using the corpses to be used for anatomical and physiological learning. Among 17th-century medicine educators at universities the desire to educate the public, in particular, took place in the Dutch Republic of the Netherlands. The Dutch Province of South Holland was home to the Leiden Anatomical Theatre. Leiden Anatomical Theatre was amongst other theatres which was centers of arts and sciences, meeting places for artists and scientists, and places of public function. Leiden&#x27;s contribution represented the model of the innovative academy and its clinical course, inaugurated in 1638, was widely seen as a center of excellence. At Leiden University Peter Paauw (1564–1617) and Francisus dele Boё Sylvius (1614–1672), who were medical professors who used practical skills which became an integral basic part of the academic curriculum under the direction of Otho Heurnius (1577–1652) The anatomical theater developed into a place of universal knowledge and a representation of the macrocosmos as opposed to the microcosmos of the human body. After the death of Heurnius, Joannes van Horne (1621–1670) became the next caretaker for the anatomical theater.

==Contemporary body snatching==
===Argentina===
In 1974, former &quot;de facto&quot; President Pedro Eugenio Aramburu&#x27;s body was stolen by Montoneros.
The organization had already kidnapped and murdered Aramburu in 1970. The corpse was to be held until President Isabel Perón brought back Eva Perón&#x27;s body from Italy. It was also an act of revenge for the previous removal of Evita&#x27;s body. Once Evita&#x27;s body arrived in Argentina, Montoneros gave up Aramburu&#x27;s corpse and abandoned it in a street in Buenos Aires.

In 1986, the hands of Juan Perón were stolen from his grave by unknown persons.

=== Hungary ===
The grave of Communist leader János Kádár (1912–1989) at the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest was desecrated in early 2007. His skull has been stolen along with some of his other bones and his wife Mária Tamáska&#x27;s urn. The act was politically motivated, as a message reading &quot;murderers and traitors cannot rest in sacred ground 1956–2006&quot; (taken from a song by far-right rock band &quot;Kárpátia&quot;) was left nearby. The two dates refer to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (Kádár played a major role in the suppression of the revolution), and the 2006 protests in Hungary (a scandal involving a party widely held to be the ideological successor to that of Kádár). As of 2022, the bones and the perpetrators have not been found.

=== India ===
Though it banned the export of human remains in the mid-1980s, India continues to maintain a robust, if under the table, international trade in human skeletons, as journalist Scott Carney indicates

In 2007, the Indian police discovered a stash of hundreds of human skulls and thigh bones and arrested a gang for allegedly carrying out the practice of body snatching and indulging in bone trade. This gang was arrested after they exhumed dozens of graves from Muslim cemeteries in Burdwan district, and smuggled the skeletons not just to medical institutions in need of cadavers across the world, but also to the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan for use in Buddhist monasteries. Kamal Sah was caught carrying 67 human skulls and 10 bones on a bus in Chhapra, in the state of Bihar, by fellow passengers who had noticed a jagged bone sticking out of a bag beneath his seat. The investigating officer of the incident, Ravinder Nalwa, reported to a Reuters journalist that, &quot;during the interrogation the gang members confessed that the hollow human thigh bones were in great demand in monasteries and were used as blow-horns, and the skulls as vessels to drink from at religious ceremonies.&quot;

Buddhist monks in India likewise admitted that human thigh bones and skulls were used by followers of a Tibetan school of Buddhism. A 2009 report from The National stated that alleged bone smuggler Kamal Sah was identified by civilians in Bihar state and handed over to police with two bags of human skulls and bones. When questioned on the subject, the police refused to acknowledge the authorities failure to stamp out the practice and simply claimed that the police lacked &quot;equipment, manpower and expertise to stop this practice&quot;. The criminal lawyer, Majid Menon, acknowledges that the dire economic conditions for vast numbers of people living in such states as Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, have favored the practice of body snatching till date and given room for bone smugglers to flourish.

According to estimates, 20,000–25,000 human skeletons are smuggled out of India every year through Nepal, China, and Bangladesh. The skeletons reach markets in the US, Japan, Europe and the Middle East, mostly for medical institutions. The price for a complete skeleton in these markets ranges from $700 to $1500 depending on the quality and size. In India, a full skeleton costs around $350 in the open market. Young Brothers, a Calcutta-based bone dealer, sells a human skeleton for $300. While the complete skeletons mostly find their way to medical laboratories mostly in the West, the assorted bones and skulls are used for religious rituals mostly in Hindu and Buddhist-dominated areas. As part of their tantric rituals, many tantrics drink wine in human skulls in places such as Nepal and the state of Assam in India.

And even though to date police have been unable to unearth any irregularity in the skeleton trade, the exporter-turned-moralist, Sanker Narayan Sen, maintains that the people from the Domar caste are often responsible for body snatching and later process the procured cadavers for export. The Government of India had twice earlier banned exports, only to revoke its decision on each occasion. According to the Exporters Association, the CBI in 2014 had once again recently concluded its investigations and submitted a report exonerating such body snatchers and exporters.

===Spain===
In April 2000, the skull of antipope Benedict XIII was stolen from the ruined palace of Argillo in Sabiñán, Spain.
The thieves sent an anonymous letter to the mayor of Illueca asking for ().
The Spanish Civil Guard recovered the skull in September 2000 and found that the thieves were two local brothers who were sentenced in November 2006 to 6-month prison, substituted with .

=== United Kingdom ===
Rare reports of body snatching continue to occur. One prominent case involved the removal of the remains of Gladys Hammond from Yoxall Churchyard near Lichfield in south Staffordshire. Hammond&#x27;s remains were taken by animal rights activists who were campaigning against Darley Oaks Farm, a licensed facility that bred guinea pigs for scientific research. Hammond was the mother-in-law of one of the farm&#x27;s co-owners. After a four-year investigation by Staffordshire Police four leaders of the Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs campaign group (three men: Kerry Whitburn of Edgbaston, John Smith of Wolverhampton, John Ablewhite of Manchester; and one woman: Josephine Mayo of Staffordshire) were jailed for conspiracy to blackmail. The men received 12 years each and the woman received four years. The police said the conspiracy included the removal of Hammond&#x27;s remains, which were recovered by police following information given by one of the four.

=== United States ===
In February 2006, Michael Mastromarino, then a 42-year-old former New Jersey-based oral surgeon and CEO and executive director of operations at Biomedical Tissue Services, was convicted along with three employees of illegally harvesting human bones, organs, tissue and other cadaver parts from individuals awaiting cremation, for forging numerous consent forms, and for selling the illegally obtained body parts to medical companies without consent of their families, and then sentenced to long prison terms. BTS sold its products to five companies, including Life Cell Corporation, of New Jersey, and Regeneration Technologies, of Florida.

There is still a demand for corpses for transplantation surgery in the form of allografts. Modern body snatchers meet this demand. Tissue gained in this way is medically unsafe and unusable. The broadcaster Alistair Cooke&#x27;s bones were removed in New York City and replaced with PVC pipe before his cremation.
The director Toby Dye made a documentary titled &quot;Body Snatcher of New York&quot; about this case in 2010.

==In popular culture==

=== Appearances in film ===
The 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an American science-fiction film, was directed by Don Siegel and demonstrates body-snatching as a loss of personal autonomy where aliens take over the bodies of the main characters loved ones. This allowed for publicity of body snatching and interest in the history of its uses outside a science-fiction context. Body snatching was portrayed in a new way of the moral consequences and surrounding effect it has on the stolen body&#x27;s loved ones. In the film The Doctor and the Devils, Timothy Dalton plays an anatomist who runs Edinburgh&#x27;s School of Anatomy in the 19th century. The characters in this film steal corpses after murdering locals and use them for their medical school: this is the practice of body snatching. In another film involving stealing corpses, I Sell the Dead, Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden play two men who make a living stealing and selling corpses.

=== Literature ===
A famous short story by Robert Louis Stevenson is &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot;, adapted into a film starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. This story accurately portrayed the act of body snatching and common uses in its background, taking inspiration from the Burke and Hare murders with regard to using murder to obtain the bodies for educational purposes. This story and film showed how body snatching was viewed as a dark practice with disturbing elements. Another novel mentioning the idea of robbing a grave is the series by H. P. Lovecraft called The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and Herbert West–Reanimator. One of the main characters Joseph Curwen is a merchant and slave trader who steals corpses of well-known individuals around the world and brings them to Providence to torture them until they share their secrets. This reflects the concept of body snatching as this character secretly removed a corpse from grave sites proving it as an unethical act. In the 1985 novel City of Joy written by French Author and Fulbright Scholar, Dominique Lapierre, one sees how in order to pay for his daughter&#x27;s wedding, the dying rickshaw driver sells his bones for science. Hours after demise and before properly mourned, bone traders come to collect his bones. This provides the metaphorical practice of body snatching where a body is surrender, or stolen, and used for science such as in medical schools.

In Tess Gerritsen&#x27;s 2007 novel The Bone Garden, set in Boston in 1830, the protagonist Norris Marshall, a talented but poor medical student, attempts to pay his college tuition by working as a &quot;resurrectionist&quot;. The main character Injun Joe in the popular literature work The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, takes the opportunity to murder Dr. Robinson when he and Muff Potter are hired by him for body snatching. In Jonathan L. Howards novel Johannes Cabal the Necromancer, the eponymous protagonist practices body snatching. In Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel, A Tale of Two Cities, Jerry Cruncher works as a &quot;resurrection man&quot; stealing bodies to resurrect them in addition to his work as a porter and messenger at Tellson&#x27;s Bank.

=== Music ===
In popular culture, music referencing the act of body snatching includes the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; song &quot;The Resurrectionist&quot; which appeared as a bonus track on &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, the first single from their 2006 album Fundamental. The track is inspired by the book The Italian Boy: Murder and Grave-Robbery in 1830s London by Sarah Wise. (See London Burkers.) The 9th track of leATHERMØUTH&#x27;s album XØ is titled &quot;Bodysnatchers 4 Ever&quot;, and it talks about a man and his lover taking fresh bodies and somehow using them to live forever. The second track on Radiohead&#x27;s 2007 album In Rainbows is titled &quot;Bodysnatchers&quot;. The debut single of experimental band Ralph and the Hexagons, &quot;My Weekend Plans&quot;, is about an attempted act of body snatching, although this is referred to as grave robbing throughout the song. The 6th track of Creature Feature&#x27;s album &quot;It Was A Dark And Stormy Night...&quot;  is titled &quot;Grave Robber At Large&quot;. It is about a stereotypical early 19th century body snatcher, featuring the hook &quot;Death is my business, and business is good!&quot;.

<text>In particle physics, the electroweak scale, also known as the Fermi scale, is the energy scale around 246 GeV, a typical energy of processes described by the electroweak theory. The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the vacuum expectation value formula_1 of the Higgs field (where formula_2 is the Fermi coupling constant). In some cases the term &quot;electroweak scale&quot; is used to refer to the temperature of electroweak symmetry breaking, 159.5±1.5 GeV
. In other cases, the term is used more loosely to refer to energies in a broad range around 102 - 103 GeV. This is within reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is designed for about 104 GeV in proton–proton collisions.

Interactions may have been above this scale during the electroweak epoch. In the unextended Standard Model, the transition from the electroweak epoch was not a first or a second order phase transition but a continuous crossover, preventing any baryogenesis. However many extensions to the standard model including supersymmetry and the inert double model have a first order electroweak phase transition (but still lack additional CP violation).

<text>Douglas Watkins (March 2, 1934 – February 5, 1962) was an American jazz double bassist. He was best known for being an accompanist to various hard bop artists in the Detroit area, including Donald Byrd and Jackie McLean.

==Biography==
Watkins was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States. An original member of the Jazz Messengers, he later played in Horace Silver&#x27;s quintet and freelanced with Gene Ammons, Kenny Burrell, Donald Byrd, Art Farmer, Jackie McLean, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Sonny Rollins, and Phil Woods among others.

Some of Watkins&#x27; best-known work can be heard, when as a 22-year-old, he appeared on the 1956 album &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot; by tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, with Max Roach and Tommy Flanagan.

According to Horace Silver&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to the Nitty Gritty&quot;, Watkins, along with Silver, later left Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers because the other members of the band at the time (Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley and Blakey) had serious drug problems, whereas Watkins and Silver were tired of being harassed and searched by the police every time they went to a gig in a new city and club.

When Charles Mingus briefly ventured over to the piano stool in 1961, he hired Watkins to take over the bass part; &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; and &quot;Tonight at Noon&quot; were the results.

Watkins recorded only two albums as leader: &quot;Watkins at Large&quot; for Transition; and &quot;Soulnik&quot; for New Jazz. The latter, recorded in 1960, with Yusef Lateef, features Watkins on cello with Herman Wright backing him on bass. The cello was an instrument he had started to play only a few days before the recording session.

Watkins died in an automobile accident near Holbrook, Arizona, on February 5, 1962, while traveling from Arizona to San Francisco to meet drummer Philly Joe Jones for a gig.

<text>Alfred Ernest Tysoe (21 March 1874 – 26 October 1901) was an English athlete, and winner of two gold medals at the 1900 Olympic Games representing Great Britain.

== Biography ==
Born in the Old Vicarage, Padiham, near Burnley England, Tysoe ran part-time with the Skerton Harriers running team while still working as a farm labourer.
In 1896, he won the Northern Counties 1000y and one mile titles. His running successes brought him to the attention of Harold Hardwick, founder of Salford Harriers in 1884; in 1897 Tysoe was persuaded to join the Salford club. Within his first year with Salford Harriers, he had won the Amateur Athletic Association Championships in the one and ten miles events at the 1897 AAA Championships.

In 1898, he helped the team to win their sixth National Cross Country championship.

At the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris, Tysoe was a favourite in the 800m, having just one week before the games won the 1900 AAA Championships in 1:57.8. He won easily, beating John Cregan from the United States by 3 yards. He also won a gold medal as part of the British team in the 5000m team race.

This proved to be his last season on the running track. In 1901, he became severely ill with pleurisy and died at his home in Blackpool, aged 27.

He is buried in Layton Cemetery, Blackpool. His gravestone reads: &quot;In loving memory of Alfred Ernest Tysoe. Amateur Champion half-mile runner of the world.

Born 21 March 1874, Died 26 October 1901. &#x27;Brief life is here our portion, brief sorrow, short-lived care. The life that knows no ending, the tearless life is there.&#x27; This stone was erected by the many admirers of this famous athlete, by whom he was held in the highest esteem.&quot;

<text>In particle physics, supersymmetry breaking or SUSY breaking is a process via which a seemingly non-supersymmetric physics emerges from a supersymmetric theory. Assuming a breaking of supersymmetry is a necessary step to reconcile supersymmetry with experimental observations. 

Superpartner particles, whose mass is equal to the mass of the regular particles in supersymmetry, become much heavier with supersymmetry breaking. In supergravity, this results in a slightly modified counterpart of the Higgs mechanism where the gravitinos become massive.

Supersymmetry breaking is relevant in the domain of applicability of stochastic differential equations, which includes classical physics, and encompasses nonlinear dynamical phenomena as chaos, turbulence, and pink noise. Various mechanisms for this breaking have been discussed by physicists, including soft SUSY breaking and types of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

==Supersymmetry breaking scale==

The energy scale where supersymmetry breaking takes place is known as the supersymmetry breaking scale. In the scenario known as &quot;low energy supersymmetry&quot;, in which supersymmetry fully solves the hierarchy problem, this scale should not be far from 1000 GeV, and therefore should be accessible using the Large Hadron Collider and future accelerators. 

However, supersymmetry may also be broken at high energy scales. Nature does not have to be supersymmetric at any scale.

<doc id="701142" wikidata="Q1138909" url="?curid=701142" title="Toy model">
<text>In scientific modeling, a toy model is a deliberately simplistic model with many details removed so that it can be used to explain a mechanism concisely. It is also useful in a description of the fuller model.

* In &quot;toy&quot; mathematical models, this is usually done by reducing or extending the number of dimensions or reducing the number of fields/variables or restricting them to a particular symmetric form. 
* In [[Economic model|economic models]], some may be only loosely based on theory, others more explicitly so. They allow for a quick first pass at some question, and present the essence of the answer from a more complicated model or from a class of models. For the researcher, they may come before writing a more elaborate model, or after, once the elaborate model has been worked out. Blanchard&#x27;s list of examples includes the IS–LM model, the Mundell–Fleming model, the RBC model, and the New Keynesian model. 
* In &quot;toy&quot; physical descriptions, an analogous example of an everyday mechanism is often used for illustration.

The phrase &quot;tinker-toy model&quot; is also used, in reference to the Tinkertoys product used for children&#x27;s constructivist learning.

==Examples==
Examples of toy models in physics include:

* the Ising model as a toy model for ferromagnetism, or lattice models more generally. It is the simplest model that allows for Euclidean quantum field theory in statistical physics.
* Newtonian orbital mechanics as described by assuming that Earth is attached to the Sun by an elastic band;
* the Schwarzschild metric, general relativistic model describing a single symmetrical non-rotating non-charged concentration of mass (such as a perfect spherical mass): a simple relativistic &quot;equivalent&quot; of the classical symmetric Newtonian mass (in fact, the first solution of the Einstein field equations to be developed);
* Hawking radiation around a black hole described as conventional radiation from a fictitious membrane at radius  (the black hole membrane paradigm);
* frame-dragging around a rotating star considered as the effect of space being a conventional viscous fluid;
* the null dust;
* the Gödel metric in general relativity, which allows closed timelike curves;
* the Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, in which general relativistic effects of structure formation are not taken into account.
* the empty universe, a simple expanding universe model;
* the Bohr model of the atom, a &quot;semi-classical&quot; quantum mechanical model of the atom, which can be solved exactly for the hydrogen atom;
* the particle in a box in quantum mechanics;
* the Spekkens model, a hidden-variable theory;
* the primon gas, which illustrates some connections between number theory and physics.

<text>Rebecca Loos (born 19 June 1977) is a Dutch former glamour model and media personality. She first came to public attention following her claims that she had conducted an affair with the married footballer David Beckham, while she was employed as his personal assistant. The allegations led to Loos appearing on several reality television series, magazine covers, and in other media for a few years thereafter.

==Early life and education==
Loos was born in Madrid, Spain, but holds Dutch citizenship. Her father, Leonard Loos Bartholdi, was a Dutch diplomat, and her mother, Elizabeth Loos, is originally from Surrey, England. Loos was privately educated at Runnymede College in Madrid. She is a second cousin of Piers Morgan, who was editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; tabloid newspaper when Loos initially gained media attention.

==Career==
Loos became the personal assistant to former England national football team captain David Beckham when he transferred to Real Madrid in July 2003. Her employment was terminated a few months later and Loos subsequently gave an interview to the British tabloid newspaper &quot;News of the World&quot; in April 2004, alleging that she and Beckham had conducted a four-month affair whilst he was married to his wife Victoria. The claims were never corroborated and were dismissed by Beckham as &quot;ludicrous&quot;, although he did not mount a legal challenge to the story.

Shortly after the newspaper coverage of her alleged affair with Beckham, Loos commenced a career as a media personality. In 2004, she briefly appeared as a hostess on the Dutch TV programme &quot;Shownieuws&quot;.

In October 2004, Loos made a controversial appearance on the reality television programme &quot;The Farm&quot;, a Channels 5 version of the RTÉ show &quot;Celebrity Farm&quot;. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) accused producers of pandering to a &quot;morbid and sordid fascination with farm animals&quot;, while People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Mediawatch-UK demanded the show be taken off the air.

In 2005, Loos appeared on the ITV network reality television show &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot;. The same year, Loos took part in a staged wedding ceremony with American fashion model Jenny Shimizu for the television programme &quot;Power Lesbian UK&quot; to protest against America&#x27;s laws on same-sex marriage. It was broadcast in the United States as &quot;Power Lesbians&quot; on Logo TV. The two had a relationship for a period thereafter. Loos has stated that she is bisexual and &quot;has been ever since [she] was a teenager.&quot;

Loos played for the England Women&#x27;s football team in a Sky TV charity event in 2006. In April that same year, she also ran the London Marathon, and raised more than £7,000 in sponsorship for the British Red Cross. Later, in May, Loos appeared on &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot; alongside James Hewitt, in which she famously received a negative reception from judge Sharon Osbourne.

Loos was a contestant on the Spanish version of &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2007, in which she came third. In November of that year, she appeared in Sky TV&#x27;s &quot;Cirque de Celebrite&quot; in which she was one of two new contestants introduced midway through the series.

In 2008, Loos was a guest on &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot;. In September, she had a part in a Dutch feature film called &quot;Mijn vader is een Detective&quot; (English: My father is a detective). In October, she took part in the Dutch version of &quot;71 Degrees North&quot; (&quot;71 Graden Noord&quot;).

Loos has been featured on the covers of &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Nuts&quot;, &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot; and other men&#x27;s magazines and lad mags.

==Personal life==
Loos met her future husband, Norwegian doctor Sven Christjar Skaiaa, while she was filming &quot;71 Graden Noord&quot;. After becoming pregnant, she relocated to Norway in 2009, and has only made occasional media appearances since then. Loos has stated on her official website that she is now a mother of two sons and works as a yoga teacher and massage therapist.

<text>Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (trading as Bendigo Bank), is an Australian financial institution, operating primarily in retail banking. The company was formed by the merger of Bendigo Bank and Adelaide Bank in November 2007.

Prior to the merger, Bendigo Bank operated nearly 900 outlets across Australia, including over 160 company-owned branches, 220 community-owned Community Bank branches, 100 agencies, and 400 &quot;Elders&quot; outlets. The bank&#x27;s branches were mainly located in Victoria and Queensland. Post-merger, the combined bank operates more than 400 branches, including 25 that were part of Adelaide Bank.

The bank&#x27;s national headquarters are in Bendigo, Victoria with a major office in Adelaide, South Australia and regional offices in Docklands, Melbourne and Ipswich, Queensland.

== History and development ==
The company started in 1858 as a fixed-term (terminating) building society to improve conditions in the Bendigo goldfields during the Victorian gold rush.

At seven years old, in 1865, the company restructured, taking the name Bendigo Mutual Permanent Land and Building Society, which incorporated in Victoria 11 years afterwards. It continued to expand its holdings when, in 1978, it merged with Bendigo and Eaglehawk Star, a building society established in 1901.

Further growth involved the acquisition of the building societies Sandhurst, in 1983, and Sunraysia, in 1985, a merger with Sandhurst Trustees Ltd and the acquisition of Capital and Compass building societies.

In 1982 BBS became the first financial institution in Australia to introduce successfully both Visa credit and debit cards.

1993 saw BBS receive a stockmarket listing. Its growth continued throughout the 90s when it acquired National Mortgage Market Corporation Limited in 1995, a mortgage-manager company focussed on loan introducers and brokers. In that year BBS converted to a bank with the name Bendigo Bank. In 1997, Bendigo Bank acquired Monte Paschi Australia from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, an Italian banking group, for AU$42.255M. Monte Paschi Australia was renamed Cassa Commerciale Australia in the same year.

Bendigo Bank&#x27;s &quot;Community Bank&quot; program began in 1998—the first branches opened in the western Victoria towns of Minyip and Rupanyup on 26 June and the first metropolitan branch in the outer eastern suburb of Upwey on 19 October.

The late 1990s saw a further development when Bendigo Bank and Elders Australia formed Elders Rural Bank, a joint venture company focused on agribusiness and rural Australia. Bendigo Bank was also the first financial institution to introduce a mortgage offset account, now a standard banking product in Australia.

In 1999 the bank formed an alliance involving mutual shareholding with IOOF.

The bank received its operating licence in 2000 and absorbed the First Australian Building Society in Queensland, acquiring a new regional headquarters in Ipswich. That same year saw a A$75 million head office expansion in Bendigo.

In 2002 Bendigo Bank introduced the first &quot;Green Loans&quot; in Australia and formed &quot;Community Sector Banking&quot;, a banking joint venture with the not-for-profit sector.

Three years later, Bendigo Bank built a regional headquarters on Harbour Esplanade in Melbourne, Docklands.

In 2007 Bendigo Bank rejected Bank of Queensland&#x27;s merger/takeover proposal, and merged with Adelaide Bank. The A$4 billion takeover was completed on 30 November. Subsequently, shareholders voted to change the company&#x27;s name to Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited, with the change taking effect from 31 March 2008.

On 11 December 2008, Bendigo Bank&#x27;s new headquarters in Bendigo was completed. The 26th Prime Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, was present at the opening.

On 16 December 2011, Bendigo Bank announced that it had reached agreement with the Bank of Cyprus Group to acquire its 100 per cent owned Australian subsidiary, Bank of Cyprus Australia Limited (BOCAL). The purchase was for an estimated total consideration of A$130 million. It was renamed Delphi Bank. In 2022 BBL commenced a program to absorb the Delphi Bank branding, converting all customer products to Bendigo products and closing or re-branding Delphi branches Bendigo Bank branches.

In April 2013, Bendigo Bank&#x27;s subsidiary &#x27;Oxford Funding&#x27; was rebranded as Bendigo Debtor Finance, offering independent credit assessments and cash-flow solutions to businesses on a national level.

In June 2014, the bank became the first in Australia to adopt an investment policy which shunned fossil fuel investments. &quot;Specifically, the bank does not lend to companies for whom the core activity is the exploration, mining, manufacture or export of thermal coal or coal seam gas.&quot;

On 1 March 2015, a group of credit unions diverged from Cuscal and aligned with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank to form Alliance Bank. The credit unions were AWA Credit Union/Mutual (Geelong, 1969), Circle Credit Co-operative Limited (Deer Park, 1969), Service One Credit Union (ACT, circa 1950), BDCU (Berrima, 1963), and in 2018 NOVA (Newcastle, 1964). Alliance Bank maintains some autonomy, but conducts regulated banking activities through Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. They still market themselves under their original name suffixed with &quot;Alliance Bank&quot; and declare themselves agents of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. In January 2024 at an AWA Mutual Ltd shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger with Beyond Bank Australia Ltd took place on 29 January 2024. The voting process ended with 98% of votes being cast “FOR” the merger. Final regulatory and court approvals are set to conclude on 15 February 2024, leading the way for AWA to end the assocaiation with BBL and merge with Beyond Bank Australia.

== Community Bank program ==
Community banking is based on a &#x27;profit-with-purpose&#x27; model, which means that profits are returned directly to the community that has generated them, after paying branch running costs. The program was a response to the massive closure of bank branches, predominantly in rural areas. Bendigo Bank has since extended the program to major metropolitan areas with existing bank services. 

Since 1998, Bendigo Community Banks have reinvested more than $366 million back into local communities. Funds generated help support emergency and rescue services, such as rural fire brigades and the State Emergency Service (SES), as well as other community needs like buses, defibrillators, aged care facilities, sports parks, hospital wings, and classrooms.

Subsidiaries of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank include Community Bank, Rural Bank, Up, Bendigo Debtor Finance (formerly Oxford Funding), Leveraged Equities, Sandhurst Trustees, Delphi Bank (formerly Bank of Cyprus Australia), and Community Enterprise Foundation.

Bendigo and Adelaide Bank had acquired Wheeler Financial Services which was merged with Bendigo Financial Planning, and also acquired Southern Finance.

<doc id="701158" wikidata="Q1094364" url="?curid=701158" title="Rotating black hole">
<text>A rotating black hole is a black hole that possesses angular momentum. In particular, it rotates about one of its axes of symmetry.

All celestial objects – planets, stars (Sun), galaxies, black holes – spin.

== Types of black holes ==
There are four known, exact, black hole solutions to the Einstein field equations, which describe gravity in general relativity. Two of those rotate: the Kerr and Kerr–Newman black holes. It is generally believed that every black hole decays rapidly to a stable black hole; and, by the no-hair theorem, that (except for quantum fluctuations) stable black holes can be completely described at any moment in time by these 11 numbers:
* mass–energy &quot;M&quot;,
* linear momentum P (three components),
* angular momentum J (three components),
* position X (three components),
* electric charge &quot;Q&quot;.

These numbers represent the conserved attributes of an object which can be determined from a distance by examining its electromagnetic and gravitational fields. All other variations in the black hole will either escape to infinity or be swallowed up by the black hole. This is because anything happening inside the black hole horizon cannot affect events outside of it.

In terms of these properties, the four types of black holes can be defined as follows:
Note that astrophysical black holes are expected to have non-zero angular momentum, due to their formation via collapse of rotating stellar objects, but effectively zero charge, since any net charge will quickly attract the opposite charge and neutralize. For this reason the term &quot;astrophysical&quot; black hole is usually reserved for the Kerr black hole.

== Formation ==
Rotating black holes are formed in the gravitational collapse of a massive spinning star or from the collapse or collision of a collection of compact objects, stars, or gas with a total non-zero angular momentum. As all known stars rotate and realistic collisions have non-zero angular momentum, it is expected that all black holes in nature are rotating black holes. Since observed astronomical objects do not possess an appreciable net electric charge, only the Kerr solution has astrophysical relevance.

In late 2006, astronomers reported estimates of the spin rates of black holes in &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot;. A black hole in the Milky Way, GRS 1915+105, may rotate 1,150 times per second, approaching the theoretical upper limit.

=== Relation with gamma ray bursts ===
The formation of a rotating black hole by a collapsar is thought to be observed as the emission of gamma ray bursts.

== Conversion to a Schwarzschild black hole ==
A rotating black hole can produce large amounts of energy at the expense of its rotational energy. This can happen through the Penrose process inside the black hole&#x27;s ergosphere, in the volume outside its event horizon. In some cases of energy extraction, a rotating black hole may gradually reduce to a Schwarzschild black hole, the minimum configuration from which no further energy can be extracted, although the Kerr black hole&#x27;s rotation velocity will never quite reach zero.

== Kerr metric, Kerr–Newman metric ==

A rotating black hole is a solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equation. There are two known exact solutions, the Kerr metric and the Kerr–Newman metric, which are believed to be representative of all rotating black hole solutions, in the exterior region.

In the vicinity of a black hole, space curves so much that light rays are deflected, and very nearby light can be deflected so much that it travels several times around the black hole. Hence, when we observe a distant background galaxy (or some other celestial body), we may be lucky to see the same image of the galaxy multiple times, albeit more and more distorted. A complete mathematical description for how light bends around the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole was published in 2021.

In 2022, it was mathematically demonstrated that the equilibrium found by Roy Kerr in 1963 was stable and thus black holes—which were the solution to Einstein&#x27;s equation of 1915—were stable.

== State transition ==
Rotating black holes have two temperature states they can exist in: heating (losing energy) and cooling.

==In popular culture==
Kerr black holes are featured extensively in the 2009 visual novel Steins;Gate (also TV / manga), for their possibilities in time travelling. These are, however, magnified greatly for the purpose of story telling.
Kerr black holes are also key to the &quot;Swan Song&quot; project by Joe Davis. They are also a key element in the 2014 film &quot;Interstellar&quot;.

<doc id="701163" wikidata="Q5178987" url="?curid=701163" title="Covenant College">
<text>Covenant College is a private, liberal arts, Christian college in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, United States, located near Chattanooga, Tennessee. As the college of the Presbyterian Church in America, Covenant teaches subjects from a Reformed theological worldview. Approximately 1,000 students attend Covenant each year.

==History==
Founded in 1955 in Pasadena, California, as an agency of the Bible Presbyterian Church, Covenant College and Covenant Theological Seminary moved its campus to St. Louis, Missouri, the following year. Following a split among the Bible Presbyterians, it became affiliated with the Bible Presbyterian Church-Columbus Synod (renamed the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in 1961). In 1964, it separated from the seminary, moving to Lookout Mountain, in Georgia. In 1965, it was the site of the merger between the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. It became and remains an agency of the Presbyterian Church in America after the 1982 merger between the RPCES and the PCA. As such, Covenant stands in the Reformed and Presbyterian traditions.

===Presidents===
* Robert G. Rayburn (1955–1965)
* Marion Barnes (1965–1978)
* Martin Essenburg (1978–1987)
* Frank A. Brock (1987–2002)
* Niel Nielson (2002–2012)
* J. Derek Halvorson (2012–2023)
* Brad Voyles (2023–present)

==Academics==

Covenant College offers liberal arts education from a Reformed Christian perspective. The focus of the college is found in its motto, &quot;In All Things Christ Preeminent.&quot; The purpose of this focus is to ground excellence in academic inquiry in a biblically grounded frame of reference.

The college offers Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts in Teaching, and Master of Education degrees, and academic certificates in Arts Administration, Entrepreneurship, Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, Journalism and Society, Medical Ethics Consultation, Neuroscience, and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).

The college has been accredited since 1971 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

=== Research Institutions ===
The Chalmers Center for Economic and Community Development (established 1999), which is a 501(c)3 non-profit, was founded at Covenant to offer courses and programs in community and economic development in the urban United States and throughout the majority world.

The Brock Barnes Center for Leadership is a new addition to the college, headed by former college President Derek Halvorson. Brock-Barnes &quot;draws on biblical insights, interdisciplinary liberal arts thinking, and the experience of seasoned practitioners to inspire and equip the next generation to lead with excellence.&quot;

== Student publications &amp; clubs ==
Students at Covenant publish a bi-weekly newspaper called &quot;The Bagpipe,&quot; which includes reporting on campus news, events, and local issues as well as art and media reviews, opinions, and more. A satirical version is published annually on April 1 called &quot;The Windbag&quot; with takes on campus life and culture.

Covenant&#x27;s literary magazine is &quot;The Thorn&quot; and has been published annually since 1970. The magazine features creative work from the students, including poetry, short stories, and personal essays.

Covenant also has over forty clubs, including a debate club, fishing club, ultimate frisbee club, paintball club, pre-law club, spikeball club, swing-dancing club, tri-beta club, a pickleball club, and a standup comedy club called &quot;Laugh Track.&quot;

== Faculty ==
Covenant has 64 full-time faculty, 89% of whom have doctorates or other terminal degrees. The student-faculty ratio is 12:1. This ratio allows &quot;personal, small class size.&quot;

Faculty are required to state their agreement with the Westminster Confession of Faith.

==Athletics==
The Covenant athletic teams are called the Scots. The college is a member of the NCAA Division III, primarily competing in the newly created Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) since the 2022–2023 academic year. The Scots previously competed in the D-III USA South Athletic Conference (USA South) from 2013–2014 to 2021–2022; the defunct D-III Great South Athletic Conference (GSAC) from 2010–2011 to 2011–2012 (although its women&#x27;s sports continued until 2012–2013); as an NCAA D-III Independent during the 2009–2010 and 2012–2013 school years; and in the Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2001–2002 to 2008–2009.

Covenant competes in 14 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Former sports included women&#x27;s golf.

Recently, the women&#x27;s volleyball finished the 2023 season with a 35–3 record, a top 25 national ranking, and a trip to the NCAA Division III tournament, where they defeated No. 15 ranked Mount St. Joseph University before losing to No. 7 ranked Emory University in the second round.

The men&#x27;s tennis team has also found much success recently, winning two straight conference titles. In 2023, they finished with an 18–7 record and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history.

==Campus==

The campus is located at the top of Lookout Mountain in Dade County, Georgia, near the city of Lookout Mountain, Georgia and approximately fifteen minutes from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

===Carter Hall===
Carter Hall is the signature building on campus. It was originally named The Lookout Mountain Hotel and was built in 1928 by the Dinkler Hotel Corporation and run by Paul Carter, for whom the building is now named. It has been rumored, although not confirmed, that Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher spent their honeymoon there. It was popularly known as the &quot;Castle in the Clouds.&quot; However, since it was completed less than a year before the Great Depression, the hotel soon went bankrupt. It opened and closed several times prior to 1960, when it shut down for the last time. Bill Brock, the grandfather of the college&#x27;s fourth president, Frank Brock, served on the original board of the hotel.

Both the exterior and interior of Carter Hall are Austro-Bavarian Gothic revival in style. The building has had two towers in its history. The first tower was similar in design to the Frauenkirche (Cathedral of Our Lady) in Munich. Poor maintenance before acquisition by the college required it to be rebuilt. The new tower, though considerably simpler in style, maintains the architectural style of the original tower. Every year, the incoming freshman class will sign their name and graduation year on the walls of the tower.

Covenant College bought the building in 1964, upon relocating to Lookout Mountain. During the first few years of Covenant&#x27;s operation on the mountain, all the functions of the college were contained within Carter Hall. At that time, it housed the chapel, the library, the classrooms, the professors&#x27; offices, dorm rooms, the dining hall, and administrative offices. Today, it has all of these except the library and chapel, as well as a cafe called &quot;The Blink&quot;, the campus bookstore, and the mailroom.

From 2015 to 2017, Carter underwent significant renovations. They included improving the stucco, fixing insulation and moisture issues, and renovating the tower.

Dora Maclellan Brown Chapel

The Dora Maclellan Brown Chapel on campus houses the music and theater department. Chapel occurs on campus three times a week, with various Christian speakers from all around the country.

==Notable alumni==

* Rifqa Bary (2018), religious convert.
* Aaron Belz (1993), poet
* Joel Belz (1962), founder, God&#x27;s World Publications, former publisher, &quot;WORLD&quot; Magazine

<text>Sidney Richard Coleman (7 March 1937 – 18 November 2007) was an American theoretical physicist noted for his research in high-energy physics.

== Life and work ==
Sidney Coleman grew up on the Far North Side of Chicago. In 1957, he received his undergraduate degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology physics department.

Coleman received his Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1962, where he was advised by Murray Gell-Mann. He moved to Harvard University that year, where he spent his entire career, meeting his wife Diana there in the late 1970s. They were married in 1982.

&quot;He was a giant in a peculiar sense, because he&#x27;s not known to the general populace,&quot; Nobel laureate Sheldon Glashow told the Boston Globe. &quot;He&#x27;s not a Stephen Hawking; he has virtually no visibility outside. But within the community of theoretical physicists, he&#x27;s kind of a major god. He is the physicist&#x27;s physicist.&quot;

In 1966, Antonino Zichichi recruited Coleman as a lecturer at the then-new summer school at International School for Subnuclear Physics in Erice, Sicily. A legendary figure at the school throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Coleman was awarded the title &quot;Best Lecturer&quot; on the occasion of the school&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary (1979). His explanation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in terms of a little man living inside a ferromagnet has often been cited by later popularizers. The classic particle physics text &quot;Aspects of Symmetry&quot; (1985) is a collection of Coleman&#x27;s lectures at Erice. A quote from his introduction to the book is worth sharing here:
I first came to Erice in 1966, to lecture at the fourth of the annual schools on subnuclear physics organized by Nino Zichichi. I was charmed by the beauty of Erice, fascinated by the thick layers of Sicilian culture and history, and terrified by the iron rule with which Nino kept the students and faculty in line. In a word, I was won over, and I returned to Erice every year or two thereafter, to talk of what was past, or passing, or to come, at least insofar as it touched on subnuclear theory…These lectures span fourteen years, from 1966 to 1979. This was a great time to be a high-energy theorist, the period of the famous triumph of quantum field theory. And what a triumph it was, in the old sense of the word: a glorious victory parade, full of wonderful things brought back from far places to make the spectator gasp with awe and laugh with joy. I hope some of that awe and joy has been captured here.

Coleman&#x27;s lectures at Harvard were legendary. Students in one quantum field theory course created T-shirts bearing his image and a collection of his more noted quotations, among them: &quot;Not only God knows, I know, and by the end of the semester, you will know.&quot; Despite this acclaim, in 1977 he is quoted as not generally enjoy teaching or mentoring graduate students:

I hate [teaching]. You do it as part of the job. Well, that&#x27;s of course false ... or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. ... But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students. ... Occasionally there is a graduate student who is a joy to collaborate with. Both David Politzer and Erick Weinberg were of this kind, but they were essentially almost mature physicists. They were very bright by the time they came to me. In general, working with a graduate student is like teaching a course. It&#x27;s tedious, unpleasant work. A pain in the neck. You do it because you&#x27;re paid to do it. If I weren&#x27;t paid to do it I certainly would never do it.

In 1989, Coleman was awarded the NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences. That award praised his &quot;lucid, insightful, and influential reviews on partially conserved currents, gauge theories, instantons, and magnetic monopoles—subjects fundamental to theoretical physics.&quot;
In 2005, Harvard University&#x27;s physics department held the &quot;SidneyFest&quot;, a conference on quantum field theory and quantum chromodynamics, organized in his honor.

Aside from his academic work, Coleman was a prominent science fiction enthusiast. He was one of the founders of Advent: Publishers and occasionally reviewed genre books for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;.

He died after a long struggle with Lewy body disease.

<text>In quantum field theory, a tadpole is a one-loop Feynman diagram with one external leg, giving a contribution to a one-point correlation function (i.e., the field&#x27;s vacuum expectation value). One-loop diagrams with a propagator that connects back to its originating vertex are often also referred as tadpoles. For many massless theories, these graphs vanish in dimensional regularization (by dimensional analysis and the absence of any inherent mass scale in the loop integral).
Tadpole corrections are needed if the corresponding external field has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, such as the Higgs field.
Tadpole diagrams were first used in the 1960s. An early example was published by Abdus Salam in 1961, though he did not take credit for the name. Physicists Sidney Coleman and Sheldon Glashow made an influential use of tadpole diagrams to explain symmetry breaking in the strong interaction in 1964.
In 1985 Coleman stated (perhaps as a joke) that &quot;Physical Review&quot;’s editors rejected the originally proposed name &quot;spermion&quot;.

<doc id="701185" wikidata="Q2496679" url="?curid=701185" title="Correlation function (quantum field theory)">
<text>In quantum field theory, correlation functions, often referred to as correlators or [[Green&#x27;s function (many-body theory)|Green&#x27;s functions]], are vacuum expectation values of time-ordered products of field operators. They are a key object of study in quantum field theory where they can be used to calculate various observables such as S-matrix elements. They are closely related to correlation functions between random variables, although they are nonetheless different objects, being defined in Minkowski spacetime and on quantum operators. 

== Definition ==

For a scalar field theory with a single field formula_1 and a vacuum state formula_2 at every event in spacetime, the -point correlation function is the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered products of field operators in the Heisenberg picture
formula_3

Here formula_4 is the time-ordering operator for which orders the field operators so that earlier time field operators appear to the right of later time field operators. By transforming the fields and states into the interaction picture, this is rewritten as
formula_5
where formula_6 is the ground state of the free theory and formula_7 is the action. Expanding formula_8 using its Taylor series, the n-point correlation function becomes a sum of interaction picture correlation functions which can be evaluated using Wick&#x27;s theorem. A diagrammatic way to represent the resulting sum is via Feynman diagrams, where each term can be evaluated using the position space Feynman rules.

The series of diagrams arising from formula_9 is the set of all vacuum bubble diagrams, which are diagrams with no external legs. Meanwhile, formula_10 is given by the set of all possible diagrams with exactly external legs. Since this also includes disconnected diagrams with vacuum bubbles, the sum factorizes into (sum over all bubble diagrams)formula_11(sum of all diagrams with no bubbles). The first term then cancels with the normalization factor in the denominator meaning that the -point correlation function is the sum of all Feynman diagrams excluding vacuum bubbles
formula_12

While not including any vacuum bubbles, the sum does include disconnected diagrams, which are diagrams where at least one external leg is not connected to all other external legs through some connected path. Excluding these disconnected diagrams instead defines connected -point correlation functions
formula_13

It is often preferable to work directly with these as they contain all the information that the full correlation functions contain since any disconnected diagram is merely a product of connected diagrams. By excluding other sets of diagrams one can define other correlation functions such as one-particle irreducible correlation functions.

In the path integral formulation, n-point correlation functions are written as a functional average 
formula_14

They can be evaluated using the partition functional formula_15 which acts as a generating functional, with formula_16 being a source-term, for the correlation functions
formula_17

Similarly, connected correlation functions can be generated using formula_18 as
formula_19

== Relation to the &quot;S&quot;-matrix ==

Scattering amplitudes can be calculated using correlation functions by relating them to the &quot;S&quot;-matrix through the LSZ reduction formula
formula_20

Here the particles in the initial state formula_21 have a formula_22 sign in the exponential, while the particles in the final state formula_23 have a formula_24. All terms in the Feynman diagram expansion of the correlation function will have one propagator for each external leg, that is a propagators with one end at formula_25 and the other at some internal vertex formula_26. The significance of this formula becomes clear after the application of the Klein–Gordon operators to these external legs using
formula_27

This is said to amputate the diagrams by removing the external leg propagators and putting the external states on-shell. All other off-shell contributions from the correlation function vanish. After integrating the resulting delta functions, what will remain of the LSZ reduction formula is merely a Fourier transformation operation where the integration is over the internal point positions formula_26 that the external leg propagators were attached to. In this form the reduction formula shows that the S-matrix is the Fourier transform of the amputated correlation functions with on-shell external states.

It is common to directly deal with the momentum space correlation function formula_29, defined through the Fourier transformation of the correlation function
formula_30
where by convention the momenta are directed inwards into the diagram. A useful quantity to calculate when calculating scattering amplitudes is the matrix element formula_31 which is defined from the S-matrix via 
formula_32
where formula_33 are the external momenta. From the LSZ reduction formula it then follows that the matrix element is equivalent to the amputated connected momentum space correlation function with properly orientated external momenta
formula_34

For non-scalar theories the reduction formula also introduces external state terms such as polarization vectors for photons or spinor states for fermions. The requirement of using the connected correlation functions arises from the cluster decomposition because scattering processes that occur at large separations do not interfere with each other so can be treated separately.

<text>Andrew Taylor Still (August 6, 1828 – December 12, 1917) was the founder of osteopathic medicine. He was also a physician and surgeon, author, inventor and Kansas territorial and state legislator. He was one of the founders of Baker University, the oldest four-year college in the state of Kansas, and was the founder of the American School of Osteopathy (now A.T. Still University), the world&#x27;s first osteopathic medical school, in Kirksville, Missouri.

==Early life and interests==
Still was the son of a Methodist minister and physician. At an early age, Still decided to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a physician. After studying medicine and serving an apprenticeship under his father, he entered the Civil War. He served as a hospital steward assigned to Company F of the Cass County Home Guard of the Missouri Cavalry (Union), but later stated in his autobiography that he served as a &quot;de facto surgeon.&quot;

At the time, the hospital stewards of the Army had many responsibilities, including maintaining hospital stores, furniture, and supplies for the sick. Since pharmacists were not provided for the hospitals, the hospital stewards also filled prescriptions, and when the medical officers were not present, they took care of the patients. Hospital Stewards were sometimes rewarded with promotions to surgeon or assistant surgeon.

In his autobiography, Still says he served in the Civil War in Company F of the 9th Kansas Cavalry. His military service record for the Missouri regiment says that his company was transferred to the 9th Kansas Infantry, not cavalry, but that the transfer was made &quot;without proper authority.&quot; The judge advocate general then orders that these men not be given credit for this unauthorized service.

After the Civil War and following the death of his wife, three of his children, and an adopted child from spinal meningitis in 1864, Still concluded that the orthodox medical practices of his day were frequently ineffective and sometimes harmful. The use of Calomel, also known as mercury chloride, was one such medical practice Still took particular issue with. At the time, there were no standardized dosages for the drug so practitioners of heroic medicine would often deliver dosages that were too large, resulting in mercury poisoning. Still devoted the next thirty years of his life to studying the human body and finding alternative ways to treat disease; his methods involved meticulous anatomical dissection to discover its structure and, therefore, function. This involved exhuming corpses which, while controversial, was a widespread practice among many medical schools in the United States and abroad during that time. During this period, he completed a short course in medicine at the new College of Physicians and Surgeons in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1870. 

Still adopted the ideas of spiritualism sometime around 1867, and it &quot;held a prominent and lasting place in his thinking.&quot;

==Kansas territorial and state legislator==
Still was active in the abolition movement and a friend and ally of the Free State leaders John Brown and James H. Lane. He became deeply embroiled in the fight over whether Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state. The Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 provided that the settlers in those two territories would decide the question for themselves. Civil war raged in Kansas as both sides tried to gain control of the territorial government. In October 1857, Still was elected to represent Douglas and Johnson counties in the Kansas territorial legislature. Still and his brothers took up arms in the cause and participated in the Bleeding Kansas battles (between the pro and anti-slavery citizens). By August 1858, a free-state constitution had been passed; Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861.

==Inventor and patents==
Still was fascinated by machines, and whenever faced with a mechanical problem, his answer was always to devise a better approach. In the 1870s, he patented an improved butter churn. He made improvements to a mowing machine designed to harvest wheat and hay, but before a patent could be submitted, his idea was stolen by a visiting sales representative from the Wood Mowing Machine Co. In 1910, he patented a smokeless furnace burner but had &quot;some difficulty producing a full-sized working model. Heartbroken after his wife, Mary Elvira&#x27;s, death in May 1910, he did not have the will to pursue the matter further, and the invention was never successfully marketed.&quot;

==Baker University==

Still and his family were among the founders of Baker University in Baldwin City in 1858, the first four-year university in the state of Kansas. Still was involved in selecting the location for the site of Baker University&#x27;s first building. Along with his brother, Still donated 640 acres of land for the university campus. While maintaining his medical practice, where he treated patients afflicted with small-pox and cholera, Still spent five years building the facilities.

==Osteopathy==

Still believed that osteopathy was a necessary discovery because the current medical practices of his day often caused significant harm and conventional medicine had failed to shed light on the etiology and effective treatment of disease. At the time Still practiced as a physician, medications, surgery and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey and opium. Additionally, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.

Still sought to reform existing 19th-century medical practices. Still investigated alternative treatments, such as hydropathy, diet, bonesetting, and magnetic healing. Still found appeal in the relatively tame side effects of those modalities and imagined that someday &quot;rational medical therapy&quot; would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery and very sparing use of drugs, including anesthetics, antiseptics and antidotes. He invented the name &quot;osteopathy&quot; by blending two Greek roots &quot;osteon-&quot; for bone and &quot;-pathos&quot; for condition in order to communicate his theory that disease and physiologic dysfunction were etiologically grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.

Still founded the first school of osteopathy based on this new approach to medicine; the school was called the American School of Osteopathy (now A.T. Still University) in Kirksville, Missouri, in 1892.

Still was also one of the first physicians to promote the idea of preventive medicine and the philosophy that physicians should focus on treating the disease rather than just the symptoms.

Still defined osteopathy as: 
In a 1907 interview by the &quot;Topeka Daily Capital&quot; newspaper, A.T. Still&#x27;s son, Charles Still, D.O., described his father&#x27;s philosophy that the body would operate smoothly into old age, if properly maintained and that every living organism possessed the ability to produce all the necessary chemicals and materials to cure itself of ailments.

==Publications==
Still published four books during his life. His first book, published in 1897, was entitled &quot;Autobiography of Andrew Taylor Still with a History of the Discovery and Development of the Science of Osteopathy&quot;. A revised edition of the book was re-published in 1908 after a fire damaged the original printing plates. In 1899, Still published his second book, &quot;Philosophy of Osteopathy&quot;.

Still published his third book, &quot;The Philosophy and Mechanical Principles of Osteopathy&quot;, with publication date 1902, and copyright date 1892. He published &quot;Osteopathy Research and Practice&quot;, his fourth and final book in 1910.

<text>In quantum field theory, the quantum vacuum state (also called the quantum vacuum or vacuum state) is the quantum state with the lowest possible energy. Generally, it contains no physical particles. The term zero-point field is sometimes used as a synonym for the vacuum state of a quantized field which is completely individual.

According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is &quot;by no means a simple empty space&quot;. According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of the quantum field.

The QED vacuum of quantum electrodynamics (or QED) was the first vacuum of quantum field theory to be developed. QED originated in the 1930s, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s, it was reformulated by Feynman, Tomonaga, and Schwinger, who jointly received the Nobel prize for this work in 1965. Today, the electromagnetic interactions and the weak interactions are unified (at very high energies only) in the theory of the electroweak interaction.

The Standard Model is a generalization of the QED work to include all the known elementary particles and their interactions (except gravity). Quantum chromodynamics (or QCD) is the portion of the Standard Model that deals with strong interactions, and QCD vacuum is the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. It is the object of study in the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and is related to the so-called vacuum structure of strong interactions.

==Non-zero expectation value==

If the quantum field theory can be accurately described through perturbation theory, then the properties of the vacuum are analogous to the properties of the ground state of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator, or more accurately, the ground state of a measurement problem. In this case, the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of any field operator vanishes. For quantum field theories in which perturbation theory breaks down at low energies (for example, Quantum chromodynamics or the BCS theory of superconductivity), field operators may have non-vanishing vacuum expectation values called condensates. In the Standard Model, the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking, is the mechanism by which the other fields in the theory acquire mass.

==Energy==

The vacuum state is associated with a zero-point energy, and this zero-point energy (equivalent to the lowest possible energy state) has measurable effects. It may be detected as the Casimir effect in the laboratory. In physical cosmology, the energy of the cosmological vacuum appears as the cosmological constant. The energy of a cubic centimeter of empty space has been calculated figuratively to be one trillionth of an erg (or 0.6 eV). An outstanding requirement imposed on a potential Theory of Everything is that the energy of the quantum vacuum state must explain the physically observed cosmological constant.

==Symmetry==
For a relativistic field theory, the vacuum is Poincaré invariant, which follows from
Wightman axioms but can also be proved directly without these axioms. Poincaré invariance implies that only scalar combinations of field operators have non-vanishing VEV&#x27;s. The VEV may break some of the internal symmetries of the Lagrangian of the field theory. In this case, the vacuum has less symmetry than the theory allows, and one says that spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. See Higgs mechanism, standard model.

==Non-linear permittivity==

Quantum corrections to Maxwell&#x27;s equations are expected to result in a tiny nonlinear electric polarization term in the vacuum, resulting in a field-dependent electrical permittivity ε deviating from the nominal value ε0 of vacuum permittivity. These theoretical developments are described, for example, in Dittrich and Gies. The theory of quantum electrodynamics predicts that the QED vacuum should exhibit a slight nonlinearity so that in the presence of a very strong electric field, the permittivity is increased by a tiny amount with respect to ε0. Subject to ongoing experimental efforts is the possibility that a strong electric field would modify the effective permeability of free space, becoming anisotropic with a value slightly below &quot;μ&quot;0 in the direction of the electric field and slightly exceeding &quot;μ&quot;0 in the perpendicular direction. The quantum vacuum exposed to an electric field exhibits birefringence for an electromagnetic wave traveling in a direction other than the electric field. The effect is similar to the Kerr effect but without matter being present. This tiny nonlinearity can be interpreted in terms of virtual pair production A characteristic electric field strength for which the nonlinearities become sizable is predicted to be enormous, about formula_1V/m, known as the Schwinger limit; the equivalent Kerr constant has been estimated, being about 1020 times smaller than the Kerr constant of water. Explanations for dichroism from particle physics, outside quantum electrodynamics, also have been proposed. Experimentally measuring such an effect is challenging, and has not yet been successful.

==Virtual particles==

The presence of virtual particles can be rigorously based upon the non-commutation of the quantized electromagnetic fields. Non-commutation means that although the average values of the fields vanish in a quantum vacuum, their variances do not. The term &quot;vacuum fluctuations&quot; refers to the variance of the field strength in the minimal energy state, and is described picturesquely as evidence of &quot;virtual particles&quot;. It is sometimes attempted to provide an intuitive picture of virtual particles, or variances, based upon the Heisenberg energy-time uncertainty principle:
formula_2
(with Δ&quot;E&quot; and Δ&quot;t&quot; being the energy and time variations respectively; Δ&quot;E&quot; is the accuracy in the measurement of energy and Δ&quot;t&quot; is the time taken in the measurement, and is the Reduced Planck constant) arguing along the lines that the short lifetime of virtual particles allows the &quot;borrowing&quot; of large energies from the vacuum and thus permits particle generation for short times. Although the phenomenon of virtual particles is accepted, this interpretation of the energy-time uncertainty relation is not universal. One issue is the use of an uncertainty relation limiting measurement accuracy as though a time uncertainty Δ&quot;t&quot; determines a &quot;budget&quot; for borrowing energy Δ&quot;E&quot;. Another issue is the meaning of &quot;time&quot; in this relation because energy and time (unlike position and momentum , for example) do not satisfy a canonical commutation relation (such as ). Various schemes have been advanced to construct an observable that has some kind of time interpretation, and yet does satisfy a canonical commutation relation with energy. Many approaches to the energy-time uncertainty principle are a long and continuing subject.

==Physical nature of the quantum vacuum==
According to Astrid Lambrecht (2002): &quot;When one empties out a space of all matter and lowers the temperature to absolute zero, one produces in a &quot;Gedankenexperiment&quot; [thought experiment] the quantum vacuum state.&quot; According to Fowler &amp; Guggenheim (1939/1965), the third law of thermodynamics may be precisely enunciated as follows:
It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any assembly to the absolute zero in a finite number of operations. (See also.)

Photon-photon interaction can occur only through interaction with the vacuum state of some other field, such as the Dirac electron-positron vacuum field; this is associated with the concept of vacuum polarization. According to Milonni (1994): &quot;... all quantum fields have zero-point energies and vacuum fluctuations.&quot; This means that there is a component of the quantum vacuum respectively for each component field (considered in the conceptual absence of the other fields), such as the electromagnetic field, the Dirac electron-positron field, and so on. According to Milonni (1994), some of the effects attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field can have several physical interpretations, some more conventional than others. The Casimir attraction between uncharged conductive plates is often proposed as an example of an effect of the vacuum electromagnetic field. Schwinger, DeRaad, and Milton (1978) are cited by Milonni (1994) as validly, though unconventionally, explaining the Casimir effect with a model in which &quot;the vacuum is regarded as truly a state with all physical properties equal to zero.&quot; In this model, the observed phenomena are explained as the effects of the electron motions on the electromagnetic field, called the source field effect. Milonni writes: 

The basic idea here will be that the Casimir force may be derived from the source fields alone even in completely conventional QED, ... Milonni provides detailed argument that the measurable physical effects usually attributed to the vacuum electromagnetic field cannot be explained by that field alone, but require in addition a contribution from the self-energy of the electrons, or their radiation reaction. He writes: &quot;The radiation reaction and the vacuum fields are two aspects of the same thing when it comes to physical interpretations of various QED processes including the Lamb shift, van der Waals forces, and Casimir effects.&quot; 

This point of view is also stated by Jaffe (2005): &quot;The Casimir force can be calculated without reference to vacuum fluctuations, and like all other observable effects in QED, it vanishes as the fine structure constant, , goes to zero.&quot;

==Notations==
The vacuum state is written as formula_3 or formula_4. The vacuum expectation value (see also Expectation value) of any field formula_5 should be written as formula_6.

<text>Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar (; 14 March 1742 – 17 June 1797), also known by his regnal name of Agha Mohammad Shah (, ), was the founder of the Qajar dynasty of Iran, ruling from 1789 to 1797 as Shah. Originally a chieftain of the Quwanlu branch of the Qajar tribe, Agha Mohammad Khan was enthroned as the king of Iran in 1789, but was not officially crowned until March 1796, having deposed Lotf Ali Khan of the Zand dynasty in 1794. 

Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar was famously the eunuch Monarch, being castrated as a toddler upon his capture by Adel Shah Afshar, and hence was childless. He was assassinated on 17 June 1797, and was succeeded by his nephew, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar.

Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s reign is noted for the return of a centralized and unified Iran and for relocating the capital to Tehran, where it still stands today. He is noted for his cruel and rapacious behavior, particularly during his Georgia and Kerman campaigns. However, he is also viewed as a pragmatic, calculating, and shrewd military and political leader.

==Early life (1742–1779)==

===Family and youth===

Agha Mohammad Khan was born in Astarabad around 1742. He belonged to the Quwanlu (also spelled Qawanlu) branch of the Qajar tribe. The Qajars were one of the original Turkoman Qizilbash tribes that emerged and spread in Asia Minor around the tenth and eleventh centuries. They later supplied power to the Safavids since the dynasty&#x27;s earliest days. The tribe had several other branches, one of the most prominent ones being the Develu, which often fought against the Quwanlu. Agha Mohammad Khan was the eldest son of the chieftain of the Quwanlu clan, Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and the grandson of Fath-Ali Khan Qajar, a prominent aristocrat executed by the orders of Shah Tahmasp II (possibly compelled by Nader Qoli Beg, who came to be known as Nader Shah after usurping the throne of Iran in 1736, marking the foundation of the Afsharid dynasty). Agha Mohammad Khan had several half-brothers and full-brothers: Hossein Qoli Khan, Morteza Qoli Khan, Mostafa Qoli Khan, Reza Qoli Khan, Jafar Qoli Khan, Mehdi Qoli Khan, Abbas Qoli Khan and Ali Qoli Khan.

When Nader Shah died in 1747, the Afsharid rule of Iran fell apart, which gave Mohammad Hasan an opportunity to seize Astarabad for himself, leading Nader Shah&#x27;s nephew Adel Shah to march from Mashhad to the city in order to capture him. Although he failed to capture Hasan, Adel Shah managed to capture Agha Mohammad Khan, whom he planned to kill. He later chose to spare Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s life and instead had him castrated and thereafter freed. While the common spelling of &quot;Agha&quot; () is usually used as a title roughly translated to &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Mister&quot;, Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s title is differently spelled (), which is a common one among eunuchs who served at the court.

===Death of Mohammad Hasan===
During the following ten years, Afsharid rule in Khorasan suffered heavily from war among rival chieftains and from invasions by the Durrani ruler of Qandahar, Ahmad Shah Durrani. During this period, Mohammad Hasan fought against the Pashtun military leader Azad Khan Afghan and the Zand ruler Karim Khan for suzerainty over the western part of Nader Shah&#x27;s former empire. He was, however, defeated in 1759 by a Zand army. He was betrayed by his own followers and thereafter, killed by his old rival, Mohammad Khan of Savadkuh. Due to Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s castration, his brother Hossein Qoli Khan was appointed as the new chieftain of the Quwanlu instead. Shortly thereafter Astarabad fell under the control of Karim Khan, who appointed a Develu named Hossein Khan Develu as its governor. Meanwhile, Agha Mohammad Khan and his brother Hossein Qoli Khan fled to the steppe. One year later, Agha Mohammad Khan made an incursion against Astarabad, but was forced to flee, chased by the city&#x27;s governor. Agha Mohammad Khan managed to reach Ashraf, but was at last seized and sent as a hostage to Tehran, ruled by Karim Khan. Hossein Qoli Khan was also soon captured and sent to Karim Khan.

===Life at court===

During his stay, Agha Mohammad Khan was treated kindly and honorably by Karim Khan, who made him convince his kinsmen to lay down their arms, which they did. Karim Khan then settled them in Damghan. In 1763, Agha Mohammad Khan and Hossein Qoli Khan were sent to the Zand capital, Shiraz, where their paternal aunt Khadija Begum, who was part of Karim Khan&#x27;s harem, lived. Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s half-brothers Morteza Qoli Khan and Mostafa Qoli Khan were granted permission to live in Astarabad, due to their mother being the sister of the governor of the city. His remaining brothers were sent to Qazvin, where they were treated honorably.

Agha Mohammad Khan was looked upon more as a respected guest in Karim Khan&#x27;s court than a captive. Furthermore, Karim Khan also acknowledged Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s political knowledge and sought his advice on interests of the state. He called Agha Mohammad Khan his &quot;Piran-e Viseh&quot;, referring to an intelligent counselor of the mythical Turanian king Afrasiab in the Shahnameh epic. Two of Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s brothers who were at Qazvin were also sent to Shiraz during this period. In February 1769, Karim Khan appointed Hossein Qoli Khan as the governor of Damghan. When Hossein Qoli Khan reached Damghan, he immediately began a fierce conflict with the Develu and other tribes to avenge his father&#x27;s death. He was, however, killed near Findarisk by some Turks from the Yamut tribe with whom he had clashed. On 1 March 1779, while Agha Mohammad Khan was hunting, he was informed by Khadija Begum that Karim Khan had died after six months of illness.

==Rise to power and unification of Iran (1779–1789)==

===Conquest of Mazandaran and Gilan===

Agha Mohammad Khan took with him a group of loyal followers and left for Tehran. Meanwhile, in Shiraz, people were fighting among themselves. In Tehran, Agha Mohammad Khan met the main chieftains of the Develu clan, with whom he made peace. He visited the shrine of Shah Abd al-Azim, where his father&#x27;s skull was kept. He then travelled to the Mazandaran province, where his first task was to set up his suzerainty among his Quwanlu brothers. This resulted in a clash with his brothers Reza Qoli and Morteza Qoli, whom he defeated on 2 April, conquering Mazandaran. Meanwhile, Morteza Qoli fled to Astarabad, where he fortified himself. Agha Mohammad Khan could not simply storm the city, since starting a war with Morteza Qoli would mean that his frail alliance with the Develu could fall apart—Morteza Qoli&#x27;s mother was a Develu. At the same time, the Zand prince Ali-Morad Khan Zand sent an army of Zand and Afghan troops under Azad Khan Afghan&#x27;s son Mahmud Khan to Mazandaran, which Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s brother Jafar Qoli Khan managed to repel. Agha Mohammad Khan, together with Hossein Qoli Khan&#x27;s sons Fath-Ali Qoli and Hosayn Qoli, was now in a firm position in Babol, the capital of Mazandaran.

In Autumn 1780 Reza Qoli invaded Babol with an army of men from Larijan, where he encircled Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s house and captured him after a fight lasting several hours. When Morteza Qoli learned of this, he marched to Babol on 1 January 1781 with an army of Turkmens and released Agha Mohammad Khan. The three brothers tried to settle their differences; Agha Mohammad Khan and Reza Qoli succeeded, while Morteza Qoli was discontented and fled to Ali-Morad Khan in Isfahan, and then to Sadeq Khan Zand in Shiraz. He died in Khorasan. His former supporters then went to Agha Mohammad Khan and began serving him. At that time, Agha Mohammad Khan had once again become involved in a conflict with his brother Reza Qoli, whom he defeated in several battles, and thereafter established peace with him once more: Morteza Qoli was allowed as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Astarabad and several districts in the region of Hezar Jarib.

Peace did not last long. Ali-Morad Khan soon invaded Mazandaran, which led Agha Mohammad Khan to march from Babol with an army of Mazandaranis and Qajars and attack Ali-Morad Khan, whom he managed to repel from the province. Agha Mohammad Khan then seized Qumis, Semnan, Damghan, Shahrud and Bastam. Furthermore, he also made Hedayat-Allah Khan, the ruler of Gilan, his vassal. He thereafter granted land in Semnan to his brother Ali Qoli as a reward for his help in the conquest of the cities.

===First conflict with the Russians, dispute with Gilan, and the invasion of northern Persian Iraq===

In 1781, the Russian Empire, which was interested in building a trade route with Iran in order to be able to trade with regions deep into Asia, sent an emissary under Marko Ivanovich Voinovich to the coast of Gorgan, where he arrived on 10 August and sought approval to build a trading-post at Ashraf. When Agha Mohammad Khan refused, Voinovich ignored his refusal and went on to establish an interim settlement on Ashurada island. With no ships, Agha Mohammad Khan was unable to retake the island. Instead, he tricked Voinovich and some of his men into meeting him at Astarabad for a banquet on 26 December, where they were held as captives until Voinovich agreed to order his men to leave Ashurada on 13 January 1782.

A year later Agha Mohammad Khan invaded Gilan, because its ruler Hedayat-Allah had changed his allegiance to the Zand dynasty. Hedayat-Allah then sent two diplomats, Mirza Sadeq and Agha Sadeq Lahiji, to Agha Mohammad to make peace. As a precaution he went to Shirvan. The diplomats were unable to come to favorable terms with Agha Mohammad Khan, who raided Gilan&#x27;s capital Rasht and seized its riches. Rejoicing in his victory, he sent his brother Jafar Qoli Khan to conquer the northern part of Persian Iraq. He defeated a Zand army in Ray (or Karaj), and thereafter seized Qazvin. He then marched to Zanjan, which he also seized.In autumn they returned to Mazandaran. In the spring of 1783, Agha Mohammad Khan besieged Tehran, a town under Zand control which had proved troublesome. During the siege, plague started spreading in the town, and thereafter to Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s army camp outside the city, which forced him to lift the siege. He marched back to Ali Bolagh, a summer house near Damghan. Agha Mohammad Khan then returned to Mazandaran and spent the winter there.

===Mazandaran&#x27;s brief submission to the Zand dynasty===
The next year Ali-Morad Khan, in retaliation for Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s attack on Tehran the previous year sent a huge army reportedly numbering 60,000 to Mazandaran in June 1784, aiming to crush the Qajars once and for all. His 15-year-old son Sheikh Veis Khan was put in command of the army, with Ali Morad staying behind in Tehran. When the army arrived in Mazandaran, its people quickly surrendered to the Zands and the nobles defected. Agha Mohammad Khan and a few of his supporters fled to Astarabad, where he tried to fortify the city as much as possible. Meanwhile, Morteza Qoli changed his allegiance and began serving the Zand dynasty. Ali-Morad Khan then sent an army numbering 8,000 under his relative Mohammad Zahir Khan to Astarabad, and laid siege to the city. Agha Mohammad Khan had already stocked provisions in case of a siege. Every day his troops would try to lay waste to the countryside to limit the besiegers&#x27; provisions. This in the end made the besiegers&#x27; situation unsustainable, and allowed Agha Mohammad Khan to leave the city to attack them. Mohammad Zahir Khan fled towards the Karakum Desert, but was captured by Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s Yomut allies and was brutally killed. Only a few of his men managed to survive. On 14 November Agha Mohammad marched from Astarabad into Mazandaran and defeated a Zand force at Ashraf. The Zands were unable to defend Sari and Sheikh Veis Khan fled to Tehran on 23 November.

===First war with Jafar Khan Zand===

Meanwhile, Ali-Morad Khan had raised another group of Zand troops, which he sent to Mazandaran under the command of his cousin Rustam Khan Zand, only to be defeated by Agha Mohammad Khan. Ali-Morad Khan died on 11 February 1785. When Agha Mohammad Khan heard of his death, he went to Tehran to try to capture it. When he reached the city, the inhabitants quickly closed the gates, and told him that they would open the gate only for the king of Iran, who according to them was Jafar Khan Zand, who had succeeded Ali-Morad Khan. Thus Agha Mohammad Khan had to defeat Jafar Khan to be recognized as the king of Iran. He thereafter quickly marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Khan sent men to stop his advance towards the city, but they withdrew at Qom without putting up any resistance. Jafar Khan then sent an even larger Zand army towards Agha Mohammad Khan, who defeated the army near Kashan. Jafar Khan then fled to Shiraz. Agha Mohammad arrived at Isfahan on 2 May, where he discovered what was left of the Zand treasure and Jafar Khan&#x27;s harem. The Qajar troops then looted the city.

During the summer of 1785, Agha Mohammad Khan made the city his headquarters for his expeditions in Persian Iraq. He left Isfahan on 7 July on a campaign in which he managed to bring the Bakhtiari chieftains under his suzerainty. He then left for Tehran on 2 September, appointing a former Zand commander to govern. When he arrived at Tehran, the town finally submitted to him. At the same time, his men captured Hamadan and forced many Kurdish and Turkic chieftains to submit to Qajar rule. On 12 March 1786, Agha Mohammad Khan made Tehran his capital. By then the city had a population of 15,000–30,000 people. It appears that during this period, Agha Mohammad Khan saw himself as the king of Iran, although he avoided using the title &quot;shah&quot;.

Some time later, while Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar was campaigning against the Bakhtiaris, Jafar Khan quickly marched towards Isfahan and re-captured it (although the citadel of Tabrak held out for four months). He then sent troops towards Kashan and Qom, while he marched towards Hamadan in early January 1786. He was, however, defeated by local tribal chieftains, among them Khosrow Khan and Mohammad Hosayn Khan Qaragozlu. Jafar Khan then withdrew to Isfahan to deal with a rebellion by the chiefs of Jandaq, who marched towards the city. The chiefs were defeated and submitted to Jafar Khan. When Agha Mohammad Khan heard about the Zand invasion of Isfahan and its surroundings, he quickly moved towards the city, which made Jafar Khan retreat to Shiraz once again. Agha Mohammad Khan then appointed Jafar Qoli Khan as the city&#x27;s governor. However, the governor of Zanjan revolted shortly afterward, which forced Agha Mohammad Khan to go back north, where he suppressed the latter&#x27;s revolt and pardoned him.

===Second invasion of Gilan===
Agha Mohammad Khan now had to focus on Gilan because Hedayat-Allah Khan had returned to the province (allegedly with Russian help) since the Qajar invasion of the province in 1782. In Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s eyes, the whole Caspian coast was under threat by Hedayat-Allah and the Russians. Agha Mohammad Khan and his men easily managed to enter Gilan. While he was marching towards Rasht, he was joined by a local ruler named Mehdi Beg Khalatbari and other people. Furthermore, the Russian consul in Gilan betrayed Hedayat-Allah by providing weapons to Agha Mohammad Khan. Hedayat-Allah once again tried to flee to Shirvan, but was captured by men sent by a local ruler named Agha Ali Shafti (or another local ruler according to some sources), who killed him to avenge the slaughter of his family a few years earlier. Gilan was now completely under Qajar rule. Besides the conquest of Gilan, the second most valuable thing for Agha Mohammad Khan was Hedayat-Allah&#x27;s treasure.

===Second war with Jafar Khan Zand and enthronement===

Some time later a local ruler named Amir Mohammad Khan, who with another local ruler named Taqi Khan (the ruler of Yazd), had recently defeated Jafar Khan and seized many riches, invaded Qajar territory, and marched towards Isfahan. Jafar Qoli Khan, who was still the governor of Isfahan, left the city before Taqi Khan could reach it and defeated the latter. Agha Mohammad Khan then went southwards once again. He met Jafar Qoli Khan at Isfahan in 1788, and after some time, made Taqi Khan accept Qajar suzerainty, and thereafter punished some Qashqai tribes, who fled into the mountains. Agha Mohammad Khan then approached Shiraz, where he hoped to bait Jafar Khan out of the city, which was strongly fortified, making it very hard to besiege. Unfortunately for him, Jafar Khan remained in the city. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Isfahan, where he appointed his brother Ali Qoli as its governor, succeeding Jafar Qoli Khan. He then left for Tehran.

With Agha Mohammad Khan once again in the north, in autumn Jafar Khan began raising an army to prepare another attack against Isfahan and its surroundings. Jafar left Shiraz on 20 September and marched towards Isfahan. When Ali Qoli learned of it he sent a group of tribesmen to Qumishah, a city south of Isfahan. However, Jafar Khan easily defeated them. Ali Qoli thereafter retreated to Kashan. Jafar Khan was then able to occupy Isfahan on 20 October. Agha Mohammad Khan, learning of this, marched rapidly towards Isfahan, which led Jafar Khan withdraw to Shiraz once again and reached the city on 30 November. Agha Mohammad Khan returned to Tehran rather than attacking Shiraz again. Jafar Khan was murdered on 23 January 1789, which started a four-month civil war between several Zand princes who fought for succession to the throne. In May Jafar Khan&#x27;s son Lotf Ali Khan emerged the victor in this civil war. Lotf Ali Khan fled to Bushehr and managed to recruit the local chiefs of Dashestan to his side. Lotf Ali was able to march against Sayed Morad Khan on 22 April and enter Shiraz on 8 May.

It was also during this period that Agha Mohammad Khan was enthroned (however still not crowned) and named his nephew Baba Khan (who would later be known as Fath-Ali Shah Qajar) as his heir. Thus 1789 is marked as the start of his reign.

==Reign (1789–1797)==
===War with Lotf Ali Khan, family disputes, and the first invasion of Azerbaijan===
====First attack on Shiraz and dispute with Jafar Qoli Khan Qajar====
Now that the Zand dynasty was no longer under the rule of Jafar Khan Zand, Agha Mohammad Khan saw an opportunity to capture Shiraz once and for all. He marched towards the city, and as he neared it, was attacked by Lotf Ali Khan. A battle was fought on 25 June 1789, which ended in Lotf Ali Khan withdrawing to Shiraz while Agha Mohammad Khan followed him and besieged the city. The siege lasted until 7 September. He set up an encampment and returned to Tehran, where he stayed until the end of the ensuing Nowruz. On 17 May 1790, Agha Mohammad Khan once again marched towards Shiraz. When he reached Fars, the governor of Bihbahan acknowledged his authority. Lotf Ali Khan once again left Shiraz in order to stop Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s advance, but the Qajar ruler withdrew to Qazvin and its surroundings, where he had to resolve some problems. Agha Mohammad Khan later quarreled with Jafar Qoli Khan, who saw himself as the best heir of the Qajar dynasty. Agha Mohammad had him executed, which he believed necessary having seen in the Zand family how quickly a dynasty could decline due to disputes over the throne.

====Invasion of Azerbaijan====
While Lotf Ali Khan was having problems with Kerman, Agha Mohammad Khan could thus freely focus on Azerbaijan. He appointed Baba Khan as the governor of Persian Iraq and marched into Azerbaijan in the spring of 1791. He stopped at Tarum, and sent his relative Soleyman Khan Qajar to make the Talysh Khanate acknowledge Qajar authority. Agha Mohammad Khan thereafter went to Sarab, where he forced the Sarab Khanate into submission. He then went to Ardabil, where he subdued the Ardabil Khanate and visited the city&#x27;s shrine. He finally went to Qaradagh, where he brought an end to all resistance against him. He appointed the Donboli noble Hosayn Qoli Donboli as the governor of Khoy and Tabriz.

===Conquest of Fars===

While Agha Mohammad Khan was conquering Azerbaijan, Lotf Ali Khan used the opportunity to attack Isfahan. However Hajji Ebrahim Shirazi, the popular governor of Shiraz, used Lotf Ali Khan&#x27;s absence from the city to stage a coup, while his brother Mohammad-Hosayn Shirazi, who was the Zand ruler&#x27;s general, mutinied along with many other troops. Lotf Ali Khan rushed to Shiraz, but when he arrived at the city, its inhabitants refused to open the gates. He went into the mountains and raised an army large enough to capture Shiraz. Hajji Ebrahim then sent an emissary to Agha Mohammad Khan, asking him to become the ruler of Fars, offering to give him 3,000 mares if he accepted; he immediately did. When Agha Mohammad Khan arrived at Fars, he appointed Hajji Ebrahim as the governor of the whole province, and sent one of his men to take Lotf Ali Khan&#x27;s family to Tehran, and take the possessions of the Zand family. Furthermore, he also ordered Baba Khan to establish a garrison in nearby Shiraz to be prepared to help Hajji Ebrahim if needed.

The Sheikh of Bushehr also took this opportunity to defect to the Qajars, although the reason for doing so is disputed. Sheikh Naser II managed to establish control over Dashtestan, Kharg and Bandar Rig. He also attempted to take Khesht from January to June 1792, but his attempt to capture it failed and he returned to Bushehr on 27 June.

In the meantime, Lotf Ali Khan had defeated the men sent by Hajji Ebrahim and had advanced towards the stronghold of Kazerun in late October and captured it. He then marched to the countryside outside Shiraz and prepared to starve the city. Some time later, the Qajar army from the nearby garrison attacked Lotf Ali Khan&#x27;s men and were winning—until Lotf Ali Khan himself decided to participate in the battle, and the Qajar army was defeated. When Agha Mohammad Khan learned of this, he sent 7,000 horsemen to reinforce Hajji Ebrahim&#x27;s forces, and also ordered the surviving Qajar forces from the nearby garrison to do the same.

Lotf Ali Khan let the reinforcements arrive to Shiraz, expecting that as soon as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim were strengthened, they would come out of Shiraz, and could be overwhelmed in open battle. He was correct in his prediction—a battle shortly took place to the west of Shiraz, where Lotf Ali Khan defeated the united forces of Hajji Ebrahim and his Qajar reinforcements. This took place in late 1791, or early 1792.

The inhabitants of Shiraz now faced extreme hardship from the siege, and it was questionable if they would endure. Large parts of Fars were ravaged by warfare, and for three to four years a pandemic had spread around the landscape. Albeit Lotf Ali Khan&#x27;s forces had gone through as much difficulty as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim whose forces had begun to desert to the Zands. Agha Mohammad Khan thus raised a large army and marched into Fars. On 5 June 1792, Lotf Ali Khan, with a small force of his men, made a bold night raid on Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s encampment near Persepolis.

At first, this choice seemed to be in Lotf Ali Khan&#x27;s favor—he was certain that the Qajars were routed. In his delight at this, he let his men spread out and rest for the night, only to discover at daybreak that Agha Mohammad Khan still held his ground. Lotf Ali Khan then fled to Tabas through Neyriz. Agha Mohammad Khan set foot in Shiraz on 21 July 1792, and stayed there for a month, maintaining his retinue in the Bagh-e Vakil. Before leaving Shiraz, he appointed Hajji Ebrahim as the governor of Fars, and had the body of Karim Khan Zand exhumed and reburied in Tehran, where he went after his stay in Shiraz. Forces were sent to Kerman, Sistan, and Bam (although Qajar rule was not solidified in the last two places).

=== Conquest of Kerman ===
Lotf Ali Khan had fled to Khorasan and received help from the chief of Tabas. With this help, he returned in September and marched towards Yazd. The governor of Yazd sent an army to defeat him, but near Ardakan they fled back to Yazd before an engagement even took place. Lotf Ali then captured Abarkuh and marched towards Bavanat in early October. The Qajar force sent against him wasted time besieging Abarkuh and Lotf Ali captured Stahbanat, Qir, and Neyriz. He marched on Darab and besieged the fortress but was soon informed of the Qajar army sent against him and fled back to Khorasan.

The Afghan chiefs of Bam invited Lotf Ali Khan to return and expel the Qajar yoke. With their help, Lotf Ali Khan returned to Kerman and captured the city on 30 March. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar quickly heard of this and marched towards Kerman on 14 May. The siege lasted four months and took a toll on Kerman&#x27;s population. The city fell on 24 October, and Lotf Ali Khan quickly fled to Bam. However, the chief of Bam gave ordered Lotf Ali Khan to be killed and given to the Quajars. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar took revenge on the people of Kerman by ordering thousands of the inhabitants to be blinded (numbers vary from &quot;ordering to provide 20 000 eyes of the inhabitants&quot; to &quot;7 000 people to be blinded&quot;.) The city was brutally sacked and many beautiful buildings destroyed.

A year later, after the Battle of Krtsanisi brought eastern Georgia and the other principal territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus back within the Iranian domains, he proclaimed himself &quot;Shahanshah&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) on the Mughan plain, just as Nader Shah had done some sixty years earlier.

===Final conquest of Azerbaijan===

===Reconquest of Georgia and the rest of the Caucasus===
The country of Georgia had been under Iranian vassalage for the first time in the early modern era in 1502, and under intermittent Iranian rule and suzerainty since 1555, but had been de facto independent after the disintegration of the Iranian Afsharid dynasty.

For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. Like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, he viewed the territories no differently than those in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever was necessary in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah&#x27;s death and the demise of the Zands. This included putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the &quot;wali&quot; of Georgia.

Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Iran secure, the Iranians demanded the Georgian monarch Heraclius II renounce his treaty with Russia and re-accept Iranian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran&#x27;s neighboring rival, recognized Iran&#x27;s rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius II appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was not listened to, leaving Georgia to fend off the Iranian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan&#x27;s ultimatum.

In August 1795, Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with a 70,000-strong army. This force was divided in three: the left wing was sent in the direction of Erivan, the right one parallel to the Caspian Sea into the Mughan across the lower Aras towards Dagestan and Shirvan, while the Shah headed the centre force himself, advancing towards the fortress of Shusha in the Karabakh Khanate, which he besieged between 8 July and 9 August 1795. His right and left wing forced the Khans of Ganja and Erivan into an alliance. Having abandoned the siege of Shusha due to stiff resistance, which was further aided by Georgian crown prince Aleksandre, the Khan of Karabakh, Ibrahim Khan, eventually surrendered to Agha Mohammad Khan after discussions. He paid a regular tribute and surrendered hostages, though the Qajar forces were still denied entrance to Shusha. Since the main objective was Georgia, Agha Mohammad Khan was willing to have Karabakh secured by this agreement for now, for he and his army subsequently moved further. While at Ganja, having secured Shirvan, he was joined by Javad Khan Qajar and the rest of his right wing contingent. At Ganja, Mohammad Khan sent Heraclius II his last ultimatum, which he received in September 1795:

According to the author of the &quot;Fārsnāma-ye Nāṣeri&quot;, Ḥasan-e Fasāʼi, a contemporary Qajar era historian, Agha Mohammad Khan had declared in the letter:

His advisors divided, Heraclius II ignored the ultimatum but sent couriers to St.Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Heraclius II to avoid &quot;expense and fuss&quot;, while Heraclius II, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians.

At the same time, Agha Mohammad Khan marched directly on Tbilisi, with half of the army he crossed the Aras river. Some estimate his army had 40,000 men instead of 35,000. They attacked the heavily fortified Georgian positions of Heraclius II and Solomon on the southwestern limits of the city. Abandoned by several of his nobles, Heraclius II managed to mobilize around 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 auxiliaries from the neighbouring Imereti under its King Solomon II, a member of the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty and thus distantly related to Heraclius II. The Georgians offered a desperate resistance and succeeded in rolling back a series of Iranian attacks on 9 and 10 September. After that, it is said that some traitors informed the Iranians that the Georgians had no more strength to fight and the Qajar army cancelled their plan of returning to Iran. Early on 11 September, Agha Mohammad Khan personally led an all-out offensive against the Georgians. Amid an artillery duel and a fierce cavalry charge, the Iranians managed to cross the Kura River and outflanked the decimated Georgian army. Heraclius II attempted to mount a counterattack, but he had to retreat to the last available positions in the outskirts of Tbilisi. By nightfall, the Georgian forces had been exhausted and almost completely destroyed. The last surviving Georgian artillery briefly held the advancing Iranians to allow Heraclius II and his retinue of some 150 men to escape through the city to the mountains. The fighting continued in the streets of Tbilisi and at the fortress of Narikala. In a few hours, Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital, which was then completely sacked and its population massacred. The Iranian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off some 15,000 captives. The Georgians had lost 4,000 men in the battle, the Iranians 13,000; a third of their total force.

An eyewitness, having entered the city several days the bulk of the Iranian troops had withdrawn, described what he saw:

===Conquest of Khorasan===
Agha Mohammad Shah now focused on Khorasan, which was under the rule of Nader Shah&#x27;s blind and old grandson Shahrokh Shah. He had earlier been a vassal of the Durrani ruler, Ahmad Shah, but after the latter&#x27;s death in 1772 had become a pawn of the chieftains who had taken control of the surrounding cities and towns of the Afsharid capital of Mashhad. The most prominent of these chieftains was most likely Eshaq Khan, who preserved Torbat-e Heydarieh as his center of operations. In the eastern parts of the Alborz, Kurdish chieftains ruled over several fortresses, such as Bojnord and Quchan. 

Agha Mohammad Shah first marched to Astarabad, and penalized the Turkmens who had been pillaging the city and its surroundings. He then continued to Mashhad, where the local chieftains, who knew it was hopeless to resist, swiftly acknowledged his rule. Agha Mohammad Shah also demanded these local chieftains to dispatch him hostages, who were sent to Tehran. When Agha Mohammad Shah reached Mashhad, Shahrokh, along with a prominent &quot;mujtahid&quot; named Mirza Mehdi, went to the Qajar encampment. There they were warmly received by Agha Mohammad Shah&#x27;s nephew Hossein Qoli Khan.

Shortly afterwards, Agha Mohammad Shah sent a force of 8,000 soldiers under Soleyman Khan Qajar, followed by Mirza Mehdi, to conquer Mashhad and affirm its citizens of the Shah&#x27;s generosity. A day later, Agha Mohammad Shah, followed the customary of the famous Iranian shah Abbas I the Great, and entered Mashhad on 14 May by foot as a pilgrim to the Imam Reza shrine, whilst being teary eyed and kissing the ground. His pilgrimage continued for 23 days, where he seemed to be unaware of the politics of the country.

====The torture of Shahrokh Shah====
However, things quickly changed. Agha Mohammad Shah ordered the exhumation of Nader Shah&#x27;s corpse, and had it sent to Tehran, where it was reburied alongside Karim Khan Zand&#x27;s corpse. He then forced Shahrokh to give him any riches that originally belonged to Nader Shah. Shahrokh swore that he did not possess any more of Nader Shah&#x27;s riches. Agha Mohammad Shah, ruthless and revengeful, and with a desire for treasure, did not believe him. He had Shahrokh Shah hurt severely to confess the hidden locations of the last gems that had passed down to him from his grandfather. Shahrokh, however, refused to speak. Agha Mohammad Shah was personally involved in the torture and on one occasion he had Shahrokh tied to a chair, his head shaved and a crown of thick paste built on his head. He then poured a jug of molten lead into the crown. A number of Shahrokh&#x27;s servants, who were struck with misery for their previous monarch, sent an admired mullah of the city to make an emotional appeal to Agha Mohammad Shah in support of Shahrokh and Shahrokh was sent to Mazandaran with his family. Shahrokh died at Damghan due to the injuries he had suffered during his torture.

===Rest of reign===
Agha Mohammad Khan restored Iran to a unity it had not had since Karim Khan. He reunited the territory of contemporary Iran and the Caucasus region which had been part of the concept of Iran for centuries. He was, however, a man of extreme violence who killed almost all who could threaten his hold on power, a trait he showed in several of his campaigns. A year after Agha Mohammad Khan re-subjugated the Caucasus, he also captured Khorasan. Shah Rukh, ruler of Khorasan and grandson of Nader Shah, was tortured to death because Agha Mohammad Khan thought that he knew of Nadir&#x27;s legendary treasures.

In 1786, Agha Mohammad Khan moved his capital from Sari in his home province of Mazandaran to Tehran. He was the first Iranian ruler to make Tehran—the successor to the great city of Ray—his capital, although both the Safavids and the Zands had expanded the town and built palaces there. One of the main reasons noted for moving the capital farther south was to remain in close reach of Azarbaijan and Iran&#x27;s integral Caucasian territories in the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, at that time not yet ceded to Imperial Russia, their fate in the course of the 19th century. He was formally crowned in 1796 and founded the Qajar dynasty.

Although the Russians briefly took and occupied Derbent and Baku during the expedition of 1796 under the command of count Valerian Zubov, Agha Mohammad Khan successfully expanded Iranian influence into the Caucasus, reasserting Iranian sovereignty over its former dependencies in the region. He was, however, a notoriously cruel ruler, who reduced Tbilisi to ashes, while massacring and carrying away its Christian population, much as he had done with his Muslim subjects. He based his strength on tribal manpower like Genghis Khan, Timur and Nader Shah.

===Death===
Agha Mohammad&#x27;s successful reign was short-lived, as he was assassinated in 1797 in his tent in the city of Shusha, the capital of the Karabakh Khanate, three days after he had taken the city, and less than three years after he had taken power. According to Hasan-e Fasa&#x27;i&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Farsnama-ye Naseri&quot;, during Agha Mohammad&#x27;s stay in Shusha, one night a quarrel arose between a Georgian servant named Sadegh Gorji and the valet Khodadad Esfahani. They raised their voices to such a pitch that the shah became angry and ordered both to be executed. Sadeq Khan Shaqaqi, a prominent emir, interceded on their behalf, but was not listened to. The shah, however, ordered their execution to be postponed until Saturday, as this happened to be the evening of Friday (the Islamic holy day), and ordered them back to their duties in the royal pavilion, unfettered and unchained, awaiting their execution the next day. From experience, however, they knew that the King would keep to what he had ordered, and, having no hope, they turned to boldness. When the shah was sleeping, they were joined by the valet Abbas Mazandarani, who was in the plot with them, and the three invaded the royal pavilion and with dagger and knife murdered the shah.

His nephew, crowned as Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, succeeded him.

== Personality and appearance ==
Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s castration at the age of six had left him permanently damaged, both physically and mentally. His body was sick and weak. He had epilepsy and fell unconscious for three days in 1790/91 due to a stroke. Regardless, he was a determined figure and attempted to hide his frailty. Due to his small stature, he could be mistaken for a young boy from a far enough distance. This seemingly annoyed him to a great extent, especially if a person kept looking at him.

He was interested in hunting and literature. During the night when Agha Mohammad Khan was on his bed, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot; would be read aloud to him.

==Government==

===The bureaucracy===
The bureaucracy remained small during the reign of Agha Mohammad Shah—apart from the grand vizier, the leading figures of the administration were the chief revenue officer (&quot;mustaufī&quot;) and the muster-master (&quot;lashkarnevīs&quot;) of the army. Only one person occupied each post during Agha Mohammad Shah&#x27;s reign; Hajji Ebrahim, who served as grand vizier; Mirza Ismail, who served as the chief revenue officer, and Mirza Asad-Allah Nuri, who served as muster-master. Since Agha Mohammad Shah was primarily busy with his military expeditions, his court was constantly his camp, and Hajji Ebrahim, along with other officials, usually participated in his campaigns.

===Provincial administration===

During Agha Mohammad Shah&#x27;s reign, provincial administration followed the same model of the Safavid one; &quot;beglerbegis&quot; were appointed to govern provinces. A city was under the rule of a &quot;kalantar&quot; and &quot;darugha&quot;, while its quarters was under the rule of the &quot;kadkhuda&quot;. Governorship of provinces went for the most part to tribal chieftains—this was later changed by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, who appointed many of his relatives as governors.

===Military===
Agha Mohammad Shah was more of a military leader than politician, and was known for his determined sovereignty, instead of a charismatic one. His military prowess was highly noticeable—Malcolm&#x27;s evaluation, which was written some years after his death, says the following: &quot;His army was inured to fatigue, and regularly paid; he had introduced excellent arrangement into all its Departments, and his known severity occasioned the utmost alacrity and promptness in the execution of orders, and had he lived a few more years, it is difficult to conjecture the progress of his arms.&quot;

The Scottish traveller James Baillie Fraser also says the following thing about him: &quot;Agha Mohammad had likewise the talent of forming good and brave troops. His active and ambitious disposition kept his army constantly engaged; and they acquired a veteran hardihood and expertness, that rendered them superior to any other Asiatic troops.&quot;

===Construction===
Agha Mohammad Shah did not construct or repair much during his reign, due to the campaigns and battles which occupied his time. In Tehran, he ordered the creation of a mosque named the Masjid-e Shah (meaning &quot;the Shah&#x27;s mosque&quot;), while in Mashhad he ordered the reparation of the Imam Reza shrine. In Astarabad, he repaired (or fortified) the walls, emptied the ditch, built several buildings, one of them being a palace for the governor. Furthermore, he also improved the overall condition of the city. He did something similar in Babol, Ashraf and Sari. Of all these constructions and reparations, his best and most lasting achievement is debatably making Tehran his capital, which to this day is the country&#x27;s capital and largest city.

<text>The L. D. Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics () of the Russian Academy of Sciences is a research institution, located in the small town of Chernogolovka near Moscow (there is also a subdivision in Moscow, on the territory of the P. L. Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems). 
==History==

The Landau Institute was formed in 1964 to keep the &quot;Landau school&quot; alive after the tragic car accident of Lev D. Landau. Since its foundation, the institute grew rapidly to about one hundred scientists, becoming one of the worldwide best-known and leading institutes for theoretical physics.

Unlike many other scientific centers in Russia, the Landau Institute had the strength to cope with the crisis of the nineties in the last century. Although about one half of the scientists accepted positions at leading scientific centers and universities abroad, most of them kept ties with their &quot;home institute&quot;, forming a scientific network in the tradition of the Landau school and supporting young theoretical physicists in the Landau Institute.

==Prominent members==

Up to 1992, the institute was headed by Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov, who was then replaced by Vladimir E. Zakharov. Its numerous prominent scientists, mathematicians as well as physicists, include the Nobel laureate Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov as well as Igor Dzyaloshinsky, Lev Gor&#x27;kov, Vladimir Gribov, Arkady Migdal, Alexander Migdal, Anatoly Larkin, Sergei Novikov, Alexander Polyakov, Mark Azbel, Valery Pokrovsky, Emmanuel Rashba, Sergey Iordanskii, Ioshua Levinson, Alexei Starobinsky, Alexei Kitaev, Vadim Berezinskii (whose early death prevented him from sharing the Nobel Prize for the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition theory), Serguei Brazovskii, Konstantin Efetov, David Khmel&#x27;nitsky, Vladimir Mineev, Grigory Volovik, Paul Wiegmann, Leonid Levitov, Alexander Finkel&#x27;stein, Alexander Zamolodchikov, Vadim Knizhnik, Konstantin Khanin, and Yakov G. Sinai.

==Fields of Research==
The main fields of research are:

* Mathematical physics
* Computational physics 
* Nonlinear dynamics 
* Condensed matter theory
* Nuclear and elementary particle physics 
* Quantum field theory

<text>In a positional numeral system, the radix (:radices) or base is the number of unique digits, including the digit zero, used to represent numbers. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9.

In any standard positional numeral system, a number is conventionally written as with &quot;x&quot; as the string of digits and &quot;y&quot; as its base. For base ten, the subscript is usually assumed and omitted (together with the enclosing parentheses), as it is the most common way to express value. For example, (100)10 is equivalent to 100 (the decimal system is implied in the latter) and represents the number one hundred, while (100)2 (in the binary system with base 2) represents the number four.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Radix&quot; is a Latin word for &quot;root&quot;. &quot;Root&quot; can be considered a synonym for &quot;base,&quot; in the arithmetical sense.

== In numeral systems ==
Generally, in a system with radix &quot;b&quot; (), a string of digits denotes the number , where . In contrast to decimal, or radix 10, which has a ones&#x27; place, tens&#x27; place, hundreds&#x27; place, and so on, radix &quot;b&quot; would have a ones&#x27; place, then a &quot;b&quot;1s&#x27; place, a &quot;b&quot;2s&#x27; place, etc.

For example, if &quot;b&quot; = 12, a string of digits such as 59A (where the letter &quot;A&quot; represents the value of ten) would represent the value = 838 in base 10.

Commonly used numeral systems include:


The octal and hexadecimal systems are often used in computing because of their ease as shorthand for binary. Every hexadecimal digit corresponds to a sequence of four binary digits, since sixteen is the fourth power of two; for example, hexadecimal 7816 is binary 2. Similarly, every octal digit corresponds to a unique sequence of three binary digits, since eight is the cube of two.

This representation is unique. Let &quot;b&quot; be a positive integer greater than 1. Then every positive integer &quot;a&quot; can be expressed uniquely in the form

:formula_1

where &quot;m&quot; is a nonnegative integer and the &quot;r&quot;&#x27;s are integers such that

:0 &lt; &quot;r&quot;&quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; and 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; for &quot;i&quot; = 0, 1, ... , &quot;m&quot; − 1.

Radices are usually natural numbers. However, other positional systems are possible, for example, golden ratio base (whose radix is a non-integer algebraic number), and negative base (whose radix is negative).
A negative base allows the representation of negative numbers without the use of a minus sign. For example, let &quot;b&quot; = −10. Then a string of digits such as 19 denotes the (decimal) number = −1.

<doc id="701217" wikidata="Q161511" url="?curid=701217" title="Crataegus monogyna">
<text>Crataegus monogyna, known as common hawthorn, whitethorn, one-seed hawthorn, or single-seeded hawthorn, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It grows to about tall, producing hermaphrodite flowers in late spring. The berry-like pomes (known as haws) contain a stone-encased seed.

The plant is native to Europe, but has been introduced in many other parts of the world. The pome flesh is of little culinary interest due to its dryness, but is used to make jellies. The young leaves and petals are also edible.

==Description==
The common hawthorn is a shrub or small tree up to about tall, with a dense crown. The bark is dull brown with vertical orange cracks. The younger stems bear sharp thorns, about long. The leaves are long, obovate, and deeply lobed, sometimes almost to the midrib, with the lobes spreading at a wide angle. The upper surface is dark green above and paler underneath.

The hermaphrodite flowers are produced in late spring (May to early June in its native area) in corymbs of 5–25 together; they have numerous red stamens and a single style and are moderately fragrant. The flowers are white, frequently pink pollinated by midges, bees, and other insects, and later in the year bear numerous haws. The haw is a small, oval, dark red fruit about 10 mm long, berry-like, but structurally a pome containing a single seed within a stone, the pyrene. The haws develop in groups of two or three along smaller branches. They are pulpy and delicate in taste.

===Similar species===
The common hawthorn is distinguished from the related but less widespread Midland hawthorn (&quot;C. laevigata&quot;) by its more upright growth, the leaves being deeply lobed, with spreading lobes, and the flowers having just one style, not two or three. They are interfertile, however, so hybrids occur frequently; they are only entirely distinct in their more typical forms. Another species that also hybridises with the common hawthorn is &quot;Crataegus rhipidophylla&quot;, which is distinguished by having finely instead of coarsely serrated lobe margins.

The pomes of some other hawthorns may have up to five seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
This species is one of several that have been referred to as &quot;Crataegus oxyacantha&quot;, a name that has been rejected by the botanical community as too ambiguous. In 1793, Medikus published the name &quot;C. apiifolia&quot; for a European hawthorn now included in &quot;C. monogyna,&quot; but that name is illegitimate under the rules of botanical nomenclature.

Other common names include may, mayblossom, maythorn, (as the plant generally flowers in May) quickthorn, whitethorn, motherdie, and haw.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It is native to Europe, being found in Ireland and Britain. It is also found in northwestern Africa and Western Asia, and has escaped to North America, e.g. the Pacific Northwest.

It grows in disturbed, semi-cleared areas.

==Ecology==

Haws are important for wildlife in winter, particularly thrushes and waxwings; these birds eat the haws and disperse the seeds in their droppings.

Due to excessive animal grazing in the area, new shoots of vulnerable &quot;C. monogyna&quot; trees in the open field are eaten by animals. This does not allow them to grow and causes them to take a horizontally irregular shape on the ground.

A study in Wales indicated that current levels of overgrazing by sheep might extirpate the species in 60–70 years.

== Uses ==
=== Food ===
The fruit of hawthorn, called haws, are sometimes said to be edible raw, but are too dry to be of interest. They are commonly made into jellies, jams, syrups, or wine, or to add flavour to brandy.

The young leaves are tender enough to be used in salads. The petals are also edible. Hawthorn petals are used in the medieval English recipe for spinee, an almond milk-based pottage recorded in &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; by the head chef of King Richard II, .

=== Medicine ===
&quot;C. monogyna&quot; is one of the most common species used as the &quot;hawthorn&quot; of traditional herbalism. The plant parts used are usually sprigs with both leaves and flowers, or alternatively the fruit (&quot;berries&quot;). Hawthorn has been investigated by evidence-based medicine for treating cardiac insufficiency.

&quot;C. monogyna&quot; is a source of antioxidant phytochemicals, especially extracts of hawthorn leaves with flowers.

===Gardening and agriculture===
Common hawthorn is extensively planted as a hedge plant, especially for agricultural use. Its spines and close branching habit render it effectively livestock- and human-proof, with some basic maintenance. The traditional practice of hedgelaying is most commonly practised with this species. It is a good firewood, which burns with a good heat and little smoke.

Numerous hybrids exist, some of which are used as garden shrubs. The most widely used hybrid is &quot;C. × media&quot; (&quot;C. monogyna&quot; × &quot;C. laevigata&quot;), of which several cultivars are known, including the very popular &#x27;Paul&#x27;s Scarlet&#x27; with dark pink double flowers. Other garden shrubs that have sometimes been suggested as possible hybrids involving the common hawthorn, include the various-leaved hawthorn of the Caucasus, which is only very occasionally found in parks and gardens.

== In culture ==
In pre-modern Europe, hawthorn was used as a symbol of hope, and also as a charm against witchcraft and vampires. Hawthorn was believed by some to have the ability to inhibit intruding supernatural forces, and was also thought to be sacred in nature due to an association between the hawthorn bush and the crown of thorns that, according to the New Testament, was placed on Jesus.

As protection against witchcraft, hawthorn was sometimes placed in the cradles of infants, or around houses and doorways. The Greeks reportedly placed pieces of hawthorn in casement windows to prevent witches from entering houses, while Bohemians placed hawthorn on the thresholds of cow houses for the same purpose. Hawthorn was sometimes placed on the coffin of a deceased person, on top of the person&#x27;s corpse, or in the corpse&#x27;s sock. In Bosnia, women would sometimes place a piece of hawthorn behind the headcloth of a recently deceased person, and then throw away the remaining twig on their way home. If the deceased person was a vampire, it would focus its attention on the hawthorn instead of following the woman home. Among the South Slavs, stakes made of hawthorn or blackthorn wood were considered effective in impaling vampires.

=== Notable trees ===
An ancient specimen, and reputedly the oldest tree of any species in France, is to be found alongside the church at Saint Mars sur la Futaie, Mayenne. As of 2009, the tree had a height of and a girth of . The inscription on the plaque beneath reads: &quot;This hawthorn is probably the oldest tree in France. Its origin goes back to St Julien (third century)&quot;; this has not yet been verified.

A famous specimen in England was the Glastonbury or Holy Thorn which, according to legend, sprouted from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea after he thrust it into the ground while visiting Glastonbury in the first century AD. The tree was noteworthy because it flowered twice in a year, once in the late spring which is normal, but also once after the harshness of midwinter had passed. The original tree at Glastonbury Abbey, felled in the 1640s during the English Civil War, has been propagated as the cultivar &#x27;Biflora&#x27;. A replacement was planted by the local council in 1951, but was truncated by vandals in 2010.

The oldest known living specimen in East Anglia, and possibly in the United Kingdom, is known as the Hethel Old Thorn, and is located in the churchyard in the small village of Hethel, south of Norwich, in Norfolk. It is reputed to be more than 700 years old, having been planted in the thirteenth century.

<text>Oswaldo Euclides de Souza Aranha (, 15 February 1894 – 27 January 1960) was a Brazilian politician, diplomat and statesman, who came to national prominence in 1930 under Getúlio Vargas.

He is known in international politics for lobbying for the creation of the State of Israel as head of the Brazilian delegation to the UN and President of the UN General Assembly in 1947. As head of the Brazilian delegation, he was President of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 during the UNGA 181 vote on the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, in which he postponed the vote for three days to ensure its passage. For his efforts on Palestine, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1948.

==Early life and career up to 1942==
Oswaldo Aranha was born in the city of Alegrete in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Aranha obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Law and Social Sciences at the Law School of the now-called Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 1916. After his graduation, he returned to Rio Grande do Sul and practiced as a lawyer for eight years, establishing a personal and professional contact with Getúlio Vargas, who also was a lawyer. His first public office was that of Assistant Police Commissioner in his native state.

Aranha fought the insurrection of 1923, deflagrated by sectors that opposed the fifth consecutive re-election of Borges de Medeiros as governor of Rio Grande do Sul. By personally commanding an irregular armed force consisting of civilians, Aranha fought new uprisings promoted by the opposition in the years that led to the Revolution of 1930.

In a speedy political career, Oswaldo Aranha ran for his first elective office in 1926 and was elected Mayor of Alegrete, but soon became a member of the state legislature and later elected to the National Congress in 1928.

When Vargas ran as opposition candidate for president of Brazil in 1930 and lost, Aranha joined the &quot;tenentes&quot; to convince Vargas to organize a revolt. When the revolt succeeded, Aranha took the first of several positions in the Cabinet of Brazil under now-President Vargas, heading the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among other positions.

Aranha also served as ambassador to the United States in 1934 where he gained recognition as a strong supporter of Pan-Americanism. In 1937 he returned to Brazil to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Aranha played a large role in the 1942 Rio Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.

==Support for the Allies in World War II ==
While serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Brazil took part in the first three consultative meetings of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics which defined Pan-American policy during the early stages of World War II and worked out the recommendation for the collective severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis Powers. During the 1942 Rio conference, he announced that Brazil had cut all diplomatic ties with Nazi Germany, thereby siding with the United States and the Allies. Eventually, most Central and South American states did the same with the exception of Argentina and Chile.

At the first Special Session of the UN General Assembly held in 1947, Oswaldo Aranha, the head of the Brazilian delegation, began a tradition that has remained in which the first speaker at the major international forum is always a Brazilian.

==Attitude toward Jews during WWII==
A book by the historian Maria Luiza Tucci Carneiro argues that Aranha was aware of secret circulars asking that Jews be denied entry visas to Brazil and did little to change that. Jeffrey Lesser&#x27;s &quot;Welcoming the Undesirables: Brazil and the Jewish Question&quot; questions that conclusion by showing that Jewish entry rose notably after the secret circulars were emitted, with the active collaboration of many Brazilian diplomats and businesspeople.

The circular asking for the denial of visas to Jews, however, was not written by Oswaldo Aranha, and it was not made during his term as Minister of Foreign Affairs for Brazil. Mário de Pimentel Brandão was responsible for signing the secret circular in 1937 during his term as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Brazil.

During Oswaldo Aranha&#x27;s term as Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 1938 to 1944, many Jews were granted visas to Brazil despite the circulars. In 1939, Jews were granted 4,601 permanent and temporary resident visas to Brazil. That year, 9% of all permanent residency visas and 14% of temporary Brazilian visas were emitted to people of Jewish origin. In 1940, 2,500 Jewish immigrants were given visas to Brazil.

Considered a moderate by many in and outside of Brazil, he argued that communism was the result of &quot;the Judaism which created and maintains this ambience, capable of sending this civilization into an abyss&quot;.

Albert Einstein asked Oswaldo Aranha for help in obtaining a visa for his friend who was a German Jew, Helene Fabian-Katz. Einstein had previously appealed to the U.S. government for help, but it denied Fabian-Katz a visa. Fabian-Katz was granted a visa to Brazil and joined her brother, who already lived in São Paulo.

==Partition of Palestine vote (1947)==
Aranha supported and heavily lobbied for the partition of Palestine toward the creation of the State of Israel. Streets in Israeli cities such as Beer-Sheva and Ramat Gan, and a square in Jerusalem are named after Aranha.

The photobiography of Oswaldo Aranha published by Pedro Corrêa do Lago in 2017 shows how Oswaldo Aranha, in his position as president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947, was highly instrumental for the assembly&#x27;s approval of the partition of Palestine insofar as he was able to postpone the voting by two days, as Corrêa do Lago explains: &quot;[Aranha] was skillful and when he saw that the partition would not obtain 2/3 of the votes on time he got its allies to stretch their speeches to the max to prevent the vote from being taken that day. The decision was postponed [by Aranha] and as the next day was a holiday in the United States this move bought the time needed to get the [additional] votes&quot;.

In 2007, a street in Tel Aviv was named in his honor at a ceremony attended by his relatives and Brazil&#x27;s ambassador to Israel.

Her first independent release through her new company was her danced-themed EP album, &quot;Four for the Floor&quot;, which was released on July 19, 2011.

=== Television ===
While pursuing her music career, Locke was also interested in becoming a television star. Since 2005, Locke has been featured on many television shows.

In August 2004, Locke was invited to be a guest host on &quot;Good Day Live&quot;, and was invited back to co-host twice more. In 2005, she was a contestant on the game show, Family Feud, and she hosted &quot;Word Slam!&quot;, a GSN live game show; an accompanying documentary with Locke aired on that cable channel that September. Throughout the summer of 2005, a proposed reality TV series, &quot;Aren&#x27;t You That Girl?&quot;, taped Locke&#x27;s progress on her second album and preparations for her upcoming wedding. The engagement was later called off and the project was cancelled. During MTV&#x27;s early fall 2006 lineup, Locke was a judge and co-host on the short-lived reality-show competition &quot;Little Talent Show&quot;.

In 2007 Locke was a participant on the fifth season of &quot;Celebrity Fit Club.&quot; She has been the focused target of derision from fellow cast member Dustin Diamond, who has repeatedly insulted Locke. The ensuing argument caused all other contestants to leave the stage. On June 17, 2007, the season finale of &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; aired, drawing in 2.7 million viewers, the show&#x27;s highest yet.

Locke sat in as a guest co-host of &quot;The View&quot; in March 2007. In April 2008, she also appeared on &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; with her winnings to benefit Camp Heartland. She was the first contestant in the history of the show to attempt the million dollar song. Although unsuccessful, she was awarded $100,000 for ranking so well. Locke vowed she would raise the $400,000 she lost when she unsuccessfully attempted to win the million dollars.

On June 24, 2009, Locke became one of the hosts of the talent show &quot;Gospel Dream&quot; 2009 on Gospel Music Channel.

On September 11, 2010, Locke appeared on Celebrity Ghost Stories.

She has also hosted ABC&#x27;s &quot;Windy City Live&quot;, Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;The Better Show&quot;, and GSN&#x27;s &quot;Word Slam&quot;. In 2013, she appeared as an expert judge on NBCUniversal&#x27;s &quot;Next Great Family Band&quot;.

Locke cohosts &quot;Dr. and the Diva&quot; with Dr. Steve Salvatore. The daytime talk show began in the fall of 2019 and discusses health, food, fashion and fitness.

In 2020, Locke began co-hosting TV infomercials for kitchen appliances marketed by chef Emeril Lagasse.

=== Theatre ===
In 2019, Locke made her Broadway debut as a special guest of Kristin Chenoweth in her one-woman show &quot;Kristin Chenoweth: For the Girls&quot;.

The following year, she announced her own one-woman show called &quot;The Sum of All Parts&quot; which, as summarized by BroadwayWorld.com, &quot;traces the intimate journey down her very own yellow brick road, from growing up bi-racial, to being involved with &quot;American Idol,&quot; to finding herself in the music that flowed throughout her life&quot;. Backed by a 13-piece orchestra, she presented an evening of intimate storytelling of meeting some of her own idols and pays tribute to Etta James, Judy Garland and others.

In 2022, it was announced that Locke would make her musical theater debut, as the lead role in &quot;&quot; on board the Norwegian Prima. Locke plays Diva Donna, playing Summer as she reaches the height of her career. Of taking on the role, Locke stated &quot;Donna Summer&#x27;s inspirational story and pioneering talent led the way for so many of today&#x27;s brightest vocalists. She has left an immeasurable impact on music and culture, and I am excited to bring her story to guests around the world aboard the beautiful Norwegian Prima.&quot;

=== Modeling career and weight loss ===
From 2005 through September 2006, Locke was signed with Ford Models&#x27; 14+ Division. She has appeared on the covers of the July 2005 issue of &quot;Figure&quot; magazine and the summer 2007 issue of UneQ magazine. She has also been a former spokesperson for Lane Bryant and Seven7 Jeans.

At the completion of filming for the show, Kimberley weighed in at a final weight of 149 lbs; down a total of 27 lbs. from her original start weight of 176 lbs. A feature in the September 10th issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine shows Kimberley at 141 lbs., only three pounds away from her goal. Locke announced through her official MySpace blog on October 8, 2007, that she had finally achieved her 40-pound weight loss goal.

In January 2008, Locke was featured as the centerfold of Us Weekly&#x27;s &quot;Diets That Work&quot; issue. The feature counted down the top five celebrity diets of 2007, with Locke being named the winner. Ellen DeGeneres was impressed by the feature and asked Locke to be a special guest on her daytime talk show. The episode taped on January 10, 2008, and aired the following day.

She then went on to work with other organizations such as YouthAIDS, the Davy Foundation, and Camp Heartland. In recognition of her extensive charitable efforts as an HIV/AIDS activist, Locke was presented with the Red Ribbon award on November 9, 2007. &quot;The Red Ribbon Award is done for someone in the community that advocates AIDS awareness, and especially HIV awareness,&quot; said press liaison Chris Prouty. &quot;They want to pinpoint one specific person and get the community involved in the accolades and a congratulatory celebration.&quot; At a news conference prior to her performance that night, Locke gave an acceptance speech. &quot;All the kids [at Camp Heartland] have a great story, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve chosen to be a part of. It&#x27;s the old cliché: kids are our future.&quot; She appeared on a Celebrity episode of Don&#x27;t Forget The Lyrics to raise money for Camp Heartland, walking away with $100,000 for her charity. In March 2010, Locke was voted onto Camp Heartland&#x27;s board of directors.

In October 2007, Locke teamed up with General Mills to introduce the Pink for a Cure campaign to promote awareness of breast cancer in the African-American community. &quot;My aunt is a breast cancer survivor. So, as someone whose family has been directly touched by this disease, I&#x27;m very passionate about getting people talking more about their health,&quot; said Locke.

Locke is also a member of the Entertainment Council of Feeding America, the nation&#x27;s leading hunger-relief organization.

<text>General John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun (5 May 1705 – 27 April 1782) was a British Army officer and peer.

==Early life and career==
Born in Scotland two years before the creation of Great Britain in which his father, Hugh Campbell, 3rd Earl of Loudoun, was a significant figure, Campbell inherited his father&#x27;s estates and peerages in 1731 and became Lord Loudoun. 

He raised a Highland regiment of infantry, Loudon&#x27;s Highlanders, which took part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 on the side of the Hanoverian government. The regiment consisted of twelve companies, with Loudoun as colonel and John Campbell (later 5th Duke of Argyll) as lieutenant-colonel. The regiment served in several different parts of Scotland. Three of the twelve companies, raised in the south, were captured at the Battle of Prestonpans. 

Eight companies, under the personal command of Lord Loudoun, were stationed in Inverness. Loudoun set out in February 1746 with that portion of his regiment and several of the Independent Companies in an attempt to capture the Jacobite pretender, Charles Edward Stuart. The expedition was met by a ruse de guerre by only four Jacobites, which suggested a large force was protecting Stuart, and it returned without engagement. 

That was later publicised as the Rout of Moy. Loudoun then fell back to join the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s army up and gave up the town of Inverness to the rebels. After the Battle of Culloden, Loudoun led his mixed force of regulars, militia and Highlanders in mopping-up operations against the remaining rebels.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
===North America===
In 1756, Loudoun was sent to North America as Commander-in-Chief and Governor General of Virginia, where he was unpopular with many of the colonial leaders. When he learned that some merchants were still trading with the French while he was trying to fight a war against them, he temporarily closed all American ports. Despite his unpopularity the County of Loudoun, formed from Fairfax in 1757, was named in his honour. 

As Commander-in-Chief during the Seven Years&#x27; War, called the French and Indian War in the Thirteen Colonies, he planned an expedition to seize Louisbourg from the French in 1757 but he called it off when intelligence, possibly including a French deception, indicated that the French forces there were too strong for him to defeat. While Loudoun was thus engaged in Canada, French forces captured Fort William Henry from the British, and he was replaced by James Abercrombie and returned to London. Francis Parkman, a 19th-century historian of the Seven Years&#x27; War, rates Loudun&#x27;s martial conduct of the affair poorly.

Many historians debate whether he played a fundamental part in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Arguably, he was an influential figure as he embarked on reforms for the army such as replacing the ordinary musket with the flintlock musket for greater accuracy. He made improvements by embarking on a road improvement programme and recognised the need to supply the army as he replaced the traditional supply line with army wagons. His focus was centralising the system of supplies and had built storehouses in Halifax and Albany and recognised the importance of waterways as a means of transport. Most notably, he integrated regular troops with local militias, and the irregulars were to fight a different kind of war from the linear European style of warfare in which the British had previously been trained.

===Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s anecdotes of Lord Loudon===
Benjamin Franklin provides several first-hand anecdotes of Loudon&#x27;s North American days in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, none of which is complimentary. The following are excerpts:

===Portugal===

In 1762, he was sent to Portugal to counter the Spanish invasion of Portugal as second in command, and he became overall commander in 1763. Despite being unable to prevent the loss of Almeida, the British forces soon launched a counter-attack that drove the invaders back across the border.

==Later life==
Back in Scotland, Loudon in 1763 was made Governor of Edinburgh Castle, a post that he held for the rest of his life.

In 1770, he was promoted to full general.

Loudoun&#x27;s interest in horticulture led to his estate being renowned for its landscaping. He collected willow species in particular from around the globe.

On 23 January 1773, the town of Loudon, New Hampshire, was incorporated and named in his honor. Loudonville, New York, was also named after him as well as the unincorporated town of Loudon, Massachusetts, which was renamed to Otis upon its incorporation.

Campbell remained a bachelor and on his death in 1782 was succeeded as earl by his cousin, James Mure-Campbell.

<text>The R800 is the central processing unit used in the MSX Turbo-R home computer. The R800 was designed by ASCII Corporation of Japan and built by Mitsui &amp; Co The goal was a modern and pipelined CPU binary compatible with the Z80, and therefore with MSX software, while also maintaining compatibility with older MSX Z80-based hardware.

==Compatibility==
During the development of the MSX Turbo R, ASCII Corporation considered various processors, both compatible and incompatible with the Z80, as candidates. At that time, Kazuya Kishioka , a company employee, was researching and developing an ASIC that was a high-speed version of the Z80 and largely customized for the MSX architecture.

For software compatibility with older MSX software, the R800 uses the same instruction set as the Z80, with only minor but useful additions, such as 8x8-bit and 16x16-bit multiplication instructions called MULUB (8-bit), and MULUW (16-bit). Also, many of the undocumented Z80 instructions were made official, including all the opcodes for instructions dealing with IX and IY as 8-bit registers (IXH, IXL, IYH, IYL).

As the R800 is not based directly on the Z80, but stems from the Z800 family, it lacks some of the other undocumented Z80 features. For instance, the undocumented flags represented by bits 3 and 5 of the F register do not hold the same values as in the Z80 (causing it to fail ZEXALL tests) and the undocumented opcode often called SLL is just an alias of the SLA instruction.

==Hardware changes==
Being a much newer design, the R800 implementation was quite different from the old Z80. The changes were similar to the Z800, Z280, Z380 and eZ80 lines of Z80 compatible processors. The original Z80 uses an unusual 4-bit ALU hardware internally, a solution actually able to compete with similar CPUs using full hardwired 8-bit ALU logic (such as its immediate precursor, the Intel 8080). However, the R800 designers implemented a full 16-bit ALU in order to keep up with its more pipelined execution. Instructions like ADD HL,BC that takes 11 clock cycles on the Z80 can in some situations execute in as little as one bus cycle (1-2 clocks) on the R800, due to the degree of pipelining made possible by this full width ALU. The maximum CPU clock speed used on this new MSX was 14.32 MHz—four times as fast as the original 3.57 MHz speed used in the older MSX, while the bus clock was increased to 7.16 MHz. The data bus remained 8-bit to maintain compatibility with old hardware.

===Fetching opcodes===
Additional changes were made in the way the CPU fetches opcodes. The original Z80 uses two cycles to fetch a simple instruction like OR A, plus two cycles for refresh. An additional waitstate is issued on the MSX architecture. A review of the fetch mechanism in a typical MSX environment helps in explaining the R800:

*Z80, cycle 1: set the higher 8-bits of address 
*Z80, cycle 2: set the lower 8-bits of address
*Z80, cycle 3: waitstate
*Z80, cycle 4: refresh, part 1
*Z80, cycle 5: refresh, part 2

Since most implementations of MSX use RAM disposed in a 256×256 bytes block, two cycles are required to set the address for the fetch. The R800 avoids this by remembering the last known state of the higher 8-bits. If the next instruction is in the same 256-byte boundaries, the higher 8-bits are not set, and a cycle is saved. However, on the Z80, the refresh cycles destroy the information on the higher bits, so a workaround was needed.

The solution used in the R800 was to refresh entire blocks of RAM, instead of refreshing one row of RAM on each instruction issued. Each 30μs, the CPU is halted for 4μs, this time is used to refresh a block of the RAM. Since there&#x27;s no refresh in between fetch instructions, and the waitstate is removed due to faster RAM chips, simple instructions can be issued using only one cycle. This cycle would be cycle 2 in the Z80 example above; cycle 1 becomes optional, and it&#x27;s only issued when the program crosses a 256-byte boundary.

==External hardware==
All this only applies to the fast RAM used on the MSX Turbo-R. External hardware, connected through cartridge slots, uses timings similar to Z80. Not even the internal ROM of Turbo-R is fast enough for this fetch scheme, so additional chips on the Turbo-R can mirror the contents of ROM into RAM, in order to make it run faster.

<text>Treo 600 was a smartphone developed by Handspring, and offered under the palmOne brand (later Palm, Inc.) after the merger of the two companies. Released in November 2003, it has a number of integrated features and it is possible to check the calendar while talking on the phone, dial directly from contacts list, take pictures or send emails. It includes a five-way navigation button and favorites screen allowing quick access to the phone functions.

On October 24, 2004, palmOne officially unveiled the Treo 600&#x27;s successor, the Treo 650.

==Design==
The Treo 600 is a rather large device by cell phone standards but compact for a PDA. The 600 is slightly wider and deeper than its predecessor and is nearly half an inch slimmer, giving it a more cell-phone like feel. The new form factor has been compared to a bar of soap. The design is definitely an example of form-follows-function, the front of the phone consists of a full QWERTY keyboard at the bottom with menu and home buttons at the bottom right. Above the keyboard are the 4 application buttons with a &quot;five-way&quot; navigator in-between. Each application button can be mapped to two applications, with the exception of the last button which has one of its functions permanently mapped to the on/off. Above the buttons and navigator is a small Treo logo and the large 160x160 color touch screen.

The top of the phone is occupied by the earpiece, antenna, SDIO/MMC slot; in front of the slot is the Infrared port with the power button which can be used to turn off the screen, or, if held down for a few seconds can turn off the radio functions. Opposite of the IR port is a switch which, by default is set to switch between normal ringer operation and silent mode with vibration. The back of the Treo is simple enough with a Palm logo at the bottom with a reset pin hole offset to the right.

On the back of the phone towards the top is a sticker with various serial numbers and a triangular-shaped speaker grill offset to the left. Above the speaker grill is the VGA camera lens and the top of the stylus is visible above and to the left of the lens. The bottom of the Treo houses the 2.5 mm jack, which can output stereo sound and accept an adapter for standard 3.5 mm jack. Next to the audio jack, in the center of the phone, resides a connector used for data transfer and charging. The upper left side of the phone contains two volume keys; the right side is a mirror image of the left without the volume keys.

The parish founded by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and 100 French colonists of New France on July 26, 1701, is recognized as the second-oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish in the United States. The stunning Gothic Revival cathedral-styled basilica, masterfully designed by Albert E. French, is a testament to the parish&#x27;s enduring legacy.

The basilica gained national recognition with its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In a notable honor, Pope Francis designated the church as a minor basilica on March 1, 2020, marking it as the 86th minor basilica in the United States and the third in Michigan. 

The main entrance opens onto a picturesque plaza, lined with grand trees and paved with historic brick. The structure&#x27;s flying buttresses and facade&#x27;s main entrance guarded by four imposing gargoyles pay homage to the parish&#x27;s rich French heritage. Notably, the basilica boasts the oldest stained glass in the City of Detroit, adding to its historic significance and breathtaking beauty. 

A side chapel attached to the basilica houses treasured relics from the past. The historic high altar from the 1818 stone church takes center stage, accompanied by the revered tomb of Rev. Gabriel Richard. Other artifacts carefully preserved in the basilica from the 1818 stone church include the ornate communion rail, the revered statue of Ste. Anne, and the iconic Beaubien Bell, a cherished church bell that continues to hold sentimental value.

==Parish History==
On June 5, 1701, a flotilla of 25 canoes embarked from Montreal, Quebec carrying a diverse group of travelers, including 50 soldiers, 50 artisans, 2 priests, and French explorer, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac. Their journey took them along the St. Lawrence River route, winding through Lakes Ontario and Erie, before finally entering the Detroit River. After nearly two months of travel, they arrived at their destination on July 24, landing at the foot of a steep bluff that stretched along the riverbank, specifically at the present site of Hart Plaza. Perched twenty to thirty feet above the sparkling waters, they began constructing Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, a strategic outpost that would play a pivotal role in history.

One of the first structures erected by the early settlers was a chapel, traditionally believed to have been constructed on July 26, the feast day of Saint Anne. This saint held special significance for the French pioneers as they had adopted her as their patroness. In her honor, the outpost&#x27;s inaugural street and primary thoroughfare, until 1805, was named &quot;Ste. Anne Street.&quot; Successive churches maintained a prominent presence on this site, situated just west of present-day Jefferson and Griswold Streets.

Among the two priests accompanying Cadillac, Rev. François Vaillant de Gueslis, S.J., had intended to focus on missionary work with the native population. However, due to ongoing tensions between Cadillac and the Jesuit order, Fr. Vaillant de Gueslis soon returned to Montreal. In contrast, Rev. Constantin de L&#x27;Halle, O.F.M. Rec., remained at Fort Pontchartrain, serving as its sole chaplain. For nearly a century, the Recollects continued to provide spiritual guidance to the parish, playing a vital role in the community&#x27;s development and earning a revered place as the heart and soul of the struggling settlement.

A devastating fire set by the natives swept through the fort on October 5, 1703, destroying the church, rectory, and several other buildings. Fueled by strong winds, the blaze consumed the parish&#x27;s earliest sacrament records, leaving behind a gap in its history. A new register was begun, with the first entry recording the baptism of Marie Therese, Cadillac&#x27;s daughter, on February 2, 1704. Remarkably, this marked the beginning of an unbroken series of sacrament registers. Despite Fr. de L&#x27;Halle’s dedication, he faced numerous challenges, including the poverty of his church. The rebuilt structure lacked even the most basic necessities, and Cadillac appealed to his superior for assistance, requesting funding on behalf of the parish, highlighting the dire situation.

The presence of a single priest was insufficient to educate and enlighten the sizable native population, composed mainly of the Ottawa, Wyandot, and Miami tribes, that had gathered around the fort. Long-standing animosities between the tribes frequently flared into violence. One such outbreak in 1706, in which the Miami and Ottawa tribes clashed, resulted in the tragic death of Fr. de L&#x27;Halle as he tended to his garden outside the fort. Following the death of Fr. de L&#x27;Halle, Cadillac returned from Quebec, bringing with him Rev. Dominique de la Marche, O.F.M. Rec. Fr. de la Marche’s primary mission was to minister exclusively to the natives. However, due to the sudden vacancy of a parish pastor, he assumed Fr. de L&#x27;Halle responsibilities, attending to the needs of the French as well.

To address the ongoing need for a dedicated native missionary, Rev. Cherubin Deniau, O.F.M. Rec. arrived in 1707. A year later, as construction commenced on the first substantial church building, Fr. de la Marche departed for Quebec, leaving Fr. Deniau as the pastor. Under Fr. Deniau’s care were 63 French settlers residing in primitive homes constructed from stakes, mud, and grass thatch. 29 of these settlers opted to farm land outside the fort, rather than occupy the small building lots, averaging 25 x 25 ft., within the enclosure.

During the eight years that he spent in Detroit, Fr. Deniau was particularly successful in his missionary work among the natives. An inventory of his personal property was drawn up and signed by Fr. Deniau on August 25, 1711. No mention is made in the document of his residence, but the item referring to the church reads:“Also a building, used as a church, 23 feet long, 24 1/2 feet wide, 10 high; boarded entirely above, with oak joists in a good ridge, and below of beams with square joints; with doors, window and shutters, and sash frames between of twenty squares each; the whole closing with a key. Also a heavy bell.”The sanctuary featured a green carpet, upon which rested a beautifully crafted French walnut-wood altar, complete with steps and a lockable tabernacle. Above the tabernacle, a velveteen-draped turning box showcased a small copper or brass crucifix, which can be rotated to reveal a silver monstrance. The altar was adorned with large, painted wooden candlesticks, supplemented by eight bunches of worn, artificial flowers arranged in four red wooden pots on feast days. Two small, French walnut-wood credence tables with small bolts stand at one side, while a stunning gilded wood picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary hung behind the altar. Completing the sanctuary was a humble tin lantern suspended from the ceiling, serving as a sanctuary lamp. The church&#x27;s construction differed from the other buildings within the palisade. Unlike the upright log or stake-type structures, the church was built with logs &quot;laid one on the other,&quot; similar to the warehouse. This distinctive design set these two buildings apart from the others within the fort.

As Fr. Deniau&#x27;s tenure drew to a close in 1714, he witnessed the devastating destruction of the church. Cadillac had been reassigned as Governor of Louisiana, leaving a power vacuum at the fort. His successor, Charles Regnault, Sieur Dubuisson, was appointed, but lacked Cadillac&#x27;s authoritative presence, particularly among the natives. As English influence expanded across the continent, posing a growing threat to the fledgling French post, Dubuisson made the fateful decision to consolidate his forces within a shortened palisade. This strategic move left the church, for the first time, vulnerable and exposed outside the stockade, ultimately sealing its fate for destruction. The Fox Indians of Wisconsin posed a formidable threat to the fort in 1712. Faced with the imminent attack, the defenders made the difficult decision to sacrifice the church in order to safeguard the fort. To defend a smaller, more secure area, the pickets were withdrawn, and the church, which would have provided valuable cover for the attackers, was razed. For several years following the destruction of the church, Mass was celebrated in a makeshift chapel within one of the larger buildings inside the fort.

Between 1715 and 1718, Rev. Hyacinthe Pelfresne was made pastor. He was succeeded by Rev. Antoine Delino, who remained until the summer of 1722. This marked the beginning of Rev. Bonaventure Lienard&#x27;s lengthy pastorate, which spanned over three decades until 1754. Notably, Fr. Lienard&#x27;s tenure was distinguished by a significant change in the canonical status of the parish. Unlike his predecessors, who had signed the registers as chaplains of the fort, Fr. Lienard began his entries as the &quot;pastor&quot;, signifying a shift towards a more formal parish structure.

The parish authority structure relied on an ancient French parish model called &quot;La Fabrique,&quot; which had been imported from Quebec. This system consisted of the pastor and three laymen, known as &quot;marguilliers&quot; or churchwardens, who managed the finances. The marguilliers collected revenues, paid debts, and safeguarded funds in a strongbox with dual locks. Annual elections were held on the last Sunday of December to select new marguilliers and retire the existing chief warden. These esteemed individuals held prominent positions in the parish, with elevated pews denoting their trust and importance. The marguilliers played significant roles in processions, carrying canopies during Blessed Sacrament processions and receiving ashes, palms, and candles on special feasts. 

Parish income came from collections, stipends for events like weddings and funerals, and pew rent. The pastor&#x27;s income was separate, supported by tithes (1/26 of the grain harvest) and the Christmas collection. During the Christmas season, the pastor would visit each household, discussing temporal and spiritual matters. The chief marguillier would transport him, and another marguillier would collect donations. The &quot;fabrique&quot; focused solely on financial and material church matters, while spiritual and liturgical aspects were governed by tradition, law, and the pastor&#x27;s will, as well as the bishop&#x27;s authority.

Early Detroiters attended Mass frequently, with 34 Holy Days of Obligation initially. However, in 1744, the Bishop of Quebec reduced this to 15. Sunday was the primary day for worship and socializing, with the community gathering for Mass and exchanging news and strengthening friendships afterward. During this period, Detroit&#x27;s growth stagnated, and at one point, the government even considered abandoning the settlement. However, the increasing English presence in the region rekindled French interest, reigniting the passions of the colonists. Regrettably, tensions persisted between the settlers and successive fort commanders, primarily stemming from disputes over trading privileges. As a result, Fr. Lienard increasingly found himself assuming the role of peacemaker, mediating conflicts and striving to maintain harmony within the community.

Beginning in 1730, the government of New France recognized the strategic importance of the fort in potential conflicts with England. To foster growth, they offered incentives to immigrants and discharged soldiers willing to settle near the fort. Proclamations, such as the one issued by Governor Galissonniere, were circulated along the St. Lawrence River, enticing prospective settlers with attractive offers. New arrivals after 1749 received land grants on both sides of the Detroit River. As a result, Detroit began to transform into an agricultural community. These land grants played a significant role in population growth, reaching approximately 500 residents by 1755.

During this period, several notable changes occurred in Detroit. Previously, the parish had worshiped in a temporary space within the fort. However, with Fr. Lienard&#x27;s arrival, plans were underway to construct a more permanent and suitable church. This new church was completed in 1723, and Father del Halle&#x27;s remains were reinterred there. Another significant development involved the native population outside the fort. Following the collapse of Cadillac&#x27;s vision, most of the natives had gradually dispersed, leading to a shift in the demographic makeup of the area. In 1727, the Wyandot tribe, known for their peaceful nature and Christian influences, petitioned the governor to send a Jesuit missionary to minister to them. In response, Rev. Armand de La Richardie, S.J. was assigned to join the Wyandot, and he established his residence in their encampment south of the fort, near present-day Third Avenue.

By 1738, the parish had grown to over 600 members. However, a tribal war broke out that year, disrupting the mission and causing many of the Wyandot to flee for refuge to Sandusky, Ohio. After considerable effort, Fr. de La Richardie successfully reunited with them and, in 1742, relocated them to Bois Blanc Island, where he established a new mission. This center would become the site of the devoted service of Rev. Pierre Potier, as the last Jesuit missionary in the West. Arriving in 1744, Fr. Potier would spend nearly four decades ministering to this resilient remnant of the Jesuit missions.

Despite the thriving trade between the mission and the fort, exchanging goods like lumber, iron, grain, and hides, there appears to have been minimal commercial interaction between the missionaries and the French residents of the post. Interestingly, while Cadillac&#x27;s original plan included educating the natives, it seems that little attention was given to the education of the French children in the settlement, apart from religious instruction. Providing religious instruction was a core responsibility of the parish pastors. During Fr. Lienard&#x27;s tenure, several petitions were submitted to the bishop, requesting that an order of sisters be sent to the fort to provide instruction to the youth and encourage the inhabitants to establish permanent residences. Unfortunately, the proposal became mired in colonial bureaucratic red tape and ultimately never came to fruition.

In 1760, Major Robert Rogers led the British takeover of Detroit from the French, with the Marquis of Vaudreuil&#x27;s blessing. The French garrison was taken prisoner, but the French inhabitants were allowed to stay on their farms, provided they pledged allegiance to the British Crown. This transition wasn&#x27;t without its challenges. In 1763, Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, launched Pontiac&#x27;s War attempting to seize the fort as part of a larger conspiracy against the British. Although his efforts were ultimately foiled, the siege lasted from May to October, with Major Gladwin defending the fort.

The Siege of Detroit marked a pivotal moment for both Fr. Bocquet and Fr. Potier. Fr. Bocquet brought solace to soldiers on the battlefield and hope to those captured by the Indians. Despite potential sympathies for Pontiac&#x27;s cause, the French residents of Detroit remained loyal, bound by the oath they had sworn and the kindness with which they had been treated by the British. Meanwhile, Fr. Potier demonstrated remarkable courage in the face of danger. He successfully deterred the Huron from joining Pontiac&#x27;s forces by threatening to withhold Church ministrations from those who disobeyed him, showcasing his unwavering commitment to his faith and his flock.

As the fort became a hub for English soldiers, traders, and immigrants from Ireland and Scotland, a more relaxed social and religious atmosphere emerged. This shift introduced new challenges for Fr. Bocquet, who struggled to maintain his parish&#x27;s cohesion. Mixed marriages and the influx of new influences began to erode the congregation&#x27;s unity. Some parishioners relocated to outlying areas, seeking a simpler way of life, which further strained the material prosperity of the parish. The church began to fall into disrepair. Despite these difficulties, Fr. Bocquet remained a dedicated and zealous pastor.

In 1767, Fr. Bocquet requested that the bishop divide the parish, citing the vast territory and growing population as reasons for the need. The request was granted on August 7, 1767. Fr. Potier&#x27;s settlement on the south side of the river (today in Windsor, Ontario), known as &quot;The Mission of Our Lady of the Assumption among the Hurons in Detroit,&quot; was formally established as Our Lady of the Assumption Parish. Fr. Potier&#x27;s sudden death on July 16, 1781 marked the beginning of a transition. Fr. Bocquet, grown feeble, was forced into retirement in 1782. He was replaced by Rev. Louis Payet, a priest of the Diocese of Quebec. Fr. Payet&#x27;s primary interest was in missionary work, and he frequently left the parish to embark on journeys. During his absences, Rev. Jean François Hubert, and later Rev. Pierre Frechette assumed his duties. In a surprising turn of events, Fr. Frechette swapped pastorates with Fr. Dufaux, Fr. Payet&#x27;s replacement. Fr. Dufaux recounted his experience at the fort, where he spent three days and celebrated Mass twice. Despite the presence of many people, he received a cold welcome. He observed that the English residents prioritized education, with four or five schools in the fort. Feeling overwhelmed, Fr. Dufaux confided in Fr. Frechette, who shared his own struggles and frustrations. The two priests ultimately decided to swap roles, with Fr. Frechette taking the parish at the fort and Fr. Dufaux assuming the responsibilities at Our Lady of the Assumption Parish.

War once again disrupted the parish as the British dispatched their native allies to carry out brutal raids in the Ohio territory during the American Revolutionary War. Bishop Briand issued a stern directive prohibiting French Catholics within the Diocese of Quebec from supporting the Americans, motivated by concerns about the anti-Catholic sentiments in the American colonies. However, despite pressure to remain loyal to the British, the sentiment among the French began to shift. With the onset of American rule on July 11, 1796, the affiliation between the Church in Michigan and the Diocese of Quebec was formally severed.

Our Lady of the Assumption Parish was the first parish to branch off from Ste. Anne Parish, but since the United States now controlled the Michigan Territory following the Revolutionary War, the parish was now located on the British side of the Detroit River and no longer part of the Michigan Church. The distinction of being Michigan&#x27;s second parish falls to St. Anthony of Padua, situated about two and a half miles west of Monroe, Michigan, along the Raisin River. As early as October 1788, discussions began about establishing a parish to serve the rapidly growing area of Frenchtown, near Monroe, Michigan, at the River Raisin. Fr. Dufaux brought the settlers&#x27; needs to the bishop&#x27;s attention, leading to Fr. Frechette being tasked with organizing the parish. From 1788 to 1794, St. Anthony operated as a mission of Ste. Anne Parish, with Rev. Edmund Burke eventually taking residence in the Frenchtown settlement. Over time, the original church site was abandoned in favor of a more suitable location in Monroe. During the Redemptorists&#x27; eleven-year tenure in Monroe, starting in 1844, the parish was renamed St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception Parish.

Fr. Frechette remained at Ste. Anne until 1796, when Detroit was officially transferred to American control, as stipulated in the 1783 Treaty of Paris (1783). With Detroit now under United States jurisdiction, it fell within the episcopal authority of Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. Bishop Carroll responded by sending Rev. Michael Levadoux, P.S.S. and Rev. Gabriel Richard, P.S.S., who had fled the turmoil of the French Revolution. Fr. Levadoux became the new pastor, while Fr. Richard arrived two years later. Fr. Levadoux and Fr. Richard, shared a deep and abiding respect for one another. Their bond was so strong that initially, there were concerns that Fr. Levadoux might decline the Detroit post without Fr. Richard by his side, given his reliance on his support. However, as both priests couldn&#x27;t be spared for the Detroit assignment at that time, Fr. Levadoux was persuaded to take on the role alone, at least for the time being.

Fr. Levadoux&#x27;s arrival on August 14, 1796, marked the beginning of a new era. As he settled into his new role, he was greeted by a sleepy fur-trading village predominantly inhabited by English traders. However, his French congregants resided along the riverbanks, sustaining themselves through fishing, hunting, and farming narrow strips of land. To announce his arrival, Fr. Levadoux had the bells of Ste. Anne rung the following morning. This joyful gesture was met with mutual respect and goodwill between government representatives, including Colonel Hamtramck and General Anthony Wayne, and the parish. For two years, Fr. Levadoux worked tirelessly without an assistant, serving the Catholics in Wayne and Monroe counties, as well as those in Our Lady of the Assumption Parish, and smaller groups along the Clinton and St. Clair Rivers. His ministerial duties were complicated by an increase in mixed marriages, largely due to the arrival of General Wayne&#x27;s army, which brought a new wave of pioneers to the area. Additionally, Fr. Levadoux faced challenges from Tory sympathizers within his parish, who threatened the community&#x27;s peace. He actively combated these sentiments, demonstrating unwavering loyalty to America, the country that had given him refuge. Despite his enthusiasm, Fr. Levadoux struggled to meet the needs of his sprawling parish. He repeatedly appealed to the bishop for assistance, specifically requesting the help of his friend, Fr. Richard. Fr. Richard joined Fr. Levadoux in Detroit on June 3, 1798. Around the same time, Rev. John Dilhet, P.S.S., arrived from Baltimore to oversee the River Raisin settlement. This allowed Fr. Richard to focus on scattered Catholics across a vast area from the Rouge, Ecorse, Huron, and Raisin Rivers, and along Maumee Bay&#x27;s curve in the south, to L&#x27;Anse Creuse, the Clinton River, Anchor Bay, Swan Creek, and the St. Clair and Black Rivers in the north. Fr. Richard established a log chapel near the Clinton River&#x27;s mouth in 1799. This marked the founding of St. Peter Parish in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, the third oldest parish in Michigan.

Fr. Levadoux&#x27;s declining health forced him to leave Detroit in 1802. Before his departure, he and Fr. Richard welcomed Bishop Pierre Denaut of Quebec, the first bishop to visit Michigan. In 1801, Bishop Denaut was conducting a visitation of his diocese and, with Bishop Carroll&#x27;s permission, traveled to Detroit with his secretary, Fr. Payet, the former pastor of Ste. Anne. During his visit, Bishop Denaut administered the Sacrament of Confirmation. According to Fr. Richard&#x27;s records, 536 parishioners, ranging in age from 12 to 80, received the sacrament. Notably, fewer than ten non-French names appeared on the list, reflecting the predominantly French-speaking community.

Detroit suffered from the Great Fire of 1805. Fr. Richard had already begun making plans for a new church even before the fire. Initially, the response to his proposal was very positive, but unfortunately, petty squabbles and jealousies soon derailed the project, reducing it to mere talk. As a result, only repairs to the existing building were undertaken, rather than constructing a new church. Following the fire, Fr. Richard quickly implemented relief measures to support Detroit during the rebuilding process. A new city plan was proposed, which would eradicate the site of the church and its adjacent cemetery. Fr. Richard coined the motto for the City of Detroit, &quot;Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus,&quot; which translates to &quot;We hope for better things; it shall arise from the ashes.” This motto reflected his optimism and resilience in the face of adversity. In compensation, the parish was offered a new plot of land bounded by Randolph, Larned, Bates, and Cadillac Square. Although Fr. Richard accepted the proposal, parishioners vehemently opposed it, causing a significant delay in the construction of a new church until 1818. Services were temporarily conducted at Meldrum&#x27;s Warehouse, located near the foot of Wayne Street along the riverbank. This warehouse was one of the few buildings that survived the devastating fire. Later, Fr. Richard relocated his religious and educational endeavors to a rented farmhouse in Springwells. From this new location, he continued to serve his community, while also attempting to instill in the citizens the innovative idea that education was a collective responsibility, rather than an individual one.

Fr. Richard played a crucial role in establishing schools in Detroit. Alongside Rev. Jean Dilhet, who assisted him from 1804 to 1805, Fr. Richard founded two educational institutions. One school, under Fr. Dilhet&#x27;s guidance, catered to boys, while the other, directed by Fr. Richard, was the Young Ladies&#x27; Academy. Demonstrating his dedication to education, Fr. Richard personally selected four teachers and instructed them on subject matter and teaching methods. This initiative marked the first teacher-training course and the first normal school training in the entire Northwest Territory. Fr. Richard&#x27;s commitment to the native community also persisted. Following the Treaty of Fort Meigs in 1817, the natives gifted him six sections of land. They specified that three sections were for &quot;the Church of Ste. Anne de Detroit,&quot; while the remaining three were allocated to the newly established University of Michigan. The natives&#x27; stipulation reflected their affection for the Catholic faith and their desire for future educational opportunities for their children. In 1817, remains from the original church cemetery were reinterred in the churchyard of the new church. Decades later, in the 1860s, many of these remains were moved once more to Mount Elliott Cemetery in Detroit.

On June 9, 1818, a milestone was reached with the laying of the cornerstone for the seventh Ste. Anne Church. This achievement was made possible by Judge Augustus Woodward&#x27;s vision for the new town, modeled after L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s iconic plan for Washington, D.C. As part of this design, Jefferson Avenue was extended, and the church was constructed on the northeast corner of Larned and Bates Streets. The land for the church was generously assigned by the Governor and Judges in exchange for the original Ste. Anne site within the fort. The cornerstone-laying ceremony was attended by distinguished guests, including Governor Lewis Cass and Bishop Joseph Flaget. Two years later, in 1820, the church&#x27;s basement was completed and began hosting Mass. The upper portion of the church was finally completed in 1828, and it was first used on Christmas Day. The rerouting of Jefferson Avenue through the original site of Ste. Anne Church sparked a decade-long period of bitter resentment among parishioners. This tumultuous era ultimately ended in interdict. Fr. Richard, blamed for the loss of the original grounds due to his initial acceptance of the new arrangement, remained composed amidst the turmoil, steadfastly fulfilling his role as spiritual leader. Fr. Richard had considered retiring in favor of Fr. Dilhet. However, he chose to persevere, dedicating himself to the well-being of his parishioners despite the adversity.

As Fr. Richard&#x27;s missionary work progressed, several new chapels emerged in the region. One such chapel was established on Maumee Bay, laying the groundwork for the present church in Erie, Michigan. Additionally, a group of former parishioners who had previously advocated for a new church to be built closer to their homes northeast of Detroit constructed a chapel in what is now Riverside Park, east of the Belle Isle Bridge. Meanwhile, at Mackinac, a new structure was being built to replace the old Jesuit chapel that had been destroyed years earlier. In the spring of 1832, Michigan was served by eight priests, stationed at various missions and outposts. However, the threat of an Indian War loomed as Black Hawk, the Sauk chief, rallied allies near the Mississippi to resist the encroachment of settlers. Before the conflict could escalate, the Asiatic cholera epidemic took place, bringing devastating grief to Detroit, prompting widespread panic and causing some citizens to flee. Fr. Richard joined the relief efforts by helping to establish a nursing corps, providing critical care and support to those affected by the cholera epidemic. His efforts to care for those afflicted ultimately took a profound toll on him. On September 13, 1832, he succumbed to the disease, becoming the last victim in Detroit. 

On March 8, 1833, the Vatican established of the Diocese of Detroit with Rev. Frederic Rese appointed bishop with his throne at Ste. Anne Church. Bishop Rese assumed leadership of the &quot;Diocese of Michigan and the Northwest,&quot; which encompassed the remaining territory of the old Northwest Territory after Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois gained statehood. Bishop Rese leveraged funds from European missionary societies establishing St. Anne Classical Academy in a newly constructed building adjacent to the cathedral. To provide education for girls, Bishop Rese introduced the Poor Clares, the diocese&#x27;s first order of religious women, who oversaw the Female Academy of St. Clare Seminary. In 1837, the College of St. Phillip was inaugurated in a building connected to the chapel constructed by rebellious parishioners following the 1805 fire. The college stood on the river end of a farm, which Bishop Rese had acquired for the diocese in 1833. This property, known as the Church Farm, would later become embroiled in prolonged litigation. Bishop Rese faced health challenges and was recalled to Rome in April 1837. During this sabbatical, Rev. Badin assumed administrative duties for the diocese until Rev. Peter Paul Lefevere was appointed coadjutor bishop but arrived with some apprehension as he was aware that Bishop Rese left behind unresolved issues. Bishop Lefevere&#x27;s reign would ultimately transform the diocese, marking a significant shift: the eventual demise of the Ste. Anne Cathedral.

Between the 1820s and the 1840s, a parish trend emerged where lay trustees exerted control over church property and appointment rights, often in direct opposition to their bishops due to the limited scope of episcopal authority. During Fr. Richard’s pastorate, the Northwest Territory&#x27;s civil government consisted of a governor and three judges. In 1807, they passed &quot;An Act concerning Religious Societies,&quot; granting religious organizations the power to own and manage property. Fr. Richard subsequently filed Articles of Incorporation for the parish, naming the pastor and four trustees as the Corporation&#x27;s personnel. In 1834, this Corporation entered into a perpetual lease agreement with the bishop, transferring control of parish properties in exchange for the bishop&#x27;s assumption of specific obligations. The trustees of the Corporation of Ste. Anne attempted to nullify the 999-year lease they had granted to the diocese in 1834. They cited unmet conditions, including: settling all corporation debts within two years, completing necessary repairs on parish buildings, establishing a school and orphan asylum, and delivering a French sermon every Sunday and holy day. Bishop Lefevere expressed his willingness to comply with these conditions. With financial support from German and French missionary societies, he worked to alleviate mistrust among those opposed to episcopal control. However, establishing a school and orphan society proved to be the most challenging condition for the bishop to fulfill. On May 30, 1844, four Sisters of Charity arrived in Detroit, marking the beginning of their new mission. They settled into the former residence of the Poor Clares and swiftly established a school within a month. However, the experience left Bishop Lefevere with a lingering distrust of the parish trustee structure. He promptly began making plans for a new cathedral, free from lay oversight. Moreover, he took decisive steps to abolish the trustee system altogether, introducing a policy where the bishop would hold ownership of all diocese properties. This move, in part a response to the parish trustees, ultimately led to the church relinquishing its primacy, a status it had held for nearly 150 years. Ste. Anne School maintained its exceptional standards, outshining other institutions in Detroit. Its reputation received a boost in 1851 with the arrival of four De La Salle Brothers who took charge of the male students. At that time, Rev. Peter Kindekens served as both pastor and Vicar General.

The bishop&#x27;s sale of the reserved diocesan properties yielded over $164,000 for the diocesan treasury. The sold properties included: the triangular block between Bates and Congress Streets and Cadillac Square, a triangular piece on Randolph Street, and 12 lots on Miami Avenue. While this transaction resolved one issue, it also gave rise to a new problem. Bishop Borgess declined to relinquish his rights under the lease, instead offering to cancel it if the diocese&#x27;s expenses incurred during its tenure were reimbursed. After considerable acrimony, the bishop presented the Trustees with an offer they could not refuse. Despite the compromise, both parties felt wronged. Bishop Borgess expressed his stance in a message, emphasizing that the property rightfully belonged to him. However, he proposed a compromise to resolve disputes and prevent further conflict. The terms of the compromise included: Ste. Anne Church would retain control of the square, the lease would be canceled, and the bishop would acquire the triangle and the Monnier Lot.

In June 1875, St. Joachim Parish was established on Detroit&#x27;s east side to serve the city&#x27;s growing French population, composed largely of newcomers from Montreal drawn to the shipbuilding industry. The new parish boundaries, east of Riopelle Street, included former Ste. Anne&#x27;s parishioners who were no longer entitled to benefits from the Corporation&#x27;s property management. Tensions arose when the Corporation of 1880 sold a portion of its holdings for $100,000. St. Joachim Parish demanded an equal division of the proceeds, supported by Fr. Laporte. Meanwhile, the western half of Ste. Anne Parish, which had grown significantly, sought provision for its own needs. A proposed solution involved abandoning Ste. Anne Church and dividing its assets between the two parishes. Although Bishop Borgess approved this plan, the Corporation resisted, citing the historical significance and sentimental value of Ste. Anne Church, erected by Fr. Richard. It was suggested that the bishop&#x27;s motivation for approving the plan was to eliminate the unusual property ownership arrangement in his diocese, as he intended for parish properties to be vested in him. Intense pressure from both the eastern and western parishes ultimately led the trustees to sell the square surrounding Ste. Anne Church for approximately $200,000. The proceeds were divided between the two parishes, sealing the fate of the church. On June 28, 1886, Rev. Peter Giroux celebrated the final Mass. The last trustees of Ste. Anne Parish were Eli Barkume, Francis Xavier Monnier, and Charles M. Rousseau.

The cornerstone for the current Basilica of Ste. Anne de Detroit was laid on April 28, 1886 and dedicated by Rev. Edward Joos, diocesan administrator, on October 30, 1887. To symbolize continuity, the cornerstone of the old Ste. Anne Church was split, with one half going to the new Ste. Anne Church and the other to St. Joachim Church. St. Joachim Church received various artifacts from the old Ste. Anne Church, including: the side altars, organ, Stations of the Cross, statues of the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and pulpit. The new Ste. Anne Church retained significant historical items: the high altar, the Beaubien Bell, statue of Ste. Anne, the communion rail, and the remains of Fr. Richard.

Bishop Borgess sought French-speaking priests to serve the new Ste. Anne Church, and he turned to Our Lady of the Assumption Parish. Specifically, he looked to the priests of the Congregation of St. Basil, who staffed the parish schools and possessed the desired language skills and expertise. With their extensive experience in education and pastoral ministry, the Basilians were well-equipped to respond to Bishop Borgess&#x27;s call. Moreover, they were already familiar to the people living on the American side of the Detroit River.

When the Basilians arrived at the parish, Rev. J. B. Frachon served as administrator for a month. On August 29, 1886, Rev. Peter Grand became pastor. One of Fr. Grand&#x27;s initial actions was establishing Les Dames d&#x27;Autel, an Altar Society that provided valuable services to the church, focusing on the sanctuary&#x27;s adornment and cleanliness. During his tenure, Detroit celebrated its bicentennial in 1901, with Ste. Anne Church playing a prominent role. An elaborate program was organized, featuring: a High Mass pontificated by Archbishop Diomede Falconio, Apostolic Delegate to Canada, on July 26, 1901; attendance by high-ranking civic officials from the United States and Canada; a sermon delivered by Archbishop Paul Bruchesi of Montreal; participation by other church dignitaries in the sanctuary. On July 27, 1901, Archbishop William Elder of Cincinnati presided over a Pontifical Requiem Mass at Ste. Anne Church. Bishop Henry Gabriels of Ogdensburg, New York, delivered the sermon.

A succession of dedicated Basilian pastors have served Ste. Anne Parish: Rev. Luke Renaud: Advanced the parish and school during his 14-year tenure, Rev. John Ryan (1921-1931), Rev. M. V. Kelly (1931-1932), Rev. Luke Beuglet, Rev. Edward Allor, Rev. John Glavin, Rev. Charles Kelly, Rev. M. Stanley Lynch, Rev. Rudolph S. Dieme, Rev. Roger F. deBilly, Rev. Donald Mooney, Rev. Robert Power.

Following the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, the parish established an elementary and high school. Initially, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary staffed the schools. Many of these sisters were fluent in both English and French. Later, during Fr. Edward Allor&#x27;s pastorate, the administration and staffing of the schools transitioned to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Kalamazoo, Michigan.

The 20th century saw rapid industrial growth in Detroit, driven largely by the automobile manufacturing boom. This led to a massive influx of immigrants, transforming demographics. The French surrounding the parish began to decline and disperse. The parish heard the last regular Mass with a French sermon in 1942. As braceros and construction workers settled in the area, they faced limited access to spiritual guidance. To address this need, Holy Trinity Parish temporarily allocated two pews for the community, with Rev. James Barrett providing brief instructions in Spanish. The League of Catholic Women and the Damas Catolicas Mexicanas advocated for a monthly Mass honoring Spanish-speaking servicemen in World War II. Rev. John Glavin approved, and a restored chapel hosted the first Mass in 1944. In 1946, Rev. John Collins, C.S.B., was assigned to minister to the Hispanic community. Later, Rev. Gerald Orsini established the Confraternity of the Third Order of St. Francis and helped develop the Caballeros Catolicos, focusing on spiritual, cultural, educational, and economic development. Urban development and the construction of freeways led to the deterioration of the neighborhood, displacing families and threatening the parish&#x27;s future. Despite these challenges, supporters rallied to save the historic church. The 1967 riots had a profound impact on the parish, causing many to flee in fear, however, the Hispanic community continued to grow.

<doc id="701247" wikidata="Q433454" url="?curid=701247" title="John Brown (Kentucky politician, born 1757)">
<text>John Brown (September 12, 1757August 29, 1837) was an American lawyer and statesman who participated in the development and formation of the State of Kentucky after the American Revolutionary War.

Brown represented Virginia in the Continental Congress (1777–1778) and the U.S. Congress (1789–1791). While in Congress, he introduced the bill granting Statehood to Kentucky. Once that was accomplished, he was elected by the new state legislature as a U.S. Senator for Kentucky. From 1803 to 1804, Brown served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate.

==Early life==
John Brown was born in Augusta County in the Colony of Virginia, on September 12, 1757. He was a son of Reverend John Brown and Margaret Preston Brown, immigrants from northern Ireland. The son of a Presbyterian minister and schoolmaster, John was well educated, first at his father&#x27;s Liberty Hall Academy (now Washington and Lee University), and then at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). His studies at Princeton were halted, temporarily, as a result of the approach of English troops during the American Revolutionary War.

Brown&#x27;s role during the Revolutionary War is unclear. The family tradition was that Brown served under General George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette in the Continental Army; however, no known documentation supports this account. Two years after he left the College of New Jersey (1778), Brown enrolled at The College of William &amp; Mary where he studied law. In the fall of 1780, his studies were interrupted by the War and the arrival of the British forces to the city. Brown continued to study law by &#x27;reading it&#x27; while working in the office of Thomas Jefferson near Charlottesville, Virginia.

==Family life==
Brown married Margaretta Mason, daughter of a Presbyterian minister of New York City, on February 21, 1799. They had five children together, only two of whom lived to adulthood:
*Mason Brown (November 10, 1799 – January 27, 1867) was born in Philadelphia. 
*Orlando (September 26, 1801 – July 26, 1867) was born at Liberty Hall. 
*Alfred was born at Liberty Hall on February 23, 1803, and died on January 29, 1804; 
*a second Alfred was born on May 9, 1804, and died on July 30, 1805. 
*Euphemia Helen, their youngest child and only daughter, was born on May 24, 1807. She died of a calomiel overdose on October 1, 1814.

In 1810 Margaretta Brown and other women took over the teaching of the first Sunday School west of the Alleghenies (the first was established in Pittsburgh a year before) - this was for boys only. In 1816, the Browns helped found Frankfort&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church; and, three years later, Margaretta Brown became the first superintendent of a Sabbath school for girls. In 1824, Margaretta Brown published &quot;Food for Lambs or Familiar Explanations of Some Religious Terms&quot; for her students to use.

Descendants of John and Margaretta Brown include Senator Benjamin Gratz Brown, the 20th governor of Missouri and vice presidential candidate in the 1872 election, and children&#x27;s author Margaret Wise Brown.

==Politics==

===Secret mission===
In May 1783 the young John Brown was commissioned by Robert Morris, Superintendent of Finance and President of the Secret Committee of Foreign Affairs Correspondence of the US government to visit Luis de Unzaga &quot;le Conciliateur&quot;, who served him as an intermediary in his secret mission to free the trade with the United States thanks to bills of exchange from the bankers Le Couteulx. Brown&#x27;s secret mission was a failure because of a &quot;want of confidence&quot; by Spanish officials in Cuba regarding American financial stability.

===Virginia legislature===
Brown became politically active after being admitted to the bar. He was elected to the Virginia state Senate, succeeding William Christian, where he served from 1783 to 1788. He was succeeded by William Russell.

The Virginia legislature sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 and 1788. When the U.S. Constitution became effective, Brown was twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1789 to 1792.

===Kentucky statehood and Senate tenure===
As a Congressman representing Virginia, Brown introduced the petition for Kentucky Statehood. When Kentucky became a state in 1792, he resigned from the House on June 1, 1792. On June 18, the Kentucky legislature elected him to the United States Senate (as was the practice then) for a term ending in 1793. He was re-elected twice and served until 1805. He was President pro tem during the Eighth Congress. During Brown&#x27;s Senate service, he moved to Frankfort, Kentucky, the capital of the state.

Brown was one of four senators to oppose authorizing military force for the Quasi-War. 

==Other works==
In 1805, Brown was defeated for re-election to the Senate and retired to Liberty Hall. He remained active in a number of public matters for the remaining thirty years of his life. In 1800, he purchased a ferry that crossed the Kentucky River at Frankfort. Brown managed large areas of property in central Kentucky and near Chillicothe, Ohio. He was a founding member of the Frankfort Water Company and director of the first Bank of Kentucky.

In 1812 Brown was appointed by the legislature to oversee the construction of a public house of worship on the public square of Frankfort. In 1829 Brown was elected as the Sheriff of Franklin County.

He also served on the board that oversaw the construction of the brick Capitol building and the limestone one that replaced it (now known as the Old Capitol). In 1836, Brown presided over the organizational meeting of the Kentucky Historical Society.

==Liberty Hall==
John Brown died on August 29, 1837, in Lexington, Kentucky, at age 79, and was brought to Frankfort for burial. In 1847, he was re-interred in the Frankfort Cemetery.

The home he occupied in his later years is preserved as Liberty Hall Historic Site located at 202 Wilkinson Street in Frankfort. The site contains two houses: Liberty Hall (1796) built by John Brown, and the Orlando Brown House (1835), designed by Gideon Shryock, and owned by Senator Brown&#x27;s second son. Liberty Hall is operated as a house museum and is open to the public. Liberty Hall Historic Site is a 501(c)3 organization owned and operated by Liberty Hall, Inc., and The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

<doc id="701252" wikidata="Q777907" url="?curid=701252" title="Shenandoah River">
<text>The Shenandoah River is the principal tributary of the Potomac River, long with two forks approximately long each, in the U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia. The river and its tributaries drain the central and lower Shenandoah Valley and the Page Valley in the Appalachians on the west side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, in northwestern Virginia and the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. There is a hydroelectric plant along the Shenandoah River constructed in 2014 by Dominion.

==Course==
The Shenandoah River is formed northeast of Front Royal near Riverton, by the confluence of the South Fork and the North Fork. It flows northeast across Warren County, passing underneath Interstate 66 from its formation. Beyond the I-66 bridge, the river flows through a set of bends before turning to the northeast again, crossing into Clarke County below I-66. Five miles (8 km) downriver from the Clarke County border, the Shenandoah passes under U.S. Route 50 and then passes through a triple bend. below the Route 50 bridge, the river passes underneath State Route 7 and then continues northeast another where it crosses into Jefferson County in West Virginia. Once in West Virginia, the river completes six large bends before joining the Potomac from the southwest near Harpers Ferry. The confluence is on the West Virginia-Maryland border, and from the Virginia-West Virginia border.

==Geology==

The Shenandoah Valley is underlaid by limestone. The fertile soil made it a favored place for early settlement. It remains a major agricultural area of Virginia and West Virginia. Some karst topography is evident, and the limestone is honeycombed with caves. Several have been developed as commercial tourist attractions, including Luray Caverns, Shenandoah Caverns, and Skyline Caverns.

On the riverbank, a few miles above Harper&#x27;s Ferry, is said to be a cave with an opening just large enough for a mounted rider to squeeze through. It widened in the interior to a spacious room where hundreds of Col. John Mosby&#x27;s raiding troops are said to have hidden from pursuing Union cavalry.

==Environmental issues==

===Mercury contamination===
The Shenandoah River was contaminated with mercury which was released by a DuPont rayon manufacturing facility located in Waynesboro, Virginia from 1929 to 1950. This mercury is still present in the fish population of the river today; data collected over the last several decades shows that mercury levels remain stable. The fish in many sections of the Shenandoah River are not safe for human consumption. For example, the Virginia Department of Health (VDOH) states that it is not safe to consume any species except trout which are caught between Waynesboro and Grottoes, Virginia due to elevated mercury levels. In general, the VDOH states that it is not safe to consume more than two fish per month which are caught on the Shenandoah River in Page, Warren, Augusta, or Rockingham counties.

In 2017 DuPont agreed to pay $42,069,916.78 to address natural resource damages and to implement restoration projects related to the impacted resources in the South Fork Shenandoah River watershed.

===Fish kills===
Since 2005, the Shenandoah River has experienced several springtime fish kills that have affected several of its native fish species. In 2005, redbreast sunfish and smallmouth bass along a stretch of the South Fork Shenandoah River began dying of lesions caused by bacteria and fungi. Although the fish kill eventually wiped out 80% of the adult redbreast sunfish and smallmouth bass, juvenile populations appeared to be unaffected. The following year more-localized fish kills in Clarke County spread to two of the Shenandoah&#x27;s three species of sucker: the shorthead redhorse and the northern hogsucker – the former suffering from similar lesions witnessed in the previous year&#x27;s fish kill. Virginia&#x27;s Department of Environmental Quality received reports of fish kills near Elkton and between Bentonville and Front Royal in late April 2007 and observed fish exhibiting lesions and strange behavior.

==Etymology==

Various accounts tell the origin of the name. According to one, General George Washington named the valley (and river) in honor of Skenandoa (or Shenandoah), an Oneida &quot;pine tree chief&quot; based in New York, who led hundreds of Oneida and Tuscarora warriors in support of the American rebels on the frontier during the Revolutionary War. He also sent much needed corn to Washington and his troops during their hard winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania in 1777–1778. However, the name was in use when Washington was a child, as evidenced in land grants and correspondence.

It is also said to be named after the Senedo people, a little-documented tribe said to have lived on the north fork of the river and destroyed by the Catawba, some time between 1650 and 1700.

==Recreation==
The Shenandoah River is a very popular river for canoeing, river tubing, and white-water recreation such as rafting and kayaking (class I-III in season, II-III+ during the spring run-off), and several commercial outfitters offer a variety of guided trips and rentals.

==South Fork Shenandoah River==
The South Fork is formed at Port Republic in southern Rockingham County, by the confluence of the North River and South River. It flows northeast in a tight meandering course, past Elkton and Shenandoah, through Page Valley, with the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east and the Massanutten Mountain range to the west.

==North Fork Shenandoah River==
The North Fork is long and rises in northern Rockingham County, along the eastern flank of Shenandoah Mountain in the George Washington National Forest. At its formation, the principal feeder on the North Fork is the German River.

The North Fork flows initially southeast, down from the mountains, then northeast through a valley across Shenandoah County, along the western side of Massanutten Mountain. It flows past Woodstock and Strasburg. On the north end of the ridge it turns briefly southeast to join the South Fork from the northwest to form the Shenandoah.

==In culture==

The American folk song and river and sea chantey titled &quot;Oh Shenandoah&quot; has been adapted to explicitly reference the river or river valley, although earlier versions referred to the 18th century Oneida Chief Shenandoah and the Missouri River, 1,000 miles to the west.

The 1971 hit and signature song of John Denver, &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, prominently mentions the Shenandoah River, and was adopted by the state of West Virginia in 2014 as its fourth official state song.

An episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, continuing the tradition of naming their runabout vessels after rivers, has a shuttle named Shenandoah.
