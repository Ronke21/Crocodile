<text>Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. This is commonly used for network appliances that require monitoring of network traffic such as an intrusion detection system, passive probe or real user monitoring (RUM) technology that is used to support application performance management (APM). Port mirroring on a Cisco Systems switch is generally referred to as &quot;Switched Port Analyzer&quot; (SPAN) or &quot;Remote Switched Port Analyzer&quot; (RSPAN). Other vendors have different names for it, such as &quot;Roving Analysis Port&quot; (RAP) on 3Com switches.

Network engineers or administrators use port mirroring to analyze and debug data or diagnose errors on a network. It helps administrators keep a close eye on network performance and alerts them when problems occur. It can be used to mirror either inbound or outbound traffic (or both) on single or multiple interfaces.

<text>AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center (commonly called as AFI Silver) is a three-screen movie theater complex in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland, north of Washington, D.C. It is operated by the American Film Institute.

It occupies the former home of the 1,100-seat Silver Theatre, whose 1938 building was designed by movie palace architect John Eberson. The Silver Theatre closed in 1985, and the building stood empty until 2001, when restoration began. 

As of 2017, the theater now shows &quot;upward of 600 movies per year&quot; including &quot;first-run features, classics, obscure archival prints, rarities from global cinema and the odd locally made one-off&quot;.

Its main auditorium hosts the DC Metro area&#x27;s third-largest commercial movie theater screen, and the second-largest commercial movie theater screen outside of the Smithsonian Institution after the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park.

From 2003 to 2022, the theater hosted an annual documentary festival called Silverdocs and then AFI Docs.

<text>Brasso is a metal polish designed to remove tarnish from brass, copper, chrome and stainless steel. It is available either directly as a liquid or as an impregnated wadding pad also known as Duraglit.

==History==
Brasso originated in Britain in about 1905. Reckitt &amp; Sons&#x27; senior traveller, W. H. Slack, visited the company&#x27;s Australian branch, where he discovered such a product in use. Samples from Australian and US producers were then analysed by Reckitt&#x27;s chemists, and by 1920 liquid polish under the trademark &quot;Brasso&quot; was being sold, initially to railways, hospitals, hotels, and large shops.

Because of the hydrocarbon components in the mixture it had a flash point of 72 °F (22 °C) (Abel Close test) and so was classed by railway companies as dangerous goods. This classification allowed the railway companies to charge more for distributing Brasso around the country. Reckitt&#x27;s appealed to the companies asking for the polish to be recategorized in the hope of reducing costs, but the railways disagreed. As a result of this in 1913 the case was taken to the Railway and Canal Commissioners for a decision. After a hearing lasting two days the commissioners decided in favour of the railway companies, and Brasso remained classed as a dangerous substance for the purposes of railway transport.

The polish grew in popularity in Britain, becoming widely available, eventually replacing the previous paste-style polishes. It has undergone very few changes in either composition or package design over the past century. Cans are often collected as a typical example of classic British advertising design.

In the US, the current Brasso product is not the same as the legacy product. The manufacturer, Reckitt Benckiser, has not produced the impregnated wadding version of the product for many years. The formula changed in 2008 to comply with US volatile organic compounds law, and the metal bottle was replaced by a plastic one.

In 2010, Brasso brought out a new product, Brasso Gadgetcare. Gadgetcare is a versatile, non-abrasive gel that can be used on everything from LCD TV screens, laptop screens, computers, smart phones, and PDAs. The plastic bottle is 50ml and is sold with a microfibre cloth.

==Ingredients==
The label of Australian Brasso lists &quot;Liquid Hydrocarbons 630g/L; Ammonia 7g/L&quot;, whereas the material safety data sheet for Brasso in North America lists: isopropyl alcohol 3–5%, ammonia 5–10%, silica powder 15–20% and oxalic acid 0–3% as the ingredients. The Australian version also contains silica (silicon dioxide) for abrasives.

The online data sheet for Brasso wadding in the UK lists the ingredients as C8–10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, C14–18 and C16–18 unsaturated Fatty acids, Kaolinite, Aqua, Ammonium Hydroxide and Iron Hydroxide. Brasso liquid lists a slightly different mix; C8–10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Kaolin, C12–20 Saturated and Unsaturated Monobasic Fatty Acids, Aqua and Ammonium Hydroxide. Also available are ingredients in a discontinued recipe for Brasso. Wadding: C8–10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Ammonium Tallate and Colorant. Liquid: C8–10 Alkane/Cycloalkane/Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Quartz, Kaolin and Ammonium Tallate.

Brasso is abrasive and will wear metal over time. The National Trust recommend alternative cleaners.

== Other applications ==
Brasso has also been used to polish out scratches in plastics:
*It has been used to polish CDs, DVDs, screens, and pools to repair scratches. It is a mild solvent and an extremely fine abrasive, so when applied to the reflective surface of the disc and rubbed radially (in straight lines between the edge and centre), it can smooth scratches and reduce their effect.
*Brasso has been used on Lego minifigures to remove markings.
*Brasso has been used by watch enthusiasts to polish scratches out of acrylic crystals on watches.

Brasso has been successfully used to take minor (white) heat marks out of French polished wooden surfaces. The fine abrasive cuts through the surface and allows the solvent into the wax and lacquer layer. The surface should be properly cleaned and waxed after this treatment.

Brasso has been successfully used to restore Bakelite (telephones, appliances, etc.).

Brasso, on account of its ammonia content, has been used as a de-coppering agent in rifle barrels to remove copper fouling.

<doc id="702722" wikidata="Q1165414" url="?curid=702722" title="Mark Greene">
<text>Mark Greene, M.D. is a fictional character from the American medical drama series &quot;ER&quot;. Portrayed by actor Anthony Edwards, he first appeared in the series&#x27; pilot episode, as well as subsequently appearing as one of the principal characters until the end of the eighth season. Edwards later returned to make a guest appearance in the fifteenth season episode &quot;Heal Thyself&quot;.

Considered to be the lead protagonist of the series’ first eight seasons, Greene&#x27;s role was that of a mediator and occasional authority figure. He begins the series as the ER&#x27;s chief resident, before being promoted to an attending physician. He became the only member of the original set of main characters who died during the series.

==Character background==

Mark Greene, an only child, was raised by his mother, Ruth (portrayed by Bonnie Bartlett), and father, David (portrayed by John Cullum). David Greene served in the United States Navy, and thus the family moved frequently and lived all over the country, including Jacksonville, Florida, Norfolk, Virginia, Corpus Christi, Texas, Washington D.C., Kings Bay, Georgia, and Hawaii, where they spent three years, David&#x27;s longest assignment. Greene had a very strained relationship with his father, and was decidedly closer to his mother. Greene would often act out in an attempt to upset his father and aimed his goals at the opposite of what his father wanted. Mark thought his father&#x27;s Navy career mattered more to him than his family, only to later learn that David was on track to be an admiral and turned down the chance in order to come home and help Mark deal with a bully. The most memorable time of his childhood was when his family was in Hawaii, a time he would later recreate with his daughter Rachel during the last few weeks of his life.

While still in high school, Greene met and soon after developed a romantic relationship with Jennifer (Jen). Presumably, their relationship lasted the duration of their time in college, and at some point around the time Greene was at medical school, he married Jennifer. His daughter Rachel was born shortly afterward. While in medical school, he met future colleague Doug Ross. Greene then completed his internship and residency in the Emergency Department of County General Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, and from there he was awarded the position of Chief Resident of the Emergency Department. While there, Greene developed close friendships with Dr. Susan Lewis, an ER resident, and nurse manager, Carol Hathaway, as well as continuing his close friendship with Doug Ross, now a pediatrician. Although Greene enjoys working the ER, his marriage has been strained by the many nights on call, the long hours, and his wife Jen&#x27;s decision to complete law school.

==History ==
In the pilot episode, which takes place on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1994, Dr. Greene, the chief resident, is awakened in the first scene to help his long-time friend Doug, the emergency pediatric fellow who often comes in to sober up on his nights off. Also, his close friendship with Susan is shown as they confide in each other about their personal lives while on break.

During the same episode, Jen gets Mark to visit a private practice near the hospital to explore the possibility of leaving his job at the ER and getting more family-friendly hours. Greene decides the &quot;clean&quot; medicine isn&#x27;t his cup of tea. Back at the ER, Greene removes a hangnail from an older woman, who wanted him to remove it despite the fact she&#x27;d be charged $180. Later during the night, Greene has to urge everyone to get back to work when Carol is rushed into the ER after a shocking suicide attempt.

During the first season, Dr. Greene&#x27;s marriage becomes increasingly shaky. When offered an attending physician&#x27;s position by David Morgenstern, Greene readily accepts, much to Jen&#x27;s chagrin. As a newly admitted member of the bar, Jen has been clerking for a judge in Milwaukee and becomes increasingly tired of commuting and living separately to accommodate Greene&#x27;s job. She begins an affair with a coworker, and the marriage soon ends, with Rachel and Jen leaving Chicago first for Milwaukee and later for St. Louis.

In &quot;Love&#x27;s Labor Lost&quot;, Greene makes miscalculations in treating a pregnant woman that leads to her death in childbirth, and the after-effects of this case linger long into Season 2.

In &quot;A Miracle Happens Here&quot;, a Christmas episode, Greene explains that he is the son of an agnostic Jew and a lapsed Catholic. He lights a Hanukkah candle for a Holocaust survivor. Greene understands some Yiddish.

Greene&#x27;s career becomes more difficult as he needs to make decisions that periodically alienate his friends, such as selecting Dr. Kerry Weaver for Chief Resident over another applicant, angering Susan Lewis as the other applicant is a good friend of hers and she dislikes Weaver&#x27;s harsh attitude. Greene&#x27;s friendship with Dr. Ross becomes strained as his administrative tasks often put him at odds with Doug&#x27;s wild ways and he is disgusted by Doug&#x27;s personal problems to the point where he briefly overrules and belittles Doug&#x27;s abilities as a physician before reconciling with his friend.

His love life takes another downward spin when his feelings for Dr. Lewis increase, but she leaves the hospital for a job in Phoenix, Arizona. He suffers emotionally again after he is brutally beaten in the ER men&#x27;s room in the episode &quot;Random Acts&quot;. The attack is initially believed to have been carried out by Chris Law in retaliation to avenge the death of his brother, who had been treated by Dr. Greene for a gunshot wound. Law claims Dr. Greene failed to save his brother’s life because of his race, as Greene had assumed he and his brother were gangbangers. Later, it is implied that his assailant was a psychotic individual who was randomly attacking doctors. The real assailant is never caught.

After the attack in Season 3, Greene buys a gun and, in an extremely uncharacteristic moment, pulls the gun on a group of teenagers who were harassing and following him on a train platform; soon after he throws it in the river. He struggles through a large part of Season 4 but comes to terms with his attack in Season 5 when he helps Nigerian-born janitor Mobilage Ekabo reveal his memories of torture by talking about the attack with him, allowing him to obtain political asylum and avoid deportation.

With the passing of Doug&#x27;s father comes the re-entrance of Mark&#x27;s parents. He and Doug travel to California to settle Doug&#x27;s father&#x27;s affairs (Doug&#x27;s father and new wife were both killed in a motor vehicle accident), and take a side trip to visit Mark&#x27;s parents, who live in another part of California. His relationship with his father David is still strained, and his mother suffers from a string of medical conditions associated with aging. Mark also finds out that his mother viewed his birth as a mistake, as she didn&#x27;t know his father well and got married quickly when she got pregnant. Mark&#x27;s distrust of the Navy puts him at odds with David when he and Mark fight over whether Ruth should be treated in a base hospital or a civilian hospital. Ruth eventually dies and Mark goes to her funeral, leaving him on edge when he clashes with Kerry Weaver over Robert Romano&#x27;s successful drive for the chief of staff position.

Greene&#x27;s personal life after his marriage ends is tumultuous. He follows in Doug&#x27;s playboy footsteps, having several flings and an affair with Nurse Chuny Marquez, and setting up three dates in one day. He has a brief relationship with a needy desk clerk, Cynthia Hooper (played by Mariska Hargitay in season 4). Hooper leaves him after she finds out Greene doesn&#x27;t really love her. Greene eventually meets British surgeon, Elizabeth Corday. Corday is in Chicago on an exchange program, under the guidance of Dr. Romano. Romano&#x27;s advances on Corday fail, as does her relationship with Peter Benton. Eventually, Greene and Elizabeth begin dating in Season 5, finally forming a stable and happy relationship.

During Season 6, Greene discovers that his father is suffering from advanced lung cancer. After David realizes that he can no longer live alone, he moves to Chicago and stays with Mark. After an awkward first meeting, he warms up to Elizabeth very quickly. Father and son reach an emotional bonding that heals the difficult relationship from Mark&#x27;s youth, and David eventually succumbs to his cancer.

Mark and Elizabeth begin a more serious relationship and move in together. Greene later buys a house, and he and Elizabeth get married and have a daughter, Ella. Their happiness is threatened, though, when the abusive father of a patient goes on a killing rampage after losing his son to social workers. In a bid to get his son back, he kills and injures a number of people and attempts to go after Elizabeth and Ella.

After being shot by an armed bystander, he is brought to the ER. During his treatment, Greene takes him aboard an elevator to go to an operating room. The patient goes into cardiac arrest when alone in the elevator with Greene, who withholds defibrillation and allows him to go into ventricular fibrillation and die. He later falsifies records to show that he did attempt to save the patient. Elizabeth suspects what Mark did but lets the matter drop.

Later, Rachel appears in Chicago unannounced, citing arguments with her mother, and moves in with Mark and a very reluctant Elizabeth. Rachel&#x27;s reckless behavior and drug use lead to Ella, still, an infant, overdosing in season 8, putting a heavy strain on Mark and Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage.

==Character illness and death==
While suturing a patient&#x27;s wound, Greene loses control of his faculties and is temporarily unable to speak. After a CT scan and a biopsy, he is diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, that is thought to be inoperable. Embarrassed, Greene briefly tries to hide his condition, but his cover is blown when he has a seizure while arguing with Carter.

With little time, Greene seeks a second opinion from an eminent New York City neurosurgeon, Dr. Burke. Greene is told that the tumor is near a critical section of his brain but hasn&#x27;t &quot;invaded&quot; it yet and they can perform an operation on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000. Greene&#x27;s surgery is performed by Burke and things appear to be positive, although it takes him a while to return to his old self. A year or so later, however, Greene finds out his tumor has returned, and Dr. Burke both confirms this and says he cannot operate again because the tumor regrowth is now in part of his brain where an operation would render Greene completely vegetative. While chemotherapy treatment will only allow Greene to live for another 5–6 months, Burke points out: &quot;You should have been dead a year ago, Mark. You got married, saw your daughter be born - I&#x27;d say that was time well spent.&quot;

At this point, Rachel has run away from Jen in St. Louis and is staying with Mark and Elizabeth. Though she vehemently denies it, her recreational drug use becomes apparent when her baby sister Ella gets hold of some ecstasy in her backpack and nearly dies after ingesting it in the episode &quot;Damage is Done&quot;.

When Rachel shows up, Mark can barely control his anger at her, berating her for repeatedly for lying to him and for putting Ella in danger. However, he sees her remorse and fear for Ella are genuine. Knowing that Elizabeth is angry enough for both of them, he hugs Rachel when she starts to cry. When Mark refuses to throw Rachel out of the house, Elizabeth says she won&#x27;t return home with Ella as long as Rachel is there and leaves home with Ella and moves into a hotel. Unwilling to tell Elizabeth about his condition, Mark stays with Susan during the course of his chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Elizabeth later finds out the truth and wants to come home, but Mark tells her she shouldn&#x27;t pretend to be his wife just because he&#x27;s sick. However, she returns anyway and begins helping Mark as his terminal illness advances. Mark suffers more medical problems and his time in the ER comes to an end.

Eventually, however, he resigns himself to his fate and decides to halt the debilitating chemotherapy, deciding he would rather have three good final months than twice that suffering from his treatments.

On his last day in the ER, he meets with the same older woman that viewers saw on the first episode of &quot;ER&quot;. She again has a hangnail and complains about how painful it is. Greene tells her that he has an inoperable tumor, asks another doctor to treat her, and tells the patient not to return to the ER again. He leaves the ER, stops his chemotherapy treatments, tells John Carter that &quot;he&quot; will now &quot;set the tone&quot; and takes Rachel on a last-minute trip to Hawaii to rebuild his relationship with her and relive happier times.

After several moves around the island and some conflict with a surly Rachel, Mark suffers from increased symptoms, including a seizure while walking with Rachel, prompting her to call Elizabeth, who comes to Hawaii with Ella. One night, Rachel comes to her father&#x27;s room while he sleeps. Mark awakens and smiles at Rachel, telling her with slurred speech that he was just dreaming of her and how she used to love balloons. He tells her that he was trying to think of a piece of advice that every father should tell his daughter, and tells her to be generous with her time, her love, and her life. Rachel tells her father that she remembers a lullaby that Mark used to sing her when she was a baby and slips a pair of headphones on his head and plays Israel Kamakawiwo&#x27;ole&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; for him as he smiles and falls back asleep. While the song plays, he is seen walking through an empty ER. The next morning, Elizabeth discovers that he has died.

In the episode &quot;The Letter&quot;, Carter discovers two faxes that had arrived earlier, both sent by Elizabeth. He reads the first one to the staff. It is a letter that Greene had written about his sentiments about the Chicago County ER where he had worked for many years, and the staff he had worked with throughout the years. They begin happily discussing his letter until Lewis notices that Carter is holding the second fax, visibly upset. He informs them that the second is a brief letter written by Elizabeth, notifying them that Mark had died that morning around 6 A.M., &quot;… at sunrise, his favorite time of the day.&quot;

She explains that she sent the first letter to show the staff at the ER what he thought of them. As the staff responds sadly to this news, Frank asks if he should post the second fax on the staff bulletin board, and Carter tells him to post both of them. The letter and the news of his passing send many of the ER&#x27;s staff that day into emotional turmoil, with Kerry Weaver going from second-guessing Abby&#x27;s posting of the letter (she quickly changes her mind and says it should stay up) to crying and stating her regrets to Sandy Lopez that she&#x27;s lost a friend. This portion of the episode closely models the scene at the end of the film &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, when Jack Lemmon&#x27;s character, Ensign Pulver, reads two similar letters connected with the title character&#x27;s death. It was also revealed in the episode by Susan Lewis that he died at the age of 38, making his birth year-end 1963 or 1964.

At the close of the episode, as the staff rush out to the ambulance bay to handle incoming casualties, the wind blowing through the open door tears one page of Greene&#x27;s letter off the bulletin board.

Greene&#x27;s body is returned to Chicago, where he is buried. Many of his friends and colleagues come to the funeral: John Carter, Peter Benton, Kerry Weaver, Abby Lockhart, Luka Kovač, Susan Lewis, Jing-Mei Chen, Robert Romano, Jerry Markovic, Lydia Wright, Frank Martin, Donald Anspaugh, William &quot;Wild Willy&quot; Swift (played by Michael Ironside in 1994), Haleh Adams, Michael Gallant, Cleo Finch, Jen, Rachel, Ella, and Elizabeth.

After the funeral, Rachel asks Elizabeth if she can visit to see Ella; Elizabeth responds &quot;Of course, she&#x27;s your sister.&quot; Rachel then suddenly asks the driver to pull over: she walks to a bunch of balloons attached to a fence, takes a purple one, and slowly lets go of it, watching it rise toward the sky.

Rachel goes back to living with her mother in St. Louis but later returns to Chicago when the time comes to select a college, as well as asking a bemused Elizabeth to help her acquire effective birth control pills.

In the April 2009 &quot;ER&quot; series finale, Rachel returns to County General to interview for a position as a med student, showing that she has become a responsible young woman and followed in Mark&#x27;s footsteps.

==Epilogue==
It was reported that Dr. Mark Greene was written out of the series because actor Anthony Edwards had decided that he wanted to move on to other opportunities and spend time with his family.

In season 9, episode 2, Elizabeth Corday is grieving his death. She becomes emotional when she enters the doctors&#x27; lounge and sees a photograph of him smiling with some of the hospital staff before his death. Greene was also shown in an old Christmas photo in Season 10&#x27;s &quot;Freefall,&quot; alongside Drs. Lockhart, Lewis, Carter, and Kovac. He appears in photos included in the slideshow shown at Dr. Carter&#x27;s farewell party in the Season 11 episode &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;.

Greene was also heard in a voice-over telling Carter that he needed to &quot;set the tone&quot; in the ER (as Dr. Morgenstern told Dr. Greene in the pilot episode).

In the Season 12 episode &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; he is mentioned during a flashback to 2002, when Dr. Pratt tells patient Nate Lennox (James Woods) that the reason the ER has few staff working is because they are at Greene&#x27;s funeral.

In Season 14&#x27;s &quot;Blackout,&quot; Nurse Chuny Marquez expresses incredulity that the ER will be led by young physicians Dr. Pratt and Dr. Morris, versus Dr. Greene and Dr. Ross. Nurse Samantha Taggart, who only started working at County General after Dr. Greene&#x27;s and Dr. Ross&#x27;s tenures, asks, poignantly, &quot;Who?&quot;

== Return to the series ==
In 2008, &quot;ER&quot; producers announced that Edwards would reprise his role for the series&#x27; final season, with Dr. Greene appearing in flashbacks in the episode &quot;Heal Thyself&quot; shedding light on Dr. Catherine Banfield&#x27;s (played by Angela Bassett) past.

On November 13, 2008, over six years after his exit from the show, Anthony Edwards returned as Dr. Mark Greene. The flashback episode took place in 2002, just months before Greene&#x27;s death, and revealed an encounter he had with Catherine Banfield, six years before she began working in that same emergency room. He was treating Banfield&#x27;s son Darryl who had a debilitating disease that turned out to be leukemia. The story appeared to take place at the point in Season 8 when Mark and Elizabeth were reconciling after she learned his tumor had recurred. Greene takes on the mysterious case to save the 5-year-old. He has a run-in with Kerry Weaver and Robert Romano about putting this case ahead of his chemo treatment which took a toll on him throughout that day. Darryl dies in the ER but it was Greene&#x27;s heroic actions that triggered Catherine in the present day to help save a young girl from drowning and may have also inspired her to work full-time at County. During their encounter, Cate kept pressing Greene, who told her to stop being a doctor and to start being a mother. Cate gave the same advice to the young girl&#x27;s mother.

In the season 15 episode &quot;The Book of Abby&quot;, long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag &quot;Greene&quot; can be seen.

<doc id="702734" wikidata="Q1699782" url="?curid=702734" title="John Day River">
<text>The John Day River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northeastern Oregon in the United States. It is known as the Mah-Hah River by the Cayuse people. Undammed along its entire length, the river is the fourth longest free-flowing river in the contiguous United States. There is extensive use of its waters for irrigation. Its course furnishes habitat for diverse species, including wild steelhead and Chinook salmon runs. However, the steelhead populations are under federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections, and the Chinook salmon have been proposed for such protection.

The river was named for John Day, a member of the Pacific Fur Company&#x27;s overland expedition to the mouth of the Columbia River that left Missouri in 1810. Day struggled through eastern Oregon during the winter of 1811–12. While descending the Columbia River in April 1812, he and Ramsay Crooks were robbed and stripped naked by Native Americans at the mouth of the river that now bears his name, forcing them to hike back to friendly Umatilla Indians under extreme conditions.

The absence of dams on the river causes its flow to greatly fluctuate throughout the year depending on snowpack and rainfall within the watershed. The highest flow recorded at a gauge on the lower John Day was on January 2, 1997. The lowest flow was no flow at all, which occurred on September 2, 1966; from August 15 to September 16, 1973; and on nine days in August 1977. The average flow at the gauge is .

==Drainage basin==
Through its tributaries, the river drains much of the western side of the Blue Mountains, flowing across the sparsely populated arid part of the state east of the Cascade Range in a northwest zigzag, then entering the Columbia upstream from the Columbia River Gorge. It flows through exceptionally scenic canyons in its upper course, with several significant paleontological sites along its banks. Elevations within the watershed range from at the river&#x27;s mouth to more than in the Strawberry Mountains.

The main branch of the John Day River rises in the Strawberry Mountains in eastern Grant County. The North Fork heads on the western slope of the Elkhorn Mountains in northeastern Grant County. The Middle Fork rises near the crest of the Blue Mountains on the eastern edge of Grant County. The South Fork&#x27;s source is in northern Harney County, about south of the Grant County line. The main, south and middle forks each have their heads in different parts of the Malheur National Forest, while the North Fork&#x27;s source is located in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The main fork flows initially north, then west through the John Day Valley and through the cities of Prairie City, John Day and Mount Vernon. At Dayville, in western Grant County, it is joined from the south by the South Fork John Day River, then flows north through Picture Gorge and the Sheep Rock Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.

At Kimberly in northwestern Grant County, it is joined from the east by the North Fork John Day River (which had already joined with the Middle Fork John Day River above Monument, Grant County, Oregon). The river then flows west across Wheeler County. At the county line with Jefferson County it flows north, past the Clarno Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. As it approaches the Columbia River in north-central Oregon, it flows in an increasingly meandering course, forming the boundary between Sherman County to the west and Gilliam County to the east.

The John Day River joins the Columbia from the southeast approximately northeast of Biggs. The mouth of the river is on the narrow Lake Umatilla reservoir, formed on the Columbia by the John Day Dam, approximately downstream from the mouth of the John Day.

==Recreation and ecosystem==
The John Day is navigable by rafts and other small river craft by boaters who obtain permits provided by the Bureau of Land Management.

Its lower course is used for irrigation of cropland and ranching. In 1988, the United States Congress designated of the river from Service Creek to Tumwater Falls as Wild and Scenic for its recreational opportunities. The segment of the river is a popular destination for anadromous steelhead and warm water bass fishing, as well as whitewater rafting.

In addition to wild spring chinook salmon and bass, the river furnishes habitat for Columbia River redband trout, bull trout, and westslope cutthroat trout. There are no hatchery salmon or steelhead released in the John Day River.

<text>William Jennings Bryan Herman (July 7, 1909 – September 5, 1992) was an American second baseman and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) during the 1930s and 1940s. Known for his stellar defense and consistent batting, Herman still holds many National League (NL) defensive records for second basemen and was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in New Albany, Indiana, in 1909, and named after William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate and statesman of the turn of the 20th century, Herman attended New Albany High School.

===Baseball career===
Herman broke into the majors in with the Chicago Cubs and asserted himself as a star the following season, , by hitting .314 and scoring 102 runs. His first at-bat was memorable. Facing Cincinnati Reds pitcher Si Johnson, Herman chopped a pitch into the back of home plate, which then bounced up and hit Herman in the back of the head, knocking him out. A fixture in the Chicago lineup over the next decade, Herman was a consistent hitter and solid producer. He regularly hit .300 or higher (and as high as .341 in ) and drove in a high of 93 runs in . He also hit 57 doubles in both and .
After a sub-standard offensive year in , Herman was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers in . He had one of his finest offensive season in , when he batted .330 with a .398 on-base percentage and 100 runs driven in.

Herman missed the and seasons to serve in World War II, but returned to play in with the Dodgers and Boston Braves (after being traded mid-season). At 37, he was considered prime managerial material by the new owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates. On September 30, 1946, Herman was traded to Pittsburgh with three marginal players (outfielder Stan Wentzel, pitcher Elmer Singleton and infielder Whitey Wietelmann) for third baseman Bob Elliott and catcher Hank Camelli. Herman was promptly named playing manager of the 1947 Pirates, but he was aghast at the cost—Elliott—the Pirates had paid for him. &quot;Why, they&#x27;ve gone and traded the whole team on me&quot;, he said. Elliott won the NL Most Valuable Player award and led Boston to the 1948 National League pennant. Herman&#x27;s 1947 Pirates lost 92 games and finished tied for seventh in the NL, and he resigned before the season&#x27;s final game. (His last appearance as a Major League player was on August 1 of that year.)

Herman then managed in the minor leagues and became a Major League coach with the Dodgers (1952–57) and Braves (now based in Milwaukee) (1958–59)—serving on five National League pennant winners in eight seasons. Then he moved to the American League (AL) as the third-base coach of the Boston Red Sox for five years (1960–64), before managing the Red Sox to lackluster records in and ; his 1965 Boston club lost 100 games. After his firing by the Red Sox in September 1966, he coached for the California Angels (1967) and San Diego Padres (1978–79) and served in player development roles with the Padres and Oakland Athletics.

Herman finished his 1,922-game big-league career with a .304 batting average, 1,163 runs scored, 2,345 hits, 486 doubles, 82 triples, 47 home runs, 839 runs batted in, 737 bases on balls and 428 strikeouts. Defensively, he recorded an overall .968 fielding percentage. He won four NL pennants (, , , and ) but no World Series championships as a player (although he was a coach on the 1955 World Series champion Brooklyn Dodgers). His record as a Major League manager was 189-274 (.408). Herman holds the NL records for most putouts in a season by a second baseman and led the league in putouts seven times. He also shares the Major League record for most hits on opening day, with five, set April 14, 1936.

===Later life===

Herman moved to Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in 1968. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in . He died of cancer in 1992.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Herman as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

===Personal===
Herman&#x27;s granddaughter is Cheri Daniels, wife of former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels.

<doc id="702761" wikidata="Q2670730" url="?curid=702761" title="Reverse psychology">
<text>Reverse psychology is a technique involving the assertion of a belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the persuasion to do what is actually desired. This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon of reactance, in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against. This may work especially well on a person who is resistant by nature, while direct requests work best for people who are compliant. The one being manipulated is usually unaware of what is really going on.

== Among adolescents ==
Susan Fowle writes, &quot;that such strategies [of reverse psychology] can backfire. Children can sense manipulation a mile away.&quot; She instead recommends leading by example.

Reverse psychology is often used on children due to their high tendency to respond with reactance, a desire to restore threatened freedom of action. Questions have, however been raised about such an approach when it is more than merely instrumental, in the sense that &quot;reverse psychology implies a clever manipulation of the misbehaving child&quot;.

The psychology professor John Gottman advises against using reverse psychology on teens on the presumption that they will rebel, stating that &quot;such strategies are confusing, manipulative, dishonest, and they rarely work.&quot; A typical example of using reverse psychology among adolescents is a parent openly disapproving of their child&#x27;s romantic relationship, with the objective being to encourage the pursuit of the opposite behavior.

This psychological approach has proven to be particularly effective with adolescents as many of these are prone to rebellious tendencies and will frequently behave in a manner antithetical to the advice of well-meaning authority figures.

== Psychological reactance theory ==
Reverse psychology can fall under many different psychological influence techniques. Reverse psychology is sometimes referred to as psychological reactance, the aroused state that occurs when freedom is threatened or eliminated. The higher stake or more freedoms that are threatened, the more arousal that can be expected. People prefer to be free to select what they like. When that freedom is taken away, they are motivated to restore it. Psychological reactance can be better explained as the idea that an item will be wanted more if people are told they cannot have it, which can relate to reverse psychology on some levels. Another influence technique that relates to reverse psychology is strategic self-anticonformity. Strategic self-anticonformity is when a person advocates a position opposite of their true thought while hiding the fact that they are using a persuasion tactic. A typical example of such is marketing techniques or tricks such as &quot;&quot;do not click this link&quot; or &quot;do not push this button&quot;.&quot; Strategic self-anticonformity and psychological reactance relate to their expected negativity or disagreeableness from their influence target.

==In psychotherapy==
Closely associated with reverse psychology in psychotherapy is the technique of &quot;the &quot;Paradoxical intervention&quot;...This technique has also been called &#x27;prescribing the symptom&#x27; and &#x27;antisuggestion. The therapist frames their message so that resistance to it promotes change.

Such interventions &quot;can have a similar impact as humour in helping clients cast their problems in a new light...By going &quot;with&quot;, not against, the client&#x27;s resistance, the therapist makes the behaviour less attractive&quot;. This is referred to as reframing. This means pretending to agree with clients&#x27; thoughts and beliefs; reaffirming them out loud to make them realize their fallibility.

== In relationships ==
In personal interpersonal relationships, reverse psychology can be implemented from two perspectives. On the one hand, it can be used as a manipulative &quot;persuasion tactic&quot; in a negative fashion. Alternatively, it can also be used as a helpful method to benefit relationships.

== Marketing and decision-making ==
Psychology is another word to refer to &quot;perception, analyzing and focusing on other people&#x27;s decisions.&quot; Throughout history, this has been utilized in many ways. A common one would be games. In certain card games, the idea is to make the person focus on the REVERSE of what they think they are paying attention to. 

Modern marketing and advertising strategies use similar techniques. Although these studies have not been consistently shown in laboratory settings, and the results are often inconclusive, reverse psychology is often considered a controversial topic, and results from experiments are not always consistent. Nevertheless, it has still profoundly impacted the study of perception in psychology and behavior.

==Paradoxical marketing==

&quot;In a world where it is expected that all things should be available ... less availability has emerged as a new selling point: by engaging in such a restricted anti-marketing ploy, the brand has won kudos.&quot; The result can be &quot;what the Japanese call a secret brand ... no regular retail outlets, no catalog, no web presence apart from a few cryptic mentions ... people like it because it&#x27;s almost impossible to find&quot;. Such an example of a brand is Cayce Pollard&#x27;s &quot;The Gabriel Hounds&quot;.

==Adorno and Horkheimer==
Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer characterized the effect of the culture industry as &quot;psychoanalysis in reverse&quot;. Their analysis began with the dialectic which operated in Germany when heirs of the Romantic movement became seekers of &quot;Strength through Joy&quot;, only to have their movement co-opted by a combination of the mass media and National Socialism. A modern example begins with the &quot;fitness and jogging&quot; boom in the United States in the 1970s. The &quot;running craze&quot; at the Boston Marathon and in California, dialectically, was the thesis that one did not have to be &quot;Rocky&quot; in a sweaty gym to be physically fit, and that body acceptance was the key to effective aerobic training. The culture industry responded to the thesis with major advertising campaigns from Calvin Klein and others, using images featuring exceptionally toned models. People compared themselves to these models, which created a sense of competition, and many high school students avoid jogging because of the resultant body shame. 
The culture industry mass-produces standardized material. This would not be dangerous if the material was meaningless, but it frequently offers and reinforces ideals and norms representing implied criticism of those who fail to match up. Empirical studies show that mass culture products can lower confidence and self-esteem, and cause humiliation among men and women whose particular characteristics fall outside the normalized range for appearance, behaviour, religion, ethnicity, etc. Similarly, advertising frequently seeks to create a need to buy by showing differences between &quot;actual&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; situations. The intention is usually to induce dissatisfaction with the present situation and to induce expectations of satisfaction through the acquisition of products that will transform the actual reality into the idealized reality. Hence, if the peer group buys, all those who cannot afford the products will feel additional unhappiness and frustration until they eventually join the group. Thus, sometimes the process of advocacy for one outcome intends to produce the opposite outcome as the motivation for purchase. 
However, more often than not, the cause and effect are unintended. Marxist logic applied to the culture industry indicates that it is, &quot;per se&quot;, a dialectic in which declining profit margins and increasing costs make investors anxious for &quot;sure things&quot;. Repeating winning formulas and stereotyping create the lowest common denominator products with the lowest costs. But the less creative the input, the more likely it becomes that roles will be cast in ways that match, rather than challenge, common prejudices which can inadvertently (or quite deliberately) damage the esteem of those in the marginalized groups.

==In popular culture==

Classic examples of reverse psychology in popular culture include a large, bright red button with a sign next to it saying &quot;Do not push&quot;, or a sign saying &quot;Jump at your own risk&quot;.

There are numerous examples of reverse psychology in fiction, cinema, and cartoons, including William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; where Mark Antony uses reverse psychology to get the townspeople to cause a riot. Mark Antony pretends to side with Brutus by complimenting his deeds which have led to Caesar&#x27;s murder, while actually inciting the crowd&#x27;s anger.

In one of Joel Chandler Harris&#x27;s Uncle Remus stories, Br&#x27;er Rabbit escaped from Br&#x27;er Fox by repeatedly pleading &quot;Please, Br&#x27;er Fox, don&#x27;t fling me in that briar patch.&quot; &quot;The fox did so, which allowed the rabbit to escape: The Rabbit used &#x27;reverse psychology&#x27; to outsmart the Fox.&quot;

In Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, Montresor uses reverse psychology to persuade Fortunato to enter his vaults. He says that Fortunato is too tired and should get some rest and that he should find someone else to help him with his wine tasting problem. Montresor knew that Fortunato would disagree and insisted on entering the vault, leading him into his death by immurement.

The Swedish fictional character Alfie Atkins uses reverse psychology in the children&#x27;s book &quot;You&#x27;re a Sly One, Alfie Atkins!&quot; from 1977. He exaggerates his own childishness in order to convince his older cousins to sit at the grown-up table.

One of the most famous examples of reverse psychology in popular culture is a gag in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;Rabbit Fire&quot;. While Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are arguing over whether it&#x27;s Duck Season or Rabbit Season, Bugs suddenly switches sides and says &quot;Rabbit Season&quot;, throwing Daffy off and resulting in him arguing for Duck Season, and getting himself shot.

In the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Eddie Valiant, in order to save Roger from being executed by Judge Doom, tricks him into drinking liquor (which Roger is allergic to) by using reverse psychology. It is done in the same manner as the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; example above, and it&#x27;s most likely a reference.

In the 1992 Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot;, the titular character, upon freeing the Genie from the lamp, uses reverse psychology to trick the Genie into freeing him from the Cave of Wonders, without using one of his three wishes to do so.

A popular example of reverse psychology in media is the release of Queen&#x27;s hit song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Upon release, the band was told the song was too long to ever be played on the radio, running at 5 minutes and 55 seconds. To overcome this, the band gave the song to Kenny Everett of Capital Radio and made him promise not to play it. Everett in fact did play the song, and the band&#x27;s plan worked, with the song becoming number one on the UK singles chart for nine weeks.

<doc id="702768" wikidata="Q326958" url="?curid=702768" title="Harry Hooper">
<text>Harry Bartholomew Hooper (August 24, 1887 – December 18, 1974) was an American professional baseball right fielder who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). Hooper batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Hooper was born in Bell Station, California, and he graduated from Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California. He played for major league teams between 1909 and 1925, spending most of that time with the Boston Red Sox and finishing his career with the Chicago White Sox.

Hooper was often known for his defensive skills, ranking among the league leaders in defensive categories such as putouts and assists by a right fielder. He is the all-time career leader in assists and double plays by a right fielder. During several seasons with Boston, he teamed up with Duffy Lewis and Tris Speaker to form the Golden Outfield, one of the best outfield trios in baseball history. Hooper is also one of only two members of four separate Red Sox World Series championship teams (1912, 1915, 1916, 1918). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

== Early life ==
Hooper was born on August 24, 1887, in Bell Station, California. His family had migrated to California as many other families from the United States due to the California Gold Rush. His father, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Hooper, was born in Morrell, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Joe was the fourth child and second boy born to English-born William Hooper, Harry&#x27;s grandfather, and his Portuguese wife Louisa. Harry was the youngest child in his family of four; he had a sister named Lulu and twin brothers named George and Charlie. Hooper&#x27;s mother, Mary Katherine (Keller), was from Frankfurt, Germany.

Hooper&#x27;s two older brothers had been forced to quit school early to work on the family farm, but Hooper showed an affinity for school, especially in math. One of Hooper&#x27;s teachers helped to convince his parents to allow Hooper to attend a high school in Oakland. After graduating from the high school affiliated with Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California, Hooper graduated from college there with an engineering degree. At St. Mary&#x27;s Hooper had demonstrated his skills both academically and on the ball field.

==Baseball career==
===Minor leagues===
Hooper was a pitcher when he signed with the Oakland Commuters in 1907 to begin his minor league career, but he converted to a position player role. In 41 games with Oakland, he hit for a .301 batting average in 156 at bats. He spent the next year with the Sacramento Senators, hitting .344 in 77 games. His contract with Sacramento also provided him with work as a railroad surveyor when he was not playing baseball. Hooper did not know it at first, but his manager in Sacramento, Charles Graham, was a scout for the Boston Red Sox. Graham helped to arrange a meeting between Hooper and Red Sox owner John I. Taylor. Hooper was signed to a $2,800 contract with Boston.

===Boston Red Sox===
Breaking into the majors with the Red Sox in 1909, Hooper played in 81 games and hit .282. Between 1910 and 1915, he teamed with center fielder Tris Speaker and left fielder Duffy Lewis to form the Golden Outfield, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Religious differences may have been the biggest challenge for the Golden Outfield. At the time, a common Protestant sentiment was that Catholics would move to their communities and change the established culture. Speaker, who was a Protestant, once went a year without speaking to Hooper or Lewis, who were both Catholic.

Though Hooper was a hard competitor on the field, he became known for his likable personality and sense of humor, which contrasted with Speaker&#x27;s tough exterior. Hooper became a favorite with the fans and he established a reputation as a clutch player. He became known as a top-caliber defensive right fielder and a solid leadoff hitter. He invented a maneuver known as the &quot;rump-slide&quot; for catching shallow fly balls.

In 1910, Hooper played 155 games and hit .267 in a league-leading 688 plate appearances, marking the first of 11 consecutive seasons where he had at least 564 plate appearances. He led all AL outfielders with 30 assists that season, but he also committed a league-high 18 errors. In 130 games the next year, Hooper hit .311; the outfield trio of Hooper, Lewis, and Speaker hit .315 combined.

Hooper&#x27;s batting average dropped to .242 in 1912. Boston won the 1912 World Series, during which Hooper made a catch in the decisive 8th game that &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; referred to as one of the finest plays in baseball history. The catch robbed Larry Doyle of a home run in a game ultimately won by the Red Sox by a score of 3-2. The paper noted that Hooper &quot;does not seek the limelight. He is reserved and bashful, and every action of his upon the baseball field plainly shows these qualities.&quot; Red Sox pitcher Smokey Joe Wood described the catch as follows: 
On May 30, 1913, Hooper became the first player to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader, a mark only matched by Rickey Henderson, Brady Anderson, and Ronald Acuña Jr. over 80 years later. In 1914, he recorded 230 putouts in right field, which was the first of several seasons in which he finished in the top three in that category among right fielders.

On October 13, 1915, in Game 5 of the 1915 World Series, Hooper became the second player to hit two home runs in a single World Series game. Lewis contributed a third home run as the Red Sox won another world championship four games to one. Hooper was also the captain of the Red Sox in 1919. Hooper talked Boston manager Ed Barrow into converting Babe Ruth from a pitcher to an outfielder.

===Chicago White Sox===
Before the 1921 season, the media questioned whether Hooper would re-sign with the Red Sox for the coming season, saying that Hooper may have been disappointed not to be given an opportunity at manager. Since 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee had been getting rid of expensive veteran players in what has been called a &quot;fire-sale&quot;. The Red Sox traded Hooper to the Chicago White Sox in March 1921 in exchange for Shano Collins and Nemo Leibold. Newspaper accounts said that Hooper had not been warned about the trade, that he would demand a higher salary from the White Sox, and that he was prepared not to play unless the team met his demands.

Hooper had some of his best offensive production with the White Sox. He hit over .300 in three of the five seasons he spent with the team, and he hit a career-high 11 home runs and 80 runs batted in (RBIs) during the 1922 season. In 1922 and again in 1924, Hooper was involved in eight double plays, which led the league for outfielders in both of those seasons. In 1925, Hooper asked for his release from Chicago so that he could pursue a position as a manager.

Hooper was a career .281 hitter with 75 home runs, 817 RBI, 1429 runs, 2466 hits, 389 doubles, 160 triples, 375 stolen bases and 1136 bases on balls in 2309 games. Defensively, Hooper finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. He holds the Red Sox franchise records for most triples (130) and stolen bases (300), as well as Fenway Park records for triples (63) and stolen bases (107). Hooper is only one of two players (Heinie Wagner being the other) to be a part of four Red Sox World Series championships. He hit better than .300 five times in his career and compiled a .293 batting average (27-for-92) in four World Series appearances.

==Outside baseball==
Early in his baseball career, Hooper became involved in business interests that were unrelated to baseball. His original interest was peach orchards in Capitola, California. He later purchased additional orchards in Yuba City, and he also began to produce artichokes and pomegranates. Hooper received a military draft exemption as a farmer in 1917, but his land was mostly maintained by his father or by foremen that he hired. Given Hooper&#x27;s hands-off approach to his business dealings, he relied heavily on the advice of others. Over the years, he entered into several business opportunities that lost money, including investments in an insurance agency, in oil drilling, and in juice processing. However, he was successful enough with local property investments that he avoided financial strain.

Hooper married the former Esther Henchy in 1912 and they had three children, named John, Harry Jr, and Marie. His son John played minor league baseball under Lefty Gomez in Binghamton, New York.

==Later life==
Following his retirement from baseball, Hooper lived in Capitola and opened a real estate firm. He was named player-manager for San Francisco&#x27;s minor league team in the Pacific Coast League in 1927. Hooper coached the baseball team at Princeton University for two seasons in the 1930s. He elected to leave the university when, in a cost-cutting measure prompted by the Great Depression, the administration proposed that his $5,000 annual salary be reduced by 40 percent.

Hooper was appointed postmaster in Capitola in 1933. He held that position for 24 years. He was active in civic affairs through the chamber of commerce and the improvement club. &quot;He was one of Capitola&#x27;s most prominent local citizens. Whenever something was going on in Capitola from the 1920s to the 1960s, he was involved,&quot; local museum curator Frank Perry said.

In 1939, Hooper agreed to coach Boston&#x27;s professional indoor baseball league team. He remained active in later life, enjoying hunting, fishing and following the San Francisco Giants and the Red Sox.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, John Hooper spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to get his father inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame via the Veterans Committee. Hooper was selected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

Hooper died on December 18, 1974, at the age of 87 in Santa Cruz, California. He had been healthy enough to attend that summer&#x27;s Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies and he had gone duck hunting less than a month before he died. Hooper had surgery for a circulatory issue three weeks before his death, but he seemed to have recovered well from that procedure. Harry Hooper Jr said that Hooper had died of old age. He said that Hooper was the oldest living member of the Hall of Fame before his death.

==In popular culture==
Hooper Beach in Capitola is named for Harry Hooper. In 2014, the Capitola History Museum created an exhibit highlighting Hooper&#x27;s importance in the development of the city.

The television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; made a brief visual reference to Hooper in the 1992 episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, where Mr. Burns has selected Hooper to play center field for his company&#x27;s all-star softball team. His assistant Smithers has to point out that all the players Mr. Burns had selected are long since retired and dead.

<text>The Tongue River is a tributary of the Pembina River in northeastern North Dakota in the United States. It drains an area of the prairie country near the Canada–US border in the extreme northeast corner of the state in the watershed of the Red River.

It rises in eastern Cavalier County and flows in a direct course east-northeast into Pembina County, passing the towns of Cavalier, Neche and Bathgate. It joins the Pembina from the south approximately upstream from the mouth of the Pembina on the Red River.

Upstream of Cavalier, the river passes through Icelandic State Park, where Renwick Dam causes it to form Lake Renwick. Below the dam, foot trails follow the river in the Gunlogson Arboretum Nature Preserve.

<doc id="702771" wikidata="Q37498" url="?curid=702771" title="Alpine Dachsbracke">
<text>The Alpine Dachsbracke () is a small breed of dog of the scent hound type originating in Austria. The Alpine Dachsbracke was bred to track wounded deer as well as boar, hare, and fox. It is highly efficient at following a trail even after it has gone cold. The Alpine Dachsbracke is very sturdy.

==Description==

===Appearance===
This small dog has a slight resemblance to a Dachshund, with short legs (although longer than a dachshund&#x27;s) and a long body. The coat is dense, short but smooth except for the tail and neck. The round eyes have a lively expression. Being very sturdy, the Alpine Dachsbracke is visibly robust and has a big boned structure.

Preferred colors in competition are dark deer red with or without black hairs lightly interspersed. Black with red-brown markings on the head, chest, legs, feet, and tail are also permitted, as well as a white star on the chest (according to the American Rare Breed Association). The ideal height for dogs is 37–38 cm, and the ideal height for bitches is 36–37 cm. Strong limbs and feet, with black toenails and tight toes as well as strong elastic skin are features that judges look for in competition. They also look for a trotting gait. The top coat should be very thick, the undercoat dense and both closefitting to the body.

The Alpine Dachsbracke weighs from 15 to 18 kg (33 to 40 lb) and stands from 34 to 42 cm (13 to 16 in) at the withers. It is often compared with the dachshund, as they are very similar in appearance.

===Temperament===
Used effectively to track wounded deer, this breed could work even in harsh terrain and high altitude. It makes a good companion, although it is primarily a hunter and therefore is kept mostly by hunters. It has a fearless, friendly and intelligent personality. Most Alpine Dachsbrackes are excellent with children and good with dogs and other pets, though they may exhibit a strong prey drive typical of many scent dogs.

==History==
Alpine Dachsbrackes, as with the other Bracke, can be dated back to the middle of the 19th century. The Dachsbrache were bred down in size by crossing the larger dogs with Dachshunds. It once was a favorite of German royalty. During the 1880s, Alpine Dachsbrackes accompanied Crown Prince Rudolf of Habsburg on hunting trips to Egypt and Turkey.

The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognizes the Alpine Dachsbracke in Group 6 Scenthounds, Section 2 “Leash Hounds” with the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217) and the Hanoverian Scenthound (Hannover&#x27;scher Schweisshund, no. 213). The only major kennel club in the English-speaking world to recognise the Alpine Dachsbracke is the United Kennel Club (US) in their Scenthound Group, but they use the Fédération Cynologique Internationale breed standard. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses.

<text>The Antonov An-2 (USAF/DoD reporting name Type 22, NATO reporting name Colt) is a Soviet mass-produced single-engine biplane utility/agricultural aircraft designed and manufactured by the Antonov Design Bureau beginning in 1947. Its durability, lifting power, and ability to take off and land from poor runways have given it a long service life. The An-2 was produced up to 2001 and remains in service with military and civilian operators around the world.

The An-2 was designed as a utility aircraft for forestry and agriculture, but the basic airframe is adaptable and numerous variants have been developed. These include hopper-equipped crop-dusters, scientific versions for atmospheric sampling, water-bombers for fighting forest fires, air ambulances, seaplanes, and versions for dropping paratroopers.

The most common version is the An-2T 12-seater passenger aircraft. All versions (other than the An-3 and the An-2-100) are powered by a nine-cylinder Shvetsov ASh-62 radial engine. 

==Design and development==
===Origins===
The Antonov An-2 was designed to meet a 1940s Soviet Ministry of Forestry requirement to replace the smaller Polikarpov Po-2, which was used in large numbers in both agricultural and utility roles. Antonov designed a large single bay biplane of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit and a cabin with seats for twelve passengers. The first prototype, designated SKh-1, powered by a Shvetsov ASh-21 radial engine, flew on 31 August 1947. The second prototype was fitted with a more powerful Shvetsov ASh-62 engine, which allowed the aircraft&#x27;s payload to be increased from , and in this form saw production.
Initial production was at State Factory 473 in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, where the majority of up to 5,000 units had been produced by 1960. Later Soviet production (after 1965, of model An-2M especially) was at State Factory 464 at Dolgoprudniy, Russian SFSR. After 1960, most An-2s were constructed at Poland&#x27;s WSK factory in Mielec. It is believed that over 13,000 were built in Poland before manufacturing ended in 1991.

Until 2001, limited production was undertaken using remaining stocks of spares, including a small batch of four aircraft that were produced for Vietnam. China also builds the An-2 under licence as the Shijiazhuang Y-5. It has been erroneously reported that there was East German production of the An-2; while An-2s often underwent extensive refurbishment in East German facilities, no new aircraft were built there.

The An-2 is commonly used as a light utility transport, parachute drop aircraft, agricultural work and other tasks suited to a large slow biplane. Its slow flight and good short field performance make it suited for short, unimproved fields, and some specialized variants have also been built for cold weather and other extreme environments. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; states that the 45-year production run for the An-2 was for a time the longest for any aircraft and challenged the over two decade-long run of the 1920s Polikarpov Po-2 it replaced. The An-2&#x27;s record has since been exceeded.

===Further development===
During the early 1980s, Antonov experimented with an An-2 powered by a Glushenkov turboprop engine. Aircraft with this engine had a longer, streamlined nose. It received the designation An-3.

During 2013, Antonov announced that it had flown a new An-2 version, the &quot;An-2-100&quot;, with a three-blade reversible propeller and a Motor Sich MS-14 turboprop running on kerosene rather than Avgas, which is no longer produced in CIS countries. That same year, the company stated that it had received orders for upgrading hundreds in Azerbaijan, Cuba and Russia to the An-2-100 version.

The Siberian Research Institute of Aviation (SIBNIA) test flew a modified An-2 with winglets and a carbon fibre wing structure. It was equipped with a turboprop engine with a five bladed propeller. According to Russian aviation company Sukhoi, this aircraft was a demonstrator for an An-2 replacement announced on 10 June 2015. The carbonfibre composite materialsincluding wing panels, spars and ribs were produced by the Novosibirsk Aviation Plant. Sukhoi says the design change increased its speed by 50%.

==Design==


The An-2 is a mass-produced single-engine biplane that was deliberately furnished with a minimum of complex systems. The wing leading edge slats that give the aircraft its slow flight ability are fully automatic, being held shut by the airflow over the wings. When airspeed drops below , elastic rubber springs extend the slats. Under typical conditions, take-off can be made within while the landing run requires . These figures vary dependent on weight, air temperature, runway surface, and wind direction.

The An-2 is equipped with features which make it suitable for operation in remote areas with unimproved airstrips. It is fitted with a pneumatic brake system similar to those used on heavy trucks to stop on short runways, along with an air line attached to the compressor, so the pressure in the tires and shock absorbers can be adjusted. The batteries, while sizable, are easy to remove, and it does not need a ground power unit for starting the engine. Likewise, there is no need for an external fuel pump to refuel the aircraft as it is provided with its own.

The operating handbook does not explicitly specify a stall speed, stating instead: &quot;If the engine quits in instrument conditions or at night, the pilot should pull the control column full aft and keep the wings level. The leading-edge slats will snap out at about and when the airplane slows to a forward speed of about , the airplane will sink at about a parachute descent rate until the aircraft hits the ground.&quot;

The low stall speed makes it possible for the aircraft to fly backwards relative to the ground under high wind conditions while under control.

Many western countries prohibit the use of the An-2 commercially because the aircraft has not been certified by the relevant national aviation authorities. These restrictions vary by country, but all prevent the An-2 being used for any commercial purpose, with the exception of the United States, where PZL-built An-2s are exempt from this restriction due to a bilateral agreement with Poland. Other An-2s are operated non-commercially under an experimental certification.

==Operational history==
===Military service===
The An-2 was operated in large numbers by the Soviet Air Force and Eastern Bloc forces. Its first military use was during the Korean War of the early 1950s.

The Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) operated the An-2 during the Vietnam War and occasionally used the type as an attack aircraft. During the 1960s, a single An-2 that was engaging South Vietnamese naval units was shot down by a United States Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter.

On 12 January 1968, a clandestine TACAN site (call sign: &quot;Lima Site 85&quot;/Phou Pha Ti) installed by the United States Air Force in Northern Laos for directing USAF warplanes flying from Thailand to Vietnam was attacked by three North Vietnamese An-2s. A pair of An-2s fired on the outpost using a mixture of machine guns and rockets while a third An-2 orbited overhead.

An Air America Bell UH-1B resupplying the site gave chase to the attacking aircraft. Using an AK-47, the American crew (Ted Moore Captain, Glen Wood Kicker) succeeded in shooting down one of the An-2s while the second aircraft was forced down by combined ground and air fire, eventually crashing into a mountain. The surviving Antonov returned to its home base, Gia Lam, near Hanoi.

During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, a number of elderly An-2s previously used for crop-spraying were converted by the Croatian Air Force to drop makeshift barrel bombs. They were also used to conduct supply missions to besieged parts of Croatia.

The chief advantage of the An-2 was its ability to operate from small improvised airstrips. They frequently dropped supplies by parachute to isolated garrisons. At least one An-2 was shot down on 2 December 1991 over Vinkovci, eastern Slavonia, by a Serbian surface to air missile (SAM) with a salvo of SA-6s.

North Korea has also operated An-2s. The Korean People&#x27;s Army Special Operation Force has used the An-2 to infiltrate paratroopers. 

During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Azerbaijan operated unmanned An-2s for surveillance and bombing of Armenian defenses, however the type of the drone was unknown as of October 2020. Armenian forces revealed footage of the alleged shootdown of an Azerbaijani An-2, according to video evidence at least 11 An-2 have been destroyed, with 10 confirmed as shot down and one crashing after takeoff.

On March 2, 2022, Russian An-2s were observed at Seshcha Air Base, Bryansk Oblast. As the base is close to the Ukraine border, it was speculated that the aircraft were to be used in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Civil aviation ===

Over the years, dozens of nations and companies have employed the An-2 in civil roles. The type was heavily used throughout the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc nations. In particular, the Russian airline Aeroflot operated a large number of them. The An-2 was used as a short-range airliner, and in Estonia, made regular flights between the towns of Kuressaare and Kärdla, which are on separate islands, Saaremaa and Hiiumaa.

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, most airlines in these regions have been retiring their An-2s, as some were over 40 years old, as well as a result of the decline in the production of avgas to fuel the type. Private operators are still using An-2s, as they remain popular for some functions, such as for skydiving.

High noise levels, maintenance costs and fuel consumption has rendered them obsolete for the majority of commercial routes in Europe, but the large number available mean that unit prices are low in comparison to alternatives (as little as US$30,000 for a serviceable example). Price has made them attractive in the developing world, where their abilities makes them an asset to airlines on a budget. Many ex-Aeroflot An-2s have found work with regional operators across Africa, Central and South America, Cuba and southeast Asia.

As of 2015, there were thousands of An-2s in operation around the world, including over 1,500 in Russia, 294 in Kazakhstan and 54 in Ukraine.

In September 2024, Vladimir Putin ordered the UZGA LMS-901 Baikal aircraft into production as a replacement. However, certification of that aircraft&#x27;s Klimov VK-800SM engine is not expected until 2025, with engine deliveries not starting until 2026.

==Variants==


===Soviet / Polish production===
====Prototype====
* Izdeliye F – The in-house designation for the An-2NAK observation aircraft which was later re-designated An-2K and/or An-2F.
* Izdeliye K – A prototype weather reconnaissance/research aircraft with an observers cockpit immediately forward of the fin above the rear fuselage. First flown on 21 March 1948 &#x27;Izdeliye K&#x27; was found to be under-powered and unable to carry out its intended mission at high altitude, the aircraft was abandoned after a landing accident in October 1948. The concept was resurrected in 1954 as the &#x27;An-2ZA&#x27; / &#x27;An-6 Meteo&#x27;.
* Izdeliye T – The original design concept originated at OKB-153 in Novosibirsk.
* Izdeliye Sh – The in-house designation for the &#x27;Izdeliye T&#x27; (presumably to confuse spies or infiltrators) design project at Novosibirsk.
* SKh-1 – the original designation of the An-2 used during the design phase of the project before the OKB had been named after Antonov.
* An-2A – Developed from the An-2T for use as a Balloon interceptor to intercept reconnaissance balloons from, US intelligence assets, over-flying the USSR. The prototype was converted from a Kiev built An-2 (c/n 110347315) using the Turbo-charged Ash-62IR/TK of the &#x27;An-6 Meteo&#x27; and a combined searchlight/gun turret mounted on top of the rear fuselage, which mounted either a single Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 23 mm calibre twin-barrelled cannon or a single Afanas&#x27;yev A-12.7 12.7 mm calibre heavy machine-gun.
* An-2E (&quot;Ekranoplan&quot; – wing in ground effect) (first use of the designation) – One of a series of projects from the early 1970s for WIG (Wing In Ground effect) derivatives of the An-2, designed at the TsLST (&quot;Tsentral&#x27;naya Laboratoriya Spasatel&#x27;noy Techniki&quot; – central laboratory for new types of rescue equipment).
* An-2E (second use of the designation) – An Ekranoplan conversion () of an An-2P (RA-84692). The fuselage was retained and a large trapezoidal monoplane wing having extended wingtips with approx 45° dihedral, attached to the lower wing attachment points. The prototype conversion was intended to be a floatplane; however, its first public appearance was as a landplane with the standard An-2 undercarriage. Jointly developed by the Moscow Aviation Institute, MARZ (&quot;Moskovskiy Aviaremontnyy Zavod&quot; – Moscow Aircraft Overhaul Plant) and The TSZP-Saturn research institute the An-2E was also known as EA-00078. Power was supplied by the standard ASh-62IR radial engine with AV-2 propeller, but production versions were intended to be powered by automotive diesel engines of around .
* An-2F – Developed concurrently with the An-2 prototype, &#x27;Izdeliye F&#x27; was an experimental artillery-observation aircraft with a twin-tail, ventral observer&#x27;s position and dorsal defensive machine-gun position. The initial service designation of An-2NAK was changed to An-2F once post test flight modifications had been carried out. Two prototypes were built, with the first completed in the summer of 1948, but flight testing was delayed to April 1949 due to the need to incorporate modifications called up from the standard An-2 flight test programme. The flight test of the An-2F showed that the aircraft met all the requirements of the specification, but helicopters were demonstrating that they could perform the artillery correction role without the need to provide fixed base airstrip for them to operate from, thus the An-2F was not proceeded with and the two prototypes were retained by the Antonov bureau for hack duties with one later serving as a flying wind tunnel to investigate para-dropping from the Antonov An-8 twin-turboprop transport.
* An-2F (second use of designation) – A VTOL project with vertical thrust to be provided by a Mikulin AM-9 turbojet in the rear fuselage.
* An-2F (third use of the designation) – A proposed photo-mapping aircraft project, from the early 1990s, similar to the An-2PF equipped with one of five alternate cameras. Overall control was to have been by IBM 286 computer and the camera could be augmented or replaced by a thermal imaging system, Infra-Red imaging system, AP-6E autopilot, LDI-3 laser rangefinder and/or a GPS global positioning system.
* An-2G (a.k.a. An-2Geo) – During 1974 WSK-Mielec developed a geo-physical survey aircraft for the Polish State Geophysical Survey Agency (&quot;Państwowe Przedsiębiorstwo Poszukiwań Geofizycznych&quot;), with equipment for measuring magnetic fields, radiation and other instruments for prospecting. Adapted to fly in tropical latitudes at low altitude the &#x27;An-2G&#x27; could fly for six hours and two were used for survey work in Nigeria in 1974.
* An-2LP (&quot;Lesopozharnyy&quot; – forest firefighter) – A single prototype converted from an An-2V floatplane, with 630 litre(139 Imp.Gal.) water tanks in each float for dropping on fires. The water tanks could be re-filled in flight, as the aircraft skimmed the surface of suitable bodies of water. Prior to dropping an alkaline wetting agent (NP-1 Sulphanol) was added to the water which was released through the scoops which also picked up the water to refill the tanks. Ten production aircraft were built seeing service in the Siberian and Far East regions of the USSR.
====An-2====
* An-2L (&quot;Lesozashchita&quot; – forestry protection) – A fire bomber variant with three cassettes each holding 120 ampoules, containing 1litre (34 fl.oz.) of fire-retardant which were dropped as required. Trials revealed that this system was inefficient and further work was abandoned.
* An-2LL (&quot;Letayuschaya Laboratoriya&quot; – flying laboratory) – Any of a number of An-2s used as testbeds for various equipment. One An-2SKh (RA-70547), modified by the State Research Institute of Aircraft Systems. (GosNII AS – &quot;Gosudarstvennyy Nauchno-Issledovatel&#x27;skiy Institut Aviatsionnykh Sistem&quot;), for environmental research, had a lateral observation blister which has often caused the aircraft to be misidentified as an An-2PF.
* An-2LV (&quot;Lesnoj Vodnyj&quot; – forest hydroplane) – A firefighting waterbomber.
* An-2M (Polish:&quot;[samolot] Morski&quot; – seaplane) – Polish production of the An-2V floatplane, designated An-2M, (not to be confused with the Soviet designation An-2M). Also known as the An-2W.
* An-2M (&quot;Modifitsirovannyy&quot; – modified) – The designation An-2M was also used in the USSR for a much improved agricultural crop-sprayer/duster. The An-2M featured an all-duralumin welded and bonded fuselage, lockable tailwheel, enlarged fibre-glass hopper, Shvetsov ASh-62 radial engine with power take off to an auxiliary gearbox to drive the dusting/spraying equipment, an angular fin of increased area and a hermetically sealed cockpit with no access to the cabin/hopper area. The hopper capacity was increased 42% to 2,000 litres (440 Imp.gal.) delivering product through an outlet enlarged to with dry product being fed to two dusting outlets at the tips of the lower wings. Due to lack of capacity at the Kiev factory and WSK-Mielec the An-2M was manufactured at DMZ N0.464 (&quot;Dolgoproodnyy Machinery Factory No.464&quot;) to the north of Moscow.
* An-2P (Polish: &quot;Pasażerski&quot; – passenger) (Russian: &quot;Passazhirskiy&quot; – passenger) – Soviet and Polish production of a standard passenger variant. Soviet production An-2P&#x27;s had 10 permanently installed seats in a heated insulated cabin. Polish production aircraft had 12–14 seats, two jump seats for children and a baby cot. A total of 837 An-2P&#x27;s were built.
* An-2P (&quot;Protivopozharnij&quot; – fire-fighting with water) – A fire-fighting aircraft with a dumpable hopper filled with water and/or retardant.
* An-2PD-5 (Polish: &quot;Pasażerski [samolot] Dyspozycyjny&quot; – executive aircraft&#x27;s) – The production version of the &#x27;An-2PD-6&#x27;, featuring almost identical interior furnishings with a work table and reading light replacing one of the chairs.
* An-2PD-6 (Polish: &quot;Pasażerski [samolot] Dyspozycyjny&quot; – executive aircraft&#x27;s) – A prototype six seat VIP variant of the An-2P produced at WSK-Mielec in 1970, featuring a folding table, mini-bar, pantry and toilet.
* An-2PF – Soviet production An-2 aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera hatches protected by sliding hatches on the undersurface of the fuselage.
* An-2PF – A joint request from the Polish State mapping Agency (&quot;Państwowe Przedsiębiorstwo Kartografii&quot;) led to Polish production of eight &#x27;An-2PF&#x27; aircraft configured for photo-mapping/survey tasks with camera hatches protected by sliding hatches on the undersurface of the fuselage.
* An-2PK – A polar research aircraft developed by WSK-Mielec with heated skis, insulated cabin and an additional cabin heater.
* An-2PRTV – A single Polish production An-2, (SP-TVN, c/n1G 15944), modified as a television broadcast relay aircraft for the Polish Radio and Television Co. (&quot;Polskie Radio i Telewizja&quot;).
* An-2R (Polish: &quot;Rolniczy&quot; – agricultural) – WSK-Mielec manufactured agricultural variant with tank for of liquid or powdered chemicals.
* An-2RA – A projected up-graded Agricultural aircraft, based on the An-2R, developed at WSK-Mielec.
* An-2RT (Russian: &quot;Rele Translyator&quot; – relay translator) – A single An-2 was converted to a telemetry relay station, for missile development work, relaying telemetry from test missiles to a ground station.
* An-2S (&quot;Sanitarnyy&quot; – medical) – The An-2S was an adaptation of the standard An-2T cargo plane with up to six stretcher patients or three stretchers and six walking wounded along with attendants and support equipment.
* An-2SKh (&quot;Sel&#x27;skoKhozyaistvennyy&quot; – agricultural) – The agricultural version optimised for crop-spraying and crop-dusting. A metal construction chemical hopper was installed in the cabin near the centre of gravity, feeding a spreader through a 300mm orifice. The original spreader was replaced in 1975 by a standardised RTSh-1 three channel spreader which increased distribution width from to . Liquid chemicals could be sprayed using an interchangeable system which delivered chemical to spraybars via a ram air turbine driven regulator pump to give coverage wide. Powdered or granulated chemicals were loaded through a hatch in the roof of the cabin and liquid chemical through a special connector on the port side of the fuselage. Early An-2SKh&#x27;s were typically limited to a 6,000-hour life, as opposed to a normal life of 12,000 hours, due to the corrosive effects of the chemicals. The introduction of epoxy based corrosion protection systems partly alleviated the situation, allowing the agricultural An-2s to continue flying for much longer. Five An-2SKh aircraft were converted to firefighters, from 1954, by pressurising the hopper filled with water and/or retardant and ejecting it from a nozzle in place of the dusting/spraying equipment, single aircraft were allocated to Civil Air Directorates across the country but proved relatively ineffectual.
* An-2T (&quot;Transportnyy&quot; – cargo) – The baseline first production model for cargo and mail carriage.
* An-2TD (&quot;Transportno-Desantnyy&quot; – cargo/paratrooper) – paratrooper version with 12 seats, static line attachment cables and drop signalling lights.
* An-2TP (&quot;Transportno-Passazhirskiy&quot; – cargo/passenger) – A convertible passenger/cargo version, with tip-up seats for ten, released in 1949.
* An-2TPS (&quot;Transportno-Passazhirskiy Sanitarnyy&quot; – cargo/passenger medical) – Polish production of ambulance aircraft derived from An-2TP aircraft with three stretchers each side and two medical attendants.
* An-2V (&quot;Vodnyy&quot; – water-based) – A seaplane version of the baseline An-2 fitted with twin floats supported on wire-braced struts at the undercarriage attachment points and rear fuselage. Floatplane An-2s manufactured in Kiev were designated An-4 but there is little evidence that this designation was widely used. At least one An-2V. AN-2V Video
* An-2V (&quot;Vysotnyy&quot; – high altitude) – Six aircraft were built, at the Kiev factory, as weather reconnaissance An-2V&#x27;s for use at high altitude. Powered by the ASh-62IR/TK turbo-charged engine, they differed from the &#x27;An-6 Meteo&#x27; by not having the observers cockpit forward of the fin.
* An-2VA – water bomber.
* An-2W (&quot;Wodnosamolot&quot; – seaplane) – Polish production of the An-2V, also sometimes designated An-2M (not to be confused with the improved variant).
* An-2ZA (&quot;Zondirovaniye Atmosfery&quot; – atmosphere sampling) – The initial designation for a high altitude meteorological research re-designated as the &#x27;An-6 Meteo&#x27;.
* An-3 (first use of the designation) – A radical redesign of the An-2A to intercept reconnaissance balloons from US intelligence assets, over-flying the USSR. With a high aspect ratio monoplane high-set wing, turbo-charged ASh-62IR/TK and a combined searchlight/gun turret mounted on top of the rear fuselage.
====An-3====
* An-3 (second use of designation) – In an effort to replace the An-2SKh, after the poor performance of the abortive WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor, it was proposed to fit a turboprop engine on an all new fuselage featuring a hunchback for the cockpit and An-2M tail surfaces. This design was not carried through and a less ambitious re-design resulted in the third and final use of the An-3 designation.
* An-3 (third use of designation) – The prototype An-3 with a Glushenkov TVD-20 turboprop engine, sealed cockpit with separate entrance door above lower wing leading edge and air conditioning to improve the cockpit environment. Two prototypes were built (CCCP-06131 and CCCP37901) with a third registration (CCCP26700) which is believed to be a re-registration of one of the other two registrations. The flight tests and trials progressed well and the two prototypes set no less than six World Records for payload to altitude in their class. Due to the collapse of the USSR initial plans for production and variants were shelved until 1993 when production of converted aircraft began, as the An-3T, at the Omsk &#x27;Polyot&#x27; factory.
** An-3T – Due to the large number of surplus An-2s available the An-3T was not produced from scratch but by converting aircraft which had at least 50% of their life remaining. All the aircraft were re-registered and given new construction numbers.
** An-3TK – A convertible passenger /cargo version with six foldable twin seats.
** An-3SKh – An agricultural version tested with one of the original prototypes but with no known production conversions.
** An-3P – A forest fire fighting water bomber with a tank installed in the fuselage.
** An-3S – A projected ambulance version with six stretchers and two medical attendants.
** An-3D – Projected military troopship version with tip-up seats for paratroopers.
====An-4====
* An-4 – This designation was used for An-2V seaplanes produced at Kiev, but does not seem to be used much. This is either due to very limited production at Kiev or operators not making the distinction between the An-2V and An-4.
====An-6====
* An-6 – A transport aircraft fitted with the Shvetsov Ash-62IR/TK turbo-charged engine was produced for use in mountainous areas at high altitudes. An unknown number were delivered to the Tajik Civil Aviation Directorate and the Polar directorate for use in the far north of the USSR and to support the USSR&#x27;s Antarctic research stations.
*An-6 Meteo – After the failure of &#x27;Izdeliye K&#x27;, the Antonov bureau was tasked with developing the &#x27;An-2ZA&#x27; high-altitude weather reconnaissance aircraft based on the An-2. Featuring the same observers cockpit, forward of the vertical stabiliser above the rear fuselage, used on &#x27;Izdeliye K&#x27;, power was supplied by a turbo-charged Shvetsov Ash-62IR/TK which enabled the &#x27;An-2ZA&#x27; to carry out its intended high-altitude research role. On 9 June 1954 OKB-153 test pilot V.A. Kalinin and Flight Engineer V.I. Baklaykin set a World altitude record for Class C-1e-1 () at which had not been broken by 2004. The &#x27;An-2ZA&#x27; was re-designated &#x27;An-6 Meteo&#x27; early in its career and continued to fly until a take-off accident in September 1958 caused extensive damage.
====others====
* Grach-2 (&quot;Grach&quot;-Rook) – Students from the SKB MAI (&quot;Studencheskoye Konstruktorskoye Byuro Moskovskii Aviatsionii Institut [Sergo Ordjonikidze]&quot; – student construction bureau Moscow Aviation Institute [Sergo Ordjonikidze]) studied agricultural aircraft utilising the WIG effect. Their first effort, named &quot;Grach&quot;-2, was a standard An-2 fuselage mated to low-set inverted gull. reverse-delta monoplane wings with couter, constant chord, dihedral sections and fitted with a t-tail.
* Grach-3 – The second projected WIG agricultural aircraft from the SKB MAI was the Grach-3. This aircraft was to have been similar to the Grach-2 but utilising a centre section with near constant chord which allowed the tailplane to be dispensed with and pitch controlled by elevators at the rear of the centre section.
* Lala-1 – A research prototype with an open-frame rear fuselage, twin tail and twin tailwheels supported by struts under the rear of the fuselage pod. An Ivchenko AI-25 turbofan engine was fitted in the rear of the fuselage pod for use as a development model for the WSK-Mielec M-15 Belphegor agricultural aircraft.
* SibNIA TVS-2MS – Turboprop conversion of An-2 by Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute (SibNIA) using Honeywell TPE331-12UHR engine. First flown 5 September 2011. Deliveries to the Aerial Forest Protection Service began in 2014, with six flying by August 2014 and 16 in service by early 2017.

* SibNIA TVS-2-DT – Fitted with new composite wings (with no bracing struts or wires) and tail. First flight 10 June 2015.
* SibNIA TVS-2-DTS – TVS-2-DT fitted with new all-composite fuselage. Production planned at Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant from 2019 to meet a requirement for at least 200 aircraft to be delivered from 2021 to 2025.

==Accidents and incidents==
As of 8 January 2023 there have been 802 An-2 hull-loss accidents, claiming a total of 825 lives. One of the most recent accidents occurred around 13:30 on 14 November 2022 in the Everglades, when an An-2, which had been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection was being transported to Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport and overturned during a forced landing caused by an engine failure. Both pilots survived.

The first known post-WWII act of suicide by pilot was with an An-2. Timofei Shovkunov stole an An-2 and flew it directly into his apartment building in Voroshilovgrad (now Luhansk) on March 27, 1972, apparently despondent after his wife having left along with his son the day before. He was the lone casualty.

In the third known post-WWII act of suicide by pilot, on September 26, 1976, Russian national Vladimir Serkov made an unauthorized takeoff with an An-2 (Reg # USSR-79868) from Novosibirsk-Severny Airport. He crashed it into the stairwell of an apartment complex at Stepnaya st., house 43 / 1, where his ex-wife&#x27;s parents lived, in an attempt to kill his ex-wife. After completing two laps around the scene, Serkov attempted to pilot the plane to the parents&#x27; apartment where his wife and two-year-old son were visiting. The aircraft pierced the stairwell between the 3rd and 4th floors, and being fueled with 800 liters of gasoline, ignited a large fire inside the stairwell that ultimately spread to damage 30 total apartments. Firefighters were on scene in five minutes, taking 57 minutes to extinguish the blaze. A four-year-old and two six-year-old children were killed at the scene from burns. Another four-year-old child died eight days later as a result of burns. In total, 11 residents were injured as a result of fire burns. Serkov&#x27;s ex-wife (and her parents) and his toddler son were not injured in the incident.

<text>CountryLink was a passenger rail and road service brand that operated in regional areas of New South Wales, and to and from Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne. Originally created as a business unit (or sub-brand) of the State Rail Authority of New South Wales, it later became a subsidiary of RailCorp. CountryLink operated rail services using XPT and Xplorer rolling stock, with connecting coach services operated under contract by private operators.

Its services were taken over by NSW TrainLink.

==History==

CountryLink was established in January 1989 under the Transport Administration Act 1988 as a business unit of what was then the State Rail Authority to operate all non-metropolitan long distance passenger services. It inherited a fleet of XPT and locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Following the election of the Greiner State Government in March 1988, consultants Booz Allen Hamilton were commissioned to prepare a report into NSW rail services. On purely economic grounds, the report recommended closing all country passenger services as they were judged unviable, however this was not politically acceptable. If services were to be maintained, the report recommended an &#x27;all XPT&#x27; option with an expanded network of coach services replacing many other services.

In November 1989, the &quot;Silver City Comet&quot; was withdrawn, while in February 1990 the &quot;Brisbane Limited&quot; and &quot;Pacific Coast Motorail&quot; were withdrawn and replaced by XPT services, the &quot;Canberra XPT&quot; was withdrawn and replaced by locomotive-hauled stock and the &quot;Northern Tablelands Express&quot; was truncated to Tamworth with road coaches introduced from Sydney to Armidale. The &quot;Intercapital Daylight&quot; ceased in August 1991 and the &quot;Sydney/Melbourne Express&quot; in November 1993 was replaced by an XPT in November 1993 following the delivery of additional stock.

In a June 1990 policy reversal, the government announced that it would purchase 17 Xplorer carriages to reintroduce services to Armidale and Moree and replace locomotive-hauled stock and coaches on services to Canberra. This would release an XPT to operate a daily service to operate the &quot;Grafton Express&quot; replacing a weekly locomotive-hauled service that was reintroduced at the same time. The Xplorers entered service on the North Western service in October 1993 and on the Canberra service in December 1993. In November 1994 the government ordered a further four Xplorer carriages.

In October 1990, the government announced that eight sleeper carriages would be ordered for use on overnight services to Brisbane, Murwillumbah and Melbourne. These were included in an order placed with ABB, Dandenong in 1991 for four power cars and 13 trailers that was jointly funded by the New South Wales and Victorian Governments.

In December 1994, a daylight service to Melbourne resumed by extending the &quot;Riverina XPT&quot; from Albury.

In 1995, CountryLink trialled three Swedish Railways X2000 tilting train carriages. After conducting a statewide tour in March, they were used on Canberra services from April until June with two modified XPT power cars.

In March 1996, services were reintroduced to Broken Hill and Griffith using refurbished locomotive-hauled rolling stock honouring an election commitment by the Carr State Government. Following the electrification of the Illawarra line from Dapto to Kiama, CityRail was able to release one of its mechanically identical Endeavours and this was converted to an Xplorer to replace the locomotive-hauled stock.

With the formation of RailCorp, responsibility for CountryLink transferred to the new corporation in January 2004. With the closure of the Muwillumbah branch, services were cut back to Casino from May 2004.

CountryLink was merged with the intercity services of CityRail to form NSW TrainLink on 1 July 2013.

===Patronage===
The following table lists patronage figures for the network during the corresponding financial year. Australia&#x27;s financial years start on 1 July and end on 30 June.
==Network==

CountryLink operated its own rolling stock over track managed by RailCorp in Sydney and the Australian Rail Track Corporation and Rail Infrastructure Corporation outside of Sydney. The hub of its operation was Sydney Central railway station.

===North Coast===
The North Coast region covers the North Coast, Northern Rivers and South East Queensland regions. Accordingly, the Government of Queensland made a contribution to the provision of these services. North Coast region services appeared on the network map in red. Services ran along the Main North and North Coast lines from Sydney Central station to Roma Street station in Brisbane.

Principal stations served by XPT trains were:
*Taree
*Kempsey
*Coffs Harbour
*Grafton
*Casino
*Brisbane

Cities and towns served by CountryLink coaches connecting off North Coast services included: Tea Gardens, Forster, Port Macquarie, Yamba, Moree, Lismore, Alstonville, Ballina, Byron Bay, Murwillumbah, Tweed Heads and Surfers Paradise.

===North Western===
The North Western region covers the state&#x27;s Hunter, Northern Tablelands and North West regions. North Western region services appeared on the network map in orange. Services ran along the Main North line from Sydney Central station to Werris Creek where the service divided for Armidale and Moree.

Principal stations served by Xplorer trains were:
*Singleton
*Scone
*Tamworth
*Armidale
*Gunnedah
*Narrabri
*Moree

Cities and towns served by CountryLink coaches connecting off North Western services included: Wee Waa, Inverell, Grafton, Glen Innes and Tenterfield.

===Western===
The Western region covers the Central Tablelands and Western regions. Western region services appeared on the network map in yellow. 
Services ran along the Main Western Line from Sydney Central station to Dubbo and the Broken Hill line to Broken Hill.

Principal stations served by XPT trains were:
*Bathurst
*Orange
*Dubbo

Principal stations served by Xplorer trains were:
*Bathurst
*Orange
*Parkes
*Broken Hill

Cities and towns served by CountryLink coaches connecting off Southern services included: Oberon, Mudgee, Baradine, Cowra, Grenfell, Forbes, Parkes, Condobolin, Lightning Ridge Brewarrina, Bourke, Warren and Broken Hill.

===Southern===

The Southern region covers the state&#x27;s Illawarra, South Coast, Snowy Mountains, South West Slopes, Southern Tablelands, Riverina and Sunraysia regions plus the Australian Capital Territory and parts of Victoria. Accordingly, the Government of Victoria (though not the ACT Government) made a contribution to the provision of these services. Southern region services appeared on the network map in green. Services ran along the Main South line from Sydney Central station to Albury before continuing on the North East line to Southern Cross station in Melbourne, with the line to Canberra branching off south of Goulburn and the line to Griffith at Junee.

Principal stations served by XPT trains were:
*Goulburn
*Cootamundra
*Wagga Wagga
*Albury
*Wangaratta
*Melbourne

Principal stations served by Xplorer trains were:
*Goulburn
*Queanbeyan
*Canberra
*Cootamundra
*Griffith

Cities and towns served by CountryLink coaches connecting off Southern services included: Wollongong, Bombala, Eden, Tumbarumba, Bathurst, Dubbo, Condobolin, Griffith, Mildura and Echuca.

==Rolling stock==
The final CountryLink fleet consisted of two train types, XPT (19 power cars and 60 carriages) and Xplorers (23 carriages). The XPT fleet was maintained at the purpose built XPT Service Centre. The Xplorer fleet was maintained at the Xplorer-Endeavour Service Centre.
==Road coaches==
The Public Transport Commission had first introduced coaches in September 1975 when six Dennings were introduced to replace all train services out of Dubbo. Coaches replaced many branch line rail services over the next few years and by 1987 the State Rail Authority had 36 Denning, Hino and Scania coaches operating throughout the state.

CountryLink adopted the model used by V/Line in Victoria and contracted out the provision of these services to private operators, with services transferring to the successful bidders between November 1989 and June 1990.

Coaches were originally painted in CountryLink&#x27;s grey, white and blue livery. Following the transfer of the administration of coach services to the Department of Transport in July 1992, operators were not required to repaint coaches dedicated to CountryLink duties, thus most operated in the livery of their owners. This policy was later reversed and coaches once again were painted in CountryLink livery.

The full list of coach operators providing services at the time CountryLink ceased in June 2013 were:
==Parry Report 2005==

===Ministerial Inquiry===
On 9 December 2003, the Minister for Transport Services released Professor Tom Parry&#x27;s Final Report of the Ministerial Inquiry into Sustainable Transport. Known as the &quot;Parry Report&quot; it recommended refocusing CountryLink, and to adjust fare structures.

&quot;CountryLink currently operates a number of train services that move relatively small numbers of passengers,&quot; the inquiry has concluded, noting that the high cost of maintenance and the need to replace rolling stock &quot;makes these services very expensive ... they are expected to become even more expensive in the future.&quot; At the time of the report operating expenditure is around five times as much as revenue gained through ticket sales.

The Inquiry also noted that in the year ended June 2003, CountryLink incurred $29.9 million in costs associated with advertising, booking and selling tickets, against $43.5 million in fare revenue. &quot;This is more than two-thirds of the revenue received from passengers and is excessive,&quot; the Inquiry report stated.

The Inquiry made eight specific recommendations for &quot;refocusing CountryLink&quot;:
*review the allocation of costs to CountryLink to improve the transparency of government railway accounts
*seek efficiencies in the marketing of tickets
*align subsidies to CountryLink with the benefits to the community
*seek to have the ACT Government contribute to the cost of the Sydney-Canberra service
*explore alternatives to rail on a case-by-case basis for all rural and regional routes
*include CountryLink in integrated regional transport planning
*establish &quot;Solutions Teams&quot; to assess various areas of CountryLink&#x27;s operations
*review fare structures and discounting

===Government response===
In 2005 the State Government announced a rationalisation of ticket offices across the CountryLink network, but ruled out the closure of further rail services in the immediate future. Ticket prices increased on 1 November.

Transport minister John Watkins told the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that &quot;To protect commuters who want a continued rail option, the Government has made a number of changes to booking options in an effort to secure CountryLink&#x27;s future and boost patronage.&quot; Mr Watkins also said in front of news crew that the refurbishment of the XPTs would also encourage more people to use the trains. However the Opposition questioned how price increases would increase patronage.

==Restructure==
In May 2012, the newly elected O&#x27;Farrell State Government announced RailCorp would be restructured, with CountryLink and the regional services of CityRail incorporated into NSW TrainLink in July 2013.

==Publication==
CountryLink published an in-house journal, &quot;Freight Rail &amp; Countrylink Xpress&quot;, in conjunction with Freight Rail.

<text>The Pembina River is a tributary of the Red River of the North, approximately long, in southern Manitoba in Canada and northeastern North Dakota in the United States. It drains an area (about 8500 square kilometers) of the prairie country along the Canada–US border, threading the Manitoba-North Dakota border eastward to the Red River. Via the Red River, Lake Winnipeg and the Nelson River, it is part of the watershed of Hudson Bay.

It rises in several streams on the eastern side of the Turtle Mountains on both sides of the international border. The streams converge near Neelin, Manitoba and flow initially northeast, then southeast along the west side of the Pembina Hills into Cavalier County in northeastern North Dakota. It flows east, just south of the border, past Walhalla and Neche. It joins the Red River from the west just south of Pembina, approximately south of the international border. It receives the Tongue River from the south approximately upstream from its mouth on the Red.

The main tributaries of the Pembina River are Badger Creek and Long River. Some of the numerous minor tributaries include the Mary Jane, Pilot, Crystal, and Snowflake Creeks. The Pembina River ranges in depth from at mid-channel. The full width of the river is highly variable, ranging from to as much as in other areas. There are numerous wetlands and prairie potholes in this watershed.

The elevation of the watershed ranges from above sea level in the southwestern corner of the watershed, down to adjacent to the Pembina River in the southeastern corner of the watershed. The watershed is level through the central and eastern regions, however the elevation rises roughly in the radius around the Turtle Mountain Provincial Park.

Water flow rates in the Pembina River watershed are highly variable. Data from hydrometric stations are used to monitor river flow rates and lake levels, for flood forecasting, and water management investigations. Water levels typically peak during spring run-off and rapidly declines generally in a few days. Groundwater contribution to stream flow normally ensures the river runs throughout the year. The months of March, April and May account for 68 percent of the run-off in a given year. Annual spring run-off rates are highly variable. In Neche, ND the lowest annual volume recorded was 356-m (2870 acre-ft) in 1939. The highest recorded volume was 94,400 hectare-m (765,000 acre-ft) in 1997.
Environment Canada has a water quality monitoring station is maintained at the south-east corner of the watershed, near the International Boundary. Information from this station is collected regularly and is used to analyze for numerous variables including pesticides, metals, nutrients, general chemistry, and bacteria. A study conducted in 2001 found that over a 25-year period (1974–99) phosphorus concentrations had increased by 52 percent in the Pembina river. This increase in phosphorus is likely a result of increased nutrient input from a combination of wastewater treatment, agricultural inputs, and atmospheric depositions. Elevated phosphorus concentrations promote excessive algal bloom growth, which have many undesirable outcomes for the watershed and the entire Lake Winnipeg basin.

<doc id="702793" wikidata="Q12069132" url="?curid=702793" title="Roger L. Simon">
<text>Roger Lichtenberg Simon (born November 22, 1943) is an American novelist and screenwriter. He was formerly CEO of PJ Media (formerly known as Pajamas Media) and is now its CEO Emeritus. He is the author of eleven novels, including the Moses Wine detective series, seven produced screenplays and two non-fiction books. He has served as president of the West Coast branch of PEN, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Writers Guild of America; he was also on the faculty of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute.

He has contributed to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, RealClearPolitics, and &quot;City Journal&quot;, among others. Simon has also been a Hoover Institution Media Fellow.

Simon&#x27;s most recent work, &quot;The GOAT&quot;, was published in 2019. It was described as his &quot;best novel&quot; by &quot;The New Criterion&quot;.

As of December 1, 2019, Simon has moved his journalism exclusively to &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; as their Editor-at-Large.

== PJ Media ==

Simon served as CEO of PJ Media until 2013 and is currently its CEO Emeritus. PJ Media is a media company and operator of an eponymous conservative opinion and commentary website. Founded in 2004 by a network primarily, but not exclusively, made up of conservatives and libertarians led by Simon, it was originally intended as a forum &quot;with the intention of... aggregating blogs to increase corporate advertising and creating our own professional news service&quot; but later included an online television service, PJTV, as well. PJ Media&#x27;s name, formerly Pajamas Media, is derived from a dismissive comment made by former news executive vice-president Jonathan Klein of CBS during the Killian documents affair involving then-CBS anchorman Dan Rather in the fall of 2004: &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of checks and balances at &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas&quot;. PJ Media was sold to Salem Communications in March 2019. Simon continues his affiliation with the company as co-founder and CEO Emeritus.

== Books ==

=== &quot;Moses Wine&quot; series ===

==== &quot;The Big Fix&quot; ====

Roger L. Simon began to develop the idea for Moses Wine when Alan Rinzler, who was working as an editor at Straight Arrow Books, a venture by Rolling Stone, suggested that a book Simon had written about a veteran of the Bay of Pigs Invasion who goes crazy and kidnaps the son of a radical lawyer, had poor commercial prospects. Rinzler suggested that Simon do something &quot;more Rolling Stone&quot;.

In response, Simon, who had recently been exploring the works of Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald came up with the idea of updating the private-eye genre with a &quot;hip, political, and edgy longhair&quot;. Six weeks later, Simon had finished the first Moses Wine novel, &quot;The Big Fix&quot;. At the time, Simon was living in Echo Park, California, where many of the stories in the Moses Wine series take place. Moses Wine was different from other fictional detectives that Simon saw as devoid of ethnicity, family, friends, or interests outside of work. In Moses Wine, Simon created a character that was proudly Jewish, divorced, and given to smoking marijuana. The cases taken on by Moses Wine were also unconventional. &quot;The Big Fix&quot; focused on the case of an Abbie Hoffman-like radical prankster who attempts to derail the presidential candidacy of a liberal democrat. &quot;The Big Fix&quot; won several awards and became a best-seller. It was later turned into a popular movie starring Richard Dreyfuss in 1978 for which Simon wrote the screenplay.

==== &quot;Raising the Dead&quot; ====
In &quot;Raising the Dead&quot;, Wine is retained by an Arab organization to prove that it had nothing to do with a terrorist attack. Most of the story takes place in Israel and Los Angeles, where a young member of a militant Jewish group has gone underground.

Responding to speculation that he had uncovered information related to the killing of Alex Odeh, a regional director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination League who had spoken out regarding the takeover of an Italian cruise-ship by Palestinians, Simon said that while he had visited Israel twice and talked to Jews and Arabs in the West Bank, he had not made any inquiries about the case. Simon said, &quot;This is not fact, this is fiction. If I had accidentally uncovered any information, I would have gone right to the FBI. It&#x27;s a capital case.&quot;

==== &quot;California Roll&quot; ====

At the start of &quot;California Roll&quot;, Wine is feeling his age and recovering from a mid-life crisis when he is invited to Silicon Valley by Alex Wiznitsky, a young genius known as the Wiz, who wants him to become head of security for Tulip, a computer company that rose from backstreet obscurity into the Fortune 500 in only three years. Soon after, one of the Wiz&#x27;s collaborators, another genius known as the Last Nerd, has disappeared. Wine eventually follows the case to Japan where roughly half the story takes place.

==== &quot;The Straight Man&quot; ====
In &quot;The Straight Man&quot; Wine has quit his posh job in corporate security and is back in West Los Angeles where he is half-heartedly doing private detective work from his apartment while trying to cure his mental angst with regular visits to a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist, himself disabled and using a wheelchair, asks Wine to investigate a possible murder. The dead man, Mike Ptak, was the husband of a patient being treated by the psychiatrist.

==== &quot;Moses Wine&quot; as autobiography ====
Simon says that the books are partially autobiographical. He said, &quot;the series reflects where I was and where I am. It&#x27;s my diary. I have to have some new thing happening in my life that engages me. I wrap a mystery around that. That&#x27;s why there aren&#x27;t more books. I&#x27;ve always been told that I should be doing one every year-and-a-half. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t treat it like a television series, every week a new mystery.&quot; Simon published eight books about Wine over a 30-year period, from 1974 to 2003. No new Moses Wine volumes have appeared since then.

=== Non-fiction books ===

==== &quot;Turning Right at Hollywood and Vine: The Perils of Coming Out Conservative in Tinseltown&quot; ====

First published as &quot;Blacklisting Myself&quot;, this short memoir was Simon&#x27;s first book-length work of non-fiction. It describes his gradual political turn from left to right as well as many personal adventures in movie business working with such well known figures as Richard Dreyfuss, Richard Pryor, Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky.

==== &quot;I Know Best: How Moral Narcissism Is Destroying Our Republic, If It Hasn&#x27;t Already&quot; ====

An outgrowth of Simon&#x27;s political writing, this book explains how moral narcissism is a threat to our republic. Unlike the conventional narcissism of a Greek youth transfixed by his handsome reflection in a pool, this is a narcissism of ideology. What you proclaim are your ideas and values, Simon warns, not their results are what makes you &quot;good&quot;. The first chapter of this book was reprinted in Commentary magazine.

== Screenplays ==

Besides &quot;The Big Fix&quot;, among Simon&#x27;s other screenwriting credits are &quot;Bustin&#x27; Loose&quot;, with Richard Pryor, &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot; with Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver, &quot;My Man Adam&quot; which Simon also directed, and &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot;, with Woody Allen and Bette Midler. Simon also received story credit on &quot;A Better Life&quot;, a movie about an undocumented immigrant working as a gardener in Los Angeles while struggling to keep his son away from gangs.

== Awards ==

Simon was nominated for an Academy Award for co-writing the screenplay of the 1989 film &quot;Enemies, a Love Story&quot; based on the novel by Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer.

The Moses Wine novels have been nominated for the Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. &quot;The Big Fix&quot; received the John Creasey Award for best first crime novel from the Crime Writers of Great Britain.

== Political views ==
Simon remained conventionally liberal until the 1990s when he began asking questions in response to events such as the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Simon, a former civil rights activist in the 1960s, said he was shocked by &quot;the kind of essential dishonesty to justice&quot; of Simpson&#x27;s acquittal. Simon said, &quot;I found the use of racial politics in the O.J. trial so repellent to me, morally, but also, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was happening right there in front of my eyes. It started to shake up some things. And then came 9/11.&quot;

Simon experienced a political transformation in which he felt alienated from what he saw as the excesses of the Left after the realities of the September 11 attacks affected him. He jokes, &quot;I may be the first American writer who was profiled both by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and &quot;National Review&quot;.&quot; He supports same-sex marriage and the War on Terror, and contends that those issues are linked. He also edits a weblog. In 2005 he founded, with jazz guitarist Charles Johnson, webmaster of the Little Green Footballs weblog, a startup company called Pajamas Media. Pajamas Media, now known as PJ Media, expanded in 2008 into Internet television with Pajamas TV, later known as PJTV. Simon, with screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd, hosts PJTV&#x27;s &quot;Poliwood&quot; show, covering the intersection of politics and Hollywood.

Simon&#x27;s first non-fiction book, &quot;Blacklisting Myself: Memoir of a Hollywood Apostate in the Age of Terror&quot;, was published by Encounter Books in February 2009. It was republished in 2011 with additional material under the title &quot;Turning Right at Hollywood and Vine: The Perils of Coming Out Conservative in Tinseltown&quot;

In May 2015, Simon began writing the Diary of a Mad Voter blog for PJ Media to cover the presidential election of 2016, interviewing major candidates in print and video.

Simon&#x27;s recent book -&quot;I Know Best: How Moral Narcissism Is Destroying Our Republic, If It hasn&#x27;t Already&quot; – was published by Encounter Books in June 2016.

== Education and personal life ==
Born to a Jewish family in New York City on November 22, 1943, Simon is a graduate of Dartmouth College and the Yale School of Drama. He has been married three times. He is currently married to Sheryl Longin, who wrote the screenplay for &quot;Dick,&quot; a film spoof of events in the Watergate political scandal. In 1997 Simon directed the feature film &quot;Prague Duet&quot; based on a script he wrote with Longin. They currently live in Nashville, Tennessee with their daughter.

<text>Robert George &quot;Bob&quot; Wilmers (April 20, 1934 – December 16, 2017) was an American billionaire banker. He was the chairman and CEO of M&amp;T Bank from 1983 until his death in 2017, except for an 18-month break in 2005 - 2006.

==Early life and education==
Robert George Wilmers was born in New York on April 20, 1934, as one of three children to Charles Wilmers, an executive with the Belgium utility holding company, Sofina, who would eventually become its president, and his wife Cecilia. He grew up in New York City and Belgium. His sister Mary-Kay Wilmers is the editor of the London Review of Books, the well-known literary journal.

He graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College (1956), and attended the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

==Career==
He started his career at Bankers Trust Co. in 1962, served in New York City government under mayor John Lindsay as a financial official in the 1960s, then went on to work at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company.

He served as chairman and CEO of M&amp;T Bank and its subsidiary, Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (M&amp;T Bank) since 1983.

In 1992, the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Management named Wilmers Niagara Frontier Executive of the Year. In 1991, the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce named him Western New Yorker of the Year. He received honorary degrees from Canisius College (1988), Niagara University (1991) and the State University of New York at Buffalo (2004). He was cited by The Buffalo News in 1987 and 1994 as a Citizen of the Year. Wilmers retired as CEO in 2005 but returned 18 months later after his successor, Robert Sadler, stepped down from the post and later received the 2005 American Banker Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2008, Wilmers was awarded Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the President of France. In December 2011, he was named Banker of the Year by American Banker.

He purchased Chateau Haut-Bailly, a winery in Bordeaux, France, in 1998.

He served as chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation from 2008 to 2009, chairman of the New York State Bankers Association in 2002 and as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1993 to 1998.

In 2011, he was named &quot;banker of the year&quot; by &quot;American Banker&quot;.

In 2016, together with several partners, he purchased a group of newspapers in western New England, including &quot;The Berkshire Eagle&quot; of Pittsfield, MA.

In January 2017, the rising value of bank stocks meant that Wilmers had become a billionaire.

==Personal life and death==
His widow Elisabeth Wilmers is French, and they owned Château Haut-Bailly from 1998 until his death, as well as the nearby property Château Le Pape from 2012 onwards.

Wilmers died at his home in New York City on December 16, 2017. The cause of death was a heart attack while recovering from a recent surgery.

<text>Miller James Huggins (March 27, 1878 – September 25, 1929) was an American professional baseball player and manager. Huggins played second base for the Cincinnati Reds (1904–1909) and St. Louis Cardinals (1910–1916). He managed the Cardinals (1913–1917) and New York Yankees (1918–1929), including the Murderers&#x27; Row teams of the 1920s that won six American League (AL) pennants and three World Series championships.

Huggins was born in Cincinnati. He received a degree in law from the University of Cincinnati, where he was also captain on the baseball team. Rather than serve as a lawyer, Huggins chose to pursue a professional baseball career. He played semi-professional and minor league baseball from 1898 through 1903, at which time he signed with the Reds.

As a player, Huggins was adept at getting on base. He was also an excellent fielding second baseman, earning the nicknames &quot;Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Little Everywhere&quot;, and &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; for his defensive prowess and was later considered an intelligent manager who understood the fundamentals of the game. Despite fielding successful teams for the Yankees in the 1920s, he continued to make personnel changes in order to maintain his teams&#x27; superiority in the AL. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1964.

==Early life==
Miller James Huggins was born on March 27, 1878, in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his father, an Englishman, worked as a grocer. His mother was a native of Cincinnati. He had two brothers and one sister.
Huggins attended Woodward High School and Walnut Hills High School, both in Cincinnati.

==College career==
Huggins attended the University of Cincinnati, where he studied law and played college baseball for the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team. A shortstop, he was named team captain of the Bearcats in 1900. Seeing him consumed with baseball, his law professors summoned him to justify why they should keep him in the law program.

Huggins&#x27; father, a devout Methodist, objected to his son playing baseball on Sundays. But Huggins played semi-professional baseball in 1898 for the Cincinnati Shamrocks, a team organized by Julius Fleischmann, where he played under the pseudonym &quot;Proctor&quot; due to his father&#x27;s opposition and his amateur status. In 1900, he played for Fleischmann&#x27;s semiprofessional team based in the Catskill Mountains, the Mountain Tourists, leading the team with a .400 batting average.

After receiving his law degree from Cincinnati, Huggins realized that he could make even more money playing baseball, and as such William Howard Taft, one of Huggins&#x27; law professors, advised him to play baseball. He was admitted to the bar, but never practiced law.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Huggins began his playing career in minor league baseball with the Mansfield Haymakers of the Class B Interstate League in 1899. He continued his minor league apprenticeship with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association from 1901 through 1903. After starting his career as an exclusively right-handed hitter, he began to bat from the left side in 1902 in response to his offensive struggles in the 1901 season while also moving to second base during his time at St. Paul.
Huggins handled 19 fielding chances, 11 putouts and nine assists, without committing an error in a game with the Saints in 1902; the previous Major League Baseball (MLB) record being 18, set by Fred Dunlap in 1882. In 1903, he pulled off the first delayed steal in recorded baseball history. Fleischmann, part-owner of the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL), kept an eye on Huggins while he played for St. Paul.

===Cincinnati Reds (1904–1909)===
The Reds duly purchased his contract from the Saints before the 1904 season. He made his MLB debut on April 15, 1904, and proved very adept at getting on base. He batted .264 with the Reds that season and improved in the 1906 season, finishing with a .292 batting average and 41 stolen bases, while spending considerable time developing his upper-body strength.

Although Huggins hoped to be selected as Ned Hanlon&#x27;s successor as Cincinnati&#x27;s manager after the 1907 season, the Reds instead went with John Ganzel. In 1908, he played with the Reds in the Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series. Hampered by a broken ankle and torn ligaments in his shoulder, he slumped to .209 in 1909.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1910–1917)===
Before the 1910 season, the Reds traded Huggins, along with Frank Corridon and Rebel Oakes, to the St. Louis Cardinals in return for Fred Beebe and Alan Storke. He set an MLB record on June 1, 1910, with six plate appearances but no at bats, with four walks and two sacrifice flies. In the same year, he batted .265 for the Cardinals and led the NL in walks.
On July 13, 1911, he tied the NL record for successful fielding chances in a game with 16. At the end of the season, he finished sixth in the voting for the Chalmers Award for Most Valuable Player. In 1912, he hit over .300 for the first time in his career. Huggins became player-manager for the Cardinals after the 1912 season, succeeding Roger Bresnahan. Team owner Helene Hathaway Britton preferred Huggins&#x27; &quot;gentlemanly&quot; manner over Bresnahan&#x27;s rougher personality.

With the acquisition of speed in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, including Dots Miller, Art Butler, Cozy Dolan and Chief Wilson, the Cardinals contended for the NL pennant in 1914. Finishing in third place, it was the Cardinals&#x27; best finish since 1876, but they fell back to sixth in 1915 and last in 1916. When Britton sold the team after that season, she offered Huggins a chance to buy a part of the team. While he was attempting to raise money from the Fleischmann family, Britton sold the team to a group headed by Samuel Breadon, who hired Branch Rickey to run the team&#x27;s day-to-day operations in the front office.

Huggins had coached the young Rogers Hornsby, helping him to correct his batting stance, and Hornsby duly succeeded him as the team&#x27;s starting second baseman in 1917 as Huggins ended his playing career. He managed the team during 1917, the last year of his contract, but was not retained.

==Managerial career==
===New York Yankees (1918–1929)===
With the New York Yankees of the American League (AL) not performing well, Yankees owners Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L&#x27;Hommedieu Huston sought to replace &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Donovan as manager. Ban Johnson, AL president, suggested Huggins to Ruppert as a replacement for Donovan. Huston, who had been in Europe at the time that Ruppert had made the appointment, disliked Huggins and wanted to hire Wilbert Robinson, his drinking buddy. Ruppert himself had been put off by Huggins&#x27; wool cap and practice of smoking pipes in public, which he felt was the mark of the working class. However, Ruppert interviewed Huggins upon Johnson&#x27;s recommendation, and agreed that Huggins knew much about baseball. Ruppert offered the job to Huggins, who initially did not want to take the position, as the Yankees were in no better a position than the Cardinals. J. G. Taylor Spink of &quot;The Sporting News&quot; eventually convinced Huggins to accept the offer, and he signed a two-year contract. The hiring of Huggins drove a wedge between the two co-owners that culminated in Huston selling his shares of the team to Ruppert in 1922.
Having taken charge Huggins did not shy away from making personnel changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees in the art of the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), a move that led to criticism in the press.

In Huggins&#x27; first season with the Yankees, the team finished fourth in the AL. After that season, he obtained Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard and Duffy Lewis from the Boston Red Sox, for Ray Caldwell, Frank Gilhooley, Slim Love, and Roxy Walters. The following year he traded Pratt, Muddy Ruel, Hank Thormahlen and Sammy Vick to the Red Sox for Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper, Mike McNally and Wally Schang. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the Yankees for a reported $12,000.

Huston continually took the side of his players in any argument they had against Huggins, criticizing Huggins in the press when the Yankees lost the pennant in 1920. Meanwhile, Ruppert was at best a lukewarm advocate of Huggins. Babe Ruth resisted Huggins&#x27; discipline; he did not respect Huggins due to his small stature, soft-spoken nature, and inability to fight, and Huggins was unable to enforce punishments on Ruth, despite being well educated. The Yankees finished third in the AL in 1919 and 1920. Huggins signed a one-year contract to remain with the team in 1921.
Coming into the 1921 season, Huggins was still experiencing criticism in the press. Hugh Fullerton wrote that &quot;in the past Huggins has not shone as a leader of men&quot;. By that season, Huggins developed Aaron Ward, Wally Pipp, and Bob Shawkey. The Yankees won their first AL pennant in 1921, reaching the World Series for the first time in franchise history, silencing his critics in the press. However, they lost the 1921 World Series to the New York Giants. In response, Huggins sought to add more pitching talent.

Before the 1922 season, Huggins acquired Johnny Mitchell from the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League and traded fan favorite Roger Peckinpaugh along with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, and Jack Quinn to the Red Sox for Everett Scott, Bullet Joe Bush, and Sad Sam Jones. By this time, Ruppert hired Ed Barrow as the team&#x27;s business manager, and he aided Huggins in player transactions. The Yankees repeated as AL champions that season, but lost the 1922 World Series, again to the Giants. With the newly gained confidence of his owners, Huggins was retained as manager.

The Yankees won their first World Series in 1923, preventing the Giants from repeating as champions for the third consecutive season. They were unable to retain their title the following season however, finishing second in the AL to the Washington Senators.

Huggins had come to regret his trade of Urban Shocker to the Browns. In St. Louis, the spitballer Shocker had come into his own as a starter, racking up four straight 20-win seasons (1920–23) and leading the American League with 27 wins in 1921 and strikeouts the following year, when he won 24 games. Shocker was reacquired for Bullet Joe Bush, Milt Gaston and Joe Giard in December 1924.

However, through 42 games of the 1925 season, the Yankees struggled, falling to seventh place in the eight-team AL, games out of first place. Huggins made wholesale changes to the Yankees&#x27; lineup, as he replaced Ward at second base with Howard Shanks, catchers Steve O&#x27;Neill and Wally Schang with Benny Bengough, and, most notably, Pipp with Lou Gehrig at first base, beginning Gehrig&#x27;s record consecutive games played streak. Among the team&#x27;s regulars, only Babe Ruth, Joe Dugan, and Bob Meusel remained in the lineup. However, the team continued to struggle; amid rumors that he might replace Huggins, Ruppert stated that &quot;Miller Huggins will be manager as long as he cares to be&quot;. The Yankees fell to seventh place in the AL that season.

With Ruppert&#x27;s full support, Huggins&#x27; duties with the Yankees included keeping Ruth in line. Unafraid of his star player, Huggins and Ruth often clashed. Huggins suspended Ruth indefinitely on August 29, 1925, for &quot;misconduct off the playing field&quot;, while also fining him $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and as it was an away game in St. Louis, Ruth was ordered to pay his own way back to New York. The actual reason was because he arrived late for batting practice after yet another night out the night before, though it was a culmination of his pranks and insistence of recruiting less able teammates to go clubbing with him, causing them to nurse hangovers. Ruth responded by claiming Ruppert would rescind the fine and suspension, and that he would never play for Huggins again, believing that Ruppert would side with him over Huggins. However, Ruppert insisted that the fine would stand and that Ruth would be suspended for as long as Huggins desired. After apologizing to Huggins and Ruppert, Ruth was reinstated on September 5. Ruth did not challenge Huggins&#x27; authority again.
Huggins restructured the team for the 1926 season, giving starting jobs to Mark Koenig and Tony Lazzeri. That season, Huggins won his fourth pennant with the Yankees in 1926, marking the first time that a team won a pennant after finishing seventh the year prior. However, the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals in seven games.

Winning the pennant once again in the 1927 season, Huggins matched Cap Anson&#x27;s mark of five pennants in seven seasons. That year, the Yankees benefited from the development of George Pipgras and Wilcy Moore, and set an American League record with 110 regular season victories, winning the AL by 19 games. The Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. This team became known as Murderers&#x27; Row, and is considered one of the greatest teams in baseball history.

Huggins remained confident in his team&#x27;s ability to repeat as AL champions in 1928 season. Huggins supplemented his team by acquiring Bill Dickey from the minor leagues. He acquired Stan Coveleski, who was attempting to return to his peak years, but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle. The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant in eight years, and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0. This was the first time a team swept their opponents in consecutive World Series&#x27;.

Huggins continued to tinker with his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as it became clear that the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929, Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.

==Death==

Huggins fell ill on September 20, 1929, and checked into Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas. His condition was complicated by the development of influenza with high fever. The Yankees&#x27; club physician, in consultation with other doctors, decided to administer blood transfusions.
But despite their best efforts, Huggins died at the age of 51 on September 25, 1929, of pyaemia. The American League canceled its games for September 27, the day of his funeral, and his viewing at Yankee Stadium drew thousands of tearful fans. A moment of silence was held for Huggins before the start of Game 4 of the 1929 World Series (at Philadelphia&#x27;s Shibe Park, after which the A&#x27;s overcame an 8–0 Cubs advantage with 10 runs in the last of the seventh for a spectacular 10–8 come-from-behind victory and a 3–1 Series advantage). He was interred in Spring Grove Cemetery in his native Cincinnati.

The Yankees found it difficult to replace Huggins. Art Fletcher managed the team for its final 11 games of the 1929 season, but he did not want to manage the team full-time. After the season, Ruppert offered the job in turn to Fletcher, Donie Bush and Eddie Collins, all of whom declined. Eventually, &quot;Bob the Gob&quot; Shawkey agreed to serve as the Yankees manager for the 1930 season, leading the team to a third-place finish.

==Playing and managing profile==
Huggins was listed at and . His small stature inspired the nicknames &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; and the &quot;Mite Manager&quot;. He was also known as &quot;Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Little Everywhere&quot; for his ability to cover ground in the infield. An excellent leadoff batter and defensive second baseman, he ended his playing career with a .265 batting average and .956 fielding percentage. He led the league in walks four times and regularly posted an on-base percentage near .400. He scored 100 or more runs three times and regularly stole 30 or more bases for 324 lifetime steals. On the downside, in 1914 he set the single season caught-stealing record in the National League, when he was thrown out 36 times (as opposed to 32 successful steals).

Huggins finished his managerial career with a 1413–1134 record. His 1413 wins as a manager ranks 23rd all-time (as of the start of the 2012 season). He learned his managerial strategy by observing Hanlon and Bresnahan. His managerial style at first emphasized speed, base-stealing, hit- and-run plays and &quot;slap&quot; (i.e., contact) hitting, but the acquisition of superstar slugger Ruth dictated a change of emphasis towards power and not giving away outs. For the slugging Yankees of the 1920s, he recruited power hitters and consistent (as opposed to brilliant) pitchers.

===Managerial record===
==Legacy==
In 1915, umpire and sportswriter Billy Evans, writing about the scarcity of competent second basemen in baseball, listed Huggins, Collins, Pratt, Johnny Evers, and Nap Lajoie as the best in the game. He later wrote that Huggins was &quot;one of the greatest managers I have ever met&quot;. Bill James ranked Huggins as the 37th best second baseman of all time in 2001 in his &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;.

The Yankees dedicated a monument to Huggins on May 30, 1932, placing it in front of the flagpole in center field at Yankee Stadium. Huggins was the first Yankees legend granted this honor. Later, posthumous monuments were added there for Lou Gehrig in 1941, and Babe Ruth in 1949. These always remained within the field of play, so long as Yankees Stadium maintained its original commodious outfield dimensions (that reached 461 feet in right center).

Many years later, with the outfield shrunk to barely over 400 feet in a sweeping stadium remodel, the memorials were relocated to a &quot;Monument Park&quot; created behind the centerfield fence, and dedicated in 1976. Since that time, additional monuments have been placed for Mickey Mantle (1996), Joe DiMaggio (1999), and George Steinbrenner (2010), again all posthumous.

The plaque on Huggins’ monument describes him as &quot;A splendid character who made priceless contributions to baseball.&quot; The Yankees also named a field at Al Lang Stadium, their spring training home in Florida, after Huggins.

Huggins was included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1942, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1950, failing to receive the number of votes required for election on those occasions. Named in the Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946, the Veterans Committee elected Huggins to the Hall of Fame in February 1964, and he was posthumously inducted that summer.

==Personal life==
Huggins was a private man who kept to himself. He lived in Cincinnati during the winters while playing for the Reds and Cardinals, but began to make St. Petersburg, Florida, his winter home while managing the Yankees. Huggins did not marry, and lived with his sister while in Cincinnati.

Huggins invested in real estate holdings in Florida, although he sold them in 1926 (three years before the stock market crash, fortunately for him) as they took too much of his time away from baseball. He enjoyed playing golf and billiards in his spare time.

He was portrayed by Ernie Adams in &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, Fred Lightner in &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot;, Bruce Weitz in &quot;Babe Ruth&quot;, and Joe Ragno in &quot;The Babe&quot;.

<text>Durex is a British brand of condoms and personal lubricants owned by Reckitt Benckiser and currently led by Ben Wilson. It was initially developed in London under the purview of the London Rubber Company and British Latex Products Ltd, where it was manufactured between 1932 and 1994. The London Rubber Company was formed in 1915, and the Durex brand name (&quot;Durability, reliability, and excellence&quot;) was launched in 1929, although London Rubber did not begin manufacturing own-brand condoms until 1932, in collaboration with a rubber technology student from Poland named Lucian Lundau. The first book on The London Rubber Company and the history of Durex condoms, written by Jessica Borge, was published in September 2020 by McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press.

The London Rubber Company later merged with SSL International, and has since 2010 been owned by the Anglo-Dutch company Reckitt Benckiser. It is one of the best-selling condom brands around the world, with 30% of the global market. In 2006, Durex condoms were the second-best-selling brand of condoms in the United States, with Trojan condoms being the first. It is supplied by, among others, the company Karex.

In 2007, the last factory making Durex condoms in the UK stopped manufacturing and production has since moved to China, India and Thailand. The modern range includes a wide variety of latex condom, including the &quot;Sheik&quot; and &quot;Ramses&quot; brands in North America, and the &quot;Avanti&quot; condom. Durex also provides a range of lubricants and sex toys.

Although Durex was not an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, Durex provided 150,000 free condoms to more than 10,000 athletes that competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

== Market share ==
=== China ===
Although condoms are not a widely used form of contraception in China, with only around 10% of sexually active people using them, among Chinese condom users Durex has a dominant market share of 45% as of 2015. Due to a relatively conservative culture surrounding sex, Durex&#x27;s marketing in China is often indirect and subtle, often involving lighthearted humour. Marketing is done almost exclusively on social media. Durex has operated an account on the microblogging site Weibo in 2011, which had 2.65 million followers and more than 20,000 posts as of 2018. Durex targets Chinese users on Sina Weibo aged from 20 to 40, and primarily men under 35 years old. In 2011, Durex began cross-industry advertising tie-ins with the antivirus software company Trend Micro, using the common themes of &quot;antivirus&quot; and &quot;security&quot;.

<text>Mary Howarth Arden, Baroness Mance, , PC (born 23 January 1947), known professionally as Lady Arden of Heswall, is a former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Before that, she was a judge of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.

==Early life and education==

Mary Howarth Arden was born in Liverpool, the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Eric Cuthbert Arden, of Heswall, Cheshire, a solicitor who had served with the Royal Garrison Artillery, and Mary Margaret (née Smith). Her grandfather was a partner in Gamon Arden and Co., a Liverpool firm of solicitors. Her father and brother, Roger, joined the family firm which merged with Hill Dickinson in 2007. She was brought up in south Liverpool and educated at Huyton College. She read law at Girton College, Cambridge, where she gained a starred first and an LLM, and an LLM degree at Harvard Law School in 1970 as a Kennedy Scholar.

== Career ==

She was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1971, and joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1973. She practised at Erskine Chambers from 1971 to 1993, mainly in company law. She became a QC in 1986, and served as Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster. She is an Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge, Royal Holloway, University of London, and of Liverpool John Moores University.

She was appointed to the High Court on 30 April 1993, becoming the first female High Court judge to be assigned to the Chancery Division. As is customary, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) at the same time. Arden was chairman of the Law Commission from 1996 to 1999. On 2 October 2000, she was also appointed to the Court of Appeal.

Other posts held by Arden include her membership of the Steering Group of the Company Law Review, and a current post as Head of International Judicial Relations for England and Wales. She is a member of the advisory board, Centre of Commercial Law; of the Council of the Statute Law Society; of the Board of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, as well as being President of the Trinity Hall Law Society, and of the Association of Women Barristers. She is a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.

Arden&#x27;s appointment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, replacing her husband Lord Mance on the court, was announced in June 2018, to take effect on 1 October 2018. On entering her office, she took the judicial courtesy title of Lady Arden of Heswall. She was the only woman out of the eleven judges of the court between the retirement of Lady Black of Derwent in January 2021 and the appointment of Lady Black&#x27;s successor, Lady Rose of Colmworth, in April 2021.

By the time she retired in 2022, she was the eldest of the justices (Lord Lloyd-Jones was the second-eldest at 69). Following the retirement (and death) of Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore in 2020 she was the only remaining member to have held judicial office before 31 March 1995 and was thus allowed to retire at 75 instead of 70.

== Personal life ==

She married Jonathan Mance (now Lord Mance, former Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) in the Lady Chapel at Liverpool Cathedral in 1973; they have three children:
* Abigail Mance, a speech therapist
* Jessica Mance, a barrister
* Henry Mance, chief features writer at the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

Arden&#x27;s husband, Lord Mance, joined the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division in October 1993, making them the first married couple to sit on the High Court bench. The couple also became the first married couple both to sit on the Court of Appeal.

By virtue of her marriage, Lady Arden of Heswall is entitled to be styled The Lady Mance, but is instead known by her own judicial title.

==Honours==

* She was appointed as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1986.
* She was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Civil Division on 30 April 1993 upon being made a High Court Judge. This gave her the right to be referred to as Dame Mary Arden.
* She was elected an Honorary Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge in 1995.
* She was appointed to the Court of Appeal on 2 October 2000. At this time She was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. This gave her the honorific style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* She is an Honorary Fellow of Royal Holloway, University of London and Liverpool John Moores University.
* In 2002 she was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LLD) from the University of Nottingham.

==Judgments==

Arden&#x27;s judgments include:

<text>In graph theory, a cocoloring of a graph &quot;G&quot; is an assignment of colors to the vertices such that each color class forms an independent set in &quot;G&quot; or in the complement of &quot;G&quot;. The cochromatic number z(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; is the fewest colors needed in any cocolorings of &quot;G&quot;. The graphs with cochromatic number 2 are exactly the bipartite graphs, complements of bipartite graphs, and split graphs.

As the requirement that each color class be a clique or independent is weaker than the requirement for coloring (in which each color class must be an independent set) and stronger than for subcoloring (in which each color class must be a disjoint union of cliques), it follows that the cochromatic number of &quot;G&quot; is less than or equal to the chromatic number of &quot;G&quot;, and that it is greater than or equal to the subchromatic number of &quot;G&quot;.

Cocoloring was named and first studied by . characterizes critical 3-cochromatic graphs, while describe algorithms for approximating the cochromatic number of a graph. defines a class of &quot;perfect cochromatic graphs&quot;, analogous to the definition of perfect graphs via graph coloring, and provides a forbidden subgraph characterization of these graphs.

<text>Robert Mallet (3 June 1810 – 5 November 1881) was an Irish geophysicist, civil engineer, and inventor who distinguished himself by research concerning earthquakes (and is sometimes known as the father of seismology). His son, Frederick Richard Mallet, was a geologist who worked in India.

==Early life==
Mallet was born in Dublin, on 3 June 1810, the son of factory owner John Mallet. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, entering it at the age of 16 and graduating in science and mathematics in 1830 at the age of 20.

==Career==
After his graduation, he joined his father&#x27;s iron foundry business and helped build the business into one of the most important engineering works in Ireland, supplying ironwork for railway companies, the Fastnet Rock lighthouse, and a swing bridge over the River Shannon at Athlone. He also helped manufacture the characteristic iron railings that surround Trinity College and which bear his family name at the base.

Mallet was elected to the Royal Irish Academy in 1832 at the early age of 22. He also enrolled in the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1835 which helped finance much of his research of seismology.

In 1838 he became a life member of the Royal Geological Society of Ireland, and acted as its President from 1846–48. From 1848–1849 he managed the construction of the Fastnet Rock lighthouse, southwest of Cape Clear.

===Seismological work===
On 9 February 1846 he presented to the Royal Irish Academy his paper, &quot;On the Dynamics Of Earthquakes&quot;, which is considered to be one of the origins of modern seismology. He is also credited with inventing the word &quot;seismology&quot; and some related words, e.g. the isoseismal map, which he used for his research. He also invented the term &quot;epicentre&quot;.

From 1852 to 1858, he was prepared (with his son, John William Mallet) his work, &quot;The Earthquake Catalogue of the British Association&quot; (1858), and performed blasting experiments to determine the speed of seismic propagation in sand and solid rock.

On 16 December 1857, the area around Padula, Italy, was devastated by the Great Neapolitan earthquake which caused 11,000 deaths. At the time it was the third largest known earthquake in world history and has been estimated to have been of magnitude 7.0 on the Moment magnitude scale. Mallet, with letters of endorsement from Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin, petitioned the Royal Society of London and received a grant of £150 to go to Padula and record the devastation personally. The resulting report was presented to the Royal Society as the &quot;Report on the Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857&quot;. It was a major scientific work and made great use of the then new process of photography to record the devastation caused by the earthquake. In 1862, he published the &quot;Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857: The First Principles of Observational Seismology&quot; in two volumes; he brought forward evidence to show that the depth below the Earth&#x27;s surface, from where the impulse of the Neapolitan earthquake originated, was about 8–9 geographical miles.

One of Mallet&#x27;s papers was &quot;Volcanic Energy: an Attempt to develop its True Origin and Cosmical Relations&quot;, in which he sought to show that volcanic heat may be attributed to the effects of crushing, contortion and other disturbances in the crust of the earth; the disturbances resulting in the formation of lines of fracture, more or less vertical, down which water would find its way, and if the temperature generated be sufficient volcanic eruptions of steam or lava would follow.

===Other work===
During the Crimean War he designed a mortar of calibre capable of throwing a shell a distance of . The huge mortar was built in sections to allow transport, but was too late to be used in action. An example has been preserved at the Royal Artillery base in Woolwich and one is displayed before the Royal Armouries Fort Nelson near Portsmouth.

Mallet was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1854, and in 1861 relocated to London, where he became a consulting engineer and edited &quot;The Practical Mechanic&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1859, followed by the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy for his research into the theory of earthquakes in 1862 and the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society of London in 1877, the Geological Society&#x27;s greatest award.

Blind for the last seven years of his life, he died at Stockwell, London, on 5 November 1881 and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

<text>True-range multilateration (also termed range-range multilateration and spherical multilateration) is a method to determine the location of a movable vehicle or stationary point in space using multiple ranges (distances) between the vehicle/point and multiple spatially-separated known locations (often termed &quot;stations&quot;). Energy waves may be involved in determining range, but are not required.

True-range multilateration is both a mathematical topic and an applied technique used in several fields. A practical application involving a fixed location occurs in surveying. Applications involving vehicle location are termed navigation when on-board persons/equipment are informed of its location, and are termed surveillance when off-vehicle entities are informed of the vehicle&#x27;s location.

Two &quot;slant ranges&quot; from two known locations can be used to locate a third point in a two-dimensional Cartesian space (plane), which is a frequently applied technique (e.g., in surveying). Similarly, two &quot;spherical ranges&quot; can be used to locate a point on a sphere, which is a fundamental concept of the ancient discipline of celestial navigation — termed the &quot;altitude intercept&quot; problem. Moreover, if more than the minimum number of ranges are available, it is good practice to utilize those as well. This article addresses the general issue of position determination using multiple ranges.
In two-dimensional geometry, it is known that if a point lies on two circles, then the circle centers and the two radii provide sufficient information to narrow the possible locations down to two – one of which is the desired solution and the other is an ambiguous solution. Additional information often narrow the possibilities down to a unique location. In three-dimensional geometry, when it is known that a point lies on the surfaces of three spheres, then the centers of the three spheres along with their radii also provide sufficient information to narrow the possible locations down to no more than two (unless the centers lie on a straight line).

True-range multilateration can be contrasted to the more frequently encountered pseudo-range multilateration, which employs range differences to locate a (typically, movable) point. Pseudo range multilateration is almost always implemented by measuring times-of-arrival (TOAs) of energy waves. True-range multilateration can also be contrasted to triangulation, which involves the measurement of angles.

==Terminology==
There is no accepted or widely-used general term for what is termed &quot;true-range multilateration&quot; here . That name is selected because it: (a) is an accurate description and partially familiar terminology (&quot;multilateration&quot; is often used in this context); (b) avoids specifying the number of ranges involved (as does, e.g., &quot;range-range&quot;; (c) avoids implying an application (as do, e.g., &quot;DME/DME navigation&quot; or &quot;trilateration&quot;) and (d) and avoids confusion with the more common pseudo-range multilateration.

== Obtaining ranges ==
For similar ranges and measurement errors, a navigation and surveillance system based on true-range multilateration provide service to a significantly larger 2-D area or 3-D volume than systems based on pseudo-range multilateration. However, it is often more difficult or costly to measure true-ranges than it is to measure pseudo ranges. For distances up to a few miles and fixed locations, true-range can be measured manually. This has been done in surveying for several thousand years e.g., using ropes and chains.

For longer distances and/or moving vehicles, a radio/radar system is generally needed. This technology was first developed circa 1940 in conjunction with radar. Since then, three methods have been employed:
* Two-way range measurement, one party active This is the method used by traditional radars (sometimes termed &quot;primary&quot; radars) to determine the range of a non-cooperative target, and now used by laser rangefinders. Its major limitations are that: (a) the target does not identify itself, and in a multiple target situation, mis-assignment of a return can occur; (b) the return signal is attenuated (relative to the transmitted signal) by the fourth power of the vehicle-station range (thus, for distances of tens of miles or more, stations generally require high-power transmitters and/or large/sensitive antennas); and (c) many systems utilize line-of-sight propagation, which limits their ranges to less than 20 miles when both parties are at similar heights above sea level.
* Two-way range measurement, both parties active This method was reportedly first used for navigation by the Y-Gerät aircraft guidance system fielded in 1941 by the Luftwaffe. It is now used globally in air traffic control – e.g., &quot;secondary&quot; radar surveillance and DME/DME navigation. It requires that both parties have both transmitters and receivers, and may require that interference issues be addressed.
* One-way range measurement The time of flight (TOF) of electromagnetic energy between multiple stations and the vehicle is measured based on transmission by one party and reception by the other. This is the most recently developed method, and was enabled by the development of atomic clocks; it requires that the vehicle (user) and stations having synchronized clocks. It has been successfully demonstrated (experimentally) with Loran-C and GPS.

== Solution methods ==

&quot;True-range multilateration&quot; algorithms may be partitioned based on 
* problem space dimension (generally, two or three), 
* problem space geometry (generally, Cartesian or spherical) and 
* presence of redundant measurements (more than the problem space dimension).
Any pseudo-range multilateration algorithm can be specialized for use with true-range multilateration. 

=== Two Cartesian dimensions, two measured slant ranges (trilateration) ===

An analytic solution has likely been known for over 1,000 years, and is given in several texts. Moreover, one can easily adapt algorithms for a three dimensional Cartesian space.

The simplest algorithm employs analytic geometry and a station-based coordinate frame. Thus, consider the circle centers (or stations) C1 and C2 in Fig. 1 which have known coordinates (e.g., have already been surveyed) and thus whose separation formula_1 is known. The figure &#x27;page&#x27; contains C1 and C2. If a third &#x27;point of interest&#x27; P (e.g., a vehicle or another point to be surveyed) is at unknown point formula_2, then Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem yields

: formula_3

Thus, 
Note that formula_4 has two values (i.e., solution is ambiguous); this is usually not a problem. 

While there are many enhancements, Equation is the most fundamental true-range multilateration relationship. Aircraft DME/DME navigation and the trilateration method of surveying are examples of its application. During World War II Oboe and during the Korean War SHORAN used the same principle to guide aircraft based on measured ranges to two ground stations. SHORAN was later used for off-shore oil exploration and for aerial surveying. The Australian Aerodist aerial survey system utilized 2-D Cartesian true-range multilateration. This 2-D scenario is sufficiently important that the term &quot;trilateration&quot; is often applied to all applications involving a known baseline and two range measurements.

The baseline containing the centers of the circles is a line of symmetry. The correct and ambiguous solutions are perpendicular to and equally distant from (on opposite sides of) the baseline. Usually, the ambiguous solution is easily identified. For example, if P is a vehicle, any motion toward or away from the baseline will be opposite that of the ambiguous solution; thus, a crude measurement of vehicle heading is sufficient. A second example: surveyors are well aware of which side of the baseline that P lies. A third example: in applications where P is an aircraft and C1 and C2 are on the ground, the ambiguous solution is usually below ground.

If needed, the interior angles of triangle C1-C2-P can be found using the trigonometric law of cosines. Also, if needed, the coordinates of P can be expressed in a second, better-known coordinate system—e.g., the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system—provided the coordinates of C1 and C2 are known in that second system. Both are often done in surveying when the trilateration method is employed. Once the coordinates of P are established, lines C1-P and C2-P can be used as new baselines, and additional points surveyed. Thus, large areas or distances can be surveyed based on multiple, smaller triangles—termed a &quot;traverse&quot;.

An implied assumption for the above equation to be true is that formula_5 and formula_6 relate to the same position of P. When P is a vehicle, then typically formula_5 and formula_6 must be measured within a synchronization tolerance that depends on the vehicle speed and the allowable vehicle position error. Alternatively, vehicle motion between range measurements may be accounted for, often by dead reckoning.

A trigonometric solution is also possible (side-side-side case). Also, a solution employing graphics is possible. A graphical solution is sometimes employed during real-time navigation, as an overlay on a map.

=== Three Cartesian dimensions, three measured slant ranges ===

There are multiple algorithms that solve the 3-D Cartesian true-range multilateration problem directly (i.e., in closed-form) – e.g., Fang. Moreover, one can adopt closed-form algorithms developed for pseudo range multilateration. Bancroft&#x27;s algorithm (adapted) employs vectors, which is an advantage in some situations.

The simplest algorithm corresponds to the sphere centers in Fig. 2. The figure &#x27;page&#x27; is the plane containing C1, C2 and C3. If P is a &#x27;point of interest&#x27; (e.g., vehicle) at formula_9, then Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem yields the slant ranges between P and the sphere centers:

: formula_10

Thus, the coordinates of P are:

The plane containing the sphere centers is a plane of symmetry. The correct and ambiguous solutions are perpendicular to it and equally distant from it, on opposite sides.

Many applications of 3-D true-range multilateration involve short ranges—e.g., precision manufacturing. Integrating range measurement from three or more radars (e.g., FAA&#x27;s ERAM) is a 3-D aircraft surveillance application. 3-D true-range multilateration has been used on an experimental basis with GPS satellites for aircraft navigation. The requirement that an aircraft be equipped with an atomic clock precludes its general use. However, GPS receiver clock aiding is an area of active research, including aiding over a network. Thus, conclusions may change. 3-D true-range multilateration was evaluated by the International Civil Aviation Organization as an aircraft landing system, but another technique was found to be more efficient. Accurately measuring the altitude of aircraft during approach and landing requires many ground stations along the flight path.

=== Two spherical dimensions, two or more measured spherical ranges ===

This is a classic celestial (or astronomical) navigation problem, termed the &quot;altitude intercept&quot; problem (Fig. 3). It&#x27;s the spherical geometry equivalent of the trilateration method of surveying (although the distances involved are generally much larger). A solution at sea (not necessarily involving the Sun and Moon) was made possible by the marine chronometer (introduced in 1761) and the discovery of the &#x27;line of position&#x27; (LOP) in 1837. The solution method now most taught at universities (e.g., U.S. Naval Academy) employs spherical trigonometry to solve an oblique spherical triangle based on sextant measurements of the &#x27;altitude&#x27; of two heavenly bodies. This problem can also be addressed using vector analysis. Historically, graphical techniques – e.g., the intercept method – were employed. These can accommodate more than two measured &#x27;altitudes&#x27;. Owing to the difficulty of making measurements at sea, 3 to 5 &#x27;altitudes&#x27; are often recommended.

As the earth is better modeled as an ellipsoid of revolution than a sphere, iterative techniques may be used in modern implementations. In high-altitude aircraft and missiles, a celestial navigation subsystem is often integrated with an inertial navigation subsystem to perform automated navigation—e.g., U.S. Air Force SR-71 Blackbird and B-2 Spirit.

While intended as a &#x27;spherical&#x27; pseudo range multilateration system, Loran-C has also been used as a &#x27;spherical&#x27; true-range multilateration system by well-equipped users (e.g., Canadian Hydrographic Service). This enabled the coverage area of a Loran-C station triad to be extended significantly (e.g., doubled or tripled) and the minimum number of available transmitters to be reduced from three to two. In modern aviation, slant ranges rather than spherical ranges are more often measured; however, when aircraft altitude is known, slant ranges are readily converted to spherical ranges.

=== Redundant range measurements ===

When there are more range measurements available than there are problem dimensions, either from the same C1 and C2 (or C1, C2 and C3) stations, or from additional stations, at least these benefits accrue: 
* &#x27;Bad&#x27; measurements can be identified and rejected
* Ambiguous solutions can be identified automatically (i.e., without human involvement) -- requires an additional station
* Errors in &#x27;good&#x27; measurements can be averaged, reducing their effect.

The iterative Gauss–Newton algorithm for solving non-linear least squares (NLLS) problems is generally preferred when there are more &#x27;good&#x27; measurements than the minimum necessary. An important advantage of the Gauss–Newton method over many closed-form algorithms is that it treats range errors linearly, which is often their nature, thereby reducing the effect of range errors by averaging. The Gauss–Newton method may also be used with the minimum number of measured ranges. Since it is iterative, the Gauss–Newton method requires an initial solution estimate.

In 3-D Cartesian space, a fourth sphere eliminates the ambiguous solution that occurs with three ranges, provided its center is not co-planar with the first three. In 2-D Cartesian or spherical space, a third circle eliminates the ambiguous solution that occurs with two ranges, provided its center is not co-linear with the first two.

=== One-time application versus repetitive application ===

This article largely describes &#x27;one-time&#x27; application of the true-range multilateration technique, which is the most basic use of the technique. With reference to Fig. 1, the characteristic of &#x27;one-time&#x27; situations is that point P and at least one of C1 and C2 change from one application of the true-range multilateration technique to the next. This is appropriate for surveying, celestial navigation using manual sightings, and some aircraft DME/DME navigation.

However, in other situations, the true-range multilateration technique is applied repetitively (essentially continuously). In those situations, C1 and C2 (and perhaps Cn, n = 3,4...) remain constant and P is the same vehicle. Example applications (and selected intervals between measurements) are: multiple radar aircraft surveillance (5 and 12 seconds, depending upon radar coverage range), aerial surveying, Loran-C navigation with a high-accuracy user clock (roughly 0.1 seconds), and some aircraft DME/DME navigation (roughly 0.1 seconds). Generally, implementations for repetitive use: (a) employ a &#x27;tracker&#x27; algorithm (in addition to the multilateration solution algorithm), which enables measurements collected at different times to be compared and averaged in some manner; and (b) utilize an iterative solution algorithm, as they (b1) admit varying numbers of measurements (including redundant measurements) and (b2) inherently have an initial guess each time the solution algorithm is invoked.

=== Hybrid multilateration systems ===

Hybrid multilateration systems – those that are neither true-range nor pseudo range systems – are also possible. For example, in Fig. 1, if the circle centers are shifted to the left so that C1 is at formula_11 and C2 is at formula_12 then the point of interest P is at

: formula_13

This form of the solution explicitly depends on the sum and difference of formula_14 and formula_15 and does not require &#x27;chaining&#x27; from the formula_16-solution to the formula_17-solution. It could be implemented as a true-range multilateration system by measuring formula_14 and formula_15.

However, it could also be implemented as a hybrid multilateration system by measuring formula_20 and formula_21 using different equipment – e.g., for surveillance by a multistatic radar with one transmitter and two receivers (rather than two monostatic radars). While eliminating one transmitter is a benefit, there is a countervailing &#x27;cost&#x27;: the synchronization tolerance for the two stations becomes dependent on the propagation speed (typically, the speed of light) rather that the speed of point P, in order to accurately measure both formula_22.

While not implemented operationally, hybrid multilateration systems have been investigated for aircraft surveillance near airports and as a GPS navigation backup system for aviation.

== Preliminary and final computations ==


The position accuracy of a true-range multilateration system—e.g., accuracy of the formula_2 coordinates of point P in Fig. 1 -- depends upon two factors: (1) the range measurement accuracy, and (2) the geometric relationship of P to the system&#x27;s stations C1 and C2. This can be understood from Fig. 4. The two stations are shown as dots, and BLU denotes baseline units. (The measurement pattern is symmetric about both the baseline and the perpendicular bisector of the baseline, and is truncated in the figure.) As is commonly done, individual range measurement errors are taken to be independent of range, statistically independent and identically distributed. This reasonable assumption separates the effects of user-station geometry and range measurement errors on the error in the calculated formula_2 coordinates of P. Here, the measurement geometry is simply the angle at which two circles cross—or equivalently, the angle between lines P-C1 and P-C2. When point P- is not on a circle, the error in its position is approximately proportional to the area bounded by the nearest two blue and nearest two magenta circles.

Without redundant measurements, a true-range multilateration system can be no more accurate than the range measurements, but can be significantly less accurate if the measurement geometry is not chosen properly. Accordingly, some applications place restrictions on the location of point P. For a 2-D Cartesian (trilateration) situation, these restrictions take one of two equivalent forms:
* The allowable interior angle at P between lines P-C1 and P-C2: The ideal is a right angle, which occurs at distances from the baseline of one-half or less of the baseline length; maximum allowable deviations from the ideal 90 degrees may be specified.
* The horizontal dilution of precision (HDOP), which multiplies the range error in determining the position error: For two dimensions, the ideal (minimum) HDOP is the square root of 2 (formula_25), which occurs when the angle between P-C1 and P-C2 is 90 degrees; a maximum allowable HDOP value may be specified. (Here, equal HDOPs are simply the locus of points in Fig. 4 having the same crossing angle.)

Planning a true-range multilateration navigation or surveillance system often involves a dilution of precision (DOP) analysis to inform decisions on the number and location of the stations and the system&#x27;s service area (two dimensions) or service volume (three dimensions). Fig. 5 shows horizontal DOPs (HDOPs) for a 2-D, two-station true-range multilateration system. HDOP is infinite along the baseline and its extensions, as only one of the two dimensions is actually measured. A user of such a system should be roughly broadside of the baseline and within an application-dependent range band. For example, for DME/DME navigation fixes by aircraft, the maximum HDOP permitted by the U.S. FAA is twice the minimum possible value, or 2.828, which limits the maximum usage range (which occurs along the baseline bisector) to 1.866 times the baseline length. (The plane containing two DME ground stations and an aircraft is not strictly horizontal, but usually is nearly so.) Similarly, surveyors select point P in Fig. 1 so that C1-C2-P roughly form an equilateral triangle (where HDOP = 1.633).

Errors in trilateration surveys are discussed in several documents. Generally, emphasis is placed on the effects of range measurement errors, rather than on the effects of algorithm numerical errors.

Navigation and surveillance systems typically involve vehicles and require that a government entity or other organization deploy multiple stations that employ a form of radio technology (i.e., utilize electromagnetic waves). The advantages and disadvantages of employing true-range multilateration for such a system are shown in the following table.

True-range multilateration is often contrasted with (pseudo range) multilateration, as both require a form of user ranges to multiple stations. Complexity and cost of user equipage is likely the most important factor in limiting use of true-range multilateration for vehicle navigation and surveillance. Some uses are not the original purpose for system deployment – e.g., DME/DME aircraft navigation.

<text>Bernard Morin (; 3 March 1931 in Shanghai, China – 12 March 2018) was a French mathematician, specifically a topologist.

==Early life and education==
Morin lost his sight at the age of six due to glaucoma, but his blindness did not prevent him from having a successful career in mathematics. He received his Ph.D. in 1972 from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

==Career==
Morin was a member of the group that first exhibited an eversion of the sphere, i.e., a homotopy which starts with a sphere and ends with the same sphere but turned inside-out. He also discovered the Morin surface, which is a half-way model for the sphere eversion, and used it to prove a lower bound on the number of steps needed to turn a sphere inside out.

Morin discovered the first parametrization of Boy&#x27;s surface (earlier used as a half-way model), in 1978. His graduate student François Apéry, in 1986, discovered another parametrization of Boy&#x27;s surface, which conforms to the general method for parametrizing non-orientable surfaces.

Morin worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Most of his career, though, he spent at the University of Strasbourg.

<text>Andrei Medvedev (; born 31 August 1974) is a Ukrainian former professional tennis player. Medvedev reached the final of the 1999 French Open, the French Open semifinals in 1993, and won four Masters titles during his career, achieving a career-high ranking of world No. 4 in May 1994.

==Career==
In 1991, Medvedev won the junior singles title at the French Open.

As a 17 year old the following year, Medvedev won his first two ATP Tour titles in Genoa and Stuttgart (where he beat then-world No. 2 Stefan Edberg, and finished the season ranked within the world&#x27;s top 25. 

His most successful tournament was the Hamburg Masters (formerly the German Open), which he won three times (1994, 1995 and 1997). He reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4.

In the late 1990s, Medvedev&#x27;s form and results began to flounder until he unexpectedly reached the final of the 1999 French Open where — ranked 100 — he defeated Dinu Pescariu, Pete Sampras, Byron Black, Arnaud Di Pasquale, Gustavo Kuerten and Fernando Meligeni en route. Medvedev dominated the first two sets of the final against Andre Agassi before Agassi mounted a come-from-behind victory, which allowed him to complete a career Grand Slam. Afterwards, Medvedev did not score further notable results, and retired from the tour in 2001.

One main rival of Medvedev was Sergi Bruguera. While their head-to-head record ended deadlocked at 5–5, Bruguera was able to win their two most important matches — the semifinals and quarterfinals of the 1993 and 1994 French Opens, respectively, with Bruguera winning both matches in straight sets.

In the French Open tournament, Medvedev lost six times to the eventual champion (1992–95, 1997 and 1999).

==Personal life==
His sister, Natalia Medvedeva, formerly a top 25 player on the WTA Tour, partnered with Andrei to represent Ukraine at the seventh Hopman Cup in 1995, finishing runners-up to Germany&#x27;s Boris Becker and Anke Huber (Medvedev&#x27;s girlfriend back then) in the final.

<doc id="702855" wikidata="Q698220" url="?curid=702855" title="Operation Lüttich">
<text>Operation Lüttich (7–13 August 1944) was the codename of the Nazi German counter-attack during the Battle of Normandy, which occurred near U.S. positions near Mortain, in northwestern France. &quot;Lüttich&quot; is the German name for the city of Liège, Belgium. In British and American histories of the Second World War, the German Operation Lüttich is known as the Mortain counter-attack, which Hitler ordered to regain territory gained by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra by reaching the coast of the Avranches region, which is at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, in order to isolate the units of the Third United States Army that had advanced into Brittany.

The Germans&#x27; main force was the XLVII Panzer Corps, with two &quot;Heer&quot; and one-and-a-half &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; Panzer Divisions. Despite initial success against the defending U.S. VII Corps, the Germans were soon halted, and the Allies inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying most of the German tanks involved in the attack. Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.

As the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armoured reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.

==Background==
On 25 July 1944, following six weeks of attritional warfare along a stalemated front, American forces under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley mounted an attack code-named Operation Cobra, which broke through the German defenses near Saint-Lô. Almost the entire western half of the German front in Normandy collapsed, and on 1 August, American forces captured Avranches. With the capture of this town at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, and an intact bridge at Pontaubault nearby, the American forces had &quot;turned the corner&quot;; the German front could no longer be anchored against the sea at its western end and American forces could advance west and south into Brittany. The U.S. Third Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, was activated the same day. Despite German air attacks against the bridge at Pontaubault, Patton pushed no less than seven divisions across it during the next three days, and units of his army began advancing almost unopposed towards the Brittany ports.

Beginning on 30 July, the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, mounted a supporting attack (code-named Operation Bluecoat) on the eastern flank of the American armies. Much of the German armored reserves being rushed west to halt the American breakthrough were diverted to face this new threat. Meanwhile, the U.S. continued its attacks to widen the corridor around Avranches. Although the Germans held the vital road junction of Vire, U.S. VII Corps, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, captured Mortain, east of Avranches, on 3 August.

The next day, although Major General Troy H. Middleton&#x27;s U.S. VIII Corps continued to advance west through Brittany toward the ports of Brest and Lorient, Bradley ordered Patton to drive eastward with the main body of the U.S. Third Army, around the open German flank and into the German rear areas. Major General Wade H. Haislip&#x27;s U.S. XV Corps advanced no less than during the next three days, and by 7 August they were approaching Le Mans, formerly the location of the headquarters of the German 7th Army, and still an important logistic center.

==German command and decisions==
&quot;Generalfeldmarshall&quot; Günther von Kluge was the German supreme commander in the West. After &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel was injured by Allied aircraft on 17 July, Kluge also took over direct command of Army Group B, the formation conducting the battle in Normandy. He had warned Hitler on 22 July that the collapse of the front was imminent, but Hitler continued to order him to stand fast.

On 2 August, Hitler, fearing the loss of U-boat pens on the French coast, sent a directive to Kluge ordering &quot;an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches&quot;. General Walter Warlimont—the Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW, the German armed forces headquarters—was also sent to Kluge&#x27;s headquarters to ensure these orders were complied with. Kluge suggested that there was no chance of success, and the German forces in Normandy should retire to the Seine River, pivoting on the intact defences south of Caen, but on 4 August, Hitler categorically ordered the attack to be launched. He demanded that eight of the nine Panzer Divisions in Normandy be used in the attack, and that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; commit its entire reserve, including 1,000 fighter aircraft. According to Hitler, three qualifications had to be met for the attack to proceed. &quot;Von Kluge must believe in it. He must be able to detach enough armour from the main front in Normandy to create an effective striking force, and he must achieve surprise&quot;.

Although ordered to wait &quot;until every tank, gun and plane was assembled&quot;, Kluge and SS General Paul Hausser (commanding the German 7th Army, which held the western part of the front) decided to attack as soon as possible, before the overall situation deteriorated further. The main striking force assigned was the XLVII Panzer Corps, commanded by General Hans Freiherr von Funck. Instead of eight Panzer Divisions, only four—one of them incomplete—could be relieved from their defensive tasks and assembled in time; the 2nd Panzer Division, 116th Panzer Division, the 2nd SS Panzer Division and part of the 1st SS Panzer Division, with a total of about 300 tanks. The Panzer Corps was supported by two Infantry Divisions and five &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot;, formed from the remnants of the &quot;Panzer Lehr&quot; Division and four equally battered infantry divisions.

Kluge ordered the attack to be mounted on the night of 6/7 August. To avoid alerting American forces to the attack, there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.

==German attacks==
At 22:00 on 6 August, von Funck reported that his troops were still not concentrated, and the commander of the 116th Panzer Division &quot;had made a mess of things&quot;. In fact, this officer (Gerhard von Schwerin) had been so pessimistic about the operation that he had not even ordered his tank units to take part. This delay disjointed the German attack, but on the German left flank, the SS Panzer troops attacked the positions of the American 30th Infantry Division east of Mortain shortly after midnight. The Germans achieved temporary surprise, as the Ultra documents had arrived at U.S. First Army Headquarters too late to alert the troops to the immediate assault. They briefly captured Mortain but were unable to breach the lines of the 30th Division, as the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Infantry Regiment commanded Hill 314, the dominant feature around Mortain. Although cut off, they were supplied by parachute drops. Of the 700 men who defended the position until 12 August, over 300 were killed or wounded.

To the north, the 2nd Panzer Division attacked several hours later, aiming south-west toward Avranches. It managed to penetrate several miles into the American lines, before being stopped by the 35th Infantry Division and a combat command of the 3rd Armored Division only short of Avranches. The German High Command ordered the attacks to be renewed before the afternoon, so that Avranches could be taken.

===Allied air strikes—the offensive stalls===
By noon of 7 August, the early morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied aircraft appeared over the battlefield. With the advance knowledge of the attack provided by Ultra, the U.S. 9th Air Force had been reinforced by the RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Despite assurances by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved complete control of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft from the moment they took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield. In the open ground east of Mortain, the German &quot;Panzers&quot; became exposed targets, especially for rocket-firing Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers of the RAF. The RAF Typhoon, which was selected by General Eisenhower to attack the armoured divisions, carried eight 60 lb rockets which had the destructive power of a 6-inch naval gun shell and even with a 40-50 yard error they were extremely destructive especially when fired in salvo. Typhoons flew 294 sorties that afternoon, firing 2,088 rockets and dropping 80 short tons (73 t) of bombs. They engaged the German formations while the US 9th Air Force prevented German fighters from intervening. General Speidel, Chief of Staff to Field-Marshal Von Kluge, wrote after the war &quot;The armoured operation was completely wrecked exclusively by the Allied Air Forces supported by a highly trained ground wireless organization&quot;. Author and Typhoon pilot, Desmond Scott states that the battle of Mortain &quot;proved conclusively that major ground offensives can be defeated by the use of tactical air power alone&quot;. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, said of the Typhoons; &quot;The chief credit in smashing the enemy&#x27;s spearhead, however, must go to the rocket-firing Typhoon aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force ..The result of the strafing was that the enemy attack was effectively brought to a halt, and a threat was turned into a great victory.&quot;

Allied fighter bomber attacks in the Battle of Mortain produced claims of the pilots of over two hundred German tanks destroyed. This was disputed by subsequent Army studies of the battlefield, which showed that most of the destroyed German armor was knocked out by gunfire from ground forces and that the main effect of the Allied air attacks had been to destroy the unarmored vehicles and troops in the German offensive, as well as forcing the German armor to disperse to cover (thus disrupting its operations). The rockets and bombs of the Allied fighter-bombers were too poor to destroy more than a few of the German tanks, but fear of being incinerated inside a tank if a rocket or bomb struck it caused some of the inexperienced German crews to abandon their tanks intact under air attack. In one British study, it was found that the average Typhoon pilot firing a barrage of all eight rockets had only a four percent chance of striking a target the size of a tank.

==American counter-moves==
Through 7 August, American troops had continued to press south near Vire, on the right flank of the German attack. The 116th Panzer Division—which was supposed to advance in this sector—was actually driven back. In the afternoon, the 1st SS and 116th Panzer Divisions made renewed attacks, but the flanks of the Mortain positions had been sealed off, allowing the American VII Corps to contain the German advance.

Meanwhile, Bradley had sent two armoured combat commands against the German southern (left) flank. On 8 August, one of these (from the U.S. 2nd Armored Division) was attacking the rear of the two SS Panzer Divisions. Although fighting would continue around Mortain for several more days, there was no further prospect of any German success. The Germans issued orders to go on to the defensive along the entire front, but poorly communicated orders resulted in this being impossible to achieve, with some German forces retreating, and others preparing to hold their ground.

As the U.S. First Army counter-attacked German units near Mortain, units of Patton&#x27;s 3rd Army were advancing unchecked through the open country to the south of the German armies, and had taken Le Mans on 8 August. The same day, the First Canadian Army attacked the weakened German positions south of Caen in Operation Totalize and threatened to break through to Falaise, although this attack stalled after two days. In desperation, Hitler ordered the attacks against Mortain to be renewed with greater intensity, demanding that the 9th Panzer Division, almost the only formation opposing Patton&#x27;s advance east from Le Mans, be transferred to Mortain to take part in the attack. General Heinrich Eberbach—commander of &quot;Panzergruppe&quot; West—was ordered to form a new headquarters, named &quot;&quot;Panzer&quot; Group Eberbach&quot;, to command the renewed offensive. Kluge—who feared he was about to be implicated by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; in the 20 July Plot—acquiesced in this apparently suicidal order. Eberbach&#x27;s proposed counter-attack was soon overtaken by events, and was never mounted.

==Aftermath==
By 13 August, the offensive had fully halted, with German forces being driven out of Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, more than two-thirds of their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and &quot;Panzergruppe&quot; West in danger of being encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.

Although American casualties in Operation Lüttich were significantly lighter than in previous operations, certain sectors of the front, notably the positions held by the 30th Division around Mortain, took severe casualties. By the end of 7 August alone, nearly 1,000 men of the 30th Division had been killed. Estimates for American casualties from 6–13 August vary from 2,000-3,000 fatalities, with an unknown number of wounded.

On 14 August, Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable, in conjunction with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 German troops in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively putting an end to the German 7th Army.

<doc id="702856" wikidata="Q144114" url="?curid=702856" title="1810 Epimetheus">
<text>1810 Epimetheus , provisional designation , is a stony Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered on 24 September 1960, by Dutch astronomer couple Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten, and Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels during the Palomar–Leiden survey at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. It was later named after Epimetheus from Greek mythology.

== Classification and orbit ==

The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,211 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as the previous identifications, and , made at Johannesburg and Uccle in 1942 and 1950, respectively, remained unused.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Rotation period ===

Two divergent rotational lightcurves of &quot;Epimetheus&quot; were obtained from photometric observations. They gave a rotation period of 10.9 and 28.6 hours with both having a brightness variation of 0.04 magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Epimetheus&quot; measures 7.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.27, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of its orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6.

== Survey designation ==

The survey designation &quot;P-L&quot; stands for &quot;Palomar–Leiden&quot;, named after Palomar Observatory and Leiden Observatory, which collaborated on the fruitful Palomar–Leiden survey in the 1960s. Gehrels used Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (also known as the 48-inch Schmidt Telescope), and shipped the photographic plates to Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden Observatory where astrometry was carried out. The trio are credited with the discovery of several thousand minor planets.

== Naming ==

This minor planet is named for the Titan in Greek mythology, Epimetheus, who opened Pandora&#x27;s box, which contained all the illnesses and ailments of mankind &quot;(also see 55 Pandora)&quot;. &quot;Epimetheus&quot; is also a moon of Saturn, which was discovered by Voyager 1 in 1980. Epimetheus is the brother of Prometheus after whom the minor planet 1809 Prometheus was named. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1976 ().

<text>Resurrection Band, also known as Rez Band or REZ, was a Christian rock band formed in 1972. They were part of the Jesus People USA Christian community in Chicago and most of its members have continued in that community to this day. Known for their blend of blues-rock and hard rock, Resurrection Band is credited as one of the forerunners of the Christian metal genre. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; called them &quot;the most influential band in Christian music history.&quot; Following their debut in 1978, the band&#x27;s greatest popularity was during the early 1980s, but later in the decade they received some crossover success when they had two music videos featured on MTV.

Led by the husband-and-wife team of Glenn and Wendi Kaiser, the band sought to evangelize using Christian rock, and addressed a variety of social ills in the lyrics of their music. While the group is officially disbanded, they played several one-off dates at the now defunct Cornerstone Festival, which members of the band helped establish. Currently Glenn Kaiser has an established solo career as a blues musician and is also a speaker on various spiritual issues to youth and adults.

==Band history==

===The 1970s: Breaking new ground===
The band originally played together under the name &quot;Charity&quot; in 1972 with Jesus People Milwaukee, based in Milwaukee. When the community split into four groups, one became the &quot;Jesus People USA Traveling Team&quot;, working primarily in Florida. Before their relocation to Chicago, the name &quot;Resurrection Band&quot; was chosen and the band became a primary focus of the community&#x27;s ministry. After arriving in Chicago, the band recorded two independent cassettes that were given away after their concerts. The band performed anywhere they were allowed to play, from schools to prisons to street corners. The first cassette, &quot;Music to Raise the Dead&quot;, featured hard rock, while &quot;All Your Life&quot; comprised only their acoustic numbers. These were a reflection of the folk-oriented sets they would play at more conservative venues such as nursing homes and churches. The churches were deeply sceptical of Christian rock, especially the borderline heavy metal that Resurrection Band specialized in.

Four years later, thanks to an $8000 gift from a friend, Resurrection Band recorded their first album, &quot;Awaiting Your Reply&quot;, over a two-week period of marathon all-night sessions. Although the band had completed the album, including the cover art, no Christian record label would risk releasing it, as the Led Zeppelin/Jefferson Airplane inspired music was considered much too controversial for the Christian market at that time. Star Song Records were warned away from the project by other gospel music executives, but the tiny label had nothing to lose so they signed the band and released the record as it was. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, &quot;Awaiting Your Reply&quot; hit big in the Christian market, and reached No. 6 on the Gospel album sales charts. Although misunderstood by many critics at the time, the album has been re-evaluated and highly praised in recent years and is listed at No. 91 in the book, &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot;, released in 2001.

The band followed up the success of that album with &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot;, which continued in the same progressive hard rock/metal vein akin to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith. Although the band was pleased with the effort, Star Song was not, and the band was forced to find another label shortly after its release. &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; is significant for being the first album by an American rock band to address the racist system of apartheid in South Africa, a full year before Peter Gabriel brought the issue to the world&#x27;s attention with his classic song &quot;Biko.&quot; Resurrection Band would eventually become known for grappling with a variety of social and political ills in its music, from the evils of the military-industrial complex to the corrupting influence of American materialism, racism, homelessness, AIDS, drug addiction, prostitution and many other issues that the band personally confronted in its ministry to their surrounding urban community in Chicago.

===1980-1982: Acceptance and critical respect===
Once signed by Light Records, Resurrection Band shed its progressive rock leanings and went for a more radio-friendly hard rock/metal sound. Both &quot;Colours&quot;, released in 1980, and &quot;Mommy Don&#x27;t Love Daddy Anymore&quot;, released in 1981, were solid collections of music that alternately addressed larger social issues such as poverty and divorce as well as personal spiritual issues of salvation and discipleship, along with the intersection between the two. While the mainstream Christian press was still adapting to the idea of Christian hard rock, both albums were highly praised by alternative Christian music newspapers and their leading publication &quot;Harvest Rock Syndicate&quot; awarded both five stars. In addition, Resurrection Band began receiving greater airplay on radio stations that played Christian rock. Combined with their reputation as a powerful live act and effective evangelistic ministry (thanks to the fiery sermons preached at the end of Resurrection Band concerts by Glenn Kaiser), the band gained a positive reputation among church youth leaders as well as an enthusiastic and devoted fanbase. In spite of the increased attention, Resurrection Band funneled any and all profits back into the Jesus People USA community, as members held all monies in common according to the example set by the New Testament church.

In an attempt to be more efficient stewards of those monies, Resurrection Band built their own recording studio in the heart of their community, later nicknamed &quot;Tone Zone.&quot; Although put together on a shoestring budget (with old mattresses on the walls in the studio&#x27;s early incarnation), it was there that the band recorded its next album, &quot;D.M.Z.&quot;, during the summer of 1982. A transitional work, the album was half Van Halen-inspired hard rock featuring blistering guitar solos from Stu Heiss, while the other half took a much more new wave-driven approach, a controversial musical direction the band would pursue with greater vigor on future releases. The split personality of the album was not well-received critically, although it generated two tracks that became live staples for years to come: &quot;Military Man&quot; and &quot;White Noise.&quot;

To that end, those songs appeared again on the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Live Bootleg&quot;, a live album recorded before an enthusiastic local audience at the Odeum in Villa Park, IL in October 1983. This was the band&#x27;s first release for Sparrow Records, one of the largest and most successful Christian record labels, which at that time was seeking to sign more Christian musical acts with ministry as their primary focus. &quot;Live Bootleg&quot; was the first album to be released under the band&#x27;s shortened moniker &quot;Rez Band,&quot; a colloquialism created by fans, and it also featured a number of songs that directly addressed issues of concern to high school-aged listeners. The latter focus would continue for as long as the band recorded music.

===The mid-1980s: From New Wave to MTV===

After a number of successful tours throughout the United States and Europe in the early 1980s with a variety of Christian hard rock acts—including a high-profile tour in 1982 with Swedish quartet Jerusalem—Rez Band was viewed by both fans and music critics as the preeminent Christian hard rock band. Capitalizing on the tour&#x27;s success the live album Live Bootleg (Resurrection Band album) was recorded in the fall of 1983 and released in 1984 and is the band&#x27;s biggest selling album and features a mixture of the band&#x27;s most popular live tracks as well as two new hard driving songs: &quot;Gameroom&quot; and &quot;Playground&quot;. As a result, when Rez Band released &quot;Hostage&quot; in late 1984, listeners were caught completely off guard. Moderately keyboard-driven, the album reflected the band&#x27;s increasing interest in New Wave music with the first single &quot;S.O.S.&quot; featuring almost no guitar whatsoever (although it does feature a Speak &amp; Spell). &quot;S.O.S.&quot; shot to the top of the Christian rock singles chart, staying there for several weeks and in doing so, the band attracted an entirely new audience. Still, the move was controversial and the critical reaction highly divided.

Rez Band had not completely abandoned its hard rock sound, though. The next single, &quot;Crimes&quot; - sung by co-lead singer Wendi Kaiser - is a traditional headbanging Rez Band number about inner-city violence, a topic that band members and the Jesus People USA community know first-hand. &quot;Crimes&quot; was even more popular on Christian radio, and received airplay on some mainstream rock stations as well, thanks to its music video, one of the first from the Contemporary Christian music industry to be broadcast on MTV.

That brief taste of mainstream success had a major influence on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Between Heaven &#x27;N Hell&quot;, which jettisoned most of the New Wave stylings of &quot;Hostage&quot; in favor of radio-friendly hard rock more akin to their &quot;Colours&quot; period. Shortening their moniker even further to &quot;REZ,&quot; the band took advantage of the fact that Capitol Records now handled Sparrow&#x27;s distribution. While the lyrics on the album represent a strong Christian worldview, explicit references to God or Jesus were almost non-existent. The catchy &quot;Love Comes Down&quot; was chosen as the band&#x27;s first single and the music video - featuring much dance choreography - was a far more polished effort and as a result, received far more airplay on MTV than &quot;Crimes&quot; ever did. There was some controversy concerning this particular song as the guitar riff is almost exactly the same as AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie.&quot; However, the band&#x27;s most controversial decision was to eliminate the traditional altar call at the end of their concerts as a concession to playing more secular venues for the tour that supported this album, leading some to accuse the band of selling out their message for greater mainstream acceptance.

===1988-1993: Incorporating the blues===
It would be three years before REZ returned to the studio to record their next album and much changed in the Contemporary Christian music industry during that time. REZ was no longer the dominant force in Christian rock; instead, Stryper had burst onto the scene in all their yellow-and-black glory, bringing Christian metal to the mainstream with &quot;To Hell with the Devil&quot; in 1986, which sold millions of albums and made the band a mainstay on MTV. Amy Grant had scored her first No. 1 US pop hit the same year with &quot;The Next Time I Fall,&quot; a duet with former Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera. Even Christian alternative music had made inroads into the mainstream when The 77s signed with Island Records and their self-titled album received a favorable review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In addition, the Jesus People USA community established the annual Cornerstone Festival during this period, which would serve as a springboard to mainstream success for future Christian artists like Sixpence None the Richer and P.O.D.

Even the lineup of REZ changed during this time as well. Bassist Jim Denton left to attend theological seminary and was replaced by long-time REZ roadie and songwriter Roy Montroy, who would soon become a major creative force in the band.

Although REZ had been left out of the mainstream success which arguably the band had spearheaded for others, REZ was nevertheless more interested in using its music to speak plainly to both non-Christians about the reality of God and to Christians about their responsibility to the disenfranchised and hurting in the world around them. To that end, REZ returned to the studio in 1988, and the result was &quot;Silence Screams&quot;, a hybrid of blues, hard rock and heavy metal that served as a musical blueprint for all of the band&#x27;s successive releases. Sporting unsettling cover art, &quot;Silence Screams&quot; deals forcefully with social concerns such as abortion, greed, racial profiling and even terrorism, proving that—as they did with confronting apartheid in 1979—the band was once again ahead of the curve. The album is also unique in that it is the first to have been released on the band&#x27;s own record label, Grrr Records, a wordplay on Myrrh Records, the most successful Contemporary Christian record label at that time. Now, the band could exercise complete creative and financial control over their music.

Creatively invigorated, REZ released a new studio album every 18 months on average. &quot;Innocent Blood&quot;, &quot;Civil Rites&quot; and &quot;Reach of Love&quot; continued the formula first begun on &quot;Silence Screams&quot;. Each album dealt with current topics of social and spiritual concern, and each release contained more and more blues influence, thanks to lead singer Glenn Kaiser, who was beginning a new career as a blues artist outside of REZ. With Kaiser focusing more of his attention on his solo work, Roy Montroy became a greater contributor to REZ, and for &quot;Reach of Love&quot;, he wrote every single track, a feat never accomplished before by any member of the band. However, there was a growing sense - not just among music critics but also within the band itself - that the formula was growing stale and that REZ had fallen into a creative rut. As a result, for the first time in the band&#x27;s history, REZ reached outside the Jesus People USA community for creative inspiration. It came in the form of Ty Tabor, guitarist and co-lead singer of King&#x27;s X.

===The late 1990s: Creative reinvention===
The result of Ty Tabor&#x27;s influence was &quot;Lament&quot;, released in 1995. Unlike any of the band&#x27;s previous work, &quot;Lament&quot; is the band&#x27;s first concept album, a song cycle about one man&#x27;s disillusionment with the harshness and cruelty of life and his growing realization that things cannot change unless he experiences spiritual redemption. Recognizing the importance of how the songs are ordered, Resurrection Band (which had now reverted to its original moniker) played the entire album from beginning to end on the tour which supported this album. This was rare enough in rock music—save for The Who and Styx—but unheard of in Christian rock. As a result, the creative rebirth of &quot;Lament&quot; was highly praised among long-time fans of Resurrection Band as well as prominent Christian music critics, with some calling the album the finest the band ever recorded.

Despite the praise the band received for &quot;Lament&quot;, Resurrection Band called it quits at the end of the tour; however, it would play an annual live set at the Cornerstone Festival, which had become one of the Christian music industry&#x27;s pre-eminent events. Then, in 1997, the band returned to the studio for one last recording. The MTV Unplugged craze was at its highest pitch, and Resurrection Band felt it was an appropriate time to reinvent some of its hard rock material in an acoustic format. The result was &quot;Ampendectomy&quot;, featuring 15 selections pulled from the band&#x27;s history. The reviews of the album were mixed.

===2000 and beyond===
In July 2000, Resurrection Band brought almost 30 years of music and ministry to a close with a farewell performance, leaving behind them a transformed Christian music industry, and a platform upon which future Christian musicians could build.

In July 2008, the group reunited for the 25th anniversary of Cornerstone Festival. That same year, Grrr Records released &quot;Music to Raise the Dead 1972-1998&quot;; three CDs with 52 re-mastered songs, an 80-page full-color booklet detailing the history of Rez Band with scores of photos, and one DVD with over an hour of previously unreleased live concert video footage and special features.

In April 2010, the group reunited once again for the annual Easterfest Christian music festival in Toowoomba, Australia.

<text>The U.S. state of Arizona&#x27;s State Routes are usually abbreviated as SR.

==History==
The Arizona State Highway system was introduced on September 9, 1927, by the State Highway Commission (formed on August 11 of the same year). It incorporated the new federal aid system and also the U.S. Highway system. The 1927 plan included 27 state routes, most of which were simply dirt roads. Until 1942, the state route marker signs contained a Native American swastika that were used by Navajos, but were removed after the U.S.&#x27;s entry into World War II against Nazi Germany which had a reversed swastika as its emblem and became strongly negatively associated with the Nazis.

The modern system was introduced and adopted in the 1950s.

==Designations and nomenclatures==
The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) internally recognizes Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways and Arizona Highways as all being separate types of highway designations. State highways within Arizona are referred to as Arizona State Routes or State Routes, with the prefix &quot;SR&quot; being used for abbreviations. ADOT also recognizes seven different types of suffixed routes for the U.S. Highways and State Routes. The recognized suffixes consist of the following with &quot;(Number)&quot; filling in for a numeric designation:
*Alternate (A) – Referred to as &quot;State Route (Number)A&quot; and abbreviated as &quot;SR (Number)A&quot;.
*Business Route (B) – Referred to as &quot;State Business Route (Number)&quot; and abbreviated as &quot;SR (Number)B&quot; or &quot;SR (Number) Bus.&quot;.
*Loop Route (L) – Referred to as &quot;State Loop Route (Number)&quot; and abbreviated as &quot;SR (Number)L&quot;. Despite often having &quot;Loop&quot; within their titles, SR 101, SR 202 and SR 303 are not considered &quot;Loop Routes&quot; by ADOT, nor are Interstate Business Loops. To date, SR 89L has been the only Loop Route recognized by ADOT.
*Spur (S) – Referred to as &quot;State Route (Number) Spur&quot; and abbreviated as &quot;SR (Number)S&quot; or &quot;SR (Number) Spur&quot;.
*Truck (T) - Referred to as &quot;State Route (Number) Truck&quot; and abbreviated as &quot;SR (Number) Truck&quot;.
*Temporary (X) - Publicly referred to as &quot;State Route (Number) Temporary&quot; or &quot;State Route (Number)T&quot; and abbreviated &quot;SR (Number)T&quot;. Internally referred to as &quot;State Route (Number)X&quot; and abbreviated &quot;SR (Number)X&quot;.
*Wye Leg (Y) - Referred to as &quot;State Route (Number)Y&quot; and abbreviated &quot;SR (Number)Y&quot;.

U.S. Highways can also use the same suffixes listed above. Usually the suffixed routes are recognized by ADOT as U.S. Highways. For example, the Alternate route of U.S. Route 89 (US 89) is referred to as U.S. Route 89A (US 89A) instead of State Route 89A (SR 89A). The only exception to this rule is SR 93X, which is a suffixed route of US 93. Suffixed routes for Interstates are a different story. Although the suffixed routes are signed with Interstate green Business shields, they are recognized by ADOT as suffixed State Routes. In the field, Interstate 10 business routes are signed as Interstate 10 Business Loop or Interstate 10 Business Spur, while they are referred to by ADOT as &quot;State Business Route 10&quot; (SR 10B) and &quot;State Route 10 Spur&quot; (SR 10 Spur). The same principle applies with business routes for all other Interstates in Arizona.

Designations listed under Highway Logs and GIS data however, use the Arizona Transportation Information System (ATIS) nomenclature. The ATIS designation for a non-suffixed state route is &quot;S (Number)&quot;. The number at the end is always three digits long. As such, all two digit routes are referred to under the ATIS terminology as &quot;S 0(Number)&quot;. SR 260 and SR 79 are known under ATIS nomenclature as &quot;S 260&quot; and &quot;S 079&quot; respectively. U.S. Highways replace the prefix &quot;S&quot; used by State Routes under the ATIS nomenclature with &quot;U&quot; while Interstate Highways use the prefix &quot;I&quot;. Suffixed routes under ATIS always have the internally applied suffix between the prefix. State Business Route 79 under ATIS nomenclature is referred to as &quot;SB079&quot; and SR 93X is &quot;SX093&quot;.

<text>In graph theory, a subcoloring is an assignment of colors to a graph&#x27;s vertices such that each color class induces a vertex disjoint union of cliques. That is, each color class should form a cluster graph.

The subchromatic number χS(&quot;G&quot;) of a graph &quot;G&quot; is the fewest colors needed in any subcoloring of &quot;G&quot;.

Subcoloring and subchromatic number were introduced by .

Every proper coloring and cocoloring of a graph are also subcolorings, so the subchromatic number of any graph is at most equal to the cochromatic number, which is at most equal to the chromatic number.

Subcoloring is as difficult to solve exactly as coloring, in the sense that (like coloring) it is NP-complete. More specifically,
the problem of determining whether a planar graph has subchromatic number at most 2 is NP-complete, even if it is a
* triangle-free graph with maximum degree 4 ,
* comparability graph with maximum degree 4 ,
* line graph of a bipartite graph with maximum degree 4 ,
* graph with girth 5 .

The subchromatic number of a cograph can be computed in polynomial time . For every fixed integer r, it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether the subchromatic number of interval and permutation graphs is at most r .

<text>Francisco Mariano Quiñones Quiñones (1830 – 13 September 1908) was a proponent of the abolition of slavery and of the self-determination of Puerto Rico.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Quiñones was born into a wealthy family of landowners in San Germán, Puerto Rico, and at a young age developed his lifelong love for literature and journalism. He was sent to Europe where he attended private schools. After he finished his secondary education, he went on to university studies in Bremen, Germany; France, and New York City. When Quiñones returned to Puerto Rico in 1848, he went to work for the family business.

===Abolitionist===
In 1865, the Spanish Crown requested from the municipalities of Puerto Rico recommendations for new laws and Quiñones was elected representative for San Germán. In 1867, Quiñones represented Puerto Rico before the &quot;Overseas Information Committee&quot; meeting in Spain. Together with Segundo Ruiz Belvis and José Julián Acosta, he demanded the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and also protested over the injustices practiced by the governor General Romualdo Palacio González in the island.

===Politician===
When Quiñones returned to the island, he joined the Puerto Rican Liberal Reformist Party and in 1871 was elected as representative in front of the Spanish Courts. In Spain he continued his fight for the abolition of slavery.

In 1887, Quiñones joined the Autonomist Party headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera. There were some disagreements between Muñoz and some of the members which led to a rupture in the party. Among those who abandoned the party were Quiñones and José Celso Barbosa, who went on to form the Orthodox Autonomist Party.

On 10 February 1898, Spain granted Puerto Rico the rights to self-determination, which was considered the first step towards independence. Quiñones was named President of Puerto Rico&#x27;s first Cabinet by General Macías.

In 1898, after the Spanish–American War when Puerto Rico became a colonial territory of the United States, Quiñones joined the Puerto Rican Republican Party founded by Celso Barbosa and which championed the idea of converting Puerto Rico into a state of the U.S. Quiñones was elected and served as a representative in the House of Delegates in 1900 and 1902 Mayor of San Germán. On 13 September 1908, Quiñones died in San Germán and a private mourning the following day on the house floor was attended by Muñoz, José de Diego, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, R. Arrillaga, José R. Laurrauri, Pedro F. Colberg, Carlos H. Blondet, and V. Trelles Oliva; a public funeral was held at 7 P.M.

==Works==
Among his most important written works of literature are &quot;Artículos&quot; (1887) and &quot;Apuntes para la Historia de Puerto Rico&quot; (1888).

<doc id="702872" wikidata="Q2691759" url="?curid=702872" title="McKenzie River (Oregon)">
<text>The McKenzie River is a tributary of the Willamette River in western Oregon in the United States. It drains part of the Cascade Range east of Eugene and flows westward into the southernmost end of the Willamette Valley. It is named for Donald McKenzie, a Scottish Canadian fur trader who explored parts of the Pacific Northwest for the Pacific Fur Company in the early 19th century. As of the 21st century, six large dams have been built on the McKenzie and its tributaries.

==Course==
The McKenzie River originates as the outflow of Clear Lake in the high Cascades of eastern Linn County in the Willamette National Forest. (Clear Lake is fed by Ikenick Creek and Fish Lake Creek, the latter of which flows from Fish Lake. Fish Lake&#x27;s main tributary is Hackleman Creek, which drains the north side of Browder Ridge east of Tombstone Pass. U.S. Route 20 crosses the pass and follows Hackleman Creek.) The McKenzie River flows south from Clear Lake, paralleled by Oregon Route 126, and goes over the Sahalie and Koosah waterfalls to Carmen Reservoir, a man-made lake from which the river is then diverted into a tunnel to Smith Reservoir. Between Carmen Reservoir and Tamolitch Falls, the riverbed is dry for because lava from Belknap Crater buried that stretch of the river about 1,600 years ago. The river flows under the lava for those three miles and re-surfaces at Tamolitch Pool at the base of Tamolitch Falls. It then flows south into Trail Bridge Reservoir, where the Smith River enters from the right. After passing through Trail Bridge Dam, the river enters Lane County. The McKenzie continues south to Belknap Springs, where it turns west and flows past the community of McKenzie Bridge. It receives the South Fork McKenzie River about three miles east of Blue River. (The South Fork rises near the Pacific Crest Trail in the Three Sisters Wilderness and flows north-northwest for about through Cougar Reservoir and Cougar Dam.)

After the South Fork confluence, the main stem of the McKenzie River continues west through a narrow valley in the mountains, receiving the Blue River from the north at the community of Blue River. The McKenzie then passes Vida and continues to Leaburg and Walterville. The McKenzie valley widens as the river continues west, receiving the Mohawk River from the northeast just north of Springfield. Emerging from the Cascade foothills, the McKenzie enters a broad floodplain. It joins the Willamette River from the east north of Eugene.

==Watershed==
The McKenzie River drains a region of about and is one of the primary tributaries of the Willamette River. Elevations in the watershed range from at the summit of the South Sister to at the McKenzie&#x27;s mouth on the Willamette River north of Eugene. The upper basin, in the high Cascades, consists of granular, permeable igneous rocks that are geologically young, while most of the middle and lower McKenzie valley in the Western Cascades is made of the remnants of older, more weathered volcanic rocks. Major watersheds bordering the McKenzie basin include the Calapooia; the South, Middle and North Santiam rivers to the north; the Middle Fork Willamette River to the south; and the Deschutes River to the east.

Most of the watershed is lightly populated; about 70 percent of it is public land managed by the U.S. Government, of which about 39 percent is the Three Sisters Wilderness. Over 96 percent of the basin is forested, just under 4 percent is devoted to agricultural use—mainly farms and orchards on the lower floodplain—and the remainder is residential or industrial. Most of the public land is part of the Willamette National Forest and is important for logging and recreation. The river is the sole tap water source for the cities of Eugene and Springfield, fulfilling the water needs of about 200,000 people. The Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board (EWEB) utility draws the water at river mile (RM) 11 or river kilometer (RK) 18 in Springfield. Water quality in the river is rated good to excellent, with better quality upstream than downstream. Principal sources of contaminants in the McKenzie are agriculture and residential development, including septic systems. Small amounts of herbicides detected in the river and some of its tributaries may be from aerial spraying by timber companies for forestry.

The region has a temperate climate with wet winters and dry summers. About 90 percent of precipitation in the watershed comes between October and May. Precipitation in the basin varies greatly with elevation; about fall annually in the Willamette Valley, while the Three Sisters in the high Cascades can receive in a year. Above , about 35 percent of precipitation falls as snow, and at and higher, over 75 percent of precipitation is snowfall. At these elevations, melting snow beginning in the spring season brings more cold water out of springs under the permeable rock, increasing the McKenzie&#x27;s flow and maintaining cold water temperatures in the river and its tributaries. Along the lower McKenzie, however, winter rain slides easily off the less permeable rock and erodes sediment into the river.

===Engineering===
There are six major dams in the McKenzie River watershed—three on the river and three each on a different tributary of the McKenzie. The three dams on the McKenzie&#x27;s main stem form Carmen Reservoir, Trail Bridge Reservoir, and Leaburg Reservoir, respectively. The other dams in the watershed are the Smith River dam on the Smith River in the upper basin, Cougar Dam on the South Fork McKenzie River, and Blue River Dam on the Blue River. The Carmen Diversion Dam is the uppermost dam on the McKenzie, located less than south of Clear Lake, the McKenzie River&#x27;s source. Water from Carmen Reservoir is diverted southwest through a tunnel to Smith Reservoir on the Smith River. Through both the Smith River and another tunnel, water in Smith Reservoir moves south to the Carmen Power Plant, then into Trail Bridge Reservoir—which the McKenzie joins—and through the power-producing Trail Bridge Dam. The engineered system is called the Carmen–Smith Hydroelectric Project, and it has been used by the Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board since 1963 to generate electricity for EWEB customers. The system&#x27;s generating capacity is 114 megawatts (MW).

EWEB also owns and manages two power-producing canals farther downstream along the McKenzie River. The Walterville Canal, completed in 1910, and the Leaburg Canal, completed in 1930, each contain water diverted from the McKenzie to produce electricity. Most of the water is returned to the river after power production.

===Communities===
The eastern portion of Oregon Route 126 passes through the valley of the McKenzie River, closely following the river for much of its route. The stretch of the river from the edge of the Springfield metro area eastward to the Cascades is known as the McKenzie Valley. The following communities, listed west to east, are in the valley: Cedar Flat, Walterville, Deerhorn, Leaburg, Vida, Nimrod, Finn Rock, Blue River, Rainbow, McKenzie Bridge, and Belknap Springs.

==History==
For about 8,000 years, the McKenzie River has been home to Native Americans. In more recent history, Kalapuya and Molala tribes lived nomadically in the summer and spent winters in the lower valley. This way of life continued until the mid-19th century, when many natives died of disease or were relocated to reservations.

The first recorded exploration of the river occurred in the spring of 1812, when the Pacific Fur Company reached the McKenzie via the Willamette River, as part of a larger exploration led by Donald McKenzie. The company had established a post in 1811 at Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River for the Astor Expedition. McKenzie, the following spring, formed a party to explore the Willamette River. The party found a large tributary of the Willamette River and named it after McKenzie. However, much of the McKenzie River remained largely unvisited by white settlers and explorers until October 1853, when a group of Oregon Trail settlers became lost trying to cross the Cascades into the Willamette Valley via the Elliott Cutoff.

In 1910, travelers completed the first automobile crossing over McKenzie Pass. However, crossing along the river was limited to summer because winter conditions closed the pass. Year-round travel was not possible until 1960, with the completion of a road over Santiam Pass.

==Flora and fauna==

Fish in the McKenzie River and some of its tributaries include spring Chinook salmon, mountain whitefish, and bull, cutthroat and rainbow trout. Dippers, mergansers, bald eagles, ospreys, and various ducks feed on the fish. The threatened northern spotted owl inhabits dense forest on the west side of the upper McKenzie basin in Linn County.

Forests of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar cover the vast majority of the watershed.
==Recreation==

The McKenzie River is popular for boating—especially fishing, kayaking, and whitewater rafting. The McKenzie River dory (or drift boat), specifically designed for use in whitewater, was first developed on the Mckenzie in the 1940s; adaptations of this design quickly grew in popularity on other Western rivers such as the Rogue and the Colorado. Boating is also common on Blue River Reservoir and Cougar Reservoir. Hiking and mountain biking are popular activities on trails in the McKenzie watershed. Trails include the McKenzie River National Recreation Trail, which follows much of the upper McKenzie.

Most whitewater rafting takes place between Quartz Creek and Helfrich Boat launch. This segment is roughly nine miles long and has three rapids, Browns Hole, Mamma&#x27;s Pies, and Marten&#x27;s Rapid (Class III). There are also a couple of smaller surfer rapids that kayakers typically stop at.

<text>Carboxyhemoglobin (carboxyhaemoglobin BrE) (symbol COHb or HbCO) is a stable complex of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin (Hb) that forms in red blood cells upon contact with carbon monoxide. Carboxyhemoglobin is often mistaken for the compound formed by the combination of carbon dioxide (carboxyl) and hemoglobin, which is actually carbaminohemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin terminology emerged when carbon monoxide was known by its historic name, &quot;carbonic oxide&quot;, and evolved through Germanic and British English etymological influences; the preferred IUPAC nomenclature is carbonylhemoglobin.

The average non-smoker maintains a systemic carboxyhemoglobin level under 3% COHb whereas smokers approach 10% COHb. The biological threshold for carboxyhemoglobin tolerance is 15% COHb, meaning toxicity is consistently observed at levels in excess of this concentration. The FDA has previously set a threshold of 14% COHb in certain clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of carbon monoxide.

== Overview ==
The average red blood cell contains 250 million hemoglobin molecules. Hemoglobin contains a globin protein unit with four prosthetic heme groups (hence the name heme -o- globin); each heme is capable of reversibly binding with one gaseous molecule (oxygen, carbon monoxide, cyanide, etc.), therefore a typical red blood cell may carry up to one billion gas molecules. As the binding of carbon monoxide with hemoglobin is reversible, certain models have estimated that 20% of the carbon monoxide carried as carboxyhemoglobin may dissociate in remote tissues.

== Endogenous carbon monoxide production ==
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced through many enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. The most extensively studied pathway is the metabolism of heme by heme oxygenase which occurs throughout the body with significant activity in the spleen to facilitate hemoglobin breakdown during erythrocyte recycling. Therefore heme can both carry carbon monoxide in the case of carboxyhemoglobin, or, undergo enzymatic catabolism to generate carbon monoxide.

Carbon monoxide was characterized as a neurotransmitter in 1993 and has since been subcategorized as a gasotransmitter.

Most endogenously produced carbon monoxide is stored as carboxyhemoglobin. The gas primarily undergoes pulmonary excretion, however trace amounts may be oxidized to carbon dioxide by certain cytochromes, metabolized by resident microbiota, or excreted by transdermal diffusion.

==Affinity of hemoglobin for carbon monoxide==
Compared to oxygen, carbon monoxide binds with approximately 240 times greater affinity, however the affinity of carbon monoxide for hemoglobin varies both across species and within a species. In the 1950s, Esther Killick was among the first to recognize a difference in carbon monoxide affinity between adult and foetal blood, and a difference between humans and sheep. In humans, the Hb-Kirklareli mutation has a relative 80,000 times greater affinity for carbon monoxide than oxygen resulting in systemic carboxyhemoglobin reaching a sustained level of 16% COHb. Other human mutations have been described (see also: hemoglobin variants). Structural variations and mutations across other hemoproteins likewise affect carbon monoxide&#x27;s interaction with the heme prosthetic group as exemplified by Cytochrome P450 where certain forms of the CYP3A family is relatively less affected by the inhibitory effects of carbon monoxide.

Murinae species have a COHb half-life of 20 minutes compared to 300 minutes for a typical human (see ). As a result, the metabolic kinetics, blood saturation point, and tolerance for carbon monoxide exposure vary across species, potentially leading to data inconsistencies pertaining to the toxicology of carbon monoxide poisoning and pharmacology of low-dose therapeutic protocols.

Some deep-diving marine mammal species are known to contain concentrations of carbon monoxide in their blood that resembles levels seen in chronic cigarette smokers, which may provide benefits against hypoxia. Similarly, the elevated levels in smokers has been suggested to be a basis for the smoker&#x27;s paradox. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide and elevated carboxyhemoglobin, such as in smoking, results in erythremia. Furthermore, humans can acclimate to toxic levels of carbon monoxide based on findings reported by Esther Killick.

== History ==
A bright red skin complexion is commonly associated with elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels. Trace evidence for an endogenous presence of carbon monoxide dates back to Marcellus Donato circa 1570 who noted an unusually red complexion upon conducting an autopsy of victims who died from charcoal fumes in Mantua. Similar findings pertaining to red complexion later emerged as documented by Johann Jakob Wepfer in the 1600s, and M. Antoine Portal in the late 1700s.

Phlogiston theory is a trace origin for the first chemical explanations of endogenous carboxyhemoglobin exemplified by the work of Joseph Priestley in the eighteenth century who suspected phlogiston to be a cellular waste product carried by the blood of animals which was subsequently exhaled.

Thomas Beddoes, James Watt, Humphry Davy, James Lind, and many others investigated the therapeutic potential of inhaling factitious airs in the late eighteenth century (see also: Pneumatic Institution). Among the gases experimented with, hydrocarbonate had received significant attention. Hydrocarbonate is water gas generated by passing steam over coke, the process of which generates carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and some considered it contained phlogiston. Beddoes and Watt recognized hydrocarbonate brightened venous blood in 1793. Watt suggested coal fumes could act as an antidote to the oxygen in blood, and Beddoes and Watt likewise speculated hydrocarbonate has a greater affinity for animal fiber than oxygen in 1796.

After the discovery of carbon monoxide by William Cruickshank in 1800, Johann Dömling (1803) and John Bostock (1804) developed hypotheses suggesting blood returned to the heart loaded with carbon monoxide to subsequently be oxidized to carbon dioxide in the lung prior to exhalation. Later in 1854, Adrien Chenot similarly suggested carbon monoxide could remove oxygen from blood and be oxidized within the body to carbon dioxide. The mechanism for carbon monoxide poisoning in the context of carboxyhemoglobin formation is widely credited to Claude Bernard whose memoirs beginning in 1846 and published in 1857 notably phrased, &quot;prevents arterials blood from becoming venous&quot;. Felix Hoppe-Seyler independently published similar conclusions in the following year.

The first analytical method to detect carboxyhemoglobin emerged in 1858 with a colorimetric method developed by Felix Hoppe-Seyler, and the first quantitative analysis method emerged in 1880 with Josef von Fodor.

=== Etymology ===
Carbon is derived from the Latin term &quot;carbo&quot;, meaning coal, via the French , which first appeared in print in 1786. The etymology of oxygen is generally accepted to mean &#x27;acid&#x27; based on Lavoisier&#x27;s system, which also recognized carbon as a nonmetallic element capable of oxidation, although the original degrees of oxides were based on diamond, graphite, coal and carbonic acid () as the most oxidized form; Lavoisier&#x27;s system was superseded by other obsolete oxide nomenclature systems.

Upon discovering carbon monoxide through a series of experiments originating from coke (short for coal-cake), Cruickshank named the new molecule &quot;gaseous oxide of carbon&quot; which evolved to &quot;carbonic oxide&quot; and was translated into German as &quot;kohlenoxyd&quot;. Kohlen is the German word for coal. As carbonic acid () was considered to be the most highly oxidized form in Lavoisier&#x27;s system, the name carbonic oxide implied an intermediate oxidized species between coal and carbonic acid (i.e. use of the word acid indicated maximum oxidation).

Haem is derived from Greek meaning blood, and globin is Latin derived from &quot;globus&quot; typically accepted to mean glob/spherical/round object; the terms are conjoined with an -o- . Regarding haem, the use of &quot;ae / æ&quot; remains prevalent in British English in modern day whereas the American English spelling evolved to heme from hema.

Felix Hoppe-Seyler coined the name &quot;hämoglobin&quot; in 1864. In German, an umlaut such as ä is synonymous with spelling as &quot;ae&quot;, therefore hämoglobin is commonly spelled as haemoglobin throughout German literature, hence haemoglobin is the term adopted by English literature.

Hoppe-Seyler likewise coined the name Kohlenoxydhämoglobin which may have similarly been directly translated back into English as &quot;carbonic oxide hæmoglobin&quot;. The term carboxyhæmoglobin appeared as early as 1895 in works by John Haldane while the name for CO was still widely regarded as carbonic oxide.

The term &quot;carbon monoxide&quot; was formally introduced in 1879, but the name would not become mainstream for several decades. Variations of COHb terminology, such as carbonmonoxyhemoglobin, followed and eventually evolved and simplified back into &quot;carboxyhemoglobin&quot;.

As carboxy is now firmly associated with the CO2 carboxyl group, and carbon monoxide is generally regarded as a carbonyl, IUPAC has recommended &quot;carbonylhemoglobin&quot; as the preferred COHb nomenclature. Despite the IUPAC guidance, carboxyhemoglobin remains the most widely used term (akin to the survival of bicarbonate nomenclature).

== Analytical detection methods ==
Historically, carboxyhemoglobin detection has been achieved by colorimetric analysis, chemical reactivity, spectrophotometry, gasometric and thermoelectric detection methods. Gas chromatography analysis emerged in 1961 and remains a commonly used method.

Modern methods include pulse oximetry with a CO-oximeter, and a variety of other analytical techniques. Most methods require laboratory equipment, skilled technicians, or expensive electronics therefore rapid and economical detection technologies remain in development.

Breath carbon monoxide is another detection method that may correlate with carboxyhemoglobin levels.

== Carbon monoxide poisoning ==

Carbon monoxide poisoning, also known as carboxyhemoglobinemia, has plagued humankind since primitive ancestors first harnessed fire. In modern times, carboxyhemoglobin data assist physicians in making a poisoning diagnosis. However, carboxyhemoglobin levels do not necessarily correlate with the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. In general, 30% COHb is considered severe carbon monoxide poisoning. The highest reported non-fatal carboxyhemoglobin level was 73% COHb.

=== Mode of toxic action ===
Gas exchange is an essential process for many organisms to maintain homeostasis. Oxygen accounts for about 20% of Earth&#x27;s atmospheric air. While inhaling air is critical to supply cells with oxygen for aerobic respiration via the Bohr effect and Haldane effect (and perhaps local low oxygen partial pressure e.g. active muscles), exhaling the cellular waste product carbon dioxide is arguably the more critical aspect of respiration. Whereas the body can tolerate brief periods of hypoxia (as commonly occurs in anaerobic exercise, although the brain, heart, liver and kidney are significantly less tolerant than skeletal muscle), failure to expel carbon dioxide may cause respiratory acidosis (meaning bodily fluids and blood become too acidic thereby affecting homeostasis). In absence of oxygen, cells switch to anaerobic respiration which if prolonged may significantly increase lactic acid leading to metabolic acidosis.

To provide a simplified synopsis of the molecular mechanism of systemic gas exchange, upon inhalation of air it was widely thought oxygen binding to any of the heme sites triggers a conformational change in the protein unit of hemoglobin which then enables the binding of additional oxygen to each of the other heme sites. Upon arrival to the cellular region, oxygen is released at the tissue due to a conformational change in hemoglobin as caused by ionization of hemoglobin&#x27;s surface due to the &quot;acidification&quot; of the tissue&#x27;s local pH (meaning a relatively higher concentration of &#x27;acidic&#x27; protons / hydrogen ions annotated as H+; an acidic pH is commonly referenced to as either low pH based on the acidity of pH 1-7 having a &quot;low&quot; number, or, referred to as a high pH due to the &quot;high&quot; concentration of H+ ions as the scale approaches pH 1); the local acidity is caused by an increase in the biotransformation of carbon dioxide waste into carbonic acid via carbonic anhydrase. In other words, oxygenated arterial blood arrives to cells in the &quot;hemoglobin R-state&quot; which has deprotonated/unionized amino acid residues (regarding hemoglobin&#x27;s amines transitioning between the deprotonated/unionized Hb-NH2 to the protonated/ionized Hb-NH3+ state) based on the less-acidic pH (arterial blood averages pH 7.407 whereas venous blood is slightly more acidic at pH 7.371). The &quot;T-state&quot; of hemoglobin is deoxygenated in venous blood partially due to protonation/ionization as caused by the acidic environment hence causing a conformation unsuited for oxygen-binding (i.e. oxygen is &#x27;ejected&#x27; upon arrival at the cell due to H+ ions bombarding the hemoglobin surface residues to convert Hb from &quot;R-state&quot; to &quot;T-state&quot;). Furthermore, the mechanism for formation of carbaminohemoglobin generates additional H+ ions that may further stabilize the protonated/ionized deoxygenated hemoglobin. Upon return of venous blood into the lung and subsequent exhalation of carbon dioxide, the blood is &quot;de-acidified&quot; (see also: hyperventilation) for the deprotonation/unionization of hemoglobin to re-enable oxygen binding as part of the transition to arterial blood (note this process is complex due to involvement of chemoreceptors, pH buffers and other physiochemical functionalities). Carbon monoxide poisoning disturbs this physiological process hence the venous blood of poisoning patients is bright red akin to arterial blood since the carbonyl/carbon monoxide is retained, whereas deoxygenated hemoglobin is dark red and carbaminohemoglobin has a blue hue.

At toxic concentrations, carbon monoxide as carboxyhemoglobin significantly interferes with respiration and gas exchange by simultaneously inhibiting acquisition and delivery of oxygen to cells, and preventing formation of carbaminohemoglobin which accounts for approximately 30% of carbon dioxide exportation. Therefore a patient suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning may experience severe hypoxia and acidosis in addition to the toxicities of excess carbon monoxide binding to numerous hemoproteins, metallic and non-metallic targets which affect cellular machinery (such as inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase).

=== Toxicokinetics ===
In common air under normal atmospheric conditions, a typical patient&#x27;s carboxyhemoglobin has a half-life around 300 minutes. This time can be reduced to 90 minutes upon administration of high-flow pure oxygen, and the time is further reduced when oxygen is administered with 5% carbon dioxide as first identified by Esther Killick. Additionally, treatment in a hyperbaric chamber is a more effective manner of reducing the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin to 30 minutes and allows oxygen to dissolve in biological fluids for delivery to tissues.

Supplemental oxygen takes advantage of Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle to quicken the decomposition of carboxyhemoglobin back to hemoglobin:

:HbCO + O2 ⇌ Hb + CO + O2 ⇌ HbO2 + CO

==Carboxyhemoglobin pharmaceuticals==

As carbon monoxide is now understood to have a therapeutic potential, pharmaceutical efforts have focused on development of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules and selective heme oxygenase inducers.

An alternative method for drug delivery consists of carbon monoxide immobilized on bovine carboxyhemoglobin which is currently in late clinical development. Similarly, maleimide PEG conjugated human carboxyhemoglobin had previously been the subject of pharmaceutical development.

<text>AP5 (also known as APV, (2&quot;R&quot;)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, or (2&quot;R&quot;)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) is a chemical compound used as a biochemical tool to study various cellular processes. It is a selective NMDA receptor antagonist that competitively inhibits the ligand (glutamate) binding site of NMDA receptors. AP5 blocks NMDA receptors in micromolar concentrations (~50 μM).

AP5 blocks the cellular analog of classical conditioning in the sea slug &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, and has similar effects on &quot;Aplysia&quot; long-term potentiation (LTP), since NMDA receptors are required for both. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the calcium chelator BAPTA to determine whether NMDARs are required for a particular cellular process. AP5/APV has also been used to study NMDAR-dependent LTP in the mammalian hippocampus.

In general, AP5 is very fast-acting within &quot;in vitro&quot; preparations, and can block NMDA receptor action at a reasonably small concentration. The active isomer of AP5 is considered to be the configuration, although many preparations are available as a racemic mixture of - and -isomers. It is useful to isolate the action of other glutamate receptors in the brain, i.e., AMPA and kainate receptors.

AP5 can block the conversion of a silent synapse to an active one, since this conversion is NMDA receptor-dependent.

<doc id="702899" wikidata="Q2336788" url="?curid=702899" title="Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe">
<text>The Sikorsky CH-54 Tarhe is an American twin-engine heavy-lift helicopter designed by Sikorsky Aircraft for the United States Army. It is named after Tarhe, an 18th-century chief of the Wyandot Indian tribe whose nickname was &quot;The Crane&quot;. The civilian version is the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane.

== Development ==

Work on what would become the CH-54 can be traced back to Sikorsky&#x27;s earlier activities with &quot;sky-crane&quot; helicopters, particularly the piston-engined Sikorsky S-60 of the late 1950s. Following the end of the Korean War, the United States Army sought to procure a successor to the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave, an early piston-engined heavy lift helicopter; being aware of this need, Sikorsky were keen to fulfill it. The company was already working on the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, a civil-orientated heavy lift rotorcraft that was designed specifically for the purpose of carrying large payloads externally; the development of a military-configured derivative was viewed as a natural option. While Sikorsky were quick to recognise the advantages of adopting turboshaft propulsion, there were no suitable engines of that type initially available, thus it had to work with the American engine manufacturer Pratt and Whitney to modify their JT12 turbojet to produce one.

One innovative feature for any helicopter of the era was the incorporation of an automatic flight control system, effectively a fly-by-wire arrangement. This feature enabled the aft-facing crew member to control the rotorcraft&#x27;s pitch, roll, and yaw with 10% control authority, along with an altitude-hold function; it was also praised for being relatively easy to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR). Considerable attention was paid to the fuselage&#x27;s design, particularly to minimising weight and maintenance requirements. The landing gear was designed to kneel to make loading easier as well as to ease operations from sloped surfaces. From on onset, Sikorsky sought to enable the type to carry as diverse a range of cargoes as possible, leading to the incorporation of fitting for the carriage of barges and of a specially-designed multipurpose &quot;people pod&quot; that was suited for use for personnel transport, paratroop operations, and even as a mobile hospital or mobile command post.

On 9 May 1962, the first of three prototypes performed its maiden flight. It was subsequently tested by the US Army at Fort Benning while the other two underwent an evaluation in West Germany. During June 1963, it was announced that the US Army had placed an order for an initial six helicopters, designating it as the &quot;CH-54A&quot;; the first of these was officially accepted on 30 June 1963. Following a relatively brief period of testing and evaluation, the CH-54 was quickly put into active use in Vietnam.

Early on, the type had demonstrated itself to possess unrivalled performance in some aspects. , it continues to hold the helicopter record for highest altitude in level flight at , which it set in 1971, as well at the fastest climb to 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 m (10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 ft). On 20 April 1965, a CH-54A equipped with a people pod lifted 90 people, comprising its crew of three and 87 combat-equipped troops; this was the largest number of people to be lifted by a single helicopter at that time.

==Operational history==
The United States Army would ultimately procure 105 examples, which it operated under the designation of &quot;CH-54 Tarhe&quot;. It was most prolifically used during the Vietnam War, typically to provide logistical support and heavy transport activities in aid of American ground troops. In the theater, CH-54s would routinely be used to reposition artillery pieces such as the M101 howitzer, and even airlift bulky payloads such as bulldozers and patrol boats. In terms of retrieved aircraft alone, in excess of 380 were reportedly recovered via CH-54, resulting in the saving of several hundred million dollars.

In particular, those forces operating in and around the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North Vietnam and South Vietnam were unable to rely on ground supply routes due to the unavoidable challenges posed by the local geography; instead, they were almost entirely dependent on air support provided by rotorcraft such as the CH-54. The type would operate so close to the frontlines that several would come under fire from the North Vietnamese. One unusual use of the type came under the &quot;Combat Trap&quot; programme, which saw it drop 10,000 lb bombs, intended for clearing landing zones. One danger that its crews had to maintain awareness of was the strong downwash generated by the rotors; nearby tents were particularly at risk of being blown away.

As a heavy transport helicopter, capable of retrieving numerous types of downed aircraft, it proved to be highly successful. The Tarhe can hold its cargo up and tight against its center spine to lessen drag and eliminate the pendulum effect when flying forward, as well as winch vehicles up and down from a hovering position, so the helicopter can deploy loads while hovering. Due to budget cuts, the Heavy Lift Helicopter (HLH) program was canceled and the CH-54 was not upgraded with larger engines. The relatively small fleet proved costly to maintain, thus the tandem-rotor Boeing CH-47 Chinook, a rival heavy lift helicopter, gradually supplemented the CH-54 for most transport duties, eventually replacing it in Regular Army aviation units during the 1980s. Another heavy lift helicopter, the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, had also been developed using many of the proven systems of the CH-54, including its engine, fuselage, and dynamic systems.

The CH-54 was also operated by the Army National Guard, where it performed a variety of military and civilian missions. It participated in various humanitarian relief operations, including the rescuing of a whale in Alaska. Unusual payloads include whole antenna towers and log cabins; another example was the use of a CH-54 to airlift air conditioners onto the roof of the Pentagon. Furthermore, it was commonly tasked with relocating non-airworthy or retired aircraft. Despite these atypical demands, the CH-54 achieved a strong safety record. The military cutbacks enacted at the end of the Cold War proved to be the death knell for the CH-54&#x27;s military service; the final National Guard flight was conducted on 10 January 1993.

Following their withdrawal from military use, many CH-54s were acquired by civilian operators and thus continued to be used in this new capacity. Of these, Erickson Air-Crane of Central Point, Oregon, operates the largest fleet of S-64 helicopters in the world under the name Erickson S-64 Aircrane. These can be equipped with water-dropping equipment (some also have foam/gel capability) for firefighting duties worldwide. After obtaining the type certificate and manufacturing rights in 1992, Erickson remains the manufacturer.

<doc id="702906" wikidata="Q1589368" url="?curid=702906" title="Boat-tailed grackle">
<text>The boat-tailed grackle (Quiscalus major) is a passerine bird of the family Icteridae found as a permanent resident on the coasts of the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States.

==Habitat==
The boat-tailed grackle is found in coastal saltwater marshes and, in Florida, also on inland waters. In salt marsh areas, least bitterns will often associate with and make mixed colonies with grackles. Boat-tailed grackles have established significant populations in several United States Gulf Coast cities and towns, where they can be found foraging in trash bins, dumpsters, and parking lots.
==Breeding==
The nest is a well-concealed cup in trees or shrubs near water; the average clutch size is just over three eggs.
==Description==
The male boat-tailed grackle is long and weighs . Adult males have entirely iridescent black plumage, a long dark bill, a pale yellowish or brown iris, and a long keel-shaped tail. The adult female is much smaller at long and a weight of . She is also distinguished by her shorter tail and tawny-brown coloration, which covers the body apart from the darker wings and tail. The wingspan in adult birds is . In standard measurements, this species measures along the wing bone, in tail length, along the culmen, and along the tarsus. On average, the boat-tailed grackle weighs about 10% more than the closely related great-tailed grackle, although the male great-tailed grackle has an even longer tail.

Young males are black but lack the adult&#x27;s iridescence. Immature females are duller versions of the adult female and have blotches or spots on the breast. The eye color of the boat-tailed grackle varies with range. Gulf Coast and inland birds have dark eyes, whereas Atlantic birds have pale eyes.
==Taxonomy==
The boat-tailed grackle was first described by French naturalist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1819. Its specific epithet &quot;major&quot; means &quot;larger&quot; in Latin. Despite its restricted range, there are four subspecies of the boat-tailed grackle, differing in size and iris color. The boat-tailed grackle was once considered the same species as the great-tailed grackle. The great-tailed species is generally quite similar of slightly smaller body size but has a longer tail and lacks this species&#x27; distinct domed head shape. The common grackle, with which the boat-tailed species often overlaps along the Atlantic coastline, is noticeably smaller and shorter-tailed, as well as lacking the domed head shape. 
==Diet==
They forage on the ground, in shallow water, or in shrubs; they will steal food from other birds. They are omnivorous, eating insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds, grain, and even small birds.
==Call==
Its song is a harsh &quot;jeeb&quot;, and it has a variety of typically grackle-like chatters and squeaks.

<doc id="702911" wikidata="Q458547" url="?curid=702911" title="Amboy, California">
<text>Amboy is an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert, west of Needles and east of Ludlow on historic Route 66. It is roughly northeast of Twentynine Palms. As of 2020, the town&#x27;s business district still contained a post office, a historic restaurant-motel, and a Route 66 tourist shop, all operated by the town&#x27;s population of four people. As of 2024, only the gas station was open, and the population was zero.

==History==
Although Amboy was first settled in 1858, the town was not established until 1883. Lewis Kingman, a locating engineer for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, created the town as the first of a series of alphabetical railroad stations that were to be constructed across the Mojave Desert. The name was probably taken from a location in the eastern United States.

In 1926, Amboy became a boom town after the opening of U.S. Route 66.

In 1938, Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café opened and prospered due to its isolated location on the route. By 1940, Amboy&#x27;s population had increased to 65. Its growth was tied not only to tourists, but also to the Santa Fe Railroad over which freight trains still run today between Kingman, Arizona and the BNSF Railway Barstow, California yard.

During the Great Depression and World War II, from 1929 through 1945, tourism declined nationally. But the remaining travelers&#x27; need for lodging, meals, and gasoline kept the town busy. The town remained this way until the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973, which bypassed Amboy.

In 2024, a news report stated that the population was zero, even though one business remained open.

==Geography==
The town is south of the Granite Mountains, Providence Mountains, and the Mojave National Preserve. Adjacent to the south is the landmark Amboy Crater, and beyond to the southeast the Bullion Mountains. To the south is Bristol Dry Lake and the community of Cadiz, California.

Amboy was once a major stop along the famous Route 66, but has seen much lower visitation since the opening of Interstate 40 to the north in 1973. Amboy is home to Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café, a Route 66 landmark.

In 2007, the town reportedly had a total of 10 surviving buildings and a population of far fewer than the advertised 20, which, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was approximately four. A resident interviewed in a short 2014 documentary also gave the population as four, all of whom are men. By 2024, however, the permanent resident population had declined to zero; only a single open business has kept Amboy from being declared a ghost town.

==Arts and culture==

===Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café===
Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café provided gasoline, food, and lodging. It was noted for its Googie &quot;retro-future&quot; architecture added to one of the original buildings, and its sign, a 1959 addition. Both Roy&#x27;s and the surrounding town were once owned by Buster Burris, one of Route 66&#x27;s most famous characters who purchased Roy&#x27;s from his father-in-law Roy Crowl, the man for whom the property is named, in 1938 and ran the town until 1995.

In 1938, Roy Crowl opened &quot;Roy&#x27;s&quot; as a service station on Route 66 in Amboy. Roy, together with his wife Velma, owned the town. In the 1940s Roy teamed up with Herman &quot;Buster&quot; Burris, who married Roy and Velma&#x27;s daughter Betty. Together, they expanded the business, keeping it open 24 hours a day and adding the motel to the service station and café. Business boomed in the deluge of motor tourists after World War II.

The routing of the old National Trails Highway (1914) and its better-traveled successor, Route 66 through Amboy saw a steady growth of business, especially at Roy&#x27;s. The complex was so busy during summer vacation that Burris placed classified ads in other states to bring in employees.

Buster sold the town in 1995, and moved to Twentynine Palms where he died in 2000. The town was owned by investors Walt Wilson and Tim White who mainly used it for photo shoots and to host movie companies. After the two lost it in foreclosure, it was repossessed by Bessie Burris, Buster&#x27;s widow. Bessie sold the property in February 2005 to Albert Okura, who died in 2023. Okura was the owner of the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. Okura offered $425,000 in cash and promised to preserve the town and reopen Roy&#x27;s.

The 2005 deal encompassed about 490 acres, including the town as well as Amboy and Route 66 landmark Roy&#x27;s Motel and Café, the church, post office, three gas pumps, two dirt airstrips and other buildings in the town. Okura planned to open a museum, much like he had with the original McDonald&#x27;s location in San Bernardino, turning it into an unofficial museum.

Okura reportedly had gotten the idea of buying a town from the real estate agent who sold him his first home. The agent shared that he regretted not buying a town when he had had the opportunity. Okura recounted the story in his book, &quot;Albert Okura: The Chicken Man with a 50 Year Plan&quot;. Unlike Tim White and Walt Wilson, who had marketed the town as a ghost-town location for film and television productions, Okura planned on restoring the town for Route 66 tourists and sees the purchase of the town as part of his &quot;destiny&quot;.

On April 28, 2008, Roy&#x27;s reopened. The renovations and repairs cost $100,000. Okura also planned to open a café and mini-mart at the same location; as of 2014, the restaurant remained closed for lack of an adequate potable water supply. As of 2015 the motel was still closed, too. A gift shop is open in the café, and gas is available on request. The motel has been used as a stage for art exhibits. 

Since his death in 2023, Okura&#x27;s efforts to save Amboy are being continued by his son Kyle. The hope is that the town can continue to grow. Roy&#x27;s has attracted some well-known regulars. Actors Harrison Ford and Anthony Hopkins have autographed photos on the walls of the restaurant and visit whenever their schedules allow. Ford frequently flies in and lands his plane on a nearby landing strip, one of the first ever built in California.

===Amboy School===

The former Amboy School is adjacent to Roy&#x27;s. The school closed in 1999 after the last students moved away.

==Media==
Part of the 1986 film &quot;The Hitcher&quot; with Rutger Hauer was filmed in Amboy. Roy&#x27;s was the setting for a 1999 television commercial for Qwest Communications. It was also used in Enrique Iglesias&#x27; music video &quot;Hero&quot; and the film &quot;Live Evil&quot;. The town&#x27;s former owners Walt Wilson and Timothy White maintained Amboy in weathered, unrestored condition for use as a motion picture film site.

In 1993, Huell Howser visited Amboy during episode 410 of &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; as part of his ongoing series visiting interesting areas of California. During the episode, he interviewed Buster Burris, the owner of Roy&#x27;s. The episode was aired on December 3, 1993, and also showed Wonder Valley in the Morongo Basin and the Amboy Crater.

==Trivia==

A fictional version of Amboy complete with Roy&#x27;s Hotel and sign was part of Ivan&#x27;s rig and roll map for 18 Wheels of Steel Haulin&#x27;.

A racing game Blur (2010) features Amboy at some of its tracks.

The heist film &quot;They Came To Rob Las Vegas&quot; (1968) occurs near Amboy, in the desert (which was actually filmed in Spain).

<text>The Academy of Sciences of Moldova (), established in 1961, is the main scientific organization of Moldova and coordinates research in all areas of science and technology. Ion Tighineanu has been the head of the Academy of Sciences since April 9, 2019.

==History==
As early as June 1946, the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences decided to establish the Moldovan Research Base of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Chisinau. In October 1949, the research base was transformed into the Moldavian branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The grand opening of the Academy took place on August 2, 1961. A meeting of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova in September 1994 confirms the reasoned scientific opinion of philologists that the correct name of the state language of Moldova is Romanian. Since September 2009, the University at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova has been operating in the country. In October 2017, President Igor Dodon signed a law that provides for the reform of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.

<doc id="702918" wikidata="Q6662593" url="?curid=702918" title="Lloyd Llewellyn">
<text>Lloyd Llewellyn (sometimes abbreviated LLLL) is a comic book by Daniel Clowes. The black-and-white series, published by Fantagraphics Books, ran for six issues from April 1986 to June 1987. A final &quot;special&quot; issue was published in December 1988.

Daniel Clowes published other Lloyd Llewellyn stories in other books by Fantagraphics.
- In [[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]] #13 which contains the Story &quot;The Last Time I sqaw Irving&quot; and a special preview page (Last Quarter 1985)
- in Doosmday Squad #2 (reprinting Charlton&#x27;s Doomsday+1 #2 by Joe Gil and John Byrne) we find the Story &quot;Under the Big Top&quot; (Early 1986)

The series&#x27; title character is a detective who has humorous adventures inspired by &quot;film noir&quot; and stereotypical 1950s lounge culture. Llewellyn has a sidekick who goes by the name of Ernie Hoyle. The series&#x27; police sergeant is called &quot;Red&quot; Hoerring. The series&#x27; visual style is influenced by lowbrow art.

The story &quot;The Nightmare&quot; from &quot;Lloyd Llewellyn&quot; #6 foreshadowed the approach of Clowes&#x27;s next comic, &quot;Eightball&quot;, by breaking the conventions of the series&#x27; crime setting and turning to social satire. Also in that issue, the author announces:

... And who knows ... somewhere along that lonesome road we might see a new LLLL mag with a brand new format so dazzling, so breathtaking, so monumentally fantastic that I haven&#x27;t even thought of it yet!

Early issues of &quot;Eightball&quot; included several additional Lloyd Llewellyn episodes. The character also made various cameo appearances in other &quot;Eightball&quot; stories.

<text>Malcolm Sharpe (April 2, 1936 – March 10, 2020) was an American television and radio personality with roots in San Francisco, California.

In the early 1960s, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-born Sharpe collaborated with Jim Coyle to create a series of comic on-the-street interviews for San Francisco radio station KGO. Armed with a tape recorder, Coyle and Sharpe confronted pedestrians with unusual questions or strange behavior. In a 1964 interview with &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, Sharpe explained &quot;We try to pose an almost plausible question, then proceed step by step into absurdity until the interviewee is seething.&quot;

After four years of recording short skits for KGO, Coyle and Sharpe recorded a hidden camera television pilot in 1964 called &quot;The Imposters&quot; with host George Fenneman but it remained unsold and was never aired in full. A 2006 four disc box set of 1960s material titled &quot;These 2 Men Are Impostors&quot; contains The Imposters pilot in addition to KGO radio recordings and previously unreleased pranks. Along with Coyle, he also recorded two comedy albums of street pranks in 1964 for the Warner Brothers record label. As a solo performer, he later released two albums.

In 1971, Sharpe continued as a solo interviewer with a syndicated TV series titled &quot;The Street People&quot;. In the 1980s he hosted a series of public television specials titled &quot;Mal Sharpe&#x27;s San Francisco&quot; which included a mixture of new material and older clips.

Sharpe was a &quot;trad jazz&quot; fan and said that he moved to San Francisco after seeing a Turk Murphy&#x27;s Jazz Band album cover. He began playing the trombone at 15, and although he &quot;had not kept it up&quot;, a chance request to sit in with a jazz group led to a regular gig at a North Beach, San Francisco nightclub in the late 1950s. In the 1980s he established his own Big Money In Jazz band. They regularly appeared at venues such as the Savoy Tivoli and Enrico’s in San Francisco and the No Name Bar in Sausalito.

Sharpe resided in Berkeley, California, with his wife. He hosted a jazz show, &quot;Back on Basin Street,&quot; from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. Sunday Pacific Time on KCSM at the College of San Mateo in California. The final &quot;Back on Basin Street&quot; was aired on Sunday, March 25, 2012. He died on March 10, 2020, of complications from heart surgery at the age of 83.

<doc id="702943" wikidata="Q5139999" url="?curid=702943" title="Code Adam">
<text>Code Adam is a missing-child safety program in the United States and Canada, originally created by Walmart retail stores in 1994. This type of alert is generally regarded as having been named in memory of Adam Walsh, the 6-year-old son of John Walsh (the host of Fox&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;).

Adam was abducted from a Sears department store in Hollywood, Florida in 1981. A search was undertaken by Adam&#x27;s mother, grandmother, and store employees, and public address calls were made for him every 10 to 15 minutes. After approximately 90 minutes of fruitless searching, local law enforcement was called. Sixteen days later, Adam&#x27;s severed head was found; his body was never recovered.

Today, many department stores, retail shops, shopping malls, supermarkets, amusement parks, hospitals, and museums participate in the Code Adam program. Legislation enacted by Congress in 2003 now mandates that all federal office buildings and base or post exchanges (BX or PX) on military bases adopt the program. Walmart, along with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the departments of several state Attorneys General, have offered to assist in training workshops in order for other companies to implement the program.

==Process==
Companies that do implement the program generally place a Code Adam decal at the front of the business. Employees at these businesses are trained to take the following steps, according to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children:
# If a visitor reports a child is missing, a detailed description of the child is obtained, which should include their name, age, hair color, eye color, approximate height and weight, clothing, and a photo if the visitor has one. Care is paid to the shoes, as they are harder to change than clothing.
# The employee goes to the nearest in-house telephone and pages Code Adam, describing the child&#x27;s physical features and clothing. The visitor will be directed to the entrance to help identify the child. Following the business&#x27;s Code Adam plan, some employees will monitor entrances and note down potentially useful information, while others search the business in sections. All employees will ask children for their names, and if the adult accompanying them is their parent. If an adult is seen attempting to leave with a child, employees must not physically intervene, to prevent putting the child or others at risk of immediate harm.
# Other than cashiers, all employees search likely hiding places for the missing child.
# The police are immediately called.
# If the child is located and appears to be lost or unharmed, their identity is verified.
# If the child is located with an adult that is not their parent or guardian, reasonable efforts will be employed to delay the departure of the adult without endangering staff or customer.
# After the child is either positively identified and reunited with their guardian or all collected information has been turned over to the police, an employee will page store-wide again to cancel the Code Adam.

<doc id="702948" wikidata="Q2042749" url="?curid=702948" title="Owyhee River">
<text>The Owyhee River is a tributary of the Snake River located in northern Nevada, southwestern Idaho and southeastern Oregon in the Western United States and its Pacific Northwest region. It is long.
The river&#x27;s drainage basin is in area, one of the largest subbasins of the Columbia River Basin with its major waterways of the Columbia River and Snake River. The mean annual discharge is , with a maximum of recorded in 1993 and a minimum of in 1954.

The Owyhee drains a remote area of the arid plateau region immediately north of the Great Basin of Central Nevada, rising in northeastern Nevada and flowing generally northward near the north-south Oregon / Idaho border to the Snake River. Its watershed is very sparsely populated. The Owyhee River and its tributaries flow through the Owyhee Plateau, cutting deep canyons, often with vertical walls and in some places over deep.

==History of the name==
The watershed of the river was part of region inhabited by the Shoshone and Bannock indigenous Native Americans / Indians. The name of the river is from the older spelling of &quot;Hawaii&quot;. It was named for three Native Hawaiian trappers (from the then little-known far-off Hawaiian Islands chain in the middle of the Pacific Ocean). They were in the employ of the old North West Company (1779–1821), (business / commercial competitive rivals of the more famous Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which still exists in the 21st century). The North West Company was headquartered north of the Great Lakes and along the St. Lawrence River at Montreal, Quebec (then the province of Lower Canada in British North America, today is the modern Dominion of Canada), who were sent to explore the uncharted river in the Rocky Mountains wilderness of the Pacific Northwest region and far western North America continent. They failed to return to the rendezvous camp near the Boise River and were never seen again. Due to this the river and its region were subsequently named &quot;Owyhee&quot;.

About one-third of the men with Donald MacKenzie&#x27;s Snake Country Expeditions of 1819–1820 were Hawaiians, commonly called &quot;Kanakas&quot; or &quot;Sandwich Islanders&quot; in those days, with &quot;Owyhee&quot; being a standard period spelling of the proper Hawaiian language name for the islands, &quot;hawai&#x27;i&quot;, which then was otherwise unused in English. The three Kanakas were detached to trap on the river in 1819 and were probably killed by Native Americans that year. It was not until the spring or early summer of 1820 that MacKenzie learned the news of their deaths (probably at the hands of men belonging to a band of Bannocks led by a chief named The Horse). Native Americans led other trappers to the site, but only one skeleton was located. The earliest surviving record of the name is found on a map dating to 1825, drawn by William Kittson (who was previously with MacKenzie in 1819–1820, and then with Peter Skene Ogden (1790–1854), in 1825), on which he notes &quot;Owhyhee River&quot; (his spelling). Journal entries in 1826 by Peter Skene Ogden, a fur trapper who led subsequent Snake Country Expeditions for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company refer to the river primarily as the &quot;Sandwich Island River&quot;, but also as &quot;S. I. River&quot;, &quot;River Owyhee&quot;, and &quot;Owyhee River&quot;.

==History==

===Mining===
The discovery of gold and silver deposits in the region in 1863 resulted in a usual &quot;rush&quot; of a temporary influx of prospectors / miners and the establishment of mining camps and ramshackle towns, most of which have long since decayed into ruins or disappeared. The initial discovery was along Jordan Creek, and mining activity rapidly spread through the Owyhee watershed in the 1860s. This activity involved not only placer operations, but also the digging of underground mine shafts and mills, resulting in a prolonged history of 19th century mining in the region.

===Death of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau===

On May 16, 1866, the Indian Lemhi Shoshone-French son of Sacagawea, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau (1805–1866), died at age 61 years old, near Jordan Creek / Owyhee River and Jordan Valley after catching a chill upon crossing the Owyhee River en route from California to new gold field strikes in the old Montana Territory. 

After almost a century of neglect, his grave is now well marked, off the highway of U.S. Route 95 (see U.S. Route 95 in Oregon), near Danner, Oregon at .

==Course==
The source of the Owyhee River is in northeastern Nevada, in northern Elko County, approximately north of the county seat / town of Elko. It flows north along the east side of the Independence Mountains of Nevada, passing through Wild Horse Reservoir and then cutting northeast past the north end of the range. The river runs through the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, and then past the communities of Mountain City and Owyhee in the Duck Valley Indian Reservation of Nevada. It then enters southwestern Idaho, flowing northwest for approximately across the southwest corner of the state through Owyhee County. It is then joined by the South Fork Owyhee River from the south, approximately east of the Oregon border. The main tributary of the South Fork is the Little Owyhee River.

The Owyhee River then enters extreme southeast corner of Oregon in southern Malheur County, generally flowing north in a zigzag course west of the north-south Oregon / Idaho state border. It merges with the West Little Owyhee River from the south, then receives the Middle Fork Owyhee River and North Fork Owyhee River from the east at a location known as &quot;Three Forks.&quot; It then passes through the Owyhee Canyon between Big Grassy Mountain and Whitehouse Butte, then turns north, flowing east of Burns Junction and then west of Mahogany Mountain. In this area the Owyhee River receives the tributaries of Jordan Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, and Crooked Creek.

The Owyhee River enters the Snake River from the west on the Oregon–Idaho border approximately south of Nyssa, Oregon, and south of the mouth of the Boise River. The final stretch of the river, below Owyhee Dam, emerges from the Owyhee Plateau and enters the Snake River Plain.

===River modifications===

In northern Malheur County, approximately upstream from its mouth on the Snake, the Owyhee River is impounded by the Owyhee Dam, creating the serpentine Lake Owyhee, approximately long. The dam was constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (part of the United States Department of the Interior), primarily to provide irrigation for the agricultural region in southeast Oregon and southwest Idaho, onions and hops are the staple crops in this region. Lake Owyhee State Park and scenic Leslie Gulch are along the eastern shore of the reservoir. Owyhee Dam was built in 1933 and eliminated anadromous fish such as spawning salmon from the Owyhee River basin.

==Protected areas==
In 1984, the United States Congress designated of the river as Owyhee Wild and Scenic River under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 to preserve the river in its free-flowing condition. Part of the designation includes the section of the river downstream from the Owyhee Dam, where the river flows through a remote section of deeply incised canyons surrounded by high canyon rims that are habitat for mountain lion, bobcat, mule deer, California bighorn sheep, and a large variety of raptors.

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 designated on and around the Owyhee River in Idaho as wilderness. The bill was signed into law by 44th President Barack Obama (born 1961, served 2009–2017), two months after his inauguration on March 30, 2009. The new wilderness areas are:

* North Fork Owyhee Wilderness – 
* Owyhee River Wilderness – 
* Pole Creek Wilderness – 
The two United States Senators representing Oregon in the U.S. Senate (upper chamber of the Congress) at the United States Capitol in the federal national capital city of far to the east of Washington, D.C., Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley (both Democrats), introduced the Owyhee Act in November 2019. It would preserve of Owyhee canyonlands as wilderness, while calling for improvements to loop roads to bring in visitors. It also designated of the river for protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. It was supported by both ranchers and conservationists, as well as the Northwest Sport Fishing Association. With the bill stalled for several years, governor Tina Kotek and other advocates called for President Biden to make the area a national monument in August 2024.

==Tributaries==
* Jordan Creek is a tributary. It flows generally west from near Silver City, Idaho, in the Owyhee Mountains to near Rome in the Oregon High Desert.
* The West Little Owyhee River has a source at an elevation of near the Nevada-Oregon border by the community of McDermitt, Nevada. Approximately in length, the river flows east by Deer Flat and into Louse Canyon. Near a prominent feature known as Twin Buttes, it turns sharply north as it cuts through the Owyhee Desert, making its way to the Owyhee River.
* The Lake Fork West Owyhee River is a short tributary of the West Little Owyhee River that begins near the Cat, Bend, and Pedroli springs near the eastern boundary of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation (for the Paiute and Shoshone native tribes) near the old U.S. Army cavalry post of Fort McDermitt (1865 / 1866–1889), in southern Malheur County, Oregon. It flows generally northeast to meet the larger river in Louse Canyon. The Lake Fork has no named tributaries.
* The Little Owyhee River is a long tributary of the South Fork Owyhee River. Beginning at an elevation of east of the Santa Rosa Range in eastern Humboldt County, Nevada, it flows generally east into Elko County, Nevada and the Owyhee Desert.
* Blue Creek is a long tributary that begins at an elevation of in central Owyhee County, it flows generally south through the Owyhee Desert and near the community of Riddle, where it is roughly paralleled by Idaho State Highway 51. It then flows into the Duck Valley Indian Reservation to its mouth near the east-west Idaho/Nevada state border, northwest of Owyhee, Nevada, at an elevation of .

<doc id="702958" wikidata="Q2506193" url="?curid=702958" title="Token (railway signalling)">
<text>In railway signalling, a token is a physical object which a train driver is required to have or see before entering onto a particular section of single track. The token is clearly endorsed with the names of the section to which it belongs. A token system is more commonly used for single lines because of the greater risk of collision in the event of a mistake being made by a signaller or traincrew than on double lines.

== Principle ==

The operation of a bidirectional single track line has the hazard of two trains colliding. The simplest way to prevent such collisions is to have only one train in the section at any given time. Such a system is known as &quot;one-engine-in-steam” (OES) or “one-train working&quot; (OTW). This system is used on some branches of rail networks, and on heritage railways. The main disadvantage is that it restricts the number of train movements that can be made. For a larger railway system, it becomes exceptionally limiting in the level of operations that it allows, with the increased risk of mistakes being made, possibly leading to a collision.

Instead, reliance is placed not on employing only one train but on having a single physical object, known as a &quot;token&quot;, available for the single track section, and ruling that a driver may enter the single line section only if in physical possession of that object. Existing in a variety of physical forms, such as a staff, tablet, key, or ball, the object is marked to indicate to which single track section it belongs.

== Token systems ==
=== Token only ===
The token system was developed in Britain in the 19th century, to enable safe working of single-line railways. For the very first time this system was proposed by Mr. Henry Woodhouse for Standedge Tunnels in 1849. If a branch line is a dead end with a simple shuttle train service, then a single token is sufficient. The driver of any train entering the branch line (or occupying any part of it) must be in possession of the token, and no collision with another train is possible. 

For convenience in passing it from hand to hand, the token was often in the form of a staff, typically long and diameter, and is referred to as a &quot;train staff&quot;. Such a staff is usually literally a wooden staff with a brass plate stating the two signal boxes between which it is valid.

In UK terminology, this method of working on simple branch lines was originally referred to as &quot;One Engine in Steam (OES)&quot;, and later &quot;One-Train Working (OTW)&quot;. However the system was used on long through lines as well; R H Dutton, Chairman of the London and South Western Railway explained in 1876 the slow journey time between Exeter and Plymouth by saying, &quot;the cause of the delay is the stopping at every station on the staff system. That really does cause a great delay because if the staff is not there, the train must stop while a man is sent on a horse to get it [from the other end of the section]&quot;; quoted in Williams.

=== Staff and ticket ===
Using only a single token does not provide convenient operation when consecutive trains are to be worked in the same direction. The simple token system was therefore extended: if one train was to be followed by another in the same direction, the driver of the first train was required to be shown the token, but not take possession of it (in theory he was supposed to physically touch the token, but this was not strictly followed). The driver was given a written authority to enter the single line section, referred to as the &quot;ticket&quot;. The train could then proceed, and a second train could follow. In the earliest days, the second train could proceed after a designated time interval, as on double lines at the time. However, after the Armagh rail disaster of 1889, block working became mandatory.

Seeing the train staff provided assurance that there could be no head-on collision. To ensure that the ticket was not issued incorrectly, a book of numbered tickets was kept in a locked box, the key to which was permanently fastened to the token, or was the token. In addition, the lock prevented the token from being removed until the ticket box was closed, and it could not be closed unless the book of tickets was in the box. Once a ticket was issued, its number was recorded in a Train Register book, and the token was locked in a secure place. The system is known as &quot;staff and ticket.&quot;

In a variation on that principle, called &quot;divisible train staff&quot;, a section of the token or staff, referred to as the &quot;ticket portion&quot;, was designed to be removed and handed to the driver, instead of a paper ticket.

=== Electric token ===


The &quot;staff and ticket&quot; system was still too inflexible for busy lines, as it did not allow for the situation where the train intended to carry the actual token was cancelled or running very late. To provide for this, the electric train token system was developed. Each single-line section is provided with a pair of token instruments, one at the signal box at each end. A supply of identical tokens is stored in the instruments, which are connected by telegraph lines. A token can be removed from one instrument only if both signalmen co-operate in agreeing to the release. Once a token has been removed, another cannot be removed until the token which is &quot;out&quot; is replaced in either instrument. (There are variations on this sequence of events.) By this means, it can be ensured that at any one time, only one token is available to be issued to a driver. Tokens belonging to adjacent sections have different &quot;configurations&quot; to prevent them being inserted into the wrong instrument.

Nevertheless, a head-on collision occurred on a section of single track on the Cambrian Railways on 18 January 1918. The drivers of both engines held the correct token, issued from Tyer&#x27;s token machines as they started their respective journeys, but the electrical circuits linking the machines at either end were also used for telephones and, together with a possible line fault caused by bad weather, this allowed the issue of two tokens at the same time. In the Abermule train collision of 1921, also on the Cambrian Railways, lax working procedures allowed the safeguards provided by the electric token system to be circumvented; a driver was handed a token for the wrong section, and proceeded on the mistaken belief that the token was correct. To try to prevent this, the UK Board of Trade Railway Inspectorate recommended that the signals controlling entry to the single line section (&quot;starting&quot; or &quot;section&quot; signals) were locked at danger unless a token had been released from the relevant token instrument. This was not universally adopted and many single line sections continued without such safeguards well into the 1960s.
== Collection of the token ==
In a basic railway situation, the token can be collected personally by the driver at the start of the crew&#x27;s work on a branch line, and surrendered at the end of their work there.

Where the single line section is part of a through route, then it is likely that each passing train would require to surrender and collect a token at each token station. Where the trains stop at every station this is a convenient arrangement, but where some trains run through without requiring to make a call (i.e. express trains), it was necessary for the signalman to exchange tokens with the fireman (in the case of steam trains) as the train passed at slow speed. In the case of driver-only operated trains, a dead-mans hold over button was provided, so the driver could exchange the token without the emergency brake being applied.
A large staff could be handed over without any special apparatus, but if the system in use employed miniature staffs, tablets or key tokens, these were usually placed in a leather pouch attached to a hoop, and the fireman could put their arm through the hoop held up by the signalman, and vice versa as the locomotive ran past. In UK practice the permitted speed for this was in daylight, but there are stories of drivers anxious to make up lost time when running late, and passing the exchange point at much higher speeds; bruised upper arms were common among signalmen and firemen on such lines.

Fixed token exchange apparatus was used on some railways. Trackside equipment was fitted near each signal box to hold the pouch containing the token and to receive the token pouch that was being given up.

=== Automatic exchange ===

Certain railways developed mechanical systems that enabled faster handover using catcher devices. These could be extended from the locomotive cabside just before the train passed the exchange point and then automatically retracted afterwards. These enabled handover speeds of . Examples of such systems include the Whitaker system on the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway and the Manson system on the Midland &amp; Great Northern Joint Railway and the Great North of Scotland Railway. When the Aberdeen to Inverness passenger service was converted to diesel multiple unit operation in the late 1950s, the train-borne equipment was fixed adjacent to the train guard&#x27;s compartment. A special buzzer code confirmed to the guard that the correct token had been successfully received.

Mechanical staff exchangers were also used where trains did not stop on the single line sections of the Main South, Main North and North Coast lines of the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia. On the Victorian Railways automatic staff exchangers survived on the North Eastern, Western, and Geelong-Ballarat lines until as recently as the late 1980s. On the South Australian Railways, auto staff exchangers were used on the former broad-gauge line between Adelaide and Port Pirie. In all these Australian states, both steam and later diesel electric locomotives were fitted with auto exchangers. On the New Zealand Railways, where most lines are single track, multiple systems were used like the Winter’s block system and Sykes’ lock and block working. On the North Island Main Trunk and on other lines like the Wairarapa Line, the Tyer’s Electric Train Tablet with the No. 7 instrument was used. Tablet exchangers were developed by Wynne after trials of the Australian design by Quirke. The tablet system allowed for banking engines used for steep sections with a separate bank engine key.

== Electronic token systems ==

Advances in technology led to the development of electronic token systems. Trains are able to run over consecutive single-track sections, with the operation being controlled by radio from a central control room. Every train carries an electronic unit that receives and sends an encrypted block of data which represents the token. The system is designed so that the control centre cannot issue a new token for a section of line until the current one is &#x27;returned&#x27;. Trains cannot send tokens to each other. This system allows the whole line to operate without any additional signalling personnel, and has functioned without major incident.

The Ternkey System (derived from an acronym for &quot;token exchange using random numbers&quot;) is a hybrid between conventional token working and internet technology. Conventional &quot;trapped key&quot; pin tumbler locks (held in fixed position by solenoids) are mounted in key-release units set up at each end of controlled single line. The number of locks in each unit is determined by the expected traffic frequency; optionally at times short sections may be combined to reduce the number of stops . The units are connected to a central control computer by internet. The central computer conducts a &quot;census&quot; of keys before releasing a solenoid and freeing a key for the required section of track—an engraved tag identifying the respective section of track is securely attached to the relevant key. The system is in use on the Isle of Man Railway between Castletown and Port Erin.

== Variations ==

=== Intermediate block posts ===

In certain circumstances it was convenient to shorten the single line sections by providing an intermediate signal box equipped with token instruments without providing a passing loop there. This was done if there was, for example, an important siding connection at the intermediate location. It also enabled following through trains to run at closer headways, but did not facilitate opposing movements.

Because of the greater risk of collision in the event of irregular working, the practice was deprecated in the UK, although some examples did exist for example at Beddington Lane on the Wimbledon – West Croydon line before resignalling. Usually in such cases special interlocking was provided between the two instruments at the intermediate signal box to ensure that trains could not be accepted from opposing directions at the same time.

A disaster at such an intermediate location occurred on the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway at Foxcote, near Radstock, in the Foxcote collision of 1876. This occurred before the S&amp;DJR was equipped for token working and was relying on block instruments only – a catalogue of errors led to two passenger trains entering the same section from opposite ends.

=== Long section working ===

In double line working, at times when traffic is light it is convenient to &quot;switch out&quot; an intermediate signal box, allowing the signal boxes on either side to communicate directly for train control. On single lines this is more complicated because of the train tokens being identified with single line sections, but the difficulty can be overcome by some form of long section working.

A simple system used separable train staffs which fit together when intermediate block posts are closed, so that a driver receives the train staff for two or more consecutive sections from the first signalman. An alternative system employs special long-section token systems; when long section working is to be instituted, all the short section tokens must be in their respective instruments; by switching to the long-section method, tokens for the long section can then be obtained in the ordinary way. Obviously all the long-section tokens must be restored before the normal working can be resumed.

=== Unattended operation ===
Token instruments can be arranged for unattended operation, when they are operated by the train crew at intermediate crossing loops or at the terminus of the line. This system is widely found in Australia, where traffic density on many lines is low.

In the UK it is known as the &quot;No-signalman key token system&quot;. Examples on the UK national network are the North Devon Line, where the system was brought into use on 1 December 1987, the Heart of Wales Line (commissioned in 1986), the Derwent Valley Line in Derbyshire and the Liskeard to Looe line in Cornwall. On the latter, the train guard not only operates the Tyer&#x27;s No.9 electric token instrument controlling the upper section of the branch, but operates the points as well. The lower section is operated on the &quot;One Engine in Steam&quot; principle with a simple wooden staff. Possession of the staff is required to unlock the ground frame controlling the points at Coombe Junction, where the two sections meet. There is no other signalling on the branch except to control entry and exit to and from the main line.

=== Token interlinking ===
After early experience with token systems, it became customary for the starting signal at token stations to be interlinked with the token instrument; on withdrawal of a token, the starting signal lever was released for one pull.

Sometimes an intermediate siding is provided on the single line section, and the token itself, or a key fixed to the end of it, unlocks the points for shunting there. The token is locked in the apparatus there, and the driver cannot retrieve the token until the points have been set to the through running position and locked again. In special situations where the sidings at the intermediate location are extensive, the equipment is arranged for the shunting train to be put wholly inside the sidings, clear of the main line; in this situation an intermediate token instrument can be provided, enabling the driver to surrender the token so that normal through working can take place on the single line while their train is at the sidings.

A corresponding arrangement sometimes applied where permanent way maintenance was carried out by motorised trolley. Usually this used special &quot;occupation key&quot; instruments which were interlocked with the normal token instruments and provided at intermediate places where the trolley might be off-tracked (or stored overnight).

=== Working by pilotman ===

A variation of the token system is &quot;working by pilotman&quot;, where the place of the token is taken by a person who is designated the &quot;pilotman&quot;. This system is instituted if there is a failure of the token apparatus, a signal failure within a single line section, or on double lines when one line is blocked and traffic is to be worked in both directions over the remaining line.

The pilotman (identified by a red armband with &quot;PILOTMAN&quot; in white letters) rides in the cab with the driver, or if another train is due to follow, the pilotman must issue the driver with a single line working ticket and authorise him to enter the section. The signalman must not clear the starting signal until instructed by the pilotman to do so. The pilotman must ride with the driver if it is the last train to run in that direction. Thus pilotman working is analogous to the &quot;staff and ticket&quot; system, described above, where the pilotman himself becomes the token and his verbal instruction is the equivalent of the ticket.

It is sometimes necessary to provide the pilotman with a personal locomotive to cater for disruptions to the service. In such a case the pilotman&#x27;s locomotive is usually coupled to the front of the actual train, but practice may vary depending on local track layout, types of trains etc.

The use of a pilotman for such purposes pre-dates the use of tokens.

== Present-day use ==

Until the late 20th century, the token system was standard on British single-track lines and it still remains on a number of lines there as well as elsewhere, such as the line between and Stranraer in south west Scotland. Traditional token systems are also in use on heritage railways in Britain, for example on the Mid Hants Railway and the West Somerset Railway which is fitted throughout with Tyer&#x27;s electric token instruments. The Bluebell Railway has short section token working between adjacent boxes and long section working available between Sheffield Park and Kingscote.

The token system was in use on the Hurstbridge railway line, Melbourne, Australia between Greensborough and Eltham (Miniature Electric Staff) and Eltham and Hurstbridge (Train Staff and Ticket) until replaced by electronic signalling in early 2013. The Greensborough to Eltham section was abolished on 31 January 2013, along with half of the Eltham to Hurstbridge section, as far as Diamond Creek. The final Diamond Creek to Hurstbridge section was abolished on 22 March 2013.

The Puffing Billy Railway in Melbourne, Victoria, has used a staff and ticket system since it was originally opened from Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook. The current line from Belgrave to Gembrook has permanent staff stations at Belgrave, Menzies Creek, Lakeside and Gembrook. A temporary staff station exists at Emerald town to allow trains to pass at Emerald on busy days. For the Emerald temporary staff to be activated, the Menzies Creek to Lakeside staff is required to be locked away at Menzies Creek. A similar situation occurs with Cockatoo station, whereby for it to be enacted as a Temporary Staff Station, the Lakeside to Gembrook staff is required to be locked away at Lakeside.

The token method of working is sometimes still used for temporary situations such as through engineering works or where the signalling system has yet to be provided. In December 1981, a new underground line was opened in Melbourne, which provided a circular service around the city&#x27;s central business district. Although normal services were not to begin for some time, for two months special services operated on Sundays to allow people to try the new line, and for this period the line operated with a train staff, although there was no provision for tickets to be used.

A very unusual token working was instituted on the line between Pakenham and Traralgon in Victoria, Australia for several months in 2006 whilst the line was being upgraded. During this period, the line was closed during the day, but opened each night to allow a few goods trains through. The line is double track between Pakenham and Moe (except for a short single track section). Three staffs were provided for the 100 km length, one each for the sections Pakenham—Warragul, Warragul—Moe, and Moe—Traralgon. The first two of these are partly or totally double-track sections, but the staffs in this case were applicable to both tracks, the effect being that only one of the tracks could be used at a time.

The token system is still regularly used on the present-day State Railway of Thailand system. Although most use occurs in regional areas, some use appears in the capital city, Bangkok, such as the Makkasan to Khlong Tan section etc.

Sri Lanka Railways uses a tablet exchanging system on the up-country railway line.

Russian Railways uses Electric Token Block on some lines, most notably the Yanisyarvi – Lodeynoe Pole railway.

The electric staff instruments manufactured by Webb and Thompson shown in the picture above are in use on the Buenos Aires (Constitución Station) to Mar del Plata line (Ferrocarril Roca) in Argentina, as of 2019.

The token system is also used on the Seaton tramway between Seaton and Riverside and on the running lines of some tram museums.

In Malaysia, signaling token signs are still used on the KTM East Coast Line between Gemas and Tumpat. Although Gemas Station mainly serves the Electric Train Service, it still receive tokens from trains arriving from Bahau Station on the East Coast Line. Similarly, the Gemas Station Master needs to pass a key token for trains bound for the East Coast. The final token exchange normally happens at Tumpat and Gemas but this also happens at Kuala Lipis and Dabong as these two stations are the terminus of some Eastern Shuttle (SH) train services. This system was officially abolished on KTM&#x27;s West Coast Line following the completion of the Ipoh - Padang Besar Electrified Double Track Project in 2014.

<text>Otis Crandall Davis (July 12, 1932 – September 14, 2024) was an American athlete, winner of two gold medals for record-breaking performances in the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He set a new world record of 44.9 seconds in the 400 m and became the first person to break the 45-second barrier.

==Early life==
Otis Crandall Davis was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on July 12, 1932. He was black and Native American. 
His father, Johnie Davis, worked as a bellhop, and his mother, Mary Alice Davis, taught science and worked as a movie theater cashier. He grew up in a segregated Alabama, and was raised by his maternal grandmother, Carrie Eaton.

He served four years in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.

==Career==

===College===
Following the Air Force, Davis attended enrolled at Los Angeles City College, where he played basketball. In 1957, he transferred to the University of Oregon on a basketball scholarship. One day in 1958 while observing athletes running on the track with a friend, Davis, who had never run before, nor attended schools in his youth with sports programs other than basketball and football, decided that he could beat the athletes he saw on the track. He approached track coach Bill Bowerman, who would later become the founding father of the Nike, Inc., and asked to join the track team. Needing high jumpers instead, Bowerman had Davis try his hand.

Among Davis&#x27;s first attempts, he jumped 6&#x27;0&quot;. He recalled: &quot;I had no form. I had no style. I just jumped.&quot; He also hit 23&#x27;0&quot; in the long jump with little effort, though he was flustered by the sprinting events, relating &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know how to get in the starting blocks&quot;. For his first competitive event, Bowerman entered Davis in the 220-yard dash and the 440-yard dash in the Pacific Coast Conference championships, both of which he won, missing the school record by two tenths of a second in the latter.

According to Davis, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for him, contradicting the claim that they were made for Phil Knight: &quot;I told Tom Brokaw that I was the first. I don&#x27;t care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me. People don&#x27;t believe me. In fact, I didn&#x27;t like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they were too tight. But I saw Bowerman make them from the waffle iron, and they were mine.&quot;

In 1959, Davis finished seventh in the 440-yard dash in the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

In 1960, he graduated from the University of Oregon with a B.S. degree in Health &amp; Physical Education. The University honored him in 2020, as one of eight gold medalists who attended the school. In addition, Davis, along with Bill Bowerman, Ashton Eaton, Steve Prefontaine and Raevyn Rogers, are depicted on a nine-foot tower adjacent to Hayward Field.

===Olympic===

Davis was competing on a national level for the Oregon Ducks, and was poised to become a national AAU champion in the 440-yard run. At the age of 28, he made the 1960 United States Olympic team, placing third in the 400-meter race at the Olympic Trials. He ran his fastest time to date one week before participating in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome as one of the oldest members of the track team, where he was nicknamed &quot;Pops&quot; by his teammates. He remembered: &quot;I was still learning how to turn with the staggered starts and all. I was still learning the strategy involved. I was still learning how to run in the lanes.&quot;

On September 6, 1960, Davis ran against the heavily favored German athlete Carl Kaufmann, who was born in Brooklyn and held the world record in the 400-meter dash. Davis won by a hair, setting a world record of 44.9 seconds and becoming the first man to break the heralded 45-second barrier. The photo of the finish, with (in full horizontal dive position) Kaufmann&#x27;s nose ahead of Davis, but his torso behind, has been studied and discussed by track and field officials for years. Both athletes were awarded the world record time, recorded in the 10ths of a second in those days, but Davis was awarded the win. Two days later, they met again for the 4 × 400 m relay final. Davis anchored the USA team of Jack Yerman, Earl Young and 400-meter hurdles gold medalist Glenn Davis, setting a world record of 3:02.2. The photo of the finish of that race was also made famous in &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

In 1996 he was a torch-bearer for the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

===Post-Olympic===

Following the Olympics, Davis competed in some sporadic track meets, such as the 1961 U.S. Nationals at Randall&#x27;s Island, which he won at age 29, but his competitive running career was virtually over, as he never repeated his Olympic performance. He returned to Oregon, and later considered playing as wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams. After retiring from competition, he became a high school teacher, working in Springfield, Oregon, for many years, and then traveled overseas to work as an athletic director at United States military bases, including McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, where he taught in 1989.

In 1991, Davis moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, in order to live closer to New York, eventually settling in Union City.&gt; Around 2002 or 2003. Davis was hired by the Union City Board of Education, and began working at Emerson High School as a truancy officer, teacher, coach and mentor. When he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2003, he asked Emerson Principal Robert Fazio to accompany him to the ceremony in Los Angeles, and when the rest of the school&#x27;s staff learned he was an Olympic medalist, they honored him with a banner posted in a hallway in the school honoring his achievements.
In 2012, Davis was working as a verification officer at Union City High School, mentoring students. He was also co-founder and, in 2012, president of the Tri-States Olympic Alumni Association, a member of the University of Oregon Hall of Fame and the New Jersey Sports Writers&#x27; Halls of Fame.

Davis ran athletic skills programs during the spring and summer in Union City, in order to reach students who did not normally participate in sporting events, and to complement the schools&#x27; physical education curricula. Among programs he directed were the Mayor&#x27;s Cup, first held on June 6, 2011, in which students from the city&#x27;s several elementary schools compete in events that include sprinting, spring relays and circle relays, and the Sports Challenge, which provides special needs children with the opportunity to be a part of sports activities.

In 2023, Davis published a memoir, &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Daredevil: The Autobiography of an Olympic Champion Helping Others Cross the Finish Line.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Davis was married to and divorced from Lucille Mathes, and had two daughters.

In 1994, burglars stole Davis&#x27;s gold medals from his home in New Jersey, but they were recovered and returned within a month.

Davis died in North Bergen, New Jersey, on September 14, 2024, at the age of 92.

<doc id="702972" wikidata="Q1965882" url="?curid=702972" title="Legal translation">
<text>Legal translation is the translation of language used in legal settings and for legal purposes. Legal translation may also imply that it is a specific type of translation only used in law, which is not always the case. As law is a culture-dependent subject field, legal translation is not necessarily linguistically transparent. Intransparency in translation can be avoided somewhat by use of Latin legal terminology, where possible, but in non-western languages debates are centered on the origins and precedents of specific terms, such as in the use of particular Chinese characters in Japanese legal discussions. 

Intransparency can lead to expensive misunderstandings in terms of a contract, for example, resulting in avoidable lawsuits. Legal translation is thus usually done by specialized law translators. Conflicts over the legal impact of a translation can be avoided by indicating that the text is &quot;authentic&quot; i.e. legally operative on its own terms or instead is merely a &quot;convenience translation&quot;, which itself is not legally operative. Courts only apply authentic texts and do not rely on &quot;convenience&quot; translations in adjudicating rights and duties of litigants.

== Source text and target text ==
Most legal writing is exact and technical, seeking to precisely define legally binding rights and duties. Thus, precise correspondence of these rights and duties in the source text and in the translation is essential. As well as understanding and precisely translating the legal rights and duties established in the translated text, legal translators must also bear in mind the legal system of the source text (ST) and the legal system of the target text (TT) which may differ greatly from each other. This is a challenge because it requires that the translator have substantial legal knowledge as well as the multiple legal systems that can exist in one language. Examples of different legal systems include Anglo-American common law, Islamic law, or customary tribal law for examples.

Apart from terminological lacunae (lexical gaps), textual conventions in the source language are often culture-dependent and may not correspond to conventions in the target culture (see e.g. Nielsen 2010). Linguistic structures that are often found in the source language may have no direct equivalent structures in the target language. The translator therefore has to be guided by certain standards of linguistic, social and cultural equivalence between the language used in the source text (ST) to produce a text (TT) in the target language. Those standards correspond to a variety of different principles defined as different approaches to translation in translation theory. Each of the standards sets a certain priority among the elements of ST to be preserved in TT. For example, following the functional approach, translators try to find target language structures with the same functions as those in the source language thus value the functionality of a text fragment in ST more than, say, the meanings of specific words in ST and the order in which they appear there.

== Translation issues ==
The usage of transcription in the context of linguistic discussions has been controversial. Typically, two kinds of linguistic records are considered to be scientifically relevant. First, linguistic records of general acoustic features, and secondly, records that only focuses on the distinctive phonemes of a language. While transcriptions are not entirely illegitimate, transcriptions without enough detailed commentary regarding any linguistic features used has a great chance of the content being misinterpreted. An example that highlights this complication with transcription is displaying dialect in writing. The fundamental problem with this situation is that the transcribed product is not simply a spoken language in its written form, but a language the transcriber is responsible for writing down and a language that has been transcribed by someone other than the speaker, no matter the level of understanding the transcriber has for the spoken language. Any transcription is an interpretation of the speech no matter how detailed it is, and will be selective in what it includes or leave out. Because of this reason, it is important to strategically choose the form of transcription in order to properly represent the spoken language in a written form.

Different approaches to translation should not be confused with different approaches to translation theory. The former are the standards used by translators in their trade while the latter are just different paradigms used in developing translation theory. Few jurists are familiar with terms of translation theory. They may ask interpreters and translators to provide translation. They often view this term as a clear standard of quality that they desire in TT. However, verbatim translation usually is undesirable due to different grammar structures as well as different legal terms or rules in different legal systems. When it comes to translating, it can be difficult to find the correct words to translate the same information given because not all words that are translated can have the same meaning. There are many cultures around the world that the legal translation has to be exact. It is important that Legal Translators be able to interpret one word from a given language to another while still being able to maintain the same impact and meaning of the legal word.

== Bilingual law dictionaries ==
Legal translators often consult specialized bilingual or polyglot law dictionaries. Care should be taken, as some bilingual law dictionaries are of poor quality and their use may lead to mistranslation. Bilingual legal dictionaries tend to largely be a source of reference for interpretation, rather than a source of literal equivalent translations of legal terminology. Translating legal text from one language to another becomes a challenge for legal experts because there is a level of freedom to translating texts that retain meaning and not necessarily maintaining equivalent semantic structure. There is also a debate between experts to either restrict the legal language to the target text for professional use or to broaden legal language for the use and comprehension of the public, specifically in societies with bilingual law system.

<text>Steinunn Sigurðardóttir (born 26 August 1950) is an Icelandic poet and novelist.

She finished her university studies in 1972 with a BA in psychology and philosophy at University College Dublin. Since then, she has worked as a journalist for radio and television. She has lived in different places in Europe, the United States and Japan. Since the mid-nineties, she has mostly lived abroad − first in Paris, now in Berlin.

== Career ==
At the beginning of her writing career, until the 1980s, she published poems and short stories, thus becoming rather well known in her country.

In 1995, she received the Icelandic National Prize for Literature for her novel &quot;Hjartastaður&quot; (&quot;Heart Place&quot;). In this novel, the author describes the difficult relationship between a mother living alone with her teenage daughter and the young girl. The text is integrating some elements of a road movie, because the protagonists are on a journey through Iceland from Reykjavík to the east coast. At the same time, a gang of drug dealers, friends of the daughter, are in hot pursuit. This sounds a bit like a crime novel, but the author is more interested in the psychology of the relationship and in descriptions of Iceland&#x27;s south and its nature, for example a sandstorm.

Her first novel &quot;Tímaþjófurinn&quot; (&quot;The Thief of Time&quot;, 1986) was also a big success. In this novel, the love between two teachers is in the center of the story. The woman is rather experienced and living in the High Society because of her family background, whereas her younger colleague is married and more concentrated on his work than she. The style of the novel is interesting: Poems are integrated in the text. In 1998, the novel was turned into a film in France under the title &quot;Stolen Life&quot; directed by Yves Angelo.

<text>North Cape (; ) is a cape on the northern coast of the island of Magerøya in Northern Norway. The cape is in Nordkapp Municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The European route E69 motorway (highway) has its northern terminus at North Cape, which makes it the northernmost point in Europe that can be accessed by car and makes the E69 the northernmost public road in Europe. The plateau is a popular tourist attraction. The cape includes a with a large flat plateau on top, where visitors, weather permitting, can watch the midnight sun and views of the Barents Sea to the north. North Cape Hall, a visitor centre, was built in 1988 on the plateau. It includes a café, restaurant, post office, souvenir shop, a small museum, and video cinema.

==Geography==

The steep cliff of the North Cape is located at , about from the North Pole. Nordkapp is often inaccurately referred to as the northernmost point of Europe. However, the neighbouring Knivskjellodden Cape actually extends further north. Furthermore, both of these points are situated on an island (Magerøya), albeit one connected by road to the mainland. The northernmost point of mainland Europe is located at Cape Nordkinn () which lies about further south and about to the east. That point is located near the village of Mehamn on the Nordkinn Peninsula. The northernmost point of Europe including islands, is hundreds of kilometers further north, either in Russia&#x27;s Franz Josef Land or Norway&#x27;s Svalbard archipelago, depending on whether Franz Josef Land is considered to be in Europe or in Asia.

The North Cape is the point where the Norwegian Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean, meets the Barents Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean. The midnight sun can be seen from 14 May to 31 July. The sun reaches its lowest point between 12:14 am and 12:24 am (00:14 and 00:24) during those days.
==Transport==
The North Cape is reached by European route E69 highway through the North Cape Tunnel, an undersea tunnel connecting the island of Magerøya to the mainland. The EuroVelo bicycle routes EV1, EV7 and EV11 connect the North Cape to Sagres, Portugal, Malta and Athens, respectively.

Several cruise ships visit North Cape every year. Honningsvåg is one of the main stops of the Hurtigruten coastal ships.

Regular buses run from the nearby town of Honningsvåg to the North Cape (), and coaches meet the many cruise ships that call at the port of Honningsvåg.

The nearest airport is Honningsvåg Valan Airport (HVG), which offers several flights to and from Tromsø Langnes International Airport (TOS).

Road distance to North Cape from different towns with airports:
*Honningsvåg; 
*Lakselv; 
*Hammerfest; 
*Alta; 
*Kirkenes; 
*Tromsø; 

===Winter===
It is possible to visit North Cape during winter, but there is often heavy snow and wind and the last stretch of road is only open for convoys at certain times. The road to North Cape is kept open during winter and is accessible to regular vehicles and drivers who can cope with the snow and wind conditions that may occur in winter. Before this, E69 was the only winter-closed E-route in Europe.

==History==
The North Cape was named by the Englishman Steven Borough, captain of the &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot;, which sailed past in 1553 in search of the Northeast Passage.

===Early tourism===
The North Cape became a popular tourist destination during the last decades of the nineteenth century, especially after King Oscar II&#x27;s visit in 1873. Regular coastal steamer routes from Germany to Northern Norway established in this period facilitated these visits, and Thomas Cook &amp; Son began arranging tours to the destination as early as 1875. Tourists who climbed the cape would often do so using a path equipped with wired ropes from Hornviken. They would often celebrate the visit with the writing of postcards, so-called &quot;Cape cards&quot;, gazing at the midnight sun.

===Monuments and buildings===
A granite column was erected commemorating the visit of King Oscar II of Norway and Sweden in 1873 and the visit of German Kaiser Wilhelm II (in 1891) was also marked with a memorial. In 1891–92, an octagonal wooden building was erected on top of the cape, later named &quot;Stoppenbrinck&#x27;s&quot; (or &quot;Stoppenbrink&#x27;s&quot;) &quot;Champagne Pavilion&quot;.

===World War II===
In 1943, the Battle of the North Cape was fought in the Arctic Ocean off this cape, where the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was eventually sunk by gunfire from the British battleship HMS &quot;Duke of York&quot; and torpedoes from the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS &quot;Stord&quot;, and other ships of the British Navy.

===Road access===
A road to the North Cape was first built in 1956.

===Admission fee courtcase===
As of Q3 2022, the justice system has decided that money will not be charged for parking [on the parking lot] at North Cape; the government has won the case in the appellate court also; the defendant has appealed to the supreme court, as of Q3 2022. (The courtcase started in 2021.)

As of 2022, admission to North Cape visitor centre cost per adult [16 years and older] - and 90 for child between 7-years old and 15-years old. Often there is fog (since the plateau is above the common cloud base), which obscures the view. There is no discount for this situation, but the full price ticket is valid for multiple entries within 24 hours.

In 2000, and again in 2011, the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment responded to pressure from interest groups and asked Nordkapps VEL, the company that maintains the site, to reduce the admission fee to the plateau. Nordkapps VEL responded that the 8,000 daily visitors and distant location places great demands on the operations, maintenance, and security of the facilities and natural features of the large site. Visitors arriving by foot, bicycle, or other non-motorized vehicles are nowadays offered free entrance.

==Sport and leisure==
The 2009 Trans Europe Foot Race started in Bari, Italy and finished at North Cape. The total distance was .

The NorthCape4000 is a bicycle race that finishes at the North Cape. The total distance is around .

The first stage of the 2014 Arctic Race of Norway was held on North Cape on 14 August 2014. The bicycle race started in Hammerfest, finishing on North Cape and was won by Norwegian, Lars Petter Nordhaug for in a time of 4 hours 51 minutes 3 seconds.

&quot;Norge På Langs&quot; is a classic ski route, which stretches from Lindesnes, the most southerly tip of Norway to Nordkapp in the far north. The record of cycling this distance is 4 days, 22 hours, and 18 minutes which was performed by a group of five men from Rye in Oslo, in July 2003.

==In popular culture==
Footage from the North Cape is featured frequently in films and television, most notably in the 2014 action comedy film &quot;Børning&quot;, which revolves around an illegal street race from south of Oslo to the North Cape.

<text>Ólafsvík () is a small town in Iceland on the northern side of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. At one point in the 17th and 18th centuries, commercial vessels sailed between Ólafsvík and Denmark, and the village was one of the larger trading ports in Iceland. Ólafsvík became certified trading place, authorized by the Danish King and Danish authorities, in 1687.

It is situated near the western end of the Snæfellsnes peninsula, on the north coast of the peninsula. It is on route 54, between Grundarfjörður and Hellissandur. At 23 degrees 42 minutes West, it is the westernmost settlement of its size in Europe.

Administratively it is in the Western Region and it is the administrative centre of the municipality of Snæfellsbær which also includes the tiny villages of Arnarstapi, Hellnar, Rif and Hellissandur.

, it had 1,010 inhabitants.

==Overview==

Perhaps because of its situation on the bay of Breiðafjörður, the village was the first in Iceland to receive a commercial licence from the King of Denmark, in the 17th century. Ólafsvík&#x27;s economy is based on fishing industry and commerce, and provision of services for farmers in the area.

The area of Ólafsvík provides many opportunities for tourists, such as birdwatching, hiking trails, long sandy beaches, and snowmobiling on the Snæfellsjökull glacier, just 10 km away (although the road is closed for much of the year).

At nearby Hellissandur is the tallest structure in Western Europe, the Gufuskálar radio mast, 412 metres high.

<text>In philosophy and neuroscience, neuroethics is the study of both the ethics of neuroscience and the neuroscience of ethics. The ethics of neuroscience concerns the ethical, legal, and social impact of neuroscience, including the ways in which neurotechnology can be used to predict or alter human behavior and &quot;the implications of our mechanistic understanding of brain function for society... integrating neuroscientific knowledge with ethical and social thought&quot;.

Some neuroethics problems are not fundamentally different from those encountered in bioethics. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of free will, moral responsibility, self-deception, and personal identity. Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article .

The origin of the term &quot;neuroethics&quot; has occupied some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in &quot;References&quot; on page 9) claim &quot;neuroethics&quot; is a neologism that emerged only at the beginning of the 21st century, largely through the oral and written communications of ethicists and philosophers. According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled &quot;Neuro-ethics of &#x27;walking&#x27; in the newborn&quot; for the &quot;Perceptual and Motor Skills&quot;. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for &quot;Psychological Report&quot;, often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word &quot;neuroethics&quot;. Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford had used the term (see Cranford 1989). Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991. Writer William Safire is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as &quot;the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain&quot;.

==Two categories of problems==
Neuroethics encompasses the myriad ways in which developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as neuroscience develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we can do and those emerging from what we know.

In the first category are the ethical problems raised by advances in functional neuroimaging, psychopharmacology, brain implants and brain-machine interfaces. In the second category are the ethical problems raised by our growing understanding of the neural bases of behavior, personality, consciousness, and states of spiritual transcendence.

==Historical background and implications of neuroscience ethics==
Primitive societies for the most part lacked a system of neuroethics to guide them in facing the problems of mental illness and violence as civilization advanced. Trepanation led through a tortuous course to &quot;psychosurgery&quot;. Basic neuroscience research and psychosurgery advanced in the first half of the 20th century in tandem, but neuroscience ethics was left behind science and technology. Medical ethics in modern societies even in democratic governments, not to mention in authoritarian ones, has not kept pace with the advances of technology despite the announced social &quot;progress&quot;; and ethics continues to lag behind science in dealing with the problem of mental illness in association with human violence. Unprovoked &quot;pathological&quot; aggression persists, reminding us daily that civilization is a step away from relapsing into barbarism. Neuroscience ethics (neuroethics) must keep up with advances in neuroscience research and remain separate from state-imposed mandates to face this challenge.

A recent writer on the history of psychosurgery as it relates to neuroethics concludes: &quot;The lessons of history sagaciously reveal wherever the government has sought to alter medical ethics and enforce bureaucratic bioethics, the results have frequently vilified medical care and research. In the 20th century in both the communist USSR and Nazi Germany, medicine regressed after these authoritarian systems corrupted the ethics of the medical profession and forced it to descend to unprecedented barbarism. The Soviet psychiatrists&#x27; and Nazi doctors&#x27; dark descent into barbarism was a product of physicians willingly cooperating with the totalitarian state, purportedly in the name of the &quot;collective good&quot;, at the expense of their individual patients.&quot; This must be kept in mind when establishing new guidelines in neuroscience research and bioethics.

==Important activity since 2002 ==
There is no doubt that people were thinking and writing about the ethical implications of neuroscience for many years before the field adopted the label &quot;neuroethics&quot;, and some of this work remains of great relevance and value. However, the early 21st century saw a tremendous surge in interest concerning the ethics of neuroscience, as evidenced by numerous meetings, publications, and organizations dedicated to this topic.

In 2002, there were several meetings that drew together neuroscientists and ethicists to discuss neuroethics: the American Association for the Advancement of Science with the journal &quot;Neuron&quot;, the University of Pennsylvania, the Royal Society, Stanford University, and the Dana Foundation. This last meeting was the largest, and resulted in a book, &quot;Neuroethics: Mapping the Field&quot;, edited by Steven J. Marcus and published by Dana Press. That same year, the &quot;Economist&quot; ran a cover story entitled &quot;Open Your Mind: The Ethics of Brain Science&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; published the article &quot;Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience&quot;. Further articles appeared on neuroethics in &quot;Nature Neuroscience&quot;, &quot;Neuron&quot;, and &quot;Brain and Cognition&quot;.

Thereafter, the number of neuroethics meetings, symposia, and publications continued to grow. The over 38,000 members of the Society for Neuroscience recognized the importance of neuroethics by inaugurating an annual &quot;special lecture&quot; on the topic, first given by Donald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of Science Magazine. Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes. For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics Affinity Group, students at the London School of Economics established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network. Stanford began publishing the monthly Stanford Neuroethics Newsletter, Penn developed the informational website neuroethics.upenn.edu, and the Neuroethics and Law Blog was launched.

Several relevant books were published during this time as well: Sandra Ackerman&#x27;s &quot;Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today&quot; (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga&#x27;s &quot;The Ethical Brain&quot; (Dana Press), Judy Illes&#x27; edited volume, &quot;Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy&quot; (both Oxford University Press), Dai Rees and Steven Rose&#x27;s edited volume &quot;The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects&quot; (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose&#x27;s &quot;The Future of the Brain&quot; (Oxford University Press).

2006 marked the founding of the International Neuroethics Society (INS) (originally the Neuroethics Society), an international group of scholars, scientists, clinicians, and other professionals who share an interest in the social, legal, ethical and policy implications of advances in neuroscience. The mission of the International Neuroethics Society &quot;is to promote the development and responsible application of neuroscience through interdisciplinary and international research, education, outreach and public engagement for the benefit of people of all nations, ethnicities, and cultures&quot;. The first President of the INS was Steven Hyman (2006–2014), succeeded by Barbara Sahakian (2014–2016). Judy Illes is the current President, who like Hyman and Sahakian, was also a pioneer in the field of neuroethics and a founder member of the INS.

Over the next several years many centers for neurotics were established. A 2014 review of the field lists 31 centers and programs around the world; some of the longest-running include the Neuroethics Research Unit at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), the National Core for Neuroethics at the University of British Columbia in 2007, the Center for Neurotechnology Studies of the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, the Wellcome Centre for Neuroethics at the University of Oxford; and the Center for Neuroscience &amp; Society at the University of Pennsylvania.

Since 2017, neuroethics working groups across multiple organizations have published a spate of reports and guiding principles. In 2017, the Global Neuroethics Summit Delegates prepared a set of ethical questions to guide research in brain science, published in &quot;Neuron&quot;. In December 2018, The Neuroethics Working Group of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative proposed incorporating Neuroethics Guiding Principles into the research advanced by the Initiative. In December 2019, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) confirmed a set of neuroethics principles and recommendations; now this interdisciplinary group is developing a toolkit for implementation, moving from the theoretical to the practical. In early 2020, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) developed a neuroethical framework to facilitate the development of guidelines for engineers working on new neurotechnologies.

==Sources of information==
The books, articles and websites mentioned above are by no means a complete list of good neuroethics information sources. For example, readings and websites that focus on specific aspects of neuroethics, such as brain imaging or enhancement, are not included. Nor are more recent sources, such as Walter Glannon&#x27;s book &quot;Bioethics and the Brain&quot; (Oxford University Press) and his reader, entitled Defining Right and Wrong in Brain Science (Dana Press). We should also here mention a book that was in many ways ahead of its time, Robert Blank&#x27;s Brain Policy (published in 1999 by Georgetown University Press). The scholarly literature on neuroethics has grown so quickly that one cannot easily list all of the worthwhile articles, and several journals are now soliciting neuroethics submissions for publication, including the &quot;American Journal of Bioethics – Neuroscience&quot;, &quot;BioSocieties&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&quot;, and &quot;Neuroethics&quot;. The web now has many sites, blogs, and portals offering information about neuroethics. A list can be found at the end of this entry.

==Key issues==
Neuroethics encompasses a wide range of issues, which can only be sampled here. Some have close ties to traditional biomedical ethics, in that different versions of these issues can arise in connection with organ systems other than the brain.

===Brain interventions===
The ethics of neurocognitive enhancement, that is the use of drugs and other brain interventions to make normal people &quot;better than well&quot;, is an example of a neuroethical issue with both familiar and novel aspects. On the one hand, we can be informed by previous bioethical work on physical enhancements such as doping for strength in sports and the use of human growth hormone for normal boys of short stature. On the other hand, there are also some arguably novel ethical issues that arise in connection with brain enhancement, because these enhancements affect how people think and feel, thus raising the relatively new issues of &quot;cognitive liberty&quot;. The growing role of psychopharmacology in everyday life raises a number of ethical issues, for example the influence of drug marketing on our conceptions of mental health and normalcy, and the increasingly malleable sense of personal identity that results from what Peter D. Kramer called &quot;cosmetic psychopharmacology&quot;.

Nonpharmacologic methods of altering brain function are currently enjoying a period of rapid development, with a resurgence of psychosurgery for the treatment of medication refractory mental illnesses and promising new therapies for neurological and psychiatric illnesses based on deep brain stimulation as well as relatively noninvasive transcranial stimulation methods. Research on brain-machine interfaces is primarily in a preclinical phase but promises to enable thought-based control of computers and robots by paralyzed patients. As the tragic history of frontal lobotomy reminds us, permanent alteration of the brain cannot be undertaken lightly. Although nonpharmacologic brain interventions are exclusively aimed at therapeutic goals, the US military sponsors research in this general area (and more specifically in the use of transcranial direct current stimulation) that is presumably aimed at enhancing the capabilities of soldiers.

===Brain imaging===
In addition to the important issues of safety and incidental findings, mentioned above, some arise from the unprecedented and rapidly developing ability to correlate brain activation with psychological states and traits. One of the most widely discussed new applications of imaging is based on correlations between brain activity and intentional deception. Intentional deception can be thought of in the context of a lie detector. This means that scientists use brain imaging to look at certain parts of the brain during moments when a person is being deceptive. A number of different research groups have identified fMRI correlates of intentional deception in laboratory tasks, and despite the skepticism of many experts, the technique has already been commercialized. A more feasible application of brain imaging is &quot;neuromarketing&quot;, whereby people&#x27;s conscious or unconscious reaction to certain products can purportedly be measured.

Researchers are also finding brain imaging correlates of myriad psychological traits, including personality, intelligence, mental health vulnerabilities, attitudes toward particular ethnic groups, and predilection for violent crime. Unconscious racial attitudes may be manifest in brain activation. These capabilities of brain imaging, actual and potential, raise a number of ethical issues. The most obvious concern involves privacy. For example, employers, marketers, and the government all have a strong interest in knowing the abilities, personality, truthfulness and other mental contents of certain people. This raises the question of whether, when, and how to ensure the privacy of our own minds.

Another ethical problem is that brain scans are often viewed as more accurate and objective than in fact they are. Many layers of signal processing, statistical analysis and interpretation separate imaged brain activity from the psychological traits and states inferred from it. There is a danger that the public (including judges and juries, employers, insurers, etc.) will ignore these complexities and treat brain images as a kind of indisputable truth.

A related misconception is called neuro-realism: In its simplest form, this line of thought says that something is real because it can be measured with electronic equipment. A person who claims to have pain, or low libido, or unpleasant emotions is &quot;really&quot; sick if these symptoms are supported by a brain scan, and healthy or normal if correlates cannot be found in a brain scan. The case of phantom limbs demonstrate the inadequacy of this approach.

===Memory dampening===
While complete memory erasure is still an element of science-fiction, certain neurological drugs have been proven to dampen the strength and emotional association of a memory. Propranolol, an FDA-approved drug, has been suggested to effectively dull the painful effects of traumatic memories if taken within 6 hours after the event occurs. This has begun the discussion of ethical implications, assuming the technology for memory erasure will only improve.
Originally, propranolol was reserved for hypertension patients. However, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off-label purposes—leading to the question of whether they actually &quot;should&quot;. There are numerous reasons for skepticism; for one, it may prevent us from coming to terms with traumatic experiences, it may tamper with our identities and lead us to an artificial sense of happiness, demean the genuineness of human life, and/or encourage some to forget memories they are morally obligated to keep. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.

====Guidelines and legislation====

===Ethics of cognitive wetware===
===Cognitive diversity===

In general, cognitive diversity – or some &quot;optimum range of diversity&quot; – was found highly valuable. Science and technology such as gene editing technology may raise related ethical issues. There have also been speculations that cognitive enhancement technologies (CETs) may increase population-level cognitive diversity, e.g. as different people will choose to enhance different aspects of their cognition. Moral enhancement is also a topic in neuroethics.

===Stem cell therapy===
Most of the issues concerning the uses of stem cells in the brain are the same as any of the bioethical or purely ethical questions one will find regarding the use and research of stem cells. The field of stem cell research is a very new field that poses many ethical questions concerning the allocation of stem cells as well as their possible uses. Since most stem cell research is still in its preliminary phase, most of the neuroethical issues surrounding stem cells are the same as stem cell ethics in general.

More specifically the way that stem cell research has been involved in neuroscience is through the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. In these cases scientists are using neural stem cells to regenerate tissue and to be used as carriers for gene therapy. In general, neuroethics revolves around a cost benefit approach to find techniques and technologies that are most beneficial to patients. There has been progress in certain fields that have been shown to be beneficial when using stem cells to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

A study done in 2011 showed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to aid in Parkinson&#x27;s research and treatment. The cells can be used to study the progression of Parkinson&#x27;s as well as used in regenerative treatment. Animal studies have shown that the use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson&#x27;s. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes.

In another study done in 2011 used stem cells to treat cerebral palsy. This study, however, was not as successful as the Parkinson&#x27;s treatment. In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured in a way that mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their &quot;diseases&quot; are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they can not always be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area.

As discussed, stem cells are used to treat degenerative diseases. One form of a degenerative disease that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to &quot;attack&quot; its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system is multiple sclerosis. In this disease the body attacks the glial cells that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially &quot;short circuit&quot; and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially &quot;reprogramming&quot; their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoietic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient&#x27;s body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.

These are just some examples of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application in the field of neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.

The primary ethical dilemma that is brought up in stem cell research is concerning the source of embryonic stem cells (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, they come from the inner cell mass of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could have the potential to give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy? Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On the other end of the spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75–80% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses. This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled. Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.

=== Disorders of consciousness ===

Patients in coma, vegetative, or minimally conscious state pose ethical challenges. The patients are unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects of emotional processing, language comprehension, and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient. For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual&#x27;s conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states in a way that was never before possible. The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions.

===Pharmacological enhancement===

Cosmetic neuro-pharmacology, the use of drugs to improve cognition in normal healthy individuals, is highly controversial. Some case reports with the antidepressant Prozac indicated that patients seemed &quot;better than well&quot;, and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of these antidepressants. Opponents of cosmetic pharmacology believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher Arthur Caplan, state that it is an individual&#x27;s (rather than government&#x27;s, or physician&#x27;s) right to determine whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes. Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued that western medicine stands on the brink of a neuro-enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means. Jacob Appel, a Brown University bioethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers. The ethical concerns regarding pharmacological enhancement are not limited to Europe and North America; indeed, there is increasing attention given to cultural and regulatory contexts for this phenomenon, around the globe.

===Neuromarketing===
====Political neuromarketing====
The politics of neuromarketing is this idea of using advertisements to convince the mind of a voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger&#x27;s reforms or go back to the days of the recalled governor, Gray Davis. In normal marketing, voters would use &quot;detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor&quot;. However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, &quot;a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial clients in 2010&quot;. He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.

===Neurological treatments ===

Neuroscience has led to a deeper understanding of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new treatments are first being tested, the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in &quot;personal identity&quot;. Although this is a difficult ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of &quot;themselves&quot; such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the choice of patients. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient&#x27;s chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment. The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of neurology because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient&#x27;s way of life forever.

===Neuroscience and free will===
Neuroethics also encompasses the ethical issues raised by neuroscience as it affects our understanding of the world and of ourselves in the world. For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions? A crime in the United States requires a &quot;guilty act&quot; and a &quot;guilty mind&quot;. As neuropsychiatry evaluations have become more commonly used in the criminal justice system and neuroimaging technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control. The question of whether and how personal autonomy is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics. However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of &#x27;free will&#x27; or is a &#x27;moral-political&#x27; principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.

In late 2013 U.S. President Barack Obama made recommendations to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues as part of his $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. This Spring discussion resumed in a recent interview and article sponsored by Agence France-Presse (AFP): &quot;It is absolutely critical... to integrate ethics from the get-go into neuroscience research,&quot; and not &quot;for the first time after something has gone wrong&quot;, said Amy Gutmann, Bioethics Commission Chair.&quot; But no consensus has been reached. Miguel Faria, a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of Surgical Neurology International, who was not involved in the Commission&#x27;s work said, &quot;any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the Hippocratic Oath which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all&quot;. Why the danger of population-based bioethics? Faria asserts, &quot;it is centered on utilitarianism, monetary considerations, and the fiscal and political interests of the state, rather than committed to placing the interest of the individual patient or experimental subject above all other considerations&quot;. For her part, Gutmann believes the next step is &quot;to examine more deeply the ethical implications of neuroscience research and its effects on society&quot;.

<doc id="703007" wikidata="Q936114" url="?curid=703007" title="Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent">
<text>Edmund Grey, 1st Earl of Kent, [[Order of the Bath|KB]] (26 October 141622 May 1490), English administrator, nobleman and magnate, was the son of Sir John Grey, KG and Constance Holland. His main residence was at Wrest near Silsoe, Bedfordshire.

==Lineage==

Through Constance Holland, he was great-grandson of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, the third son of King Edward III of England, and thus grand-nephew of King Henry IV of England.

Grey succeeded his grandfather Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn in 1440.

He married Lady Katherine Percy, who was also a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt by his third wife, Katherine Swynford, and also a descendant of King Edward III of England through his second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence.

==Knighthood==

Edmund Grey was knighted following service in Aquitaine in October 1440. He attended the royal council between 1456 and 1458. Active militarily in the Wars of the Roses, he especially played a decisive role in the Battle of Northampton by switching his allegiance from the Lancastrian to the Yorkist cause. For this action he was rewarded by Edward IV with a grant of the manor of Ampthill, ownership of which had come into dispute between Grey, Ralph Lord Cromwell and Henry Holland, Duke of Exeter.

==Treasurer of England==

Edmund Grey&#x27;s appointment as treasurer of England was enacted at Westminster on 24 June 1463 but Walter Blount succeeded him in November 1464. Edmund also held other high offices under Edward IV and Richard III.

On 5 July 1483, he was made a Knight of the Bath. In 1485, he was constable of Northampton Castle.

==Earldom==

He was created Earl of Kent on 30 May 1465, shortly after the marriage of his eldest son, Anthony, to the king&#x27;s sister-in-law, Joan Woodville (she is sometimes known as Eleanor Woodville) He was then appointed chief justice of the county of Meryonnyth, North Wales and constable of Harlech. After the death of their first son, the second, George, became his heir and eventually George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent.

==Posterity==

His children by Katherine Percy included:
* Anthony Grey (died in his father&#x27;s lifetime), married Eleanor Woodville sister of Elizabeth Woodville. There were no children
* George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, married Anne Woodville then Katherine Herbert, daughter of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke
* Elizabeth Grey, married Sir Robert Greystoke
* Anne Grey, married John Grey, 8th Baron Grey of Wilton

<text>Larry King Monteith (August 17, 1933 – November 2, 2023) was an American electrical engineer and academic leader in North Carolina. He retired from North Carolina State University following a distinguished career of leadership positions, culminating with service as the university&#x27;s eleventh chancellor from 1989 to 1998.

In 1960, Monteith graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.S. in electrical engineering. He later earned a M.S. and Ph.D. from Duke University, also in electrical engineering.

After serving as a research scientist at the Solid State Laboratory of the Research Triangle Institute, Monteith joined the faculty of the NC State Department of Electrical Engineering in 1968. He was later appointed Department Head (1974) and Dean of Engineering (1978). As dean, Monteith led the engineering faculty to a top 30 ranking among all engineering schools in the nation and to a major increase in members of the National Academy of Engineering. Following the resignation of then-chancellor Bruce Poulton in 1989, Monteith was named interim chancellor, a position that he was thereafter named to on a permanent basis. He inherited an intercollegiate sports program in turmoil that had been recently penalized by the NCAA. By the time he completed his service as chancellor, the program was stable and graduation rates of student-athletes had increased dramatically.
In spite of difficult statewide budgetary conditions throughout his chancellorship, Monteith presided over a strong period of growth and advancement at NC State. The university&#x27;s research campus, the Centennial Campus, grew from a single building housing the university&#x27;s College of Textiles to a multi-tenant campus housing academic, corporate, and government researchers. Plans were developed then for a public golf course and executive center, as well as a new alumni building. Under Monteith&#x27;s leadership, the office of the provost (chief academic officer) underwent major changes, resulting in significant new responsibilities and power. Academic honor programs were also enhanced, with the addition of a First Year College, a chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, and the Park Scholarship program, a prestigious full-expense merit scholarship, similar to the Morehead Scholarship at sister institution UNC Chapel Hill. He led the transformation of the university library, dramatically improving its ranking among research libraries from next to last place to 32nd the year he left. In addition, the College of Management was established during his tenure and NC State also became the first Atlantic Coast Conference member to become accredited by the NCAA.

On his retirement, Monteith was succeeded as chancellor of NC State by Marye Anne Fox. The Engineering Graduate Research Center on Centennial Campus was renamed Monteith Research Center in his honor by the NC State Board of Trustees.

NC State Libraries Special Collections Research Center currently houses Larry King Monteith&#x27;s manuscript collection.

Monteith died on November 2, 2023, at the age of 90.

<text>Grundarfjörður () is a town in the north of the Snæfellsnes peninsula in the west of Iceland. It is situated between a mountain range and the sea. The nearby mountain Kirkjufell forms a small peninsula.

==Overview==
The town received the right to do commerce in 1786. Around 1800, French merchants came to Iceland and lived in Grundarfjörður, where they constructed a church and a hospital of their own. The town became wealthy through the fishing industry, and this wealth shows in the style of the original, luxurious houses being built.

The road to nearby Stykkishólmur crosses a lava field called &quot;Berserkjahraun&quot; . The name of the lava field comes from the Eyrbyggja saga, according to which two &quot;Berserkers&quot; were slain here by their master, because one of them fell in love with his master&#x27;s daughter.

==Twin town==
* Paimpol, Brittany. Grundarfjörður and Paimpol in Brittany in northwest France have strong historical connections. Between 1852 and 1935, Breton sailors from Paimpol and the surrounding region sailed to Iceland to catch cod. The connection between the two towns was sealed in a formal friendship and Grundarfjörður has been twinned with the Breton town Paimpol since 2004.

==Port and fisheries== 
Grundarfjörður&#x27;s harbor is one of the 10 largest quota-fishery harbors in the country with the biggest demersal catch in West Iceland being landed here.

== Tourism ==
Mount Kirkjufell lies to the west of the town. Other natural features include the Kirkjufellsfoss and Grundarfoss waterfalls.

The Saga Center Grundarfjörður hosts exhibits documenting the history of the town, including a display of photographs by photographer Bæring Cecilsson. To the south is the Grundarfjörður Church. Built in 1966, it hosts one of the 500 original lithographs of the Guðbrandsbiblía, the first book to be printed in Iceland.

== Arts &amp; Culture ==
Several outdoor art exhibits exist throughout the town. They include:

* Lúðvík Karlsson: A local folk artist whose stone sculptures number around 25, and can be found across the landscape. An art gallery and workshop at Sólvellir 6 displays more of his work.
* Sýn: A statue by Steinunn Thorarinsdottir located next to the Grundarfjörður Church, dedicated to fishermen in the community. 
* Orca Statue: The large herring population in the region means that the Snæfellsnes peninsula is the only location in the country where orcas are regularly seen. The Orca Statue pays an homage to this.
* Paimpol Cross: Historically, merchants from Paimpol traded in Grundarkampur, to the west of the town. The Paimpol Cross is erected here, commemorating Breton sailors who drowned.
* Umkringja: An exhibition of 5 photographs by Nina Zurier on a fish factory by the harbor.Grundarfjörður is home to an annual festival, known as

Annually, the town entertains &quot;Á Góðri Stund í Grundarfirði&quot; (Eng.: &quot;Good Times in Grundarfjörður&quot;), a festival which hosts exhibitions of art and music. Traditionally, locals will decorate their streets with a certain color, and dress up in clothes of the same color for the duration of the festival.

The college was founded in 1848 by a group of abolitionists who had left Kentucky because of their opposition to slavery and was originally named the Walnut Grove Academy. It was chartered in 1855. When the school was founded, it was the first school in Illinois (and only the third in the United States) to educate women on an equal basis with men. In 1856, Abraham Lincoln spoke on campus, making Eureka one of only three colleges where Lincoln spoke. Abingdon College merged with Eureka in 1885.

In 2010, Eureka College was designated as a national historic district by the National Park Service.

On March 27, 2009, the former leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, visited the section of the Berlin Wall on display in the Reagan Peace Garden on campus. Eureka gave President Gorbachev an honorary degree during a convocation in which students asked the former Soviet leader questions. The college granted Nancy Reagan an honorary degree in 2009 at a private ceremony in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

As part of the Ronald Reagan Centennial Celebration in 2011, former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich delivered the commencement address at Eureka. The same year saw the opening of the Mark R. Shenkman Reagan Research Center and College Archives; the center is collecting and maintaining every book and doctoral dissertation written about Ronald Reagan.

James A. Baker III was named Honorary Reagan Fellow in 2012, and this honor was bestowed on Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor the next year. George P. Shultz, former U.S. Secretary of State, received was made an Honorary Reagan Fellow at a ceremony in San Francisco in 2014.

==Campus==
The Eureka College campus is . Burrus Dickinson Hall, the college&#x27;s administration building, is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the college chapel.

The Ronald Reagan Museum and Peace Gardens, located within the Donald B. Cerf Center, contains a collection of objects and memorabilia largely donated by Reagan. The items are from his times as a student, actor, athlete, Governor of California and President of the United States. Admission is free.

The Reagan Athletic Complex was dedicated in 1970 by brothers and alumni Neil Reagan and Ronald Reagan, and named in their honor. At Eureka&#x27;s commencement exercises in 1982, President Reagan announced the START treaty proposal in the Reagan Gym. In 2015, The Bonati Fitness Center and Reagan Center Pool underwent renovation.

As of 2019, 23% of male students are in social fraternities, while 26% of female students are in social sororities. Overall 24% of the student body are involved in Greek life. In February 2020, the college&#x27;s chapter of Delta Sigma Phi was disciplined due to unknown allegations.

==Athletics==
The Eureka athletic teams are the Red Devils. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SLIAC) since the 2006–07 academic year. The Red Devils previously competed in the defunct Northern Illinois-Iowa Conference from about 1996–97 to 2005–06; and in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) until after the 1995–96 school year. Eureka was also a member of the Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) from 1910–11 to 1941–42.

==Notable alumni==

Among Eureka College&#x27;s alumni are forty-two college and university presidents, seven governors and members of U.S. Congress, and the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, who graduated with the class of 1932. Eureka College is the smallest college or university in American history to graduate a future U.S. president with a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

===Ronald Reagan===
Reagan&#x27;s relationship with his alma mater began in 1928 when he entered as a freshman from Dixon, Illinois, at age 17. Following his graduation on June 10, 1932, with a joint major in economics and sociology, Reagan returned for visits on twelve recorded occasions. He served on the board of trustees for three terms, stayed connected to his fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon, communicated with his football coach and mentor Ralph &quot;Mac&quot; McKinzie, and helped support fund-raising drives including with his own financial commitments to the college. Reagan gave three commencement addresses at Eureka College in 1952, 1957, 1982, and 1992. He dedicated the Melick Library building in 1967 and the Reagan Physical Education Center in 1970. When he died in 2004, Eureka College was one of three officially designated recipients of memorial gifts by his family. In 1982, President Reagan told the Eureka College audience, &quot;Everything that has been good in my life began here.&quot;

Eureka College established the Ronald W. Reagan Leadership Program in 1982 to provide scholarships and four-year full-tuition scholarships to designated Reagan Fellows.

<text>The yellow-fronted canary (Crithagra mozambica) is a small passerine bird in the finch family. It is sometimes known in aviculture as the green singing finch or the ‘’’green singer’’’.

The yellow-fronted canary was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Serinus&quot;, but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that genus to be polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the yellow-fronted canary were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Crithagra&quot; Swainson 1827.

This bird is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert. Its habitat is open woodland and cultivation. It nests in trees, laying three or four eggs in a compact cup nest. It has been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands, where it is found on western Hawaii, southeastern Oahu and Molokai.

The yellow-fronted canary is a common, gregarious seedeater. It is 11–13 cm in length. The adult male has a green back and brown wings and tail. The underparts and rump are yellow, and the head is yellow with a grey crown and nape and a black malar stripe. The female is similar, but with a weaker head pattern and duller underparts. Juveniles are greyer than the female, especially on the head.

Its song is a warbled &quot;zee-zeree-chereeo&quot;.

<text>Tokomaru Bay is a small beachside community on the remote East Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is 91 km north of Gisborne, on State Highway 35, and close to Mount Hikurangi. The district was originally known as &quot;Toka-a-Namu&quot;, which refers to the abundance of sandflies. Over the years the name was altered to &quot;Tokomaru Bay&quot;.

The two hapu or sub-tribes that reside in Tokomaru Bay are Te Whanau a Ruataupare and Te Whānau a Te Aotawarirangi. The ancestral mountain of Tokomaru Bay is Toiroa. The ancestral river is Mangahauini.

==History and culture==

The seven-kilometre wide bay is small but sheltered, and was a calling place for passenger ships until the early 20th century. Captain Cook spent time here on his 1769 journey of discovery, and later European settlement included a whaling station. A visit by missionaries William Williams, William Colenso, Richard Matthews and James Stack heralded the coming of Christianity to the district in 1838 and their crusade proved very successful with the local people.

The area around the bay has long been a Māori stronghold. The nearby pā at Te Mawhai was refortified by Henare Potae in the 1860s
during the battles between the Ngāti Porou and the warriors that followed the Pai Mārire movement (commonly known as Hauhau).

The town&#x27;s modern economy is mainly based on agriculture and forestry, with some tourism.

Tokomaru Bay&#x27;s population is predominantly Māori, with the area being a stronghold for the Ngāti Porou iwi.

Southern right whales sometimes come into bay to calve or rest.

<text>Tiny Toon Adventures is a platform video game for the NES. It was developed and published by Konami and released in 1991. It is the first &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; video game to be released for a video game console.

==Gameplay==

The player initially controls Buster Bunny in the effort to rescue Babs Bunny from her kidnapper, Montana Max (aka Monty). Before each world, the player can select an alternate character that they can switch into if they find a star ball. The three alternate characters are Dizzy Devil, Furrball, and Plucky Duck. Dizzy, Furrball, and Plucky have unique abilities that Buster lacks: Plucky can briefly fly and swim better than others, Dizzy can destroy walls and most enemies with his spin mode, and Furrball can climb many vertical surfaces, slowly sliding down them rather than plunging down. However, Buster can jump higher than others.

The first four worlds (The Hills, The Wetlands, The Trees, and Downtown) have three levels each while the remaining two worlds (Wackyland and Monty&#x27;s Mansion) only have one level. Aiding Buster is Hamton, who will give Buster an extra lives for 30 carrots each. The second level in each world concludes with an enclosed area where the player must avoid Elmyra and exit through the door; if the player is grabbed by Elmyra, they must start the world over. The third level in each world concludes with a boss battle.

==Reception==

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; had placed the game at 19th for March 1993 of their magazine regarding Top 20 NES games at that point.

<doc id="703035" wikidata="Q258212" url="?curid=703035" title="Near Eastern archaeology">
<text>Near Eastern archaeology is a regional branch of the wider, global discipline of archaeology. It refers generally to the excavation and study of artifacts and material culture of the Near East from antiquity to the recent past.

==Definition==
The definition of the Near East is usually based around West Asia, the Balkans, and North Africa, including the historical Fertile Crescent, the Levant, Anatolia, East Thrace and Egypt. The history of archaeological investigation in this region grew out of the 19th century discipline of biblical archaeology, efforts mostly by Europeans to uncover evidence for Christian biblical narratives. Much archaeological work in this region is still influenced by that discipline, although within the last three decades there has been a marked tendency by some archaeologists to dissociate their work from biblical frameworks.

The most common fields of study are biblical archaeology dealing with the region and history of the Bible; Assyriology dealing with Mesopotamia; Egyptology dealing with the history of Ancient Egypt; and prehistoric archaeology which is not tied to a region but instead deals with the origins of culture before the invention of writing.

==Geographic subdivisions==
===Egypt===
Egyptology is one example of a specialized branch that deals with the Nile Valley cultures of Egypt and associated regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Sinai Peninsula to the east, and parts of North Africa. It includes language studies, history and archaeology and other related disciplines. 

===Southern Levant===
The name Levant (or Syria-Palestine) is used to refer to the area adjacent to the east coast of the Mediterranean. The southern region included in this term encompasses Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and part of Jordan. Palestine was its ancient Roman and Byzantine name and was also in use during the Crusades (1095–1291), the period of Ottoman rule (1517-1917) and the British Mandate (1918–1948). The same region is also called the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, and Canaan. The foregoing names can be perceived as having political overtones, meaning that the more neutral, geographically based term the southern Levant has become popular with archaeologists who wish to refer to this area without prejudice or political orientation. In many contexts the Sinai Peninsula is also considered to be part of the southern Levant, although it is part of the modern state of Egypt. Archaeologically, it is distinguished from the heartland of Egypt, the Nile Valley and Delta.

===Northern Levant===
The term northern Levant can be used to refer to Lebanon, the Syrian littoral and portions of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey in the province of Hatay. These regions are often included in Greater Syria, a name used to refer to the whole area between Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia. The Mediterranean coast of Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, and parts of northern Israel are also known as Phoenicia, after the ancient kingdom. However, this term suffers from the same problems as Canaan and equivalents and so is generally now only used in a strict historical sense.

===Anatolia===
The peninsula of Anatolia, most of modern Turkey, is bordered by several seas and includes parts of Northern Mesopotamia. The Tigris and Euphrates rise in Turkey and flow south into Iraq.

===Cyprus===
Cyprus (ancient Alashiya), a large island in the eastern Mediterranean was a separate cultural entity during most periods of human occupation. However, its proximity to both Anatolia and the northern and southern Levant was responsible for influences from and to both these regions. This was especially the case as Cyprus was an important source of copper for much of the region.

===Mesopotamia===
Mesopotamia (&quot;The Land of Two Rivers&quot;) is considered to begin more or less near the modern border with Iraq and refers to the flat valley of the southern Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. These rivers empty into the Shatt al-Arab waterway that separates Iraq from Iran. Sumerology is a very specialized discipline that deals with the history, language and archaeology of ancient Sumer (southern Mesopotamia), mostly during the 4th and 3rd millennium BCE. Assyriology deals with the Assyrians who succeeded the Sumerians and covers much of the region while that language was still in use.

===Iran===
Iran, sometimes known as Persia, includes a large plateau and its periphery, including the Zagros Mountains. Sub-disciplines of this region deal mostly with the languages, history and archaeology of regions within this large area.

===Arabian Peninsula===
The Arabian Peninsula and its offshore islands is a separate geographical zone that has contacts with Sinai, the well-watered regions to the north, and by sea with the far-east.

==Organisations==
Due to the historic interest in the archaeology of the Near East, especially due to the biblical links of the area, there are a large number of organisations dedicated to the archaeological investigation of the region. These include the American Society of Overseas Research which publishes the journal &quot;Near Eastern Archaeology Magazine&quot;, the Council for British Research in the Levant which publishes the journal &quot;Levant&quot;, and the Netherlands Institute for the Near East which publishes the journal &quot;Bibliotheca Orientalis&quot;.

<text>Thomas Andrews Jr. (7 February 1873 – 15 April 1912) was a British businessman and shipbuilder, who was managing director and head of the drafting department of the shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Ireland. He was the naval architect in charge of the plans for the ocean liner &quot;Titanic&quot; and perished along with more than 1,500 people when the ship sank on her maiden voyage.

==Early life==

Thomas Andrews Jr. was born on 7 February 1873 at Ardara House, Comber, County Down, in Ireland, to The Rt. Hon. Thomas Andrews, a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and Eliza Pirrie. Andrews was a Presbyterian of Scottish descent and considered himself British. His siblings included J. M. Andrews, the future Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and Sir James Andrews, the future Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. Thomas Andrews lived with his family in Ardara, Comber. In 1884, he began attending the Royal Belfast Academical Institution until 1889 when, at the age of sixteen, he began a premium apprenticeship at Harland and Wolff where his uncle, the Viscount Pirrie, was part owner. Andrews&#x27; sharp wit and penchant for hard work had brought him prominence within his uncle&#x27;s company.

==Harland and Wolff==
At Harland and Wolff, Andrews began with three months in the joiners&#x27; shop, followed by a month in the cabinetmakers&#x27; and then a further two months working on the ships. The last eighteen months of his five-year apprenticeship were spent in the drawing office. Andrews worked tirelessly during the day and continued his studies in the evening hours. In 1901, boarding at 11 Wellington Place, after working in the many departments of the company, he was deeply involved in the construction of White Star&#x27;s ocean liners and was serving as Assistant Shipyard Manager and was later appointed Manager of the Construction Works. That same year, he also became a member of the Institution of Naval Architects. By 1907, he had been appointed the Managing Director of Harland and Wolff and began to oversee the plans for three new ocean liners for the White Star Line: , and RMS (later HMHS) . All three ships were designed by Andrews, William Pirrie and general manager Alexander Carlisle to be the largest, safest and most luxurious ships at sea. He was intimately connected with the design of &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;. By that point, Andrews had earned a reputation as a genius in the field of ship design. Andrews usually referred to his position as that of a &quot;shipbuilder&quot; or a &quot;director&quot; of the shipbuilding firm he worked at, rather than claiming the more formal title of &quot;Naval Architect&quot;. During his long years of apprenticeship, study, and work, Andrews had become well-loved in the company and amongst the shipyard&#x27;s employees. Andrews was a tireless worker; he frequently showed up at the shipyard at any time. He was always willing to pitch in and lend a hand at some physically demanding work task as the need arose. He was known to have shared his lunch with fellow workers when the need came up. Even so, Andrews was not afraid to correct workers when he saw them doing something the wrong way or breaking shipyard rules. It was said that while he wouldn&#x27;t fire a worker when he found him in the middle of some such nonsense, he would give the worker &quot;the rough side of his tongue and a friendly caution.&quot; He also enjoyed it when workers did more than just mindlessly plug away at their tasks - he encouraged them to put their minds into it. Andrews was willing to listen to input from workers who thought they had a better way to do something. Well-documented sources seemed to describe him as cheery, optimistic, and generous. One yard foreman recalled that it &quot;seemed his delight to make those around him happy. His was ever the friendly greeting and the warm handshake and kind disposition&quot; and one co-worker described him as &quot;diligent to the point of strenuousness&quot;.

==Family==

On 24 June 1908, Andrews married Helen Reilly Barbour, daughter of textile industrialist John Doherty Barbour and sister to the politician Sir John Milne Barbour, known as &quot;Milne&quot;. The couple honeymooned in Switzerland and lived at Dunallan, 12 Windsor Avenue, Belfast, now numbered 20, and worshipped at First Presbyterian Church on Rosemary Street. Their daughter, Elizabeth Law-Barbour Andrews (known by her initials, &quot;ELBA&quot;), was born on 27 November 1910. It is known that Andrews took Helen to view the &quot;Titanic&quot; one night, shortly before Elizabeth was born. Elizabeth died in 1973 at age 62 following a car accident. He was always willing to acknowledge the hard work of other people, and his wife recalled that he had of himself &quot;the humblest opinion of anyone I ever knew.&quot; During the maiden voyage of , Andrews and Ismay made selected notes on what could be improved upon &quot;Titanic&quot;. Andrews suffered from varicose veins in his legs. According to stewardess Violet Jessop, during the voyage of , some crew members presented him with a very handsome walking stick; the crew were grateful for his ongoing efforts in making their accommodations more comfortable. She even felt that, in some way, Andrews managed to impact some of his positive personality into the ships he had designed and helped build.

==RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;==

Andrews also headed a group of Harland and Wolff workers called the guarantee group, who went on the maiden voyages of their ships in order to observe ship operations and spot any necessary improvements. &quot;Titanic&quot; was no exception, so Andrews and the rest of his Harland and Wolff group travelled from Belfast on &quot;Titanic&quot; for her sea trials on 2 April 1912. He had been assigned to head up the builder&#x27;s delegation during the trials. He was accompanied by Edward Wilding and yard employees. He was booked in First Class and would occupy cabin A-36. At the time of the departure from Belfast, Andrews&#x27; father was ill and his wife Helen had not been well, either. Andrews wrote a quick line to his wife: &quot;Just a line to let you know that we got away this morning in fine style and have had a very satisfactory trial. We are getting more ship-shape every hour, but there is still a great deal to be done.&quot; According to Edward Wilding, when the ship made its way to Southampton, Andrews &quot;ceaselessly employed going round with representatives of the owners and of the Firm, in taking notes and preparing reports of work still to be done.&quot; Andrews did find time to eat, as Saloon Steward Frederick Ray, who had served him previously on , was assigned to wait on Andrews&#x27; table during the trip down to Southampton. At Southampton, Andrews was up early on April 4, left the South Western Hotel where he was staying, and spent the day &quot;with managers and foremen putting work in hand&quot;. Andrews and others coordinated in order to help finish the ship by Tuesday night. On Thursday evening, he wrote to his wife, &quot;I wired you this morning of our safe arrival after a very satisfactory trip. The weather was good and everyone most pleasant. I think the ship will clean up all right before sailing on Wednesday.&quot; Andrews went on to mention that Lord Pirrie&#x27;s doctors had refused to allow him to make the maiden voyage. From that point on, Andrews was constantly busy. Andrews&#x27; secretary, Thompson Hamilton, wrote of Andrews&#x27; activities at Southampton, that he &quot;was never for a moment idle. He generally left his hotel about 8:30 for the offices, where he dealt with his correspondence, then went on board until 6:30, where he would return to the offices to sign letters. During the day I took to the ship any urgent papers and he always dealt with them no matter what his business. He would himself put in their place such things as racks, tables, chairs, berth ladders, electric fans, saying that except he saw everything right he could not be satisfied.&quot; On April 9, Andrews wrote to his wife, &quot;The &quot;Titanic&quot; is now about complete and will I think do the old Firm credit to-morrow when we sail.&quot;

On 10 April, Andrews boarded the ship, having left his room at the South Western Hotel. Immediately upon boarding, he began a thorough inspection. He was pleased with what he found, it was said. &quot;Titanic&quot; began her maiden voyage from Southampton. Before departure, Andrews took the opportunity to say goodbye to Thomas Hamilton and others were not to be accompanying the ship on the voyage. His spirits were high and he said, &quot;Remember now and keep Mrs Andrews informed of any news of the vessel&quot;. When the ship nearly collided with the liner , Andrews thought that the situation was &quot;decidedly unpleasant&quot;. A few hours later, the &quot;Titanic&quot; called at Cherbourg Harbour in north-western France, and Andrews wrote to his wife, &quot;We reached here in nice time and took on board quite a number of passengers...the weather is fine and everything shaping for a good voyage.&quot; After departing Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, Andrews, at a dining table, mentioned that in certain ways, the ship was not ready to sail but they had to proceed because the prescheduled sailing date of April 10 arrived and the ship simply had to sail on time. On April 11, Third Class Steward John E. Hart recalled that at some point during the day, there was a general bulkhead inspection. He saw Andrews and Chief Officer Henry Tingle Wilde checking to make sure that the crew would close the watertight doors manually. Andrews&#x27; bedroom steward, Henry Etches, noticed that Andrews &quot;was working all the time&quot; taking notes on various improvements he felt were needed, primarily cosmetic changes to various facilities. Jessop said that Andrews &quot;never failed to stop for a cheerful word, his only regret that we were &quot;getting further from home&quot;.&quot; On the night of April 12, stewardess Mary Sloan conversed with Andrews in the Grand Staircase and noted Dr William Francis Norman O&#x27;Loughlin note Andrews seemed &quot;loth to go, he wanted to talk about home; he was telling me his father was ill and Mrs Andrews was not so well...he said...he did not like (that the ship) was taking us further away from home...his face struck me as having a very sad expression&quot;. However, on the night of 14 April, Sloan felt Andrews was in &quot;good spirits&quot;. Eleanor Cassebeer put on a stunning gown and arrived at the Purser&#x27;s table, which she shared with Dr O&#x27;Loughlin and Andrews, a chipper Andrews let out a friendly little cheer for her choice, then he leaned over to her and said, &quot;Now that&#x27;s the way a lady should look!&quot; Albert Dick and his wife Vera had grown attached to Andrews and noticed that &quot;upon every occasion, and especially at dinner on Sunday evening, he talked almost constantly about his wife, little girl, mother and family, as well as of his home&quot;. After dinner, Andrews made his way aft &quot;to thank the baker for some special bread he had made for him&quot; and returned to his stateroom to make calculations and drawings for future use. Andrews reportedly remarked to a friend that &quot;Titanic&quot; was &quot;as nearly perfect as human brains can make her.&quot;

At 11:40 PM, &quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg on the ship&#x27;s starboard side. Eleanor Cassebeer may have been the first witness to see Andrews after the collision and said that he &quot;assured everybody that we were absolutely safe, and that the &quot;Titanic&quot; was absolutely unsinkable. He said that she could break in three separate and distinct parts and that each part would stay afloat indefinitely&quot;; Andrews may have felt the collision and immediately went out on deck to investigate for himself, moving forward along A Deck. He may have seen the iceberg as it faded in the distance astern. Albert and Vera Dick saw Andrews who said &quot;that he was going below to investigate...he knew the ship as no one else did and that he might be able to allay the fear of the passengers&quot;. Saloon Steward James Johnstone saw Andrews race down to E Deck, seemingly heading towards the Engine Room, to help examine the damage; he reassured some First Class Ladies. Johnstone saw Andrews come back up to D Deck and head towards the mail room. Stewardess Annie Robinson saw him on E Deck, heading towards the Mail Room with a mail clerk and Chief Purser Hugh McElroy. She saw Andrews come back with Captain Edward J. Smith and overheard Andrews saying, &quot;Well, three have gone already, Captain&quot;; Smith and Andrews separated, with Smith heading up to the bridge, while Andrews stayed below to continue his inspection. Andrews determined that the first five of the ship&#x27;s sixteen watertight compartments were rapidly flooding, more than the four that the vessel was supposed to withstand. He was seen by First Class passenger Anna Warren rushing up the Grand Staircase on D Deck, taking the steps three at a time, with a &quot;look of terror&quot; on his face. Passenger William Sloper saw Andrews rushing up the staircase on A Deck, hurrying towards the bridge, &quot;worried&quot;. Albert and Vera Dick were told by Andrews, &quot;There is no cause for any excitement. All of you get what you can in the way of clothes and come on deck as soon as your can. She is torn to bits below, but she will not sink if her after bulkheads hold&quot;. Andrews may have relayed the information to Captain Smith on the bridge, adding that in his opinion, the vessel had only about an hour and a half before foundering. He and Smith had to have realised the severe shortage of lifeboats on board the ship.

As the evacuation began, Andrews appears to have gone below deck in order to help prepare passengers for evacuation. He may have told George Rheims and his brother-in-law Joseph Loring to put their lifebelts on, and continued down onto A Deck, where he helped crewmembers who were trying to get passengers roused, dressed and up on deck with their lifebelts on. He came upon Stewardess Annie Robinson and told her, &quot;Put on your lifebelt and walk about and let the passengers see you.&quot; When she protested, &quot;It looks rather mean.&quot; Andrews firmly replied, &quot;No, put it on&quot;, and added, &quot;Well, if you value your life put your belt on.&quot; Mary Sloan said that he &quot;here, there and everywhere, looking after everybody, telling the women to put on lifebelts, telling the stewardesses to hurry the women up to the boats, all about everywhere, thinking of everyone but himself.&quot; Etches bumped into Andrews who asked if he had awakened all of his passengers. Andrews told Etches to follow him down the Pantry stairs to C Deck, and began to instruct Etches to &quot;be sure and make the passengers open their doors, and to tell them the lifebelts were on top of the wardrobes and on top of the racks&quot;, as well as to assist them in every way that the steward could, which Etches endeavoured to follow through on. Before parting, Andrews said that Etches should make sure no lifebelts were left in the cabins. Etches re-joined Andrews on C Deck, and proceeded to the first class entrance and forward grand staircase. When Chief Purser McElroy told them he wanted passengers to put lifebelts on, Andrews said, &quot;That is exactly what I have been trying to get them to do&quot;; he left to go down the stairs to D Deck.
Andrews and Ismay were present at the launch of Boat No.7, and they moved on to help at boat No.5. Fully aware of the short time the ship had left and of the lack of lifeboat space for all passengers and crew, he urged people into the lifeboats in the hope of filling them with as many people as possible. He motioned Eleanor Cassebeer into Boat No.5; when asked why he did not get in, he replied, &quot;No, women and children first&quot;. John and John &quot;Jack&quot; Borland Thayer III ran into Andrews; the father asked Andrews what the situation was; Andrews replied quietly that he did not give the ship &quot;much over an hour to live&quot;. &quot;Titanic&quot; sank at 2:20 a.m, on April 15. Andrews perished along with more than 1,500 others; his body was never recovered.

===Death===
Andrews was reportedly last seen by an assistant steward, named by some sources as steward John Stewart, after approximately 2:05 a.m.; Andrews was standing alone in the 1st-class smoking room, his arms folded and lifebelt lying on a nearby table. The steward asked Andrews, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you going to have a try for it, Mr. Andrews?&quot; Andrews did not answer or move, &quot;just stood like one stunned&quot;. In his 1955 book &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, Walter Lord suggested that Andrews was staring at a Norman Wilkinson painting over the fireplace that depicted the entrance to Plymouth Sound, which &quot;Titanic&quot; had been expected to visit on her return voyage. The sighting of Andrews in the smoking room became one of the most famous stories of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster – published in a 1912 book, &quot;Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder&quot; by Shan Bullock, and thereby perpetuated – and led to popular belief that Andrews may have made no attempt to escape and awaited his end in the smoking room.

However, there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that Stewart had left the ship in lifeboat No. 15 at approximately 1:40 a.m., 40 minutes before the ship sank. In &quot;Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder&quot;, Bullock even suggested that Andrews likely stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then continued assisting with the evacuation, and discussed several other later sightings of Andrews. This is further corroborated by a private letter written by Andrews&#x27; friend David Galloway to Lord Pirrie; Galloway interviewed crewmembers to see if they had any information on Andrews&#x27; fate. An unnamed officer reportedly saw Andrews throwing deck chairs overboard for people to use as floatation devices. Mary Sloan, a stewardess on the ship, said that Andrews persuaded her to enter a lifeboat, saying &quot;Ladies you must get in at once! You cannot pick and choose your boat! Don&#x27;t hesitate, get in at once, and Get in!&quot; Bullock placed this event at 2:05 a.m.. Andrews was also reportedly seen, carrying a lifebelt, possibly the lifebelt from the smoking room, heading to the bridge, perhaps to search for Captain Smith. Mess steward Cecil Fitzpatrick claimed to have seen Andrews and Captain Smith together on the bridge just a few minutes before the ship began its final plunge, and that both men put on lifebelts; Smith told Andrews, &quot;We cannot stay any longer; she is going!&quot; Fitzpatrick saw Andrews and Smith both jump overboard just as the water reached the bridge.

==Legacy==
Violet Jessop said that while on the Carpathia, she had searched for Andrews but found he was among the missing when the roll was called. On 19 April 1912, his father received a telegram from his mother&#x27;s cousin, who had spoken with survivors in New York: &quot;INTERVIEW WITH TITANIC&#x27;S OFFICERS. ALL UNANIMOUS THAT ANDREWS DIED A HEROIC DEATH, THINKING ONLY OF OTHER&#x27;S SAFETY. EXTEND HEARTFELT SYMPATHY TO ALL.&quot;

Newspaper accounts of the disaster labelled Andrews a hero. Mary Sloan later wrote in a letter: &quot;Mr. Andrews met his fate like a true hero, realising the great danger, and gave up his life to save the women and children of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. They will find it hard to replace him.&quot; A short biography, &quot;Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder&quot;, was produced within the year by Shan Bullock at the request of Sir Horace Plunkett, a member of Parliament, who felt that Andrews&#x27; life was worthy of being memorialised.

In his home town, Comber, one of the earliest and most substantial memorials for a single victim of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster was built. The Thomas Andrews Jr. Memorial Hall was opened in January 1914. The architects were Young and McKenzie with sculpted work by the artist Sophia Rosamond Praeger. The hall is now maintained by the South Eastern Education Board and used by The Andrews Memorial Primary School. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque is located on his house in Windsor Avenue, Belfast.
The remains the sole surviving ship designed by Andrews.

Asteroid 245158 Thomasandrews was named in his honour in 2004.

<text>The Chevrolet El Camino is a coupé utility vehicle that was produced by Chevrolet between 1959–1960 and 1964–1987. Unlike a standard pickup truck, the El Camino was adapted from the standard two-door Chevrolet station wagon platform and integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body.

Introduced in the 1959 model year in response to the success of the Ford Ranchero coupé utility, its first run, based on the Biscayne&#x27;s B-body, lasted only two years. Production resumed for the 1964–1977 model years based on the Chevelle platform, and continued for the 1978–1987 model years based on the GM G-body platform.

Although based on corresponding General Motors car lines, the vehicle is classified in the United States as a pickup. GMC&#x27;s badge engineered El Camino variant, the Sprint, was introduced for the 1971 model year. Renamed Caballero in 1978, it was also produced through the 1987 model year.

==Background==
The concept of a two-door vehicle based on a passenger car chassis with a tray at the rear began in the United States in the 1920s with the roadster utility (also called &quot;roadster pickup&quot; or &quot;light delivery&quot;) models.

Ford Australia was the first company to produce a coupé utility as a result of a 1932 letter from the wife of a farmer in Victoria, Australia, asking for &quot;a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays&quot;. Ford designer Lew Bandt developed a suitable solution, and the first coupé utility model was released in 1934. Bandt went on to manage Ford&#x27;s Advanced Design Department, being responsible for the body engineering of the XP, XT, XW, and XA series Ford Falcon utilities. General Motors’ Australian subsidiary Holden also produced a Chevrolet coupé utility in 1935, and Studebaker produced the Coupé Express from 1937 to 1939. The body style did not reappear on the American market until the release of the 1957 Ford Ranchero.

Both the coupé utility and the similar open-topped roadster utility continued in production, but the improving economy of the mid- to late-1930s and the desire for improved comfort saw coupé utility sales climb at the expense of the roadster utility until, by 1939, the latter was all but a fading memory.

In 1957, Ford introduced the Ranchero, and established a new market segment in the U.S. of an automobile platform based coupé utility. In 1959, Chevrolet responded with the El Camino to compete with Ford&#x27;s full-sized Ranchero. The original El Camino and Ranchero would compete directly only in the 1959 model year.
==First generation (1959–1960)==
===1959===
The El Camino was introduced for the 1959 model year two years after the Ford Ranchero. According to Chevrolet stylist Chuck Jordan, GM Harley Earl had suggested a coupé pickup in 1952.

Like the Ranchero, it was based on an existing and modified platform, the new-for-1959 Brookwood two-door station wagon, itself based on the redesigned full-sized Chevrolet of that year. Highly stylized, it initially sold 50% more briskly than the more conservative Ranchero, some 22,000 to 14,000.

Unlike the Brookwood wagon and a sedan delivery variant, the El Camino was available with any full-sized Chevrolet drivetrain. It came in a single trim level, its exterior using the mid-level Bel-Air&#x27;s trim, and the interior of the low-end Biscayne. Its chassis featured Chevrolet&#x27;s &quot;Safety-Girder&quot; X-frame design and a full-coil suspension, both introduced in the 1958 model year. The wheel-base was longer, and overall length for all 1959 Chevrolets was up to . The El Camino&#x27;s payload rating ranged from , with gross vehicle weights ranging from depending on powertrain and suspension. The somewhat soft passenger car suspension of the base model left the vehicle level without a load, in contrast the Ranchero, where standard 1100-pound rated heavy duty rear springs gave it a distinct rake when empty. The quirky Level Air suspension option, in its second and final year, was listed as available, but was almost never seen on any Chevrolet model, much less an El Camino. The 1959 El Camino was promoted as the first Chevrolet pickup built with a steel bed floor instead of wood. The floor was a corrugated sheetmetal insert, secured with 26 recessed bolts. Concealed beneath it was the floor pan from the Brookwood two-door wagon, complete with foot wells. Box capacity was almost .

Among the performance engines offered were a 283-cid Turbo-Fire V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion, several Turbo-Thrust 348-cid V8s with four-barrel or triple two-barrel carburetors producing , and 250- and 290-bhp 283-cube Ramjet Fuel Injection V8s.

&quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine conducted a test of an El Camino equipped with the hottest powertrain combination available in early 1959—a , triple-carb, solid-lifter 348 V8 mated to a four-speed. Staff testers clocked 0-60 mph times of around seven seconds, estimated top speed at , and predicted 14-second/100-mph quarter-mile performance with a rear-axle ratio suitable for drag racing installed.

A total of 22,246 El Caminos were produced for 1959. That bested the count of 21,706 first-year Rancheros made in 1957 and the 14,169 Ford sedan pickups built in direct competition for the 1959 model year.

===1960===
The similar but less flamboyant 1960 model started at $2366 for the six-cylinder model; another $107 for a V8 with the two-barrel 283. At first glance, the exterior once again had a Bel Air look, with that series&#x27; bright-metal &quot;jet&quot; appliqué and narrow trailing molding used to accent the rear quarters. Inside, Biscayne/Brookwood appointments also persisted. The seat was now covered in striped-pattern cloth with vinyl facings. Available interior trim shades were once again gray, blue, and green. Floor coverings were in medium-tone vinyl. Mid-1959 powertrain availability was carried over with minimal changes for 1960: The base 283-cid V8 was detuned a bit for fuel economy and was now rated at , and the fuel-injected engines were officially gone.

Orders plummeted by a third, to just 14,163, at which point Chevrolet discontinued the model; meanwhile, Ford moved 21,027 Rancheros, which were now based on the brand-new Falcon compact. The pioneering American sedan pickups just did not connect with enough car-buying Americans. Perhaps these early &quot;crossovers&quot; didn&#x27;t carry enough passengers; in a time when baby-boomer families dominated the market, three across was the best they could offer. Cargo volume was meager compared with pickup trucks. The low-level trim and marketing efforts focused almost exclusively on commercial customers may have inhibited sales, as well.

Between the discontinuation of the first generation and the introduction of the second, the Chevrolet Greenbrier, based on the Corvair platform, replaced the El Camino as Chevrolet’s car-based pickup.


==Second generation (1964–1967)==
Chevrolet reintroduced the El Camino four years later based on the mid-size Chevrolet Chevelle. The 1964 model was similar to the Chevelle two-door wagon forward of the B-pillars and carried both &quot;Chevelle&quot; and &quot;El Camino&quot; badges, but Chevrolet marketed the vehicle as a utility model and the Chevelle&#x27;s most powerful engines were not available. Initial engine offerings included six-cylinder engines of 194 and 230 cubic inches with horsepower ratings of , respectively. The standard V8 was a 283 cubic-inch Chevrolet small block with two-barrel carburetor and with optional engines including a 283 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Added to the El Camino&#x27;s option list during the course of the 1964 model year were two versions of the 327 cubic-inch small block V8 rated at —the latter featuring a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, larger four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. El Caminos also featured Air shocks in the rear, as well as fully boxed frames. The shocks were continued over all generations, the frames only thru 1967.

===1965===
The 1965 El Camino received the same facelift as the 1965 Chevelle, with a more pronounced V-shaped front end, and a higher performance L79 version of the 327 engine rated at that was also available in Chevelles. Most of the other engines were carried over from 1964, including the 194 and 230 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift sixes, the 283 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8 and 327 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8s of .

===1966===
In 1966, GM added a V8 engine to the lineup rated from 325 to . The 1965 327 would run low 15s in the 1/4 mile (at some 90 mph), while 1966 to 1969 models were easily into the mid- to upper-14s. New sheetmetal highlighted the 1966 El Camino, identical to the Chevelle. A new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer was featured. Inside, the standard version featured a bench seat interior and rubber floor mat from the low-line Chevelle 300 series, while the Custom used a more upscale interior from the Chevelle Malibu with plusher cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. A tachometer was optional.

===1967===
The 1967 El Camino followed the Chevelle&#x27;s styling facelift with a new grille, front bumper, and trim. Air shocks remained standard equipment on the El Camino, allowing the driver to compensate for a load. The 1967 model year also brought the collapsible steering column and options of disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission. It was the second year the 396 (L35, L34, and L78) could be had in the El Camino (both 13480 300 Deluxe base and 13680 Malibu series). Since the L35 396/325 hp engine was the base for the SS396 series, the number of L35 engines reported sold by Chevrolet in 1967 (2,565) were sold in one of the two El Camino series, which were the only other series the engine could be ordered in. Since the L34 () &amp; L78 () were available in either El Camino series as well as the two SS396 body styles, there is no way of knowing how many of these optional engines went to which body style. Chevrolet does report 17,176 L34 and 612 L78 engine options were sold in 1967 Chevelles, but there is no breakdown of body styles. The TH400 3-speed automatic was now available as an option (RPO M40) with the 396 engine in both the SS396 series and the 396-equipped El Caminos. The 3-speed manual transmission remained the standard transmission with a heavy duty (RPO M13) also available along with the 2-speed Powerglide and either M20 wide ratio or M21 close ratio 4-speed transmissions. Although there was no actual factory El Camino Super Sport until 1968, many owners have &quot;cloned&quot; &#x27;67 SS396s using 1967 Chevelle SS396 badges and trim.


==Third generation (1968–1972)==
===1968–1969===
Chevrolet introduced a longer El Camino in 1968, based on the Chevelle station wagon/four-door sedan wheelbase (, overall length: ); it also shared Chevelle Malibu exterior and interior trims. The interior was revamped including cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. All-vinyl Strato bucket seats and center console were an $111 option. Power front disc brakes and Positraction were optional. A new, high-performance Super Sport SS396 version was launched. The Turbo-Jet 396 was offered in or versions. Returning to the official options list for the first time since late 1966 was the L78. It had solid lifters, big-port heads, and an 800 cfm Holley four-barrel on a low-rise aluminum manifold. A three-speed manual was standard with all engines, and a four-speed or automatic was optional.
In 1968, the SS was a separate model (the &quot;SS-396&quot;).

The 1969 models showed only minor changes, led by more-rounded front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. For the first time, the Chevrolet 350 V8 was used in an El Camino. The Super Sport group included a 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem. More potent editions of the 396 engine, developing also made the options list. Options included power windows and locks. Curiously, back-up lights moved from the rear bumper to the tailgate, where they were ineffective when the gate was down.

===1970===
The 1970 models received sheet metal revisions that gave the bodies a more squared-up stance, and interiors were also redesigned.
The new SS396, which actually displaced (although all emblems read 396) was available. Chevrolet&#x27;s largest and most-powerful engine of the time was also put into a select few El Caminos. The LS6 454 CID engine, rated at and of torque, gave the El Camino 1/4-mile times in the upper 13-second range at around .

===1971–1972===
The 1971 El Camino got fresh front-end styling (again shared with the Chevelle) that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. For 1971, mandated lower-octane unleaded fuel necessitated a reduction in engine compression, and GM&#x27;s A.I.R. system, a &quot;smog pump&quot;, was added to control tailpipe emissions. Power and performance were reduced. Engine offerings for 1971 included the 250-6, small-block V8s of 307 and 350 cubic inches; and big block V8s of 402 and 454-cubic-inch displacements. Horsepower ratings of those engines for 1971 ranged from 145 for the six to 365 for the RPO LS5 454 – all in gross figures. The LS6 454 V8 was gone forever. A rebadged El Camino, the GMC Sprint debuted in 1971. It shared the same engine and transmission offerings as its Chevrolet counterpart.

The 1972 El Caminos wore single-unit parking and side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille, but little changed. For 1972, horsepower measurements were switched to the &quot;net&quot; figures as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emission controls hooked up. Engine offerings included the 250-6, a 307 V8, a 350-cubic-inch V8, and big block V8s of 402 and 454 cubic-inch displacements. The 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396) produced ; the 454 managed to put out under the net rating system. Super Sport equipment could now be ordered with any V8 engine, including the base 307-cubic-inch version. All 1972 El Caminos with the 454 ci engine have a &quot;W&quot; as the fifth digit in the VIN, and the 454 was only available with Super Sport trim.


==Fourth generation (1973–1977)==
===1973–1975===
For 1973, the El Camino was redesigned. Matching the Chevelle line and using the wagon chassis, it was the largest El Camino generation. Energy-absorbing hydraulic front bumper systems on these vehicles added more weight. There were two different trim levels of El Caminos during this period. The base model and SS option shared interior and exterior appointments with the Chevelle Malibu, while the El Camino Classic (introduced for 1974) shared its trim with the more upscale Chevelle Malibu Classic.

The chassis design was as new as the bodies with a wider wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right, which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car&#x27;s weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all &#x27;73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger fuel tank, and &quot;flush and dry&quot; rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster. A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility to which the unusually thin windshield pillars contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams. El Caminos shared the &quot;Colonnade&quot; frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well.

The 307 2-barrel V8 with was the base engine. Options included a 350 2-barrel V8 with , a 350 4-barrel V8 with , and a 454 4-barrel V8 with . Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. The three-speed manual transmission was standard; 4-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3-speed automatic transmissions were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs prevented overheating.

The SS, then a trim option, included a black grill with SS emblem, bodyside striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, special front and rear stabilizer bars, rally wheels, 70-series raised white-lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems. The SS option was available with a 350 or 454 V8 with the 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions. Also it was not widely known, but a Laguna S-3 front end could be fitted on these cars, and was available through the Central Office Production Option (COPO) system as code 6H1. It was not widely ordered by many however, more than likely due to limited information both on the part of customers and many dealers at the time.

The Estate (1973–1976), an option package, was first offered on the El Camino Standard and El Camino Custom, later only the El Camino Custom.

The 1974 El Caminos sported an elongated, Mercedes-type grille. Inside, the new top-of-the-line El Camino Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats (or optional Strato bucket seats) upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. The 350 V8 became the base engine and a 400 V8 engine was new this year. The 454, the top engine, was available with the Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic or 4-speed manual transmission.

The 1975 models featured a new grill, providing a fresh appearance. Suspension upgrades offered a quieter ride, and radial-ply tires became standard. Dual remote mirrors, new twin sport mirrors, intermittent wipers, and cruise control were among new convenience features this year. The 1975 high energy ignition (HEI) provided spark to the spark plugs with minimal maintenance and increased power. The larger distributor cap also provided better high-RPM performance by decreasing the likelihood of the spark conducting to the wrong terminal. The 250-cubic-inch in-line six of was offered as the base engine. The 454-cubic-inch V8, downrated yet again to , made it into 1975 as an El Camino option, but this would be its last go-around. It was not available in California, and the optional four-speed stick was no longer offered. Buyers could now choose an Econominder instrument package that included a vacuum gauge to point out when optimum fuel economy was being attained.

===1976–1977===

For 1976, El Camino Classic models now featured the new rectangular headlights that other high-end GM cars were sporting. These were quad units in stacked arrangement. The base model retained the previously used dual round headlights. Engines included the base 250 I6 engine, a new 305-cubic-inch V8, two- and four-barrel 350s (with availability still depending on California delivery), and the 400-cubic-inch V8, still good for . All engines except the 250 I6 came with the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission as the only transmission available. The 250 I6 came with a 3-speed manual or an optional Turbo Hydra-matic.

The 1977 models were little changed, except the 400 V8 was gone. The El Camino Classic was again the top model and the SS option continued.

==Fifth generation (1978–1987)==
===1978–1981===
A new, trimmer El Camino was unveiled in 1978, adopting the new, more sharp-edged Malibu styling, and a one-inch longer wheelbase of . The front end sheet metal and doors were shared with the Malibu, and the rear bumper was shared with the Malibu station wagon. For the first time, though, the El Camino had a unique chassis – it was shared with no other Chevrolet. The front end featured a new single rectangular headlight design. The base engine was a 200-cubic-inch (3.3-liter) V6 that developed , except in California where, to meet emissions standards, the 231-cubic-inch Buick engine was the base engine. Two upgrades could be ordered: a 305-cubic-inch V8 with , or a 350-cubic-inch V8 with that was only available in El Caminos and Malibu station wagons. It was not available on Malibu passenger cars (with exception to coupe and sedan Malibu 9C1 police vehicles).

The El Camino trims started with the base model, then the Conquista (meaning &#x27;Conquest&#x27; in Spanish) which mainly consisted of a special paint treatment and finally the Super Sport which was the sports model available with six-cylinder and V8 engines. Chevrolet later offered a Black Knight model in 1978 which ended production after only 1,200 examples were produced due to legal problems with the rights holders over the use of the name. This model featured a large hood emblem of two dragons and a knight, and would be reworked and relaunched for 1979 as the Royal Knight option for Super Sport models.

Following its debut as a redesigned &quot;new-size&quot; model in 1978, the 1979 model received minimal changes, which amounted to a little more than a new divided grille. However, a &quot;small-block&quot; 267-cubic-inch (4.4-liter) V8 joined the options list and slotted between the standard 3.3-liter V6 and the optional 5.0-liter four-barrel V8. The 350-cubic-inch (5.7-liter) V8, developing was again available. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions had floor shifters. The Royal Knight option for the Super Sport debuted.
The 1980 El Camino started out the 1980s with few changes, though engine choices were shuffled a little. The base V6 displaced 229 cubic inches, up from 200 the year before. Horsepower increased from . Optional again were a 267-cubic-inch V8 with and a 305 V8, now with (down five). The 350 with offered in 1979 was dropped. A three speed floor shifted manual transmission was standard, but most got the optional three-speed automatic.

The 1981 models received a new horizontal tube grill. The 1981 engines mostly continued from 1980, but now used GM&#x27;s Computer Command Control (CCC) emission system. The base 229-cubic-inch V6 made (down from ), as did the California-only 231-cubic-inch Buick V6. Optional engines were the 267-cubic-inch V8 with and The 305-cubic-inch V8, now with . The three-speed automatic added a lock-up torque converter to aid highway mileage.

===1982–1987===
The 1982 (through the final 1987) El Camino sported a new frontal appearance with a crosshatch grille flanked by quad rectangular headlights. New under the hood for 1982 was a 5.7-liter (350-cubic-inch) Diesel V8, which was also offered in Chevrolet&#x27;s full-size cars. Though mileage with the diesel was commendable, it was an expensive option and would eventually amass a dismal repair record. Gasoline-engine choices were unchanged, except Chevrolet&#x27;s 229-cubic-inch (3.8-liter) V6 was now standard in California-bound cars, replacing Buick&#x27;s 231-cubic-inch V6.

In 1983, the 4.4-liter V8 was gone, leaving the 5.0-liter version as the only optional gas V8. The standard engine was again Chevrolet&#x27;s 3.8-liter V6 with , though California cars, once again, got a Buick V6 with similar specifications. Continuing on the options list was the 5.7-liter V8 Diesel with . The sister Malibu sedan and wagon were discontinued after the 1983 model year. The Royal Knight package was also discontinued in 1983.

The 1983–87 El Camino was also offered as a cosmetic conversion through select dealers (completed by Choo-Choo Customs Inc., of Chattanooga, Tennessee). Modifications included an aerodynamic front end similar to the Monte Carlo SS, side exhaust skirts, and aluminum wheels. The conversion also included the addition of SS decals on the exterior of the body. However, the majority of El Caminos sent for customizing weren&#x27;t actual Super Sports. That distinction was only obtained by ordering the &#x27;SS Sport Decor&#x27; option package from the factory which carries an RPO code of Z15.

For 1985, GM shifted El Camino production to Mexico, and the new fuel-injected 4.3 L V6 became the base engine through 1987. El Camino production ended quietly in late 1987. Some model year 1987s (420 El Caminos and 325 GMC Caballeros) are listed as new car retail deliveries in calendar year 1988 based on their date of first retail sale. Speculation in online forums indicates 3GCCW80H2HS915586 &quot;may&quot; be the final vehicle. The GM Media Archive/Heritage Center confirmed that no 1988 El Caminos or Caballeros were ever produced.
&#x27;

==South Africa==

A range of Chevrolet models, based on the Holden HK, was introduced onto the South African market in 1969. A coupe utility version was released in 1971 under the Chevrolet El Camino name and was offered with imported Holden 186 six and 308 V8 engines. A version of the later Holden HQ utility was marketed in South Africa as the Chevrolet El Camino AQ.
A facelifted El Camino AJ was released in 1976 with production ceasing in 1978.

==Concept vehicles==
In 1974, Chevrolet&#x27;s sister division, Pontiac, reportedly took an El Camino body, grafted on the urethane-nose front end from its Grand Am series, added the GA&#x27;s instrument panel, reclining Strato-bucket seats with adjustable lumbar support along with Pontiac&#x27;s Rally II wheels. This was a styling exercise for a possible Pontiac version of the El Camino; the concept never reached production.

In 1992, GM unveiled an El Camino concept, basically a pickup variant of the Chevrolet Lumina Z34. The concept received mixed, mostly negative reviews, mostly because of its front wheel drive layout.
During the 1995 model year, GM had a concept El Camino based on the full-size
Caprice station wagon using the grille of a 1994–96 Impala SS; this concept was destined for production, but was shelved when GM decided to discontinue the B-platform car line at the end of 1996.

The Pontiac G8 ST was shown at the New York International Auto Show in March 2008. Based on the Holden Commodore Ute, it shared the G8 platform with a cargo bed. The Sport Truck had the same , 6.0-liter V8 used in the G8 GT, as well as the 3.6-liter, direct-injection V6. The G8 ST was slated for release as a 2010 model, but in January 2009, GM announced to dealers the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring, as well as the Pontiac brand being discontinued. In 2011, GM again considered bringing back the El Camino under the Chevrolet brand as early as 2015.

<text>Bangka Lungshan Temple (also Lungshan Temple of Manka, Mengjia Longshan Temple) is a Taiwanese folk temple in Wanhua District (alternately known as Bangka/Mengjia), Taipei, Taiwan. The temple was built in Taipei in 1738 by settlers from Fujian during Qing rule in honor of Guanyin. It served as a place of worship and a gathering place for the Chinese settlers. In addition to its Chinese Buddhist elements, it includes halls and altars to Chinese folk deities such as Mazu and Guan Yu.

==History==
The temple has been destroyed either in full or in part in numerous earthquakes and fires but Taipei residents have consistently rebuilt and renovated it. The temple was rebuilt during Japanese rule. Most recently, it was hit by American bombers during the Taihoku Air Raid on May 31, 1945, during World War II because the Japanese were reportedly hiding armaments there. The main building and the left corridor were damaged and many precious artifacts and artworks were lost. It was rebuilt after the end of World War II a few months later.

==Transportation==
The temple is accessible within walking distance North from Longshan Temple Station of the Taipei Metro.

<doc id="703049" wikidata="Q390710" url="?curid=703049" title="Ponce massacre">
<text>The Ponce massacre was an event that took place on Palm Sunday, March 21, 1937, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, when a peaceful civilian march turned into a police shooting in which 17 civilians and two policemen were killed, and more than 200 civilians wounded. None of the civilians were armed and most of the dead were reportedly shot in their backs. The march had been organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to commemorate the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the U.S. government&#x27;s imprisonment of the Party&#x27;s leader, Pedro Albizu Campos, on sedition charges.

An investigation led by the United States Commission on Civil Rights put the blame for the massacre squarely on the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Blanton Winship. Further criticism by members of the U.S. Congress led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to remove Winship as governor in 1939.

Governor Winship was never prosecuted for the massacre and no one under his chain of command – including the police who took part in the event, and admitted to the mass shooting – was prosecuted or reprimanded.

The Ponce massacre remains the largest massacre in U.S. imperial history in Puerto Rico. It has been the source of many articles, books, paintings, films, and theatrical works.

==Chronology of events==
Several days before the scheduled Palm Sunday march, the Nationalists had received legal permits for a peaceful protest from José Tormos Diego, the mayor of Ponce. According to a 1926 Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruling, government permits were not necessary for the use of plazas, parks or streets for meetings or parades. As a courtesy to the Ponce municipal government, the Nationalists nevertheless requested the permit.

Upon learning about the march, the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, General Blanton Winship, ordered the new Insular Police Chief, Colonel Enrique de Orbeta, to contact Mayor Tormos and have him cancel the parade permit. He ordered the police chief to increase the police force in the southern city, and to stop, &quot;by all means necessary&quot;, any demonstration conducted by the nationalists in Ponce. Without notice to the organizers, or any opportunity to appeal, or any time to arrange an alternate venue, the permits were abruptly withdrawn, just before the protest was scheduled to begin.

Following Governor Winship&#x27;s orders, Colonel de Orbeta went to Ponce where he concentrated police units from across the island sporting &quot;the latest riot control equipment&quot;, among which he included the machine gunners in the island. Winship intended to crush the activities of the Nationalists and their leader, Pedro Albizu Campos. 

The Insular Police, a force somewhat resembling the National Guard, was under the direct military command of Governor Winship and ultimate responsibility for the massacre fell on Winship, who controlled the National Guard and Insular Police, &quot;and ordered the massacre.&quot;

Police Chief Guillermo Soldevilla of the municipality of Juana Díaz, with 14 policemen, took a position in front of the marchers. Chief Perez Segarra and Sgt. Rafael Molina, commanding nine policemen armed with Thompson submachine guns and tear gas bombs, stood in the back. Chief of Police Antonio Bernardi, heading 11 policemen armed with machine guns, stood in the east; and another group of 12 police, armed with rifles, was placed in the west. According to some reports, police numbered &quot;over 200 heavily armed&quot; guards.
 As &quot;La Borinqueña&quot;, Puerto Rico&#x27;s national song, was being played, the Ponce branch of the Cadets of the Republic under the command of Tomás López de Victoria and the rest of the demonstrators began to march.

The Insular Police started firing on the marchers – killing 17 unarmed civilians, two policemen, and wounding over 200 civilians, including women and children. Police firing went on for over 15 minutes. The dead included 17 men, one woman, and a young girl. Some of the dead were demonstrators/cadets, while others were passersby. As of 2009, only two survivors were known to be alive, siblings Fernando and Beatriz Vélez.

The flag-bearer of the Cadets of the Republic was shot and killed during the massacre. A young girl, Carmen Fernández proceeded to take the flag, but was shot and gravely injured. A young Nationalist cadet named Bolívar Márquez dragged himself to the wall of Santo Asilo de Damas and wrote with his blood the following message before dying:

Many were chased by the police and shot or clubbed at the entrance of their houses as they tried to escape. Others were taken from their hiding places and killed. Leopold Tormes, a member of the Puerto Rico legislature, claimed to reporters that a policeman had murdered a nationalist with his bare hands. Dr. José Gandara, a physician who assisted the wounded, testified that wounded people running away were shot, and that many were again wounded by the clubs and bare fists of the police. No arms were found in the hands of the civilians wounded, nor on the dead ones. About 150 of the demonstrators were arrested immediately afterward; they were later released on bail.

==Official version of the events==
The next day, Winship radioed Washington and reported, officially, that the Nationalists had initiated the shooting. Part of his radiogram report stated that &quot;two shots were fired by the Nationalists ... with Nationalists firing from the street, and from roofs and balconies on both sides of the street ... [the police] showed great patience, consideration and understanding of the situation, as did the officers and men under him [the Police Chief].&quot;

The following day, as a result of this misinformation, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that a Nationalist political revolt had claimed the lives of more than eighteen people in Puerto Rico.

The Puerto Rican senator Luis Muñoz Marín traveled to the city of Ponce to investigate the event. After examining the photograph taken by Carlos Torres Morales of &quot;El Imparcial&quot;, which had not yet been published, he wrote a letter to Ruth Hampton, an official at the Department of the Interior. He said that the photograph showed that the policemen were not shooting at the uniformed Nationalists (Cadets), but at a terrified crowd in full flight.

==Investigation and the Hays Commission==

Initial investigations of the event differed on whether the police or the marchers fired the first shots. Governor Winship applied pressure on the district attorney&#x27;s office in charge of the investigation. He requested that the public prosecutor from Ponce, Rafael Pérez Marchand, &quot;arrest more Nationalists&quot;, and that no charges be filed against the police. The prosecutor resigned as a result of being denied the opportunity to conduct a proper investigation.

A Puerto Rican government investigation into the incident drew few conclusions. A second, independent investigation ordered by the United States Commission on Civil Rights led by the ACLU&#x27;s Arthur Garfield Hays, together with Puerto Rican citizens Fulgencio Piñero, Emilio Belaval, José Davila Rice, Antonio Ayuyo Valdivieso, Manuel Díaz García, and Francisco M. Zeno took place. This investigation concluded that the events on 21 March constituted a massacre and mob action by the police. The report harshly criticized the repressive tactics and massive civil rights violations by Governor Winship.

After viewing the photograph taken by Carlos Torres Morales, Hays in his report to the American Civil Liberties Union questioned why the governor&#x27;s investigation had not used the photography, which was among two that were widely published. According to Hays, the photograph clearly showed 18 armed policeman at the corner of Aurora and Marina streets, ready to fire upon a group of innocent bystanders. The image showed the white smoke in the barrel of a policeman&#x27;s revolver as he fired upon the unarmed people. The Hays Commission questioned why the policemen fired directly &quot;at the crowd&quot;, and not at the Nationalist Cadets.
==Casualties==

The following are the names of those killed:
==Aftermath==

===Lack of convictions===
In the aftermath of the massacre, no police officer was convicted or sentenced to jail. No police were demoted or suspended and Governor Winship never issued a public apology.

===Reaction in the U.S. Congress===
The Ponce massacre reverberated through the U.S. Congress. On the House floor, Congressman John T. Bernard expressed his shock and outrage. He said: &quot;The police in Ponce, probably with the encouragement of the North American police chief and even the governor, opened fire on a Palm Sunday Nationalist march, killing seventeen and wounding more than two hundred.&quot;

Congressman Vito Marcantonio joined in the criticism, filing charges against Governor Winship with President Roosevelt. In his speech before Congress titled &quot;Five Years of Tyranny&quot;, Congressman Vito Marcantonio reported that &quot;Ex-Governor Blanton Winship, of Puerto Rico, was summarily removed by the President of the United States on May 12, 1939&quot; after charges were filed against Mr. Winship with the President. In his speech, the Congressman detailed the number of killings by the police and added, &quot;the facts show that the affair of March 21 in Ponce was a massacre ... Governor Winship tried to cover up this massacre by filing a mendacious report&quot; and the congressman called Governor Winship a &quot;tyrant&quot;.

===Attempt on Governor Winship&#x27;s life===
The year following the Ponce massacre, on 25 July 1938, Governor Winship wanted to mark the anniversary of the U.S. 1898 invasion of Puerto Rico with a military parade. He chose the city of Ponce to demonstrate that his &quot;Law and Order&quot; policy had been successful against the Nationalists. During the parade, shots were fired at the grandstand where Winship and his officials were sitting in an attempt to assassinate him. It was the first time that an attempt was made on the life of a Governor of Puerto Rico. Winship escaped unharmed but two men, the assailant and a police officer, were killed, and 36 people were wounded.

The dead were the Nationalist Ángel Esteban Antongiorgi and National Guard Colonel Luis Irizarry. The Nationalist Party denied participation in the attack, but the government arrested several Nationalists and accused nine of &quot;murder and conspiracy to incite violence.&quot; Among the nine Nationalists charged and convicted were Tomás López de Victoria, captain of the Ponce branch of the Cadets of the Republic, and fellow cadets Elifaz Escobar, Santiago González Castro, Juan Pietri and Prudencio Segarra. They served eight years in the Puerto Rico State Penitentiary. The four were pardoned by the next full-term U.S.-appointed governor, Rexford Guy Tugwell.

Winship tried to repress the Nationalists. Jaime Benítez Rexach, a student at the University of Chicago at the time and later long-time chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico, wrote to President Roosevelt stating, &quot;Governor [Winship] himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in an unnecessary state of turmoil. He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that everybody else should keep out.&quot; Winship was replaced in 1939.

==Legacy==
===ACLU Chapter===
One of the by-products of the Ponce Massacre and the Hays Commission was the creation in Puerto Rico of a chapter of the ACLU on May 21, 1937. It was named &quot;Asociación Puertorriqueña de Libertades Civiles&quot; (Puerto Rican Association of Civil Liberties). Its first president was Tomás Blanco, Felipe Colón Díaz and Antonio Fernós Isern were its vice-presidents, the treasurer was Inés María Mendoza, the Secretary was attorney Vicente Géigel Polanco, and the association&#x27;s legal counsel was attorney Ernesto Ramos Antonini. Luis Muñoz Marin and many leaders from Ponce, including attorney Pérez Marchand and some of the members of the Hays Commission were also among the founders.

Today, the Ponce massacre is commemorated annually. 

Ponce Massacre Museum
The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, an agency of the Government of Puerto Rico, operates the Ponce Massacre Museum. It is located at the intersection where the events took place (corner of Marina and Aurora streets). The museum houses photographs and various artifacts from the Ponce massacre. A section of the museum is dedicated to Pedro Albizu Campos.

===In popular culture===
The book &quot;Revolucion en el Infierno&quot; (Revolution in Hell) was published in 2002, and the television film by the same name was released in 2004. It illustrates the events of the Ponce massacre through the life of one of the victims, Ulpiano Perea. The film is an adapted from the playwright by Roberto Ramos Perea, Ulpiano&#x27;s nephew.

Its purpose was to raise conscience among the American people about the event of the Ponce Massacre as most Americans had never heard of the involvement of the U.S. government and the U.S. media in that massacre.

<doc id="703055" wikidata="Q3076557" url="?curid=703055" title="Studley, Warwickshire">
<text>Studley is a large village and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon district of Warwickshire, England. Situated on the western edge of Warwickshire near the border with Worcestershire, it is southeast of Redditch and northwest of Stratford-upon-Avon. The Roman road of Ryknild Street, now the A435, passes through the village on its eastern edge, parallel to the River Arrow. The name derives from the Old English leah, being a meadow or pasture, where horses, stod, are kept.

The United Kingdom Census 2021 reported Studley&#x27;s population as being 6,040.

== History ==

The manor of Studley is recorded twice in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; mostly as part of the lands of William son of Courbucion; who was appointed Sheriff of Warwick soon after 1086; where it reads:

A further holding is listed as part of the land of William Bonavallet:

In the medieval period it was the site of a castle, the old castle was located just north of what is now St Mary&#x27;s Church, and was possibly built around 1135-40, all that remains now is a circular rampart and ditch. This castle is unrelated to the nearby 19th-century house called Studley Castle. There is also the remains of a medieval priory. The Augustinian priory was founded in the 12th century by Peter Corbizun but was closed at the dissolution under Henry VIII and was used as a source of stone for other local buildings. Nothing remains today apart from the use of the name priory in a few local building names such as Priory Farm, which now much modernised, embodies a few fragmentary portions of a conventual building. A gabled west wall of stone rubble contains the remains of a large 14th-century window. A few medieval sculptured fragments are built on to the walls.

The Studley Inclosure Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. &quot;43&quot; ) inclosed land in the parish.

== Economy ==

Studley is also known for being the site of a sewing needle and surgical needle making industry. This specialisation started when Elizabeth I permitted a number of Huguenot refugees to settle here, bringing this rare craft with them.

From the 19th century, precision-made surgical needles were in demand, and, with advances in manufacturing technology, such was the demand that over 3,000 workers were employed. In 1977 the old factory where needles were made was burnt down, and the production of &quot;Aero&quot; needles moved to a nearby site. The original factory site now contains a supermarket, other retail outlets, and housing. One of the streets in the village is named &quot;Crooks Lane&quot;, ostensibly because the crooked needles from the original factory were dumped at the end of this lane, but the road was there before the village had a needle factory.

==Governance==

Studley is a ward of Stratford on Avon District Council and represented by Councillors Justin kerridge, Conservative and Hazel Wright, Liberal Democrat. Nationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon (UK Parliament constituency), whose current Member of Parliament is Manuela Perteghella of the Liberal Democrats. Before Brexit in 2020, it was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament.

==Geography==

Studley is surrounded on the north, east and west by hills rising to about 500 ft. The River Arrow flows across the south-west corner, through flat ground, but the country north and east of the brook is for the most part undulating and well wooded. The main village lies on the west bank of the river, along the Roman Rykneild Way, which is now the A435, Alcester-Birmingham main road. The fact that the church and the site of the castle are about half a mile away on the opposite side of the river indicates that the original settlement was, at some distance from the Roman road. At Washford, half a mile north of Studley village, the main road bears right from the Rykneild Street and continues through the hamlet of Mappleborough Green and up Gorcott Hill, which marks the northern extremity of the parish. The Rykneild Street (which between Washford and Ipsley diverges considerably from its original line) was, until the end of the 18th century, the main road to Birmingham; the present road between Spernall Ash (on the southern boundary of Studley parish) and Digbeth in Birmingham was turnpiked by an act of Parliament of 1721.

==Notable buildings==
The parish church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin consists of a chancel, nave, south aisle and west tower. It features a 12th-century north wall and window of Norman date, fine surviving examples of opus spicatum or herringbone masonry, a medieval rood screen, Elizabethan era table and dug out chest, Jacobean era pulpit and brasses and other points of interest.

The survey of the clergy by the puritans in 1586 described the then vicar, Thomas Penford as; &quot;dumbe &amp; vnlearned, a verie aged man, he can scarce reade, yet he hath learning enough for 2 benefices ; for he reapeth the fruite of Studley &amp; Coughton both, he hath of late gotten him a certaine hireling to serue his turne at both places, one Robt. Cathell a seelie Welshman that can scarce reade English distinctlie. The valew of both is better then xx&quot; by the yeare&quot;.

There is also St Mary&#x27;s Church, a Roman Catholic church dating from 1853, designed by Charles Hansom, this is grade II listed.

== Education ==

Studley has 3 primary and one secondary school within the Warwickshire Local Education Authority (LEA) area.

== Sports and leisure ==

Studley is often noted as having many pubs, 17 within one square mile. 

As well as having a number of football teams, including Studley BKL and Studley Juniors, founded a few years ago by Kevin Sanders and Mike Imms, (formed when the Redditch United Youth Teams broke away and were taken on by Studley BKL), the village also gives its name to Studley Musical Theatre and Operatic group which has been going for over 100 years. They perform twice a year, once in April in a spring show, performing Oliver in 2010 and Fiddler on the Roof in April 2011 and a summer concert.

Just outside the village on the Birmingham road is Studley Cricket Club, home to a social and sports club, members of the Birmingham and District Premier League, (top of the regional midlands structure).

There is also a large mixed sports and social club in Eldorado Close (Studley Sports &amp; Social Club, commonly known as the Entaco). This is home to a number of football teams across its 2 pitches, as well as being one of the bases of Redditch Entaco Cricket Club. The club also has a number of tennis courts and a bowling green.
==Transport==
The A435 road passes through the village. Between 1868 and 1962, the village was served by Studley &amp; Astwood Bank railway station on the former Evesham Loop Line. The nearest railway station today is .

==Notable people==

*Hannah Hampton, professional association footballer, grew up in the village.
*Andy Smith, a former Professional Darts Corporation lives in the village.
*Freddie Starr, singer, had a home in Studley.

<text>A conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system (AFCS) consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft&#x27;s direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered flight controls as they change speed.

The fundamentals of aircraft controls are explained in flight dynamics. This article centers on the operating mechanisms of the flight controls. The basic system in use on aircraft first appeared in a readily recognizable form as early as April 1908, on Louis Blériot&#x27;s Blériot VIII pioneer-era monoplane design.

==Cockpit controls==

=== Primary controls ===

Generally, the primary cockpit flight controls are arranged as follows:
* A control yoke (also known as a control column), centre stick or side-stick (the latter two also colloquially known as a control or joystick), governs the aircraft&#x27;s roll and pitch by moving the ailerons (or activating wing warping on some very early aircraft designs) when turned or deflected left and right, and moves the elevators when moved backwards or forwards.
* Rudder pedals, or the earlier, pre-1919 &quot;rudder bar&quot;, control yaw by moving the rudder; the left foot forward will move the rudder left for instance.
* Thrust lever or throttle, which controls engine speed or thrust for powered aircraft.

The control yokes also vary greatly among aircraft. There are yokes where roll is controlled by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch is controlled by moving the control column towards or away from the pilot, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke into and out of the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.
Even when an aircraft uses variant flight control surfaces such as a V-tail ruddervator, flaperons, or elevons, because these various combined-purpose control surfaces control rotation about the same three axes in space, the aircraft&#x27;s flight control system will still be designed so that the stick or yoke controls pitch and roll conventionally, as will the rudder pedals for yaw. The basic pattern for modern flight controls was pioneered by French aviation figure Robert Esnault-Pelterie, with fellow French aviator Louis Blériot popularizing Esnault-Pelterie&#x27;s control format initially on Louis&#x27; Blériot VIII monoplane in April 1908, and standardizing the format on the July 1909 Channel-crossing Blériot XI. Flight control has long been taught in such fashion for many decades, as popularized in ab initio instructional books such as the 1944 work Stick and Rudder.

In some aircraft, the control surfaces are not manipulated with a linkage. In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders, for example, there is no mechanism at all. Instead, the pilot just grabs the lifting surface by hand (using a rigid frame that hangs from its underside) and moves it.

===Secondary controls===

In addition to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload. The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control elevator trim, so that the pilot does not have to maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch attitude (other types of trim, for rudder and ailerons, are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones). Many aircraft have wing flaps, controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing. Other secondary flight control systems may include slats, spoilers, air brakes and variable-sweep wings.

==Flight control systems==

===Mechanical===
Mechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder in addition to the warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.
Increases in the control surface area, and the higher airspeeds required by faster aircraft resulted in higher aerodynamic loads on the flight control systems. As a result, the forces required to move them also become significantly larger. Consequently, complicated mechanical gearing arrangements were developed to extract maximum mechanical advantage in order to reduce the forces required from the pilots. This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50.

Some mechanical flight control systems use servo tabs that provide aerodynamic assistance. Servo tabs are small surfaces hinged to the control surfaces. The flight control mechanisms move these tabs, aerodynamic forces in turn move, or assist the movement of the control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed. This arrangement was used in early piston-engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports. The Boeing 737 incorporates a system, whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure, it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo-tab.

===Hydro-mechanical===

The complexity and weight of mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. Hydraulically powered control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft&#x27;s size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot&#x27;s muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback).

A hydro-mechanical flight control system has two parts:
*The &quot;mechanical circuit&quot;, which links the cockpit controls with the hydraulic circuits. Like the mechanical flight control system, it consists of rods, cables, pulleys, and sometimes chains.
*The &quot;hydraulic circuit&quot;, which has hydraulic pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and actuators. The actuators are powered by the hydraulic pressure generated by the pumps in the hydraulic circuit. The actuators convert hydraulic pressure into control surface movements. The electro-hydraulic servo valves control the movement of the actuators.

The pilot&#x27;s movement of a control causes the mechanical circuit to open the matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the servo valve is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage - one that stops movement of the control surface at the desired position.

This arrangement was found in the older-designed jet transports and in some high-performance aircraft. Examples include the Antonov An-225 and the Lockheed SR-71.

====Artificial feel devices====
With purely mechanical flight control systems, the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt and there is a risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF&#x27;s Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF&#x27;s Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a &#x27;bob-weight&#x27; was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane&#x27;s normal acceleration.

====Stick shaker====

A stick shaker is a device that is attached to the control column in some hydraulic aircraft. It shakes the control column when the aircraft is approaching stall conditions. Some aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 are equipped with a back-up electrical power supply that can be activated to enable the stick shaker in case of hydraulic failure.

====Power-by-wire====
In most current systems the power is provided to the control actuators by high-pressure hydraulic systems. In fly-by-wire systems the valves, which control these systems, are activated by electrical signals. In power-by-wire systems, electrical actuators are used in favour of hydraulic pistons. The power is carried to the actuators by electrical cables. These are lighter than hydraulic pipes, easier to install and maintain, and more reliable. Elements of the F-35 flight control system are power-by-wire. The actuators in such an electro-hydrostatic actuation (EHA) system are self-contained hydraulic devices, small closed-circuit hydraulic systems. The overall aim is towards more- or all-electric aircraft and an early example of the approach was the Avro Vulcan. Serious consideration was given to using the approach on the Airbus A380.

===Fly-by-wire control systems===

A fly-by-wire (FBW) system replaces manual flight control of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the term &quot;fly-by-wire&quot;), and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot&#x27;s knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems are part of the field known as avionics.

Fly-by-optics, also known as &quot;fly-by-light&quot;, is a further development using fiber-optic cables.

==Research==
Several technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as ailerons, elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, inertia (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and radar cross section for stealth. These may be used in many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and 6th generation fighter aircraft. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.

===Flexible wings===
In flexible wings, also known as &quot;morphing aerofoils&quot;, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an ornithopter. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing was a US Air Force, NASA, and Boeing effort. Notable efforts have also been made by FlexSys, who have conducted flight tests using flexible aerofoils retrofitted to a Gulf stream III aircraft.

===Active Flow Control===
In active flow control systems, forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger and more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller, simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles. In this use, active flow control promises simplicity and lower mass, costs (up to half less), and inertia and response times. This was demonstrated in the Demon UAV, which flew for the first time in the UK in September 2010.
