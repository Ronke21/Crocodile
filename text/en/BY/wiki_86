<text>Narratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect human perception. The term is an anglicisation of French &quot;narratologie&quot;, coined by Tzvetan Todorov (&quot;Grammaire du Décaméron&quot;, 1969). Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (&quot;Poetics&quot;) but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (&quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot;, 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin&#x27;s theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in &quot;The Dialogic Imagination&quot; (1975). 

Cognitive narratology is a more recent development that allows for a broader understanding of narrative. Rather than focus on the structure of the story, cognitive narratology asks &quot;how humans make sense of stories&quot; and &quot;how humans use stories as sense-making instruments&quot;.

== Defining narrative ==

Structuralist narratologists like Rimmon-Kenan define narrative fiction as &quot;the narration of a succession of fictional events&quot;. 

Cognitive narratologists focus on how people experience something as narrative rather than on the structure of the text itself. The six-word story &quot;For sale: baby shoes, never worn&quot;, is often given as an example that would not qualify as a narrative in the strictly structural approach, but that evokes a sense of narrative. 

Marie-Laure Ryan distinguishes between &quot;a narrative&quot; as an object that can be clearly defined and the quality of narrativity, which means &quot;being able to inspire a narrative response”. This allows her to understand video games as possessing narrativity without necessarily being conventional narratives. Astrid Ensslin builds upon this, explaining that &quot;games have the potential to evoke multiple, individualized narrative scripts through world-building, causal event design, character development and other elements that players interact with the intention to solve problems and make progress&quot;.

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; Percy Lubbock&#x27;s work in point of view (&quot;The Craft of Fiction&quot;, 1921) offers a case in point.

In 1966 a special issue of the journal &quot;Communications&quot; proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a manifesto. It included articles by Roland Barthes, Claude Brémond, Gérard Genette, Algirdas Julien Greimas, Tzvetan Todorov and others, which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir Propp (1895–1970).

Jonathan Culler (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between &quot;story,&quot; a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and &quot;discourse,&quot; the discursive presentation or narration of events.&#x27;
The Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet fabula and syuzhet. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. &quot;histoire&quot;/&quot;discours&quot;, &quot;histoire&quot;/&quot;récit&quot;, &quot;story&quot;/&quot;plot&quot;. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and syuzhet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology. The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, the transformation of the chronological order, rhythm, and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993, Ricoeur, 1984, and Baroni, 2007) have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still, the term &quot;narratology&quot; is most typically applied to literary theory and literary criticism, as well as film theory and (to a lesser extent) film criticism. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include sociolinguistic studies of oral storytelling (William Labov) and in conversation analysis or discourse analysis that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, graphic novels, the infinite canvas, and narrative sculptures linked to topology and graph theory.
However, constituent analysis of a type where narremes are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of linguistics, semiotics, or literary theory.
== In new media ==
Digital-media theorist and professor Janet Murray theorized a shift in storytelling and narrative structure in the twentieth century as a result of scientific advancement in her 1998 book &quot;Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace&quot;. Murray argues that narrative structures such as the multi-narrative more accurately reflected &quot;post-Einstein physics&quot; and the new perceptions of time, process, and change, than the traditional linear narrative. The unique properties of computers are better-suited for expressing these &quot;limitless, intersecting&quot; stories or &quot;cyberdramas&quot;. These cyberdramas differ from traditional forms of storytelling in that they invite the reader into the narrative experience through interactivity i.e. hypertext fiction and Web soap &quot;The Spot.&quot; Murray also controversially declared that video games – particularly role-playing games and life-simulators like &quot;The Sims&quot;, contain narrative structures or invite the users to create them. She supported this idea in her article &quot;Game Story to Cyberdrama&quot; in which she argued that stories and games share two important structures: contest and puzzles. 

=== Electronic literature and cybertext ===
Development and exclusive consumption of digital devices and interactivity are key characteristics of electronic literature. This has resulted in varying narrative structures of these interactive media. Nonlinear narratives serve as the base of many interactive fictions. Sometimes used interchangeably with hypertext fiction, the reader or player plays a significant role in the creation of a unique narrative developed by the choices they make within the story-world. Stuart Moulthrop&#x27;s &quot;Victory Garden&quot; is one of the first and most studied examples of hypertext fiction, featuring 1,000 lexias and 2,800 hyperlinks.

In his book &quot;Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature&quot;, Espen Aarseth conceived the concept of cybertext, a subcategory of ergodic literature, to explain how the medium and mechanical organization of the text affects the reader&#x27;s experience:

...when you read from a cybertext, you are constantly reminded of inaccessible strategies and paths not taken, voices not heard. Each decision will make some parts of the text more, and others less, accessible, and you may never know the exact results of your choices; that is, exactly what you missed.
The narrative structure or game-worlds of these cybertexts are compared to a labyrinth that invites the player, a term Aarseth deems more appropriate than the reader, to play, explore and discover paths within these texts. Two kinds of labyrinths that are referenced by Aarseth are the unicursal labyrinth which holds one single, winding path that leads to a hidden center, and the multicursal labyrinth, synonymous with a maze, which is branching and complex with the path and direction chosen by the player. These concepts help to distinguish between ergodic (unicursal) and nonergodic literature (multicursal). Some works such as Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Pale Fire&quot; have proven to potentially be both depending on the path the reader takes.

==Theorists==
Art critic and philosopher, Arthur Danto, refers to the narrative as describing two separate events.
Narrative is also linked to language. The way a story can be manipulated by a character, or in the display of medium contributes to how a story is seen by the world. 
Narratology, as defined by Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, is a branch of narrative theory. The concept of narratology was developed mainly in France during the sixties and seventies. 
Theorists have argued for a long time about the form and context of narratology. American psychologist Robert Sternburg argued that narratology is &quot;structuralism at variance with the idea of structure”. This basis goes with the French-American belief that narratology is a logical perversion, meaning that it followed a course that at the time did not seem logical.
Another theorist Peter Brooks sees narrative as being designed and having intent which is what shapes the structure of a story.
Narrative theorist Roland Barthes argues that all narratives have similar structures and in every sentence, there are multiple meanings.
Barthes sees literature as &quot;writerly text&quot; which does not need a typical plot that has a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, written work &quot;has multiple entrances and exits.&quot;
Theorist Greimas agrees with other theorists by acknowledging that there is a structure in narrative and set out to find the deep structure of narrativity. However, in his findings, Greimas says that narratology can be used to describe phenomena outside of the written word and linguistics as a whole. He establishes a connection between the physical form of something and the language used to describe that something which breaks the structural code that many other theorists base their research on.

<text>Paul Bogle (1822 – 24 October 1865) was a Jamaican Baptist deacon and activist. He is a National Hero of Jamaica. He was a leader of the 1865 Morant Bay protesters, who marched for justice and fair treatment for all the people in Jamaica. After leading the Morant Bay rebellion, Bogle was captured, tried and convicted by the colonial government (who had declared martial law), and hanged on 24 October 1865 in the Morant Bay court house.

Bogle had become a friend of a wealthy landowner and fellow Baptist George William Gordon, a bi-racial man who served in the Assembly as one of two representatives from St. Thomas-in-the-East parish. Gordon was instrumental in Bogle being appointed deacon of Stony Gut Baptist Church in 1864. Conditions were hard for black peasants, due to social discrimination, flooding and crop failure, and epidemics. The required payment of poll taxes prevented most of them from voting. In August 1865, Gordon criticised the governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre, for sanctioning &quot;everything done by the higher class to the oppression of the negroes&quot;.

Bogle concentrated on improving the conditions of the poor. As awareness of social injustices and people&#x27;s grievances grew, Bogle led a group of small farmers 45 miles to the capital, Spanish Town, hoping to meet with Governor Eyre to discuss their issues, but they were denied an audience. The people of Stony Gut lost confidence and trust in the Government, and Bogle&#x27;s supporters grew in number in the parish.

On 7 October 1865, Bogle and some supporters attended a trial of two men from Stony Gut. One was convicted and sentenced to prison on charges of trespassing on a long abandoned plantation. A member of Bogle&#x27;s group protested in court over the case, but was immediately arrested, angering the crowd further. He was rescued moments later when Bogle and his men took to the market square and retaliated. The police were severely beaten and forced to retreat.

On Monday, 9 October 1865, warrants were issued against Bogle and a number of others for riot and assault. The police arrived in Stony Gut to arrest Bogle but met with stiff resistance from the residents. They fought the police, forcing them to retreat to Morant Bay.

A few days later on 11 October 1865, there was a vestry meeting in the Court House. That day Bogle led hundreds of followers, armed with sticks and machetes, on a protest march to the court house. The authorities had mustered a volunteer militia, who fired into the protesters after stones were thrown, killing seven men. The protesters set fire to the Court House and nearby buildings. When officials tried to leave, several were killed by the angry mob outside; a total of 25 on both sides died that day.

Black peasants rose and took control of the parish for two days. The governor quickly retaliated, declaring martial law and ordering troops to capture the rebels and suppress the rebellion. The troops destroyed Stony Gut and Bogle&#x27;s chapel, killing more than 400 persons outright across the parish, including women and children. They arrested more than 300 persons, including Bogle. Jamaican Maroons from Moore Town eventually captured Bogle and delivered him to the colonial government. He was tried under martial law and quickly executed, as were many others. Others, including women, and children were brought back to Morant Bay to be tried under martial law. Gordon was convicted of conspiracy and hanged on 23 October, and Bogle was hanged the following day.

Back in Britain there was public outcry, and increased opposition from liberals against Eyre&#x27;s handling of the situation, with accusations against him of murder. Supporters praised the governor for acting quickly in the crisis to suppress a potentially larger rebellion.

==Aftermath==
By the end of 1865 the &quot;Governor Eyre Case&quot; had become the subject of widespread national debate. In January 1866, a Royal Commission was sent to investigate the events. Governor Eyre was suspended and recalled to England and eventually dismissed. The national government changed that of Jamaica. The House of Assembly resigned its charter, and Jamaica was made a Crown Colony, governed directly by Britain.

The &quot;Eyre Controversy&quot; turned into a long and increasingly public issue, dividing well-known figures of the day. It may have contributed to the fall of the government. In 1866 John Stuart Mill set up and chaired the Jamaica Committee to examine the atrocities committed in Jamaica in the course of ending the rebellion. Thomas Carlyle set up a rival committee to defend Eyre. His supporters included John Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, Charles Dickens and Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

The Morant Bay rebellion turned out to be one of the defining points in Jamaica&#x27;s struggle for both political and economical enhancement. Bogle&#x27;s demonstration ultimately achieved its objectives and paved the way for new attitudes.

== Legacy ==
In 1969 Paul Bogle was named a National Hero along with George William Gordon, Marcus Garvey, Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Washington Manley. In the 1970s, two other National Heroes were added in the form of Samuel Sharpe and Queen Nanny of the Maroons.

Bogle is depicted on the heads side of the Jamaican 10-cent coin. His face was also depicted on the Jamaican two-dollar bill, from 1969 until 1989, when the two-dollar bill was phased out. Since 2023, he has been featured on the fifty dollar bill alongside George William Gordon. The identity of the sitter in the photograph used for these depictions is disputed.

The Paul Bogle High School in the parish of his birth is named after him.

He is referred to together with Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution, in the name of the London-based publishing company Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture.

=== In popular culture ===
As a national hero, Paul Bogle is referenced in many works of Jamaican culture. Most notably, dancehall performer Gerald Levy&#x27;s stage name was &quot;Bogle&quot; (also &quot;Mr Bogle&quot; and &quot;Father Bogle&quot;).

Third World produced a song about Bogle&#x27;s execution, &quot;1865 (96 Degrees In The Shade)&quot;, released in 1977 on the album of the same name. Other reggae artists who have named and written songs in tribute to Paul Bogle include Lee Scratch Perry and a co-production between The Aggrovators and the Revolutionaries.

Bogle is mentioned in songs by Burning Spear, Brigadier Jerry, The Cimarons, Steel Pulse, Prince Far I, Lauryn Hill, Third World and General Trees.

In &quot;So Much Things to Say&quot;, by Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers (and subsequently covered by Lauryn Hill), Marley mentions Bogle in the same breath as Jesus Christ and Marcus Garvey, concluding: &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget no way they turned their backs on Paul Bogle, so don&#x27;t you forget no youth who you are and where you stand in the struggle.&quot;

Paul Bogle is mentioned in the songs &quot;See them a come&quot; and &quot;Innocent blood&quot; by the reggae band Culture. Tarrus Riley also mentions Paul Bogle in the song &quot;Shaka Zulu Pickney&quot;, alluding to his ancestry as a freedom fighter. St Thomas-born reggae artist Dwight &quot;Bushman&quot; Duncan hosts an annual Black History Month event called Football N Style in honor of Paul Bogle. He has also dedicated a series of his YouTube blog &quot;Where I&#x27;m From&quot; to Paul Bogle and the Morant Bay uprising.

Paul Bogle and the events outlined above are the theme of &quot;Ballard of 65&quot; by General Trees.

The British rapper Akala references Bogle on the track &quot;Maangamizi&quot; from his album &quot;The Thieves Banquet&quot;, saying: &quot;Probably don&#x27;t know the Haitian Revolution caused the French to sell half of America, nor know the role that Africans played in the Civil War for that same America. If you ain&#x27;t heard of Nanny of the Maroons or Bogle, you probably believe what they told you.&quot;

Jamaican reggae and dancehall musician Junior Reid mentions Paul Bogle in the song &quot;Same Boat&quot;, which recalls the era of slavery, by saying &quot;Paul Bogle haffi run like Usain Bolt&quot;.

Both George William Gordon and Paul Bogle are mentioned in Horace Andy&#x27;s &quot;Our Jamaican National Heroes&quot;, while Ruddy Thomas&#x27; &quot;Grandfather Bogle&quot; is a Bogle tribute.

Bogle and the Morant Bay rebellion are pivotal plot points in Zadie Smith&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;The Fraud&quot;.

<text>Arsinoë IV (; between 68 and 63 BC – 41 BC) was the youngest daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes. One of the last members of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she claimed title of Queen of Ptolemaic Egypt and co-rulership with her brother Ptolemy XIII in 48 BC – 47 BC in opposition to her sister or half-sister, Cleopatra VII. For her role in conducting the siege of Alexandria (47 BC) against Cleopatra, Arsinoë was taken as a prisoner of war to Rome by the Roman triumvir Julius Caesar following the defeat of Ptolemy XIII in the Battle of the Nile. Arsinoë was then exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus in Roman Anatolia, but she was executed there by orders of triumvir Mark Antony in 41 BC at the behest of his lover Cleopatra VII.

== History ==
Arsinoë was the third, possibly fourth daughter of Ptolemy XII by an unknown woman (Cleopatra VII&#x27;s probable mother Cleopatra V had died or been repudiated not long after Cleopatra VII was born, hence it&#x27;s unclear if she bore her husband&#x27;s younger children.) When Ptolemy XII died in 51 BC, he left his eldest son and eldest surviving daughter, Ptolemy and Cleopatra, as joint rulers of Egypt, but Ptolemy soon dethroned Cleopatra and forced her to flee from Alexandria. Julius Caesar arrived in Alexandria in 48 BC pursuing his rival, Pompey, whom he had defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus. When he arrived in Alexandria, he was presented with Pompey&#x27;s head. The execution of his long-term rival ended the possibility of an alliance between Caesar and Ptolemy, and he sided with Cleopatra&#x27;s faction. He declared that in accordance with Ptolemy XII&#x27;s will, Cleopatra and Ptolemy would rule Egypt jointly, and in a similar motion restored Cyprus, which had been annexed by Rome in 58 BC, to Egypt&#x27;s rule and gave it to Arsinoë and her youngest brother, Ptolemy XIV.

However, Arsinoë then escaped from the capital with her mentor, the eunuch Ganymedes, and took command of the Egyptian army. She also proclaimed herself Queen as Arsinoë IV, executed Achillas, whom she had replaced as the army commander, and placed Ganymedes second in command of the army immediately below herself. Under Arsinoë&#x27;s leadership, the Egyptians enjoyed some success against the Romans. The Egyptians trapped Caesar in a section of the city by building walls to close off the streets. Caesar countered this measure by digging wells into the porous limestone beneath the city that contained fresh water. This only partially alleviated the situation, so he then sent ships out along the coast to search for more fresh water there. Caesar realized that he would need to break out of the city and hoped to do so by gaining control of the harbor. He launched an attack to seize control of the Lighthouse of Alexandria but Arsinoë&#x27;s forces drove him back. Recognizing his imminent defeat, Caesar removed his armor and purple cloak so that he could swim to the safety of a nearby Roman ship.

The leading Egyptian officers, having become disappointed with Ganymedes, and under a pretext of wanting peace, negotiated with Caesar to exchange Arsinoë for Ptolemy XIII. After Ptolemy was released he continued the war until the Romans received reinforcements and inflicted a decisive defeat upon the Egyptians. Arsinoë, now in Roman captivity, was transported to Rome, where in 46 BC she was forced to appear in Caesar&#x27;s triumph and was paraded behind a burning effigy of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which had been the scene of her victory over him. Arsinoe, along with Juba II, elicited sympathy from the crowd. Despite the custom of strangling prominent prisoners in triumphs when the festivities concluded, Caesar was pressured to spare Arsinoë and granted her sanctuary at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Arsinoë lived in the temple for a few years, always keeping a watchful eye on her sister Cleopatra, who perceived Arsinoë as a threat to her power. In 41 BC, at Cleopatra&#x27;s instigation, Mark Antony ordered Arsinoë&#x27;s execution on the steps of the temple. Her murder was a gross violation of the temple sanctuary and an act that scandalised Rome. The eunuch priest (&quot;Megabyzos&quot;) who had welcomed Arsinoë on her arrival at the temple as &quot;queen&quot; was only pardoned when an embassy from Ephesus made a petition to Cleopatra.

== Year of birth ==
Arsinoë&#x27;s year of birth is generally regarded as being between 68 and 63 BC: The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; cites 63 BC, making her 15 at the time of her uprising and defeat against Julius Caesar and 22 at her death, while the researcher Alissa Lyon cites 68 BC making her 27 at her death. Joyce Tyldesley places her birth date as between 68 and 65 BC. An alternate hypothesis was in the docudrama &quot;Cleopatra: Portrait of a Killer&quot;, in which it was alleged a headless skeleton of a female child between the ages of 15 and 18 may be Arsinoë.

Her actions in the brief war against Caesar naturally suggest that she was older than that and thus, would make it impossible for her to be the headless female child buried in the tomb. Perhaps the strongest evidence that she was in fact exercising her own authority is that Caesar, after the Pharos debacle, was prepared to release Ptolemy XIII — a male, who continued the war against Caesar — just to get his hands on her. Stacy Schiff, who places Arsinoë&#x27;s age at around seventeen during the events of 48-47 BC, notes that Arsinoë &quot;burned with ambition&quot; and was &quot;not the kind of girl who inspired complacency,&quot; writing that once Arsinoë escaped the royal palace she became more vocal against her half-sister and that she assumed her position as head of the army alongside anti-Caesar courtier Achillas.

== Tomb at Ephesus ==
In the 1990s an octagonal monument situated in the centre of Ephesus was hypothesized by Hilke Thür of the Austrian Academy of Sciences to be the tomb of Arsinoë. Although no inscription remains on the tomb, it was dated to between 50 and 20 BC. In 1926 the skeleton of a purported female estimated to be between the ages of 15 and 18 years at the time of her death was found in the burial chamber. Thür&#x27;s identification of the skeleton was based on the shape of the tomb, which was octagonal, like the second tier of the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the carbon dating of the bones (between 200 and 20 BC), the gender of the skeleton, and the age of the child at death. It was also claimed that the tomb boasts Egyptian motifs, such as &quot;papyri-bundle&quot; columns.

A DNA test was also attempted to determine the identity of the child. However, it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times, and the skull was long thought to have been lost. Hilke Thür examined the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull, which was reconstructed using computer technology by forensic anthropologist Caroline Wilkinson to show what the woman may have looked like. Thür alleged that it shows signs of African ancestry mixed with classical Grecian features – despite the fact that Boas, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard, and others have demonstrated that skull measurements are not a reliable indicator of race, and the measurements were jotted down in 1920 before modern forensic science took hold. Arsinoë and Cleopatra, shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but may have had different mothers, with Thür claiming the alleged African ancestry came from the skeleton&#x27;s mother. Furthermore, craniometry as used by Thür to determine race is based in scientific racism that is now generally considered a discredited 
pseudoscience with &quot;a long history of being put to use in racially motivated and often overtly and explicitly racist ways.&quot;

Mary Beard wrote a dissenting essay criticizing the findings, pointing out that, first, there is no surviving name on the tomb and that the claim the tomb is alleged to invoke the shape of the Pharos Lighthouse &quot;doesn&#x27;t add up&quot;; second, the skull doesn&#x27;t survive intact and the age of the skeleton is too young to be Arsinoë&#x27;s (the bones said to be that of a 15-18 year old, with Arsinoë being around her mid twenties at her death); and third, since Cleopatra and Arsinoë were not known to have the same mother, &quot;the ethnic argument goes largely out of the window.&quot;

In 2022 archeologists of the University of Graz were able to locate the skull in Vienna. It could be identified thanks to the old notes and photographs. The scientists hoped that some DNA was conserved in the petrous temporal bone of the skull.

A writer from &quot;The Times&quot; described the identification of the skeleton as &quot;a triumph of conjecture over certainty&quot;.

In 2025, a study was published that identified the skeleton as belonging to a boy, rendering Arsinoë&#x27;s remains missing.

<text>The S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, commonly known as the Newhouse School, is the communications and journalism school of Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. The school was named after publishing magnate Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., founder of Advance Publications, who provided the founding gift in 1964.

The school enrolls approximately 2,000 undergraduate students, 180 residential master’s degree students, 200 online master&#x27;s degree students, and 15 doctoral degree candidates as of 2022. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective. The school has about 80 full-time faculty members and about 50 adjunct instructors. Mark J. Lodato has been the dean of the Newhouse School since July 2020. 

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The Department of Journalism was established at Syracuse University in 1919 as a part of the College of Business Administration. The Theta Sigma Phi () journalism sorority was established in 1920. SU produced a radio show over WSYR-FM in 1932 and the production studio was housed in the Crouse College.

===Formation of the School of Journalism===

The department became a separate School of Journalism in 1934, with Matthew Lyle Spencer serving as the founding dean. The new school was housed in the Yates Castle (Renwick Castle) from 1934 until the buildings demolition in 1954. The school was moved into the Old Gym from 1953 until that building was razed in 1965.

In 1932, Syracuse University became the first university in the nation to offer a college credit radio course. In 1947, SU launched WAER, one of the nation&#x27;s first college radio stations. With the emergence of television, SU was the first to offer instruction in the field in 1956.

===Construction of the Newhouse Complex===


In 1964, supported by a $15 million gift from Samuel Irving &quot;S. I.&quot; Newhouse Jr., the Newhouse Communications Complex was officially inaugurated in Newhouse 1, an award-winning building designed by architect I. M. Pei, which housed the School of Journalism. The building was dedicated by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who delivered his famous &quot;Gulf of Tonkin Speech&quot; on the Newhouse Plaza.

In 1971, the School of Journalism merged with the Department of Television-Radio and was renamed the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. A second building, Newhouse 2, was dedicated in 1974 with a keynote address by William S. Paley, chairman of the board of CBS. It cost $7.2 million to build.

In 2003, the Newhouse School received a $15 million gift from the S. I. Newhouse Foundation and the Newhouse family to fund the construction of the third building in the Newhouse Communications Complex. The $31.6 million modern structure, designed by the former Polshek Partnership, features the First Amendment etched in six-foot-high letters on its curving glass windows. Newhouse 3 was dedicated on September 19, 2007, with a keynote address from the Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts.

In September 2014, the school completed an $18 million renovation of the Newhouse 2 building, creating the Newhouse Studio and Innovation Center, which features Dick Clark Studios, the Alan Gerry Center for Media Innovation and the Diane and Bob Miron Digital News Center. Oprah Winfrey attended and spoke at the dedication ceremony.

In January 2020, Donald E. Newhouse donated $75 million to the School through the Newhouse Foundation.

<doc id="718781" wikidata="Q2634067" url="?curid=718781" title="Jerry Harrison">
<text>Jeremiah Griffin Harrison (born February 21, 1949) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, and entrepreneur. He began his professional music career as a member of the band the Modern Lovers, before becoming keyboardist and guitarist for the new wave group Talking Heads. In 2002, Harrison was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Talking Heads.

Following David Byrne&#x27;s announcement of Talking Heads&#x27; disbanding in 1991, Harrison has focused more on producing other bands, a role he started while still with Talking Heads, first producing the album &quot;Milwaukee&quot; with Elliott Murphy, and then later working with Violent Femmes on their third album, &quot;The Blind Leading the Naked&quot;, in 1986.

During the 1990s, he produced a number of hit albums for bands such as Live, The Verve Pipe, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd among others. He has also released three albums of solo music (all while Talking Heads were still active) and has participated in a number of partial reunions of Talking Heads. In 1999, he helped found the online music community GarageBand.com.

==Early life==
Harrison was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was exposed to artistic fields from a young age: his mother studied art and taught at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Layton School of Art; his father was a musician and worked as an executive in an advertisement firm. Harrison graduated from Shorewood High School (Wisconsin). where he played in many bands, was in the debate club, the student council, the youth club, the math club, also played basketball and was a part of the track team. He later attended Harvard College where he graduated Magna Cum Laude in Visual and Environmental Studies in 1972 with his bachelor thesis being about the fields of painting, sculpture and drawing.

==Career==
===The Modern Lovers===
In 1971, Harrison met Jonathan Richman, and they formed the Modern Lovers. Harrison was introduced to Richman by mutual friend and journalist Danny Fields and the pair bonded over their shared love of the Velvet Underground. He joined The Modern Lovers in early 1971, playing on their debut album in 1972 in California (not released until 1976 and produced by John Cale), and left in February 1974, when Richman wished to perform his songs more quietly. Devastated by the breakup of the band, Harrison returned to Harvard to get his Master&#x27;s degree in architecture.

===Talking Heads===
Harrison joined Talking Heads in 1977, after the release of their debut single, &quot;Love → Building on Fire&quot;. He was offered a spot in the band in 1976, while he was still studying at Harvard. Tina Weymouth phoned Harrison to ask him to come and see Talking Heads play in Boston, not knowing he had already seen them and had been impressed by their material. After the performance, Harrison did not give a precise answer about whether he would join the group. In September 1976, Harrison told Weymouth he would come to New York City to jam with the band, but he did not have enough money to take a bus. He instead helped his friend, former Harvard classmate and Modern Lovers bassist, Ernie Brooks moving a family&#x27;s furniture to New York, hitching a ride with him in the process.

Harrison designed the cover for the band&#x27;s third album in 1979, &quot;Fear of Music&quot;, which received a Grammy nomination for Best Recording Package. Between tours, Harrison started producing records, working with a group called the Escalators in New York and also New Wave soul singer Nona Hendryx. In 1980, &quot;Remain In Light&quot; caused a dispute in the band due to the credits when Harrison was given additional writing credit for &quot;The Overload&quot; and &quot;Houses in Motion&quot; alongside Brian Eno and David Byrne. 

In 1984, Harrison heard a recording on the radio of President Ronald Reagan, apparently from an off-air hot mic soundcheck saying, &quot;My fellow Americans, I&#x27;m pleased to tell you today that I&#x27;ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.&quot; Though many people had heard of the joke, most had never actually heard the recording itself. Believing it summed up the entire Reagan presidency, Harrison tracked down a copy of the tape through a college radio station and then worked with co-producer Daniel Lazerus and funk bassist Bootsy Collins to create a song. &quot;If the song is a hit,&quot; Harrison quipped, &quot;I&#x27;ll be willing to share royalties with &#x27;lyricist&#x27; Ronald Reagan.&quot; When the song, &quot;Five Minutes (Bonzo Goes to Washington)&quot;, was completed, no major label could guarantee a release before the 1984 Presidential election, so Harrison chose micro-label Sleeping Bag Records to release it in October 1984.

===Solo career===
Harrison has released three solo albums. Many have assumed that the title of his debut, &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; in 1981, derived from Stendhal&#x27;s novel of the same name. But in 2021, Harrison revealed that the name was inspired by the group of Situationists. Some members who had come to the United States to join the protests at Harvard against the Vietnam War ended up living in Harrison&#x27;s room and would constantly talk about their philosophy and Wilhelm Reich, which fascinated Harrison. From this time, Harrison remembered a pamphlet that Guy Debord created named &quot;The Red and The Black&quot; and he &quot;just really liked&quot; the title. The main thoughts behind the album were the ideas of communism and anarchism.

In 1988, he created &quot;Casual Gods&quot;, recorded in Milwaukee in a bomb shelter-turned studio by the brother of Harrison&#x27;s best friend in elementary school. During the day Harrison took care of his mother and during the night he worked at the studio. The track &quot;Man with a Gun&quot; was featured in the 1988 film &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot;, and the instrumental version of the same song was used in the 1986 Jonathan Demme film &quot;Something Wild&quot;. The single &quot;Rev It Up&quot; reached a high-point of number seven on the US Mainstream Charts in April 1988; In an interview, Harrison recounts taping the music video with a room full of babies. 

Harrison&#x27;s last solo work was &quot;Walk on Water&quot;, in 1990.

===Post-Talking Heads===
After the 1991 breakup of Talking Heads, Harrison turned to producing and worked on albums by bands including Hockey, Violent Femmes, The BoDeans, The Von Bondies, General Public, Live, Crash Test Dummies, The Verve Pipe, Poi Dog Pondering, Rusted Root, Stroke 9, The Bogmen, Black 47, The Mayfield Four, Of A Revolution, No Doubt, Turkuaz, Josh Joplin Group, The Black and White Years, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Bamboo Shoots, the String Cheese Incident and The Gracious Few. He was also Chairman of the Board for Garageband.com, an internet music resource he co-founded in 1999. As of 2015, Harrison is the founder and chairman of the board at RedCrow, which is a web based direct investment platform that connects financial and human capital to healthcare start-ups as &quot;a community who share knowledge, interest and passion for healthcare innovation.&quot;

In 2021, Harrison joined Turkuaz and Adrian Belew for a series of shows celebrating forty years of the album &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, in his first public performances since the 1996 tour to support &quot;No Talking, Just Head&quot;.

==Film work==
Harrison, as a member of Talking Heads, is featured throughout the 1984 concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, directed by Jonathan Demme. Also during the Talking Heads era, Harrison made cameo appearances as Billy Idol, Kid Creole and Prince look-alike lip-synchers in David Byrne&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;True Stories&quot;. Harrison also had a small part in the 2006 film &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; as &quot;Guy in Bar No. 1&quot; alongside John Doe of the band X.

<text>David Anthony Williams (born June 9, 1980) is a professional poker and &quot;&quot; player who also competed on Season 7 of the FOX cooking show &quot;MasterChef&quot;, where he finished as co-runner-up.

==Personal life==
Williams was born in Arlington, Texas. At 16, he attended the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, a two-year early college entrance program at the University of North Texas. Later, he briefly attended Princeton University before switching to study economics at Southern Methodist University. Williams currently resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. Williams has one daughter, Liliana.

==Poker career==
Williams&#x27;s poker success was capped at the 2004 World Series of Poker. He won his buy-in through an online poker site and made it to the final table of the Main Event, ultimately finishing second to Greg Raymer, but still winning $3.5 million for the runner-up prize. Four months later, he finished second at the Borgata Open World Poker Tour, where he collected $573,800.

===Live===
====Tournaments====
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $7,900,000. $4,317,983 of his live winnings have come at the WSOP, and most of the rest has come from the WPT.

=====World Series of Poker=====
Williams won his sole WSOP bracelet in 2006 in the $1,500 Seven-card stud event when his () defeated John Hoang&#x27;s (). His mother, Shirley Williams, often attends his poker events, and even competed in the 2006 WSOP Main Event, outlasting her son in the process.

=====World Poker Tour=====
In March 2006, Williams made a second WPT final table, finishing 4th for $280,000. Two months later, he made another WPT final table, again finishing 4th. In 2010, he won the WPT World Championship, defeating Eric Baldwin in heads-up play and winning over $1.5 million.

===Online poker===
Following the 2004 World Series of Poker, David Williams became a member of Team Bodog. Williams parted ways with Bodog after the 2010 WPT World Championship. In June 2010, Williams joined Team PokerStars as a sponsored pro.

====Tournaments====
=====World Championship of Online Poker=====
In 2009, Williams, playing under the screen name &quot;RugDoctor&quot;, defeated poker professional Alexander &quot;joiso&quot; Kostritsyn to capture Event #42 ($2,100 8-Game) of the World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP).

==&quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;==
Williams is an accomplished &quot;Magic&quot; player. His initial foray into &quot;Magic&quot;&#x27;s Pro Tour came in the late 1990s. He made the Top 8 of eight Grand Prix events in cities such as San Diego, Cannes, Moscow, and Cleveland with Team Event wins in Yokohama and Taipei in 2001. He also made the top 8 of the first Pro Tour in Japan, finishing 7th at PT Tokyo 2001. He had already won over $30,000 playing &quot;Magic&quot; when he made the Top 8 of the 2001 World Championships in Toronto. However, he was disqualified without prize for marked cards because three of his four Accumulated Knowledge cards were bent more than the other cards in his deck, making them easier to cut to when Williams cut his own deck after his opponent shuffled it. The tournament&#x27;s judging staff determined that the bending was not accidental and that Williams had cheated based on two criteria:
* Each time Williams cut his deck as part of pregame shuffling procedure, a copy of Accumulated Knowledge was on top.
* The judges were able to consistently cut his deck to a copy of Accumulated Knowledge.

Williams admitted that the cards were marked but disputed the determination that he cheated by marking them intentionally. Williams was suspended by the DCI from sanctioned &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; tournaments for one year. During this suspension, Williams started to focus more on Texas hold &#x27;em, especially on the Internet. He made a successful comeback after his suspension was finished, and won money at several more &quot;Magic&quot; events, though his focus was mainly on poker.

Even though there is more money that can be made in professional poker than in professional &quot;Magic&quot;, Williams has said he will continue to play both games, although poker will take precedence. Like many who play both, he has asserted that the two are for different purposes: he plays &quot;Magic&quot; to have fun, and poker to make money.

==&quot;MasterChef&quot;==
Williams competed as a contestant on the seventh season of the United States cooking competition &quot;MasterChef&quot; in 2016. He was one of three contestants to make it into the finals, ultimately losing to Shaun O&#x27;Neale and finishing as co-runner-up with Brandi Mudd. He had six total challenge wins during the season.

<text>David Andrew Platt (born 10 June 1966) is an English retired football coach and player who played as a midfielder.

Born in Chadderton, Lancashire, Platt began his career as an apprentice at Manchester United before moving to Crewe Alexandra, where he began building a reputation as a goal-scoring midfielder. At the age of 22, he signed for Aston Villa and gained the attention of the England manager Bobby Robson, with whom he soon made his debut. At the 1990 World Cup, Platt increased his reputation with his performances, and by scoring goals with his head and feet. According to Rob Bagchi in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Platt &quot;seized Bryan Robson&#x27;s role with riveting aplomb.&quot; His performances in the World Cup earned him a move to Serie A club Bari in 1991.

In 1992, Platt moved to Juventus, where he spent one season. Platt continued scoring goals for England, playing in Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 on home soil. (England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.) In 1993, he moved to Sampdoria where he stayed for two seasons before he returned to England to join Arsenal. Platt was at the London club for three years, featuring in the Arsenal side that won the Premier League and FA Cup Double in 1998.

Platt went on to manage Sampdoria and Nottingham Forest, as well as England&#x27;s Under-21 team. He later became a coach with Manchester City.

==Club career==

===Manchester United and Crewe Alexandra===
Platt signed for Manchester United as an apprentice on leaving school in 1982, having been spotted playing for Chadderton. He accepted manager Ron Atkinson&#x27;s offer of a professional contract at the start of the 1984–85 season, but was given a free transfer on 23 February 1985 without ever playing for the Manchester United first team.

Dario Gradi then signed Platt for Crewe Alexandra in the Fourth Division. He quickly established himself in the first team at Gresty Road as a strong-running, free-scoring midfielder. He played 134 games in the Fourth Division, scoring 55 goals, over the next three years. In the FA Cup, he played three games, scoring one goal. In the League Cup he played four games, scoring four goals.

===Aston Villa===
In February 1988, Platt left Crewe—then still a Fourth Division side—to join Aston Villa for £200,000. He helped his new club earn an instant return to the First Division that season, as runners-up in the Second Division.

He was a frequent goalscorer for Villa, helping re-establish them in the First Division at the end of the 1980s, and in 1989–90 took them to the brink of the league title. Although they had to settle for runners-up spot behind Liverpool, Platt was voted PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year.

The next season, 1990–91, he continued where he left off. In a game against Arsenal he famously went in goal when Nigel Spink was injured in a 5–0 defeat to Arsenal. Platt&#x27;s success with Villa was evident in his goal-scoring record. In more than three years at Villa Park, he played 121 League games, scoring 50 goals. In the FA Cup, he scored two goals in four games, while in the League Cup he scored 10 goals in 14 games. However, his final season at Villa saw the club finish 17th in the league, and he was already being linked with a move to Italy.

===Bari===
On 21 July 1991, Platt moved to Italy to play in Serie A. He signed for A.S. Bari, for £5.5 million, where he was given the captain&#x27;s armband and the number 10 shirt. He played 29 games in his first season, scoring 11 goals. The 1991–92 Serie A season ended in relegation for Bari.

In January 1992, during his time at Bari, Platt received a phone call from Roberto Mancini, who pressed him to come to Sampdoria. &quot;We&#x27;d played Sampdoria a few times and I&#x27;d faced Robbie,&quot; Platt recalls. &quot;But I didn&#x27;t know him and he&#x27;d tracked my number from somewhere. He said: &#x27;I know you&#x27;ve got a good relationship with your president, I&#x27;m sure you could push through a move to us.&#x27;&quot; In the end, Platt chose Juventus.

===Juventus===
In June 1992, Platt was signed for Juventus for £6.5 million. In domestic competitions, Platt struggled to maintain a first-team place in the Juventus team that season. He scored a decisive goal against S.S.C. Napoli in a 4–3 victory, giving the team a chance at the league title.

He also helped the Turin club win the UEFA Cup. Platt was involved in five matches, including one as an unused substitute. Platt scored the only goal away to Panathinaikos as Juventus won the second-round match 1–0 on aggregate. He played in both semi-final legs against Paris Saint-Germain.

Platt was not listed on the substitutes bench, but he picked up a medal as part of the squad and lifted the trophy after the final. In Serie A, he scored three goals in 16 games.

Mancini persisted despite Platt&#x27;s move to Turin. &quot;Every two weeks he would be on the phone, pressing me.&quot; When things quickly failed to work out in Turin, the move Mancini wanted finally did happen. &quot;Juventus played Sampdoria, Robbie was playing, so I was marking him and hovering around him, hoping he would say something,&quot; Platt remembers. &quot;I&#x27;ve always suspected I wasn&#x27;t on Sampdoria&#x27;s list that summer, because their president wanted to sign Marco Osio from Parma but he ran the transfer list past Robbie, who had much of the say. I soon made the move.&quot;

===Sampdoria===
After just one season with Juventus, Platt was soon on the move again. This time he signed for Sampdoria on 14 July 1993 for £5.2 million. Platt won the Coppa Italia in 1994 under Sven-Göran Eriksson. By the time his Italian career came to a close, he was a technically experienced player, possessing dribbling, passing and finishing skills equal to the best. Platt played for exactly two years, until 14 July 1995. He played 55 league games for Sampdoria, scoring 17 goals.

===Arsenal===
After four years in Italy with three different clubs, Platt returned to England on 10 July 1995, when new Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch signed him for £4.75 million. Rioch cut short a holiday in Portugal to bring Platt to Arsenal. Platt had been offered a two-year extension to his contract with Sampdoria, but his mind was soon made up after talking to Rioch in Sardinia, where he was on holiday. &quot;Arsenal made it clear that they really wanted me,&quot; Platt said. &quot;My talks with Bruce Rioch were exceptional. We hit it off straight away. He is a great communicator with some exciting ideas on tactics and a definite view on how he sees me fitting into his plans.&quot; The feelings were mutual. &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to sign a player of David&#x27;s calibre,&quot; Rioch said. &quot;I have admired him for a long time and through these discussions with him I have been very impressed by his knowledge, ambition and desire.&quot;

In his first season, Arsenal finished fifth in the league and qualified for the UEFA Cup, although Rioch was sacked just before the start of the following season due to a dispute with the board, and succeeded by Arsène Wenger. His first season at Highbury produced six goals from his 29 league appearances, with his first goal in an Arsenal shirt coming in a 2–0 win at Everton in the second game of the campaign. Platt was a regular in Wenger&#x27;s first season, the 1996–97 campaign, and scored four goals in 28 league appearances, mainly alongside new signing Patrick Vieira in the centre of the Arsenal midfield. Arsenal were top of the table in late autumn, but eventually had to settle for a third-place finish, seven points behind champions Manchester United.

Wenger boosted his midfield department during the summer of 1997 with the arrival of French pair Emmanuel Petit and Gilles Grimandi. The manager&#x27;s preferred central-midfield pairing was Petit and Vieira, who played a crucial role in Arsenal&#x27;s double-winning campaign. This severely limited Platt&#x27;s appearances and he was to make just eleven starts during the season, with a further 20 substitute appearances. He still managed to make a vital contribution to Arsenal&#x27;s season, however, with a headed winner in a 3–2 victory over Manchester United at Highbury. That proved to be Platt&#x27;s last season with the Gunners as he retired from playing at the end of the season, with the intention of taking a year out from the game to study coaching before making the move into management. His last match was the 1998 FA Cup Final.

Early in the 1997–98 season, Arsenal accepted a £1.5 million bid from Middlesbrough for Platt, but the transfer never happened and Platt saw out the season at Highbury.

===Nottingham Forest===
In July 1999, Platt signed a three-year contract to take over at Nottingham Forest as player-manager, a decision which saw him go back on his plan from a year earlier to retire from playing.

==International career==

===1990 World Cup===
Platt was given his first England cap by Bobby Robson in a friendly against Italy in November 1989, and was then included in the England squad when Robson named his 22-player squad for the 1990 World Cup.

England had been drawn in Group F with Ireland, the Netherlands and Egypt. Platt came on as a substitute against the Irish and the Dutch but remained on the bench for the game against Egypt. England won the group after a 1–1 draw with Ireland, a 0–0 draw with the Dutch and a 1–0 win against Egypt. England qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup knockout stage and were drawn against Belgium. The Belgians dominated the game, hitting the post twice through Enzo Scifo, The game ended 0–0 after ninety minutes. Platt was sent on as an extra-time substitute. In the 120th minute, he scored a volley on the turn from a Paul Gascoigne free-kick, his first goal for his country. Afterwards, and in reflection he said,
&quot;I started as a substitute. I can remember little snatches of the game: John Barnes having a volleyed goal harshly disallowed, Belgium hitting the woodwork twice, I can still see Enzo Scifo hitting the post with a tremendous strike from 25 yards. I was at the other end of the bench from Bobby Robson and didn&#x27;t have much contact with him. Having since been a manager I now know that the emotions he must have been going through were far more intense than mine. I came on for Steve McMahon [in the 71st minute].&quot;

 I had an eye for getting on the end of that sort of ball and the technical ability to finish those chances off. I worked hard on practising overhead kicks and volleys in training at Aston Villa but, even so, if I had re-enacted that chance against Belgium 10 times in training the next day there&#x27;s a very good chance I wouldn&#x27;t have scored once from it. It was just one of life&#x27;s rare, perfect moments.&quot;

&quot;The one place where things didn&#x27;t go right was almost as soon as I left the pitch. One minute I was euphoric and the next I was being hauled off for a random drug test. It was hot and you&#x27;re so dehydrated after playing that it took 40 minutes – which passed very, very slowly – for me to produce a sample. I was in a room with a couple of Belgians who were seriously unhappy because they&#x27;d just been knocked out. I didn&#x27;t know what to say. By the time I came out the other players all had their suits on and the euphoria had passed&quot;.

With captain Bryan Robson having suffered an injury against the Netherlands, Platt started the next game, a quarter-final against Cameroon. He scored the opening goal from a header after a cross from Stuart Pearce on 25 minutes. Cameroon took a 2–1 lead but were beaten 3–2 after extra-time. Platt missed an opportunity to extend England&#x27;s lead, shooting wide with seconds remaining.

Platt kept his place in the semi-final against West Germany. It finished 1–1, and extra-time was needed. Platt had a headed goal disallowed in extra time. The game was drawn and went to a penalty shootout. He scored England&#x27;s third penalty, despite Bodo Illgner, the German goalkeeper, getting a hand to the ball. The next two were not converted and England went out of the tournament.

Platt ended the competition on a high by scoring his third goal of the finals in a 2–1 defeat by Italy in the third-place play-off. Roberto Baggio had given the Italians the lead after a mistake by Peter Shilton. On 81 minutes, Tony Dorigo crossed for Platt to place a powerful header into the corner of the Italian net, past Walter Zenga. Italy won the game when Paul Parker fouled Salvatore Schillaci. Schillaci scored the penalty kick. After the World Cup, he retained his starting place in the England team, now managed by Graham Taylor, his former manager at Villa.

===Euro 1992===
Platt was captain for much of this period, though Tony Adams also skippered the side. The official England history regards him as a tireless runner and tidy passer, leading by quiet example and providing inspiration at a time when it was a rare commodity. At one point, it said: &quot;It seemed as if he had been granted the copyright on England goals&quot;.

For the UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying, England were drawn in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 7 with Ireland, Turkey and Poland. Platt contributed one goal to the qualifying phase, in a 1–1 away draw with the Irish. It was decisive, as England won the group by a single point, eliminating the other three nations. Platt also scored several goals in friendly games. He liked to run from deep midfield positions, arriving late into the penalty area to pick up upon a pass, making it difficult for defenders to pick him up. He scored two goals against the USSR and one against Argentina during the 1991 England Challenge Cup, which England won. Platt also scored against Brazil, and claimed another two against Finland in the lead-up to the tournament.

At Euro 1992 tournament, England were drawn in UEFA Euro 1992 Group 1 with Sweden, France and Denmark. In the opening game, Platt missed several chances to win the game for England. After only 12 minutes, Peter Schmeichel saved a shot at point-blank range, with which Platt was unable to connect properly. The game ended 0–0. In the match against France, Platt nearly scored with a diving header that went inches wide of the post. The game ended 0–0. England needed to beat hosts Sweden to advance to the semi-finals. Lineker crossed for Platt to open the scoring on four minutes with a mis-kicked volley. England held a slender 1–0 lead at half-time. After half-time, the Swedes changed their personnel and formation and dominated the second half, scoring twice to win 2–1. England were eliminated.

===1994 World Cup qualifying===
England were drawn in Group 2 for the 1994 World Cup qualifying, along with Poland, Turkey, San Marino, the Netherlands and Norway.

The qualifiers began at home to Norway. England dominated the game and Platt carried the goal threat, with Alan Shearer and Ian Wright struggling to find form. He scored the opening goal after an hour. England dominated the remainder of the game and but conceded a goal from a long-range shot from Kjetil Rekdal. Platt continued his drive from midfield in wins over Turkey at home (4–0) and San Marino (6–0). Platt scored four goals and missed a penalty against the Sammarinese. He also scored in 2–0 away win against Turkey. John Barnes crossed from a free-kick for Platt to score with a headed goal.

In a crucial home game against the Netherlands, Platt scored the second goal to put England 2–0 up. A defeat would have ended Dutch hopes of qualification after a home draw against Poland and a defeat away to Norway; however, Dennis Bergkamp pulled a goal back before the break. England still controlled the match, but the Dutch scored a penalty four minutes from time for a 2–2 draw. In general, the team struggled to find form in the spring and summer of 1993. England drew 1–1 in Poland, with their opponents missing several glaring chances. Days later, England lost 2–0 to Norway in Oslo. Platt miscontrolled a pass from Gascoigne that would have put him one-on-one with the goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, which, had he scored, would have given England the lead. Thereafter, the Norwegians outplayed the English, and Platt had few chances to make a difference.

In the summer, Platt travelled to the United States with England to take part in the 1993 U.S. Cup, which was supposed to give England crucial experience in a hotter climate. Platt missed the &quot;humiliating&quot; 2–0 loss to the United States through injury. In the second game, he came off the bench to score with his first touch against Brazil, giving England the lead. The game ended 1–1. Platt scored in the final game against Germany, equalising via a passing move with Paul Ince that allowed Platt to tap into an empty net. England lost 2–1.

At the start of the next season England improved, with a 3–0 home win against Poland in which Platt played a part. With two games left, Norway had won the group, leaving England and the Dutch competing for second place in a head-to-head. Both sides had chances and Platt went close to scoring from a corner. With an hour gone, the score was 0–0. Andy Sinton played a through ball that allowed Platt a clear run on goal. Ronald Koeman fouled him just outside the area. The referee failed to send off Koeman. The Dutchman opened the scoring minutes later with a free-kick and England lost the game. England won in San Marino 7–1, but the team finished third in the group and were eliminated. Graham Taylor was sacked. Platt had scored seven of the 29 goals scored by England in the failed campaign.

===Euro 1996===
Graham Taylor&#x27;s replacement, Terry Venables, kept Platt in his squads. Platt scored the first England goal in the Venables era in March 1994 against Denmark, and also netted against Greece and Nigeria. However, a series of rivals arrived to displace him in the England team. He was not helped by a string of injuries to his left knee. Players like Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton emerged, and Venables decided to employ Ince and Gascoigne in central midfield by the time Euro 1996 came around. Platt had to settle for a place on the bench. In the warm-up game against Hungary, he scored his 27th and final goal for his country. This made him the second-highest-scoring midfielder in the history of the England team. Platt&#x27;s goal tally was subsequently surpassed by Frank Lampard.

Platt appeared as a substitute in most of the Euro 1996 games, but he started the quarter-final against Spain, as Ince was suspended. In the semi-final against Germany he started, playing 120 minutes. In the second minute of extra-time, he sent McManaman through on the right side of midfield and he delivered a cross to Anderton, who hit the post. Had it gone in, the golden goal rule would have seen England in the final. The match ended 1–1 at the end of extra time and, once again, penalties decided the winner. As in 1990, Platt scored in a penalty shoot-out against Germany but similarly ended up on the losing side. Platt retired from international football soon afterwards, having been capped 62 times and scored 27 goals. 55 appearances were made as a starting player and seven as substitute.

==Managing and media career==
Within months of leaving Arsenal, Platt returned to Sampdoria as manager, a controversial stint which ended prematurely, with other clubs protesting that Platt did not have the appropriate coaching qualifications for managing in Serie A. Platt resigned before Sampdoria were relegated to Serie B.

In July 1999, Platt was appointed manager of Nottingham Forest, who had just been relegated from the Premier League. He actually made a playing comeback in the 1999–2000 season, playing three Division One games and scoring once against Crystal Palace at the start of the following season.

He was manager at the City Ground for two seasons, but had little success despite spending several million pounds on players who did not perform well and plunging the club into large sums of debt. Platt&#x27;s tenure at Forest was marred by disagreements with several experienced, long-serving players, leading to them being isolated from the first-team picture and subsequently being released by the club. 

Platt was appointed manager of the England U21 on 17 July 2001, which brought a little more success than his stint at Forest. He guided them to qualification for the U-21 European Championships in 2002. He left this role after failing to qualify for the 2004 tournament and was succeeded by Peter Taylor. Platt is now seen as a media pundit often for England U21 matches.

On 1 July 2010, Platt was hired as first-team coach at Manchester City alongside manager (and former teammate) Roberto Mancini, a decision that was not well received by many City fans because of his perceived anti-City stance as a pundit.

He has previously written a regular column for &quot;FourFourTwo&quot;, commenting on tactics.

On 14 May 2013, Platt left his assistant-manager role at Manchester City following the departure of Mancini.

===Pune City===
On 27 May 2015, Platt was announced as the head coach of FC Pune City of the Indian Super League. After one season, Platt was confirmed to not be returning to the Indian club for 2016.

===Palermo===
On 3 December 2018, he was appointed as a club consultant for U.S. Città di Palermo of Italy&#x27;s Serie B following the club takeover by the City Football Group (CFG).

==Personal life==
Platt is fluent in Italian owing to his time playing there.

He is married to Rachel, with whom he had a son in 2006.

In 1993, he shared the cover of &quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot; with Piotr Świerczewski, in the first game in this videogame series.

<text>The Brazilian Grand Prix (), currently held under the name São Paulo Grand Prix (), is a Formula One championship race which is currently held at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in Interlagos neighborhood, Cidade Dutra, São Paulo. The inaugural Brazilian Grand Prix, held in , was held as a non-championship event, with all races from the Brazilian Grand Prix onwards held as a championship event. Previously, the race was held at Jacarepaguá from to , before returning to Interlagos in , where it has since been held.

== Origins ==
Motor racing started in Brazil before World War II, with races on the Gávea street circuit in Rio de Janeiro starting in 1934. In 1936 construction began on Brazil&#x27;s first permanent autodrome in the São Paulo neighborhood of Interlagos and was finished in 1940. Brazil held Grands Prix during the early parts of WWII at Interlagos and Gavea. Interlagos, a circuit inspired in layout by the Roosevelt Raceway in the United States quickly gained a reputation as being a tough and demanding circuit with many challenging corners, elevation changes, a rough surface, and little room for error. 
== Formula One ==
=== Interlagos, São Paulo ===
A Brazilian Grand Prix was first held in 1972 at Interlagos, although it was not part of the Formula One World Championship. Typical of European motorsports at the time, this race was done as a test to convince the FIA if the Interlagos circuit and its organizers could capably hold a Grand Prix. Like most major circuits used for Grands Prix in Latin America such as the Hermanos Rodríguez Autodrome in Mexico City, Interlagos was (and still is) located in the confines of a sprawling urban neighborhood in a very large city. The following year, however, the race was first included in the official calendar, and it was won by defending world champion and São Paulo native Emerson Fittipaldi. In 1974, Fittipaldi won again in rain soaked conditions, and the year after, another São Paulo native, Carlos Pace, won the race in his Brabham, followed by Fittipaldi. 1977 was won by Reutemann, but the drivers began complaining about Interlagos&#x27;s very rough surface, and the event was then relocated for a year to the new Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro.

After a year in Rio, the race returned to Interlagos, with new and upgraded facilities for the next two seasons; this race was won by Jacques Laffite to complete his and Ligier&#x27;s conquest of the opening South American rounds in Argentina and Brazil. But the Interlagos surface was still very bumpy. The original arrangement from 1978 onwards was to alternate the Brazilian Grand Prix between the São Paulo and Rio circuits; the 1980 race was originally supposed to be held at Jacarepaguá but parts of that circuit (which was originally built on a swamp) were beginning to sink into the soft ground and the circuit disintegrated badly, so the 1980 Grand Prix was to be relocated to Interlagos. But by this time, the population of São Paulo had risen from 5 to 8 million over the space of 10 years; the area surrounding the track was becoming increasingly run-down and the circuit did not look good for Formula One, which thanks to worldwide television exposure was becoming something of a glamorous spectacle. Formula One was originally supposed to come back to Interlagos for the 1981 season after the track surface there had been repaved; it turned out that F1 came back a year too early. The drivers were dissatisfied with the safety conditions of the very bumpy Interlagos circuit which had not been changed after the previous year&#x27;s improvements. The ground-effect wing cars of that year had a tendency to bounce up and down thanks to the suction created by the cars&#x27; wing-shaped underbodies, and they were more stiffly suspended than before; so these fragile cars were barely tolerant of such a rough track and were very unpleasant to drive. The bad surface was so rough that the bumps caused mechanical problems for some cars. Also, the barriers and catch-fence arrangements were not adequate enough for Formula One. Jody Scheckter attempted to stop the race from going ahead but this did not work and the race ended up being won by Frenchman René Arnoux. With Formula One&#x27;s more glamorous image being better suited to the better-looking city of Rio de Janeiro, the F1 circus went back to Rio again and the circuit went on to host the 1980s turbo era.

=== Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro ===
In the Brazilian Grand Prix moved to Jacarepaguá in Rio de Janeiro. Argentine Carlos Reutemann dominated in his Ferrari, which was equipped with superior Michelin tyres. This proved to be the French company&#x27;s first victory in Formula One. Reutemann was followed by home favorite Fittipaldi and defending champion Niki Lauda.

After the emergence in 1980 of Rio de Janeiro racer Nelson Piquet, the decline of Interlagos and the retirement of Fittipaldi, Brazilian fans lobbied to host the Brazilian GP in Piquet&#x27;s home town. The flat Jacarepaguá circuit, like Interlagos before it, proved to be extremely demanding: most corners were long and fast, some were slightly banked and the track had a very abrasive surface. Due to the FIA calendar, which invariably had the Brazilian GP at the beginning of the season thus in the Southern hemisphere summer and the tropical weather of Rio, most races were held under very high temperatures and high humidity. Due to all of those circumstances, Grands Prix at Rio were highly demanding and most drivers who won it were exhausted in the end.

In 1981, Carlos Reutemann disobeyed team orders to let his teammate Alan Jones by and took the victory; the following year Piquet finished first and Keke Rosberg finished second but because of the FISA–FOCA war, Piquet and Rosberg were both disqualified for being underweight in post-race scrutineering, and the race victory was given to third placed Alain Prost, who would go on to win at Jacarepaguá four more times (thus earning the nickname &quot;the King of Rio&quot;). The race also saw Italian Riccardo Patrese retire due to physical exhaustion (a very rare occurrence in F1, but quite common at Rio). Piquet won in 1983 and 1986, and the 1988 race was particularly notable, as up-and-coming star Ayrton Senna started from the pit-lane in his first race for McLaren; he began a furious charge that brought him up to second behind his teammate Prost; but he was disqualified for switching to his spare car after the parade lap had begun. The 1989 event was the last race at Jacarepaguá. It was won by British driver Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari, in the first Grand Prix won by a car with a semi-automatic gearbox, and it also saw German Bernd Schneider and American Eddie Cheever collide, and Cheever collapsed twice after he exited his car due to exhaustion.

=== Return to a new Interlagos ===
São Paulo native Ayrton Senna&#x27;s success thus far in Formula One had city officials working hard to revamp the Interlagos circuit in a $15 million investment to shorten and smooth over the circuit. In the Grand Prix returned to a shortened Interlagos, where it has stayed since. The Interlagos circuit has created some of the most exciting and memorable races in recent F1 history, and is regarded as one of the most challenging and exciting circuits on the F1 calendar.

The first race at the new Interlagos in 1990 was won by Alain Prost, who won his 40th career race (the most ever at that point in time) and his sixth Brazilian Grand Prix. It wasn&#x27;t a popular win, as the events of the previous year&#x27;s Japanese Grand Prix were still fresh in the minds of many Brazilians: Prost was seen as having been given the Drivers&#x27; title by FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre at Senna&#x27;s expense after Senna was disqualified from that race in Japan. The Brazilian, a home favorite, finished third in Brazil after leading much of the race but then hitting his backmarker ex-teammate Satoru Nakajima in a Tyrrell. 1991 saw the patriotic Senna emotionally win his first Brazilian Grand Prix. His McLaren&#x27;s manual gearbox was losing gears quickly and close to the end, he only had sixth gear left. This made the car much more difficult and physically demanding to drive, but he still eventually won holding off Williams driver Riccardo Patrese. His exhaustion was so high that had to be extricated from his car. 1992 saw Mansell dominate the weekend and the rest of the season. 1993 was a race of variables; it began to rain heavily early into the race and Prost, now driving a Williams, had a rare accident on the main straight and retired. Senna went on to win in a McLaren from Prost&#x27;s teammate Damon Hill. 1994 saw Senna, now driving for Williams, spin his recalcitrant car going through Juncao late into the race. He was running in second, trying to catch German Michael Schumacher, who went on to win. Senna would lose his life in an accident at the San Marino Grand Prix later in the year. 1995 was a very controversial race that initially had the cars of race winner Michael Schumacher and Britain&#x27;s David Coulthard excluded for apparently using illegal fuel during the race, but then reinstated. 1996 saw Damon Hill win the second race of his championship-winning season. 1997 saw an accident at the start that involved four cars, and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve went off the course at the first corner; the race was stopped and restarted, and Villeneuve jumped into the spare car and won the race. 1998 saw a controversy surrounding McLaren – Ferrari had protested about their braking system, and it was then banned from the Brazilian Grand Prix, although it had been approved four times by FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting. It didn&#x27;t matter much: Finnish McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen won the race anyway. 1999 saw local Rubens Barrichello lead for some time until the engine in his car failed, and Hakkinen won again. In 2000, Barrichello had joined Ferrari and was running second behind his team mate Schumacher (who won at the circuit for the third time) before retiring with a hydraulic failure.
The 2001 Grand Prix was notable for marking the explosive arrival of Juan Pablo Montoya onto the Formula One scene. The Colombian driver stunningly muscled his way past Michael Schumacher early on and led easily until an incident in which Arrows&#x27;s Jos Verstappen ran into the back of his Williams-BMW and ended his race. Montoya did eventually laid to rest the ghost of this event by winning the 2004 race in his final Grand Prix for Williams before moving to McLaren, holding off his future teammate Kimi Räikkönen to take a hard-fought victory. The 2001 race is also notable for two brothers, Michael and Ralf Schumacher, sharing a row on the starting grid for the first time. In 2002 they finished in first and second with Ralf chasing Michael for the victory towards the end of the race.

Particularly memorable recent Brazilian Grands Prix include the 2003 race, which saw a maiden Grand Prix victory, highly unexpectedly, and amidst chaotic and unusual circumstances, for Jordan&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella. Heavy rain before and during the race produced problems with tyre selection which caught out many teams, which allowed the weak Minardi team to have a real chance for victory the only time ever, because they were the only team who prepared for the rainfall, but their drivers were also soon out. And treacherous track conditions caused multiple drivers to spin out of the race, including then-reigning World Champion Michael Schumacher, ending a remarkable run of race finishes dating back to the 2001 German Grand Prix. Amidst this, a number of drivers, including McLaren&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen and David Coulthard, led the race, and, when a heavy accident involving Renault&#x27;s Fernando Alonso blocked the circuit and brought out the red flag, confusion reigned. Fisichella led the race at the time, having just overtaken Räikkönen; however, it was the Finn who was declared the race winner under the rule that stipulated that the race result in such circumstances was to be taken from the running order two laps prior to the race being stopped. This decision was overturned days later in the FIA Court of Appeal in Paris after new evidence came to light which proved that Fisichella had crossed the finish line in the lead for a second time &quot;before&quot; Alonso&#x27;s accident, and therefore was the rightful winner. The 2004 event marked the first time since the race&#x27;s admission to the Formula One Championship calendar that it was not one of the first three rounds of the championship season.

Fernando Alonso became the youngest ever Formula One World Champion at the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix, his third place behind winner Juan Pablo Montoya and championship rival Kimi Räikkönen was enough to clinch the title with two races remaining.

For 2006, the Brazilian Grand Prix, as in 2004, was moved to the prestigious position of hosting the final round of the season, in what was Michael Schumacher&#x27;s first farewell to Formula One, before his return for the season. Starting from 10th position on the grid, Schumacher did an astonishing job on his last race. He fell to 19th position on the ninth lap due to a flat tyre caused by a minor collision with Giancarlo Fisichella when the former was trying to overtake the latter. After pitting for a new tyre he returned to the race, just in front of leader Massa, so almost being lapped, then passing several drivers to take the chequered flag in fourth place, after a dazzling passing manoeuvre on Kimi Räikkönen. His performance was not enough to give Schumacher his eighth trophy, as Fernando Alonso, who needed only one point to become World Champion again, finished in second place. Brazilian Felipe Massa took pole position and led the race from start to finish to get the second victory of his career and to be greeted by celebrations from his Brazilian supporters.

In the 2007 edition, Kimi Raikkonen won the race and his first and only championship, beating both Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton by a single point.

In March 2008, the mayor of São Paulo announced that he had signed a new deal with Bernie Ecclestone to continue the holding of the Brazilian Grand Prix. This deal allowed the Brazilian race to be on the calendar until 2015. With this, Interlagos was set for major improvements in its pit and paddock facilities.

In the final race of the 2008 season in Brazil, Lewis Hamilton became the youngest Formula One World Champion up to that point in Formula One history. After adopting a conservative strategy without risks for most of the race to secure at least fifth place, and the title, a late-race rain shower caused unexpected trouble. First, Hamilton was pushed down to fifth place by German Toyota driver Timo Glock who didn&#x27;t enter the pits for intermediates like most other front runners. With just three laps to go, Sebastian Vettel then also overtook the Briton on the track which meant he would end up with equal points to Massa, but with one fewer victory. While everybody was focusing on the battle between these two (Vettel managed to stay in front in the end), against all expectations both were able to overtake Glock, who had lost all grip with his dry-weather tyres, in the very last corner before the finishing straight. This meant that, while the McLaren Drivers&#x27; Championship title rival Felipe Massa won the race in his Ferrari, Hamilton ultimately grabbed the fifth place he needed to become champion. Renault&#x27;s Fernando Alonso, the previous youngest champion, was second ahead of Massa&#x27;s teammate Kimi Räikkönen and Toro Rosso&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel.

The 2009 race determined another Drivers&#x27; Champion, with Jenson Button in a Brawn finishing fifth to secure his only Drivers&#x27; Championship over Vettel, now driving for Red Bull, who finished fourth; Vettel&#x27;s Australian teammate Mark Webber won the race ahead of Pole Robert Kubica. 2010 saw a wet qualifying and German Nico Hülkenberg drove an astonishing lap to put his non-competitive Williams on pole position. His countryman Vettel won the race ahead of Webber, and this race gave Red Bull the Constructors&#x27; Championship, and it set up a four-way duel for the Drivers&#x27; title at the final round in Abu Dhabi. 2011 saw another Red Bull 1–2, but it was Webber this time who had won from Vettel, who had already won his second Drivers&#x27; title in Japan earlier that year. 2012 was another classic race, where Vettel this time had to do battle with Spanish Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso. After making a very poor start which dropped him to 22nd, he climbed up to sixth which was enough to see him win his third consecutive Drivers&#x27; title. This race was also notable for being Michael Schumacher&#x27;s last ever F1 race: the legendary German had made a comeback with Mercedes in 2010, but he did not win a single race – a huge surprise, considering he was the most successful F1 driver in history. 2013 saw Vettel win his ninth consecutive race that season which was a new record. The record stood until Max Verstappen won his tenth race in a row at the 2023 Italian Grand Prix. 2014 saw the totally dominant Mercedes duo of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton finish 1–2 in the race. 2015 saw Rosberg win again; he had spent most of that season demoralized and at the mercy of his teammate Hamilton, who won his third Drivers&#x27; Championship. 2016 saw continued Mercedes domination, but it was Hamilton who won with Rosberg second. But the Mercedes victory that day was overshadowed by heavy rain, multiple accidents and an astonishing drive from the Dutch teenager Max Verstappen, son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, who drove his Red Bull from 16th to third in 15 laps after his team botched its tyre strategy.

On 10 October 2013 it was announced that the contract for the Brazilian Grand Prix had been extended until 2022, with a further extension in November 2020 that extended it to 2025.

The scheduled 2020 race was cancelled by Formula One Management in July that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving promoters of the Interlagos race furious who say the losses they will make because of this and that it could mean the end of Formula One racing at the venue longer term.

=== São Paulo Grand Prix ===
Formula One would return to Interlagos in the season, with the event now being titled the São Paulo Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton, after a disqualification from qualification due to technical infringements, won the main race after achieving a fifth-place finish in the sprint after a back row start. Hamilton&#x27;s teammate, George Russell, won both races at São Paulo.

Five Brazilian drivers have won the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Emerson Fittipaldi, Nelson Piquet, Ayrton Senna and Felipe Massa each winning twice, and Carlos Pace winning once. The most wins ever is by the Frenchman Alain Prost, who has won the race six times (including five times at Jacarepaguá). Argentine driver Carlos Reutemann and Michael Schumacher have both won four times.

=== Rumours of a return to Rio de Janeiro ===
In spring 2019, Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil, announced that the Brazilian Grand Prix would move back to Rio de Janeiro. Because the Jacarepaguá circuit had been demolished to make way for the construction of facilities for the 2016 Summer Olympics, a new circuit is to be built in the Deodoro neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. However, this was denied by Formula One&#x27;s commercial manager Sean Bratches.

In November 2020 a deal was signed which would see Formula One continue to race at Interlagos until 2025, albeit under the title of São Paulo Grand Prix. This was the first time that the race had been known as the São Paulo Grand Prix. The race&#x27;s contract was suspended in January 2021. Also in January 2021, with official confirmation in February 2021, the newly elected Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, confirmed that the plans for the construction of the new circuit at Deodoro were scrapped, with the promise of finding a new suitable place for its construction.

Formula 1 drivers also expressed their concern for the environment about the project and Lewis Hamilton said, ‘I don’t think it’s a smart move. There is a global crisis with deforestation.’

<text>The Yemen Observer () is an English-language tri-weekly newspaper published in the Republic of Yemen. It was founded in 1996 by Faris Sanabani, aide and press secretary of then Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Its editors include Editor-in-Chief Abdulaziz Oudha, &quot;Yemen Observer&quot;&#x27;s feature writers are Abdulaziz Oudha, Faisal Darem. Since 1996, the &quot;Yemen Observer Publishing House&quot; has diversified dramatically from a single bi-weekly newspaper to a five-armed media institution, publishing both in English and in Arabic: &quot;Yemen Today&quot;. &quot;Yemen Today&quot;, &quot;Arabia Felix&quot;, Sports, and Spectrum are examples for the company&#x27;s fast and successful expansion. 

Today, it has become the first English-speaking publishing house of the country, actively supporting Yemen in its socio-economic transition.

It also launched magazine &quot;Yemen Today&quot; is the most dynamic branch of the Publishing House, promoting investment and tourism in Yemen, a country which has promising potential in this field.

==2006 cartoon thumbnails and blasphemy trial==
On 4 February 2006, the &quot;Yemen Observer&quot; published two articles on Muslim reactions to the Danish cartoons depicting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The articles were accompanied by photographs showing 20-30,000 Yemeni women demonstrating against the cartoons, and empty shelves in a Sana’a supermarket with a sign informing customers that Danish products had been withdrawn. Also included were crossed-out thumbnail images of three of the Danish cartoons.

On 11 February 2006, former chief editor Mohammed Al-Asadi was arrested on charges of offending Islam. He was released on bail on 22 February 2006. In a trial that began on 23 February 2006, prosecution lawyers called for al-Asadi to be sentenced to death, for the paper to be closed and for all of its assets to be confiscated. Al-Asadi denied all charges and his defence team argued that the thumbnail images were accompanied by articles that condemned the cartoons and reported reactions from across the Islamic world. The prosecution claimed that the charges rested on the pictures alone, and that the accompanying articles should not be taken into account. After his release, Al-Asadi founded the &quot;Yemen Mirror&quot;. 

During the trial and for nearly six months afterward, the &quot;Yemen Observer&quot; had its license to publish suspended by Yemen&#x27;s Ministry of Information, but its staff continued to produce material and publish it on the paper&#x27;s website.

==Yemen&#x27;s Revolution==
The outbreak of the Yemeni revolution in Yemen on 3 February 2011 affected the &quot;Yemen Observer&quot;, too. Particularly critical articles on the policy of Ali Abdullah Saleh and the often violent and brutal crackdowns on unarmed demonstrators brought trouble to the journalists.

==Geography==

The Liverpool Plains have a generally flat to undulating terrain formed from the remnants of old volcanoes such as that of the Liverpool Ranges to the southwest. To the south and east, it merges into the higher and cooler Northern Tablelands.

The Liverpool Plains is generally regarded as the richest agricultural region in Australia owing to its rich black soils, which originally supported a mixed grassland vegetation containing both annual and perennial grasses, which early in the region&#x27;s history were used to feed cattle and sheep.

Wheat and cotton are the chief crops, although production fluctuates wildly according to rainfall and soil erosion is a major problem occurring both after droughts and floods. The climate is hot in summer, mild in winter, and of moderate rainfall. The average is generally around with a slight summer maximum, but is quite erratic and can vary from in very wet years to as little as . Temperatures in summer frequently exceed and make cropping without irrigation risky without sophisticated meteorological forecasting techniques.

<doc id="718792" wikidata="Q1626201" url="?curid=718792" title="List of prime ministers of Elizabeth II">
<text>From becoming queen on 6 February 1952, Elizabeth II was head of state of 32 independent states; at the time of her death, there were 15 states, called Commonwealth realms. Within the Westminster system in each realm, the Queen&#x27;s government was headed by a prime minister. Appointment and dismissal of prime ministers were common reserve powers that could be exercised by Elizabeth or her governors-general.

Elizabeth had 179 individuals serve as her realms&#x27; prime ministers throughout her reign, the first new appointment being Dudley Senanayake as Prime Minister of Ceylon and the final being Liz Truss as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, whom she appointed only two days before her death; some of these individuals served multiple non-consecutive terms in office (within the same state) as prime minister. Several of her prime ministers from various realms were appointed for life to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

This list does not cover Commonwealth nations that were not Commonwealth realms at any point during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, nor holders of offices of prime minister in colonies or sub-national entities such as states or provinces.

==Anomalous cases==
===Grenada (1979–1984)===
Maurice Bishop held &quot;de facto&quot; government control for most of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government period (from 13 March 1979 until 14 October 1983). On 14 October 1983 Bishop was deposed by Bernard Coard and Bishop was killed on 19 October. Coard held power only briefly before military government was declared. After the invasion of Grenada by the United States, the pre-revolutionary system of government and the office of Prime Minister were restored on 4 December 1984. The Grenadian government acknowledges Bishop as a former prime minister, but not Coard nor any other individual who held &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot; power in this period.

===Rhodesia (1965–1970)===
Ian Smith was Prime Minister of Rhodesia following a unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Although Rhodesia considered Elizabeth II to be &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot;, this title was not accepted by her. Acting in his vice-regal capacity and under direction from the UK government, the Governor of Southern Rhodesia, Humphrey Gibbs, dismissed the prime minister and his government but this action was ignored by Smith. The state remained unrecognised by the United Kingdom and the wider international community. Following a referendum, Rhodesia declared itself a republic on 2 March 1970. Smith remained in office throughout this period.

==Notes==

# The occurrence of some anomalous cases means there is a small degree of ambiguity to this figure.
# After Christie suffered a stroke Cynthia A. Pratt served as acting prime minister from 4 May to 22 June 2005.
# Due to the Sandline affair, Chan resigned as prime minister on 27 March 1997 and Giheno took over as acting Prime Minister. He regained the position on 2 June 1997, shortly before being ousted in a general election.
# For two periods in this term of Somare&#x27;s premiership Sam Abal was acting prime minister.
# See 2011–12 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis for details on the dispute between Somare and O&#x27;Neill as to legitimately held the position of prime minister in this time. This period of ambiguity spans the time between the later-disputed dismissal of Somare from office and the implementation of the results of the 2012 general election.
# Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.
# Telavi was removed from office on 1 August 2013. Sopoaga briefly served as acting prime minister before being sworn in as prime minister on 5 August 2013
# A constitutional change ended Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign in Uganda on 9 October 1963 though Uganda did not formally use the term &quot;Republic&quot; until 1966.

<doc id="718796" wikidata="Q777779" url="?curid=718796" title="Awsan">
<text>The Kingdom of Awsan, commonly known simply as Awsan (; ), was a kingdom in Ancient South Arabia, centered around a wadi called the Wadi Markha. The wadi remains archaeologically unexplored. The name of the capital of Awsan is unknown, but it is assumed to be the &quot;tell&quot; that is today known as Hagar Yahirr (locally named Ḥajar Asfal), the largest settlement in the wadi. Hagar Yahirr was 15 hectares and surrounded by an irrigated area of nearly 7,000 hectares, indicating that it was a formidable power in its time. The main god of Awsan was called Balu (&quot;blw&quot;).

The Kingdom of Awsan experienced two main periods of activity. The first began in the 8th century BC, and in this time, Awsan was militarily allied with the Kingdom of Saba and, together, launched campaigns against common enemies. In the late 7th century BC, this alliance changed into a rivalry and Saba, under Karib&#x27;il Watar, obliterated Awsan, then ruled by a king named Murattaʿ. The later kingdom of Awsan experienced a resurgence around or after the 2nd century BC, its independence waning and waxing against Qatabanic control of the area.

== History ==

=== 8th century BC ===
In the 8th century BC, Awsan was allied to the Kingdom of Saba. Documents have been found dedicated to the gods and commemorating the brotherhood between the states. Together, Saba and Awsan undertook a successful military ventures against Qataban during the reign of the Sabaean king, Yatha&#x27; Amar Watar. The venture was successful, and Saba imposed itself on Qataban as a result. Another continuity between the kingdoms was the use of the title mukarrib to designate their leader, and it is not known which one borrowed it from the other. There is also evidence that Awsan also had contacts with the Jawf valley in the 8th century BC.

=== Destruction ===
In the late 7th century BC, the alliance with Saba had become a rivalry. During the reign of the Sabaean leader Karib&#x27;il Watar, the Kingdom of Awsan was destroyed by Saba and its allies (cities from the Jawf including Nashshan and Haram). Karba&#x27;il&#x27;s victory is recorded in a lengthy inscription known as RES 3945, which records eight campaigns undertaken during his reign, the second of which concerned Awsan. The tribal elite leading Awsan were slaughtered, and the palace of Murattaʿ was destroyed, as well as their temples and inscriptions. The wadi was depopulated, which is reflected in the abandonment of the wadi. Sabaean inscriptions claim that 16,000 were killed and 40,000 prisoners were taken. This may not have been a significant exaggeration, as the Awsan kingdom disappeared as a political entity from the historical record for five or six centuries.

The summary of the second campaign in the inscription reads:When he crushed Awsān, killed sixteen thousand [16000] of them, captured forty thousand [40000]; devastated *Wusr from Lagiʾatum to Ḥammān; burnt all the cities of *Anfum; put to the torch all the cities of Ḥabbān and of *Dhayb; 5 devastated their irrigated zones; laid waste to Ns¹m, the irrigated area of Rs²ʾy, and Girdān; crushed {Awsān} in Datīnat and burnt all its cities; obliterated *Tafīḍ, destroyed it, put it to the torch, and laid waste to its irrigated areas; overwhelmed {Awsān} until reaching the coast, burnt all of its ci[ties] which lie by the coast; crushed {Awsān} in *Wusr, until routing Awsān and *Murattiʿ um its king, inflicting as punishment {the delivery} of the council chiefs of Awsān to S¹mht and inflicting as punishment 6 massacre and captivity; brought back the looting of his palace Miswar and removed all the inscriptions which [Karib]ʾīl seized {‘inflicted as punishment’} in his palace Miswar and the inscriptions of his deities’ temples; ...[18 letters] ... his palace Miswar; has caused to enter among the offspring of *Almaqah and his allies—his freemen and his serfs—{people} of the various territories of Awsān and of its cities, assigned to *Almaqah and to Sabaʾ S¹rm and its provinces, and Ḥmdn and its provinces, provided with an enclosure the 7 cities of S¹rm, had their irrigated areas cultivated and established Sabaʾ there.There is also evidence that Saba, after defeating Awsan, divided the territory between two of its other allies at the time: Qataban and Hadhramaut. There is evidence that Awsan retained its individuality in these later centuries, at least in the area under Qatabanian control.

=== Brief resurgence ===
When the ability of Qataban to project control over the Wadi Markha declined, the Kingdom of Awsan experienced a resurgence and regained its autonomy for at least a few decades. The timing of this event is unclear. Christian J. Robin proposes a timing in the 2nd century BC, with Jeremie Schiettecatte putting it in the 1st century BC. An extension of this phase into the first centuries AD cannot be ruled out: a 2nd century AD inscription from Saba mentions a war declared against Awsan, but not all are convinced that this data requires the existence of an Awsanite kingdom at the time. This is also the only place and time in the history of ancient South Arabian culture where the king was deified: the only known South Arabian king deified after their death was the Awsanite king Yaṣdaqʾil Farʿam Šarḥiʿat. Some kings from this era are known. Their statues show an iconographic evolution. The earliest kings are shown wearing typical South Arabian clothing, but the last one known is depicted as a Roman citizen, with curly hair and wearing a toga. 

== Capital ==

Hagar Yahirr was the center of an exceptionally large city for South Arabia, influenced by Hellenistic culture, with temples and a palace structure surrounded by mudbrick dwellings, with a probable site for a &quot;souq&quot; or market and a caravanserai serving camel caravans. One of its kings at this period was the only Yemeni ruler to be accorded divine honours; his surviving portrait statuette is dressed in Greek fashion, contrasting with those of his predecessors who are dressed in Arabian style, with kilt and shawl. There are Awsān inscriptions, in the Qatabānian language.

The siting of Ḥajar Yaḥirr is consistent with other capitals of petty kingdoms, at the mouths of large wādīs: Ma`īn in the Wādī al-Jawf, Ma&#x27;rib in Wādī Dana, Timna in Wādī Bayhān, and Shabwah in Wādī &#x27;Irmah.

== Religion ==
The main god of Awsan was called Balu (&quot;blw&quot;).

One oracular temple called Nuʿmān is known from Awsan. It was in operation in the 1st century AD, with the oracular god being Wadd.

<doc id="718797" wikidata="Q309792" url="?curid=718797" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter">
<text>The de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter is a single-engined, high-wing, propeller-driven, short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft developed by de Havilland Canada. It was conceived to be capable of performing the same roles as the earlier and highly successful Beaver, including as a bush plane, but is overall a larger aircraft.

==Design and development==
The rugged single-engined, high-wing, propeller-driven DHC-3 Otter was conceived in January 1951 by de Havilland Canada as a larger, more powerful version of its highly successful DHC2 Beaver STOL utility transport. Dubbed the &quot;King Beaver&quot; during design, it would be the veritable &quot;one-ton truck&quot; to the Beaver&#x27;s &quot;half-ton&quot; role.

The Otter received Canadian certification in November 1952 and entered production shortly thereafter. Using the same overall configuration as the Beaver, the new, much heavier design incorporated a longer fuselage, greater-span wing, and cruciform tail. Seating in the main cabin expanded from six to 10 or 11. Power was supplied by a 450-kW (600 hp) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 geared radial. The version used in the Otter was geared for lower propeller revolutions and consequently lower airspeed. The electrical system was 28 volts D.C.

Like the Beaver, the Otter can be fitted with skis or floats. The Otter served as the basis for the very successful Twin Otter, which features two wing-mounted Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6 turboprops. A total of 466 Otters were manufactured.

==Operational use==


The DHC-3/CC-123/CSR-123 Otter was used until 1980 by the Royal Canadian Air Force and its successor, the Air Command of the Canadian Forces. It was used in Search and Rescue, as the &quot;CSR&quot; denotes Canadian Search (and) Rescue (type 123) and as a light utility transport, &quot;CC&quot; denoting Canadian Cargo. 
During the Suez Crisis, the Canadian government decided to provide assistance to the United Nations Emergency Force and the Royal Canadian Navy carrier carried 4 Otters from Halifax to Port Said in Egypt early in 1957, with all four flying off unassisted while the ship was at anchor. This was the only occasion when RCAF fixed wing aircraft operated from a Canadian warship.
It was also operated on EDO floats on water and skis for winter operations on snow. The EDO floats also had wheels for use on runways (amphibious). It was used as army support dropping supplies by parachute, and also non-parachute low-speed, low-altitude air drops, to support the Canadian Army on manoeuvres. In the end it was operated by the Primary Air Reserve in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Winnipeg, with approximately 10 aircraft at each base, as well as by the RSU (Regular (Forces) Support Units) at those bases. It was usually flown with a single pilot (Commissioned Officer) in the left seat and a Technical Air Crewman (NCO) in the right seat. The Kiowa helicopter replaced it in Air Reserve squadrons.

Although the Otter found ready acceptance in bush airlines, as in a similar scenario to the DHC-2 Beaver, the United States Army soon became the largest operator of the aircraft (184 delivered as the U-1A Otter). Other military users included Australia, Canada, and India, but the primary role of the aircraft as a rugged bush plane continues to this day.

An Otter crossed the South Pole in 1957 (see Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition). The Otter is also popular in the skydiving community and can be found in many drop zones throughout the world.

Otters were used by Qantas from 1958 to 1960 in Papua New Guinea. The Qantas aircraft were then transferred to Trans Australian Airlines (TAA), a major Australian domestic airline, which operated the Otters in Papua New Guinea until 1966 when they were withdrawn from use. TAA was merged with Qantas in 1990.

===Modifications===
The most extensively modified Otter was RCAF Otter &quot;3682&quot;. After initial service as a standard Search and Rescue aircraft it was used to explore the aerodynamic aspects of STOL. In 1958, it was fitted with flaps so outsized that, with their 45 degree droop, it became known as the Batwing Otter. In addition, its tail-wheel undercarriage was replaced with a high energy-absorption 4-wheel arrangement and a very high vertical tail. The next modification replaced the flaps with fully retractable flaps suitable for cruising flight and high drag was obtained with reverse thrust from a J85 turbojet installed in the fuselage behind the cockpit. The third configuration looked a lot like the future Twin Otter and was the first twin-PT6 fixed-wing installation to fly in May 1963 (A twin PT6-engined helicopter, the Kaman K-1125, had flown in April 1963). The piston engine in the nose was replaced with wing-mounted engines to blow over the flaps.
Stolairus Aviation of Kelowna, BC, has developed several modifications for the DHC-3 including a STOL Kit, which modifies the wing with a contoured leading edge and drooped wingtips for increased performance. Stolairus has also developed a &quot;upgross&quot; kit which increases the gross weight of the DHC-3 to on floats.

Some aircraft were converted to turbine power using a PT6A, Walter 601 (manufactured in the Czech Republic), or Garrett/Honeywell TPE331-10, by Texas Turbine Conversions. The Walter M601E-11 Turbine Engine conversion is manufactured and installed by Stolairus Aviation.

A Polish PZL radial engine has also been fitted. Re-engined aircraft have been offered since the 1980s by Airtech Canada as the DHC-3/1000 using current-production 1,000 hp (745 kW) PZL ASz-62 IR radials.

==Accidents==
As of June 2019, there have been 119 incidents and accidents involving the DHC-3 resulting in 242 deaths. Listed below are a select few of the most notable ones.

*In 1956, two military Otters broke up in mid-air. One had taken off from Downsview and the other from Goose Bay. The Otter requires immediate use of elevator trim to counteract the strong change in pitch caused by the retraction or extension of the flaps. Investigators found that metal contamination in a hydraulic valve allowed the flaps to rapidly retract with the tailplane still fully trimmed, and the consequent nose drop was severe enough to cause structural failure. A filter was added to the flap hydraulic system and an interconnection added between the flaps and tailplane to maintain proper trim as the flaps are operated.
*On 22 June 1994, a DHC-3 Otter floatplane, N13GA, registered to and operated by Wings of Alaska of Juneau, Alaska, crashed into the Taku Inlet, 12 miles east of Juneau. The air taxi flight had departed the Taku Lodge located on the Taku River bound for the Juneau downtown dock. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Six passengers were killed, one passenger was missing and presumed dead, and the pilot and three passengers received serious injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to continued VFR into IMC and the pilot&#x27;s consequent failure to maintain altitude above the water surface.
*On 9 August 2010, a DHC-3T registered to Anchorage-based GCI crashed about north of Dillingham, Alaska, while en route to a private fishing lodge. Five of the nine people on board were killed, including former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. Surviving passengers included former NASA administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe and his teenage son, both of whom sustained injuries.
*On 23 September 2011, a DHC-3T Turbine Otter floatplane, N361TT, sustained substantial damage during a go-around and subsequent low-altitude maneuver at Heitman Lake, about 5 miles south-southwest of Kodiak, Alaska, killing the pilot and injuring the two passengers. One of the passengers reported that during the go-around, the airplane struck a tree on the shoreline and crashed.
*On 7 July 2013, a DHC-3 Otter registered to Rediske Air, N93PC, crashed on takeoff at Soldotna Airport, Alaska, killing all ten aboard. There were no surviving witnesses and the aircraft did not carry a flight data recorder, but the NTSB was able to reconstruct the aircraft&#x27;s flight path using a recovered mobile phone video recorded by a passenger. The NTSB attributed the accident to a stall caused by the operator&#x27;s failure to weigh cargo and verify that the aircraft was loaded within its center of gravity limits.
* On 25 June 2015, a Promech Air DHC-3 Otter crashed into the face of a granite cliff near Ella Lake, Alaska, 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Ketchikan. The aircraft carried a pilot and eight passengers who were tourists on a sightseeing excursion from a Holland America Line coastal cruise aboard the cruise ship MS &quot;Westerdam&quot;. All nine people on board died. The NTSB determined that the pilot had a history of poor decision making and that the company had a compromised culture that resulted in an &quot;operation in which safety competed with performance and revenue&quot;.
* On 15 September 2015, a DHC-3 Turbine Otter floatplane carrying ten people and belonging to Rainbow King Lodge crashed on takeoff at Eastwind Lake, mile north of Iliamna, southwest of Anchorage. Three people were killed in the crash.
* On 13 May 2019, in the 2019 Alaska mid-air collision, a Taquan Air DHC-3 Turbine Otter floatplane, N959PA, collided with a Mountain Air Service DHC-2 Beaver, N952DB, over George Inlet, Alaska, with the loss of one passenger aboard the DHC-3 and five passengers and crew aboard the DHC-2. The NTSB attributed the accident to the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, along with the absence of alerts from both airplanes&#x27; traffic display systems.&quot; Due to the angle of approach, both pilots&#x27; viewpoints were partially blocked by the aircraft structure or seated passengers. The NTSB identified Taquan&#x27;s inadequate preflight checklist and the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s failure to require Taquan to implement a safety management system as contributing factors.
* On 4 September 2022, a DHC-3 floatplane operated by Friday Harbor Seaplanes, N725TH, crashed in Puget Sound near Whidbey Island, Washington, killing all ten aboard the aircraft. On October 24, the NTSB announced that the horizontal stabilizer actuator had separated into two pieces at a threaded assembly fitting, and that the actuator lock ring was missing from the wreckage. The next day, Viking Air issued a service letter requiring DHC-3 Otter operators to inspect their aircraft and ensure that the actuator&#x27;s lock ring is present.

<text>The Frontier Post is an independent English language daily newspaper founded in Peshawar, Pakistan, in 1985. It publishes from Peshawar, Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi, and Quetta.

==History==
When the paper was founded in 1985, there were no prominent journalists based in the area, and its original editor Aziz Siddiqi was neither an ethnic Pukhtoon (the dominant population of Peshawar) nor from a Pukhtoon area. Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governor Fazle Haq along with several entrepreneurs were engaged in founding the paper.

The founder, chief editor and publisher, Rehmat Shah Afridi, has been termed a &quot;prisoner of conscience&quot; by Amnesty International due to his longstanding struggle for democracy and media freedom in Pakistan; Afridi was arrested in 1999. Jalil Afridi had been running The Frontier Post as its Managing Editor since 1999.

<text>Delonix regia is a species of flowering plant in the bean family Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae native to Madagascar. It is noted for its fern-like leaves and flamboyant display of orange-red flowers over summer. In many tropical parts of the world it is grown as an ornamental tree. It is a non-nodulating legume.

Although its country of origin was unknown, it had been in widespread cultivation for centuries. Finally, in 1932, a natural colony was discovered on the west coast of Madagascar by J. Leandri.

== Common names ==
Its common names include &quot;flame tree&quot; (one of several species given this name), peacock flower, royal poinciana, flamboyant, phoenix flower, flame of the forest. The name &quot;poinciana&quot; comes from a genus it was once placed in named &quot;Poinciana&quot; after Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, a French noble who once governed the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts.

== Description ==
&quot;Delonix regia&quot; is a medium-sized deciduous tree that grows to about . The bark is light brown. Often creased at branches, it has prominent lenticels. The foliage of one branch is made of 8-25 or more pairs of pinnae, each pinna is lined with 30-60 or more opposite leaflets. One leaflet is oblong with a length of 4-12 millimetres, it is dark green with a dull upper surface and a paler, greyish bottom. 

The flowers are large, with four spreading scarlet or orange-red petals forming a diameter up to long, and a fifth upright petal called the standard, which is slightly larger and spotted with yellow and white. They appear in corymbs along and at the ends of branches. The naturally occurring variety &quot;flavida&quot; (Bengali: &quot;Radhachura)&quot; has yellow flowers.

The pods are green and flaccid when young, then turn dark-brown and woody as they mature. They can be up to long and wide. The seeds are small, weighing around on average. The compound (doubly pinnate) leaves have a feathery appearance and are a characteristic light, bright green. Each leaf is long with 20 to 40 pairs of primary leaflets or pinnae, each divided into 10–20 pairs of secondary leaflets or pinnules. Pollen grains are elongated, approximately 52 μm in size.

In India, the trees are bare during the winter months from December to February. New leaves start to form in March-April. Flowers start to appear in April, reaching full bloom in May. Fruit pods are present for many months.

==Distribution==
&quot;Delonix regia&quot; is endemic to Madagascar&#x27;s dry deciduous forests, but has been introduced into tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. In the wild it is endangered, but it is widely cultivated elsewhere and is regarded as naturalised in many of the locations where it is grown.

===Africa===
Trees are planted along streets and villages within Madagascar as an ornamental. Aside this, it is present in several Southern African countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Namibia. 

===North America===

In the continental United States, it grows in South Florida, Central Florida, in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas and can be found planted as far north as Houston. Hawaii is another location where the species is grown. It also grows in humid parts of Mexico, especially in the southwest states like Campeche, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Tabasco, Veracruz, and Yucatán.

===Caribbean and Central America===
In the Caribbean it is featured in many Dominican and Puerto Rican paintings. It can also be found in Belize, The Bahamas, Costa Rica, Cuba, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Sint Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, the Cayman Islands, Grenada, Jamaica, Curaçao, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Saint Lucia. It is the national flower of St. Kitts and Nevis. It can also be found in Bermuda. The town of Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, located about west of Ponce, is nicknamed &quot;El Valle de los Flamboyanes&quot; (&quot;The Valley of the Poinciana Trees&quot;), as many flamboyant trees are found along the surrounding Río Guayanes, Río Macana, and Río Tallaboa rivers.

===South America===
It grows in Paraguay and Brazil.

===Europe and the Middle East===

&quot;Delonix regia&quot; is planted in Mediterranean parts of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, including the southern coast of Spain, the Valencian coast, the Canary Islands, Lebanon, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Cyprus and Saudi Arabia.
===Indian subcontinent===

The tree is planted in India, where it is referred to as the &quot;May-flower tree&quot;, &quot;Gulmohar&quot; or &quot;Gul Mohr&quot;. In West Bengal and Assam it is called &quot;Krishna Chura&quot; (কৃষ্ণচূড়া), while its known as &quot;Nianbānā/Krushnachuṛā&quot; (ନିଆଁବାନା/କୃଷ୍ଣଚୂଡ଼ା) in Odisha. In Sri Lanka it is known in Sinhala as the &quot;Maara tree&quot;, although for a short while it was known as the &quot;Lamaasuriya tree&quot; after Le Mesurier, the British civil servant who was responsible for introducing it as a shade tree. It is also grown in Karachi, Pakistan. In Mauritius and La Réunion it announces the coming of the new year.

In Bangladesh it is known as krisnachura (কৃষ্ণচূড়া). You can find this tree in various places in Bangladesh. It is found all over Dhaka City and is one of the iconic symbols of the Bengali month of Boishakh. In Nepal it is known as Shirish.

===Southeast Asia===
In Myanmar, where it is called &quot;sein pan&quot; (), the time of flowering is March in the south and early to late April in the north. It is planted in gardens and as a roadside tree. In Myanmar, this tree is a sign of the Thingyan Festival (13–16/17 April). In the Philippines, its flowering signals the imminent arrival of the monsoon rains. It also grows in Thailand and Indonesia. In Vietnam it is called &quot;phoenix flower&quot; and mostly grows in Haiphong. In Malaysia, it is called &quot;Semarak&quot;, which used to be the name of a street in the country&#x27;s capital city, Kuala Lumpur, now renamed as Jalan Sultan Yahya Petra where one of the oldest and highest ranked Malaysian universities, the University of Technology Malaysia&#x27;s Kuala Lumpur campus is located. &quot;Semarak Api&quot; is also the official flower of the Sepang district.

===East Asia===
It grows in Southern China such as in Hong Kong. It is the official tree in Tainan, Taiwan; Xiamen, Fujian Province, and Shantou, Guangdong Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. National Cheng Kung University, a university located in Tainan, included royal poinciana on its emblem.

===Australia===
It is very widely grown in Northern Australia, in the southern extremes previously limited to South East Queensland where it is a popular street tree in the suburbs of Brisbane. It blooms successfully in Sydney and other parts of New South Wales.

===Micronesia===
It grows in Guam, and is the official tree of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

==Cultivation==
===Required conditions===
The royal poinciana requires a tropical or near-tropical climate, but can tolerate drought and salty conditions. It thrives in open, free-draining sandy or loamy soil enriched with organic matter. The tree does poorly in heavy or clay soils, and flowers more profusely when kept slightly dry.

===Propagation===
====Seeds====

The royal poinciana is most commonly propagated by seeds. Seeds are collected, soaked in warm water for at least 24 hours, and planted in warm, moist soil in a semi-shaded, sheltered position. In lieu of soaking, the seeds can also be &quot;nicked&quot; or &quot;pinched&quot; (with a small pair of scissors or nail clipper) and planted immediately. These two methods allow moisture to penetrate the tough outer casing, stimulating germination. The seedlings grow rapidly and can reach in a few weeks under ideal conditions.

====Cuttings====
Less common, but just as effective, is propagation by semi-hardwood cuttings. Branches consisting of the current or last season&#x27;s growth can be cut into sections and planted in a moist potting mixture. This method is slower than seed propagation (cuttings take a few months to root) but is the preferred method for ensuring new trees are true to form. As such, cuttings are a particularly common method of propagation for the rarer yellow-flowering variety of the tree.

===Uses===
In addition to its ornamental value, it is a useful shade tree in tropical conditions, because it usually grows to a modest height (mostly , but it can reach a maximum height of ) but spreads widely, and its dense foliage provides full shade. In areas with a marked dry season, it sheds its leaves during the drought, but in other areas it is virtually evergreen.

==Cultural significance==
In the Indian state of Kerala, royal poinciana is called &quot;kaalvarippoo&quot; (, ) which means &quot;the flower of Calvary&quot;. There is a popular belief among Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala that when Jesus was crucified, there was a small royal poinciana tree nearby his Cross. It is believed that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed over the flowers of the tree and this is how the flowers of royal poinciana got a sharp red color. It is also known as &quot;Vaaga&quot; in many areas of Kerala.

Its blossom is the national flower of St. Kitts and Nevis, and in May 2018 the royal poinciana was adopted by the city of Key West as its official tree. Known locally as , &quot;Delonix regia&quot; is the city flower of Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia.

In Vietnam, this is a popular urban tree and is called , or &quot;phoenix&#x27;s tail&quot;. Its flowering season is May–July, which coincides with the end of the school year in Vietnam. Because of this timing, the flower of poinciana is sometimes called the &quot;pupil&#x27;s flower&quot;. The tree is also commonly found on school grounds in Vietnam; however, after several incidents where a tree fell onto students, with one student killed, schools started cutting down or severely pruning the trees. Hải Phòng is nicknamed (&quot;City of red poinciana&quot;).

The song &quot;Poinciana&quot; was inspired by the presence of this tree in Cuba.

In South India, these trees are common in schools, so children used to play with the stamens of the bud.

<text>Marián Gáborík (; born 14 February 1982) is a Slovak former professional ice hockey right winger. He began his playing career in the Slovak Extraliga with Dukla Trenčín for two seasons before being drafted third overall in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild, becoming the highest-drafted Slovak player in National Hockey League (NHL) history until Juraj Slafkovský, who was drafted 1st overall by the Montreal Canadiens in 2022. Gáborík was the Wild&#x27;s first-ever draft pick and would score the team&#x27;s first-ever regular season goal.

Gáborík spent eight seasons with the Wild from 2000 to 2009, becoming the team&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer, before signing with the New York Rangers in 2009. He has also played for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Los Angeles Kings, and Ottawa Senators in the NHL until retiring in 2018. Gáborík won the Stanley Cup with the Kings, defeating his former team, the Rangers, in the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals.

Internationally, Gáborík was a two-time Olympian with Slovakia and won a bronze medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships.

==Playing career==
===Dukla Trenčín (1998–2000)===
Gáborík played with Dukla Trenčín&#x27;s junior team and scored 59 points over 36 games in 1997–98. That same season, he appeared in one Slovak Extraliga game with Dukla Trenčín&#x27;s men&#x27;s team, scoring a goal in his professional debut. The following season, in 1998–99, he joined Dukla Trenčín in the Slovak Extraliga full-time and registered 20 points over 33 games as a rookie. Gáborík then improved to 46 points in 50 games the following season in his draft year.

===Minnesota Wild (2000–2009)===
Gáborík was the first-ever draft pick for the expansion Minnesota Wild, drafted with the third overall pick in the first round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft after Rick DiPietro and Dany Heatley. Gáborík immediately showed promise during his rookie season with the Wild, scoring the team&#x27;s first ever regular season goal en route to collecting 18 goals and 36 points for the expansion Wild. He elevated his game the following season, in 2001–02, notching his first 30-goal season and nearly doubling his rookie output to 67 points. He also recorded his first career NHL hat-trick near the beginning of the season on 13 November 2001. In 2002–03, Gáborík was named to his first NHL All-Star Game and won the fastest skater competition, lapping the rink in 13.713 seconds. He notched 30 goals for the second consecutive season, but more importantly helped lead the Wild to their first Stanley Cup playoffs appearance. He capped off his third NHL season with 17 points in 18 games as part of a run to the Western Conference Finals.
Contractual issues kept Gáborík from starting the 2003–04 season with the Wild, as his initial entry-level contract came to an end in the off-season. Holding out with Dukla Trenčín, his agent, Allan Walsh, asserted that Gáborík would not take less than $6.5 million a year. After switching agents three times, Gáborík eventually agreed to a three-year, $10 million contract with the Wild on 31 October 2003. Limited to 65 games that season, he recorded 18 goals and 40 points. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Gáborík again returned to Dukla Trenčín, where he dominated with 52 points in 29 games. He also saw time with Färjestad BK of the Swedish Elitserien.

As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Gáborík took another step forward, becoming a point-per-game player with 38 goals and 66 points in a 65-game season limited by a groin injury. His season was shortened once more the following season in 2006–07, re-injuring his groin on 20 October 2006, against the Anaheim Ducks. Despite a 10- to 14-day estimated recovery time, he did not return to the lineup until 6 January 2007, against the Colorado Avalanche months later. Although Gáborík missed 34 games, he still managed a second consecutive 30-goal season to go with 57 points overall.

On 20 December 2007, Gáborík recorded a six-point game against the New York Rangers with five goals and an assist. This made him the first player in Wild history to score five goals in a game, as well as the first NHLer since Sergei Fedorov of the Detroit Red Wings did so, 11 years earlier (on 26 December 1996, against the Washington Capitals). At mid-season, he was chosen to his second NHL All-Star Game and would go on to record personal bests of 42 goals, 41 assists and 83 points. Gáborík finished his career year as team captain for the Wild in March 2008. It was the first time in his career he was chosen as part of the team&#x27;s monthly rotating captaincy.
Entering the final year of his contract with the Wild in 2008–09, the Wild began negotiations early to re-sign Gáborík. A ten-year, $80 million deal was turned down by Gáborík, and the Wild consequently began entertaining trade offers from NHL teams. His playing time with the Wild was limited in his final year after being sidelined early in the season with a lower-body injury before undergoing hip surgery in January 2009. He returned to the lineup on 21 March 2009, against the Edmonton Oilers and finished the season with 23 points in 17 games.

Gáborík was unable to sign a new contract with the Wild in the 2009 off-season. He left the Wild after eight seasons as its last original player and as the club&#x27;s all-time leader in goals, assists and points, all of which have since been surpassed by Mikko Koivu.

===New York Rangers (2009–2013)===
Leading up to the free agency period, Gáborík was speculated to have interest in signing with the Vancouver Canucks after &quot;The Province&quot; reported he had recently bought a home in West Vancouver in the 2009 off-season. Nevertheless, Gáborík signed as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers on the first day of free agency on 1 July 2009. The Rangers signed him to a reported $37.5 million contract over five years.
Gáborík got off to a quick start with his new club, scoring 10 goals in his first 12 games. Nearly a month into the season, he suffered a knee injury after colliding with former Ranger Petr Průcha in a game against the Phoenix Coyotes on 26 October 2009. He missed two games, including what would have been his first game back in Minnesota against the Wild. Gáborík was injured for a second time in the season when his right leg was cut by team goaltender Henrik Lundqvist during a team practice on 9 February 2010. Though the Rangers missed the 2010 playoffs, Gáborík did not disappoint in his first season with the team; he played in 76 games, matching his career high with 42 goals, and set a new career high in points with 86.

Gáborík&#x27;s second season with the Rangers, in 2010–11, was hampered by injury. Just three games into the season, he suffered a shoulder injury after receiving an illegal boarding hit in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The injury caused him to miss nearly a month, and, upon his return, limited his playing style, which relies on his tremendous wrist shot. Perhaps due to lingering effects from his various ailments, Gáborík proved a streaky scorer throughout the season and finished with 22 goals and 26 assists in 62 games, though 12 of those goals came in four games. His best game of the season was on 19 January 2011, when Gáborík scored four goals and an assist in a 7–0 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs. For the first time since Gáborík had joined the team, the Rangers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with a 5–2 win over the rival New Jersey Devils in the final game of the season. Gáborík contributed an assist on the game-winning goal, and a plus-minus rating of +2 during the game.

On 29 January 2012, Gáborík was named the MVP of the 59th NHL All-Star Game in Ottawa.

On 3 May 2012, shortly after midnight, Gáborík scored a triple-overtime game winner against the Washington Capitals in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, giving the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series, whilst ending one of the longest playoff games in Rangers history.
On the commencement of the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Gáborík, who remained idle during the labour dispute, struggled to recapture his previous scoring pace with New York, often overshadowed by the addition of Rick Nash to the Rangers.

===Columbus Blue Jackets (2013–2014)===
After scoring nine goals in 35 games, Gáborík was dealt at the trade deadline on 3 April 2013, along with minor league players Blake Parlett and Steven Delisle, to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Derick Brassard, Derek Dorsett, John Moore and a sixth-round draft pick. The following night, Gáborík made his debut with the Blue Jackets and immediately made an impact, scoring the game-winning goal and earning an assist in a victory over the Nashville Predators. Gáborík then scored for Columbus in their opening game of the 2013–14 season, a 4–3 loss to the Calgary Flames. However, he shortly thereafter suffered an injury and missed 17 games to recover from a sprained left knee. In his first game back on December 21, 2013, he immediately broke his collarbone in the first period of a game against the Philadelphia Flyers.

===Los Angeles Kings and Ottawa Senators (2014–2018)===
Gáborík was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on 5 March 2014, in exchange for forward Matt Frattin, a second-round draft pick and a conditional third-round pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. The Kings&#x27; acquisition of Gáborík paid dividends in the 2014 playoffs, as he went on to lead the playoffs with 14 goals and contributed to the Kings&#x27; effort in capturing their second Stanley Cup in three years, prevailing over his former club, the New York Rangers.
On 25 June 2014, Gáborík, as a pending free agent, opted to remain with the Kings in signing a seven-year, $34.125 million contract. In the 2014–15 season, Gaborik would put up 27 goals for 47 points point in 69 games with the Kings, including scoring the game winning goal at the 2015 NHL Stadium Series. Over the next three seasons, his goal scoring would drop and injuries would take their toll on him.

On 15 December 2017, Gáborík played his 1,000th career NHL game. Gáborík recorded two points in a 4–2 win to the Rangers.

However, two months later, on 13 February 2018, Gáborík and Nick Shore were traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Dion Phaneuf and Nate Thompson. Gáborík underwent surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on 5 April 2018. The 2017–18 season would prove to be his last, as he did not play the following three seasons after being placed on the injured reserve list.

On 27 December 2020, Gáborík&#x27;s rights were traded along with goaltender Anders Nilsson from Ottawa to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for defenseman Braydon Coburn, forward Cédric Paquette, and a 2022 second-round draft pick. This was viewed as a move to allow Tampa Bay to be salary cap compliant for the 2020–21 NHL season. On 4 November 2021, Gáborík officially announced his retirement from the NHL.

==Charity==
Gáborík has used his success to benefit Slovak ice hockey and player development. In 2005, he opened his ice rink Arena Mariána Gáboríka in his native city of Trenčín at a personal cost of approximately 50 million Slovak koruna. The ice rink provides the opportunity to both learn how to skate as well as play ice hockey for local youth, and also contains both a full fitness center for off-ice conditioning and accommodations so that participants in programs may stay overnight. The rink earned the distinction of 2005 Construction of the Year in Trenčín. Beginning in 2009, Gáborík&#x27;s ice rink has also begun offering a hockey school program.

Of the rink, Gáborík says:

Gáborík spends a lot of personal time pursuing this endeavor during the off-season, as he personally attends each of his hockey school&#x27;s summer camp sessions to meet the campers and pose for photographs.

Gáborík has also founded the Marian Gaborik Foundation, which also supports his mission of expanding access to youth hockey in Slovakia.

<text>A pastry chef or pâtissier (; feminine pâtissière, ) is a station chef in a professional kitchen, skilled in the making of pastries, desserts, breads and other baked goods. They are employed in large hotels, bistros, restaurants, bakeries, by caterers, and some cafés.

==Duties and functions==

The pastry chef is a member of the classic &quot;brigade de cuisine&quot; in a professional kitchen and is the station chef of the pastry department.

Day-to-day operations can also require the pastry chef to research recipe concepts and develop and test new recipes. Usually, the pastry chef does all the necessary preparation of the various desserts in advance, before dinner seating begins. The actual plating of the desserts is often done by another station chef, usually the &quot;garde manger&quot;, at the time of order. The pastry chef is often in charge of the dessert menu, which, besides traditional desserts, could include dessert wines, specialty dessert beverages, and gourmet cheese platters. 

They are responsible for the creation and execution of dessert courses, as well as the menu&#x27;s overall presentation. Pastry chefs must have a solid grasp of flavor profiles, baking processes, and food styling in order to create desserts that are both delicious and aesthetically pleasing. In addition to their technical abilities, pastry chefs must be able to work swiftly and effectively under pressure, as they are sometimes required to meet strict deadlines.

Pastry chefs are also expected to fully understand their ingredients and the chemical reactions that occur when making fine pastries. Precise timing and temperatures are critically important. It is generally preferred to weigh the ingredients (i.e., with a kitchen scale) as opposed to measuring by volume (e.g., with a measuring cup), as weighing inherently offers far more consistent baking results.

In larger kitchens, the pastry chef may have a number of other chefs working in their station, each responsible for specific types of pastries:

* (baker): responsible for breads, cakes, and breakfast pastries
* (confectioner): responsible for candies and &quot;petits fours&quot;
* (decorator): responsible for specialty cakes and show pieces
* : responsible for cold and frozen desserts

Job requirements 
* Proven experience as a pastry chef, baker, or relevant role
* Great attention to detail and creativity
* Organization and leadership skills
* Willingness to replenish professional knowledge
* Thorough knowledge of sanitation principles, food preparation and cooking techniques, and nutrition
* Working knowledge of baking with ingredient limits (gluten-free, sugar-free pastries, etc.)
* Certificate in Culinary Arts, Baking, Patisserie or relevant field

<text>St Albans is a small and historic village on the Macdonald River, New South Wales, Australia, about 94 kilometres (65 mi) north west of Sydney. At the , St Albans and the surrounding area had a population of 305 people.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the Hawkesbury district were the Darug tribe of Aboriginals, also spelt as Dharug or Daruk. The river, which they called Derrubbin, was a focal point as a source of food and transport. The Darug people used the river to farm for fish, eels, water birds, and mussels. They also used the river as a mode of transport in bark canoes.

It was first settled by Europeans in 1794 in a bid to acquire arable land to feed the increasing population of the penal colony at Sydney. In April 1794, Lieutenant Governor Francis Grose submitted plans for the first 22 farms on the Hawkesbury River in the present Pitt Town Bottoms area. In June 1795 a camp of Aboriginal peoples opposing the landtakings was harassed by a British regiment commanded by Paterson (who later regretted the necessary injustice).

The &quot;Village of Macdonald&quot; was surveyed in 1837 but renamed St Albans on 26 January 1841 after the City of St Albans in Hertfordshire, England, north of London.

In the early part of the colonial settlement of New South Wales, the Macdonald Valley was an important agricultural area because of its accessibility by water. However, with the development of railways and extensive agricultural development west of the Great Dividing Range, the Macdonald Valley less important and declined into a remote backwater. The valley is often referred to by the locals as the &quot;Forgotten Valley&quot;.

St Albans is on the banks of the Macdonald River, a tributary of the Hawkesbury River which is about 15 kilometres (9.5 mi) to the south. The village was opened for settlement in 1842 largely because it had become an important stopping point for farmers and others in the area wanting to ship their goods down the Hawkesbury River to Sydney. St Albans was at the navigational upper limit of the Macdonald River. This upper portion of the river has since been drastically reduced to navigation with sand and silt.

==Ferry and road access==
Two (free) 24-hour car ferries provide access to St Albans from the Sydney region along roads following the old goat and horse tracks on either side of the Macdonald. Both roads meander (one partly unsealed) through rich country and farms of cattle, melons, orchards and corn. On either side of the river are historic homes and spectacular sandstone towering hills. A route is through Wisemans Ferry township and north across the Hawkesbury via Wisemans ferry, then follows the eastern side of the Macdonald. The first bridge to cross the river links the two roads at St Albans. Another route to St Albans is to turn left just before entering Wisemans Ferry township, cross the Hawkesbury via the Webbs Creek Ferry, then follow up the western side of the Macdonald to the village.

==Churches and cemetery==

The St Albans Anglican Church (Saint Alban The Martyr), near the top of Wharf Road is the only church still in use. A timber chapel, opened in 1843, was replaced by the current stone building in 1897.

Another interesting stone church remaining in the village is the old Wesleyan Methodist church in Espie Street. This was built in 1902 and is now in private hands, a reminder of almost 150 years of Wesleyan influence in the Macdonald valley.

The funerals of those close to town usually progressed by boat to the old St Albans Burial Ground, a few kilometres south of the village beside the river, founded in 1826. This site had in the past suffered much by neglect, floods and vandalism but is now preserved.

==Historic buildings==

Two sites in St Albans are listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register:

* 181 Main Road: MacDonald River bridge
* 37 Upper Macdonald Road: Price Morris Cottage

Other historic sites include:

* The Court House and Police lockup built in 1890 
The Court House is perched on wooded slopes of Hawkesbury sandstone, high above the beautiful Macdonald River and St Albans. The building, originally consisting of a courtroom, police station and lock-up, now offers comfortable overnight and holiday accommodation. The original prisoners&#x27; exercise yard is now a recreational area. The two original cells have been retained as unique bathrooms. The building is recognised by the National Trust and has a City of Hawkesbury heritage classification.
* The Settlers Arms Inn (Originally known as Travellers Rest)
The inn occupies a picturesque position facing the river and is in an excellent state of preservation. In July 1842 the first land sales were held in St Albans. John Sullivan of Wollombi purchased seven allotments on which he built the Settlers Arms Inn. It was constructed at a cattle drover&#x27;s camp on the limit of navigation on the Macdonald River. It still trades as &quot;a purveyor of conversation, beer, and accommodation&quot;. There is some confusion as to the construction date. 1836 was the year the license was issued, number. 36/10, but a report by the Hawkesbury correspondent in the ‘’Sydney Morning Herald’’ on 1 March 1848 reads: &quot;The township which a few years ago was marked out upon this river, has been built on by only one individual, Mr. Sullivan. He has erected a very reasonable stone house two stories high, which we understand he intends to open as an Inn.&quot; [Implying that it was not open then.].
* Price Morris Cottage 1837 
The newly restored 1837 cottage took 8 years to build and 2 years to restore. It has vertical timber slab, wattle and daub construction with its calico ceilings under a shingle roof. Price Morris, an emancipist/farmer took up the 50 acre (20 hectare) property grant in 1837. In the 1830s the area was settled by Welsh Methodists and the Price Morris cottage became the centre for Methodist meetings and worship. A Methodist church was built in St. Albans but the cottage continued as an occasional meeting place until the late 1960s. One of the preachers was the grandfather of the late Sir Alan Walker, founder of the Central Methodist Mission.

==Floods==

There were devastating floods in 1867, 1889, 1913, and particularly 1949. The town lies fifty feet above the riverbed and the floor of the bridge is forty feet from the sand. In the 1889 flood the bridge was covered, the Court House was not washed away but the Police quarters were. The water rose to the eaves of Jurds Hotel (Settlers Arms Inn) and left a hole seven feet deep in front of it. The old house was of stone, but some of it washed away. The floodwaters rose to the veranda eaves and washed away five houses, and another newly built on the other side of the river.

<doc id="718823" wikidata="Q220756" url="?curid=718823" title="A Day at the Races (album)">
<text>A Day at the Races is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 10 December 1976 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Recorded at The Manor, Sarm East, and Wessex Sound Studios in England, it was the band&#x27;s first completely self-produced album, and the first completed without the involvement of producer Roy Thomas Baker; engineering duties were handled by Mike Stone. It serves as a companion to Queen&#x27;s previous album, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, with both taking their names from Marx Brothers films and having similar packaging and eclectic musical themes.

The album reached the top of the charts in the UK, Japan, and the Netherlands. It reached number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and was Queen&#x27;s third album to ship gold in the US, subsequently reaching platinum status in the country. In 2006, a listener poll conducted by BBC Radio 2 saw &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; voted the 67th greatest album of all time.
== Background ==
On 25 April 1976, the band settled back in London after a four-leg, six-month, and exhaustive tour of their highly successful album &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot;, recorded during the oppressive summer of 1975. The band had decided to take a two-month hiatus. They only occasionally did business-related activities (like filming the promotional video for &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; in late April). During June, the band was beginning to plan out the recording sessions for the album, visiting recording studios around Greater London to determine where they would produce the album. On 15 June, Roger Taylor and John Deacon visited Sweet Silence Studios in Denmark. The studio was completed only two months prior.

After Taylor and Deacon returned from Denmark, rehearsals began on 17 June at Ridge Farm Studio, where the band had rehearsed for their previous album in July 1975. Due to equipment issues during the first week, the band hired Pete Cornish on 25 June to assist in equipment maintenance. Cornish and the band had previous involvement, as his company had helped repair and construct new equipment for the band in January 1972.

== Recording and production ==
Queen entered The Manor in Oxfordshire on 12 July to commence work on &quot;A Day At The Races.&quot; Absent was Roy Thomas Baker, who had helped the band produce their last four albums. The four-album contract he had signed with the band in 1972 had expired after the release of the band&#x27;s fourth album, and the band had decided to record the album by themselves, with the assistance of engineers Mike Stone and Gary Langan.

On 21 July, Crystal Taylor, one of the band&#x27;s roadies, who later became Roger&#x27;s personal assistant, arrived at The Manor to provide assistance with equipment and observe the session. He originally planned to stay a week, but on 28 July, the band asked him to stay another week. Around this date, work began to relax as the band had finished 6 songs. Those songs were &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot;, &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;, &quot;White Man&quot; (then titled &quot;Simple Man&quot;), &quot;Drowse&quot;, and a shorter version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. As August entered, the band worked on the remaining songs of the album, and finished a longer version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;. Work was still relaxed though, and the band sometimes played billiards or card games during productive days. During a game of billiards on 8 August, between Roger and Crystal Taylor, Roger asked Crystal to be his personal roadie, to which Crystal assented.

The band had booked to play two concerts on 20 and 21 August at the Playhouse Theatre in Edinburgh, and the band said to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; they would be debuting new material during those concerts. The band eventually cancelled those concerts since the songs they wanted to debut weren&#x27;t finished, and instead did a mini-tour of the country during September. The band had at least the backing tracks of &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (likely the overdubbed product), &quot;Long Away&quot;, &quot;You And I,&quot; and &quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)&quot; recorded by 24 August, including the previously recorded material, before the band began to rehearse for their summer mini-tour the following day.

The summer tour started in Edinburgh, where &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, and &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot; were debuted to the audience. During the summer tour, the band moved production into Sarm East Studios and worked there sporadically in between concerts (in approximately nine sessions) between 5 and 16 September to do overdubs. During this period predominantly guitar overdubs were added to &quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot;. Most of the songs that were initially recorded in July were finished off during this time, and the rest of the songs recorded in August that weren&#x27;t performed live were put off until work on the album properly resumed.

Recording sessions resumed on 20 September at Sarm, with more overdubs and rough mixing of some of the finished tracks. On 23 September, the band published a thank you message in the music press to their fans regarding their warm response to their concert at Hyde Park on 18 September (the final date of the summer tour). &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; was mostly mixed on 26 September, and a mix of &quot;Long Away&quot; was worked on during the same day. The band completed a preliminary mix of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; on 29 September.

The band turned their attention to the lead single during mid-October, which was scheduled to be released in three weeks. They mixed the single from 18 to 24 October. &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, which was recorded in two separate parts, was mixed first. Parts 1 and 2 were fused together and completed on 22 October. They then turned their attention to &quot;White Man&quot;, which was mostly mixed on 23 October and finished on 24 October. The band then moved to Wessex Sound Studios on 25 October to begin mixing the rest of the album. On 26 October, &quot;Long Away&quot; and &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; were mixed. On 28 October, while mixing tracks off of the album, the band were taken into a different room at Wessex to partake in a photoshoot. The photos from this shoot ended up on the inner sleeve of the album.

Pressure to complete the album was becoming more apparent, as the due date was coming close. After a day off at the end of the month, work immediately resumed. On 1 November, &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot; was mixed, and finished off the following day. A tape of the still unfinished album was created on 5 November, with a different track-list and a lot of chatter and studio noise clearly not mixed out of some songs yet. &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot; wasn&#x27;t even completed at this point, with some crucial overdubs still to be done. On 9 November, &quot;Long Away&quot;, &quot;Drowse&quot;, and &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; were fully mixed at Wessex. These songs had been worked on during the previous three days.

On 16 November, &quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot; and &quot;You And I&quot; were mixed at Wessex. On 17 and 18 November, &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot; was mixed at Wessex, and the album was mastered on 19 November, officially completing it. A pressing of the album was played to fans and music press at Advision Studios on 26 November. The album took approximately 16 weeks in total to record, the longest time the band had spent recording an album yet.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;====

&quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; was written by Brian May in Tenerife in early 1968, two years before the formation of Queen. At the time, he was working on his PhD in Astronomy. He wrote the song on Spanish guitar and thought he&#x27;d change the title and chorus later on, but when he brought it to the band for inclusion on this album, Freddie Mercury liked the original and it was kept the way it was written.

The song is preceded by an instrumental introduction consisting of a multi-tracked guitar part, reminiscent of the song &quot;White Man&quot;, followed by a Shepard tone figure, which is reprised at the end of &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot; to create a &quot;circle&quot; in the album. The ascending scale of the second part of the intro was created by reversing a recording of a descending scale played on a harmonium.

The main bulk of the song can be described as heavy blues rock, featuring aggressive vocals by lead singer Mercury, as well as a slide guitar solo by May, who provided most of the backing vocals.

A music video was made for the song, directed by Bruce Gowers and based on a performance clip shot at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, in February 1977 during the band&#x27;s US arena headlining tour. After its release in 1976, the song was played by Queen on every subsequent tour.

====&quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;====
&quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot; was written by Mercury and based on the harmonic minor scale. He performed it by himself at Hyde Park before recording it, and all of the vocals in the version of the song on the album were performed by him, as was the piano part.

Unusual for Queen, Mercury&#x27;s lead vocals were triple-tracked to achieve &quot;a solo vocal that could hold its own against the chorus.&quot;

There is a vocal interlude between this song and the next in which a wash of vocals consisting of a loop of a multi-tracked Mercury repeating the words &quot;take my breath&quot; steadily increases in volume until it resolves into the echoed phrase &quot;take my breath away&quot; and fades out.

====&quot;Long Away&quot;====

&quot;Long Away&quot; was composed and sung by May. He used a Burns Double Six 12-string electric guitar for the rhythm parts, instead of his Red Special; he had wanted to use a Rickenbacker because he admired John Lennon, but did not get along well with the thin neck of the instrument. The song was released as a single in the US, Canada, and New Zealand, but failed to chart anywhere.

====&quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot;====
&quot;The Millionaire Waltz&quot; was written by Mercury about John Reid (Queen and Elton John&#x27;s manager at the time). Like &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, it is a multi-key and multi-metre song and features abrupt arrangement changes and May doing multi-tracked guitar choirs. Partway through, this waltz is interrupted by a short hard rock segment. It is a noteworthy example of John Deacon&#x27;s &quot;lead bass&quot; playing, which can be heard quite prominently early in the song, when only Deacon and Mercury are playing (bass guitar and piano/vocals, respectively).

====&quot;You and I&quot;====
&quot;You and I&quot; is the only song on the album written by Deacon. It is in the key of D major, is mainly piano-driven, and features Deacon on acoustic guitar. The song was featured as the B-side for &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, but was never played live.

===Side two===
====&quot;Somebody to Love&quot;====

&quot;Somebody to Love&quot; was written by Mercury. The song was inspired by gospel music, especially that of Aretha Franklin, and Mercury, May and Taylor all multi-tracked their voices to achieve the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir. Mercury&#x27;s vocal part features a wide range of notes, going from an A2 (in the last choral verse) to a falsetto A5 (at the peak of his melisma on &quot;ooh&quot; over the choir break). Staying true to Queen&#x27;s guitar-driven style, the track was also filled with intricate harmony parts and a solo by May.

The song was the biggest hit single from the album. It went to number two on the UK charts (kept from the number one spot by &quot;Under the Moon of Love&quot; by Showaddywaddy) and number 13 on the US singles chart.

====&quot;White Man&quot;====
&quot;White Man&quot; was written by May about the suffering of Native Americans at the hands of European immigrants during the colonial period, taking the viewpoint of native peoples. It is one of Queen&#x27;s heaviest works, thematically and musically.

====&quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot;====

&quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; was written by Mercury. It starts with a piano and vocal introduction by Mercury, and the bass and drums join in at the start of the chorus. Part of the bridge of the song is sung by Mike Stone (the lines: &quot;Hey boy where&#x27;d you get it from? Hey boy where did you go?&quot;). The recording is enhanced by multi-tracked vocals, as well as May&#x27;s guitar choirs.

The song was performed live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in June 1977, with Taylor singing Stone&#x27;s part. Most of the track was a concert staple on the band&#x27;s &quot;A Day at the Races Tour&quot; and &quot;News of the World Tour&quot;.

====&quot;Drowse&quot;====
&quot;Drowse&quot; is the only song on the album written by Roger Taylor, who, in addition to playing the drums, did all of the vocals and played rhythm guitar; May played the slide guitar. Like &quot;I&#x27;m In Love With My Car&quot;, Taylor&#x27;s song on the previous album, &quot;Drowse&quot; is in .

The song has never been performed live, but it was rehearsed by Queen + Adam Lambert before their Rock Big Ben Live concert. It made an appearance on both the standard and deluxe editions of &quot;Queen Forever&quot;.

====&quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)&quot;====

&quot;Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)&quot; was May&#x27;s tribute to the band&#x27;s Japanese fans, and was performed live in Tokyo during the Jazz Tour in 1979, and again when the band visited Japan during The Game and Hot Space tours in 1981 and 1982, respectively. It has two choruses sung in Japanese, making it one of only three Queen songs in which an entire verse or chorus is sung in a language other than English (the others being &quot;Mustapha&quot;, from &quot;Jazz&quot; and &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot; from &quot;Hot Space&quot;). The song features a piano, a plastic piano, and a harmonium, all of which are played by May.

The harmonium melody that ends the song is a longer reprise of the second part of the introduction to &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, the first track on the album. May described it as &quot;a never-ending staircase&quot;, otherwise commonly known, especially in music, as a Shepard tone.

==Singles==
In the UK, the first track from the album to be released as a single was &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, on 12 November 1976 (EMI 2565); it reached number two. &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; followed on 4 March 1977 (EMI 2593), reaching number 31, and &quot;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&quot; on 20 May 1977, reaching number 17.

In the US, &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; was released on 10 December 1976 (Elektra E45362) and reached number 13. It was followed by &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; (Elektra E45385) in March 1977, which reached number 49. Both of these were released in Japan, as was &quot;Teo Torriatte&quot;, which was not released as a single in any other territory.

==Reception and legacy==
The album garnered mixed reviews from contemporary critics. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;a judicious blend of heavy metal rockers and classically influenced, almost operatic, torch songs.&quot; The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; was also appreciative, writing: &quot;&quot;Races&quot; is a reconfirmation of Queen&#x27;s position as the best of the third wave of English rock groups.&quot; &quot;Circus&quot; gave the album a mixed review, writing: &quot;With &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, they&#x27;ve deserted art-rock entirely. They&#x27;re silly now. And wondrously shameless.&quot;

However, retrospective reviews have been positive and more appreciative of the album. Greg Kot, reviewing for &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the album a very positive rating that matched the exact rating of the previous album, and commented how he considers this album as a part of the band&#x27;s artistic peak alongside &quot;A Night At The Opera.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot;, along with ballad &quot;You Take My Breath Away&quot;, as the best tracks on the album, and said the album marked a point where Queen &quot;entered a new phase, where they&#x27;re globe-conquering titans instead of underdogs on the make&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;the breadth of its ambition remains ever impressive, as do tracks such as May&#x27;s stomping &#x27;Tie Your Mother Down&#x27; and Mercury&#x27;s baroque one-two, &#x27;Somebody to Love&#x27; and &#x27;Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy&#x27;.&quot; Ben Sisario, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), found the album &quot;a little too predictable&quot; and called it &quot;a quickie sequel to &quot;Opera&quot;.&quot; Similarly, AJ Ramirez, writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, described the album as &quot;a comparative comedown&quot; and &quot;a good but not stupendous record&quot;, while acknowledging the band were &quot;now firmly in command of the mechanics of pop songcraft&quot;, which had yielded them more singles than any previous album.

In 2006, a listener poll conducted by BBC Radio 2 saw &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; voted the 67th greatest album of all time. The same year, in a worldwide &quot;Guinness&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; poll to find the &quot;Greatest 100 Albums of All Time&quot;, the album was voted number 87. It was also featured in &quot;Classic Rock&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The 200 Greatest Albums of the 70s&quot;, being listed as one of the 20 greatest albums of 1976. &quot;Out&quot; ranked it No. 20 of 100 in a poll of &quot;more than 100 actors, comedians, musicians, writers, critics, performance artists, label reps, and DJs, asking each to list the 10 albums that left the most indelible impressions on their lives.&quot; In the 1987 edition of &quot;The World Critics List&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s Peter Powell ranked &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; the 6th greatest album of all time, and Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; included the record in his &quot;The Great Albums&quot; in 2006.

==Reissues==
The album was reissued as part of the Hollywood Records remasters in 1991. It was also reissued by Parlophone in various European countries in 1993, remastered and sometimes with an altered track listing and timings (due to the placement of the beginning of &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; in its own track, titled &quot;Intro&quot;). In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab issued a remaster of the album in the United States on both CD (numbered UDCD 668) and vinyl (numbered MFSL-1-256).

On 8 November 2010, record company Universal Music announced a remastered and expanded reissue of the album set for release in May 2011. This was part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which marked the end of Queen&#x27;s almost 40-year association with EMI Records. All of the band&#x27;s albums were remastered and reissued by Universal in 2011.

<doc id="718831" wikidata="Q224033" url="?curid=718831" title="Karel Poborský">
<text>Karel Poborský (; born 30 March 1972) is a Czech former professional association football player. Poborský played as a winger, and was most noted for his technical ability and pace.

Poborský began and finished his club career at Dynamo České Budějovice, where his kit number 8 is retired in his honour. He also won the Czech First League titles at Slavia and Sparta, the two largest clubs in Prague. Between these domestic triumphs, he won a Premier League title at Manchester United, and also played for Benfica and Lazio.

After Petr Čech, Poborský ranks second in appearances for the Czech national team, having appeared 118 times between 1994 and 2006. Poborský retired from international football after playing at the country&#x27;s first World Cup. He also played in three European Championships and was named in the Team of the Tournament at UEFA Euro 1996 after helping the Czechs to the final.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Karel Poborský made his top-flight debut for Dynamo České Budějovice in the 1991–92 Czechoslovak First League. He transferred to the Prague-based club Viktoria Žižkov in mid 1994, before moving to local rivals Slavia Prague in mid 1995.

In the 1995–96 season, Poborský led Slavia Prague to the Czech First League title and to the semi-finals of the 1995–96 UEFA Cup.

===Manchester United===
Poborský was one several players from the Czech national squad at UEFA Euro 1996 who after the tournament left the Czech Republic to play elsewhere. Poborský received offers from Liverpool and Lazio, but in June 1996, he signed for Manchester United for a fee of £3.5 million. He made his club debut in the 1996 FA Charity Shield against Newcastle United, appearing as a substitute for Nicky Butt in a 4–0 win. Poborský also won a Premier League title-winner&#x27;s medal in the 1996–97 season, in which he played in 22 out of 38 league games and scored three goals, and helped United reach the Champions League semi-finals. Due to David Beckham&#x27;s rising stardom, Poborský remained at Manchester United for one and a half seasons; in December 1997 Poborský left that club, having made only six starts that season. His last match for United was a substitute appearance against Everton on 26 December.

===Benfica and Lazio===
in December 1997, Poborský moved to the Portuguese side Benfica for an undisclosed fee, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract to play for the club, which was managed by Graeme Souness. Poborský played for Benfica for three years, leaving shortly after manager Toni Oliveira became the manager in December 2000.

In February 2001, Poborský joined Italian side SS Lazio on an 18-month contract for a transfer fee of £700,000. He scored his first goal for Lazio in a 5–3 win against Verona on 25 February 2001. On the final day of the 2001–02 Serie A season, Poborský scored twice as Lazio beat title contenders Inter Milan 4–2, causing the title to go to Juventus. He left Lazio following the expiry of his contract at the end of the season.

===Return to Czech Republic===
In July 2002, Poborský returned to the Czech Republic after signing as a free agent with Sparta Prague, where he became the highest-paid footballer playing in the country. During his time at Sparta, the club won the league championships in the 2002–03 and 2004–05 seasons, as well as the national cup in 2003–04.

In 2005, he returned to his first club, Dynamo České Budějovice, scoring two goals and setting up a third on the way to a 4–0 victory against Sigma Olomouc B in his first match. He retired on 28 May 2007 after playing his final match, a 2–1 home loss against Slavia Prague, another of his former sides. Dynamo České Budějovice, by which time had Poborský as a co-owner, retired his number-8 shirt.

==International career==
Karel Poborský&#x27;s first international appearance, which was against Turkey on 23 February 1994, was also the first match for the Czech Republic&#x27;s national side after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

===Euro 96===
Poborský played for his country at Euro 96, where he was one of the most valuable players of the tournament. After losing against Germany in the opening group match, a Poborský cross resulted in a goal for teammate Pavel Nedvěd in a 2–1 win against Italy. In the knockout stages of the tournament, Poborský scored his first international goal; he lobbed the ball over Portugal&#x27;s advancing goalkeeper Vítor Baía, settling the game, which the Czech Republic won 1–0. The goal became a trademark shot for Poborský and that shooting style was soon attributed to him. In 2008, Poborský&#x27;s 1996 lob was voted the best individual goal in the &quot;Carlsberg goal of the day&quot; poll on UEFA&#x27;s official website.

In Czechia&#x27;s semi-final against France, Poborský was among players who scored penalties in the shootout after a goaless match, which the Czech Republic won. In the final, the German defender Matthias Sammer fouled Poborský, and Patrik Berger converted the resulting penalty. Germany won the match 2–1 with a golden goal, settling the game, and the Czech Republic finished the tournament as runners-up. Poborský was given the Man of the Match award.

===Euro 2000===
Poborský was part of the Czech squad at Euro 2000. He scored his country&#x27;s first goal of the tournament from the penalty spot, against France in a 2–1 group-stage loss that resulted in Czechia&#x27;s elimination from the championship. In the nation&#x27;s final match of the group stage, against Denmark, Poborský provided the pass from which Vladimír Šmicer opened the scoring, with the game finishing 2–0.

===Euro 2004===
Poborský played at Euro 2004, where he provided four assists, the tournament&#x27;s highest. In his team&#x27;s opening match against Latvia, Poborský kicked the ball over the crossbar in the first half before Latvia unexpectedly scored the first goal. In the second half, he made numerous crosses to teammate Milan Baroš, who in the 72nd minute converted one to equalise the match at 1–1. The match finished 2–1 after Marek Heinz scored a late winner for the Czech Republic. In Czechia&#x27;s second group-stage match against the Netherlands, the Dutch side took a 2–0 lead but Poborský assisted the game-winning third Czech goal, which Vladimír Šmicer scored. The Czech Republic had already having qualified for the knockout stages of the tournament. Poborský and eight other players were rested for the final group-stage match against Germany, in which he played from the 70th minute as a substitute for Jaroslav Plašil. Czechia won the match 2–1, eliminating Germany from the competition.

At the quarter-final stage, Poborský provided two more assists as the Czech side defeated Denmark 3–0, with all of the goals coming in the second half. In the 49th minute, Jan Koller converted his corner, scoring the first goal. In the 63rd minute, a Poborský through ball found Milan Baroš, who doubled their team&#x27;s advantage. Baroš later scored his second goal of the match. In the semi-finals, Czechia played against Greece; the game was Poborský&#x27;s 99th for his national team. Although Poborský created two chances, the Czech Republic failed to score and lost the match after defender Traianos Dellas scored a silver goal for Greece in extra time.

=== Other international matches===
Poborský was included in the Czech national squad for the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 World Cup. Following the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football, having scored eight goals and made 118 appearances for his national team, a record at the time.

==Football administration==
After concluding his playing career, Poborský became technical director of the Czech national team. He held the role for almost two years, resigning in April 2009. In 2011, Poborský became chairman of the newly founded , a member of FIFPRO. He resigned from the role in June 2013, saying the workload of his role as chairman of the board of Dynamo České Budějovice was the reason for his decision.

==Personal life==
Karel Poborský was previously married with two children. After the breakdown of his marriage, he had another daughter. In 2013 Poborský moved from Hluboká nad Vltavou to Prague. In 2016, Poborský was put into a medically induced coma after contracting a brain infection that paralysed the muscles in his face and caused hypersensitivity to light. Poborský spent three weeks in hospital before making a full recovery, and said if he had arrived at the hospital a day later, he might have died. Poborský&#x27;s nickname is Steve, after the similarly-named Canadian skier Steve Podborski.

<doc id="718833" wikidata="Q1093445" url="?curid=718833" title="Chute (gravity)">
<text>A chute is a vertical or inclined plane, channel, or passage through which objects are moved by means of gravity.

==Landform==
A chute, also known as a race, flume, cat, or river canyon, is a steep-sided passage through which water flows rapidly.

Akin to these, man-made chutes, such as the timber slide and log flume, were used in the logging industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of spillways on some dams. Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes. These include aqueducts, puquios, and acequias.

==Building chutes==
Chutes are in common use in tall buildings to allow fast and efficient transport of items and materials from the upper floors to a central location on one of the lower floors, especially the basement. Chutes may be round, square or rectangular at the top and/or the bottom.

* Laundry chutes in hotels are placed on each floor to allow the expedient transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel&#x27;s laundry facility without having to use elevators or stairs. These chutes are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials.

Home laundry chutes are typically found in homes with basement laundry to allow the collection of all household members&#x27; dirty laundry, conveniently near the bedrooms and laundry facilities, without the constant transport of laundry bins from story-to-story or room-to-room or up and down stairs. Home laundry chutes may be less common than previously due to building codes or concern regarding fireblocking, the prevention of fire from spreading from floor-to-floor, as well as child safety. However, construction including cabinets, doors, lids, and locks may make both risks significantly less than with simple stairwells.

* Refuse chutes or garbage chutes are common in high-rise apartment buildings and are used to collect all the building&#x27;s garbage in one place. Often the bottom end of the chute is placed directly above a large, open waste container, at times this also includes a mechanical waste compactor. This makes garbage collection faster and more efficient, however can be a hygiene risk due to garbage residue left inside the chutes.
* Mail chutes are used in some buildings to collect the occupants&#x27; mail. A notable example is the Asia Insurance Building.
* Escape chutes are used and proposed for use in evacuation of mining equipment and high-rise buildings.
* Construction chutes are used to safely remove rubble and similar demolition materials and waste from taller buildings. These temporary structures typically consist of a chain of cylindrical or conical plastic tubes, each fitted into the top of the one below and tied together, usually with chains. Together they form a long flexible tube, which is hung down the side of the building. The lower end of this tube is placed over a skip or other receptacle, and waste materials are dropped through the top. Heavy duty steel chutes may also be used when the debris being deposited is heavy duty and in cases of particularly taller buildings.

An elevator is not a chute as it does not move by gravity.

== Chutes in transportation ==
Goust, a hamlet in southwestern France, is notable for its mountainside chute that is used to transport coffins.

Chutes are also found in:
* Hopper cars
* Hopper barges

<text>Wynyard Park is a urban park in the Sydney central business district, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Wynyard Park is bounded by York, Carrington, Margaret and Wynyard Streets. Surrounded by modern high-rise buildings it is one of the most densely built-up and intensively used parks in Sydney. Entrances to Wynyard railway station are located on the north-eastern and north-western corners of the park.

Wynyard Park is the site of the first military barracks in Australia, the present park having its location, form and dimensions from the space of the original parade ground that the barracks occupied. The site is one of Australia&#x27;s oldest parks to be continuously set aside as open space for public use in an urban context. The park has maintained its role as an open square for public meetings, political protests, entertainment, assembly and passive recreation since its dedication as a public park in 1887.

Wynyard Park is a popular place for office workers to eat lunch. Also, many bus services to the northern suburbs originate their journeys in the streets bordering the park.

== History ==
The space which is now Wynyard Park was originally the parade ground of the first military barracks established shortly after the European colonisation of Sydney in 1788. It was from the park that the New South Wales Corps marched to arrest Governor Bligh in 1808, an event later known as the Rum Rebellion. Following the 1848 completion of Victoria Barracks, the barracks site was subdivided and private dwellings and shops were developed. Provision was made for a square to remain on the higher part of the former Barrack Square. From 1848-1887 the area was known as Wynyard Square, named after General Wynyard, Commander of British Forces in Australia, from 1848 to 1853. The square was dedicated as a recreation ground in 1875 and fenced and landscaped. Like similar squares in England its use was confined to residents who held keys to the gates, although by 1907 the American trend of removing fences around parks had been copied here.

The original George Street military barracks were much larger in area, extending from Barrack Street in the south to almost Jamieson Street in the north, and extending west to Clarence Street

Also in the 1880s a bus terminus was established for passengers from the southern suburbs, beginning the area’s long association with public transport. The building of a railway station here was first suggested in 1881 but it was 1932 before Wynyard Station opened. The square was dedicated as a public park in 1887 and the following year a bandstand was erected in the centre of the park. The park&#x27;s most significant period was 1890 to 1910 when it was well planned and established. Its layout reflects this late Victorian Period in its landscape design. Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis (1835-1849) and the Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens Charles Moore (1848-1896), influenced the design of the park. From 1887 it became known as Wynyard Park.

When the Sydney underground railways (now part of the Sydney Trains network) were constructed in 1927, Wynyard railway station was constructed by excavating the park and then rebuilding the park after the station had been constructed.

== Description ==
At the northern end of the park is a statue by Giovanni Fontana from 1890 of the Reverend J. D. Lang, the Presbyterian minister and controversialist, lived at Wynyard Square and was responsible for the erection of the Scots Church in 1826. His statue is close to the Church, formerly the main Presbyterian church in central Sydney. 

The ornate underground men’s lavatory with a domed glass roof was built in 1912 and is similar to others at Hyde Park, Taylor Square and Macquarie Place Park.

The park includes mature border plantings of Moreton Bay Figs (&quot;Flindersia Australis&quot;) and Plane trees, an Art Nouveau toilet block including fences, signs and lights, and sandstone walls.

<text>Bruck an der Mur () is a city of some 15,970 people located in the district Bruck-Mürzzuschlag, in the Austrian state of Styria. It is located at the confluence of the rivers Mur and Mürz. Its manufacturing includes metal products and paper. Bruck is located on the Graz to Vienna main line, and is an important regional rail junction.

==History==

The earliest surviving record of Bruck dates from the time of King Ludovicus II &quot;Germanicus&quot;, when it was identified, in a record dated 20 November 860, as &quot;ad pruccam&quot;, a manor of the archbishopric of Salzburg. The settlement then identified with this name was in the location currently occupied by the suburb now called &quot;St. Ruprecht&quot;. The settlement then located at what is now the centre of Bruck is identified in the ninth century record as &quot;muorica kimundi&quot; (i.e. the mouth of the Mürz).

The town was refounded in 1263 by King Otakar II of Bohemia, who was responsible for surrounding Bruck with its city walls. Bruck received its town privileges in 1277 from King Rudolph von Habsburg who in 1273 succeeded Otakar. Bruck an der Mur was an important medieval trade center specializing in iron work.

==Main sights==
The Heiligen-Geist-Kapelle is a 15th-century Gothic chapel, which is of a unique design. The floor plan is an equilateral triangle in honor of the Trinity. This church was completely restored as much as possible to its original appearance, reopening in 2020.

In the centre, there is also the famous Kornmesser house, built in the Venetian style by Pankraz Kornmess in the 15th century. 

The castle of Landskron burned down in the great fire of 1792. After that fire, just two of 166 houses were left standing.

The Grüner See (Green Lake) located in the neighboring municipality of Tragöß-Sankt Katharein is one of the main tourist attractions of the region.

<text>Wahroonga is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, 18 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of Ku-ring-gai Council and Hornsby Shire. North Wahroonga is an adjacent separate suburb of the same postcode.

==History==

Wahroonga is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;our home&quot;, likely originating from the Kuringgai language group. Early British colonists of New South Wales utilized the area for its tall trees. Wahroonga was first colonised by the British in 1822 by Thomas Hyndes, a convict who later became a wealthy landowner.

Hyndes&#x27;s land was later acquired by John Brown, a merchant and timber-getter. After Brown had cleared the land of timber, he planted orchards. Later, Ada, Lucinda and Roland Avenues were named after three of his children. His name is in Browns Road, Browns Field and Browns Waterhole on the Lane Cove River. The last member of the Brown family was Gertrude Mary Appleton, who died in 2008 at the age of ninety-three. She is buried in the cemetery of St John the Baptist Church, Gordon.

After the North Shore railway line was opened in 1890 it became a popular place for wealthy businessmen to build out-of-town residences with large gardens. Wahroonga Post Office opened on 15 October 1896. Much of this development occurred in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Sydney Adventist Hospital was opened in Wahroonga by the Seventh-day Adventist Church on 1 January 1903.

The Great Depression saw Wahroonga face economic crises. The hardship was widespread and many families faced financial difficulties. However, the area&#x27;s wealthy residents were not as affected as those in less affluent areas and Wahroonga maintained its status as a desirable place to live for the upper middle class. There were, however, some struggles within the community, with businesses and local services impacted. It continued to grow, with developments of new roads and suburban expansion. The suburb maintained its suburban charm, with many of the larger estates slowly being subdivided for housing. The 1930s also saw the continued development of the area&#x27;s amenities, making it easier for people to commute to Sydney and helping the suburb maintain its appeal for those looking for a balance of nature and proximity to the city.

Hunt was a Canadian architect who used the Arts and Crafts style and the Shingle Style popular in North America. &quot;Highlands&quot; is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register and was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

Architect William Hardy Wilson designed and built his own home, &quot;Purulia&quot;, on Fox Valley Road. Built in 1913, the home is in the Colonial Revival style and became, according to some observers, a prototype for North Shore homes. It is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

Berith Park, in Billyard Avenue, was designed by F. Ernest Stowe for Alfred Smith, who bought the land in 1897. The house was finished circa 1909.

&quot;Westholme&quot;, in Water Street, was designed by Howard Joseland in the Arts and Crafts style for John Bennett, one of the pioneer developers of Wahroonga. Bennett came from England but migrated to Australia with his wife and acquired property at Wahroonga in 1893. Westholme was built in 1894. Another house was added at the other end of the block, but this was demolished in 1991 after changing hands several times.

&quot;The Gatehouse&quot;, in Water Street, was originally part of the John Williams Hospital. The hospital also includes the Federation mansion &quot;Rippon Grange&quot;, designed by Howard Joseland. &quot;The Gatehouse&quot; is listed on the local government heritage register.

&quot;Craignairn&quot;, at the corner of Burns Road and Cleveland Street, was also designed in the Arts and Crafts style by Howard Joseland. The client was Walter Strang.

Joseland also built his own home &quot;Malvern&quot; two doors away from the Strang home in Burns Road. An example of the Federation Bungalow style, it has been described as &quot;unpretentious and solidly comfortable.&quot; Between &quot;Craignairn&quot; and &quot;Malvern&quot; in Burns Road, Joseland also built &quot;Coolabah&quot;, another fine Federation Bungalow example.

&quot;The Briars&quot;, in Woonona Avenue, is built on land that was granted to John Hughes in 1842, and later divided into four estates. Jessie Edith Balcombe built &quot;The Briars&quot; on one of these estates in 1895. It is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. &#x27;The Briars&#x27; is connected to Napoleon Bonaparte; the house having been built for a grandson of the East India Company Agent who hosted Napoleon at the start of his exile. The house possesses some architectural similarities, and shares its name, with the building on St Helena.

The Rose Seidler House, in Clissold Road, built by Harry Seidler between 1948 and 1950, was one of the first examples of modern residential architecture in Australia.

<text>Czarni Lwów was one of the first Polish professional sports clubs with a well-developed football section as well as ice hockey, among several other sports. The football club was started in the late 19th century in Lwów as a school football section called Sława Lwów. In 1903 the name was changed and the club became professional.

==History==

In 1911, together with KS Cracovia and two other teams, Czarni created the Polish Football Association, the predecessor of the modern PZPN national football association. The first football club in Poland, the Czarni (Black, name coined after their black shirts; because of their colours the team was commonly dubbed &quot;Powidlaki&quot; – an allusion to the &quot;plum marmalade&quot; colour of their logo) were the best known and most popular sports club in Lwów (together with Pogoń Lwów formed soon afterwards). The official name translates as the First Military-Civil Sport Club Blacks Lwów. Although the main interest of the fans lay in football, soon other sections were opened (ice hockey, boxing, skiing, tennis, athletics). Despite their initial successes and their contribution to the history of football in Poland, the club was largely unsuccessful in league meetings. During their seven years career in the Polish Football League, they scored 141 points, with the total goal quota of 120:186. In 1928 the club came 8th in the league, which was the highest location in its history. However, the following year Czarni&#x27;s forward Rochus Nastula was the top scorer in Polish Soccer League, with 25 goals scored in one season. In 1933 the club dropped from the first league, but continued to appear in national championships.
In 1935 the club won the Polish Cup (&quot;Mistrzostwa Polski&quot;). In the same year the club won also the Polish ice hockey title. In 1936 the name was changed back to &quot;Military and Civil Sports Club Sława Lwów&quot;. Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the city was occupied by the Soviet Union. The club was disbanded in 1939 by the NKVD who arrested most of its members. Two pre-war footballers, Henryk Bilor and Tadeusz Kowalski, and athlete Tadeusz Kirchner were among Poles murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

The most famous player of Czarni Lwów was Kazimierz Górski.

<text>Peel River, a watercourse that is part of the Namoi catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the North West Slopes and Plains district of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The river rises on the northern slopes of the Liverpool Range, at the junction of the Great Dividing Range and Mount Royal Range, south of the village of Nundle, and flows generally north, west and north west and emerges into the Liverpool Plains near Tamworth. The Peel River is joined by thirteen tributaries, including the Cockburn River, and flows through Chaffey Dam before reaching its mouth at the confluence with the Namoi River; dropping over its course of .

From source to mouth, the river passes through or near the villages of Nundle, Woolomin and Piallamore.

The Peel River was first discovered by European settlers in 1818 by John Oxley and named by Oxley in honour of Sir Robert Peel, an important British politician at the time of its discovery by British settlers in Australia.

At Tamworth, the river is crossed by the Main North line via the heritage-listed Tamworth rail bridge, completed in 1882.

The famous Australian freshwater native fish Murray cod, &quot;Maccullochella peelii&quot;, was named after the Peel River by Major Mitchell, who sketched and scientifically described and named one of the numerous Murray cod his men caught from the river on his 1838 expedition.

<doc id="718855" wikidata="Q1326714" url="?curid=718855" title="Self-organized criticality">
<text>Self-organized criticality (SOC) is a property of dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. Their macroscopic behavior thus displays the spatial or temporal scale-invariance characteristic of the critical point of a phase transition, but without the need to tune control parameters to a precise value, because the system, effectively, tunes itself as it evolves towards criticality.

The concept was put forward by Per Bak, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld (&quot;BTW&quot;) in a paper 
published in 1987 in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, and is considered to be one of the mechanisms by which complexity arises in nature. Its concepts have been applied across fields as diverse as geophysics, physical cosmology, evolutionary biology and ecology, bio-inspired computing and optimization (mathematics), economics, quantum gravity, sociology, solar physics, plasma physics, neurobiology and others.

SOC is typically observed in slowly driven non-equilibrium systems with many degrees of freedom and strongly nonlinear dynamics. Many individual examples have been identified since BTW&#x27;s original paper, but to date there is no known set of general characteristics that &quot;guarantee&quot; a system will display SOC.

== Overview ==

Self-organized criticality is one of a number of important discoveries made in statistical physics and related fields over the latter half of the 20th century, discoveries which relate particularly to the study of complexity in nature. For example, the study of cellular automata, from the early discoveries of Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann through to John Conway&#x27;s Game of Life and the extensive work of Stephen Wolfram, made it clear that complexity could be generated as an emergent feature of extended systems with simple local interactions. Over a similar period of time, Benoît Mandelbrot&#x27;s large body of work on fractals showed that much complexity in nature could be described by certain ubiquitous mathematical laws, while the extensive study of phase transitions carried out in the 1960s and 1970s showed how scale invariant phenomena such as fractals and power laws emerged at the critical point between phases.

The term &quot;self-organized criticality&quot; was first introduced in Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld&#x27;s 1987 paper, which clearly linked together those factors: a simple cellular automaton was shown to produce several characteristic features observed in natural complexity (fractal geometry, pink (1/f) noise and power laws) in a way that could be linked to critical-point phenomena. Crucially, however, the paper emphasized that the complexity observed emerged in a robust manner that did not depend on finely tuned details of the system: variable parameters in the model could be changed widely without affecting the emergence of critical behavior: hence, &quot;self-organized&quot; criticality. Thus, the key result of BTW&#x27;s paper was its discovery of a mechanism by which the emergence of complexity from simple local interactions could be &quot;spontaneous&quot;—and therefore plausible as a source of natural complexity—rather than something that was only possible in artificial situations in which control parameters are tuned to precise critical values. An alternative view is that SOC appears when the criticality is linked to a value of zero of the control parameters.

Despite the considerable interest and research output generated from the SOC hypothesis, there remains no general agreement with regards to its mechanisms in abstract mathematical form. Bak Tang and Wiesenfeld based their hypothesis on the behavior of their sandpile model.

== Models of self-organized criticality ==
In chronological order of development:

* Stick-slip model of fault failure
*Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile
* Forest-fire model
* Olami–Feder–Christensen model
* Bak–Sneppen model

Early theoretical work included the development of a variety of alternative SOC-generating dynamics distinct from the BTW model, attempts to prove model properties analytically (including calculating the critical exponents), and examination of the conditions necessary for SOC to emerge. One of the important issues for the latter investigation was whether conservation of energy was required in the local dynamical exchanges of models: the answer in general is no, but with (minor) reservations, as some exchange dynamics (such as those of BTW) do require local conservation at least on average .

It has been argued that the energy released in the BTW &quot;sandpile&quot; model should actually generate 1/f2 noise rather than 1/f noise. This claim was based on untested scaling assumptions, and a more rigorous analysis showed that sandpile models 
generally produce 1/fa spectra, with a&lt;2.
However, the dynamics of the accumulated stress does exhibit the 1/f noise in the BTW model.
Other simulation models were proposed later that could also produce true 1/f noise.

In addition to the nonconservative theoretical model mentioned above , other theoretical models for SOC have been based upon information theory, 
mean field theory,
the convergence of random variables, and cluster formation. A continuous model of self-organised criticality is proposed by using tropical geometry.

Key theoretical issues yet to be resolved include the calculation of the possible universality classes of SOC behavior and the question of whether it is possible to derive a general rule for determining if an arbitrary algorithm displays SOC.

==Self-organized criticality in nature==

SOC has become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including: 
* The magnitude of earthquakes (Gutenberg–Richter law) and frequency of aftershocks (Omori law) 
* Fluctuations in economic systems such as financial markets (references to SOC are common in econophysics) 
* The evolution of proteins
* Forest fires 
* Neuronal avalanches in the cortex
* Acoustic emission from fracturing materials

Despite the numerous applications of SOC to understanding natural phenomena, the universality of SOC theory has been questioned. For example, experiments with real piles of rice revealed their dynamics to be far more sensitive to parameters than originally predicted. Furthermore, it has been argued that 1/f scaling in EEG recordings are inconsistent with critical states, and whether SOC is a fundamental property of neural systems remains an open and controversial topic.

==Self-organized criticality and optimization==
It has been found that the avalanches from an SOC process make effective patterns in a random search for optimal solutions on graphs. 
An example of such an optimization problem is graph coloring. The SOC process apparently helps the optimization from getting stuck in a local optimum without the use of any annealing scheme, as suggested by previous work on extremal optimization.

<text>The Liverpool Range is a mountain range and a lava-field province in New South Wales, Australia.

The eastern peaks of the range were the traditional territory of the Wonnarua people.

==Geography==
The Liverpool Range starts from the volcanic plateau known as the Barrington Tops and runs for about westwards, forming the northern boundary of the Hunter Valley. Parts of the Liverpool Range form the watershed between the coastal and inland drainage of New South Wales and thus form a component of the Great Dividing Range. The western end of the Liverpool Range merges into the Warrumbungle Range.

The Liverpool Range has a reputation as a breeding ground for severe summer thunderstorms. The peaks of the range generally experience several snowfalls each winter.

==History==
The Liverpool Range was named after Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, who was the prime minister of the United Kingdom at the time of its exploration by Europeans. The higher parts of the Liverpool Range reach approximately above sea level, and the range formed a significant barrier to the expansion of settlement in the early period of British settlement in New South Wales.

The first route across the range was Pandoras Pass discovered by Allan Cunningham. This is located near the western end of the range, north from the town of Coolah and within Coolah Tops National Park. The crossing used by the New England Highway is Nowlands Gap (otherwise known as Murrurundi Gap), which crosses the range near its east end. The Main Northern railway line from Sydney to the Queensland border crosses under this pass via the Ardglen Tunnel.

The southern slopes of the Liverpool Range are drained by the headwaters of the Hunter River and its tributaries, such as the Pages River, which flows through the town of Murrurundi. The northern slopes are drained by the headwaters of the Peel River and the Mooki River. The Talbragar River and the Coolaburragundy River also rise on the range and flow south-west, joining near the town of Dunedoo.

<doc id="718864" wikidata="Q4294395" url="?curid=718864" title="Minister for Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia">
<text>The office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Abkhazia was created on 17 May 1993, during the 1992–1993 war with Georgia. Empirical data nevertheless show that Abkhazia&#x27;s Foreign Ministry also enacts (mostly low-level) diplomatic relations, such as the sending of diplomatic notes, with various countries across the world, including Nauru, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Syria. It is also active in managing relations with other post-Soviet de facto states such as South Ossetia, Transnistria, and the Lugansk People&#x27;s Republic.

==History==

===Government of President Ardzinba===

On 30 April 1997, former Aidgylara Chairman Sergei Shamba was appointed Foreign Minister instead of Konstantin Ozgan, who had been appointed First Vice Premier, succeeding Sergei Bagapsh, who had been appointed Prime Minister on 29 April.

Shamba remained Foreign Minister until he resigned on 15 June 2004 along with First Vice Premier Astamur Tarba (who eventually stayed on) and Security Service Chairman Givi Agrba following the murder of opposition politician Garri Aiba. Shamba was temporarily replaced by his deputy Gueorgui Otyrba on 18 July, and permanently by Abkhazia&#x27;s representative in Moscow Igor Akhba on 28 July. On 14 December 2004, following the Tangerine Revolution but while Vladislav Ardzinba was still president, he re-arranged the cabinet. Sergei Shamba was re-appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and additionally became Vice-Premier.

===Government of President Bagapsh===
After the election of Sergei Bagapsh as president, Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba was one of the few Ministers to be re-appointed, on 26 March 2005.

Following the re-election of Bagapsh, Shamba was appointed prime minister (as outgoing prime minister Alexander Ankvab had been elected vice president), he was succeeded by his deputy Maxim Gvinjia on 26 February.

===Government of President Ankvab===
After the election of Alexander Ankvab, he appointed diplomat and academic Viacheslav Chirikba as Foreign Minister On 11 October.

===Government of President Khajimba===
Chirikba was only one of three Cabinet members to be re-appointed in the cabinet of Prime Minister Beslan Butba following the May 2014 Revolution and the subsequent election of Raul Khajimba as president.

Chirikba was again re-appointed under Prime Minister Artur Mikvabia, but on 20 September 2016, after the appointment of Beslan Bartsits as Prime Minister, he released a statement in which he announced his resignation because he was unable to continue in his post under the current circumstances. The Presidential press service responded by claiming that Chirikba had not been re-appointed because he had failed to lead a delegation to Transnistria in early September. Chirikba refuted this in another statement in which he explained that he had not been able to lead the delegation due to an attack of hypertension and claimed that the decision to re-appoint him had already been made at that point and that he had originally submitted his resignation on 31 August after Khajimba had for more than a month refused to meet him to discuss foreign affairs. In a press conference one week later, Khajimba specified that Chirikba had not been active enough as Foreign Minister and that as head of the Ministry, he had to be held responsible for certain financial irregularities that had been uncovered by the Control Chamber. On 4 October Chirikba&#x27;s successor Daur Kove was appointed. In the intervening period, Deputy Minister Oleg Arshba had served as acting minister.

<doc id="718867" wikidata="Q3501092" url="?curid=718867" title="Shua language">
<text>Shua , or &quot;Shwakhwe&quot;, is a Khoe language (Central Khoisan) of Botswana. It is spoken in central Botswana (in Nata and its surroundings), and in parts of the Chobe District in the extreme north of Botswana. There are approximately 6,000 speakers (Cook 2004) and approximately 2,000 out of those 6,000 speakers are native speakers. The linguistic variety spoken in the township of Nata in northeast Botswana is highly endangered and spoken fluently only by adults over about thirty years of age. The term &quot;Shwakhwe&quot; means people (&quot;khwe&quot;) from the salty area (&quot;shwa&quot;).

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
* // is only phonemic in the Tsʼixa and Danisi dialects.

=== Vowels ===
Shua has the five vowels , and three nasal vowels .

==Syntax==
Unlike most Khoisan languages, but like Nama, the most neutral word order is SOV, though word order is relatively free. As with most Khoisan languages, there are postpositions. There is a tense-aspect marker &quot;ke&quot; which often appears in second position in affirmative sentences in the present tense, giving X Aux S O V order (e.g. S Aux O V).

This marker appears first in certain subordinate clauses in a manner reminiscent of V2 languages such as German, where a clause-initial complementizer is in complementary distribution with a second position phenomenon (in German, it would be the finite verb which appears in second position).

===Numerals===

Shua has indigenous terms for numeral terms, it is a restrictive and limited system of numerals.

* &quot;|uˉiˉ&quot; ‘one’
* &quot;|am&quot; ‘two’
* &quot;ngona: ~ ‖obeˉ:ˉ&quot; ‘three’
* &quot;hatsa:&quot; ‘four’
* &quot;|’oˉra:&quot; ‘a few’
* &quot;‖hara:&quot; ‘many’ 

Using this example, the numeral comes before the head noun. More specifically, it appears in the second &quot;opening&quot; of a noun phrase &quot;following a demonstrative or determiner (if there is one), and preceding a qualifying nominal or adjective.&quot;

==Dialects==
Shua is a dialect cluster. 
*Deti (10 or fewer speakers)
*Ganádi
*Shwa-khwe
*Nǀoo-khwe
*Kǀoree-khoe &quot;or&quot; ǀOree-khwe
*ǁʼAiye &quot;or&quot; ǀAaye
*ǀXaise &quot;or&quot; ǀTaise
*Tshidi-khwe &quot;or&quot; Tcaiti &quot;or&quot; Sili &quot;or&quot; Shete Tsere
*Danisi &quot;or&quot; Demisa &quot;or&quot; Madenasse &quot;or&quot; Madinnisane
*Cara
*ǁGoro (ǁ᪶Oro) &quot;or&quot; ǀXaio

The term Hietshware (Hietʃware, Hietʃo) is used for varieties of both Shua and its sister-language Tshwa.

Tsʼixa (200 speakers) is evidently a distinct language.

<text>The Clyde River (Dhurga: &quot;Bhundoo&quot;) is an open intermediate tide-dominated drowned valley estuary or perennial river that flows into the Tasman Sea at Batemans Bay, located in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
The Clyde River rises below Kangaroo Hill in the Budawang Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, within Budawang National Park, south of the locality of Sassafras, and flows generally southwards parallel to the east coast, joined by nine tributaries including the Bimberamala, Yadboro, and Buckenbowra rivers, before turning east and reaching its mouth of the Tasman Sea at Batemans Bay. The river descends over its course.

The lower reaches of the Clyde River form a substantial estuary up to from its mouth which is navigable by small vessels to Nelligen, with a tidal ebb of up to . The coastal estuary covers a catchment area of and contains approximately of water over an estimated surface area of ; and at an average depth of .

The river is one of the last major rivers in eastern Australia that has not been dammed. Porters Creek, a tributary of one of the Clyde&#x27;s tributaries, Pigeon House Creek, is dammed by the Porters Creek Dam, which supplies water to coastal towns.

In its upper reaches, the river forms within the Budawang National Park; while in its lower reaches, the river flows through the Clyde River National Park.

Water quality of the basin is very good. The upper catchment is heavily timbered (state forests and national parks); there is a small amount of logging in the Yadboro State Forest. There are no polluting industries in its catchment, nor any sewage outflows, and thus the river has a reputation for the cleanest, least polluted waters of any major river in eastern Australia.

Salinity in the estuary of the Clyde River decreases with distance from the sea, giving rise to suitable conditions for oyster farming.

==History and naming==
The region was first occupied by the Walbunja people from the Yuin nation.
Their name for the river, &quot;Bhundoo&quot;, means &quot;Deep Water&quot;.

The river was given the name &quot;Clyde River&quot; after the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland, by Lieutenant Robert Johnston, who navigated the river aboard the cutter &quot;Snapper&quot; on 1 December 1821.

== Crossings ==
The river crossings, from its headwaters to its river mouth, include:

* Yadboro Flats bridge, from Yadboro Road to Western Distributor Road, downstream from the junction with Yadboro River
* Clyde Ridge Road bridge
* Shallow Crossing, on The River Road, a concrete causeway/ford, at the tidal limit of the Clyde estuary
* Nelligen Bridge, on the Kings Highway
* Batemans Bay bridge, on the Princes Highway. The old steel truss bridge has been replaced by a new, higher bridge with two lanes for traffic in each direction. The new bridge formally opened on 27 March 2021, after which the old bridge was dismantled. The new bridge is designed to ease traffic congestion and delays caused by the limitations of the old bridge, which only had one narrow lane in each direction. In addition, the old bridge had a central section which is raised to allow tall watercraft to pass underneath. This meant regular delays for local and holiday traffic which was frequently backed up for several kilometres as a result.

<doc id="718884" wikidata="Q697763" url="?curid=718884" title="Massacre of Lwów professors">
<text>In July 1941, 25 Polish academics from the city of Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) along with the 25 of their family members were killed by Nazi German occupation forces. By targeting prominent citizens and intellectuals for elimination, the Nazis hoped to prevent anti-Nazi activity and to weaken the resolve of the Polish resistance movement. According to an eyewitness the executions were carried out by an &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; unit () under the command of Karl Eberhard Schöngarth with the participation of Ukrainian translators in German uniforms.
==Background==
Before September 1939 and the German invasion of Poland, Lwów, then in the Second Polish Republic, had 318,000 inhabitants of different ethnic groups and religions, 60% of whom were Poles, 30% Jews and about 10% Ukrainians and Germans. The city was one of the most important cultural centers of interwar Poland, housing five tertiary educational facilities, including Lwów University and Lwów Polytechnic. It was the home for many Polish and Polish Jewish intellectuals, political and cultural activists, scientists and members of Poland&#x27;s interwar intelligentsia.

After Lwów was occupied by the Soviet Union in September 1939, Lwów University was renamed in honor of Ivan Franko, a major Ukrainian literary figure who lived in Lwów, and the language of instruction was changed from Polish to Ukrainian. Lwów was captured by German forces on 30 June 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Along with German Wehrmacht units, a number of &quot;Abwehr&quot; and SS formations entered the city. During the German occupation of Poland, almost all of the 120,000 Jewish inhabitants of the city were killed, within the city&#x27;s ghetto or in Bełżec extermination camp. By the end of the war, only 200–800 Jews survived.

To control the population, prominent citizens and intellectuals, particularly Jews and Poles, were either confined in ghettos or transported to execution sites such as the Gestapo prison on Pełczyńska Street, the Brygidki Prison, the former military prison at Zamarstynów and to the fields surrounding the city — in the suburb of Winniki, the Kortumówka hills and the Jewish Cemetery. Many of those killed were prominent leaders of Polish society: politicians, artists, aristocrats, sportsmen, scientists, priests, rabbis and other members of the intelligentsia. This mass murder is regarded as a pre-emptive measure to keep the Polish resistance scattered and to prevent Poles from revolting against Nazi rule. It was a direct continuation of the infamous German AB-Aktion in Poland, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the eastern half of prewar Poland fell under German occupation in place of that of the USSR. One of the earliest Nazi crimes in Lwów was the mass murder of Polish professors together with some of their relatives and guests, carried out at the beginning of July 1941.

==Killings==

By 2 July 1941, the individual, planned executions continued. At approximately 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, Professor Kazimierz Bartel was arrested by one of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; operating in the area. During the night of 3/4 July, several dozen professors and their families were arrested by German detachments – each one consisting of an officer, several soldiers, Ukrainian guides and interpreters. The lists were prepared by their Ukrainian students associated with OUN. Some of the professors mentioned on the lists were already dead, specifically Adam Bednarski and Roman Leszczyński. Among those arrested was Roman Rencki, a director of the Clinic for Internal Diseases at Lwów University, who was kept in an NKVD prison and whose name was also on the list of Soviet prisoners sentenced to death.
The detainees were transported to the Abrahamowicz&#x27;s dormitory, where despite the initial intention to kill them, they were tortured and interrogated. The head of the department in the Jewish hospital, Adam Ruff, was shot during an epileptic attack.

In the early morning of 4 July, one of the professors and most of his servants were set free while the rest were either brought to the Wulka hills or shot to death in the courtyard of the &quot;Bursa Abrahamowiczów&quot; building. The victims were buried on the spot, but several days after the massacre their bodies were exhumed and transported by the Wehrmacht to an unknown place. There are accounts of four different methods used by the German troops. The victims were either beaten to death, killed with a bayonet, killed with a hammer, or shot to death. The professors themselves were shot to death.

==Responsibility==

The decision was made at the highest level of Nazi Germany&#x27;s leadership. The direct decision maker of the massacre was the commander of the Sicherheitspolizei (&quot;Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD&quot;- BdS) in Krakau District of the General Government, Karl Eberhard Schöngarth. The following Gestapo officers also participated: Walter Kutschmann, Felix Landau, Heinz Heim (Chief of Staff Schöngarth), Hans Krueger and Kurt Stawizki. None of them were ever punished for their roles in the Lwów massacre, albeit Schöngarth, Landau, and Krueger were punished for other crimes, with Schöngarth being executed in 1946. Kutschmann lived under a false identity in Argentina until January 1975, when he was found and exposed by journalist Alfredo Serra in the resort town of Miramar. He was arrested ten years later in Florida, Buenos Aires, by Interpol agents but died of a heart attack in jail before he could be extradited to then West Germany, on 30 August 1986.

Some sources contend that members of the Ukrainian auxiliaries from the Nachtigall Battalion were responsible for the murders. According to the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, this claim originated with the Soviet sources and has been disputed. Memorial has published documents which claim to document the Nachtigall participation in those events as a KGB disinformation. Stanisław Bogaczewicz, of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance said that Nachtigall soldiers took part in the arrests, but not in the murders, and that their role in this event needs further investigation. Sociologist Tadeusz Piotrowski noted that while the Nachtigall role is disputed, they were present in the town during the events, their activities are not properly documented, and that at the very least they are guilty of the passive collaboration in this event, for not opposing the atrocities. According to a Lviv historian, Vasyl Rasevych, the claims that Ukrainians participated in the July 1941 massacre are untrue and that no archival evidence exists to support this contention.

==Aftermath==
After World War II the leadership of the Soviet Union made attempts to diminish the Polish cultural and historic legacy of Lwów. Crimes committed east of the Curzon line could not be prosecuted by Polish courts. Information on the atrocities that took place in Lwów was restricted. In 1960, Helena Krukowska, the widow of Włodzimierz Krukowski, launched an appeal to a court in Hamburg. After five years the West German court closed the judicial proceedings. A West German public prosecutor claimed the people responsible for the crime were already dead, however Hans Krueger, commander of the Gestapo unit supervising the massacres in Lwów in 1941, was being held in a Hamburg prison, having been sentenced to life imprisonment for the mass murder of Polish Jews of the Stanisławów Ghetto committed several weeks after his unit was transferred from Lwów. As a result, nobody has ever been held responsible for the killings of the academics.

In the 1970s, Abrahamowicz Street in Lviv was renamed Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński Street. Various Polish organisations have made deputations to remember the victims of the atrocity with a monument or a symbolic grave in Lviv. The case of the murder of the professors is currently under investigation by the Institute of National Remembrance. In May 2009, the monument to the victims in Lviv was defaced with red paint bearing the words &quot;Death to the Lachs [Poles]&quot;. On 3 July 2011, a memorial dedicated to the Polish professors murdered by the Gestapo on 4 July 1941 opened in Lviv.

<text>Otto Wels (15 September 1873 – 16 September 1939) was a German politician who served as a member of the Reichstag from 1912 to 1933 and as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from 1919 until his death in 1939. He was military commander of Berlin in the turbulent early days of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and during the 1920 Kapp Putsch he was instrumental in organizing the general strike that helped defeat the anti-republican putschists. Near the end of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s life, however, he saw the futility of calling a general strike against the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état because of the mass unemployment of the Great Depression.

His 1933 speech in the Reichstag in opposition to Adolf Hitler and the Enabling Act marked the end of the Weimar Republic prior to the Act becoming law. After passage of the Act effectively gave Hitler dictatorial power, Wels fled the country and established the SPD exile organization Sopade. He died in Paris in 1939, two weeks after the start of World War II.

==Early life and career==
Born in Berlin on 15 September 1873, Wels was the son of an innkeeper (Johann Wels and his wife Johanne). The restaurant, which served as a meeting place for early SPD supporters, exposed Wels to the workers&#x27; movement at a young age. In 1891 he began an apprenticeship as a paper hanger and joined the SPD. Around 1893, he married Bertha Antonie Reske, a seamstress. They had two sons, Walter and Hugo. In the early 1890s, he represented other workers in the Berlin Craftsmen&#x27;s Chamber and was elected the first chairman of the local SPD branch. From 1895 to 1897 he performed his military service in the German Army, where he was harassed by officers due to his politics (he was not granted leave during his entire service period). On finishing his military service, he enrolled at the Workers&#x27; Educational Society in Berlin before returning to politics. He was unsuccessful in his re-election bid for SPD local chairman (District Five) but continued to campaign until he was elected a representative in the new SPD party organisation in 1901.

From 1906 he worked as a trade union official and party secretary in the Province of Brandenburg and on the press committee of &quot;Vorwärts&quot;, the SPD&#x27;s party newspaper. In 1912 he was elected to the Reichstag, and with the support of August Bebel, the chairman and one of the founders of the SPD, he joined the SPD executive committee the next year. His position on the committee allowed him to take a central role in the development of the SPD.

During the First World War, Wels supported &quot;Burgfriedenspolitik&quot;, the political truce between Germany&#x27;s political parties under which the trade unions refrained from striking, the SPD voted for war credits and the parties agreed not to criticize the government and its handling of the war.

== Weimar Republic ==
=== German Revolution ===
On 9 November 1918, the date of the proclamation of the republic in Germany, Wels spoke to the Naumburg rifle brigade at their request to explain the political situation following the collapse of the German Empire at the end of World War I. The brigade was one of the units considered especially loyal to Emperor Wilhelm II that had been brought into the city as reinforcements against revolutionary activity. Wels convinced the soldiers that to avoid a civil war they should not use their weapons. At the end of his speech, the brigade went over in a body to the side of the supporters of the German Revolution. Buoyed by his success, Wels spoke at other barracks so persuasively that he was credited with keeping the death toll that day to just fifteen.

Also on 9 November, Wels became a member of the revolutionary Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Council of Berlin. He advocated successfully for the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) – a more leftist and anti-war group that had broken away from the SPD in 1917 – to be represented equally with the SPD on the Council. The next day he was made military commander of Berlin.

=== Christmas crisis ===
The &quot;Volksmarinedivision&quot; was the revolution&#x27;s main military unit in Berlin and as such under Wels&#x27; control. In December 1918, the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies, Germany&#x27;s temporary government, ordered the division to move outside Berlin and reduce the number of its soldiers. When they refused, Wels withheld their pay to force them to comply. During the week before Christmas, he attempted to negotiate with them, but when no progress was made, they detained and maltreated him. Assaults on the division&#x27;s locations at the Berlin Palace and Neuer Marstall by regular troops loyal to the government – the 1918 Christmas crisis – failed to dislodge the mutineers. Negotiations led to a compromise under which the &quot;Volksmarinedivision&quot;, in exchange for receiving its back pay and remaining a unit, vacated the Palace and Marstall and freed Wels, who was forced to step down from his position as city commander.

=== Crises of the republic ===

After Friedrich Ebert of the SPD was elected German President on 11 February 1919, Wels acted as the party&#x27;s presiding officer and was formally elected co-chairman with Hermann Müller on 14 June. From 6 February 1919 to 21 May 1920, Wels was a member of the Weimar National Assembly, Germany&#x27;s interim parliament and constitutional convention, where he sat on the Committee for the Preliminary Consultation of the Draft Constitution of the German Reich. Following the completion of the Assembly&#x27;s work, he was elected to the new Reichstag of the Weimar Republic.

During the 1920 Kapp Putsch, Wels and union leader Carl Legien led the general strike that was central to ending the putsch, and afterwards demanded the resignation of his party colleague Gustav Noske as Reichswehr minister. He played a key role in founding the paramilitary Iron Front and &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot; in defence of Germany&#x27;s parliamentary democracy against the rising extremist forces of the Nazi &quot;SA&quot;, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and the communist-led &quot;Rotfrontkämpferbund&quot;.

In 1923 Wels became a member of the executive board of the Labour and Socialist International.

After the 1930 Reichstag election, which saw the Nazi Party gain 95 seats, Wels advocated the toleration of the cabinet of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning even though Brüning was heading a presidential cabinet that bypassed the Reichstag and ruled by presidential decree. The SPD feared that if they voted for a no-confidence motion against Brüning there could be new elections that would strengthen the Nazi&#x27;s position even more.

In the July 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état, Chancellor Franz von Papen ousted the elected government of Prussia and took over control of Germany&#x27;s largest state as Reich Commissioner, a move that was seen as a major blow to democracy in the Republic. Wels nevertheless argued against calling a general strike to oppose Papen. Because of the mass unemployment in Germany at the time, Wels thought that workers would not be able to force Papen to back down. Following the Reichstag election of November 1932 in which the Nazis lost seats, Wels rejected any negotiations with the new chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher.

== Enabling Act ==

Wels had underestimated Adolf Hitler and was taken by surprise when President Paul von Hindenburg named him chancellor on 30 January 1933. The SPD saw the move as constitutional and called on its members to use restraint. Following the promulgation of the Reichstag Fire Decree on 28 February, Wels was threatened with arrest and fled with his family to Austria, but he returned in early March. The SPD by then saw that the proposed Enabling Act, which would give Hitler&#x27;s cabinet the right to pass laws without the consent of the Reichstag for a period of four years, presented a mortal threat to the rule of law and the democratic constitution. When they decided to oppose it, Wels volunteered to give the speech against Hitler, saying &quot;I will do it. (...) This is about the party and the honour of the party.&quot;

=== Speech in opposition ===
Wels gave his speech on 23 March 1933, during the last session of the multi-party Reichstag. He began by agreeing with Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler&#x27;s demand for equal treatment of Germany among the nations of the world and stated that he, Wels, &quot;was the first German who stood up to the untruth of Germany’s guilt for the outbreak of the world war before an international forum&quot;. He went on to say that the SPD agreed with another statement of Hitler&#x27;s, that &quot;from the lunacy of the theory of eternal winners and losers came the madness of reparations and, in their wake, the catastrophe of the world economy&quot;. He then quoted from the speech that Chancellor Gustav Bauer of the SPD gave on 23 July 1919 following the resignation of the Scheidemann cabinet in protest against the terms of the Treaty of Versailles:We are defenseless; defenseless but not without honor []. To be sure, the enemies are after our honor, there is no doubt. However, that this attempt at defamation will one day redound back upon the instigators, that it is not our honor that is being destroyed by this global catastrophe, that is our belief to the last breath.Wels used Bauer&#x27;s words in order to turn them against Hitler and the Nazis. Equal treatment, he argued, is as necessary for a nation internally as it is internationally. Defeated political opponents cannot be proscribed: &quot;Freedom and life can be taken from us, but not our honor.&quot; He went on to enumerate the major accomplishments of the SPD in the Weimar Reichstag and accused the National Socialists of being nationalist but not socialist. If they were socialist, he said, they would have the people behind them and not need an Enabling Act. The SPD understood the Nazi&#x27;s form of power politics and also that the people&#x27;s sense of justice was a political power to which they would continue to appeal.In this historic hour, we German Social Democrats solemnly pledge ourselves to the principles of humanity and justice, of freedom and socialism. No Enabling Act gives you the power to destroy ideas that are eternal and indestructible. ... German social democracy will draw new strength also from the latest persecutions. We greet the persecuted and the oppressed. We greet our friends in Germany. Your steadfastness and loyalty deserve admiration. The courage of your convictions and your unbroken optimism guarantee a brighter future.All 94 SPD members of the Reichstag who were present voted against the act. Using the powers of the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Nazis had detained several SPD deputies, and others had already fled into exile. The Communists had been banned and so could not vote. The rest of the Reichstag voted in favour. Nazi intimidation had worked so well that even if all 120 SPD deputies had been present and voted against it, the Enabling Act would have still passed with the required two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment.

The passage of the Enabling Act marked the end of parliamentary democracy in Germany and formed the legal authority for Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship. Within weeks of the passage of the Enabling Act, the Hitler government banned the SPD, and the other German political parties chose to dissolve to avoid persecution, making the Nazi Party the only legal political party in Germany.

== Exile and death ==
In June 1933, Wels went into exile in the Territory of the Saar Basin, which at the time was under League of Nations control. From there he moved to exile in Prague, where he established the Sopade, the exile organization of the SPD. In August 1933, he was deprived of his German citizenship.

As a result of the Munich Agreement, Wels had to leave Prague and went to Paris at the end of 1938, where he died on 16 September 1939 at the age of 66. He was buried in the Cimetière Nouveau cemetery at Châtenay-Malabry.

== Legacy ==
In his memoirs, the former chancellor Heinrich Brüning described Otto Wels as &quot;Germany&#x27;s bravest man in the fight against Hitler&quot;.

<doc id="718890" wikidata="Q646906" url="?curid=718890" title="Moruya River">
<text>The Moruya River is an open and trained mature wave dominated barrier estuary or tidal river is located in the South Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. In its upper freshwater reaches, the river is known as the Deua River.

==Course and features==
The headwaters of the Deua River rise south of Braidwood and flow to the village of Kiora where the Deua River forms its confluence with the Moruya River. The Moruya River flows generally east, joined by two minor tributaries, past the town of Moruya, before reaching its mouth of the Tasman Sea at Moruya Heads. The river descends over its course.

===Barrier entrance===

The river has a bar at its confluence with the Tasman Sea. Work on the river training walls was concentrated in 1907, following extensive siltation of the river opening. The dredge &quot;Antleon&quot; was based there during the 1920s, when in 1924, the steamer &quot;Benandra&quot; was wrecked at the entrance. Work on the break walls was completed in 1925 when huge storms required some repairs to the training walls. The port gained greater significance in 1924 when a stone quarry was opened and used to supply granite for the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the stone for the Cenotaph in Martin Place. The Public Works Department built a wharf adjacent to the quarry fore ease of use. Extensions to the southern training walls were undertaken between 1931 and 1933, with major additional works from 1946 to 1954. The bar is dangerous to shipping and as a result of its hazards for smaller ships and because it prevented access by larger ones, the major settlement in the area was first developed at nearby Broulee. In 1841 a flood cleared the bar and the town of Moruya, now accessible to shipping, developed at the expense of the settlement at Broulee despite later recurring problems with the bar, not least as it was the easiest point to access the rich Araluen goldfields from the 1850s.

The bar is now managed in part by a rock breakwall on the northern side of the river.

==History==

The river was previously navigable by coastal shipping to Moruya and was serviced by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company. The &quot;Benandra&quot;, a wooden screw steamer operated by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company to transport cargo, was lost on 25 March 1924 when it hit the sandspit near the bar. At least one person died.

The Princes Highway crosses the Moruya River at Moruya. The first bridge across the Moruya River was erected in 1876. Due to frequent flooding new bridges were erected in 1900 and 1945 and, most recently, in 1966.

==Nature==

===Wildlife===
Coast-favoring southern right whales may enter into the river mouth. &quot;Mordacia praecox&quot; is a species of southern topeyed lamprey that is found only in the Moroya and Tuross Rivers.

<doc id="718894" wikidata="Q283795" url="?curid=718894" title="Donald Brashear">
<text>Donald Brashear (born January 7, 1972) is an American - Canadian professional hockey player currently playing for Jonquière Marquis in the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey (LNAH). He previously played for five organizations in the National Hockey League (NHL) over a 23-year pro career, in which he played the role of an enforcer.

He was among the NHL leaders in penalty minutes for six seasons, while finishing his career 15th all-time in penalty minutes. He remains the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; all-time single-season leader in penalty minutes, which he set in the 1997–98 season.

He was involved in one of the most publicized incidents of on-ice violence in NHL history during the 1999–2000 season, when he was slashed in the head by Marty McSorley.

==Early life==
Brashear was born in Bedford, Indiana, but moved to Val-Bélair, Quebec, his mother&#x27;s ancestral village, as a child.

Brashear is the youngest of three children born to an American father, Johnny Brashear, and Nicole Gauthier, who was mainly of French-Canadian descent, in Bedford, Indiana. His father was an alcoholic who relentlessly abused his family, including slashing Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one occasion, when Donald was only six months old, he picked him up and hurled him through a window. Nicole, afraid that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later, she came back to take the children but left Donald to live with his father for another four years, until Donald&#x27;s paternal grandmother sent him to Canada. Donald&#x27;s mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and wanted to avoid having another mixed-race child in the house.

Brashear eventually moved in with his mother and stepfather in Lorretteville, Quebec. Because of his stepfather&#x27;s racist attitude, he suffered further abuse in his new surroundings; for instance, he was forced to sleep with a garbage bag tied around his waist to keep him from wetting the bed and was verbally berated for not being able to tie his shoes. His mother finally decided to give him up to foster care, due in part because of what she called &quot;mental problems&quot; from the abuse he had suffered, and because he did not accept her as his mother. Brashear lived in two different foster homes that sent him away since the families believed he was a &quot;little too much to handle.&quot;

At the age of eight, Brashear moved to Val-Bélair, Quebec, and settled into a new foster home. Once there, he began playing hockey with his new siblings. To help pay for hockey, Brashear sold baked bread and garbage bags door-to-door, and later became a paper boy. He played in the 1984, 1985 and 1986 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with three separate minor ice hockey teams from Quebec City.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
Brashear was signed as a free agent by the Montreal Canadiens in 1992. He spent parts of three seasons with their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens, before becoming a regular with Montreal at the NHL level. During the 1993–94 AHL season, he registered professional career highs of 38 goals and 66 points, along with 250 Penalty Minutes (PIMs) in 62 games. His 38 goals tied him for the team lead and the 250 PIMs led Fredericton. Brashear made his NHL debut on November 15, 1993, against the Ottawa Senators. He registered an assist in the contest, his first career NHL point. Two days later, he scored his first NHL goal in a game against the Edmonton Oilers. After playing parts of four seasons with the Canadiens, his time in Montreal ended following a heated verbal exchange with Head Coach Mario Tremblay during a team practice on November 9, 1996. Four days later, Brashear was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Jassen Cullimore. Brashear finished the year with 13 points and 245 PIMs, seventh-highest in the NHL.

The following season, 1997–98, Brashear led the NHL in penalty minutes and set a Canucks franchise record with 372 PIMs, while adding 18 points. During the season, he also received a four-game suspension for delivering a blind-side punch to Ian Laperrière. Brashear stated that he hit Laperrière in retaliation to Laperrière punching Brashear&#x27;s teammate Gino Odjick from behind. The 1998–99 season marked the only time in his career which he played in all 82 games, again leading the Canucks in penalty minutes and finishing eighth in the NHL. In the 1999–2000 season, Brashear set a career-high in goals with 11, but the season was marred by one of the most published incidents of excessive violence in the modern era of hockey.

===McSorley incident===
During a February 21, 2000 Canucks home game against the Boston Bruins, Brashear was involved in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and, on his way to the penalty box, taunted the Bruins&#x27; bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley was eager for a rematch with Brashear, who refused to fight again. With 4.6 seconds left in the game, a frustrated McSorley finally swung his stick toward Brashear&#x27;s head from behind and struck him with a two-handed slash to the right temple. Brashear collapsed to the ice immediately, with his helmet falling off as the back of his head struck the ice. He suffered a seizure and the slash resulted in a grade-three concussion. Canucks goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn&#x27;t get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 seconds left in the game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.

The case went to trial in British Columbia, where Brashear testified that he had no memory of the incident. McSorley testified that he tried to hit Brashear in the shoulder to start a fight with him, but missed, resulting in the head shot. McSorley was found guilty but avoided a jail sentence. He was required to complete 18 months of probation, in which he was not allowed to play in a game against Brashear. Brashear returned to play before the end of the season. McSorley, who missed the remaining 23 games of the regular season, had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction. The incident effectively ended McSorley&#x27;s career, as he never played in another NHL game. Brashear was often asked later if he ever talked with McSorley about the incident, and always responded the same way: he and McSorley had no relationship prior to it, and had no plans to ever speak to each other about what had happened.

===Mid-career===
Brashear played in 79 games the following season, registering 19 assists and 28 points. After leading the Canucks in penalty minutes for the previous four seasons, Brashear was traded 31 games into the 2001–02 season to the Philadelphia Flyers. The Flyers received Brashear and the Canucks&#x27; sixth-round draft pick in 2002 in exchange for Jan Hlaváč and the Flyers&#x27; third-round pick in the same draft. While splitting time between the two franchises, Brashear set a career-high in points (32) while also amassing 199 PIMs. In 2002–03, he recorded eight goals, 25 points and 161 PIMs. Thanks in part to his strong work ethic, he was awarded the Pelle Lindbergh Memorial Trophy, an annual award given to the Flyers&#x27; most improved player. During the 2003–04 season, he was among the League leaders in PIMs, registering 212, ranking him fifth overall. His PIM total was aided by his role in the most penalized game in NHL history. On March 5, 2004, the Flyers were defeating the Ottawa Senators 5–2, when with 1:45 remaining in the game, Brashear fought Ottawa enforcer Rob Ray. The fight was believed to be in retaliation to Flyers forward Mark Recchi being slashed in the face by the Senators Martin Havlát. Following Brashear&#x27;s fight, five separate brawls broke out. For his role in starting the fighting, Brashear was assessed 34 PIMs, more than any other Flyer. When asked later why he started the fighting, he responded by saying, &quot;Why wouldn’t I? Did you see the last game?&quot;

Due to the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little to protect him from players wanting to make a name for themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.

Following the lockout, Brashear voiced his displeasure with the new way the League called games, stating that the NHL changed the rules to favor &quot;superstars,&quot; and he felt that there was no longer a way to &quot;get respect&quot; on the ice. His statement came following a game in which he attempted to fight Darius Kasparaitis, who the Flyers believed delivered a &quot;cheap shot&quot; to Simon Gagné in an Olympic game earlier in the year. After Kasparaitis refused to fight Brashear at various points in the game, Brashear hit Kasparaitis with a gloved punch with 1:53 remaining in the game. Kasparaitis did not fight back and instead covered up to protect himself. Brashear was assessed 29 PIMs for the incident, including an instigator penalty. Brashear was given a one-game suspension due to new League rules for the 2005–06 season; any player given an instigator penalty in the final five minutes of regulation or overtime would receive an automatic one-game suspension. At the end of the year, he was again in the top ten (eighth) in PIMs, accumulating 166, but his offensive production dropped to a mere nine points. The Flyers opted not to re-sign the enforcer.

The Washington Capitals then signed Brashear on July 14, 2006, to a one-year, $1 million contract. The signing was to provide Alexander Ovechkin with some on-ice protection. Capitals management felt that Brashear was skilled enough not to be a liability on the team while bringing an intimidating presence. During the 2006–07 season, the Capitals decided to extend Brashear&#x27;s contract, signing him to a one-year, $1.1 million contract extension. He was suspended one game by the NHL during the regular season for punching New York Rangers defenceman Aaron Ward following a fight between Brashear and Brendan Shanahan. In the game, Shanahan felt Brashear was taking liberties with Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, and subsequently challenged Brashear to a fight. Brashear won the fight and motioned as if he was dusting off his hands. Ward then approached him and had words with Brashear, who responded by punching him in the face, earning Brashear a game misconduct for intent to injure and eventually the suspension. At season&#x27;s end, his point total increased from the previous season to 13 and his 156 PIMs ranked him in the top ten (sixth) in the League for the sixth time in his career. In the 2007–08 season, Brashear played in 80 games for the Capitals, but his offensive production slipped down to eight points while registering only 119 PIMs. However, he served as one of the Capitals&#x27; alternate captains. On January 24, 2008, the Capitals once again re-signed Brashear, this time to a one-year, $1.2 million extension.

In the 2008–09 season, Brashear&#x27;s point total dropped to four, his lowest total since 1995–96 while he was with the Montreal Canadiens. During the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs, he earned a suspension for two separate on-ice incidents. On April 26, 2009, the Capitals faced the New York Rangers in Game 6 of their first-round series. In the pre-game warm-ups, Brashear shoved Rangers enforcer Colton Orr, then delivered a blind-side hit to Blair Betts mid-way through the game&#x27;s first period. As a result of the hit, and a possible elbow, Betts suffered a broken orbital bone and was out indefinitely. Colin Campbell ruled that the hit was late on an unsuspecting player; he also believed it targeted the head, and as a result caused significant injury. For his actions, Brashear was given a six-game suspension by the League — one for the pre-game altercation and five for the hit on Betts.

===Later career===
Brashear was not given an extension during the season, and before the start of the free agency, he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)&#x27;s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.

Brashear struggled in New York, however, registering just one assist and 73 PIMs in 36 games; he became unhappy with his role in New York and asked the Rangers for a trade. Following a stretch of seven-straight and 12 of 13 games where he was a healthy scratch, the Rangers placed Brashear on waivers. After clearing waivers, he was assigned to the Rangers&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. Despite the demotion, Brashear was happy to be receiving steady ice time whilst in Hartford.

At the end of the season, the Rangers again placed Brashear on waivers, making him eligible for a contract buyout. Instead of buying-out his contract, however, the Rangers traded Brashear on August 2, 2010, along with Patrick Rissmiller, to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for centre Todd White. Atlanta then placed Brashear on waivers and bought-out the remaining year of his contract, thus making him an unrestricted free agent. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Brashear ranked 15th all-time in NHL history for penalty minutes.

After not receiving serious interest from any NHL teams, Brashear opted to return to the LNAH and signed with Sorel-Tracy GCI. He noted that his decision was based on his desire to continue playing hockey, his love for playing in the province of Quebec, and a chance to reunite with some former teammates. He was later traded during the season to Rivière-du-Loup 3L to add talent and toughness to the team. Rivière-du-Loup considered the acquisition of Brashear a &quot;coup,&quot; noting that they could not pass up the chance to add him to the team. Late in the season, Brashear was given a suspension following his actions in a brawl against Trois-Rivières. During the melee, Brashear &quot;attacked&quot; goaltender Julien Ellis after he slashed one of Brashear&#x27;s teammates who was engaged in a different fight. Brashear hit Ellis with several gloved punches before one of Ellis&#x27; teammates attempted to restrain Brashear. Brashear fought with the intervening player and after falling to the ice, Brashear continued to punch the &quot;defenceless&quot; player. He went back after the goaltender before a linesman tackled him. The suspension was originally set at eight games, but after the League met with Brashear and Rivière-du-Loup&#x27;s general manager, it was reduced to five games.

In November 2014, Brashear stepped out of retirement and signed a contract with Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) for the remainder of the season. He scored once on a power play on March 16, 2015 against Vita Hästen.

Brasher returned to the LNAH for one more season in 2015–2016, but would only play 7 games before retiring. He would later return to the LNAH 8 years later in the 2023–2024 season, coming out of retirement once again, to play for the Jonquiere Marquis, getting into a fight in his first game.

==International play==
Brashear has represented the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later noted that he was surprised by the invitation, but felt that it allowed him to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.

==Playing style==

Brashear was an enforcer; his role was to protect his teammates if an opponent went beyond what is considered acceptable physical play to &quot;dirty&quot; play or taking &quot;cheap shots.&quot; Brashear was a tenacious forechecker, who created momentum by playing aggressively and delivering body checks, while possessing an underrated shot. Whilst fighting, he used a combination of balance and upper-body strength while taking his time trying to control his opponents before landing punches. Although left-handed by nature, he became adept at using either hand during fights. During his career in the NHL, Brashear was considered one of the toughest players in the League as well as one most feared.

In the January 2010 issue of &quot;The Hockey News&quot;, Brashear was named Enforcer of the Decade, noting that although he did not lead the NHL in number of fights, during the decade, he would have been involved in more if &quot;he wasn&#x27;t so feared.&quot; Hockey analyst Bill Clement states that &quot;Brashear has a great sense of when his fighting skills are necessary and he picks his spots before dropping the gloves. He&#x27;s excellent at understanding when a bit of pugilism might well provide the push or nudge to get some momentum going for his team.&quot; &quot;The Hockey News&quot; also assessed his skills by saying he possessed one of the most intimidating packages in the League, had a decent skating stride, and was one of the best pugilists in the NHL. He was a bit too deliberate when handling and passing the puck, and fought much less as he got older, while slowly breaking down over time.

== Mixed martial arts ==
In April 2011, Brashear signed a three-fight contract with the mixed martial arts promoter Ringside MMA. Brashear&#x27;s first fight occurred on June 4, 2011, against Mathieu Bergeron at the Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City. In the fight, Brashear immediately charged Bergeron, knocking him down with a right hook. After knocking him down, he continued to hit him with hammer fists, forcing the referee to stop the fight after only 21 seconds. Brashear was officially awarded the win by TKO.

==Personal life==
Brashear has two sons, Jordan and Jaxxon. He separated from their mother, Gabrielle Desgagne, his common-law wife, in 2007. Aside from a half-brother, he does not speak to his birth family. He credits the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father as a child for this. Jaxxon Brashear has played football with the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees since 2022.

In 2000, Brashear was charged with assault following an altercation with a neighbour in the weight room of their townhouse complex in Vancouver. According to court documents, Brashear grabbed the neighbor around the throat and pushed him after the man had complained about Brashear&#x27;s infant son Jordan crawling on the exercise equipment. &quot;That&#x27;s no way to show my boys how to solve their problems&quot;, Brashear said after the guilty verdict, also lamenting the fact that he had trouble controlling a violent temper inherited from his father. He would ultimately receive six months probation after pleading guilty to common assault and granted a conditional discharge.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Brashear spent time as an amateur boxer, compiling a 2–1 record. Later on, he trained with former heavyweight champion Smokin&#x27; Joe Frazier In 2007, Brashear, along with some friends, founded the house building company DEC Construction. During the off-season, he works on-site performing various jobs. He has a skill for languages, speaking French and English, while also learning both Russian and Spanish. He enjoys music as well, playing the piano while learning the acoustic guitar.
In 2012, Brashear was convicted of assault for a second time after an altercation in a parking lot following a March 2011, Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey playoff game. He was sentenced to 18 months probation and was sued for over $200,000 in damages by the victim in 2014.

Brashear&#x27;s great-uncle Carl Brashear was the first African-American to be certified as a Master Diver in the United States Navy; he was the inspiration for the movie &quot;Men of Honor&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor Cuba Gooding, Jr.

On June 5, 2019, Brashear had another brush with the law when he was arrested for allegedly breaking an apartment window. Police subsequently discovered cocaine in his possession. Brashear made a court appearance on August 12, 2019, and was scheduled to return to court in Quebec City on September 4 to face the cocaine possession charge.

In October 2019, it was reported that Brashear was working at a Tim Hortons restaurant in Quebec City owned by Pierre Sévigny.

<text>Braidwood is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, in Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council. It is located on the Kings Highway linking Canberra with Batemans Bay. It is approximately 200 kilometres south west of Sydney, 60 kilometres inland from the coast, and 55 kilometres east of Canberra. Braidwood is a service town for the surrounding district which is based on sheep and cattle grazing, and forestry operations.

== Indigenous History ==

Braidwood is located within the Yuin Nation, on Walbanga Country. The Walbanga People speak dialects of the Thurga (Durga/Dhurga) language.

The Walbanga Peoples relied on the plentiful supply of vegetables available in the tablelands, such as the tubers of the yam daisy, wattle-seeds, and orchid tubers. In September to May, fish and crayfish were eaten, while possums and larger grazing animals were hunted year round. The Walbanga People and neighbouring groups made annual trips in December and January from to the Bogong Mountains and Snowy Mountains to roast and eat bogong moths (Agrotis infusa).

The lives of the Walbanga People were forever changed by the arrival and early colonisation of Europeans in the 1820s. There were reports of the loss of water, fish and native animals essential to the First Nations&#x27;s diet after the arrival of the settlers. The settlers also brought exotic diseases, particularly smallpox, the influenza epidemic in 1846-7 and syphilis, which devastated the First Nation&#x27;s people in the region, likely including the Walbanga People. The Walbanga and surrounding populations culture and traditional life was considered to have been destroyed by 1850. Bogong moth ceremonies, intertribal meetings and corroborees also ceased in the region.

In 1872, First Nation&#x27;s Peoples from the south coast and the highlands areas met in a large ceremonial gathering on the Braidwood goldfields, where they also held discussions about strategies to gain back access to their land. After the gathering, the local police officer, Martin Brennan, was approached by 62 members of the gathering, led by &#x27;Jack Bawn and Alick&#x27; who asked for his assistance, and Brennan recorded the following: &quot;I asked Jack what they wanted. He replied, &#x27;We have come to you to intercede for us in getting the Government to do something for us... I have assisted the police for many years, and we want to get some land which we can call our own in reality, where we can settle down, and which the old people can call their home.&#x27;...&quot;

On 29 March 1873, Brennan sent the government a comprehensive report detailing the experiences, circumstances and the aspirations of the group. Shortly afterwards he received instructions to name forty acres of Crown Lands in whatever location Jack Bawn desired as an Aboriginal Reserve. However, Jack Bawn and his people were blocked from occupying the surveyed land due to the hostility from surrounding white farmers, but they continued to urge Brennan to press Authorities for the land. Brennan also recorded the following statement in regards to the First Nation&#x27;s Peoples of the Braidwood and Coast Districts &quot;...whose aspirations at all times were to be allowed some land which they might call their own...; which they might cultivate unmolested for the use of themselves and their families; and where the aborigines of the surrounding districts might meet periodically for the purpose of holding coroborees and other exhilarating games.&quot;

As of the 2016 Census, there were less than 100 First Nations&#x27; Australians living in the Braidwood Region.

== Settler History ==

European explorers reached the district in 1822 (Kearns, Marsh and Packer). The area was first settled by Europeans in the 1820s, and the town was surveyed in 1839. The village was located near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River. The settlement was built with the labour of convicts, and many of the buildings they built around the region are still standing.

Most streets in the town are named after early settlers of the surrounding district; Elrington, Coghill, Duncan, Mackellar, Ryrie, Wallace, and Wilson. Ryrie Park is named after Alexander Ryrie.

===Dr Wilson===
The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. 
He had been a surgeon-superintendent of ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first granted land in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1824, which he exchanged for land near Lake George in 1825. In addition he was given 2560 acres (10 km2) which he selected in the &#x27;new country&#x27; on two tributaries of the Shoalhaven, Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833, the western end of Wilson&#x27;s grant was resumed and reserved for a future village and a similar area added to the eastern end in compensation. He eventually controlled a total of 12,305 acres in the area. He and his wife and children settled in the district in late 1836. He became a community leader and amongst other things contracted to build the first courthouse in 1837–38. In 1840 Wilson petitioned the government to build a road from Braidwood to Jervis Bay to enable faster and cheaper shipping of the wool clip to Sydney and, with Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and labour for the Braidwood to Nerriga section.

In 1841 Braidwood Farm had 141 residents. Wilson was sent bankrupt due to a drought in the late 1830s and the subsequent depression. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned all the land on the south, east and north of the town. Coghill built the historic house Bedervale. However, before his death, Wilson had purchased the block immediately to the north of Braidwood. He was buried on this block, high on the hill overlooking the town.

A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson&#x27;s grave, from which there are views of the town. The path to the grave is no longer open to the public.

===First Royal Commission===
Braidwood was the subject of Australia&#x27;s first Royal Commission in 1867, inquiring into the activities of police officers and managers in the district, concerning the extent to which bushrangers had been shielded and assisted by police connivance and inactivity. The Commission identified several instances of misconduct and found the superintendent of police had failed to exercise &#x27;strict and proper control over his men.&#x27;

===Gold discovered===
Gold was discovered in 1851, and for the next two decades the district&#x27;s population swelled to about 10,000. Supplies and produce to support the workforce on the gold fields came from as far afield as the Canberra region, (though Canberra itself would not be founded until 1913). This prosperity lasted for several years, during which some substantial commercial buildings including banks and hotels were constructed.

===Twentieth century===
Braidwood was formerly the seat of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following restructuring of local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. The local paper is now called the &quot;Braidwood Times&quot;.

Through much of the 20th century, Braidwood was essentially in rural recession. Amongst other consequences, very little building work was carried out, and as a result the town entered the 21st century with much of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, following a period of unpleasant dispute between those wishing to preserve the town&#x27;s charm and those wishing to develop it.

Braidwood is located equidistant from Bungendore and Tarago railway stations, a distance of approximately 40 kilometres. NSW TrainLink operate multiple direct services from both railways stations to Canberra, Sydney, and provides connections across the state. Murray&#x27;s coach services operate daily between Bateman&#x27;s Bay and Canberra including picking up and setting down passengers in Braidwood.

== Heritage listings ==

Braidwood has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Braidwood and Its Setting
* Monkitee Street: Bedervale
* Wallace Street: Braidwood District Historical Society Museum
* Wallace Street: Mill Complex
* 119 Wallace Street: Albion Hotel

==Climate==
Braidwood has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild to warm summers and cold winters with frequent morning frost. Due to its position on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range and its proximity to the Tasman Sea, summer temperatures are generally cooler than in nearby Bungendore and Goulburn which lie further inland at a similar altitude. Braidwood&#x27;s greater exposure to moist easterly winds also yields a wetter climate relative to Bungendore and Goulburn. Warm to hot summer days are usually tempered by afternoon and evening easterly breezes.
==Population==
At the , Braidwood had a population of 1,720. 78.0% of people were born in Australia and 85.9% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.5%, Catholic 21.0% and Anglican 16.6%.

== Media ==
Braidwood is served by local newspaper, the Braidwood Times, which is owned by Australian Community Media.

Braidwood is home to community radio station 2BRW. Operating under the name &#x27;Braidwood Community Radio&#x27;, the station can be heard on 88.9 FM. For commercial radio, Braidwood is in the Goulburn broadcast licence area with 2GN heard on 1368 AM and Eagle FM on 93.5 FM. These stations have studios in Goulburn.

The town falls under the Southern NSW television licence area with stations transmitting from a tower on Mount Gillamatong, adjacent to the township.

==In popular culture==

===Film and television===
The town has several times been used for film locations, including &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (1920), &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (1970), &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot; (1987), &quot;On our Selection&quot; (1995), &quot;Finding Joy&quot; (2003), &quot;The Discontinuity&quot; (2009) and &quot;Australia&#x27;s Most Haunted&quot; (2013).

<doc id="718908" wikidata="Q2354079" url="?curid=718908" title="M-96 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-96 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs between Kalamazoo and Marshall. Its termini are both on business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94); the eastern one coincides with an intersection with I-69. Between Kalamazoo and Marshall it passes through Comstock, Galesburg, Augusta, and Battle Creek intersecting I-194/M-66 in Battle Creek and I-94 in Emmett Township.

The highway now known as M-96 was originally part of M-17. Parts of M-17 that were not used for US Highway 12 (US 12) in 1926 were given the M-96 number. Additional segments of trunkline were added to M-96, one of which was an Alternate US 12 in the years afterwards. Later, US 12 was moved after the completion of I-94 in southern Michigan. Additional US 12 segments were added to M-96 at that time. The last major changes to M-96 rerouted the highway through the Battle Creek area in late 1998.

==Route description==
M-96 starts at an intersection between King Highway and Business Spur I-94 (BS I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock and north of Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, skirting the Fort Custer State Recreation Area and the Fort Custer National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads.

On the north side of the airport, M-96 runs concurrently with both Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) and M-37. M-96 turns south on Helmer Road, separating from the other two trunklines, and then turns east crossing along Columbia Avenue. Here the highway runs along the edge of the city of Battle Creek through more residential areas and crosses the I-194/M-66 freeway next to the Riverside County Club. Near Brownlee Park, M-96 (Columbia Avenue) merges with BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). Together BL I-94/M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue to I-94 where BL I-94 ends. M-96 passes the FireKeepers Casino Hotel, which is located just east of the ending of BL I-94, between 11 and 12 Mile Roads. M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue through farmland from Emmett to Marshall ending at an interchange with I-69/BL I-94.

M-96 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-96 were the 22,953 vehicles daily between Capitol Avenue and I-194 in Battle Creek; the lowest counts were the 5,167 vehicles per day at the western terminus in Kalamazoo. The only section of M-96 that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS), is in the Battle Creek area between the western BL I-94/M-37 junction and the I-94 interchange. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
M-96 was formed as a state trunkline in late 1926 from parts of M-17. The section of M-17 between Galesberg and Battle Creek was not utilized for US 12 and became M-96. In 1936, the Alternate US 12 trunkline was designated through the Battle Creek area along a section of highway that had previously been part of US 12. This highway was added to M-96 three years later in 1939.

A rerouting of trunklines in 1941 lead to the creation of a Business US 12 (Bus. US 12). M-96 ran concurrently with Bus. US 12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US 12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US 12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and Bus. US 12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed in the area. Bus. US 12 was redesignated as BL I-94 in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961.

M-89 was extended along the roadway used by M-96 west of Battle Creek to M-37 in 1965, truncating M-96 in the process. M-96 was reextended back to Battle Creek along Dickman Road and Fort Custer Highway from Augusta east in 1971. Several changes in Battle Creek were made to the area trunklines in 1998. M-96 was extended along BL I-94 (Dickman Road) to M-37 (Helmer Road) and along M-37 to Columbia Avenue. At Columbia, M-96 then turned west and M-37 turned east. M-96 rejoined BL I-94 along Michigan Avenue to I-94 and on to Marshall.

<doc id="718913" wikidata="Q823277" url="?curid=718913" title="Shoalhaven River">
<text>The Shoalhaven River is a perennial river that rises from the Southern Tablelands and flows into an open mature wave dominated barrier estuary near Nowra on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia.

==Location and features==

The Shoalhaven River rises on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range, below Euranbene Mountain, about southwest of Sydney. The upper reaches of the river flow northwards through an upland pastoral district near the town of Braidwood. The river works its way down into a remote canyon east of Goulburn and emerges into the coastal lowlands at Nowra in the Shoalhaven district, where it is spanned by the Nowra Bridge. The river is joined by thirty-four tributaries, including the Mongarlowe, Corang, Endrick, and Kangaroo rivers, and descends over its course.

=== Berrys Canal ===

The estuary has two entrances, approximately apart, that flow into the Shoalhaven Bight within the Tasman Sea of the Pacific Ocean. The southern entrance is located at Crookhaven Heads and is permanently open. The Shoalhaven River flows south via Berrys Canal to Greenwell Point, where it is joined by the Crookhaven River and then flows east past Orient Point into the bight, north of Culburra. The Berrys Canal between the Shoalhaven and the Crookhaven was constructed in June 1822 by convicts overseen by Hamilton Hume under the direction of Alexander Berry to facilitate ship transport to the original European settlement located in the region. The construction of the canal formed Comerong Island. The canal was dug using own hand tools, and was the first land navigable canal in Australia. Berrys Canal remains one of two navigable canals in New South Wales, the other being the Alexandra Canal.

The northern entrance is located south of Shoalhaven Heads, and is open intermittently, at times of peak flow and during flood events.

=== Use for water supply ===

Tallowa Dam is the only major dam on the Shoalhaven, and is a part of the Shoalhaven Scheme. It impounds the river&#x27;s lower reaches to form Lake Yarrunga and part of Sydney&#x27;s water supply. Some water is pumped out of the lake and over the Southern Highlands into Lake Burragorang. Proposals for a much larger water storage at Welcome Reef on the upper Shoalhaven have been shelved.

=== Environment ===

The Shoalhaven River and its main tributary the Kangaroo River were once renowned as an Australian bass fishery. Unfortunately, Tallowa Dam has been a potent barrier to migratory native fish with estuarine/marine juvenile stages, blocking species including Australian bass from more than 80% of their former range in the Shoalhaven system. Recent stockings of hatchery-bred Bass in Lake Yarrunga are an attempt to remediate the situation. A fishway for Tallowa Dam was completed in August 2009. This fishway is designed to allow for the movement of bass and other native fish over the dam. Lake Yarrunga has also suffered the illegal introduction of highly damaging European carp, which are now present in high densities.

== History ==

===Indigenous history===
The traditional custodians of the land are Jerrinja tribal peoples the surrounding Shoalhaven River, in its lower reaches, are the Aboriginal peoples of the lower catchment are Jerrinja tribal peoples which are the traditional custodians of the Shoalhaven . Some of the culturally important Aboriginal places in the Shoalhaven include Coolangatta Mountain, Bundarwa (Beecroft Headland), Cambewarra Mountain, &quot;Didthul&quot; or Pigeon House Mountain, Kangaroo Valley, Burrill Lake, and Murramarang Aboriginal Area and its environs.

The upper part of the Shoalhaven river, in the district around modern-day Braidwood, is the traditional land of Walbanga people.

===European history===
The explorer and navigator George Bass found the entrance to the Shoalhaven River during his whaleboat voyage down the south coast of New South Wales in 1797. He gave the name Shoals Haven to the river (now known as the Crookhaven River) because of the shoals of mud and sand he found at the river mouth.

Approximately west of Nowra are a series of properties along the banks of the Shoalhaven River that were a gift to the people of Australia from Arthur Boyd, his wife, Yvonne, and the Boyd family. Entrusted to the Bundanon Trust, along with further gifts by Boyd, including copyright of all of his artwork, these properties provide an environment that promotes visual arts, writing, music and other performing arts, and the promotion of education and research in the arts.

==Crossings==



The river crossings, from its headwaters to its river mouth, include:

* Ballalaba bridge
* Farringdon crossing between Farringdon and Bendoura
* Bombay bridge
* Warri Bridge carries the Kings Highway, near Braidwood. A bridge at this location was first opened on 23 September 1874, and later replaced by the current structure.
* Stewart&#x27;s Crossing is a ford on Stewart&#x27;s Crossing Road.
* Oallen Crossing was formerly a flood-prone single-lane timber bridge with a low-level concrete floodway for the Oallen Ford Road at Oallen Ford, near Nerriga, constructed in 1936. The timber bridge and floodway has been replaced by a longer higher concrete bridge crossing slightly downstream, around mid-2015 (date needs checking). . The new crossing is designed to permit higher speed travel and eliminates some sharp bends on the western side of the river and only to be overtopped by much deeper 1:20-year flood events.
* Nowra Bridge carries the Princes Highway between Bomaderry and Nowra.
* Comerong Island Ferry carries vehicles and pedestrians to Comerong Island near the river mouth.
Historically, there was once a ford crossing at the former village of Larbert.

<text>Kasetsart University (; ; commonly Kaset or KU) is a public research university in Bangkok, Thailand. It is the largest university in Thailand. It was Thailand&#x27;s first agricultural university and Thailand&#x27;s third oldest university. It was established on 2 February 1943 to promote subjects related to agricultural science. Since then, Kasetsart University has expanded its subject areas to cover life sciences, science, engineering, social sciences, and humanities. Kasetsart University&#x27;s main campus is in Bangkhen, northern Bangkok, with several other campuses throughout Thailand.

== History ==

In 1902, King Chulalongkorn attempted to promote the country&#x27;s silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama, from the University of Tokyo, to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts. In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at Tambon Thung Saladaeng, Bangkok by Prince Benbadhanabongse, the director of the department of sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture. The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.

In 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at Windsor Palace as the Ministry of Agriculture merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand&#x27;s first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909. However, the Siamese government merged the School of the Ministry of Agriculture with the Civil Service College in 1913, due to the objective of founding the school meets the royal initiative of establishment the Civil Service College of King Vajiravudh.

In 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in Tambon Horwang. It moved to Tambon Phra Prathon, Nakhon Pathom Province in 1918.

In 1931, Prince Sithiporn Kridakara and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in Saraburi Province, in the northern region in Chiang Mai Province, in the northeastern region in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, and in the southern region in Songkhla Province.

In 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today&#x27;s Mae Jo University) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.

The Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or &quot;Kaset Klang&quot;, in Bang Khen District, Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became Kasetsart Preparatory School to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.

In 1943, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture. The university initially consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today&#x27;s divided into Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).

In 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan. The Kamphaeng Saen campus was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.

The university further expanded by establishing Sriracha campus, Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus, Suphan Buri campus, Krabi campus and Lopburi campus. The university already established Si Racha campus in 1989 and the Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus on 15 August 1996.

On 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a public university to a national university.

<text>The Tweed River is a river situated in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. From the middle reaches of its course, the state boundary between New South Wales and Queensland is located approximately north.

The river rises on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range; with its watershed bordered by the McPherson, Burringbar, Condong and Tweed ranges and containing a catchment area of . The river flows generally north east, joined by eight tributaries including the Oxley and Rous rivers before reaching its mouth at its confluence with the Coral Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, south of Point Danger; descending over its course.

On its journey, it passes through the major urban centres of Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads.

The river&#x27;s drainage basin consists mostly of the erosion caldera of the Tweed Volcano, a huge extinct volcano of which Mount Warning is the volcanic plug. The Tweed River area has a fine subtropical climate, high rainfall and fertile volcanic soils. It was originally covered by rainforest, much of which has been cleared. Some remains in several national parks and reserves. The lowlands along the river are used for farming sugar cane and other crops.

The surrounding Tweed Shire is a local government area of New South Wales. Each year the river hosts a number of major aquatic events. The lower reaches of the Tweed River are a good recreational fishing site. Waterskiing, pleasure boating and rowing are other popular activities on the lower reaches of the river.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Tweed River are the Aboriginal people of the Minyungbul, Tulgi-gin, Cudgenburra, and Mooburra dialects. Yugembah (also known as Yugumbir, Jugambel, Jugambeir, Jugumbir, Jukam, Jukamba) is one of the Australian Aboriginal languages in areas that include the Tweed River Valley, Gold Coast, Logan, Scenic Rim, Albert River, Beaudesert, Beenleigh, Coolangatta, Coomera, Logan River, Pimpama and Tamborine, within the local government boundaries of the City of Gold Coast, City of Logan, Scenic Rim Regional Council and the Tweed River Valley.

===European discovery and naming===
The first European explorer to see the river was John Oxley, in 1823. As Surveyor General, Oxley made a close examination of the Tweed River and Port Curtis, and sources connected that investigation, principally the manuscript journal kept by Oxley, and the published &quot;Narrative&quot; of John Uniaeke, who accompanied Oxley. The following is an extract from Oxley&#x27;s notebook entry for 31 October 1823:
Fri.31 October
At 3[PM] made sail intending to anchor to the South of Point Danger. At 5[PM] passed close to a Bold Headland [present-day Point Danger] about 3 Miles North of Pt. D. [Cook&#x27;s Point Danger - Fingal Head] On the South Side of this headland we had the satisfaction to discover a considerable river with an apparent clear entrance. Hove on for the purpose of anchoring between the Island and the Main land [Fingal Head]. At ½ past 5 passing too close to the Island we shoaled our &quot;water to 2 ½ fms but almost instantly deepened to 5 fms. Anchored under the lee of the Island in 7 fms sandy Bottom being tolerably sheltered from the SSE round by the w to NE - the distance between the Island and the Main is about 50 chains, the point of the Main as well as the Island composed of regular Basaltic Pillars.
To the South extends a Sandy Beach of about 3 ½ miles ending in a low sandy Point off which brakers seem to extend about ¾ of a mile. Soundings between the Island and the Main and found the deepest water 6 fms in mid channel rather including to the Mainland.
Observed the River from the Mast head take a SW direction running through a moderately elevated country towards the Base of Mt. Warning.
John Uniack made the following relevant observations.
Monday 27 October 1823: The wind being fair, we immediately got under way, and continued our course to the northward till Friday afternoon, when it shifted, and came on to blow so hard, that we determined to run in shore and look out for anchorage; this we found under the lee of a small island off Point Danger (so named by Captain Cook), about a mile from the land. While running down for this place, we perceived the mouth of a large river about a mile and a half to the northward; and next morning at daylight the master was dispatched in the whale-boat to ascertain the possibility of taking the vessel into it.
Shortly afterwards, Mr. Stirling and I landed on the island with our guns. The rocks which formed the base was evidently of volcanic origin: it was of dark colour, full of small holes and extremely hard, while on the western side many regular circular cavities, some of which were about four or five yards in diameter at top, and tapered down gradually towards the bottom, which was usually filled with round stones.
One of these holes, in particular, had a communication underneath with the sea, and at every returning surf threw up considerable quantities of water with a loud noise. The superincumbent rocks were basaltic, and those of a small rock to the N.W. of the island, as well as those of a bluff headland, immediately opposite on the main, were inferior only in extent to the Giant’s Causeway in the north of Ireland.

John Uniack also noted: 
&quot;The little island under which we lay received the name of Turtle Island, in gratitude for the abundant supply of that fish which we procured from it. We also gave the name of &#x27;Tweed&#x27; to the river. The latitude of our anchorage is 28° 8&#x27; S. and its longitude 153° 31&#x27;&quot;

Captain Phillip Parker King had previously surveyed that portion of the coast in the proximity of Point Danger, although adverse weather conditions prevented his examining that portion too closely. His observations, as recorded on 22 and 23 May 1819, are as follows:
22. The next evening, Mount Warning was seen from the deck, although we were at least seventy-eight miles from it. 23 on the 23d at noon, our latitude was 28°9&#x27; when the Mount bore S 58° W (Magnetic).
At sunset the wind died away; and, from the land in the vicinity of the mountain indicating every appearance of the existence of either a large sheet of water or an opening of consequence, I was induced to remain two days to examine the beach more narrowly; but, after beating about with a strong south-easterly current which prevented my tracing the beach to the northward of the Mount, and having only seen an inconsiderable opening that communicates by a shoal channel with a small lagoon at the back of the beach, I gave up the search; still without satisfying myself of the non-existence of an inlet, which, if there be one, probably communicates with the sea nearer to Point Danger.
Lieut Oxley has since (1823) discovered this to be the case, for he found a stream empting itself into the sea, by a bar harbour close to Point Danger. Lieutenant Oxley called it the Tweed.

In the Appendix to the second volume of that work, containing a description of the ports, islands and coast between Port Jackson and Breakesea Spit, the following description of the Tweed River confirms that Captain King clearly considered Point Danger to be the southernmost of the two points:

The Tweed is a river communicating with the sea by a bar, on which there is twelve feet of water, it is situated about a mile and a half to the north of a small island off Point Danger, which lies in latitude 28° 8&#x27;

Captain Henry Rous further examined the Tweed River in 1828, and incorrectly identified the present-day Point Danger, as the Point Danger of James Cook and recorded the name &#x27;Cook&#x27;s Island&#x27; rather than &#x27;Turtle Island&#x27; of Oxley [Rous named Oxley&#x27;s Tweed the Clarance River]:

The River Clarance, or more properly the Tweed, discovered by Mr. Oxley, but not explored, is in lat. 28° 9&#x27;, long. 153° 34&#x27; bearing N.W.½ W. from Turtle Island distant 2 ½ miles – it is situated to the southward of a Bluff Head, connected with the Main by a flat sandy Isthmus, 250 yards wide from high water mark forming a boundary to the river on one side, and to capacious bay to the northward – affording good anchorage and shelter from East Southerly to North….There is a small river about 10 miles NW by W from the *north bluff of Point Danger inaccessible for boats.

The Tweed was named after the River Tweed in Scotland.

===Mouth stabilization===
The first training walls were built in 1891. Between 1898 and 1904, training walls were constructed from Chinderah to the entrance. In 1962, these walls were extended in order to maintain a deep channel. The order failed to stop the channel from shoaling and instead necessitated regular dredging and completely inhibited the longshore transport of sand northwards. The southern Gold Coast beaches were soon faced with intense erosion during storms which was not replenished.

By 1998 the river entrance was dredged clear of sand for navigable purposes. Three million cubic metres of sand had been removed from the river mouth. In 2001, an artificial sand bypass system was implemented, in part based on the successful operation of the Gold Coast Seaway. The level of sand on southern Gold Coast beaches soon returned to pre-1960s levels.

====Colloquial use====
Even though parts of the river are a few kilometres within the New South Wales side of the border, the expression &quot;North of the Tweed&quot; is used to refer to the people and places of Queensland; likewise, &quot;South of the Tweed&quot; is a term used by Queenslanders regarding the southern states of Australia. The term probably originates from southern Australians&#x27; summer vacation trips driving along the Pacific Highway through the scenic New South Wales North Coast. The highway crosses many rivers along its route, with the Tweed being the last one before reaching the holiday destinations of the Gold Coast, just on the other side of the Queensland border.

==Course==
The river begins northwest of the village called Lillian Rock. The upper reaches pass through the small villages of Kunghur, Terragon and Uki. South of Mount Warning, Doon Doon Creek and Perch Creek enter the Tweed from its southern banks, and Byrill Creek joins on the northern side near Terragon. Downstream, Korumbyn Creek and then the Oxley River enters the river at Byangum, before it flows through Murwillumbah. At Tumbulgum, the Rous River joins the Tweed. The Terranora and Cobaki creeks enter the Tweed about upstream from the mouth. South of Banora Point, the Pacific Highway crosses the river.

The river&#x27;s tidal influence reaches beyond Murwillumbah to Bray Park Weir. The estuary of the Tweed River is an important shorebird habitat. Grey mangroves are the predominant mangrove species along the Tweed River.

===Flooding===

During Cyclone Oswald, the Tweed River was subject to major flooding, brought about due to the storm&#x27;s residual effects and associated monsoon trough that passed over parts of Queensland and New South Wales. The river peaked at , the highest level recorded in 30 years.

In late March 2017 rainfall from Ex-Tropical Cyclone Debbie caused major flooding in the Tweed Valley, the Murwillumbah gauge recording a peak of 6.2 metres.

===Mouth===
There is a sand bypassing system operating at the mouth of the Tweed River. A jetty on the northern end of Letitia Spit that collects sand and then pumps it under the Tweed River to beaches in the neighbouring state of Queensland. Outlets for the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing System include Duranbah Beach, Snapper Rocks East, Snapper Rocks West, Greenmount and Kirra. Dredging of the navigation entrance is also undertaken regularly as part of the overall sand bypassing program. The width of the Tweed River mouth is about .

The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin reaches its southern extent of its distribution at the river mouth.

<doc id="718929" wikidata="Q649263" url="?curid=718929" title="Papal primacy">
<text>Papal primacy, also known as the primacy of the bishop of Rome, is an ecclesiological doctrine in the Catholic Church concerning the respect and authority that is due to the pope from other bishops and their episcopal sees. While the doctrine is accepted at a fundamental level by both the Catholic Church (Eastern and Western) and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the two disagree on the nature of primacy.

English academic and Catholic priest Aidan Nichols wrote that &quot;at root, only one issue of substance divides the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Churches, and that is the issue of the primacy.&quot; French Eastern Orthodox researcher Jean-Claude Larchet wrote that, together with the &quot;Filioque&quot; controversy, differences in interpretation of this doctrine have been and remain the primary causes of schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Eastern Orthodox churches, some understand the primacy of the bishop of Rome to be merely one of greater honour, regarding him as &quot;&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;), without effective power over other churches. A prominent 20th century Eastern Orthodox Christian theologian, Fr. Alexander Schmemann, envisioned a primacy that sums up rather than rules over: &quot;Primacy &quot;is&quot; power, but as power it is not different from the power of a bishop in each church. It is not a &quot;higher power&quot; but indeed the same power, only expressed, manifested, and realized by one.&quot;

The Catholic Church attributes to the primacy of the pope &quot;full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered,&quot; a power that it attributes also to the entire body of the bishops united with the pope. The power that it attributes to the pope&#x27;s primatial authority has limitations that are official, legal, dogmatic, and practical.

In the Ravenna Document, issued in 2007, representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church jointly stated that both accept the bishop of Rome&#x27;s primacy at the universal level, but that differences of understanding exist about how the primacy is to be exercised and about its scriptural and theological foundations.
==Dogma within Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches==
The Catholic dogma of the primacy of the bishop of Rome is codified in both codes of canon law of the Catholic Church – the Latin Church&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; (1983 CIC) and the Eastern Catholic Churches&#x27; 1990 &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; (CCEO). The Second Vatican Council&#x27;s 1964 dogmatic constitution &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; (LG) declared that the &quot;pope&#x27;s power of primacy&quot; is by &quot;virtue of his office, that is as Vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Church&quot;, and is &quot;full, supreme and universal power over the Church&quot; which he &quot;is always free to exercise&quot;. The primacy of the bishop of Rome, according to John Hardon in &quot;Catholic Dictionary&quot;, is &quot;primacy of jurisdiction, which means the possession of full and supreme teaching, legislative, and sacerdotal powers in the Catholic Church&quot;; it is authority &quot;not only in faith and morals but Church discipline and in the government of the Church.&quot;

In canon 331, the &quot;bishop of the Roman Church&quot; is both the &quot;vicar of Christ&quot; and &quot;pastor of the universal Church on earth&quot;. Knut Walf, in &quot;New commentary on the Code of Canon Law&quot;, notes that this description, &quot;bishop of the Roman Church&quot;, is only found in this canon, and the term &quot;Roman pontiff&quot; is generally used in . Ernest Caparros &quot;et al&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Code of Canon Law Annotated&quot; comments that this canon pertains to all individuals and groups of faithful within the Latin Church, of all rites and hierarchical ranks, &quot;not only in matters of faith and morals but also in all that concerns the discipline and government of the Church throughout the whole world&quot;. Heinrich Denzinger, Peter Hünermann, et al. &quot;Enchiridion symbolorum&quot; (DH) states that Christ did not form the Church as several distinct communities, but unified through full communion with the bishop of Rome and profession of the same faith with the bishop of Rome.

The bishop of Rome is a subject of supreme authority over the &quot;sui iuris&quot; Eastern Catholic Churches. In canon 45, the bishop of Rome has &quot;by virtue of his office&quot; both &quot;power over the entire Church&quot; and &quot;primacy of ordinary power over all the eparchies and groupings of them&quot; within each of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Through the office &quot;of the supreme pastor of the Church,&quot; he is in communion with the other bishops and with the entire Church, and has the right to determines whether to exercise this authority either personally or collegially. This &quot;primacy over the entire Church&quot; includes primacy over Eastern Catholic patriarchs and eparchial bishops, over governance of institutes of consecrated life, and over judicial affairs.

Primacy of the bishop of Rome was also codified in the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; (1917 CIC) canons 218–221.

==Development of the doctrine==
The Catholic Church bases its doctrine of papal primacy on the primacy among the apostles that Jesus gave to Peter in : and in : &quot;Feed my lambs [...] Feed my sheep.&quot;

While acknowledging that &quot;the New Testament contains no explicit record of a transmission of Peter&#x27;s leadership; nor is the transmission of apostolic authority in general very clear,&quot; it considers that its doctrine has a developmental history and that its teaching about matters such as the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the union of his two natures in a single person developed as the result of drawing out from the original revealed truth consequences that were not obvious at first: &quot;Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow in the life of the Church &#x27;through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts&#x27;; it is in particular &#x27;theological research [which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth.&#x27;&quot;

Accordingly, it would be a mistake to expect to find the modern fully developed doctrine of papal primacy in the first centuries, thereby failing to recognize the Church&#x27;s historical reality. The figure of the pope as leader of the worldwide church developed over time, as the figure of the bishop as leader of the local church seems to have appeared later than in the time of the apostles.

That the Christian scriptures, which contain no cut-and-dried answers to questions such as whether or not there is forgiveness for post-baptismal sins, and whether or not infants should be baptized, gradually become clearer in the light of events, is a view expressed, when considering the doctrine of papal primacy, by Cardinal John Henry Newman, who summed up his thought by saying:

Modern Eastern Orthodox writers such as Nikolay Afanásiev and Alexander Schmemann have written that the phrase &quot;presiding in &quot;agape&quot;&quot;, used of the Church of Rome in the letter that Ignatius of Antioch addressed to it in the early 2nd century, contains a definition of that Church&#x27;s universal primacy; but the Catholic writer Klaus Schatz warns that it would be wrong to read this letter and the even earlier First Epistle of Clement (the name of Clement was added only later), in which the Church of Rome intervenes in matters of the Church of Corinth, admonishing it in authoritative tones, even speaking in the name of God, as statements of the developed Catholic teaching on papal primacy. It was only later that the expression of Ignatius of Antioch could be interpreted as meaning, as agreed by representatives of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, that &quot;Rome, as the Church that &#x27;presides in love&#x27; according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch (&quot;To the Romans&quot;, Prologue), occupied the first place in the &quot;taxis&quot; [lit. &#x27;arrangement, order&#x27;)], and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the &quot;protos&quot; [lit. &#x27;first&#x27;)] among the patriarchs&quot;.

The same agreement stated:
===Basis of claims to primacy===

====Peter and Paul====
The evolution of earlier tradition established both Peter and Paul as the forefathers of the bishops of Rome, from whom they received their position as chief shepherd (Peter) and supreme authority on doctrine (Paul). To establish her primacy among the churches of the Western half of the empire, the bishops of Rome relied on a letter written in 416 by Innocent I to the Bishop of Gubbio, to show how subordination to Rome had been established. Since Peter was the only apostle (no mention of Paul) to have worked in the West, thus the only persons to have established churches in Italy, Spain, Gaul, Sicily, Africa, and the Western islands were bishops appointed by Peter or his successors. This being the case then, all congregations had to abide by the regulations set in Rome.

=====Primacy of Peter the apostle=====

Because of its association with the supposed position of Peter among the apostles, the function that, within the Catholic Church, is exercised by the Bishop of Rome among the bishops as a whole is referred to as the Petrine function, and is generally believed to be of divine institution, in the sense that the historical and sociological factors that influenced its development are seen as guided by the Holy Spirit. Not all Catholic theologians see a special providential intervention as responsible for the result, but most see the papacy, regardless of its origin, as now essential to the Church&#x27;s structure.

The presence of Peter in Rome, not explicitly affirmed in, but consistent with, the New Testament, is explicitly affirmed by Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon and other early Christian writers – and no other place has ever claimed to be the location of his death. The same witnesses imply that Peter was the virtual founder of the Church of Rome, though not its founder in the sense of initiating a Christian community there. They also speak of Peter as the one who initiated its episcopal succession, but speak of Linus as the first bishop of Rome after Peter, although some hold today that the Christians in Rome did not act as a single united community under a single leader until the 2nd century.

=====Role of Paul in the founding of the Church of Rome=====
Irenaeus of Lyon (AD 189) wrote that Peter and Paul had founded the Church in Rome and had appointed Pope Linus to the office of the episcopate, the beginning of the succession of the Roman see. Although the introduction of Christianity was not due to them, &quot;the arrival, ministries and especially the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul were the seminal events which really constituted the Church of Rome. It was from their time, and not before, that an orderly and meetly ordained succession of Bishops originated.&quot;

==Historical development==

While the doctrine of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, in the form in which it is upheld today in the Catholic Church, developed over the course of centuries, often in reaction to challenges made against exercises of authority by popes, writers both of East and West declare that from a very early period the Church of Rome was looked to as the centre of reference for the whole Church. Thus Schmemann wrote:
In their &quot;The See of Peter&quot; (1927), non-Catholic academic historians James T. Shotwell and Louise Ropes Loomis, noted the following:

===Pope as arbiter===
Eastern Orthodox theologian Nicholas Afanassieff cites Irenaeus in &quot;Against Heresies&quot; 3:4:1 as illuminating that during the pre-Nicene period, the Church of Rome acted as arbiter in resolving disputes between local churches. Rome&#x27;s support would ensure success, while refusal from Rome predetermined the attitude the other churches would adopt.

In the aftermath of the Decian persecution, Pope Stephen I (254-257) was asked by Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) to resolve a dispute among the bishops of Gaul as to whether those who had lapsed could be reconciled and readmitted to the Christian community. Cyprian stressed the Petrine primacy as well as the unity of the Church and the importance of being in communion with the bishops. For Cyprian, &quot;the Bishop of Rome is the direct heir of Peter, whereas the others are heirs only indirectly&quot;, and he insisted that &quot;the Church of Rome is the root and matrix of the Catholic Church&quot;. Cyprian wrote Pope Stephen asking him to instruct the bishops of Gaul to condemn Marcianus of Arles, (who refused to admit those who repented) and to elect another bishop in his stead.

It was to Pope Damasus I (366–384) that Jerome appealed in 376, to settle a dispute as to who, among three rival claimants, was the legitimate Patriarch of Antioch.

In the strictest sense of the word, &quot;decretal&quot; means a papal rescript (&quot;rescriptum&quot;), an answer of the pope when he has been appealed to or his advice has been sought on a matter of discipline. The oldest preserved decretal is a letter of Pope Siricius (r. 384-399) in response to an inquiry from Himerius, Bishop of Tarragona (fl. 385), in which Siricius issued decisions on fifteen different points, on matters regarding baptism, penance, church discipline and the celibacy of the clergy.

===Quartodeciman controversy===

The Quartodeciman controversy arose because Christians in the Roman province of Asia (Western Anatolia) celebrated Easter at the spring full moon, like the Jewish Passover, while the churches in the West observed the practice of celebrating it on the following Sunday (&quot;the day of the resurrection of our Saviour&quot;).

In 155, Anicetus, bishop of Rome, presided over a church council at Rome that was attended by a number of bishops including Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna. Although the council failed to reach agreement on the issue, ecclesiastical communion was preserved. A generation later, synods of bishops in Palestine, Pontus and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west, unanimously declared that the celebration should be exclusively on Sunday. In 193, Victor, bishop of Rome, presided over a council at Rome and subsequently sent a letter about the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman province of Asia.

In the same year, Polycrates presided over a council at Ephesus attended by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor&#x27;s authority and kept the province&#x27;s paschal tradition. Thereupon, Victor attempted to cut off Polycrates and the others who took this stance from the common unity, but later reversed his decision after bishops, that included Irenaeus of Lyon in Gaul, interceded and recommended that Victor adopt the more tolerant stance of his predecessor, Anicetus.

This incident is cited by some Orthodox Christians as the first example of overreaching by the Bishop of Rome and resistance of such by Eastern churches. Laurent Cleenewerck suggests that this could be argued to be the first fissure between the Eastern and Western churches. According to James McCue, Victor&#x27;s threatened excommunication was an &quot;intradiocesan affair&quot; between two local churches and did not pertain to the universal church.

===First Council of Nicaea===
The First Council of Nicaea was convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325. Canon IV states: &quot;A bishop is to be chosen by all the bishops of the province, or at least by three, the rest giving by letter their assent; but this choice must be confirmed by the Metropolitan.&quot; Karl Josef von Hefele says that this was probably in response to Melitius of Lycopolis, who &quot;had nominated bishops without the concurrence of the other bishops of the province, and without the approval of the metropolitan of Alexandria, and had thus occasioned a schism. This canon was intended to prevent the recurrence of such abuses.&quot;

===First Council of Constantinople and its context===
The event that is often considered to have been the first conflict between Rome and Constantinople was triggered by the elevation of the see of Constantinople to a position of honour, second only to Rome on the grounds that, as capital of the eastern Roman empire, it was now the &quot;New Rome&quot;. This was promulgated in the First Council of Constantinople (381) canon 3 which decreed: &quot;The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is New Rome.&quot; Thomas Shahan says that, according to Photius, Pope Damasus approved the council of Constantinople, but he adds that, if any part of the council were approved by this pope, it could have been only its revision of the Nicene Creed, as was the case also when Gregory the Great recognized it as one of the four general councils, but only in its dogmatic utterances.

The increasing involvement of Eastern emperors in church matters and the advancement of the see of Constantinople over the sees of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem led successive bishops of Rome to attempt a sharper definition of their ecclesial position vis-a-vis the other bishops. The first documented use of the description of Saint Peter as first bishop of Rome, rather than as the apostle who commissioned its first bishop, dates from 354, and the phrase &quot;the Apostolic See&quot;, which refers to the same apostle, began to be used exclusively of the see of Rome, a usage found also in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon. From the time of Pope Damasus, the text of (&quot;You are Peter and on this rock I will build my church&quot;) is used to support Roman primacy. Pope Innocent I (401–417) claimed that all major cases should be reserved to the see of Rome and wrote: &quot;All must preserve that which Peter the prince of the apostles delivered to the church at Rome and which it has watched over until now, and nothing may be added or introduced that lacks this authority or that derives its pattern from somewhere else.&quot; Pope Boniface I (418–422) stated that the church of Rome stood to the churches throughout the world &quot;as the head to the members&quot;, a statement that was repeated by the delegates of Pope Leo I to the Council of Chalcedon in 451.

====Relationship with bishops of other cities====
Besides Rome, Jerusalem was also held in high prestige in the early Church, both because the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus occurred there, and on account of the 1st-century Council of Jerusalem. Followers of Jesus were first referred to as &quot;Christians&quot; (as well as &quot;Catholic&quot;) in Antioch and was, together with Alexandria, important in the thought of the early Church. It is important to note, however, that the three main apostolic sees of the early Church (i.e. the See of Antioch, the See of Alexandria, and the See of Rome) were directly related to Peter. Prior to becoming Bishop of Rome, Peter was Bishop of Antioch. Additionally, his disciple Mark founded the church in Alexandria.

====Leo I====
The doctrine of the &quot;&quot; (apostolic see) asserts that every bishop of Rome, as Peter&#x27;s successor, possesses the full authority granted to this position and that this power is inviolable on the grounds that it was established by God himself and so not bound to any individual. In line with the norm of Roman law that a person&#x27;s legal rights and duties passed to his heir, Pope Leo I (440–461) taught that he, as Peter&#x27;s representative, succeeded to the power and authority of Peter, and he implied that it was through Peter that the other apostles received from Christ strength and stability. Leo argued that the apostle Peter continued to speak to the Christian community through his successors as bishop of Rome. Pope Gelasius I (492–496) stated: &quot;The see of blessed Peter the Apostle has the right to unbind what has been bound by sentences of any pontiffs whatever, in that it has the right to judge the whole church. Neither is it lawful for anyone to judge its judgment, seeing that canons have willed that it might be appealed to from any part of the world, but that no one may be allowed to appeal from it.&quot;

The historical and juridical development of the &quot;primacy of the Roman Pontiff&quot; from Pope Gregory I (590–604) to Pope Clement V (1305–1314) was a doctrinal evolution in fidelity of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;deposit of faith&quot;).

====Council of Reims====
In 1049, the Council of Reims, called by Pope Leo IX, adopted a dogmatic declaration about the primacy of the Roman Pontiff as the successor of Peter: &quot;&quot; (literal translation is &quot;it was declared that only the bishop/pontiff of the see of Rome is the primate of the universal Church and apostolic&quot;).

=== Emperor Phocas&#x27; decree ===
When Phocas took the Byzantine throne in 602, the Diocese of Rome, Bishop Gregory I, praised Phocas as a &quot;restorer of liberty&quot; and referred to him as a pious and clement lord. Meanwhile Gregory I died in 604, and also his successor, Sabinian, in 606. After almost a year of vacancy, Emperor Phocas appointed Bonafice III as the new bishop of Rome on February 19, 607 AD. Then Phocas writes through imperial decree of the Roman government, proclaims Boniface III as the &quot;Head of all the Churches&quot; and &quot;Universal Bishop&quot;. Phocas transfers the title of &quot;Universal Bishop&quot; from Diocese of Constantinople to Diocese of Rome. Boniface sought and obtained a decree from Phocas which he restated that &quot;the See of Blessed Peter the Apostle should be the head of all the Churches&quot; and ensured that the title of &quot;Universal Bishop&quot; belonged exclusively to the Bishop of Rome. This act effectively ended the attempt by Patriarch Cyriacus of Constantinople to establish himself as &quot;Universal Bishop&quot;.

===East-West Schism===

The dispute about the authority of Roman bishops reached a climax in the year 1054, when the legate of Pope Leo IX excommunicated Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius. Leo IX had, however, died before the legate issued this excommunication, depriving the legate of its authority and thereby rendering the excommunication technically invalid. Similarly, a ceremony of excommunication of Leo IX then performed by Michael I was equally invalid, since one cannot be posthumously excommunicated. This event led to the schism of the Greek and Latin churches. In itself, it did not have the effect of excommunicating the adherents of the respective churches, as the tit-for-tat excommunications, even had they been valid, would have applied to the named persons only. At the time of the excommunications, many contemporary historians, including Byzantine chroniclers, did not consider the event significant.

===Post-schism period===

==== Second Council of Lyon (1272–1274) ====
On 31 March 1272, Pope Gregory X convoked the Second Council of Lyon to act on a pledge by Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to reunite the Eastern church with the West. Wishing to end the East-West Schism that divided Rome and Constantinople, Gregory X had sent an embassy to Michael VIII, who had reconquered Constantinople, putting an end to the remnants of the Latin Empire in the East.

On 29 June 1274 (the Feast of Peter and Paul, the patronal feast of popes), Gregory X celebrated Mass in St John&#x27;s Church where both sides took part. The council declared that the Roman church possessed &quot;the supreme and full primacy and authority over the universal Catholic Church.&quot;

The council was seemingly a success, but did not provide a lasting solution to the schism. Michael&#x27;s death in December 1282 put an end to the union of Lyon. His son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos repudiated the union.

==== Reformation ====
The primacy of the Pope was again challenged in 1517 when Martin Luther began preaching against several practices in the Catholic Church, including some itinerant friars&#x27; abuses involving indulgences. When Pope Leo X refused to support Luther&#x27;s position, Luther claimed belief in an &quot;invisible church&quot; and called the pope the Antichrist.

Luther&#x27;s rejection of the primacy of the Pope led to the start of the Protestant Reformation, during which numerous Protestant sects broke away from the Catholic Church. The Church of England also broke away from the Catholic Church at this time, although for reasons different from Martin Luther and the Protestants.

==== First Vatican Council ====
The doctrine of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council, where ultramontanism achieved victory over conciliarism with the pronouncement of papal infallibility (the ability of the pope to define dogmas free from error &quot;ex cathedra&quot;) and of papal supremacy, i.e., supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the pope.

The First Vatican Council&#x27;s dogmatic constitution &quot;Pastor aeternus&quot; declared that &quot;in the disposition of God the Roman church holds the preeminence of ordinary power over all the other churches.&quot; This council also affirmed the dogma of papal infallibility, deciding that the &quot;infallibility&quot; of the Christian community extended to the pope himself, at least when speaking on matters of faith.

Vatican I defined a twofold Primacy of Peter — one in papal teaching on faith and morals (the charism of infallibility), and the other a primacy of jurisdiction involving government and discipline of the Church — submission to both being necessary to Catholic faith and salvation.

Vatican I rejected the ideas that papal decrees have &quot;no force or value unless confirmed by an order of the secular power&quot; and that the pope&#x27;s decisions can be appealed to an ecumenical council &quot;as to an authority higher than the Roman Pontiff&quot;. Paul Collins argues that &quot;(the doctrine of papal primacy as formulated by the First Vatican Council) has led to the exercise of untrammelled papal power and has become a major stumbling block in ecumenical relationships with the Orthodox (who consider the definition to be heresy) and Protestants.&quot;

Forced to break off prematurely by secular political developments in 1870, Vatican I left behind it a somewhat unbalanced ecclesiology. &quot;In theology the question of papal primacy was so much in the foreground that the Church appeared essentially as a centrally directed institution which one was dogged in defending but which only encountered one externally&quot;, according to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI).

===Anticipating Vatican II===
Pope Paul VI acknowledged with regret that &quot;the primacy of honor and jurisdiction which Christ bestowed on the Apostle Peter, and which We have inherited as his Successor&quot; is regarded as an obstacle to ecumenical reconciliation, but could not see grounds for abandoning the principle of a supreme pastoral office within the church.

===Eastern Orthodox view===

The Eastern Orthodox Church considers the Bishop of Rome to be the &quot;&quot;, that is, first among equals. An example of this would be the Chief Justice in the United States Supreme Court, who holds a pre-eminent honor, but cannot give orders to his fellow justices.

The Eastern Orthodox point out that Jesus gave the power to &quot;bind&quot; and &quot;loose&quot; not only to Peter but to all the Apostles equally (Matthew 18:18). Many Church Fathers noted Jesus&#x27; giving this authority more broadly: Tertullian, Hilary of Poitiers, John Chrysostom, and Augustine.

It has been argued that church councils did not consider papal decisions binding. The Third Ecumenical Council was called, even though Pope Celestine I condemned Nestorius as a heretic which Michael Whelton, Catholic convert to Orthodoxy, argues shows that the council did not consider the papal condemnation as definitive.

Catholic Cardinal and theologian Yves Congar stated

===21st century relations with other Christian denominations===
In the document &quot;Responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine on the Church&quot; of 29 June 2007 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith reiterated that, in the view of the Catholic Church, the Christian communities born out of the Protestant Reformation and which lack apostolic succession in the sacrament of orders are not &quot;Churches&quot; in the proper sense. The Eastern Christian Churches that are not in communion with Rome, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East, are Churches in the proper sense and sister Churches of the Catholic particular Churches, but since communion with the Pope is one of the internal constitutive principles of a particular church, they lack something in their condition, while on the other hand the existing division means that the fullness of universality that is proper to the church governed by the successor of St Peter and the bishops in communion with him is not now realised in history.

====Efforts at reconciliation====

=====Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission=====
The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) statement of Venice (1976) states that the ministry of the bishop of Rome among his brother bishops was &quot;interpreted&quot; as Christ&#x27;s will for his church; its importance was compared &quot;by analogy&quot; to the position of Peter among the apostles.

=====Joint worship service with the Archbishop of Canterbury=====
At a joint service during the first official visit of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, to the Vatican, Runcie appealed to Anglicans to consider accepting papal primacy in a reunified church. At the same time, Pope John Paul II stressed that his office must be more than a figurehead.

=====&quot;Ut unum sint&quot;=====
John Paul II invited, in &quot;Ut Unum Sint&quot;, his 1995 encyclical on commitment to ecumenism, the &quot;pastors and theologians&quot; of Churches and Ecclesial Communities not in full communion with the Catholic Church to suggest how to exercise papal primacy in ways that would unite rather than divide.

=====Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue=====
In October 2007, the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, agreed that the pope has primacy among all bishops of the Church, something which has been universally acknowledged by both churches since the First Council of Constantinople in 381 (when they were still one Church) though disagreements about the extent of his authority still continue.

The document &quot;draws an analogy among the three levels of communion: local, regional, and universal, each of which appropriately has a &#x27;first&#x27; with the role of fostering communion, in order to ground the rationale of why the universal level must also have a primacy. It articulates the principle that primacy and conciliarity are interdependent and mutually necessary.&quot; Speaking of &quot;fraternal relations between bishops&quot; during the first millennium, it states that &quot;these relations, among the bishops themselves, between the bishops and their respective &quot;protoi&quot; (firsts), and also among the &quot;protoi&quot; themselves in the canonical order (&quot;taxis&quot;) witnessed by the ancient Church, nourished and consolidated ecclesial communion.&quot; It notes that both sides agree &quot;that Rome, as the church that &#x27;presides in love&#x27; according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch, occupied the first place in the &quot;taxis&quot; (order) and that the bishop of Rome was, therefore, the &quot;protos&quot; (first) among the patriarchs. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as &quot;protos&quot;, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium&quot;; and &quot;while the fact of primacy at the universal level is accepted by both East and West, there are differences of understanding with regard to the manner in which it is to be exercised, and also with regard to its scriptural and theological foundations&quot;.

Discussions continued at Aghios Nikolaos, Crete, (a drafting committee) in September–October 2008; at Paphos, Cyprus, in October 2009; and Vienna, Austria in September 2010. Hegumen Filipp Ryabykh, the deputy head of the Russian Orthodox Church Department for External Church Relations said:

A 2008 draft text on &quot;The Role of the Bishop of Rome in the Communion of the Church in the First Millennium&quot; topic prepared by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church was leaked in 2010, which the Vienna meeting asked to be revised and amplified. This document states that &quot;Catholics and Orthodox agree that, from apostolic times, the Church of Rome has been recognised as the first among the local Churches, both in the East and in the West.&quot; Both sides agree that &quot;the primacy of the see precedes the primacy of its bishops and is the source of the latter&quot;. While in the West, &quot;the position of the bishop of Rome among the bishops was understood in terms of the position of Peter among the apostles ... the East tended rather to understand each bishop as the successor of all the apostles, including Peter&quot;; but these rather different understandings &quot;co-existed for several centuries until the end of the first millennium, without causing a break of communion&quot;.

==Opposition to the doctrine==

American religious author Stephen K. Ray, a Baptist convert to Catholicism, asserts that &quot;There is little in the history of the Church that has been more heatedly contested than the primacy of Peter and the See of Rome. History is replete with examples of authority spurned, and the history of the Church is no different.&quot;

===Protestant view===
The topic of the Papacy and its authority is among the main differences between the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations. For those who hold to the doctrine of &quot;sola scriptura&quot;, the Bible is considered to be the sole authority on Christian doctrine and theology.

In his book &quot;Repair My House: Becoming a &quot;Kingdom&quot; Catholic&quot;, Michael H. Crosby, author and Capuchin Franciscan friar, points out that Matthew 18:18 shows that the power of &quot;binding&quot; and &quot;loosing&quot; was not given to Peter alone, but to all the Apostles. Some Church Fathers, like St. John Chrysostom, considered Peter&#x27;s proclamation of faith, rather than Peter himself, to be the &quot;rock&quot; Jesus praised and said he would make the foundation of the faith. Other Christian writers say that, even if Peter is the &quot;rock&quot;, it does not mean he has exclusive power over the Church.

<text>The Super-Sons are a pair of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The characters were created by Bob Haney and Dick Dillin and first appeared in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #215 (January 1973). The characters were featured in stories about the sons of Superman and Batman.

In 2017, DC Comics launched a &quot;Super Sons&quot; monthly comic book series featuring new versions of the characters, going by the names Superboy (Jonathan Kent, the son of Superman and Lois Lane), and Robin (Damian Wayne, the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul).

==Publication history==
The Super-Sons first appeared together in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #154 (December 1965). Batman&#x27;s imaginary son was seen first in &quot;Batman&quot; #131 (April 1960), &quot;Batman&quot; #145 (February 1962) and &quot;Batman&quot; #163 (May 1964). The Super-Sons, Superman Jr. (Clark Kent Jr.) and Batman Jr. (Bruce Wayne Jr.), were college-aged versions of their superhero fathers. Their mothers are never referred to by name, nor are their faces ever shown, though Superman&#x27;s wife is dark-haired and Batman&#x27;s wife is a redhead. The Super-Sons look almost exactly like their fathers and wear identical costumes. The characters spoke with a slightly exaggerated version of the slang popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They regard each other as brothers since both understand the pressures involved in being the son of a living legend. Like his father, Batman Jr. has no superhuman powers and relies on athletic prowess and gadgets. Superman Jr., who is only half-Kryptonian, has powers levels of only half that of Superman, Sr.

Although the very first Super-Sons appearance stated that these were actual stories in the lives of Superman and Batman, the final story in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; #263, &quot;Final Secret of the Super-Sons&quot;, written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil, revealed that the Sons had never really existed — they were merely computer simulations of what might have been, created by Superman and Batman on the Man of Steel&#x27;s computer in his Fortress of Solitude.

They later inspired the characters Joel Kent and Bruce Wayne Jr. in the three &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; comic book series.

It was thought that the events of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series had erased Superman Jr. and Batman Jr. from DC continuity, but this assumption was later shown to be incorrect.

A Super-Sons story by Bob Haney was published in the comic special &quot;Elseworlds 80-Page Giant&quot; (1999). In &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tales, &quot;heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places – some that have existed, and others that can&#x27;t, couldn&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t exist&quot;. Eventually, the Super-Sons reality would be named Earth-216 and designated a Hypertime reality unaffected by the Crisis.

The Earth-154 variant of the Super-Sons (and their fathers) appear briefly during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series, during which time Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three warps reality in an attempt to restore the DC Multiverse. Their planet and countless other Earths later contract into a single &quot;New Earth&quot;. In the limited series &quot;52&quot;, it is revealed that 52 identical parallel universes were created. During his subsequent attempt to consume the multiverse, the evil Venusian worm Mister Mind altered each of the parallel worlds, creating distinct histories for each. According to &quot;DC Nation&quot; #89, one of those worlds is Earth-16, home of the Super-Sons.

In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, the Super-Sons (Chris Kent as Superman and Damian Wayne as Batman) reside on Earth-16 as members of the Just—the sons and daughters of the classic JLA who have inherited a crimeless, utopian universe and so live as idle celebrities.

==The Super-Sons stories==
The titles of the individual &#x27;Parts&#x27; of the stories are presented here as they were written in the comic books; in other words, that of Part Two of &quot;Little Town With A Big Secret&quot; was actually shown in quotation marks and the number of &quot;The Angel With A Dirty Name&quot; Part 3 was in numerical form rather than being spelled out, as were the previous two parts. These variations have thus been reflected below and are &quot;not&quot; mistakes.

Unlike the other stories, &quot;Saga of the Super Sons&quot; and &quot;Final Secret of the Super Sons&quot; were not divided into parts.

It should also be pointed out that &#x27;Super Sons&#x27; was spelled both on the story titles and on the cover of DC Comics&#x27; trade-paperback collection without a hyphen, as here.

In &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, the title of the series as given on the stories themselves tended to vary from issue to issue, i.e., &quot;Superman and Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman, Batman and their Super-Sons&quot; etc. These variations have been mentioned where they occur. &quot;Cry Not For My Forsaken Son&quot; bore only its story title and no series title was given to it at all.

===Collected edition===
In December 2007, DC Comics published a trade paperback collection of the series entitled &quot;Superman/Batman: Saga of the Super Sons&quot;. It collects the stories from: &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #215–216, 221–222, 224, 228, 230, 231, 233, 238, 242, and 263 and &quot;Elseworlds 80-Page Giant&quot; #1. The story in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; #263 is written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil, all the others by Bob Haney.

==Super Sons (2017)==

DC Comics presented a new version of the Super Sons in 2017. The two central characters are Damian Wayne, son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, and Jonathan Kent, son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane. The former is 13 years of age in this version (as of the 80-page &quot;DC Rebirth Holiday Special&quot; #1), while the latter is 10 years old. The advance releases describe them as &quot;best frenemies forever&quot; who will save the world together &quot;if they don&#x27;t kill each other first&quot;. The series was launched in February 2017 and ended in May 2018 with 16 issues and one &quot;Annual&quot;.

&quot;Adventures of the Super Sons&quot;, a 12-issue miniseries serves as a continuation of the &quot;Super Sons&quot; series, with Peter J. Tomasi as the writer and art by Carlo Barberi and Art Thibert. The first issue was released in August 2018, while the final issue was released in July 2019.

DC Comics released a digital-first series, &quot;Challenge of the Super Sons&quot;, from December 2020 to April 2021.

They were also featured in four one-shot stories: &quot;Superman &amp; Robin Special&quot; (2022), &quot;Back to School&quot; (&quot;DC&#x27;s Saved by Belle Reve&quot; anthology) (2022), &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; (&quot;DC&#x27;s Terrors Through Time&quot; anthology) (2022), and &quot;Flash&quot; #797 (2023). They also appeared as adults in Tom King&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2023), in a series of back up stories that take place many years in the future.

In the Superman (2016) series, issues 20 to 25, a storyline known as “Black Dawn” features Damian Wayne (Robin) and Jon Kent (Superboy). While their roles are not central to the overall storyline, it does effectively highlight their individual strengths and weaknesses, and sets the stage for their future team-up in the Super Sons comic book series.

Superman (2018) issue #16 features the reunion of the Super Sons. This issue marks their first meeting since Jon aged five years ahead of Damian due to time travel, significantly altering their dynamic. Superman #16 is later collected in the trade paperback Superman Vol. 3: The Truth Revealed. 

An alternate version of the Super Sons named the Bizarro Boyz appeared in the four-part story &quot;Boyzarro Re-Death&quot;. Robzarro was a member of the Bizarro Boyz, along with Boyzarro. Both the team name and character names were influenced by fans on social media.

Another alternate version appeared in the &quot;DCeased&quot; comic book series, in a world where a corrupted version of the Anti-Life Equation has infected most of Earth&#x27;s inhabitants with a zombie-like virus. 

&quot;Adventures of Superman: Jon Kent&quot; also featured a version of the Super Sons, where Prime Earth&#x27;s Jon Kent teamed up with Damian Wayne from the world of &quot;&quot;.

===Collected editions===

<doc id="718948" wikidata="Q1384021" url="?curid=718948" title="Tage Danielsson">
<text>Tage Ivar Roland Danielsson (; 5 February 1928 – 13 October 1985) was a Swedish author, actor, comedian, poet and film director. He worked together with Hans Alfredson in the comedy duo Hasse &amp; Tage.

==Early life==
Danielsson was born on 5 February 1928 in Linköping, Sweden, the son of Ivar Danielsson, a bus driver, and his wife Elsa (née Svensson). He passed &quot;studentexamen&quot; at Katedralskolan in Linköping in 1948 and received a Master of Philosophy degree from Uppsala University in 1954. There he got involved in student theatre of Östgöta Nation and became a member of the Juvenalorden, as well as serving as vice president of the Uppsala Student Union.

==Career==
After graduation, Danielsson found work at Sveriges Radio in 1955. He became head of the entertainment department&#x27;s speech section in 1956, production manager of the entertainment department in 1958, and department head from 1959 to 1962. At his work he came in contact with Hans Alfredson. They started the entertainment production company AB Svenska Ord (Swedish Words Ltd) together in 1961. Danielsson and Alfredson wrote, directed and acted in multiple revues and films over the coming decades.

In 1972 at the 8th Guldbagge Awards he won the Best Director award for the film &quot;The Apple War&quot; (1971). At the 12th Guldbagge Awards his film &quot;Release the Prisoners to Spring&quot; (1975) won the award for Best Film. At the 14th Guldbagge Awards his film &quot;The Adventures of Picasso&quot; (1978) won the award for Best Film. In 1985 his film &quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1984), based on Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s book &quot;Ronja, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1981), was entered into the 35th Berlin International Film Festival.

Svenska Ord in general, and Danielsson in particular, excelled in making scorching comments on current events in an illusorily naive and outward-lookingly friendly way that often succeeded to endear even political opponents to his particular brand of &quot;humorist humanism&quot;. He was also a constant campaigner behind the scene for causes ranging from anti-apartheid to anti-nuclear to social solidarity, he was also a regular contributor to the anarcho-syndicalist newspaper &quot;Arbetaren&quot;.

In 1980 he received an honorary doctorate at Linköping University.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Danielsson married Märta-Stina Köhler (born 1930), the daughter of Knut Köhler and Karin Janze. They had one son: Patrik (born 1961).

In January 1983, Danielsson&#x27;s summer house in Corsica was bombed. Danielsson, who had owned the house in Corsica for the past 20-25 years, left for Sweden a week before the bombing. The attack, which completely destroyed the house, was carried out by the National Liberation Front of Corsica (FLNC) as part of the Corsican conflict. The organization&#x27;s goal is to free Corsica from France.

==Death==
His death in 1985 was from skin cancer (Malignant melanoma). A statue of him can be seen just outside the grounds of his old school.

<text>The Elektron SidStation is a musical synthesizer sound module, built around the MOS Technology SID mixed-mode synthesizer chip originally used in the Commodore 64 home computer. It was produced by the Swedish synthesizer company Elektron, and was introduced in 1999. As the SID chip had not been manufactured for years, Elektron allegedly bought up nearly all the remaining stock. 

The company built the SidStation until 2003, when their initial supply of SID chips ran out. The last 100 units sold, the Final 100 Edition, were laser etched with a number on the front panel&#x27;s bottom-left corner and sold in descending order from 100 to 1. In March 2005, Elektron claimed to have encountered an additional supply of 100 SID chips and produced 100 SidStation units, selling them for € 920, USD $950, or SEK 8200 each.

In late 2006, Elektron claimed that &quot;100 became 200&quot;, and the prices were raised once again. This marks the third time that an additional 100 chips were being produced, each time claiming to be the &quot;final run&quot;. This (and the fact that some aftermarket clones of original SID chips exist) has raised skepticism as to how scarce the supply actually is, and which run is actually the final run. However, since January 18, 2007 no new SidStations have been shipped. 

As SidStations were manufactured, the company kept the price in relation to the demand, meaning that the initial SidStations were fairly cheap and later on, when the device was more sought-after, the price increased.

The appearance of the SidStation is retro and features a small LCD-display where the sound editing is done, four assignable knobs, a keypad and a controller wheel.

==Different models of SidStations==
Besides the standard grey model of SidStation, two other models exist. The beta models of SidStations used by Elektron and their beta testers had a shining red color. Around twelve red units were made and approximately half of them were sold to early customers and beta-test partners. Some of these partners sold their units at a later time giving a handful of metallic red SidStations being owned by private people. Besides the color, these beta machines had a slightly more aggressive character due to some voltages running higher in the filter section, as well as certain beta-testing modes and the ability to upgrade the firmware to a greater extent. 

Elektron also sold fifty black SidStation units, which had black aluminum casing and blue LEDs, contrary to the original green ones, called the Ninja Edition. This model also came with a different set of sound patches. There is also a blue SidStation that was made as a one off, by Elektron, for a walk in customer that just happened to see the blue shell sitting unused on the shelf .

==Sound of the SidStation==
The sound of SidStation is, of course, very similar to that of the original Commodore 64. The SID chip is well known for being noisy. By design, the oscillators never stop outputting signal—even while not in use. It&#x27;s this flaw, however, that is part of the character and sound of the SID chip.

Most SidStations contain the 6581 R4AR incarnation of the SID chip. This version is considered the best trade-off between sound, stability and conformity (which is a big deal concerning the SID chip, since they tend to sound different from unit to unit).

The SidStation is capable of producing all the waveforms of the C64, Triangle, Saw, Pulse, Mix (which is a mix between Saw and Pulse) and variable Noise. Besides this is the synth, a 4-part LFO-modulation system which can be used with Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass and various combinations of these filters (including a Notchfilter). All of these are controllable by the four knobs on top of the SidStation.

<doc id="718958" wikidata="Q1773759" url="?curid=718958" title="Bothwell">
<text>Bothwell () is a conservation village in the South Lanarkshire council area of Scotland and part of the Greater Glasgow area. It lies on the north bank of the River Clyde, adjacent to Uddingston and Hamilton, east-south-east of Glasgow city centre.

==Description and history==

An ancient settlement which was once primarily a mining village, and earlier the site of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, Bothwell is an affluent commuter town that has attracted a number of local celebrities including several professional footballers. Owing to a steady rise in property prices, Bothwell is one of Glasgow&#x27;s most prosperous satellites. In 2019, &quot;Earls Gate&quot; which overlooks Bothwell Castle was named Greater Glasgow&#x27;s most expensive street, with an average price tag of £1,125,000. In 2021 Earls Gate was again named the City&#x27;s most expensive street; according to the report this extends to the entire West of Scotland. 
The houses surrounding the Main Street are of older sandstone Victorian style whereas the newer part of the Bothwell consists of estates built in close proximity to Bothwell Castle and intertwined with Bothwell Castle Golf club. The new houses have significantly increased the population. According to the recent census report 2011, Bothwell has a population of , with the local council ward in combination with Uddingston established a year earlier. The majority of Bothwell&#x27;s residents own their own property, and household incomes are likely to exceed the national average.

===Facilities===

Bothwell has two primary schools (the rebuilt Bothwell PS and St Bride&#x27;s RC PS), a library and a bowling club. There are several small shops and businesses in the town&#x27;s Main Street, along with a handful of pubs and restaurants. The Bothwell area has many walkways, nature trails, woodlands and greenery. A footbridge links with Blantyre on the opposite bank of the river, and leads directly to the David Livingstone Centre.

The parish church (which was restored at the end of the 19th century) contains the choir of the old Gothic church of 1398. A memorial honours the poet Joanna Baillie (1762–1851) who was born in the manse.

==Bothwell Castle==
The picturesque ruin of Bothwell Castle occupies a position on a bluff above a bend in the River Clyde on the edge of Bothwell, which here takes the bold sweep famed in Scottish song as the Bothwell bank. This fortress belonged to Sir William Moray, known as &#x27;le Riche&#x27;, who died in England in 1300. It passed eventually by marriage to the House of Douglas. The lordship was bestowed in 1487 on Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Lord Hailes, 1st Earl of Bothwell. When he resigned in 1491 the title passed to &quot;Bell-the-Cat&quot;, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. The title ultimately passed to the Earls of Home.

The castle is a fine example of Gothic architecture. It consists of a great quadrangle with circular towers on the south. At the east end stand the remains of the chapel. An unpretentious mansion was built nearby by Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar (1653–1712), and was known as New Bothwell Castle, but suffered mining subsidence and was demolished in 1926. The castle can be accessed through scenic Clyde Walkways.

==Brighter Bothwell==
&quot;Brighter Bothwell&quot; is a local environmental group, formed in 2000 for the benefit of the whole community of Bothwell. Their objective is to enhance the environment directly through the endeavours of volunteers.

Since the formation of the group, many public areas have been improved and some major projects have been undertaken including the Nature Trail, The Jubilee Garden and The Marion Gilchrist Garden. In the Beautiful Scotland campaign, the group has raised the village to Silver Gilt award standard and, in 2012, Bothwell won the prize as winner of the Small Town category.

Brighter Bothwell has also encouraged the formation of two additional community groups, The Organic Growers of Bothwell and &quot;The Bothwell Scarecrow Festival&quot;. Working along with Brighter Bothwell, these groups are having a positive impact on the community.

===Scarecrow Festival===
In the autumn of 2010, inspired by a number of festivals already held in villages across the UK, Brighter Bothwell developed The &quot; Bothwell Community Scarecrow Festival&quot; to extend and develop the feeling of community in Bothwell and to support the local economy. The first festival took place in September 2011, and subsequently every year after.

The festival has become very popular and the main street is filled with imaginative scarecrows from August onwards. Many local businesses make their own scarecrows, as do the local children whose gardens are also filed with scarecrows at the time of year. Yorkhill Children&#x27;s foundation is the beneficiary of the event.

During the 2013 festival, a new event was held at Bothwell Primary School called &#x27;The Scarecrow Festival of Transport&#x27;. It was intended to be a celebration of transport throughout the ages. Various people from the village donated their automobiles for the event, such as Boyd Tunnock of the local company Tunnock&#x27;s, and Bentley Glasgow.

==Sports==
===Speedway===
Speedway racing was staged in the Bothwell Castle estate area in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The track was constructed on old railway land by club members who used it as a training track. Occasional team matches saw the &quot;Bothwell Bulls&quot; take on other training venues such as Newtongrange and High Beech.

Tommy Miller, who rose to fame with Glasgow Tigers in 1950, and Ken McKinlay, arguably the best ever Scottish speedway rider, both started out at Bothwell. The venture, safety fence and all, moved to Chapelhall.

===Golf Club===
&quot;Bothwell Castle Golf Club&quot; was officially opened on the 16th of June 1923 by the Earl of Home (father of Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home). The course covered a 110-acre site situated between the 13th century castle and the then small village of Bothwell.

In 1960 the club were unable to accept an offer to buy the course, which was purchased by a developer. By 1962, building proposals were in place resulting in the club losing 7 holes for housing, and having to develop new ground to replace these holes. This new section of the course opened in 1973.

The club finally purchased the course in 1976 for £70,000, thereby securing its long-term future. 

In 2002, a fire resulted in the complete destruction of the clubhouse. The club decided to build the replacement clubhouse in a new location closer to the centre of the course. 
Officially opened in October 2004 by &quot;Richard Cole-Hamilton CBE&quot;, the Captain of the R&amp;A Golf Club of St Andrews.

In 1997, Lady Member Sheila Beckett produced a book on the history of the Club to commemorate its 75th anniversary. 
A flat, 18-hole parkland course, Bothwell is challenging for players at all levels. The building of the new clubhouse has allowed the club to revise the course layout, with several new tee positions and some new greens.

<text>CLiki is an open source wiki application written in Common Lisp, that was under development from 2002 to 2005.

CLiki was first presented at the International Lisp Conference 2002. CLiki was the first wiki variant to introduce so called &quot;free links&quot;, using the codice_1 as an alternative to the much-criticized CamelCase.

The CLiki program is free software licensed under the MIT license. It runs under SBCL and uses the Araneida Common Lisp web server.

CLiki also operates a homepage using the software that is dedicated to the subject of Common Lisp.

==Cliki2==

Since 2011, a new version of Cliki (named &quot;Cliki2&quot;) was developed by Vladimir Sedach and Andrey Moskvitin, with major features around spam prevention. Other major features are:

*Araneida was replaced with Hunchentoot
*Real article deletion and undeletion
*Code coloring using cl-colorize
*Working list of uncategorized/orphan articles
*Pages that work well in text browsers (and hopefully screen readers)

<doc id="718962" wikidata="Q1232001" url="?curid=718962" title="Djalu Gurruwiwi">
<text>Djalu Gurruwiwi, written Djalu ( – 12 May 2022), was a Yolngu musician, artist, and leader from Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia. He was globally recognised for his acquired skill as a player, maker, and spiritual keeper of the yiḏaki (also known as didgeridoo). As a respected artist with many of his works in several galleries, he aimed to spread his culture and traditions past his own community. 

==Life==
Gurruwiwi was born at the mission station on Wirriku Island (also known as Jirgarri), one of the smaller islands in the Wessel Islands group. He has also self-reported being born on Milingimbi Island (also known as Yurruwi, in the Crocodile Islands), with both of these island groups being off Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Australia. His date of birth is uncertain (the missionaries recorded his and two brothers as having the same birthdate – officially 1 January 1930), estimated 1940 or probably earlier.

He was given the European name &quot;Willie&quot; at some point, &quot;Wulumbuyku&quot; was another Aboriginal name, and his skin name was Wamut. His father was Monyu Gurruwiwi and his mother Djikulu Yunupingu.

He was a leader of the Dhuwa moiety Gälpu clan, of the Dangu language group of the Yolngu peoples. Djalu lived in Birritjimi on the Gove Peninsula, about east of Darwin. He grew up practicing Christianity and living a traditional life in the remote area, hunting turtles with his father on a &quot;lipalipa&quot; (dug-out canoe), and with little contact with &quot;balanda&quot; (white people). The family, along with others in the clan, spent long periods on the remote island of Rrakala. They travelled across the chain of Wessel Islands from Nhulunbuy in dug-out canoes, using carved wooden paddles.As a young man Gurruwiwi lived on Galiwinku (Elcho Island), working as a lumberjack, cutting large trees by hand. He was also given the responsibility for carrying out punishment for tribal law, becoming both respected and feared.

After a period when he succumbed to the destructive effects of alcohol after it was introduced to the remote areas, he says he was visited by a spirit in gaol one night and &quot;found Jesus&quot;. He gave up drinking and devoted his life to the yiḏaki and spiritual and other studies. In 1994 he completed studies in Christian theology at Nungalinya College in Darwin, and became a respected Yolŋu lawman as well as a Christian leader.

As of 2020, Gurruwiwi and his family, along with some other members of the Galpu clan, lived at Birritjimi (also known as Wallaby Beach) on the Gove Peninsula They live in homes constructed in the 1970s to provide accommodation for Rio Tinto mining executives, handed over to traditional owners represented by Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation in 2008. The houses are in very poor condition and are facing demolition, as they are no longer deemed safe. The Northern Territory Government is providing emergency repairs, but says that the Northern Land Council is responsible for the maintenance of the homes. Rirratjingu has applied for funds to help move the residents to Nhulunbuy, Gunyangara and Yirrkala, but Djalu and his son Larry were reluctant to leave Birritjimi.

Gurruwiwi died in Arnhem Land after a long illness on 12 May 2022, believed to be aged in his late 80s.

==Family==
Gurruwiwi&#x27;s wife is a sister of Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, and they have several sons and at least one daughter, Zelda.

His son Larry Larrtjaŋga Gurruwiwi is the future spiritual keeper of the yiḏaki and custodian of the Yolngu songlines and healing techniques passed down by his father. He featured as a didgeridu player in the feature film &quot;Jindalee Lady&quot; (1992), directed by Aboriginal director Brian Syron (credited as Larry Yapuma Gurruwiwi).

Larry and Andrew Gäyalaŋa Gurruwiwi led the Bärra West Wind band, with Jason Guwanbal Gurruwiwi, Vernon Marritŋu Gurruwiwi, Dion Marimunuk Gurruwiwi, and Adrian Guyundu Gurruwiwi also listed as members of the band in 2010. The band and Larry are featured in the 2017 film &quot;Westwind: Djalu&#x27;s Legacy&quot;.

Larry, Jason and Vernon, in their new band, Malawurr, performed in Melbourne in June 2019 to help raise funds for the new film, &quot;Morning Star&quot; (see below) ahead of their first European tour, playing at WOMAD in the UK and other festivals in England and France. The band was scheduled to give a yiḏaki workshop and performance at the Rainbow Serpent Festival at Lexton, Victoria on 26 January 2020.

== Music, culture, and law ==

Gurruwiwi spent much time over several decades crafting his instruments and refining his technique. He sold his pieces to the local community arts centre, and various non-Indigenous workers and visitors. He had the ability to find adequate material for the yidaki by just walking through the woods and allowing his connection to nature to choose the correct log for making the instrument.

Gurruwiwi was a senior member of his clan, having learned to play and make the yiḏaki from his father, Monyu, an important leader and warrior. Monyu gave Djalu the role of primary custodian of the yiḏaki for his clan, which is significant also for the wider Yolŋu communities, because other Arnhem Land clans see the Gälpu clan as one of the primary custodians of the instrument. However, there are many other Yolŋu people with the same role within their own clan, and their own particular type of yiḏaki.

Upon the death of his father, Djalu assumed the role of the elder responsible for passing on the skills as well as the cultural importance of the instrument. He became known among his people as the senior player and maker of the yiḏaki after attending many ceremonies with his brothers, who were singers, and also became fully informed in Yolŋu law. Much of the knowledge and cultural practice that he acquired is held sacred, so Gurruwiwi is held in high esteem.

In 1986, his reputation as craftsman was given a world stage when several of his friends and relatives formed the musical group Yothu Yindi, and commissioned Gurruwiwi to make their yiḏakis. Yothu Yindi has both Yolŋu and &quot;balanda&quot; members and spanned cultural boundaries, going on to win several ARIA awards and international fame.

Gurruwiwi&#x27;s source of spiritual power has been linked to Wititj, the huge ancestral rainbow serpent. In the clan legends, the Wititj was said to create thunder and lightning as it moved across the land, but is also associated with the calm freshwater systems where the spirits reside, among water lilies and palm trees. The yiḏaki sometimes also contain these qualities: some have powerful acoustics, called &quot;baywarayiḏaki&quot;, (the power of lightning and thunder); others are &quot;Djuŋgarriny&quot;, long and deep-sounding, with a gentle, soothing sound, but also powerful: the vibrations are said to stir Wititj.

===Tours and performances===
Gurruwiwi delivered the first Yiḏaki masterclass at the inaugural Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures (held at Gulkula, a significant Gumatj ceremonial site about from the township of Nhulunbuy) in 1999, and has delivered all subsequent Yiḏaki Masterclasses at the Festival since.

He has attended numerous other festivals and events both in Australia and abroad, including: 
* 2002 Rripangu Yiḏaki Festival, Eisenbach, Germany
* 2003 Joshua Tree Festival, USA
* 2003 Indigenous Peoples Commission cultural visit, Taipei, Taiwan
* 2004 Dubai Sister Cities Forum, United Arab Emirates
* 2005 Yiḏaki Festa 2005, Okuhida &amp; Tokyo, Japan
* 2005 Played for Nelson Mandela in Sydney
* 2007 Mulu Music Festival, Mooloolaba, Australia

At the 2015 edition of Womadelaide, he participated in an &quot;Artists in Conversation&quot; session as well as a performance that included Gotye and the Bärra (West Wind) musicians in Adelaide, South Australia.

==Films and videos==
===&quot;Westwind: Djalu&#x27;s Legacy&quot;===
In 2017, &quot;Westwind: Djalu&#x27;s Legacy&quot; was released. It was directed by British filmmaker Ben Strunin, and Djalu&#x27;s son Larry Gurruwiwi, and multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter Gotye are in the cast. Initially titled &quot;Baywara&quot; (Yolngu for &quot;lightning power&quot;, which features as a theme), the story tells of Gurruwiwi&#x27;s need to pass on the sacred knowledge of the yidaki and its songlines, and Larry&#x27;s initial reluctance to take on the role. The film&#x27;s title echoes that of Larry&#x27;s band, Bärra West Wind (Bärra being the Galpu name of the West Wind songline).

The film played to packed houses at the 2018 Melbourne International Film Festival. 

=== &quot;In Between Songs&quot; ===
Joshua Bell, emmy award nominee, anthropologist interested in aboriginal artworks and music, directed a documentary about Gurruwiwi called “In Between Songs.” He helps share and expose problems that Australian aboriginal artists face in order to maintain their lifestyle in the midst of the contemporary world. During a personal interview with Gurruwiwi, he shares that he remembers Japanese bombings on his homeland during World War II. Because neither him nor his family have ever been exposed to a plane, let alone an explosion, they cheered. They had naturally felt a sense of celebration over a sense of fear. This is yet another depiction of the Yolngu’s lack of exposure to modern war, and the modern world as a whole. 

===&quot;Morning Star&quot;===
The maker of &quot;Westwind: Djalu&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, Ben Strunin, was invited by Djalu and Larry Gurruwiwi to make a sequel to &quot;Westwind&quot;, which is in the process of crowdfunding the film. It follows the brothers&#x27; band, Malawurr, on tour through England, the Czech Republic, Wales, and France in 2019. The film will also include Larry&#x27;s participation in groundbreaking medical research, &quot;to quantify the effects of the traditional vibrational sound healing that he was taught by Djalu&quot;.

===Other films and videos===
Gurruwiwi has also featured in other films:
*2000 &quot;Yidaki&quot;. Directed by Michael Butler, narrated by Jack Thompson, produced by Michelle White for Discovery Channel 
*2014 &quot;In Between Songs&quot;. Written, directed, produced, and co-edited by Joshua Bell and narrated by James Cromwell. In 2006, Bell spent six months in Nhulunbuy with Gurruwiwi, his wife, his sister, and various family members who came and went; they also traveled to the remote island of Rrakala, where Gurruwiwi and his family lived for long stretches when he was a child.

He also features in numerous YouTube videos, which attract tens of thousands of views.

== Recognition, influence, and legacy==
===Awards===
Guruwiwi won the 2015 National Indigenous Music Award in the Traditional Song of the Year category, with East Journey, for &quot;Mokuy &amp; Bonba&quot;.

=== &quot;Yidaki: Didjeridu and the Sound of Australia&quot; ===
Gurruwiwi was the main consultant for &quot;Yidaki: Didjeridu and the Sound of Australia&quot;, ex exhibition curated by the South Australian Museum in 2017. This exhibition was dedicated to learning about the power of this instrument, and what it meant to the Yolngu people. Not only did it aim to educate what the instrument could do, but also to demonstrate how it could communicate to the rest of the world outside of Australia, which was always Gurruwiwi&#x27;s aim, as he consistently tried to use his instrument and music to bridge the gap between different cultures. 

===Teaching ===
Gurruwiwi spread international master classes to outside continents such as Europe, Asia, and North America. He used to hold annual yidaki workshops at the Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures for advanced students, and produced two instructional albums on how to play the instrument.

<text>David James &quot;Tiger&quot; Williams (born February 3, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1974 to 1988. He played in the 1981 NHL All-Star Game and the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals. He is the NHL&#x27;s career leader in penalty minutes. He was nicknamed &quot;Tiger&quot; as a 5-year-old by his minor hockey coach in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. 

==NHL career==
Williams was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round (31st overall) of the 1974 NHL amateur draft. He was also drafted by the Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey Association (WHA) in the third round (33rd overall) in the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft, but he signed with the Maple Leafs.

Williams was best known as an enforcer, but he was also able to score goals. He played on five different NHL teams during his career. He made his NHL debut with the Maple Leafs on January 7, 1975 against the New York Islanders. He broke many Maple Leaf and NHL records for penalty minutes and led the league twice with 338 minutes in 1976–77 and 298 in 1978–79. During his best season in Toronto, he scored 22 goals in 55 games, then on February 18, 1980 he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks for Rick Vaive and Bill Derlago. He scored 8 more goals in 23 games that season with Vancouver for a total of 30 goals.

The next season, 1980–81, in Vancouver, Williams scored a career high of 35 goals, the most among the Canucks, and 62 points. He also led the league in penalty minutes with 343, the third highest number in his career. He also earned a place in the mid-season All-Star game, in which he played on a line with Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy. He played a key role in the team&#x27;s surprise run to the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals. Williams played in Vancouver until the end of the 1983–84 season.

After Vancouver, Williams played for the Detroit Red Wings for most of the 1984–85 NHL season, then was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. In Los Angeles, he set his career high of 358 penalty minutes for one season. He was traded to the Hartford Whalers during the 1987–88 NHL season. After 26 games the Whalers placed him on waivers and released him on February 12, 1988. He retired shortly thereafter.

Bryan Trottier, who had a long and illustrious career with the New York Islanders, credits Williams with talking him out of quitting hockey as a youngster.

==After the NHL==

In 1984 Williams published his autobiography, &quot;Tiger: A Hockey Story&quot;, co-written by James Lawton. In 1987, he released a cookbook entitled &quot;Done Like Dinner: Tiger In the Kitchen&quot;, co-written with Kasey Wilson. It included many hockey-inspired recipes, including &quot;Habs Tourtière&quot;, &quot;Stanley Cup Bars&quot;, and &quot;Luc Robitaille&#x27;s Lasagna Omelette&quot;.

Williams re-emerged briefly as an inline hockey player in 1993, appearing in one game and scoring two points for the Vancouver Voodoo of Roller Hockey International.

In 1996, Canadian punk rock band The Hanson Brothers spearheaded a campaign to agitate for Williams&#x27; induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame. They included a mail-in postcard in their album &quot;Sudden Death&quot; which purchasers could send to the Hall.

As a guest on Tony Gallagher&#x27;s phone-in radio program, Williams claimed that Canucks manager Pat Quinn attempted to have his jersey number 22 sweater retired by the team. However, rules at the time required the Canucks to ask permission from the previous player who wore it, Bob Manno. Manno refused, even, according to Williams, when the team offered him money to grant permission. Number 22 was later worn by (and retired in honour of) Canucks alternate captain and Art Ross trophy winner, Daniel Sedin.

At the 2002 NHL All-Star Game in Los Angeles, the NHL held the NHL All-Star Celebrity Challenge. The home team all wore number 22 in honour of Williams.

On February 9, 2018, Williams was charged with sexual assault while on a military trip to Latvia. These charges were withdrawn by Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham after he issued an apology.

Williams was arrested and charged with one count of uttering a threat to cause death and one count of assault stemming from an April 10, 2023 incident in Beaver Flat, Saskatchewan. Police said the other man involved did not sustain injuries or require medical attention.

He appeared as himself in the first episode of the Canadian sitcom &quot;Rent-a-Goalie&quot;.

<doc id="718966" wikidata="Q544338" url="?curid=718966" title="Ralph H. Fowler">
<text>Sir Ralph Howard Fowler (17 January 1889 – 28 July 1944) was an English physicist.

==Education==
Ralph H. Fowler was born at Roydon, Essex, on 17 January 1889 to Howard Fowler, from Burnham, Somerset, and Frances Eva, daughter of George Dewhurst, a cotton merchant from Manchester. He was initially educated at home, going on to attend Evans&#x27; preparatory school at Horris Hill and Winchester College. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge and studied mathematics, becoming a wrangler in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos.

==War service==
In World War I he obtained a commission in the Royal Marine Artillery and was seriously wounded in his shoulder in the Gallipoli campaign. The wound enabled his friend Archibald Hill to use his talents properly. As Hill&#x27;s second in command he worked on anti-aircraft ballistics in the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; on Whale Island. He made a major contribution on the aerodynamics of spinning shells. He was awarded the OBE in 1918.

==Academic career==
In 1919, Fowler returned to Trinity and was appointed college lecturer in mathematics in 1920. Here he worked on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, bringing a new approach to physical chemistry. With Arthur Milne, a comrade during the war, he wrote a seminal work on stellar spectra, temperatures, and pressures. In 1925 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He became research supervisor to Paul Dirac and, in 1926, worked with him on the statistical mechanics of white dwarf stars. In 1927 he was one of the participants of the fifth Solvay Conference on Physics that took place at the International Solvay Institute for Physics in Belgium. In 1928 he published (with Lothar Nordheim) a seminal paper that explained the physical phenomenon now known as field electron emission, and helped to establish the validity of modern electron band theory. In 1931, he was the first to formulate and label the zeroth law of thermodynamics. In 1932 he was elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1933 he worked with John Bernal to develop a model for the structure of water and ice known as the ice rules.

In 1939, when World War II began, he resumed his work with the Ordnance Board, despite poor health, and was chosen for scientific liaison with Canada and the United States. He knew America well, having visiting professorships at Princeton and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. For this liaison work he was knighted in 1942 (see MAUD Committee). He returned to Britain later in the war and worked for the Ordnance Board and the Admiralty up until a few weeks before his death in 1944.

Fifteen Fellows of the Royal Society and three Nobel Laureates (Chandrasekhar, Dirac, and Mott) were supervised by Fowler between 1922 and 1939. In addition to Milne, he worked with Sir Arthur Eddington, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Paul Dirac, Homi J. Bhabha, and Sir William McCrea. It was Fowler who introduced Dirac to quantum theory in 1923. Fowler also put Dirac and Werner Heisenberg in touch with each other through Niels Bohr. At Cambridge he supervised the doctoral studies of 64 students, including John Lennard-Jones, Paul Dirac and Garrett Birkhoff.

The Fowler Islands, in Crystal Sound, on the Antarctic Peninsula were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in his honour.

==Personal life==
Fowler was a keen amateur cricketer who played as a wicket-keeper. He played for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship in 1908 and 1909.

In 1921 he married Eileen Mary (1901–1930), the only daughter of Ernest Rutherford. They had four children, two daughters and two sons. Eileen died after the birth of their last child, Ruth Fowler Edwards, a geneticist and wife of Robert G. (Bob) Edwards, the &quot;father&quot; of in vitro fertilization and 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate. One of his grandchildren is Mary Fowler, a geophysicist and the sixth Master (2012–2020) of Darwin College, Cambridge.

<text>Olaya Herrera Airport () is an airport located in Medellín, Colombia, that serves regional and domestic flights. Additionally, the airport is used by general aviation and features several hangars for charters.

It was formerly known as &quot;Medellin International Airport&quot; prior to the opening of José María Córdova International Airport in August 1985, which is located in the nearby municipality of Rionegro, east of Medellin. Between the two airports, there were more than 3.5 million passengers per year, which makes it the second busiest passenger city in Colombia after Bogotá.

In 2016, the airport handled 831,181 passengers, and 848,525 in 2017.

==History==
Colombian businessman Gonzalo Mejía saw an opportunity for the development of an airport in Medellin, given that the mountainous topography surrounding the city made land transport to and from the area difficult, and that the nearest airport was in Puerto Berrio. He secured financing from wealthy businessmen, chose the land where the airport sits today and overcame obstacles imposed by the local government. He founded Uraba Medellin Central Airways and established it as a subsidiary of Pan American Airways, which at the time had the prospect of becoming the dominant player in global aviation. The airport opened on July 5, 1932, and was named after the then president of Colombia, Enrique Olaya Herrera, who had supported Mejía and his idea of an airport in Medellin.

In the 1940s the city was growing rapidly and new aircraft of the time required better facilities. Therefore, Mejía signed a contract in 1945 for the expansion of the runway and the existing facilities, a work that was completed on May 1, 1947.

In the 1970s, the airport was again over capacity and unable to meet demand, so the construction of new and larger José María Córdova International Airport in the nearby locality of Rionegro was announced. This resulted in the closure of Olaya Herrera Airport in 1986, a year after the new airport opened, and the reallocation of its land to a park. However, many people asked for the airport to remain open, and in 1991, it reopened with only domestic flights after a ruling by Aerocivil. In the same year it closed, the airport saw some improvements as a result of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to the city in July. The visit also inspired the name for the park which remains on the western portion of the airport grounds: the &quot;Aeroparque Juan Pablo II&quot;.

It was also one of the mainstays of carrier ACES from its beginnings to its demise in August 2003.

Today it is an airport with heavy use and constant growth (second in number of operations in Colombia) and was declared a national monument on October 19, 1995, for its historical, cultural, and architectural value for the city of Medellin and Colombia. In 2008, the national government gave the airport and five others in Colombia under concession to operating company &quot;Airplan&quot;, which is conducting a series of renovations to the terminal (at the time of writing they are ongoing).

With an investment of more than US$27 million, Airplan began the transformation under the parameters defined in its concession contract with the Aeronáutuica Public Establecimeinto Olaya Herrera. The modernization plan began in March 2009 and ends in 2014. Among the main objectives are to ensure aviation safety, passenger comfort, and meeting the requirements of ICAO, Aerocivil, and IATA. Olaya Herrera Airport operational spaces have Category B, according to IATA.

== Structure and capacity ==
There are restrictions on the types of aircraft operating from the airport due to its classification as regional airport. Commercial flights can operate aircraft of up to 50 passengers, with the exception of Satena, which operates Embraer 170 aircraft carrying up to 76 passengers.

The passenger terminal has two waiting rooms off the main aircraft apron (which has a capacity of over 30 aircraft). It also has a shopping area with banking establishments, offices and shops, a food court, 11 double counters, airline check-in, a smoking room, and close connection with the Plaza Gardel.

The airport has 111 hangars located south of the terminal, where the executive offices of several commercial, charter, and cargo airlines, as well as flight schools can also be found. Aires Airlines built a hangar on the north end of the airport in order to service aircraft and reaffirm their commitment to Medellin and the new base of operations at the airport. Flight schools Aviation Antioqueña Academy and the Falcons School of Aviation, operate from the hangar area as well.

Along with five other airports, Olaya Herrera Airport was given in concession to private operator Airplan to manage. The proposed works include a total refurbishment of the terminal, the construction of a cargo terminal, repairing the track platform, implementing new security systems, the expansion and refurbishment of waiting rooms and baggage claim belts, construction of a new control tower on the west side, construction of a business aviation terminal that will serve domestic and international flights of this type (with the intention of encouraging the return of international flights to the airport), new shopping areas, among others.

Aerolínea de Antioquia has its headquarters on the airport property and has six hangars to store and perform maintenance on their planes. West Caribbean Airways, when it existed, had its corporate headquarters, operational center, and call center in Hangar 73 on the airport grounds.

==Statistics==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 24 June 1935, Argentinian tango singer Carlos Gardel and nine others were killed in a collision between two Ford Trimotor airplanes at the airport.

*On 1 March 1950, a C-47 (registration HK-507) operated by SAM crashed during approach to the airport after encountering adverse weather conditions. The aircraft was returning to the airport after a test flight following repairs to the left engine. During the approach, however, the airplane lost altitude due to severe weather and the left wing impacted a house causing the left engine to detach and the aircraft to plummet to the ground a few hundred meters short of the runway. The co-pilot and a mechanic on board the aircraft perished on impact.
*On 13 June 1951, a C-47 (registration HK-504) operated by SAM took off from the airport for a cargo flight to Cartagena but crashed minutes later while attempting to return to the airport after experiencing technical problems. The 2-man crew and one person on the ground perished in the incident.
*On 31 March 1991, a Vickers Viscount (registration HK-1708) of Intercontinental de Aviación made an emergency landing at the airport after experiencing an instrument failure during a cargo flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogota to Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport on the Caribbean island of San Andrés. While cruising at both artificial horizons failed during turbulence and control of the aircraft was only regained at . Inspection after landing revealed structural damage beyond economic repair, probably caused by a gear collapse suffered previously on 14 February 1988.
*On 30 November 1996, ACES flight 148 bound to Bahía Solano with a stopover in Quibdó (Chocó) stalled and crashed into a mountain after takeoff. Of the 15 people on board, 14 died in the crash. The cause of the stall and the subsequent crash was found to be the aircraft being overloaded.

*On 15 October 2004, a Douglas DC-3C (registration HK-1504) belonging to carrier AeroVanguardia flew into electricity lines and crashed near Medellín on approach to Olaya Herrera Airport while performing a domestic cargo flight from La Vanguardia Airport, Villavicencio to José María Córdova International Airport, Medellín. The flight had been diverted to Olaya Herrera as alternate due to fog. The three crew were killed.
*On 18 February 2009, a Basler BT-67 (registration PNC-0211) of the Colombian National Police was destroyed by the accidental detonation of a number of hand grenades. Eight people were injured, four of them seriously. The aircraft was due to fly 25 police officers to El Caraño Airport, Quibdó.
*On 2 July 2013, two passengers on board an ADA flight attempted to rob someone outside the plane who allegedly had large sums of money and some kilograms of gold. Police started shooting at the assailants on the runway when they found out what was happening. Eventually three people were arrested. The incident caused the airport to be closed for around 45 minutes.

<doc id="718973" wikidata="Q7544485" url="?curid=718973" title="Smethwick Engine">
<text>The Smethwick Engine is a Watt steam engine made by Boulton and Watt, which was installed near Birmingham, England, and was brought into service in May 1779. Now at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, it is the oldest working steam engine and the oldest working engine in the world.

==History==
Originally, it was one of two steam engines used to pump water back up to the summit level of the BCN Old Main Line (Birmingham Canal) canal at Smethwick, not far from the Soho Foundry where it was made. The other engine, also built by Boulton and Watt, was at the other end of the summit level at Spon Lane. In 1804 a second Boulton and Watt engine was added alongside the 1779 engine.

The engines were needed because local water sources were insufficient to supply water to operate the six locks either side of the canal&#x27;s original summit. The locks could have been avoided if a tunnel had been built, but the ground was too unstable for James Brindley to build a tunnel using the techniques available at the time. In the 1780s, a cutting was constructed by John Smeaton, enabling three of the six locks on each side to be removed.
In the 1820s, Thomas Telford constructed a new canal parallel to the old in a deeper cutting, at the Birmingham Level, creating the largest man-made earthworks in the world at the time. It was spanned by the Galton Bridge. The engine was still needed, despite both these developments, and Thomas Telford constructed the Engine Arm Aqueduct carrying the Engine Arm branch canal over his New Main Line so that coal could still be transported along the arm to feed the Smethwick Engine.
In 1892, a replacement engine was built in a new pumping house, now Grade II listed, next to Brasshouse Lane, as the original Smethwick Engine was considered uneconomic to repair; the latter was removed for preservation in 1897–98 to the BCN, later British Waterways, Ocker Hill depot where it remained until acquired by Birmingham City Council. It is now part of the collection of Birmingham Museums and is on display at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum at Millennium Point. It is the oldest working engine in the world.
The engine house was demolished in 1897. Its original site and foundations can still be seen on Bridge Street North in Smethwick, just north of the junction with Rolfe Street. Tours of the site can be arranged through the Galton Valley Canal Heritage Centre which is based in the New Smethwick Pumping Station and regularly opened by Sandwell Museum Service and The Friends of Galton Valley.

The pumping station was featured in an episode of &quot;The Water Boatman&quot; presented by Alan Herd on the Discovery Shed TV channel in November 2011.

<doc id="718974" wikidata="Q67080853" url="?curid=718974" title="Katzenberger Trial">
<text>The Katzenberger Trial was a notorious Nazi show trial. A Jewish businessman and leading member of the Nuremberg Jewish community, Lehmann (Leo) Katzenberger, was accused of having an affair with a young &quot;Aryan&quot; woman, and on 14 March 1942 was sentenced to death. The trial&#x27;s presiding judge, Oswald Rothaug, was later tried at the Nuremberg trials (see Judges&#x27; Trial) and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Katzenberger Trial later provided a subplot in the 1961 film &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;.

==Background==
Leo Katzenberger (born 28 November 1873 in Maßbach, near Bad Kissingen) and his two brothers owned a large wholesale shoe shop, as well as 30 shoe shops throughout southern Germany. Katzenberger was a leading member of the Nuremberg Jewish community, and from 1939 was chairman of the Nuremberg Jewish Cultural Organization. He had a long-standing friendship with a young photographer, Irene Seiler (née Scheffler, born 26 April 1910 in Guben), who rented rooms in an apartment house the Katzenbergers owned that was next to the firm&#x27;s offices. For years, local gossips had claimed that Seiler and Katzenberger were having an affair. Both were married.

==Trial==
An unknown person denounced Katzenberger to the authorities, and he was arrested on 18 March 1941 under the so-called &quot;Rassenschutzgesetz&quot; (&quot;Racial Protection Law&quot;), one of the Nuremberg Laws, which made it a criminal offence, &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (&quot;racial defilement&quot;), for Aryans to have sexual relations with Jews. Katzenberger consistently denied the charges, as did Seiler, who claimed their relationship was like that of a father and daughter. The investigating judge initially concluded there was too little evidence to proceed with the case, but the investigation attracted the attention of Oswald Rothaug, a judge known for his severity and fervent support for Nazism. Recognising the publicity such a trial would generate and seeing it as a way to display his Nazi credentials and further his career, Rothaug arranged for the case to be brought to him. He sent tickets for the trial to all the prominent Nazis in Nuremberg.

No conclusive evidence was presented during the trial that Katzenberger and Seiler had ever had an affair (Seiler had been Katzenberger&#x27;s tenant since 1932), let alone that it had continued during the war. The law at the time did not call for the death sentence for breaking the &quot;Rassenschutzgesetz&quot;; the normal sentence would have been several years&#x27; imprisonment. Despite this, however, the &quot;Volkschädlingsgesetz&quot;, a wartime law, allowed capital punishment if one made use of wartime regulations such as the blackout to commit a crime. Based on a single eyewitness account that Katzenberger had left Seiler&#x27;s apartment &quot;when it was already dark&quot;, Rothaug applied this law to sentence Katzenberger to death.

==Aftermath==
Katzenberger was guillotined at Stadelheim Prison in Munich on 2 June 1942. Seiler was found guilty of perjury for denying an affair had taken place and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment: in accordance with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s wishes, women were not charged under the Racial Protection Law, but could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice. She died in July 1984 in Apolda, Germany, aged 74.

Even among some Nazi officials, the tenuous grounds on which Katzenberger had been sentenced to death caused disquiet. Rothaug was moved to a state attorney&#x27;s job in Berlin in 1943 because Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack considered him unfit to be a judge. In 1947 the Americans tried Rothaug, partly for his role in the Katzenberger trial, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Rothaug was released in December 1956, aged 59, and died in Cologne in 1967, aged 70.

<text>Aberdeen is a small town in the upper Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, in Upper Hunter Shire. It is 12 kilometres north of Muswellbrook on the New England Highway.

==History==
In 1828 Thomas Potter McQueen was granted 10,000 acres, and named the small township after George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen. In 1837 Segenhoe Inn was built, which Potter McQueen named after Segenhoe Manor, in Bedfordshire, where he was born in 1791.
Aberdeen Post Office opened on 1 August 1856.

==Population==

According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 1,872 people in Aberdeen.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 10.6% of the population. 
* 89.3% of people were born in Australia and 93.2% of people only spoke English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 27.0%, Catholic 24.8% and No Religion 33.4%.

==Today==
Aberdeen has its own pre-school, which was founded in 1977. The town contains two schools: the Aberdeen Public School, catering from kindergarten to Grade 6; and St. Joseph&#x27;s High School, a Catholic co-educational high school catering for Grades 7 through to 12.

Aberdeen has two churches – St Thomas&#x27;s Catholic Church, and St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church. It once had a third church, St Paul&#x27;s Uniting Church, which has now been turned into an art gallery called the Artemis Gallery.

St Joseph&#x27;s Aberdeen High School is located next to St Thomas&#x27;s Catholic Church.

The town has a local rugby league team, the Aberdeen Tigers.

For travellers, there are two main areas for accommodation in the town: the Aberdeen Motel, which is on the southern edge of the town; and the Segenhoe Inn, which is situated towards the northern end of town. The Commercial Hotel is also available for budget accommodation.

== Transport ==
Aberdeen is on the Main North railway line, and is serviced by a daily Xplorer long-distance service in each direction between Sydney and Armidale, as well as two/three local services in each direction between Scone and Newcastle.

Osborn’s Buses runs a bus service between Aberdeen, Scone and Muswellbrook. There are approximately 20 services per week in each direction.

==Abattoirs==
Aberdeen is possibly best known for the former abattoirs in the town centre, which operated for well over 100 years, before the most recent owners - an American company called Conagra - decided to close down their New South Wales abattoirs and concentrate on their Queensland operations. One factor in closing down what was once a very important abattoir for Conagra, was that the financial cost of upgrading the Aberdeen Abattoir was deemed too high, thus the abattoir - which was the largest single employer in Aberdeen - was closed in 1999. Hundreds of people were left without work, and despite promises from both the New South Wales and Federal governments to encourage new businesses to open up in the area, beyond expansion of coal mining and associated industries, nothing of note eventuated.

==Notable people==
* Katherine Knight (born 24 October 1955), murderer who killed her partner, skinned him and cooked his body parts
*Joseph Brown (born 19 May 2004), Australian filmmaker and author

<doc id="718979" wikidata="Q2013915" url="?curid=718979" title="Adriaan van Maanen">
<text>Adriaan van Maanen (March 31, 1884 – January 26, 1946) was a Dutch-American astronomer. Born in Friesland, he studied astronomy at the University of Utrecht, earning his Ph.D. in 1911, and worked briefly at the University of Groningen. In 1911, he came to the United States to work as a volunteer in an unpaid capacity at Yerkes Observatory. Within a year he got a position at the Mount Wilson Observatory, where he remained active until his death in 1946.

Van Maanen claimed that his astrometric measurements of spiral nebulae revealed detectable internal motions, supporting the idea that these nebulae were local, stellar and gaseous systems that existed in our galaxy. His measurements were not consistent with Edwin Hubble&#x27;s discovery that the Andromeda Nebula and other spiral nebulae were extragalactic objects. The speed of rotation he calculated for the nebulae, if Hubble were correct as to their extragalactic nature, would have had their Cepheid stars moving at speeds faster than that of light. Van Maanen&#x27;s astrometric measurements were subsequently found to be in error.

In 1924, van Maanen became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Astrometric measurements==
In the first and second decade of the 20th century there was a large controversy in the astronomical world about the size of the Milky Way, the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies. The competing theories were the subject of the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis in April 1920. Shapley believed that spiral galaxies were nearby objects within the Milky Way, and to support his position, he used Van Maanen&#x27;s astrometric measurements; van Maanen had claimed to have detected the rotation of the spiral arms of spiral galaxies, finding that the rotational period would be about 100,000 years. Curtis believed that spiral galaxies were objects like the Milky Way and thus had to have a similar size, believed to be 5 kiloparsecs (kpc) at that time. A rotational period of 100,000 years would require that the spiral arms were rotating faster than the speed of light. Curtis agreed that if van Maanen&#x27;s results were correct, the spiral nebulae could not be distant galaxies. However, Curtis rejected the results, believing them to be in error.

Later astronomers re-examined van Maanen&#x27;s measurements, and concluded that he had made a serious error. He used a stereo blink comparator to compare new plates with plates some 10–20 years old. By blinking between those two plates he could detect small discrepancies on the positions of the objects. His reference objects were the field stars fairly near the edge of the plates. However, he did not take into account optical distortions which affected the apparent positions of these stars. This caused systematic errors resulting in imaginary movements.

A possible contributing factor is that van Maanen may have been experiencing confirmation bias. As it was widely believed that the &quot;spiral nebulae&quot; were relatively nearby and therefore ought to have a detectable rotation, a result which appeared to support that would not have been subject to as much scrutiny as one which contradicted it.

<doc id="718989" wikidata="Q646893" url="?curid=718989" title="Nepean River">
<text>The Nepean River (Darug: Yandhai), is a major perennial river, located in the south-west and west of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Nepean River, and, continuing by its downstream name, the Hawkesbury River, almost encircles the metropolitan region of Sydney.

The headwaters of the Nepean River rise near Robertson, about south of Sydney and about from the Tasman Sea. The river flows north in an unpopulated water catchment area into Nepean Reservoir, which supplies potable water for Sydney. North of the dam, the river forms the western edge of Sydney, flowing past the town of Camden and the city of Penrith, south of which flowing through the Nepean Gorge. Near Wallacia it is joined by the dammed Warragamba River; and north of Penrith, near Yarramundi, at its confluence with the Grose River, the Nepean becomes the Hawkesbury River.

==Changes to the natural flow of the river==
The river supplies water to Sydney&#x27;s five million people as well as supplying agricultural production. This, combined with increased pressures from land use change for urban development, means the river has been suffering significant stress.

There are eleven weirs located on the Nepean River that significantly regulate its natural flow. The river has been segmented into a series of weir lakes rather than a freely flowing river and is also impacted by dams in the Upper Nepean catchment.

The Wallacia Weir was initially built as a wooden weir for the John Blaxland flour mill at Grove Farm. The first Australian fishsteps were built when the current concrete weir was built at the beginning of the Nepean Gorge, an anticendant entrenched meander caused by the slow uplift during the Blue Mountains orogeny carved down through the fifty-million-year-old Hawkesbury sandstone.

In the 1950s, the building of the Warragamba Dam across the steep gorge of the Warragamba River, the Nepean&#x27;s major tributary, intercepted the flow of the great bulk of its waters and diverted them to meet the needs of the growing Sydney metropolitan area, reducing the river to a shadow of its former self.

These dams and weirs have had a potent effect, blocking migratory native fish like Australian bass (also locally commonly known as perch) from much of their former habitat, and reducing floods and freshets needed for spawning. Nevertheless, the Hawkesbury/Nepean remains an important and popular wild bass fishery.

The luscious banks of the Nepean River provide a natural haven for local flora and fauna and a quiet location for local residents to relax. At Emu Plains, the western bank of the river provides a location for outdoor theatre productions on warm summer nights. The eastern bank at Penrith provides barbecue facilities and children&#x27;s play equipment, as well as a wide pathway running for several kilometres for strolls along the riverbank. The eastern bank is also the home of the Nepean Rowing Club.

Wallacia Mandi, a Mandaeans mandi (temple) in Wallacia, is located on the west bank of the Nepean River. Water from the Nepean River is pumped into baptismal pools at the mandi for ritual purification.

==History==

===Pre-European history===

Aboriginal people used the river regularly, and their fish traps could be seen at Yarramundi before sand and gravel mining redirected the river. Charles Darwin also wrote of people at Emu Ford, commenting on their skill with spears, while Watkin Tench of the Royal Marines also noted their use of spears, lines and nets to capture fish. The people of the Nepean region also regularly traded with people of the western plains via a route that Bell followed when he laid down an alternate route over the mountains, now called Bells Line of Road.

Near Penrith, since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments deposited by the Nepean River 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, according to repeated, revised and corroborated radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating. At first when these results were new they were controversial. More recently in 1987 and 2003 dating of the same sediments strata has revised and corroborated these dates. A great many more artefacts made by people have been found in the region dating back to within the last 5,000 years. Karskens et al. have made an attempt to recover, integrate and map archaeological data of the area from both published and unpublished reports.

===European settlement===

When the British colony was established at Sydney in 1788, the Governor, Captain Arthur Phillip, charted the coast 50 km north to the mouth of the Hawkesbury and around 32 km upstream till they were stopped by a waterfall, most likely at Hawkesbury Heights. Phillip named the river after Lord Hawkesbury, later titled Charles Jenkinson, 1st Earl of Liverpool, President of the Privy Council Standing Committee on Trade.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Watkin Tench set off to walk inland, west of Sydney. About inland, at the foot of the Blue Mountains, he discovered a large river which he named Nepean after Evan Nepean, the Under Secretary of State at the Home Office and a close personal friend of Arthur Phillip. It took about three years to realise that the Nepean flowed into the Hawkesbury.

Nepean river was also one of the pivotal sites of the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, fought between the Kingdom of Great Britain and local aboriginal clans in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

During the 1820s, the Nepean district&#x27;s most famous early settler, the landowner and physician Sir John Jamison (1776–1844), erected a Georgian mansion, called Regentville House, on the model estate which he had established on a rise overlooking the river, not far from the present-day city of Penrith. Jamison is considered one of early Australia&#x27;s most important political and agricultural pioneers. A fire devastated the house in the 1860s.

==Crossings==
Despite forming the effective western and south-western boundary of the metropolitan region of Sydney for its entire length, there are very few fixed crossings of the Nepean River. Going upstream, these comprise:

== Floods in the Nepean district ==
The first flood on record - apparently a small occurrence - was in 1795. Others followed in 1799, March &amp; October 1806 and 1809. In 1810, after a series of major floods on the Hawkesbury, Governor Macquarie proclaimed the ‘Macquarie Towns’ of Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Castlereagh, and Pitt Town in an attempt to ensure that development was restricted to higher ground, free of flooding. The devastation caused by flooding in February 1817 prompted Governor Macquarie to issue a notice exhorting settlers, in the strongest possible terms, to build their residences above the established flood levels.

More flooding occurred in 1857 and twice in 1860, both February and May.

The most devastating flood occurred in June 1867 with the Nepean River estimated to have reached in the river, and AHD. This flood carried away the approaches to the recently built Victoria Bridge. Emu Plains, Castlereagh, and the lower parts of Penrith were all under flood, causing immense loss of property. Many houses were carried into the river by landslides. Many residents were forced to take refuge in public buildings such as the Penrith Hospital and the public schools. A major flood such as that of 1867 would cause inundation of over 16,000 dwellings and damage costing approximately A$1.4 billion.

There have been other notable floods since, particularly that of July 1900 and March 1914. Again there was much flooding of streets and loss of houses and property along the river.

1974 was another significant La Niña flood event.

During the 2021 New South Wales floods, the Nepean River became overflowed, peaking at , with Windsor Bridge submerging in its waters, leading to inundated homes and isolated animals in the surrounds.

== Mandaean ritual use ==
The Australian Mandaean community in the Sydney metropolitan area regularly performs masbuta (baptism) rituals in the Nepean River, typically in and around Wallacia Mandi.

<text>Robert Julius Trumpler (October 2, 1886 – September 10, 1956) was a Swiss-American astronomer.

==Career==
Born in Switzerland in October 2 1886, where Trumpler did initial schooling. Trumpler entered the Universität Zürich but later transferred to the University of Göttingen where he earned his PhD in 1910. In 1915, during World War I, he emigrated to the United States and joined the University of California. He took a position at Allegheny Observatory, and later went to Lick Observatory. In 1921, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1932.

He is most noted for observing that the brightness of the more distant open clusters was lower than expected, and the stars appeared more red. This was explained by the interstellar dust scattered through the galaxy, resulting in the absorption (extinction) of light or interstellar extinction of light.

Trumpler further studied and catalogued open clusters in order to determine the size of the Milky Way galaxy. At first he thought his analysis placed an upper limit on the Milky Way&#x27;s diameter of about 10,000 parsecs with the Sun located somewhat near the center although he later revised this. While cataloguing open clusters, he also devised a system for their classification according to the number of stars observed within them, how concentrated these stars are in the center of the cluster and the range of their apparent brightness. This system, known as the &quot;Trumpler classification&quot;, is still in use today.

==Honors==
The Robert J. Trumpler Award, awarded by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific for an outstanding PhD Thesis in astronomy, is named in his honor.

&quot;The following celestial features are named after him:&quot;
* The crater Trumpler on the Moon.
* Trumpler Crater on Mars.
* &quot;Trumpler classification&quot;, the classification scheme for open clusters.
* &quot;Trumpler catalogue&quot;, the catalogue of open clusters that he compiled.

==Trumpler Classification for open star clusters==
Trumpler&#x27;s classification method for open star clusters is still currently in use by astronomers. It classifies the star cluster according to three features: Degree of concentration, range of magnitude (brightness) for the stars found in the cluster and the number of stars in the cluster. Degree of concentration is given a number from 1 to 4 in Roman numerals (number I indicating a strong central concentration, II indicating little central concentration, III indicates no noticeable concentration and IV little difference from the surrounding stellar population).

Range of magnitude is classified in a scale 1 to 3 and is written in Arabic numerals. Number 1 indicates most stars within the cluster have a very similar apparent brightness. 2 indicates a medium range across the stars in the cluster and 3 indicates a significant difference in brightness, from very bright to very faint stars.

The third feature classifies the number of stars inside the cluster and it uses letters. Letter &quot;&#x27;p&#x27;&quot; indicates a poor cluster, containing less than 50 stars. Letter &quot;&#x27;m&#x27;&quot; indicates a medium amount of 50 to 100 stars. Letter &quot;&#x27;r&#x27;&quot; indicates a rich cluster, containing more than a 100 stars. Finally, the letter &quot;&#x27;n is attributed to all star clusters where some sort of nebulosity is present. For example, NGC 5460 is classified as a II3m, an open cluster with little central concentration, significant difference in brightness among its stars and 50 to 100 stars within the cluster. Since no nebulosity is detected, the letter n&quot;&#x27; is not attributed to it.

==Notable objects==

Some notable objects from his 1930 catalogue of open clusters are:
* Trumpler 2
* Trumpler 14
* Trumpler 15
* Trumpler 16
* Trumpler 27

<doc id="718997" wikidata="Q2082275" url="?curid=718997" title="Sinister Six">
<text>The Sinister Six are a group of supervillains in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, mainly those featuring Spider-Man. The members are drawn from the character&#x27;s list of enemies, with the original members forming the team in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #1 (October 1964). Led by Doctor Octopus (introduced in issue #3), the team in its premiere followed swiftly the very early appearances of many of the most enduring members of Spider-Man&#x27;s rogues gallery: the Vulture (issue #2), the Sandman (issue #4), Electro (issue #9), Mysterio (issue #13), and Kraven the Hunter (issue #15). While Doctor Octopus has generally remained its leader, the Sinister Six has had multiple variations of composition.

The team has been adapted into various forms of media, mainly in animated series and video games.

==Publication history==

The Sinister Six first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #1 (January 1964).

==Fictional team biography==
===Original Sinister Six===
After suffering two defeats from Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus is separated from his tentacle pack. After his tentacle pack breaks free and helps Doctor Octopus get out of prison, he contacts every known supervillain who had crossed paths with Spider-Man. Only Electro, Kraven the Hunter, the original Mysterio, the Sandman, and the original Vulture respond. As none of the members are willing to relinquish the honor of killing Spider-Man themselves, they decide to challenge Spider-Man individually with the order in which they face him determined by a random drawing. The Sinister Six kidnap Aunt May and &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; secretary Betty Brant, holding them hostage in order to force Spider-Man to confront them. Spider-Man defeats the Sinister Six members one-by-one, mocking their decision to battle him individually instead of as a team in front of Doctor Octopus, the last one to be defeated.

===&quot;The Return of the Sinister Six&quot;===
In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #334–339, Doctor Octopus recruits Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, and Vulture, along with the demonic Hobgoblin (since Kraven the Hunter had recently died), as part of his plan to take over the world. However, this was a trick, part of a larger plan by which Doc Ock alone would be the master of the world, by releasing a chemical into the atmosphere that would cause pain in anyone who attempted to use cocaine; he would then sell his cure for the chemical to the rich and powerful. Sandman, who at this point in his career had reformed and was blackmailed into joining, aids Spider-Man in defeating the Sinister Six, and ultimately stopping Doc Ock&#x27;s plans to conquer the world. Because Octopus&#x27; chemical is eating away the ozone layer, Spider-Man has no choice but to release the cure into the atmosphere.

===&quot;Revenge of the Sinister Six&quot;===
In &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #18-23, Electro, Mysterio, Vulture, and Hobgoblin reunite in a bid to take revenge on Doctor Octopus. To trick Sandman into joining them, they hit his foster family with a bomb, leading him to believe Doctor Octopus attacked them as punishment for betraying him. Sandman contacts Spider-Man and asks him to shadow the group as insurance against him being double-crossed. Doctor Octopus easily defeats the other members of the six with his newly reacquired adamantium arms, then zaps Sandman with a weapon that transforms his body into glass and beats Spider-Man nearly to death. When police surround the building, the other members of the Sinister Six agree to serve Doctor Octopus in exchange for his helping them escape. The assembled Sinister Six go off on a rampage, stealing advanced weapons and technology from several sources, including an alien dimension and a facility specializing in cybernetics. To again complete their quorum of six, they recruit Gog. Eventually, Spider-Man and several other heroes (including the Ghost Rider, Deathlok, Nova, the Hulk, and Solo) confront the villains as they are seizing a HYDRA base to gain access to deadly, world-devastating weapons. Most of the members are again incarcerated, but Vulture and Hobgoblin escape.

===Sinister Seven===
A variation known as the Sinister Seven is formed by Hobgoblin to fight Kaine after he killed Doctor Octopus and the Grim Hunter (Kraven&#x27;s son Vladimir). Hobgoblin&#x27;s Sinister Seven includes the Beetle, Electro, Mysterio, Scorpia, the Shocker, and the Vulture. They finally find Kaine and a battle erupts. Spider-Man saves Kaine from being executed; the two then work together and defeat the Sinister Seven.

===Sandman&#x27;s Sinister Six===
Eventually, the Sandman (who had been turned back into a villain by his former ally the Wizard) and the second Mysterio (the original had committed suicide following his fight with Daredevil) form a new version of the Sinister Six, with Venom temporarily replacing Doctor Octopus and the other members consisting of Electro, the second Kraven the Hunter (another son of the dead original), and the Vulture. The Sandman uses the Sinister Six in order to get revenge on Doctor Octopus for turning him into glass in &quot;The Revenge of the Sinister Six&quot; storyline. The Sinister Six are defeated again, and Venom subsequently attacks the various members of the group after being betrayed by them. He nearly kills the Sandman and badly injures Electro and Kraven the Hunter before he and his symbiote are briefly separated from each other by the mysterious Senator Ward.

===Sinister Twelve===

In &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man&quot;, Norman Osborn is unmasked to the public as the Green Goblin and imprisoned. Osborn contacts a group of supervillains who also bear grudges against Spider-Man, all of whom had been financed by Osborn&#x27;s fortunes for years. Eager to retaliate, the villains agree to band together, and the Sinister Twelve is formed.

Mac Gargan is the de facto leader of the Twelve while Osborn is in prison, and he kidnaps Peter Parker&#x27;s Aunt May and threatens to kill her if Spider-Man does not help Osborn escape from jail. Spider-Man, with help from Black Cat, breaks Osborn out only to be confronted by the Vulture, the Sandman, Electro, the Chameleon, the Lizard, Hydro-Man, the Shocker, Hammerhead, Boomerang and Tombstone. Osborn, now in the guise of the Goblin, introduces them as the Sinister Twelve.

Spider-Man and Black Cat are rescued by Captain America, Iron Man, Daredevil, Yellowjacket and the Fantastic Four. Furious, Goblin rockets away and kidnaps Mary Jane Watson and Spider-Man pursues him. Spider-Man and the Goblin clash upon a bridge (not the one where Gwen Stacy was killed). Finally, Osborn gives a vital clue as to Aunt May&#x27;s whereabouts before being knocked into the river below. In the aftermath, Aunt May is found and saved. The rest of the Sinister Twelve are subdued by the other heroes and arrested.

===Civil War&#x27;s Sinister Six===
A new version of the Sinister Six apparently bands together during the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. The line-up consists of Doctor Octopus, Grim Reaper, Lizard, Shocker, Trapster and Vulture. They are stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers off-panel and discovered bound and subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===&quot;Big Time&quot; Sinister Six===
Following the events of the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline which involves Doctor Octopus assembling Spider-Man&#x27;s enemies into targeting Harry Osborn&#x27;s baby (who Doctor Octopus thought had some of Norman Osborn&#x27;s DNA), only the Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Rhino, and the Sandman remain with Doctor Octopus to reform the Sinister Six when the baby does not inherit Norman Osborn&#x27;s DNA. Their first plot involves sending Micro-Octobots to blow up an Air Force base. This is prevented by Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.

Spider-Man and the Future Foundation stumble on a plot on a Caribbean Island by the Sinister Six which involves the use of a zombie pirate crew. During the fight with the Sinister Six, Spider-Man realizes that the Doctor Octopus, Electro, Rhino and Sandman that they are fighting are robots, while Mysterio and the Chameleon are the only real ones present. Meanwhile, the real Doctor Octopus infiltrates the Baxter Building to look for specific technology plans.

While the adult Avengers are dealing with the eruption of Mount Etna, Tigra and the Avengers Academy students learn that Electro has broken into a French laboratory. Once on the scene, the students discover that Electro is accompanied by the rest of the Sinister Six. The Sinister Six overpower the students and Doctor Octopus steals a device containing self-sustaining power. Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six later fight the Intelligencia where the Chameleon had infiltrated the group disguised as Klaw. After the Intelligencia members are defeated, the Sinister Six steal their Zero Cannon (a weapon which changes Earth&#x27;s gravity field to send specific objects into space). Doctor Octopus later appears in a robot suit which would help to keep him alive.

Doctor Octopus and Mysterio coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station and taken over some of the crew members. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. When Spider-Man arrives on the Apogee 1 Space Station, Doctor Octopus pushes a button that starts to move the Apogee 1 Space Station close to Earth. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, the Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.

====Ends of the Earth====
In the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, all of Doctor Octopus&#x27; preparations come to fruition in a plan to conquer the world. Doctor Octopus activates a giant antenna array called the &quot;Octahedral&quot; which, in turn, activates Earth-orbiting satellites he calls the &quot;Octavian Lens&quot;. The Lens works to speed up the greenhouse effect, which in turn heats up the Earth. Upon hacking into televisions around the world, Doctor Octopus describes what his satellites are doing, and shuts them down. He says he can save the world &quot;at a price&quot;. At Palazzo Senatorio, an international gathering of world leaders and the planet&#x27;s greatest minds meet to discuss Doctor Octopus&#x27;s supposed offer to save the world. The Avengers crash the assembly and Spider-Man captures the Chameleon, who is at the meeting disguised as Vice President Al Gore. Spider-Man lets the Chameleon go, but he secretly places a Spider-Tracer on him, which allows Spider-Man and the Avengers to follow the Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coast where the rest of the Sinister Six is waiting. The Six subdue the Avengers, leaving only Spider-Man standing. Spider-Man is taken down when trying to gain control of Doctor Octopus&#x27;s tentacles with his helmet.

The Sinister Six then leave the area, and Doctor Octopus issues his demands: control of 200 missile facilities (for use in his plan), as well as 2 billion dollars for each of the members of the Sinister Six. In response, Spider-Man contacts Horizon Labs for help. Doctor Octopus sends the Sandman to guard one of the missile facilities in the Sahara Desert. After Spider-Man, the Black Widow, and Silver Sable enter the facility and defeat the Sandman, Doctor Octopus contacts the U.N. once again and orders them to kill Spider-Man in retaliation. In a subsequent missile facility raid, Spider-Man and his allies manage to defeat the Rhino, but they are unable to capture him because they are attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D (under orders from the U.N., via Doctor Octopus&#x27;s demands). Forced to flee, Spider-Man and his allies then attempt to rally support from Earth&#x27;s other heroes after the Titanium Man alerts them to the fact that Doctor Octopus has been recruiting other villains. Tracking down a final facility, Spider-Man learns that Doctor Octopus has already launched all of his satellites. However, this is revealed to be a deception created by Mysterio and the Chameleon. Spider-Man defeats the Chameleon when he attempts to attack them in a &quot;Doc-Ock&quot; suit of armor. Spider-Man and his allies then convince Mysterio to help them track down Doctor Octopus&#x27;s base. While they find the base, they also find themselves pitted against the &#x27;new&#x27; Sinister Six—in the form of the mind-controlled Avengers.

Despite Doctor Octopus&#x27;s confidence, the heroes prevail against their mind-controlled teammates; the Black Widow and Hawkeye are knocked out by Iron Man while he is still under Doctor Octopus&#x27;s control. Spider-Man&#x27;s new training, combined with Captain America subconsciously holding back, allows Spider-Man and Silver Sable to defeat Spider-Woman and Captain America, respectively. Finally, Mysterio uses an EMP generator to negate the Octobots controlling Thor, Iron Man and the Red Hulk. Now &quot;Octobot&quot; free, these remaining three Avengers set out to take out Doctor Octopus&#x27;s missiles, while Spider-Man and Silver Sable confront Doctor Octopus in his base. The two are first met by the Rhino, who decides to drown himself and take Sable with him in an attempt to psychologically beat Spider-Man into submission, but Spider-Man musters his strength, manages to destroy Doctor Octopus&#x27;s arms and equipment and ultimately hauls his foe away to a doctor.

===&quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;″s Sinister Six===
As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) encounters a new Sinister Six consisting of Boomerang, Overdrive, the Shocker, the Speed Demon, the Living Brain and the female Beetle that previously fought Captain America and the Black Widow. The group of villains attacks Horizon Labs, but the Superior Spider-Man defeats them, using a power-dampening field to disable their equipment. He is preparing to kill Boomerang when the still-living consciousness of Peter Parker stops him. Otto gives the villains to the NYPD and the EMTs upon their arrival.

This version of the Sinister Six (minus the Living Brain) then appears in its own series &quot;The Superior Foes of Spider-Man&quot;. The Sinister Six later assaulted the Owl&#x27;s base. Overdrive and the Speed Demon were captured by the Owl and interrogated. The Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them while covertly dialing for back-up. Unimpressed, the Owl got ready to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone (who was revealed to be the Beetle&#x27;s father). At one point to steal valuables from the Chameleon, including a portrait of Doctor Doom, the Sinister Six allied with the Owl, where they expand the group into a &quot;Sinister Sixteen&quot;. Besides Boomerang, the Beetle, Overdrive, the Owl, and the Speed Demon, the group consists of the Armadillo, the Bi-Beast, the Clown, the Cyclone, the Human Fly, the Kangaroo, Man Mountain Marko, the Mirage, Scorcher, Shriek, the Spot and the Squid. The team eventually broke up after Boomerang had thoroughly screwed over everyone, including himself.

====Superior Six====
Following the deletion of Peter Parker&#x27;s memories and acquiring the Raft as his new base which he renamed Spider-Island II, the Superior Spider-Man begins to collect former Sinister Six members and store them in his underwater lab with the implied intention to create a new team as the Superior Spider-Man. First, he acquired the sand grain that contained the Sandman&#x27;s consciousness. When Electro returned to Earth after being hurled into space by Thor, the Superior Spider-Man enlisted Thor to help defeat Electro. The Superior Spider-Man then confiscated the Chameleon from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. The Superior Spider-Man came across Mysterion (a villain that is dressed like Mysterio) robbing the bank. Upon defeating Mysterion, the Superior Spider-Man discovered that the villain he thought was Mysterio was not Quentin Beck, but an unnamed man who bought the Mysterio gear from the Hobgoblin. Finally, the Superior Spider-Man went up against the Vulture, who seeks to get even with the Superior Spider-Man for beating him up twice. The Superior Spider-Man managed to defeat the Vulture.

The Superior Spider-Man debuts with mind-controlled members as the supposedly-reformed &quot;Superior Six&quot; at the time when Lightmaster invades Alchemax to obtain an invention that would work in sync with his own light powers. The Superior Six ended up fighting the Wrecking Crew (who were hired by Lightmaster to assist him). Due to the second Sun Girl&#x27;s widespread attack, the Superior Spider-Man lost control of the Superior Six and they attacked him. The Superior Spider-Man and Sun Girl had to team up to defeat them.

====Sinister Sixty-Six====
Mojo and the Chameleon abduct Spider-Man and his X-Men students and force them to star in a show which pits them against the Sinister Sixty-Six.

====Swarm&#x27;s Sinister Six====
Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning encounter the eighth incarnation of the Sinister Six led by Swarm and consisting of the third 8-Ball, Delilah, Killer Shrike, the third Melter and the Squid. After Hellion defeated Swarm, the other members of the Sinister Six surrendered.

===Iron Spider&#x27;s Sinister Six===
Purchasing a recolored and modified version of the Iron Spider armor, Miles Morales&#x27; uncle Aaron Davis forms his incarnation of the Sinister Six consisting of Bombshell, the Francine Frye version of Electro, the Roderick Kingsley version of the Hobgoblin, Sandman, and Spot. Their first mission was to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.

===Sinister Sixty===
Spider-Man plays with a cancer patient named Nathan, where they envision that Nathan becomes Spider-Bite and they &quot;fight&quot; the Stilt-Man&#x27;s Sinister Sixty who wish to obtain Spider-Bite&#x27;s action figure of Spider-Man. The line-up consists of the Absorbing Man, the Big Man, the Black Cat, the Black Tarantula, Boomerang, Calypso, Carrion, Carnage, the Chameleon, the Demogoblin, Doctor Octopus, the Doppelganger, Electro, the Enforcers, Fusion, the Green Goblin, the Grey Goblin, Hammerhead, the Hobgoblin, Hydro-Man, Jack O&#x27;Lantern, the Jackal, Joystick, the Juggernaut, Kaine, the Kingpin, Kraven the Hunter, Kraven the Hunter II, Kraven the Hunter III, Lady Octopus, the Lizard, Mephisto, Mister Negative, the Molten Man, Morbius the Living Vampire, Morlun, Mysterio, the Raptor, the Rhino, the Sandman, Sasha Kravinoff, Scorpia, the Scorpion, Scream, Screwball, the Shocker, Shriek, Silvermane, the Sin-Eater, Alistair Smythe, Stunner, Swarm, the Tarantula, Venom, Vermin, and the Vulture. Spider-Man and Spider-Bite defeat the Sinister Sixty at Grand Central Station and keep the Stilt-Man from claiming the Spider-Man action figure.

===Sinister War===
While Doctor Octopus is discovering clues to some of his missing memories, he exhumes an unexpectedly empty casket in a cemetery. Kindred sends one of his centipedes to enter Doctor Octopus&#x27; ear, rendering him unconscious.

In a lead-up to &quot;Sinister War&quot;, Kindred tells Doctor Octopus that he can help him with his memories, but he will need to gather five more people. At an unknown beach, Doctor Octopus helps Sandman with his loss of direction and promises to solve Sandman&#x27;s immortality problem. Upon building a special machine, Doctor Octopus resurrects Electro with his powers intact as Kindred comments on Electro&#x27;s abilities while stating that Doctor Octopus is getting closer to his true self. Doctor Octopus and Electro find Kraven the Hunter in the Savage Land hunting a dinosaur. Electro shocks the dinosaur, and Doctor Octopus recruits Kraven the Hunter into the Sinister Six by promising him to hunt down the Lizard. Doctor Octopus coerces Curt Connors into using the Isotope Genome Accelerator on himself which separates him from his Lizard side. Kindred then completes the Sinister Six by having Mysterio join him as Kindred notes that his endgame with Spider-Man is approaching.

When the Savage Six attacks the world premiere of a film that Mary Jane Watson and a disguised Mysterio were involved in, the Sinister Six intervenes in order to get Mysterio in their ranks despite Spider-Man&#x27;s intervention. Mysterio complies with Doctor Octopus and teleports Mary Jane away while Doctor Octopus knocks out Spider-Man. Kindred kept the Savage Six on the reserve should the Foreigner&#x27;s group, the Superior Foes, and the Sinister Syndicate fail to eliminate Spider-Man. Badly wounded, Peter is relieved to find the Black Cat, Wolverine, and the Human Torch have arrived to help, unaware that they are Mysterio, the Lizard, and Electro in illusion disguises created by the former. The Lizard springs their trap too early by attacking Peter, much to Mysterio&#x27;s annoyance. Peter fends off the Sinister Six until Doctor Octopus ensnares him with his tentacles. Peter attempts to appeal to Doctor Octopus&#x27; better nature, telling him that he is not like this anymore. Doctor Octopus briefly hesitates, but mounting pressure from the rest of the Sinister Six compels him to act, though this buys Peter enough time to break free. The Savage Six then attack the Sinister Six, giving Peter time to escape. Ultimately, Doctor Octopus knocks all the other villains out using Black Ant&#x27;s technology when he determines that Kindred planted some of his centipedes in the brains of every villain present, Octavius declaring that he dislikes being used even if he declines to help Peter further.

===Film===
====&quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series====
In December 2013, Sony announced two spin-offs of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; franchise, &quot;The Sinister Six&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot;, with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct the former. Throughout the live-action film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, a line-up for the team was teased. During the end credits, weapons and technology belonging to the Rhino, the Vulture, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and Kraven the Hunter were revealed, confirming them as members, with the Green Goblin serving as the leader. However, this line-up is left to be debated as Goddard stated he wanted to adopt a more classic adaptation of the group which would have included Sandman and Doc Ock as the leader. The film was said to be a redemption story for the characters, and would probably not feature Spider-Man. As the Sinister Six&#x27;s original goal, however, was to kill him, there would seem to be a chance that he would appear. The film was originally scheduled for release on November 11, 2016. However, following the announcement in February 2015 of a new Spider-Man franchise with Marvel Studios, the spin-offs were postponed and eventually canceled.

====Marvel Cinematic Universe====

In an email from Amy Pascal leaked during the Sony Pictures hack, Pascal revealed that she planned for Tom Holland&#x27;s Spider-Man to appear in a &quot;Sinister Six&quot; film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dependent on the success of the then-upcoming licensing agreement with Marvel Studios.

====Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe====

Following the collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, many spin-offs that had been in development before were revived, with the first of these, the live-action film &quot;Venom&quot;, being released on October 5, 2018. Sony&#x27;s December 2013 plans for their own expanded universe included a film based on the Sinister Six, with Drew Goddard attached to write and potentially direct. Goddard was confirmed to be directing the film in April 2014. The film was believed to have been canceled by November 2015 when Sony was focusing on its new reboot with Marvel. In October 2018, Goddard acknowledged that his script could eventually be used for a film. By December of the same year, producer Amy Pascal confirmed that the studio intends to use the script in an upcoming project and expressed the company&#x27;s desire for the filmmaker to direct the film as well.

In the post-credits scene of &quot;Morbius&quot; (2022), Adrian Toomes from the MCU approaches Dr. Michael Morbius in an effort to form a team. The team is intended to be the Sinister Six, with director Daniel Espinosa expressing interest in having Norman Osborn be part of the group.

Following the financial failures of &quot;Madame Web&quot; and &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot;, and the underperformance of &quot;&quot;, it was announced that Sony would cease making spin-off films that did not feature Spider-Man, most likely including this film.

<doc id="718998" wikidata="Q3314300" url="?curid=718998" title="Millennium (novel)">
<text>Millennium is a 1983 science fiction novel by John Varley. Varley later turned this novel into the script for the 1989 film &quot;Millennium&quot;, both of which are based on Varley&#x27;s short story &quot;Air Raid&quot;, which was published in 1977.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Millennium&quot; features a civilization that has dubbed itself &quot;The Last Age&quot;. Due to millennia of warfare of every type (nineteen nuclear wars alone), the Earth has been heavily polluted and humanity&#x27;s gene pool irreparably damaged. They have thus embarked on a desperate plan; time travel into the past, collect healthy humans, and send them to an uncontaminated planet to rebuild civilization.

The time travelers can only take people that will have no further effect on the timeline: those who have vanished without a trace, or died without being observed; otherwise they would be changing the past, which risks a temporal paradox and perhaps even a catastrophic breakdown of the fabric of time. Though they collect everyone they can, they exert a great deal of effort on those destined to die in various disasters such as sinking ships and crashing airplanes (and once a century of Roman soldiers lost and dying in the North African desert). As such incidents leave no survivors to report interference and change the timeline, they can freely remove the living but soon-to-die victims, and replace them with convincing corpses they have manufactured in the future.

The novel deals with several of the raids, their eventual discovery in the present day, and the fallout that results from changes to the present day reverberating into the future.

The story follows Louise Baltimore, who is in charge of a &quot;snatch team&quot; that goes back into the past to kidnap people who would otherwise die. Because of the massive pollution and the genetic damage she has sustained, she is missing one leg and must get advanced medical treatment daily. Her natural appearance is quite ugly due to skin damage (from &quot;paraleprosy&quot;) and other problems; however, she wears a special &quot;skin suit&quot; which makes her look whole and beautiful (which may or may not be real—she is an unreliable narrator), and gives her a functional artificial leg.

The team she leads uses a &quot;time gate&quot; to appear in the bathroom aboard an airplane in flight. Dressed to look like flight attendants, they begin to bluff the passengers into entering the bathroom where they are pushed into the gate, to arrive in the future. After large numbers of people disappear, the remaining passengers become suspicious. The future team then uses special weapons to stun them before throwing them through the gate.

During the removal of the passengers, they run into an unexpected hijacker. The ensuing gunplay is one-sided; one of the snatch team members is killed, and her stunner is lost. The rest of the team finishes removing the passengers and the real flight attendants. The team then scatters pre-burnt body parts around the plane so they will be found after the crash. As the plane approaches the moment when it is destined to crash, the lost weapon still has not been found.

Upon returning to her present (our future), Louise is informed that the weapon that was left behind has caused a paradox and that it must be recovered to prevent a breakdown in the fabric of time.

==Miscellaneous information==
Most of the chapter titles are named after famous novels and short stories about time travel by other authors, as Varley mentions in the book&#x27;s author&#x27;s note: &quot;The time-travel story has a long history in science fiction. The theme has been so extensively explored, in fact, that I found it no trouble to write a book with chapter titles borrowed almost exclusively from the long list of stories that served, in one way or another, as ancestors to this one.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

John Varley worked on numerous drafts of a screenplay for over ten years and half a dozen directors until it was finally filmed by Michael Anderson in 1989. As of July 2014, the film holds a 13% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Millennium&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #15 and commented that &quot;&quot;Millennium&quot; is old-fashioned, seamless science fiction. One gets the feeling that all is done well, but most of it has been done before. Does this mean one shouldn&#x27;t buy it? By no means. There is certainly little enough well-written old-fashioned science fiction being published.&quot;

It was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1983, and for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1984.

<doc id="718999" wikidata="Q2297915" url="?curid=718999" title="Soho Manufactory">
<text>The Soho Manufactory () was an early factory which pioneered mass production on the assembly line principle, in Soho, Birmingham, England, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It operated from 1766–1848 and was demolished in 1853.

==Beginnings==

In 1756, Edward Ruston leased land on Handsworth Heath from the Lord of the Manor. He deepened Hockley Brook, and built a rolling mill powered by it.

In 1761 (or 1764) the &quot;toy&quot; manufacturer Matthew Boulton and his business partner John Fothergill leased the site including a cottage and the mill. The mill was replaced by a new factory, designed and built by the Wyatt family of Lichfield, and completed in 1766. The cottage was later demolished and Boulton&#x27;s home (Soho House) was built on the site, also by the Wyatts.

==Production==

The Manufactory produced a wide range of goods from buttons, buckles and boxes to japanned ware (collectively called &quot;toys&quot;), and later luxury products such as silverware and ormolu (a type of gilded bronze).

===Steam engines===
In 1782, it became the first site with a Watt steam engine with the sun and planet gear. It was also home to the first steam-powered mint, whose presses were subsequently used at the first Birmingham Mint.

==Later==
In later years, the Manufactory was served by canal at Soho Wharf, at the end of the short Soho Branch of the Birmingham Canal Navigations&#x27; Soho Loop.

The manufactory was demolished in 1853 and the site subsequently used for housing.

==Cultural references==
In the 1990s the television archaeology programme &quot;Time Team&quot; excavated the foundations, in some of the local back gardens. (Series 4, Ep. 3, 1997)
The Manufactory is featured on the Bank of England £50 note along with Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and the Whitbread Engine.

<text>Deewaar ( &quot;The Wall&quot;) is a 1975 Indian action crime film written by Salim–Javed and directed by Yash Chopra. The film stars Shashi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan, alongside an ensemble cast of Neetu Singh, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, Iftekhar, Madan Puri, Satyen Kappu and Manmohan Krishna. The music was composed by R. D. Burman, while cinematography and editing were handled by Kay Gee Koregaonkar and T. R. Mangeshkar-Pran Mehra. In the film, two impoverished brothers struggle to survive in the slums of Mumbai and eventually find themselves on opposing sides of the law. The film&#x27;s title signifies the wall that springs up between the two brothers, drawn apart by fate and circumstances in a time of socio-political turmoil.

&quot;Deewaar&quot; was released worldwide on 24 January 1975 to critical acclaim and praise for its story, script, music cast performances (especially Bachchan, Kapoor and Roy). The film was commercially successful and is considered a ground-breaking cinematic masterpiece, with &quot;India Times&quot; ranking &quot;Deewaar&quot; amongst the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. It is also one of three Hindi-language films to be included on the list of &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

The film had a significant impact not only on Indian cinema but also on Indian society; its anti-establishment themes and Bachchan&#x27;s anti-hero vigilante character resonated with audiences. The movie cemented Bachchan&#x27;s popular image as the &#x27;Angry young man&#x27; of Bollywood cinema. &quot;Forbes India&quot; included Bachchan&#x27;s performance in the film on its list of &quot;25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema&quot;. The film also cemented the success of Salim–Javed, who went on to write more blockbuster films; their value skyrocketed and they were being paid as well as the leading actors of the time. &quot;Deewaar&quot;″s influence also extends to world cinema, influencing films from Hong Kong and British cinema.

== Plot ==
Anand Verma resides in a modest home with his wife Sumitra and their two young sons Vijay and Ravi. He is a principled and well-respected trade union leader, who leads struggling labourers on a strike as they are depending on him to better their lives with concessions from their owner Badri Prasad. However, Prasad retaliates by kidnapping Anand&#x27;s family and forcing him to sign a contract giving away the labourers&#x27; rights, in order to save his family&#x27;s lives. When the striking labourers learn about Anand&#x27;s actions, they all curse him and thrash him nearly to death, unaware that Anand was blackmailed to do so. The labourers even persecute Anand&#x27;s family, and some of them drunkenly capture Vijay and tattoo his left arm with the Hindi words &quot;मेरा बाप चोर है&quot; (English: &quot;My father is a thief&quot;) and . Unable to bear the humiliation, Anand escapes from the town and decides to spend his remaining life aimlessly traveling in trains, abandoning his family for whom he had abandoned his principles and ideals. In desperation, Sumitra brings Vijay and Ravi to Mumbai and resorts to low-wage manual labour to raise her sons as a single mother. Their home is on the footpath under a huge bridge that is home to millions of homeless urban poor.

As Vijay and Ravi grow up in the slums of Mumbai, Vijay has an acute awareness of his father&#x27;s humiliation, for he has been victimized for his father&#x27;s supposed misdeeds, and is reminded of his past by the ever-present tattoo on his arm. He also refuses to enter a temple, stating that he wishes to chart his own destiny and not beg for it from the deities. Vijay starts out as a shoeshiner and later becomes a shipyard labourer in his youth, sacrificing his own education in order to enable Ravi to study. On the other hand, Ravi is a perfect citizen and is unwavering in his commitment to law and righteousness. Although all his attempts at receiving a job are in vain, Ravi romances Veera, the daughter of DCP Narang, by whom he is sent for police training and soon earns the rank of Sub-Inspector. In the process of fighting for his rights, Vijay refuses to pay the weekly extortion to the henchmen of the shipyard owner Samant, who is a merciless crime lord. Vijay proceeds to thrash several of Samant&#x27;s henchmen, and a disappointed Sumitra berates him due to this. Vijay sarcastically asks her whether she expects him &quot;also&quot; to escape like a coward, implying that he criticises his father&#x27;s actions, causing a perturbed Sumitra to slap Vijay and half-heartedly defend Anand. However, this event influences one of Samant&#x27;s rivals, Mulk Raj Daavar, to hire Vijay to protect his smuggled gold bullion that has been thrice hijacked by Samant. Vijay sells the information to Samant to help him hijack the gold bullion, takes the money from Samant, then captures the gold bullion from his warehouse and hands it over to Daavar, who rewards Vijay with a huge sum of money, allowing him to purchase a palatial home for his family.

Meanwhile, DCP Narang provides Ravi his first assignment to apprehend and arrest some of the hardcore criminals and smugglers in Mumbai, which also include Daavar and Vijay. Ravi is shocked for having never associated his brother with criminal activities, and must now decide between apprehending Vijay and quitting the police force. Later, Ravi shoots an impoverished boy Chander in the leg non-fatally in an attempt to arrest him for committing theft, only to find out that Chander had stolen only some bread for his family. After admitting Chander to a hospital under police custody, a remorseful Ravi visits his home, offering his family some food and confessing his action, but Chander&#x27;s enraged mother berates Ravi and accuses him of colluding with the state in protecting those who store goods in warehouses, and hunting down petty thieves trying to feed their starving families. However, Chander&#x27;s father, who is a retired schoolteacher, forgives Ravi and justifies the shooting by stating that the stealing no matter of a lakh or of a penny is a crime, and that all criminals should be treated equally and it would lead to anarchy if all the poor and needy resort to the same life. After hearing both sides from Chander&#x27;s parents, Ravi, who was initially reluctant to act against his own brother, is finally motivated to agree to take his case from DCP Narang. 

When Ravi investigates that Vijay has acquired wealth overnight by crime, he confronts Vijay and orders him to surrender himself to the police. However, Vijay refuses to do so, citing all the injustice caused to him and his family. Nevertheless, Ravi decides to leave the house purchased by him and go to live in his police quarters. Sumitra too is disgusted with Vijay and chooses to live with Ravi, even refusing to accept Vijay&#x27;s gift of the high-rise apartment where she had once worked as a manual labourer. Ravi then completes his task assigned by DCP Narang and arrests many henchmen from the gangs of Samant, Davaar and Vijay (including Daavar himself), causing a feud to develop between Vijay and Ravi. Shouldering past the loss of his mother and brother and many of his associates, Vijay enters into an intimate relationship with Anita, a prostitute whom he meets at a bar. Around the same time, Anand&#x27;s dead body is discovered inside a train and his funeral is performed by Vijay. Anita advises Vijay to erase the tattoo on his arm through plastic surgery, but Vijay states that doing so cannot erase the words on the tattoo from his heart and soul. Meanwhile, Sumitra falls terminally ill and Vijay is also unable to visit her at the hospital due to the police appointed by Ravi to arrest him. A furious Vijay enters the temple for the first time, and confronts the deity for punishing him at the cost of his faithful mother. As a result, Sumitra miraculously recovers from her terminal illness, much to Ravi and Veera&#x27;s happiness. 

Later, Vijay learns that Anita is pregnant with his illegitimate child and decides to abandon his life in the underworld, so that he can marry Anita, surrender himself to the police and seek forgiveness from Sumitra and Ravi, not wanting their unborn son to be scarred the way he was. He also calls Sumitra and asks her to arrive at the temple to give him blessings. Despite this, things take a drastic turn when Samant and his remaining henchmen arrive and thrash Anita to death in revenge. After an emotional moment, Anita dies in the arms of Vijay, who retaliates by brutally murdering Samant and his remaining henchmen, thus branding himself a criminal forever. Ravi learns about the deaths of Samant and his henchmen, and when the two brothers meet for a final clash at the crime scene, Ravi pleads with Vijay to stop running and surrender himself, and ends up shooting him in the arm and heart fatally. After getting hit by the gunshot, a gravely injured and dying Vijay uses a car to escape from Ravi and crashes it into the wall of the temple, where he reunites with Sumitra and pleads forgiveness. Vijay then dies in Sumitra&#x27;s arms, leaving her extremely shattered, just as Ravi arrives at the temple and is completely distraught over what he did to Vijay. The film ends with a scene of DCP Narang and the police awarding Ravi, along with Veera and Sumitra for his successful pursuit of justice, though Ravi is still filled with remorse for killing Vijay.

== Production ==

=== Story and screenplay ===
The film&#x27;s screenplay, story and dialogues were written by Salim–Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar). The main inspiration for the plot was the film &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; (1961), starring Dilip Kumar, which had a similar premise of two brothers on opposing sides of the law, with the elder criminal brother as the main character. &quot;Deewaar&quot; is thus considered to be a spiritual successor to &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot;. Salim–Javed credited &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; as well as Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) as the main inspirations for &quot;Deewaar&quot;, which they described as a &quot;more urban, much more contemporary&quot; take on their themes; while &quot;Mother India&quot; and &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; took place in a rural context, Salim–Javed reinterpreted their themes in a contemporary urban context with &quot;Deewaar&quot;.

Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character, Vijay, was loosely inspired by the real-life Mumbai underworld gangster Haji Mastan. Vijay&#x27;s story arc in the film parallels that of Mastan&#x27;s life, such as the rise from a humble dockyard porter to a powerful smuggler, and Mastan&#x27;s rivalry with smuggler Sukkur Narayan Bakhia is similar to Vijay&#x27;s rivalry with Samant (Madan Puri).

Salim–Javed&#x27;s screenplay had dynamic dialogues and incorporated a number of symbolic motifs. For example, the scene where the two brothers meet as adults takes place under a bridge, symbolizing a bridge forming between the brothers. Set in the Dharavi slums of Mumbai, the film&#x27;s story of gangsters in Dharavi was a critique of socio-political inequality and injustice in Mumbai. The characterisations of the two brothers are sociologically contextualised to represent a form of urban conflict and drama, aimed at presenting a causal explanation for the sequence of events and Vijay&#x27;s social alienation, with the narrative explaining his every action and decision, grounded in his memories and experiences.

The script generally has an atmosphere of secularism, while incorporating subtle religious motifs. The mother Sumitra (Nirupa Roy) and police brother Ravi (Shashi Kapoor) are religious Hindus, whereas the criminal brother Vijay (Bachchan) is generally not religious and &quot;upset with God&quot;, yet he carries a badge numbered 786 which his Muslim co-worker, Rahim Chacha (Yunus Parvez), points out to be a number of religious significance in Islam (representing &quot;Bismillah&quot;) and has its own subplot. The 786 badge plays a powerful and symbolic role in several scenes, saving Vijay at key moments and signifying something ominous when he loses it.

Salim–Javed initially showed the script to Bachchan, whom they had in mind for Vijay&#x27;s role after having worked with him on &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973). At the time, Bachchan was working on another film with Yash Chopra, and told him about the script. After some initial scepticism, Chopra was eventually convinced to direct the film after Salim–Javed narrated the storyline to him.

=== Casting and filming ===
Bachchan&#x27;s &quot;angry young man&quot; performance as Vijay in the film was inspired by Dilip Kumar&#x27;s intense performance as Gunga in &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot;, which Bachchan sharpened and reinterpreted in a contemporary urban context reflecting the changing socio-political climate of 1970s India.

Salim–Javed &quot;felt only Bachchan could do justice to Vijay&#x27;s role.&quot; According to Akhtar, they &quot;saw his talent, which most makers didn&#x27;t. He was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren&#x27;t good.&quot; At Salim–Javed&#x27;s insistence, Bachchan was cast in the role. Director Yash Chopra&#x27;s first choices for Vijay and Ravi&#x27;s roles were Dev Anand and Rajesh Khanna respectively. After Anand rejected the script, casting plans changed and Khanna was to play Vijay and Navin Nischol was considered for Ravi. However, Salim–Javed had Amitabh Bachchan and Shatrughan Sinha in mind when they wrote the script; Sinha turned down the film when he heard Khanna was initially cast in the lead, due to a fallout between the two. Nirupa Roy&#x27;s role as Sumitra Devi was also first offered to Vyjayanthimala; Nischol and Vyjayanthimala turned down the film after they found out Khanna would no longer be involved. Shashi Kapoor was subsequently cast as Ravi, and Nirupa Roy as Sumitra Devi.

In 2014, Bachchan revealed that his iconic look in the film – a &quot;denim blue shirt worn with khakee pants and a rope dangling over the shoulder&quot; – was the result of a mistake by the tailor. He said, &quot;The knotted shirt and rope on the shoulder in [&quot;Deewaar&quot;] was an adjustment for an error in stitching, shirt too long so knotted it&quot;. In certain scenes, Bachchan had some input on Chopra&#x27;s direction, such as the father&#x27;s funeral scene where Bachchan, instead of lighting the pyre with his right hand, suggests to use his left hand to show off the tattoo, &quot;Mera baap chor hai&quot; (&quot;My father is a thief&quot;). The film was shot mostly at night because Bachchan was shooting for Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s &quot;Sholay&quot; at that time.

The film contains a fight scene that involves Bachchan performing martial arts inspired by Hong Kong martial arts cinema, which &quot;Deewaar&quot; was one of the first to do in Indian cinema. Rather than following the Hollywood model, it follows the Hong Kong model, with an emphasis on acrobatics and stunts. The style of fighting seen in &quot;Deewaar&quot; combined kung fu (as it was perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts (particularly Indian wrestling).

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack of the movie was composed by R. D. Burman, and the lyrics were penned by Sahir Ludhianvi. The soundtrack received praise.
== Release and reception ==

=== Release and sales ===
At the Indian box office, the film grossed ($9million). In Mumbai alone, the film grossed . In terms of footfalls, the film sold an estimated tickets at an average 1975 price of per ticket. Adjusted for inflation, this is equivalent to an estimated () at an average 2017 price of per ticket.

Numerous DVD editions, from companies such as Eros Entertainment, Shemaroo Entertainment and Eagle Home Video, entered the market. These were released as non-restored, non-remastered editions, void of supplementary features. Eagle Home Video came out with a restored edition of this movie, preserving the original aspect ratio in a 4:3 pillar box and a DTS Master Audio (HD) in 2.0. The restoration took place in Shemaroo studios.

=== Critical response and international impact ===
Upon release, &quot;Deewaar&quot; was a major commercial success, ranking as the fourth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1975, and received critical acclaim, with critics praising the story, dialogue and screenplay, as well as the performances of the cast, particularly those of Bachchan, Kapoor and Roy. &quot;Indiatimes&quot; ranks &quot;Deewaar&quot; amongst the &quot;Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films&quot;. It is one of the three Hindi films featured in the 2017 edition of the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, the others being &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957) and &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995).

It was perceived by audiences to be anti-establishment, while Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character Vijay was seen as a vigilante angry hero, establishing Bachchan&#x27;s image as the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Indian cinema. With the unprecedented growth of slums across India at the time, Vijay was seen as a new kind of hero, with his suppressed rage giving a voice to the angst of the urban poor. &quot;Deewaar&quot; is also remembered for its iconic dialogues written by Salim–Javed. The most famous example is when Shashi Kapoor delivers the line, &quot;Mere paas maa hai&quot; (&quot;I have mother&quot;), a line that is widely known in India and has become part of Indian popular culture. The film &quot;Loins of Punjab Presents&quot; (2007) mocked how the line is sometimes wrongly attributed to Amitabh Bachchan. It also established Parveen Babi as the &quot;new Bollywood woman&quot;.

The film cemented the success of the writing duo Salim–Javed, who went on to write many more blockbuster films. After the success of this film, the value of film writers skyrocketed thanks to Salim–Javed, and they soon were being paid as highly as some actors at the time. Amitabh Bachchan described Salim–Javed&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Deewaar&quot; as &quot;the perfect script&quot; and &quot;the best screenplay ever&quot; in Indian cinema. &quot;Deewaar&quot;, one of the first Indian films with an action sequence modelled after Hong Kong martial arts cinema, popularised the use of martial arts sequences in Bollywood films from the 1970s to the 1990s. The style of fighting popularised by &quot;Deewaar&quot;, with acrobatics and stunts, and combining Chinese kung fu (as it was perceived by Indians, based on 1970s Hong Kong films) with Indian pehlwani wrestling, became the standard model for Bollywood action scenes up until the 1990s.

The film was later remade in Telugu as &quot;Magaadu&quot; (1976), in Tamil as &quot;Thee&quot; (1981), in Malayalam as &quot;Nathi Muthal Nathi Vare&quot; (1983), in Persian as &quot;Koose-ye Jonoob&quot; (1978), and in Turkish as &quot;Acıların Çocuğu&quot; (1985). Another remake of &quot;Deewaar&quot; was the 1994 Bollywood film &quot;&quot;, starring Sanjay Dutt as the older criminal brother, Atul Agnihotri as the younger police brother, and Tanuja as the mother. Despite the Telugu remake, the film was remade in Telugu again as &quot;Railway Coolie&quot; (2001).

&quot;Deewaar&quot; had an influence on Hong Kong cinema and in turn Hollywood cinema, by playing a key role in the creation of the heroic bloodshed crime genre of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema. Hong Kong&#x27;s Shaw Brothers studio remade &quot;Deewaar&quot; as &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1979), which in turn inspired John Woo&#x27;s internationally acclaimed breakthrough &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986). &quot;The Brothers&quot; also starred a Hong Kong actor that would later be known for heroic bloodshed films, Danny Lee (playing Shashi Kapoor&#x27;s character), with a police officer persona later seen in Hong Kong crime films such as Woo&#x27;s &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989). &quot;Deewaar&quot;, along with several later 1970s &quot;angry young man&quot; epics it inspired, such as &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977), had similarities to elements later seen in 1980s Hong Kong heroic bloodshed films.

British director Danny Boyle described &quot;Deewaar&quot; as being &quot;absolutely key to Indian cinema&quot; and cited the film as an influence on his Academy Award winning film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008). The film&#x27;s co-director Loveleen Tandan noted that &quot;Simon Beaufoy studied Salim–Javed&#x27;s kind of cinema minutely.&quot; Actor Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; &quot;are like &quot;Deewaar&quot;, the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money.&quot; &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot;, which pays homage to Amitabh Bachchan, has a similar narrative structure to &quot;Deewaar&quot;. Composer A. R. Rahman referenced the film in his Oscar acceptance speech.

== Awards and nominations ==
&quot;Deewaar&quot; received the Filmfare Best Movie Award of 1976, and also won six more Filmfare Awards for Best Screenplay, Best Dialogue, Best Director, Best Sound, Best Story, and Best Supporting Actor (Kapoor), and received two other nominations for Best Actor (Bachchan) and Best Supporting Actress (Roy).
