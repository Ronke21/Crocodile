<text>The [[family]] as a model for the organization of the [[State (polity)|state]] is a theory of political philosophy. It explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family. The first known writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was Aristotle, who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the polis.

Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, monarchists have argued that the state mirrors the patriarchal family, with the people obeying the king as children obey their father.

==Ancient Greek thought==
The family-state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for aristocratic rule.

Plutarch records a laconic saying of the Dorians attributed to Lycurgus. Asked why he did not establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: &quot;Begin, friend, and set it up in your family.&quot; The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government (see Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans&quot; — Lycurgus, p. 65).

Aristotle often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: &quot;the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler.&quot;(2)/ &quot;The rule of a household is a monarchy, for every house is under one head&quot; Later in the same text, he says that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (&quot;Politics&quot; Bk I, §v, 1–2; 1259a 35–1259b 1)

However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:
Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and master of a family have a common character. This is a mistake; they think that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, numerical difference.” (&quot;Politics&quot; Bk I, §i)&quot;The rule of a father over his children is royal, for he rules by virtue both of love and of the respect due to age, exercising a kind of royal power&quot;After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose. (&quot;Politics&quot; Bk I, §vi)

Aristotle&#x27;s main notion is that the ancient Greek &quot;polis&quot;, or city-state, is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities. Thus, the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.

Arius Didymus in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: &quot;A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.&quot; From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, &quot;[s]o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia).&quot; Further, he claims: &quot;Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy. The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.&quot; (&quot;Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament&quot;, edd Boring, Berger, &amp; Colpe)

==Confucian thought==

Confucius believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the father of the nation. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover international relations (e.g. the emperor of China is treated as the older brother of the Korean king). Confucian family theory is still espoused in North Korea to justify their method of leadership succession.

The concept of family is important in classical Confucianism. For Confucius, &quot;xiào&quot; or filial piety was a &quot;dé&quot; or virtue. The character representing &quot;xiào&quot;, 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (&quot;lao&quot;, old), and the lower representing children (&quot;zi&quot;, son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of &quot;lĭ&quot; were therefore acting in accordance with &quot;yì&quot; (righteousness, or fulfilling one&#x27;s proper roles or acting in harmony with one&#x27;s station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the &quot;Xiàojīng&quot;, or Classic of Filial Piety. In politics, &quot;xiào&quot; is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with &quot;paternal love&quot;; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king&#x27;s law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.

The American diplomat Edmund Roberts in his description of Canton City, which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this for which he gives no source, but it was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:The sovereign of men, say they, &quot;is heaven&#x27;s son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign&#x27;s children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons.&quot;

==Modern thought==
Louis de Bonald wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, he related them to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the Bible:

[It] calls man the &quot;reason&quot;, the &quot;head&quot;, the power of woman: &quot;Vir caput est mulieris&quot; [man is head of woman] says St Paul. It calls woman the helper or &quot;minister&quot; of man: &quot;Let us make man&quot;, says Genesis, &quot;a helper similar to him.&quot; It calls the child a &quot;subject&quot;, since it tells it, in a thousand places, to obey its parents. (&quot;On Divorce&quot; pp. 44–46)

Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of macrocosm/microcosm). He insists that the &quot;&quot; of the family brings about the of state, with “The Kyklos” not far behind. (&quot;On Divorce&quot;, pp. 88–89, 149.)

Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn draws a connection between the family and monarchy:

Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society. (Compare the teaching of Pope Leo XIII: &#x27;Likewise the powers of fathers of families preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in God, from which &quot;all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name&quot; — Eph 3.15&#x27;) The relationship between the King as &#x27;father of the fatherland&#x27; and the people is one of mutual love. (&quot;Liberty or Equality&quot;, p. 155)

==Politics and the family==
In her book, &quot;Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France&quot;, Elisabeth Fraser analyses Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise philo-Hellenism in France. Delacroix&#x27;s symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser&#x27;s argument:

Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.

More recently, George Lakoff has claimed that the left/right distinction in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for right-wing people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for left-wing people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other&#x27;s views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side&#x27;s deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.

Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Speech&quot; 63 (1977), pp. 43–50.

The idea of the commonwealth as a family is close to cliché; it permeates political discourse at every level:

There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the end functional. There are people in it who aren&#x27;t just like you, but they are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, despite our differences.

<text>Scott R. Kurtz (born March 15, 1971) is an American webcomic artist. Known for creating the daily online comic-strip &quot;PvP&quot;, Kurtz is among the first professional webcomic creators.

==Career==
Kurtz was born to a Catholic household in Watsonville, California. He attended the University of North Texas where he created and published a daily comic strip &quot;Captain Amazing&quot; in the &quot;North Texas Daily,&quot; the student newspaper. It ran for four semesters. His first work on the internet were comics related to the MMORPG game Ultima Online called &quot;Samwise&quot; and later &quot;Tales by Tavernlight.&quot; Scott also produced a comic about his life as a newlywed called &quot;Wedlock&quot; for the early subscription comics site Modern Tales. Kurtz also co-wrote the comic &quot;Truth, Justin and the American way&quot; with Aaron Williams.

He launched &quot;PvP&quot; May 4, 1998, for a gaming website (MPOG.COM). In June 1999, Kurtz retooled the strip and re-launched it. In March 2000, he launched a print version as a bi-monthly for Dork Storm Press. After publishing the print version of &quot;PvP&quot; for eight years through Image Comics, he began self-publishing, citing a natural readership decline of the print version and an increase of the online version. His self-publishing company, Toonhound Studios LLC, is a Texas entity with operations in Seattle.

Kurtz created a spin-off webcomic of &quot;PvP&quot; in 2013, entitled &quot;Table Titans&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;The Trenches&quot; with Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik. &quot;The Trenches&quot; was a comic about working in the video game industry which ran from 2011 to 2016. His webcomics career began to slow down in 2018 when his father suffered disabling strokes and he became a caregiver, although he channelled some of his feelings and experiences into the short webcomic &#x27;Mort&#x27;. &quot;PVP&quot; went on hiatus in February 2022. In March 2024 he published the first volume of a graphic novel series set in the world of &quot;Table Titans&quot; with Penguin Random House.

Kurtz played the character Dwarven Fighter Binwin Bronzebottom in &quot;Acquisitions Incorporated&quot;, a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related podcast and live show. In 2013, Kurtz collaborated with Kris Straub to write and produce an animated series for ShiftyLook based on the video game &quot;Mappy&quot;, titled &quot;Mappy: The Beat&quot;, with Kurtz also voicing several characters.

Kurtz lived in Little Elm, Texas until his move to Seattle in 2010, where he worked from the Penny Arcade offices for over a year. He now works from home.

<text>Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (QEMM) is a memory manager produced by Quarterdeck Office Systems in the late 1980s through the late 1990s. It was the most popular third-party memory manager for the MS-DOS and other DOS operating systems.

==QEMM product ranges==
;QRAM: A memory manager for Intel 80286 or higher CPUs. It supports Chips and Technologies chipsets. 2.02 added SHADOWRAM switch. QEXT correctly reallocates eXtended Memory Specification (XMS). It includes VIDRAM, Optimize, LOADHI from QEMM 6.02, Manifest 1.13. Earlier versions of QRAM also supported the older 8086 and 8088 CPUs.

;QEMM Game Edition: It is a version of QEMM that includes Quarterdeck GameRunner. Patches for regular QEMM do not work on QEMM Game Edition.

;QEMM MegaBundle: In the version shipped with Borland SideKick for Windows, it is a version with SideBar 1.00 (1994-08-22) and QEMM 7.5.

;DESQview 386: It includes DESQview and QEMM-386.

==Features/tools==

===QEMM driver===

QEMM provides access to the Upper Memory Area (UMA) and memory through the Expanded Memory Specification (EMS), Extended Memory Specification (XMS), Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) and DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI).

*Quickboot: It allows a form of warm reboot or local reboot to be performed without going through the BIOS. It will therefore completely bypass the POST, including the BIOS startup screen and the time-consuming memory test and device enumeration, and just restore the CPU state and interrupts to their initial state after POST.

===DOS-Up===
It relocates DOS kernel, COMMAND.COM interpreter, DOS resources (e.g.: buffers, file handles, stacks, lastdrive). It supports DOS 3.2 or higher.

===HOOKRAM===
It allows drivers to be loaded before loading QEMM and still allow the use of QEMM&#x27;s Stealth feature.

===MagnaRAM===
It was a virtual memory compression utility for Windows 3.1, Windows For Workgroups and Windows 95. MagnaRAM is included with QEMM 97.

MagnaRAM was also released as a separate utility.

MagnaRAM worked by replacing a portion of Windows&#x27; virtual memory system. MagnaRAM would insert itself in the string of Windows Programs that determined what pieces of RAM will be moved to the hard disk. Instead of writing directly to the hard disk, the information to be written would go to MagnaRAM&#x27;s own buffer as this was a faster process. During CPU idle, MagnaRAM would compress the information in its own RAM buffer. When the RAM buffer becomes full, it is then swapped to the hard disk taking both less time and less space.

===Manifest===
Manifest (MFT) is a hardware information utility that displays information about user&#x27;s system.

*1.11 fixed minor cosmetic bugs.
*1.12 can identify PS/2 Model 57SX, Compaq Deskpro 486s/16M, Sharp MZ-100. Available EMS in System Overview screen was corrected when using Stealth.
*1.13 fixed Award BIOS identification problem.
*Version 2.0 provides information on network, enhance reporting of video capabilities, APM, DPMI/VCPI/EMS/XMS memory. New feature include editing DOS and Windows boot configuration files.

===Optimize===
Similar to MEMMAKER, it is a utility that calculates, and allows user to choose optimal orders of loading drivers and TSRs. However, OPTIMIZE allows preview of adjustments be made without rebooting. Shipped with QEMM and DESQview.

===QDPMI===
QDPMI is a DPMI 0.9 server driver, authored by Dan Spear. It requires 386 CPU and QEMM386.

===QEMM 50/60===
It is a version of QEMM driver for the IBM PS/2 Models 50 and 60.

Version 4.03 supports IBM Memory Expansion Option boards with 2-8MB memory.

===Stealth===
It can relocate memory assigned for CGA character set away from UMA.

Beginning with QEMM version 8, it allows ROM contents in UMA to be relocated to provide more memory for TSRs. Additional Stealth Windows compatibility is provided with VxDs.

===Stealth DoubleSpace/D*Space===
Stealth D*Space allows DoubleSpace or DriveSpace to be loaded high.

===T386===
It allows Toshiba laptops to work with QEMM&#x27;s EMS manager.

===VIDRAM===
*Provides extra conventional memory in text mode programs, by reclaiming buffers located in UMA that are used in graphics modes.
*It requires EGA/VGA-compatible video card.
*VIDRAM EMS supports DMA-based video memory access at the expense of EMS memory for buffer.

===Limitations===

====Device driver limit====
LOADHI.SYS loads up to 1 device driver at a time in QEMM 4.23, 2 in QEMM 5, 32 in QEMM 6.

====MagnaRAM limit====
Maximum compression threshold setting is 100% for all versions of MagnaRAM 2.00-2.02, except for MagnaRAM 2.00 included with QEMM 8.00, which has the maximum setting of 80%.

====Memory limit====
* QEMM 5.0 can manage up to 16 MB EMS, 16 MB XMS.
* QEMM 6.0 can manage up to 64 MB EMS, 64 MB XMS.
* QEMM 6.02 can manage up to 128 MB EMS, 128 MB XMS. EMBMEM (16-bit) parameter limit was removed.
* QEMM 7.0-7.03 can manage up to 128 MB EMS, 128 MB XMS.
* QEMM 7.04, 7.5, 8.0-8.3 and 97 (aka QEMM 9.0) can manage up to 256 MB EMS/XMS.

By default, QEMM 7.04 and above provide up to a total of 64 MB RAM shared among XMS, EMS and VCPI memory, unless the USERAM= parameter is used. For example, to allow access to up to 256 MB EMS (or 256 MB XMS), specify: QEMM386.SYS USERAM=1M-256M 

For QEMM 7.04 and above, the maximum addressable RAM is 256 MB of memory, shared among XMS, EMS and VCPI memory. Initially, XMS allocates the entire 256 MB and shares it with EMS and VCPI as needed, that is, as EMS and VCPI request memory blocks, XMS free memory is reduced by that same amount.

====Optimize limit====
Versions up to QEMM 6.01 can process batch files up to 9KB, and 20KB in QEMM 6.02.

Batch file line limit is 512 for QEMM versions up to 6.02.

====Stealth DoubleSpace/D*Space====
Stealth D*Space does not support Windows 95 or later versions of DriveSpace.

==Version history==
Originally, the product was called QEMM-386 (requiring an Intel 80386 and DOS 3.30.), and was released with a complementary product called QRAM (for use on intel 80286 and 8088). The &quot;386&quot; suffix was dropped starting with QEMM version 7.0 in 1993, when Intel released the Intel Pentium on March 22, 1993. The final release was re-branded as QEMM 97 to follow Microsoft&#x27;s new branding trend of using year released instead of version numbers, specifically, Windows 95 and Windows 95 OSR2.

===QEMM-386 v4.2 (November 11, 1988)===
* Supported Intel 80386 and DOS 3.30.
* Bundled with QRAM for 80286 or 8088/8086 computers.

===QEMM-386 v5.0 (January 1990)===

*However, run the installer, install.exe, from a pure DOS (DOS 7.10 or DOS 6.22) without Windows present, and it will configure and install only the DOS utilities; updating only DOS&#x27; config.sys and autoexec.bat files.

==QEMM Configurations==
QEMM provides up to 635K free conventional memory (RAM under 640K), far better than pure MS-DOS EMM386, FreeDOS JEMM386, UMBPCI and many other memory manager programs. QEMM maximum RAM is 635K free conventional memory with up to 256MB XMS/256MB EMS shared.

===MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 3.11/WFW 3.11===
MS-DOS 6.22 provides 619K free conventional memory and up to 64MB XMS/32MB EMS shared RAM. Assuming unaltered MS-DOS 6.22, without 3rd party utilities, i.e. JEMM, UMBPCI, etc. QEMM increases the available free conventional RAM to 635K with shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS.

While using Windows 3.11 or Windows For Workgroups 3.11, QEMM provides additional free conventional memory for DOS Prompt running under Windows. QEMM is well suited for Windows 3.x as has supported for it since QEMM v5.x as early as 1990. As a result, QEMM 8.03 or QEMM 97 integrate very well with Windows 3.11/WFW 3.11.

===MS-DOS 7.10, Windows 95 OSR2/Windows 98 SE===
QEMM increases the available free conventional RAM for MS-DOS 7.10 and also for DOS Prompt under Windows 95 OSR2/Windows 98 SE. However, QEMM maximum RAM is a shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS, which is less than what DOS 7.10 and Windows 95/98 support without QEMM. MS-DOS 7.10 provides 624K free conventional memory and up to 1GB XMS/32MB EMS; assuming unaltered MS-DOS, using HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE without any 3rd party utilities. Thus, QEMM is compatible with MS-DOS 7.10 and Windows 9x and provides slightly more free conventional RAM but it does lower the maximum RAM to 256MB XMS/256MB EMS.

=== Consequences of using or disabling EMS ===
EMS memory normally uses a 64KB of UMB as the Page Frame, this reduces the total UMB available to DOS. So some recommend turning off EMS, using the NOEMS switch, to increase the total UMB free by 64KB. QEMM supports NOEMS switch, however, it is far better to provide EMS than saving the 64K Page Frame.

QEMM takes advantage of EMS memory and usually will create more free RAM in the lower 1M address space than the 64KB required for EMS. QEMM StealthROM, SqueezeFrame, and Stealth D*Space all require EMS to work by mapping ROM and data buffers into EMS, thus freeing more UMB&#x27;s.

QEMM&#x27;s TechNote &quot;FRAME.TEC&quot; states: 

===Example: 635K Free, shared 256MB XMS/256MB EMS===

DOS=HIGH,UMB
device=C:\QEMM\dosdata.sys
device=C:\QEMM\qemm386.sys R:1 RAM UR=1M-256M ST:M I=b000-b7ff X=f000-ffff
device=C:\QEMM\dos-up.sys @C:\QEMM\dos-up.dat
shell=C:\QEMM\loadhi.com /R:2 C:\command.com C:\ /P /E:1024

Note: If using VMware, then replace the qemm386.sys line with

device=C:\QEMM\qemm386.sys R:1 RAM UR=1M-256M X=e800-e900
===Skipping QEMM386 while booting===
Hold ALT key during boot and qemm386.sys will not load but prompt to hit Esc to skip loading.

Alternatively, hold F5 so DOS skips loading all of config.sys + autoexec.bat or hold F8 so DOS prompt Y/N to confirm each line in config.sys and autoexec.bat; allowing you to skip loading qemm386.sys, dos-up, dosdata, etc.

May help while testing new configuration that lead to system lockups. Holding ALT or pressing F5/F8 during boot might be the saving touch!

==DOS equivalents==
Microsoft released comparable but simpler memory managers of its own - HIMEM.SYS for XMS and EMM386.EXE for EMS with MS-DOS 4.01 in 1989; earlier Windows/386 2.1 included a built-in EMM which offered EMS to DOS windows during Windows sessions only. These versions could not yet create Upper Memory Blocks. Digital Research&#x27;s DR DOS 5.0 (1990) was the first non-vendor-specific DOS to offer the UMB technology, incorporating a 386-mode XMS/EMS manager also called EMM386. It could also allocate some of the video memory or EMS memory as UMB memory. 

MS-DOS finally offered UMBs in 1991 with version 5.0. MS-DOS&#x27; EMM386 required HIMEM to be loaded first, while DR-DOS&#x27; EMM386 fulfilled both roles and did not need a separate XMS driver, which was still provided but only needed on 80286-based machines (originally named HIDOS.SYS, later HIMEM.SYS). If an XMS driver was loaded before DR-DOS EMM386, it would use this instead of the built-in XMS manager. Using an external and possibly customized XMS driver could help overcome issues with BIOS memory reporting functions causing the memory manager not to see all available memory, and on machines using non-standard gate-A20 switching methods, whereas using the internal XMS driver EMM386 could take advantage of speed-optimized 32-bit code for the XMS driver and relocate all but a tiny stub of the XMS driver into Extended Memory. DR-DOS EMM386 could fill &quot;free&quot; areas with UMBs or map RAM over unused ROM areas in virtual mode, provide support for DPMI (and - in some special issues - DPMS), and load the support for pre-emptive multitasking and multithreading components of the operating system.

==Windows transition / Decline of QEMM==

While popular when DOS programs were the mainstream, QEMM eventually became largely irrelevant as Windows programs and more intensive DOS programs, particularly games, using DOS extenders replaced traditional DOS programs for most users. Also, some of the DOS users switched to protected mode operating systems unsupported by QEMM, such as the Windows NT series and Linux.

The final version was QEMM 97, which was compatible with Windows 95 and later Windows 98/ME, but by this point, not only was DOS memory management no longer in high demand, but the remaining competitive DOS applications (including various GNU utilities and text editors) supported EMS, XMS, or DPMI - which reduced demand for conventional memory - or had been ported to Windows 95 or higher. The availability of increasing RAM sizes at low cost served to reduce the need of MagnaRAM. Finally, modern PCI chipsets provide documented functionality to remove write protection from unused UMA; in many or most cases, this last fact eliminates the need for QEMM for even those relatively few users who use DOS applications and who might otherwise find QEMM essential.

<doc id="719382" wikidata="Q2658760" url="?curid=719382" title="ǂAakhoe dialect">
<text>ǂAakhoe (ǂĀkhoe) and Haiǁom are part of the Khoekhoe dialect continuum and are spoken mainly in Namibia. In the sparsely available material on the subject, ǂAkhoe and Haiǁom have been considered a variant of the Khoekhoe language, as separate dialects (Haacke et al. 1997), as virtual synonyms of a single variant (Heikinnen, n.d.), or as &quot;a way in which some Haiǁom speak their language in the northern part of Namibia&quot; (Widlock, n.d.). ǂAkhoe especially is intermediate between the Khoekhoe and Kalahari branches of the Khoe language family.

==The people==
The Haiǁom are traditionally hunter-gatherers, and many aspects of this traditional culture have been preserved in spite of the political, economic, and linguistic marginalisation of the group. Characteristical features of their culture include healing trance dances, hunting magic, intensive usage of wild plant and insect food, a unique kinship and naming system, frequent storytelling, and the use of a landscape-term system for spatial orientation.

The Haiǁom live in the savannah of northern Namibia, in an area stretching from the edges of Etosha salt pan and the northern white farming areas as far as the Angola border – and perhaps beyond – in the north and Kavango in the east. 
According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot; there were 52,000 Haiǁom speakers in 2016.

==Grammar==
In theory ǂAkhoe possesses free word order, with the subject–object–verb order (SOV) being the dominant preference. In keeping with the typological profile of SOV languages, adjectives, demonstratives and numerals generally precede nouns. Nouns are marked by person–gender–number (PGN) markers. Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals all agree with their head noun.

Mãa is an interrogative used freely in Haiǁom, the subject &quot;|ũ&quot; takes the suffix &quot;-ba&quot;, which is a PGN marker denoting the 3rd person masculine singular. The indirect object &quot;nde&quot;, a demonstrative, follows the noun, and is inflected in concord with the head noun.

Compound structures are highly productive in ǂAkhoe and vary widely in the combination of word categories. The possibilities include: noun+noun, noun+adverb or vice versa, noun+adjective or vice versa, adjective+adjective, adjective+adverb or vice versa, adjective+suffix, or multiple combinations of the above.

==Phonology==
Comparing Heikinnen&#x27;s and Widlock&#x27;s contribution to ǂAkhoe phonology with the more general and theoretical phonological work of Peter Ladefoged (1996), ǂAkhoe can be said to have 47 phonemes. However, an in-depth phonological sketch of the language might show other results where the vowels are concerned.

=== Consonants===
There are 34 consonants in ǂAkhoe, 20 of which are clicks produced with an ingressive airstream, and 14 of which are pulmonic consonants produced with an egressive airstream.

===Vowels===
ǂAkhoe Haiǁom has a total of 12 vowel phonemes. These can be divided into monophthongs and diphthongs, with a further subdivision into oral and nasal pronunciation.

<doc id="719383" wikidata="Q5537216" url="?curid=719383" title="George Brandis">
<text>George Henry Brandis (born 22 June 1957) is an Australian former politician. He was a Senator for Queensland from 2000 to 2018, representing the Liberal Party, and was a cabinet minister in the Abbott and Turnbull governments. He was later High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 2018 to 2022.

Brandis studied law at the University of Queensland and Magdalen College, Oxford. Before entering politics he practised as a barrister. He was appointed to the Senate in 2000 to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Warwick Parer. He served as Minister for the Arts and Sport for the last year of the Howard government in 2007. When the Coalition returned to power in 2013, Brandis became Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts. He relinquished the latter portfolio in 2015, when Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister, but was instead made Leader of the Government in the Senate.

Brandis announced his retirement from politics in December 2017, with effect from February 2018. He replaced Alexander Downer as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in May 2018, departing the role in April 2022. In June 2022, Brandis was appointed a professor in national security at the Australian National University.

==Early life==
Brandis was born in Sydney and was brought up in the inner-west suburb of Petersham. He attended Christian Brothers&#x27; High School, Lewisham before moving to Brisbane and attending Villanova College and the University of Queensland, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with First-Class Honours in 1978 and a Bachelor of Laws with First-Class Honours in 1980.

Following graduation, Brandis served as Associate to Justice Charles Sheahan of the Queensland Supreme Court. He was then elected a Commonwealth Scholar and obtained a Bachelor of Civil Law from Magdalen College, Oxford in 1983.

==Legal career==

After a brief period as a solicitor in Brisbane, Brandis was called to the Queensland Bar in 1985 where he practised until entering politics in 2000. Brandis developed a commercial practice with a particular emphasis on trade practices law. He appeared as junior counsel in the High Court of Australia in the equity case &quot;Warman v Dwyer&quot;. He was also the junior barrister for the plaintiff in the long running &quot;Multigroup Distribution Services v TNT Australia&quot; litigation in the Federal Court of Australia.

Brandis applied to be appointed Senior Counsel in the late 1990s, but was unsuccessful. Brandis applied again in 2006. He was not on the Queensland Bar Association&#x27;s shortlist; however the Chief Justice of Queensland, Paul de Jersey, who had the power to make the ultimate determination, added Brandis&#x27; name to the list, and Brandis was appointed Senior Counsel in November 2006. This was controversial, since Brandis had not practised at the bar since 2000. In June 2013, the original title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel was restored by the Queensland Government and Brandis was one of 70 (out of 74) Queensland SCs who chose to become QCs.

Brandis has co-edited two books on liberalism, and published academic articles on various legal topics, one of which was cited by the High Court of Australia in the landmark defamation case &quot;ABC v O&#x27;Neill&quot;.

While at the Bar, Brandis was a board member of UNICEF Australia for 10 years. He has also been an Associate of the Australian Institute for Ethics and the Professions, and lectured in jurisprudence at the University of Queensland from 1984 to 1991.

==Early political involvement==
According to Peter Baume, during the 1980s Brandis was a key member of the Liberal Forum, a social or classical liberal faction within the party. He &quot;cut his political teeth fighting a rearguard action against the incoming tide of neoliberal economics and a muscular social conservatism that increasingly came to characterise the party in the late 1980s and early 1990s&quot;. He was a co-editor of two anthologies produced by members of the faction, titled &quot;Liberals Face the Future&quot; (1984) and &quot;Australian Liberalism: The Continuing Vision&quot; (1986).

==Parliamentary career==

Brandis was first chosen by the Parliament of Queensland to fill a casual vacancy following the resignation of Senator the Honourable Warwick Parer. He was elected to a further six-year term at the 2004 election.

In his period as a senator, he has served as Chairman of the Economics Committee and as Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Children Overboard Inquiry.

Brandis has also made a number of public speeches. In 2003, he described the Australian Greens as eco-fascist.

Brandis claimed over $1,000 in taxpayer expenses to attend the inaugural Sir Garfield Barwick address in Sydney on 28 June 2010. The event was billed as a Liberal party fund-raiser.

In 2016 Brandis was caught on a &quot;hot mic&quot; calling his state colleagues in the Queensland Liberal National Party &quot;very very mediocre&quot;.

==Ministerial career==
===Howard administration===
On 23 January 2007, Brandis was appointed Minister for the Arts and Sport, replacing Senator Rod Kemp. He lost his ministerial position on the defeat of the Howard government in the 2007 election.

===Shadow ministry===
On 6 December 2007 the new Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party, Brendan Nelson, appointed Brandis Shadow Attorney-General, a position he continued to hold under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull.

On 2 June 2008 Brandis, in his capacity as Shadow Attorney-General, referred the &quot;Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws – Superannuation) Bill 2008&quot; to a Senate committee for review. The aim of the bill was to remove legislative provisions that discriminated against gay and lesbian citizens, in this case relating to superannuation. Brandis stated that the Opposition believed discrimination of this type should be removed and supported the Labor government&#x27;s bill against the more conservative elements of his own party. However, he insisted on a review of the proposed legislation prior to enactment. The bill was passed into law with bipartisan support on 9 December 2008.

Brandis consistently opposed proposals for a bill of rights.

In January 2010, Brandis commented on a controversial debate between Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard and federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott on the topic of advice given to children regarding abstinence.

===Abbott government===

Following the 2010 Australian federal election, at which he was returned, Brandis was appointed Shadow Attorney-General, Shadow Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in the Abbott shadow ministry.

In 2011, Brandis submitted specific accusations to NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione that sitting federal M.P. Craig Thomson committed larceny and fraud through misuse of a credit card in the Health Services Union expenses affair. This led to some questioning Brandis&#x27;s suitability as attorney-general if the opportunity ever arose.

Brandis faced public scrutiny when it was revealed that in 2011 he had billed the taxpayer for attending the wedding ceremony of Sydney radio shock-jock Michael Smith, who had colluded with Brandis to publicise the Craig Thomson media saga.

As Arts Minister, Brandis received significant criticism from the arts industry for a $105 million cut to the Australia Council for the Arts funding in the 2015-16 Australian Federal Budget. The money was reallocated to a new program, The National Program for Excellence in the Arts (NPEA). The NPEA in turn has been criticised by many artists and arts organisations for lacking the &quot;arms-length&quot; funding principles that have applied to the relationship between the government and the Australia Council since its inception in the 1970s. These principles have traditionally had bipartisan support. Brandis had been criticised previously for giving Melbourne classical music record label Melba Recordings a $275,000 grant outside of the usual funding and peer-assessment processes. Brandis&#x27;s changes to funding arrangements, including the quarantining of the amount received by Australia&#x27;s 28 major performing arts companies, are widely seen to disadvantage the small-to-medium arts sector and independent artists. Following Malcolm Turnbull&#x27;s successful spill of the leadership of the Liberal party in September 2015, Brandis was replaced as arts minister by Mitch Fifield.

====Freedom of speech and Section 18C====

The Abbott government took a proposal to amend the Racial Discrimination Act to the 2013 Federal Election. The Government argued that the Act unduly restricted free speech in Australia, by making &quot;insult&quot; and &quot;offence&quot; the test for breach of the law. As Attorney-General, Brandis argued the case for amending the Keating government&#x27;s controversial Section 18C of the Act. In March 2013, Brandis released draft amendments for community consultation, and announced that the proposed changes would &quot;strengthen the Act&#x27;s protections against racism, while at the same time removing provisions which unreasonably limit freedom of speech.&quot; After community consultation, the Government was unable to secure support for changes to the Act from the Senate, and the Abbott government shelved the proposal. The draft amendments had met with criticism from the ALP, Liberal MP Ken Wyatt, and an alliance of racial minority representatives including Jewish lobby groups concerned with holocaust denials in the media.

Brandis did not support the Labor government&#x27;s proposed media reforms in 2013, and was outspoken in support of greater press freedom, particularly for Andrew Bolt who was found to have breached racial vilification laws in commenting on Indigenous Australians of mixed-race descent. 
As Attorney-General in 2014, Brandis furthered his push to amend the RDA, in part to allow media commentators such as Andrew Bolt greater freedom of expression, and to legally ensure that &quot;people do have a right to be bigots&quot;. Brandis labelled Bolt&#x27;s comments on mixed descent Aboriginal people, found by the Federal Court to be racial vilification, as &quot;quite reasonable&quot;, although the federal court found Bolt violated the RDA and the plaintiffs were awarded an apology and legal costs. Professor Marcia Langton was a vocal public critic of Brandis&#x27;s proposed repeal of the part of the RDA on which the Bolt case was based.

In 2017, Brandis condemned Pauline Hanson for wearing a Burqa in the Senate Chamber, explaining her &quot;stunt&quot; ridiculed the Muslim community and mocked its religious garments, and he cautioned her against the offence she might cause to the religious sensibilities of Muslim Australians.

====East Timor spying case====
Brandis supported and approved a December 2013 ASIO raid on Bernard Collaery’s Canberra office (a legal representative for East Timor), where all documents and computers were seized by the government, and which Brandis claimed was for national security interests.
Shortly after the raid, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the Australian government was not permitted to use or view any of the raid evidence. Brandis claimed the ICJ ruling was a good outcome for the government. The Timor Gap case involved allegations of ASIS spying during commercial negotiations with the East Timorese over the $40 billion oil and gas reserves of the contested Greater Sunrise fields within the East Timorese exclusive economic zone.

Additionally Brandis approved the ASIO raid and passport cancellation of a former Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) agent, who was a director of technical operations at ASIS and the whistle-blower on the allegations of commercial spying done by Australia on East Timor, which consequently prevented the unnamed former agent from testifying at the ICJ in the Netherlands.

==== Bookshelves ====
In February 2015, it was reported that more than $15,000 of taxpaper money was spent on a second custom-built bookshelf in Brandis&#x27; Parliamentary office to house Brandis&#x27; collection of books and law reports. There had earlier been a $7,000 taxpayer-funded bookcase purchased in 2010 to store $13,000 worth of tax-payer funded books, but a new bookcase was reportedly required because the 2010 version was too large to move to Senator Brandis&#x27; new office following the change of government.

====Dealings with the Australian Human Rights Commission====
In February 2015, Brandis made headlines when he questioned the independence and impartiality of the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, following the public release of a report by the Commission into children in detention which was critical of the Government. Brandis said he had lost confidence in Triggs and the Commission because in October 2014 she had given &quot;inconsistent and evasive&quot; evidence to Senate estimates when explaining the timing of her decision to hold the investigation into children in detention which resulted in the report. Brandis said that the &quot;political impartiality&quot; of the commission had been &quot;fatally compromised&quot; because the commission had only investigated the issue after the Liberal-National Coalition were elected to power, even though there had been a large number of people in detention under the previous Labor government. This, Brandis claimed, was a &quot;catastrophic error of judgement&quot;.

Triggs defended her decision to commence the investigation in early 2014, saying that although the number of detainees had begun to fall while the Coalition were in Government, the length of time in detention had been rising.

Further controversy arose when Triggs told a Senate Estimates hearing that Brandis&#x27; departmental secretary had on 3 February 2015 asked her to resign, just prior to the public release of the commission&#x27;s report. Triggs said that she was told that she would be offered &quot;other work with the government&quot; if she resigned. Initially the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, denied that any offer of any other role was made to Triggs. However, Bishop conceded that an international role had been discussed with Triggs in early February, during a meeting in her office with the secretary of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department, Chris Moraitis.

Some government sources had suggested that Triggs had wanted to be &quot;looked after&quot; if she quit the commission. However, Triggs said she &quot;categorically denies any suggestion that the issue of a job offer and resignation came at [her] instigation&quot;. Triggs said at the Senate hearing that she considered the offer made to her a &quot;disgraceful proposition&quot;.

These events prompted Mark Dreyfus, Labor&#x27;s Shadow Attorney-General, to refer the matter to the Australian Federal Police. Dreyfus said that an offer by Brandis to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign, with the object of affecting the leadership of the commission to avoid political damage, may constitute corrupt or unlawful conduct. The Australian Senate also took up the matter, passing a motion to censure Brandis on 2 March.

===Turnbull government===
====Legal advice controversy====

In October 2016, allegations were made by Australia&#x27;s Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson SC, suggesting that Brandis attempted to block the Solicitor-General from providing legal advice to members of the Australian Government without first seeking and receiving the permission of the Attorney-General. Further allegations were made by Labor party ministers that Brandis had misled parliament on the issue, including those by the Shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, who challenged the independence of Brandis&#x27;s office.

On 25 November 2016, &quot;The West Australian&quot; newspaper reported that the reason for Brandis issuing the direction was that Gleeson had provided advice on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in a High Court case over the collapse of The Bell Group in 1991. The Western Australian government had passed legislation (&quot;Bell Group Company’s Finalisation of Matters and Distribution of Proceeds Act 2015&quot;), elevating the Insurance Commission of WA in the queue of Bell Group creditors ahead of the ATO. In April 2015, the WA state government received an assurance from then federal Treasurer Joe Hockey that the Commonwealth would not intervene, however the ATO sought advice from Gleeson as its counsel that federal taxation law overrode the state legislation. The paper alleged that Brandis had told Gleeson not to run the argument, however it was still contained in the ATO&#x27;s submission to the High Court, which subsequently unanimously rejected the WA government&#x27;s case and struck down the Bell Act.

==== Appointments ====
Prior to the 2016 federal election, Brandis appointed a Liberal Party donor and Brisbane lawyer, Theo Tavoularis, who had represented Brandis&#x27; son in court, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Later in December 2016, Brandis appointed two former Members of Parliament and members of the Liberal Party, who had been voted out at the 2016 federal election, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a 7-year term. Each role has a salary of over $200,000.

==== Resignation ====
Leading up to the 2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, Brandis was increasingly willing to assert &quot;small-l liberal&quot; positions and publicly criticised the coalition government and members of his own party, particularly the Conservative-wing of the party, including Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Brandis was reported as being concerned about the new formation of the Department of Home Affairs under Dutton. Shortly after Dutton criticised lawyers who represented refugees and asylum seekers as &quot;un-Australian&quot;, Brandis gave a speech which championed lawyers and their role in ensuring the supremacy of the law against the executive government, which was largely seen as an attack on Dutton&#x27;s comments.

Brandis formally resigned from the Senate on 8 February 2018. In his farewell speech to the Senate he was critical of anti-terrorism laws being used by his own party as a &quot;political weapon&quot; and warned against the &quot;powerful elements of right-wing politics&quot; who had abandoned concern for the rights of the individual in favour of a &quot;belligerent, intolerant populism&quot;.

==Post-political career==
Brandis was appointed to fill the post of Australia&#x27;s next High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Due to take up the role in March 2018, an Achilles tendon injury delayed his official term start until 3 May 2018. His term as High Commissioner ended in 2022 and he was subsequently appointed a professor at the Australian National University, to teach at the ANU College of Law with a focus on national security, law and policy. He is an Advisory Board member of the Council on Geostrategy. He is a regular columnist for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, a weak key is a key, which, used with a specific cipher, makes the cipher behave in some undesirable way. Weak keys usually represent a very small fraction of the overall keyspace, which usually means that, a cipher key made by random number generation is very unlikely to give rise to a security problem. Nevertheless, it is considered desirable for a cipher to have no weak keys. A cipher with no weak keys is said to have a &quot;flat&quot;, or &quot;linear&quot;, key space.

== Historical origins ==
Virtually all rotor-based cipher machines (from 1925 onwards) have implementation flaws that lead to a substantial number of weak keys being created. Some rotor machines have more problems with weak keys than others, as modern block and stream ciphers do.

The first stream cipher machines were also rotor machines and had some of the same problems of weak keys as the more traditional rotor machines. The T52 was one such stream cipher machine that had weak key problems.

The British first detected T52 traffic in Summer and Autumn of 1942. One link was between Sicily and Libya, codenamed &quot;Sturgeon&quot;, and another from the Aegean to Sicily, codenamed &quot;Mackerel&quot;. Operators of both links were in the habit of enciphering several messages with the same machine settings, producing large numbers of depths.

There were several (mostly incompatible) versions of the T52: the T52a and T52b (which differed only in their electrical noise suppression), T52c, T52d and T52e. While the T52a/b and T52c were cryptologically weak, the last two were more advanced devices; the movement of the wheels was intermittent, the decision on whether or not to advance them being controlled by logic circuits which took as input data from the wheels themselves.

In addition, a number of conceptual flaws (including very subtle ones) had been eliminated. One such flaw was the ability to reset the keystream to a fixed point, which led to key reuse by undisciplined machine operators.

==Weak keys in DES==
The block cipher DES has a few specific keys termed &quot;weak keys&quot; and &quot;semi-weak keys&quot;. These are keys that cause the encryption mode of DES to act identically to the decryption mode of DES (albeit potentially that of a different key).

In operation, the secret 56-bit key is broken up into 16 subkeys according to the DES key schedule; one subkey is used in each of the sixteen DES rounds. DES &quot;weak keys&quot; produce sixteen identical subkeys. This occurs when the key (expressed in hexadecimal) is:
* Alternating ones + zeros (0x0101010101010101)
* Alternating &#x27;F&#x27; + &#x27;E&#x27; (0xFEFEFEFEFEFEFEFE)
* &#x27;0xE0E0E0E0F1F1F1F1&#x27;
* &#x27;0x1F1F1F1F0E0E0E0E&#x27;

If an implementation does not consider the parity bits, the corresponding keys with the inverted parity bits may also work as weak keys:
* all zeros (0x0000000000000000)
* all &#x27;F&#x27; (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
* &#x27;0xE1E1E1E1F0F0F0F0&#x27;
* &#x27;0x1E1E1E1E0F0F0F0F&#x27;

Using weak keys, the outcome of the Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1) in the DES key schedule leads to round keys being either all zeros, all ones or alternating zero-one patterns.

Since all the subkeys are identical, and DES is a Feistel network, the encryption function is self-inverting; that is, despite encrypting once giving a secure-looking cipher text, encrypting twice produces the original plaintext.

DES also has &quot;semi-weak keys&quot;, which only produce two different subkeys, each used eight times in the algorithm: This means they come in pairs &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2, and they have the property that:

:formula_1

where E&quot;K&quot;(M) is the encryption algorithm encrypting message &quot;M &quot;with key &quot;K&quot;. There are six semi-weak key pairs:
* 0x011F011F010E010E and 0x1F011F010E010E01
* 0x01E001E001F101F1 and 0xE001E001F101F101
* 0x01FE01FE01FE01FE and 0xFE01FE01FE01FE01
* 0x1FE01FE00EF10EF1 and 0xE01FE01FF10EF10E
* 0x1FFE1FFE0EFE0EFE and 0xFE1FFE1FFE0EFE0E
* 0xE0FEE0FEF1FEF1FE and 0xFEE0FEE0FEF1FEF1

There are also 48 possibly weak keys that produce only four distinct subkeys (instead of 16). They can be found in a NIST publication.

These weak and semi-weak keys are not considered &quot;fatal flaws&quot; of DES. There are 256 (7.21 × 1016, about 72 quadrillion) possible keys for DES, of which four are weak and twelve are semi-weak. This is such a tiny fraction of the possible keyspace that users do not need to worry. If they so desire, they can check for weak or semi-weak keys when the keys are generated. They are very few, and easy to recognize. Note, however, that currently DES is no longer recommended for general use since &quot;all&quot; DES keys can be brute-forced it&#x27;s been decades since the Deep Crack machine was cracking them on the order of days, and as computers tend to do, more recent solutions are vastly cheaper on that time scale. Examples of progress are in Deep Crack&#x27;s article.

==List of algorithms with weak keys==

* DES, as detailed above.
* RC4. RC4&#x27;s weak initialization vectors allow an attacker to mount a known-plaintext attack and have been widely used to compromise the security of WEP and ARC4 DMRA DMR.
* IDEA. IDEA&#x27;s weak keys are identifiable in a chosen-plaintext attack. They make the relationship between the XOR sum of plaintext bits and ciphertext bits predictable. There is no list of these keys, but they can be identified by their &quot;structure&quot;.
* Blowfish. Blowfish&#x27;s weak keys produce &quot;bad&quot; S-boxes, since Blowfish&#x27;s S-boxes are key-dependent. There is a chosen plaintext attack against a reduced-round variant of Blowfish that is made easier by the use of weak keys. This is not a concern for full 16-round Blowfish.
* GMAC. Frequently used in the AES-GCM construction. Weak keys can be identified by the group order of the authentication key H (for AES-GCM, H is derived from the encryption key by encrypting the zero block).
* RSA and DSA. August 2012 Nadia Heninger, Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, J. Alex Halderman found that TLS certificates they assessed share keys due to insufficient entropy during key generation, and were able to obtain DSA and RSA private keys of TLS and SSH hosts knowing only the public key.

==No weak keys as a design goal==
The goal of having a &#x27;flat&#x27; keyspace (i.e., all keys equally strong) is always a cipher design goal. As in the case of DES, sometimes a small number of weak keys is acceptable, provided that they are all identified or identifiable. An algorithm that has unknown weak keys does not inspire much trust.

The two main countermeasures against inadvertently using a weak key:
* Checking generated keys against a list of known weak keys, or building rejection of weak keys into the key scheduling.
* When the number of weak keys is known to be very small (in comparison to the size of the keyspace), generating a key uniformly at random ensures that the probability of it being weak is a (known) very small number.

A large number of weak keys is a serious flaw in any cipher design, since there will then be a (perhaps too) large chance that a randomly generated one will be a weak one, compromising the security of messages encrypted under it. It will also take longer to check randomly generated keys for weakness in such cases, which will tempt shortcuts in the interest of &#x27;efficiency&#x27;.

However, weak keys are much more often a problem where the adversary has some control over what keys are used, such as when a block cipher is used in a mode of operation intended to construct a secure cryptographic hash function (e.g. Davies–Meyer).

<text>Sandawe is a language spoken by about 60,000 Sandawe people in the Dodoma Region of Tanzania. Sandawe&#x27;s use of click consonants, a rare feature shared with only two other languages of East Africa – Hadza and Dahalo, had been the basis of its classification as a member of the defunct Khoisan family of Southern Africa since Albert Drexel in the 1920s. Recent investigations however (Güldemann 2010) suggest that Sandawe may be related to the Khoe family regardless of the validity of Khoisan as a whole. A discussion of Sandawe&#x27;s linguistic classification can be found in Sands (1998).

Language use is vigorous among both adults and children, with people in some areas monolingual. Sandawe has two dialects, northwest and southeast. Differences include speaking speed, vowel dropping, some word taboo, and minor lexical and grammatical differences. Some Alagwa have shifted to Sandawe, and are considered a Sandawe clan.

SIL International began work on Sandawe in 1996 and to date (2004), Daniel and Elisabeth Hunziker and Helen Eaton continue to work on the analysis of the language. They have so far produced a phonological description, a dialect survey report and several papers on aspects of grammar. Sandawe is also currently (since 2002) studied by Sander Steeman of Leiden University.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Sandawe has five vowel qualities:

All five vowel qualities may be found as short oral, long oral and long nasal vowels. Thus /a/ can be found as , and respectively. There are therefore fifteen basic vowel phonemes. Short nasal vowels also occur, apparently from the historical elision of a nasal consonant that is still attested in related forms. Long vowels are written double, , and long nasal vowels with a tilde, .

Long vowels are about 50% longer than short vowels. In morpheme-final position, low-tone and are frequently devoiced, though this may not occur after , , or .

===Consonants===

====Non-click consonants====
The glyphs in are the practical orthography developed by Hunziker and Hunziker, along with approximate equivalents in the IPA.


 and are and in the northwestern dialect, but often and or even in the southeast. for occurs but is less common.

====Clicks====
The clicks in Sandawe are not particularly loud, when compared to better known click languages in southern Africa. The lateral click can be confused with the alveolar lateral ejective affricate even by native speakers. With the postalveolar clicks, the tongue often slaps the bottom of the mouth, and this slap may be louder than the actual release of the click. Wright et al. transcribe this slapped click or sublingual percussive with the extended-IPA symbol . The voiced clicks are uncommon, being found in a few words such as &#x27;greater kudu&#x27; and (sp. bird). Labialized clicks are found in word-initial position.

The glottalized click phonation is something like creaky voice, not an ejective. In initial position, the glottis is closed during the entire occlusion of the click, and not opened until after the release burst. In medial position, the glottis is closed after the velar closure and before the forward closure, but opened &quot;before&quot; the click release. Such clicks are not nasalized all the way through; in some tokens they are simply prenasalized glottalized clicks, , bearing in mind that the superscript implies coarticulation (that is, that it is pronounced together with the , not after).

The practical orthography is based on Xhosa and Zulu.

===Tone===
Hunziker et al. (2008) transcribe seven phonetic tones: high , mid , low , high falling , mid falling , low falling , and rising (on long vowels only). In Sandawe orthography, they are written as exactly with their IPA spelling, but the rising tone is marked as .

High and low tones are analyzed as the basic tone configurations. However, the high-falling tone is contrastive, for example in &#x27;water&#x27;, but it also occurs often due to a sequence of tones. The mid tone does not occur initially. Hunziker et al. analyze it as a downstepped high tone: //H-L-H// is realized as [H-H-M]. This rightward shift on the tones is a general process in Sandawe. This analysis requires the assumption of floating low tones carried by consonant clusters, and thought to reflect a historical vowel which has been deleted. The low and mid falling tones are a prosodic effect, found on final syllables, or on penultimate syllables followed by a voiceless vowel; this leftward shift of tone before voiceless vowels (which by their nature cannot carry tone) is another general process of Sandawe. Rising tone is only found on long vowels and can be analyzed as a low-high sequence.

Thus at a phonemic level, , , , and are contrastive.

===Phonotactics===
The majority of Sandawe syllables are CV. Morpheme-initially, consonant clusters are of the form Cw; these are not found in the middle of morphemes. Most consonants are attested in this Cw sequence apart from the labials, the glottals (, ), sonorants (, , , ), and the rather infrequent consonants , , , &amp; the voiced clicks, which may simply be gaps in attestation. The rounded vowels , are not found after Cw sequences. Vowel initial syllables, as in &#x27;buffalo&#x27;, are not found initially, though initial glottal stop is not written ( &#x27;mother&#x27;).

Glottal stops are found as syllable codas, though these may be released in an echo vowel in some circumstances. Hunziker et al. prefer to analyze these are final consonants, because the quality of the echo vowel is predictable, and otherwise this is the only place where the vowels . , would have voiceless allophones.

Hunziker et al. find complementary distribution between homorganic NC clusters, which occur only medially (there are no word-final nasal consonants), and nasal vowels, which they only transcribe word finally. It would therefore seem that NC clusters are the realization of a preceding nasal vowel.

Other final consonants are found as consonant clusters in the middle of a word. Historically, these are presumably due to vowel elision, as evidenced by records from the early 20th century and also by tone patterns. In the northwestern dialect, words are found with final consonants where tonal patterns suggest there was once a voiceless final vowel, and where the southeastern dialect retains a voiceless or .

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===


===Syllable structure===
Sandawe syllables are usually of the form CV; in monosyllabic words, word-final nasals are not uncommon, CV(N). Sometimes other consonants are found in word-final position, but this is most probably the result of deletion of word-final voiceless vowels.

A syllabic nasal is found in Swahili loanwords. The most common word structure is disyllabic with or without long vowels (CV(ː)CV(ː)), according to De Voogt (1992).

===Nouns===
Although nouns can be masculine or feminine, there is usually no particular marker that indicates the gender. Many singular feminine human nouns are marked by the ending , whereas some singular masculine human nouns end in . Additionally, definite human feminine nouns must be marked with the suffix , often repeating marking:

Gender assignment for most non-human animates as well as inanimates is largely unpredictable. However, according to Steeman (2011), all body parts are masculine, bigger plants are masculine while smaller plants are feminine, machinery nouns new to the Sandawe (whose names are typically borrowed from Swahili) are usually feminine, and deverbal nouns representing acts (nominalizations) are masculine. According to Eaton (2010), a masculine noun can be made a diminutive by treating it as a feminine noun.

According to Eaton (2010), definite plural nouns are marked with the suffix , while definite associative plurals are marked with the suffix . According to Steeman (2011), definite human plurals are marked with .

===Adjectives===
The same roots may be used as adjectives or verbs according to Kagaya (1993:ix).

===Syntax===
Basic word order in Sandawe is SOV according to De Voogt (1992). However, word order in the Sandawe sentence is very flexible due to the presence of several &#x27;subject identification strategies&#x27;.

Sample sentence (mid tones are not marked):
An article in Studies in African Linguistics, Volume 10, Number 3, 1979, by Gerard Dalgish, describes these &#x27;subject identification strategies&#x27; in detail. Numerous permutations of sentence constituents are allowed in certain tenses, the pattern being: (a) the first constituent is the subject or (b) any non-subject that is first in the sentence must be marked for the subject. Non-subject constituents include verbs, a progressive marker, objects, indirect objects, adverbs, prepositional phrases, complementizers. Similar results are obtained in WH-Questions.
===Tone===
Elderkin (1989) analyzes Sandawe as having two level tones (High, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising). His thesis considers the behavior of tone at word-, sentence- and discourse-level. De Voogt (1992) and Kagaya (1993) list three level tones (High, Mid, Low) and two contour tones (Falling, Rising).

==Classification==

The most promising candidate as a relative of Sandawe are the Khoe languages of Botswana and Namibia. Most of the putative cognates Greenberg (1976) gives as evidence for Sandawe being a Khoisan language in fact tie Sandawe to Khoe. Gueldemann and Elderkin have strengthened that connection, with several dozen likely cognates, while casting doubts on other Khoisan connections. Although there are not enough similarities to reconstruct a Proto-Khoe–Sandawe language, there are enough to suggest that the connection is real. However, other linguists have criticized the proposal as cherry-picking among a large number of non-matching pronominal forms.

The pronominal system is quite similar: 
These may cast some light on the development of clicks. For example, the Sandawe word for &#x27;horn&#x27;, , may be a cognate with the root found throughout the Khoe family. This and other words suggests that clicks may form from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word is lost: &gt; &gt; ().

Another word common to Sandawe and Khoe, the numeral &#x27;four&#x27;, is also found in the neighboring Cushitic languages Aasax and Kwʼadza, and was perhaps borrowed into them from Sandawe.

Since the Khoe family appears to have migrated to southern Africa from the northeast, it may be that Sandawe is closer to their common homeland than the modern Khoe languages are.

<text>Orla Guerin MBE ( ; born 15 May 1966) is an Irish journalist. She is a Senior International correspondent working for BBC News broadcasting around the world and across the UK.

==Early life and career==
Guerin was born in Dublin and attended a convent school. A journalism graduate from the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), she qualified in 1985 with a Certificate in Journalism from the College of Commerce in Dublin. She also holds a master&#x27;s degree in film studies from University College Dublin (UCD).

Guerin began her career working for newspapers in Dublin such as the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; before joining RTÉ News in 1987 and becoming its youngest foreign correspondent when she was sent to Eastern Europe at the age of 23 in 1990. She remained at RTÉ until 1994, additionally reporting from central Europe, the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Sarajevo. Guerin&#x27;s reports from eastern Europe for RTÉ Radio won her a Jacob&#x27;s Award in 1992.

She left RTÉ to run as an Irish Labour Party candidate in the 1994 European Parliament elections. A political novice, Guerin had been hand-picked by then Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Even though she was not selected at the party convention, Spring insisted that she be added to the ballot. She did not win a seat, polling seventh of 15 candidates with 6% of the vote.

==BBC career==
Guerin joined the BBC in 1995. She was based in Los Angeles from January 1996 and became the corporation&#x27;s Southern Europe correspondent in July 1996 and was based in Rome until June 2000. During this period, Guerin reported from Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia and the Basque Country in northern Spain. In the second half of 2000, Guerin was based in Moscow, and covered the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000.

Regularly reporting from war zones, in 2002 Guerin told &quot;Evening Standard&quot; contributor Quentin Letts about having to wear appropriate clothing:

Guerin was appointed the BBC&#x27;s Jerusalem correspondent in January 2001. At the beginning of April 2002, the BBC made an official complaint to the Israeli government after Israeli soldiers fired in the direction of Guerin and her team, forcing them to find cover, while they were recording a peaceful demonstration in Bethlehem in the West Bank. Almost two years later, the Israeli government wrote to the BBC accusing her of a &quot;deep-seated bias against Israel&quot; in a report on a teenage would-be suicide bomber. The BBC defended Guerin&#x27;s reporting. Caroline Hawley succeeded her as the BBC&#x27;s correspondent in Jerusalem. In December 2005, the BBC told &quot;Broadcast&quot; magazine that Guerin had spent two years longer in the Jerusalem posting than the normal three-year rotation usual for its correspondents. Former Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke wrote: &quot;I have no doubt that the decision by the BBC to pull their Middle East correspondent Orla Guerin out of the region and send her to South Africa was part of the normal rotation of BBC news correspondents around the world. However, it was pretty bad timing to announce it within days of Director General Mark Thompson&#x27;s visit to Israel where he had a meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&quot;. In January 2006 she became the BBC&#x27;s Africa correspondent, based in Johannesburg. After this, Guerin was the BBC&#x27;s correspondent based in Islamabad, Pakistan.

In October 2015, former BBC chairman Michael Grade wrote to James Harding, the Head of BBC News, criticising Guerin&#x27;s Middle East reporting. In the letter, which was published in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, Grade faulted her reporting for assuming &quot;equivalence&quot; between Israel and the Palestinians. According to Grade: &quot;it was improper of the correspondent to claim that &#x27;there&#x27;s no sign of involvement by militant groups&#x27;, before immediately showing footage of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) banners at the home of a 19-year-old terrorist who carried out a deadly knife attack at Lion&#x27;s Gate in Jerusalem on October 3&quot;.

On 23 February 2018, Guerin published an investigative report titled &quot;The shadow over Egypt&quot;, where she reported the alleged forced disappearance of Egyptian nationals, including a young woman called Zubeida who, her mother claimed, had been kidnapped by security forces in April 2017. On 26 February 2018 a live interview was broadcast on Egyptian ON TV network, where Zubeida and her husband were interviewed by Amr Adib, a prominent pro-regime reporter. The interview revealed that Zubeida had been estranged from her mother since April 2017, got married and had had a baby just two weeks prior to the BBC report. However, on 27 February 2018, Zubeida&#x27;s mother stated in a live phone-in interview with the Istanbul-based opposition Mekameleen TV station that she stood by all her previous claims and implied that Zubeida had been under duress to perform the interview. On 28 February 2018, reports emerged that Zubeida&#x27;s mother had been arrested by the Egyptian security forces.

In 2019, Guerin was the BBC correspondent in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis and protests.

In January 2020, Guerin&#x27;s reporting from the Yad Vashem Center in Jerusalem on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz caused controversy, being criticised for appearing to link the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to the Holocaust. Over footage of Israeli troops visiting the center, she said, &quot;The state of Israel is now a regional power. For decades, it has occupied Palestinian territories. But some here will always see their nation through the prism of persecution and survival.&quot; She was accused of antisemitism, and of inserting her personal bias against Israel into the Holocaust Memorial ceremony, without relevance to what the report was about. The Campaign Against Antisemitism made a complaint to the BBC and threatened to make a report to Ofcom.

 she is currently based in Kyiv, where she is reporting on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Honours and awards==
In 2002 Guerin won the Broadcaster of the Year award from the London Press Club. In 2003 she was awarded the News and Factual Award by Women in Film and Television UK.

She was appointed MBE (Honorary) for services to broadcasting in 2005.

===Honorary degrees===
In 2002, she was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Essex. In 2009, she was awarded honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland&#x27;s universities, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast and the University of Ulster. In 2014 she was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Bradford. In November 2019, Guerin was awarded an honorary degree by NUI Galway. In December 2024, Guiren was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in University College Dublin.

==Personal life==
Guerin married Reuters correspondent Michael Georgy in 2003.

<doc id="719398" wikidata="Q33411" url="?curid=719398" title="Hadza language">
<text>Hadza is a language isolate spoken along the shores of Lake Eyasi in Tanzania by around 1,000 Hadza people, who include in their number the last full-time hunter-gatherers in Africa. It is one of only three languages in East Africa with click consonants. Despite the small number of speakers, language use is vigorous, with most children learning it, but UNESCO categorizes the language as vulnerable.

==Name==
The Hadza go by several names in the literature. &quot;Hadza&quot; itself means &quot;human being.&quot; &quot;Hazabee&quot; is the plural, and &quot;Hazaphii&quot; means &quot;they are men.&quot; &quot;Hatza&quot; and &quot;Hatsa&quot; are older German spellings. The language is sometimes distinguished as &quot;Hazane,&quot; &quot;of the Hadza&quot;.

&quot;Tindiga&quot; is from Swahili &quot;watindiga&quot; &quot;people of the marsh grass&quot; (from the large spring in Mangola) and &quot;kitindiga&quot; (their language). &quot;Kindiga&quot; is apparently a form of the same from one of the local Bantu languages, presumably Isanzu. &quot;Kangeju&quot; (pronounced &quot;Kangeyu&quot;) is an obsolete German name of unclear origin. &quot;Wahi&quot; (pronounced &quot;Vahi&quot;) is the German spelling of the Sukuma name for either the Hadza west of the lake, or perhaps a Sukuma clan that traces its ancestry to the Hadza.

==Classification==
Hadza is a language isolate. It was once classified by many linguists as a Khoisan language, along with its neighbour Sandawe, primarily because they both have click consonants. However, Hadza has very few proposed cognates with either Sandawe or the other putative Khoisan languages, and many of the ones that have been proposed appear doubtful. The links with Sandawe, for example, are Cushitic loan words, whereas the links with southern Africa are so few and so short (usually single consonant–vowel syllables) that they are most likely coincidental. A few words link it with Oropom, which may itself be spurious; the numerals &quot;itchâme&quot; &quot;one&quot; and &quot;piye&quot; &quot;two&quot; suggest a connection with Kwʼadza, an extinct language of hunter-gatherers who may have had recently shifted to Cushitic. (Higher numerals were borrowed in both languages.)

Several parallels have been collected with many of the Afroasiatic languages. A lexicostatistical proposal for Hadza as a member of the family, perhaps particularly close to Chadic, was criticized by specialists of Hadza and Cushitic as more likely consisting of several layers of loanwords and some chance resemblances, due to insufficient regularity in sound correspondences and a lack of grammatical evidence for a relationship. George Starostin finds the hypothesis of a relationship of Hadza with Afroasiatic theoretically plausible, but that any demonstration of it by lexical comparison remains &quot;almost by definition impossible&quot;, due to the reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic being still poorly developed.

There are no dialects, though there is some regional vocabulary, especially Bantu loans, which are more numerous in the southern and western areas of high bilingualism.

The language is marked as &quot;threatened&quot; in &quot;Ethnologue&quot;.

==Phonology==
Hadza syllable structure is limited to CV, or CVN if nasal vowels are analyzed as a coda nasal. Vowel-initial syllables do not occur initially, and medially they may be equivalent to /hV/ – at least, no minimal pairs of /h/ vs zero are known.

Hadza is noted for having medial clicks (clicks within morphemes). This distribution is also found in Sandawe and the Nguni Bantu languages, but not in the Khoisan languages of southern Africa. Some of these words are historically derivable from clicks in initial positions (many appear to reflect lexicalized reduplication, for example, and some are due to prefixes), but others are opaque. As in Sandawe, most medial clicks are glottalized, but not all: &quot;puche&quot; &#x27;a spleen&#x27;, &quot;tanche&quot; &#x27;to aim&#x27;, &quot;tacce&quot; &#x27;a belt&#x27;, &quot;minca&quot; &#x27;to lick one&#x27;s lips&#x27;, &quot;laqo&quot; &#x27;to trip someone&#x27;, &quot;keqhe-na&quot; &#x27;slow&#x27;, &quot;penqhenqhe ~ peqeqhe&quot; &#x27;to hurry&#x27;, &quot;haqqa-ko&quot; &#x27;a stone&#x27;, &quot;shenqe&quot; &#x27;to peer over&#x27;, &quot;exekeke&quot; &#x27;to listen&#x27;, &quot;naxhi&quot; &#x27;to be crowded&#x27;, &quot;khaxxe&quot; &#x27;to jump&#x27;, &quot;binxo&quot; &#x27;to carry kills under one&#x27;s belt&#x27;.

===Tone===
Neither lexical tone nor pitch accent has been demonstrated for Hadza. There are no known lexical minimal pairs or grammatical use of stress/tone.

===Vowels===
Hadza has five vowels, . Long vowels may occur when intervocalic is elided. For example, or &#x27;to climb&#x27;, but some words are not attested with , as &#x27;she&#x27; vs &#x27;to be ill&#x27;. All vowels are nasalized before glottalized nasal and voiced nasal clicks, and speakers vary on whether they hear them as nasal vowels or as VN sequences. Invariable nasal vowels, although uncommon, do occur, though not before consonants that have a place of articulation to assimilate to. In such positions, and are allophones, but since VN cannot occur at the end of a word or before a glottal consonant, where only nasal vowels are found, it may be that nasal vowels are allophonic with VN in all positions.

===Consonants===
Consonants in shaded cells appear only in loanwords or are NC sequences, which do not appear to be single segments but are listed here to illustrate the orthography. (Not illustrated are nasal–click sequences in the middle of words: aspirated &quot;nch, nqh, nxh&quot; and tenuis &quot;ngc, ngq, ngx&quot;.)
#The nasalization of the glottalized nasal clicks is apparent on preceding vowels, but not during the hold of the click itself, which is silent due to simultaneous glottal closure. The labial (or ) is found in a single mimetic word where it alternates with .
#The labial ejective is only found in a few words.
#The palatal affricates may be pronounced with an alveolar onset ( &quot;etc.&quot;), but this is not required.
#The velar ejective varies between a plosive , a central affricate , a lateral affricate , and a fricative . The other central ejective affricates can surface as ejective fricatives as well (i.e. ).
#The lateral approximant is found as a flap between vowels and occasionally elsewhere, especially in rapid speech. is most common post-pausa and in repeated syllables (e.g. in &quot;lola&quot;, sp. rabbit). A lateral flap realization can also occur. 
#The voiceless velar fricative is known from only a single word, where it alternates with .
# and zero onset appear to be allophones. may be allophones of , and what are often transcribed in the literature as next to a back vowel or next to a front vowel (e.g. the msg copula transcribed &quot;-a, -ha, -wa, -ya&quot;) are nothing more than transitions between vowels.
#The NC sequences only occur in word-initial position in loanwords. The voiced obstruents and nasal consonants and perhaps (on darker background) also seem to have been borrowed.

===Orthography===
A practical orthography has been devised by Miller and Anyawire. As of 2015, this orthography is not being used by any Hadza speakers and is therefore of limited value for communication in Hadza. It is broadly similar to the orthographies of neighboring languages such as Swahili, Isanzu, Iraqw, and Sandawe. The apostrophe, which is ubiquitous in transcription in the anthropological literature but causes problems with literacy, is not used: Glottal stop is indicated by vowel sequences (that is, is written , as in &#x27;the Hadza&#x27;), which true vowel sequences are separated by &quot;y&quot; or &quot;w&quot; (that is, &#x27;two&#x27; is written ), though in some cases an &quot;h&quot; may be justified, and ejectives and glottalized clicks by gemination (apart from reduced instead of *ddl for ). The ejectives are based on the voiced consonants, , because these are otherwise found mostly in borrowings and thus not common. &quot;Tc&quot; and &quot;tch&quot; are as in Sandawe, &quot;sl&quot; as in Iraqw. (This is ultimately a French convention.) Nasalized vowels / VN rimes are . Long vowels are , or where they are due to an elided . A tonic syllable may be written with an acute accent, , but is generally not marked.

==Grammar==
For more information, see 

Hadza is a head-marking language in both clauses and noun phrases. Word order is flexible; the default constituent order is VSO, though VOS and fronting to SVO are both very common. The order of determiner, noun, and attributive also varies, though with morphological consequences. There is number and gender agreement on both attributives (for head nouns) and verbs (for subjects).

Reduplication of the initial syllable of a word, usually with tonic accent and a long vowel, is used to indicate &#x27;just&#x27; (meaning either &#x27;merely&#x27; or &#x27;solely&#x27;) and is quite common. It occurs on both nouns and verbs, and reduplication can be used to emphasize other things, such as the habitual suffix &quot;-he-&quot; or the pluractional infix &quot;&quot;.

===Nouns and pronouns===
Nouns have grammatical gender (masculine and feminine) and number (singular and plural). They are marked by suffixes as follows:
The feminine plural is used for mixed natural gender, as in &quot;Hazabee&quot; &#x27;the Hadza&#x27;. For many animals, the grammatical singular is transnumeric, as in English: &quot;dongoko&quot; &#x27;zebra&#x27; (either one or a group). The masculine plural may trigger vowel harmony: &quot;dongobee&quot; &#x27;zebras&#x27; (an individuated number), &quot;dungubii&quot; &#x27;zebra bucks&#x27;. A couple of kin terms and the diminutive suffix &quot;-nakwe&quot; take &quot;-te&quot; in the m.sg., which is otherwise unmarked.

Gender is used metaphorically, with ordinarily feminine words made masculine if they are notably thin, and ordinarily masculine words made feminine if they are notably round. Gender also distinguishes such things as vines (m) and their tubers (f), or berry trees (f) and their berries (m). Mass nouns tend to be grammatically plural, such as &quot;atibii&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; (cf. &quot;ati&quot; &#x27;rain&#x27;, &quot;atiko&quot; &#x27;a spring&#x27;).

The names reported for dead animals do not follow this pattern. Calling attention to a dead zebra, for example, uses the form &quot;hantayii&quot; (masculine &quot;hantayee&quot;, plural (rare) &quot;hantayetee&quot; and &quot;hantayitchii&quot;). This is because these forms are not nouns, but imperative verbs; the morphology is clearer in the imperative plural, when addressing more than one person: &quot;hantatate, hantâte, hantayetate, hantayitchate&quot; (substitute &quot;-si&quot; for final &quot;-te&quot; when addressing only men; see below for the verbal object suffixes &quot;-ta-, -a-, -eta-, -itcha-&quot;).

====The copula====
The &quot;-pe&quot; and &quot;-pi&quot; forms of nouns often seen in the anthropological literature (actually &quot;-phee&quot; and &quot;-phii&quot;) are copular: &quot;dongophee&quot; &#x27;they are zebras&#x27;. The copular suffixes distinguish gender in all persons as well as clusivity in the 1st person. They are:
Forms with high vowels (&quot;i, u&quot;) tend to raise preceding mid vowels to high, just as &quot;-bii&quot; does. The 3.sg copula tends to sound like a &quot;-ya(ko)&quot; or &quot;-wa(ko)&quot; after high and often mid vowels: ≈ , and transcriptions with &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are common in the literature. 

====Pronouns====
Personal and demonstrative pronouns are:

There are some additional 3rd-person pronouns, including some compound forms. Adverbs are formed from the 3rd-person forms by adding locative &quot;-na&quot;: &quot;hamana&quot; &#x27;here&#x27;, &quot;beena&quot; &#x27;there&#x27;, &quot;naná&quot; &#x27;over there&#x27;, &quot;himiggêna&quot; &#x27;in/behind there&#x27;.

===Verbs and adjectives===
An infix , where V is an echo vowel, occurs after the first syllable of verbs to indicate pluractionality.

The copula was covered above. Hadza has several auxiliary verbs: sequential &quot;ka-&quot; and &quot;iya-&quot; ~ &quot;ya-&quot; &#x27;and then&#x27;, negative &quot;akhwa-&quot; &#x27;not&#x27;, and subjunctive &quot;i-&quot;. Their inflections may be irregular or have different inflectional endings from those of lexical verbs, which are as follows:

The functions of the anterior and posterior differ between auxiliaries; with lexical verbs, they are non-past and past. The potential and veridical conditionals reflect the degree of certainty that something would have occurred. 1sg.npst &quot;-ˆta&quot; and a couple other forms lengthen the preceding vowel. The 1.ex forms apart from &quot;-ya&quot; begin with a glottal stop. The imp.sg is a glottal stop followed by an echo vowel.

Habitual forms take &quot;-he&quot;, which tends to reduce to a long vowel, before these endings. In some verbs, the habitual has become lexicalized (marking the forms with glottal stop), and so an actual habitual takes a second &quot;-he&quot;. Various compound tense-aspect-moods occur by doubling up the inflectional endings. There are several additional inflections which have not been worked out.

The inflectional endings are clitics and may occur on an adverb before the verb, leaving a bare verb stem (verb root plus object suffixes).

====Attributives====
As is common in the area, there are only a few bare-root adjectives in Hadza, such as &quot;pakapaa&quot; &#x27;big&#x27;. Most attributive forms take a suffix with cross-gender number marking: &quot;-e&quot; (m.sg. and f.pl.) or &quot;-i&quot; (f.sg. and m.pl.). These agree with the noun they modify. The &quot;-i&quot; form tends to trigger vowel harmony, so that, for example, the adjective &quot;one-&quot; &#x27;sweet&#x27; has the following forms:
The &quot;-ko/-bee/-bii&quot; ending may be replaced by the copula, but the &quot;e/i&quot; cross-number gender marking remains.

Demonstratives, adjectives, and other attributives may occur before or after a noun, but nouns only take their gender number endings when they occur first in the noun phrase: &quot;Ondoshibii unîbii&quot; &#x27;sweet cordia berries&#x27;, &quot;manako unîko&quot; &#x27;tasty meat&#x27;, but &quot;unîbii ondoshi&quot; and &quot;unîko mana&quot;. Similarly, &quot;dongoko bôko&quot; but &quot;bôko dongo&quot; &#x27;those zebra&#x27;.

Verbs may also be made attributive: &quot;dluzîko akwiti&quot; &#x27;the woman (&quot;akwitiko&quot;) who is speaking&#x27;, from &quot;dlozo&quot; &#x27;to say&#x27;. This attributive form is used with the copula to form the progressive aspect: &quot;dlozênee&quot; &#x27;I am speaking&#x27; (male speaker), &quot;dluzîneko&quot; &#x27;I am speaking&#x27; (female speaker).

====Object marking====
Verbs may take up to two object suffixes, for a direct object (DO) and indirect object (IO). These only differ in the and . The suffixes are also used on nouns to indicate possession (&quot;mako-kwa&quot; &#x27;my pot&#x27;, &quot;mako-a-kwa&quot; &#x27;it is my pot&#x27;).
Two object suffixes are only allowed if the first (the ) is 3rd person. In such cases the reduces to the form of the attributive suffix: &quot;-e&quot; (. / .) or &quot;-i&quot; (. / .); only context tells which combination of number and gender is intended. 3rd-singular direct objects also reduce to this form in the imperative singular; 3rd-plural change their vowels but do not conflate with the singular: see &#x27;dead zebra&#x27; under nouns above for an example of the forms.

===Word order===
The factors governing the word order within noun phrases are not known. Constituent order tends to be SXVO (where X is an auxiliary) for a new or emphasized subject, with the subject moving further back (XSVO, XVSO, and XVOS), or simply not mentioned (XVO) the better it is established. Where context, semantics, and the verbal suffixes fail to disambiguate, &quot;verb–noun–noun&quot; is understood to be VSO.

==Lexicon==
===Numerals===
The Hadza did not count before the introduction of the Swahili language. Native numerals are &quot;itchâme&quot; &#x27;one&#x27; and &quot;piye&quot; &#x27;two&#x27;. &quot;Sámaka&quot; &#x27;three&#x27; is a Datooga loan, and &quot;bone&quot; &#x27;four&#x27;, &quot;bothano&quot; &#x27;five&#x27;, and &quot;ikhumi&quot; &#x27;ten&#x27; are Sukuma. &quot;Aso&quot; &#x27;many&#x27; is commonly used instead of &quot;bothano&quot; for &#x27;five&#x27;. There is no systematic way to express other numbers without using Swahili.

Dorothea Bleek suggested &quot;piye&quot; &#x27;two&#x27; might have a Bantu source; the closest locally in Nyaturu &quot;-βĩĩ&quot;. (Other local Bantu languages have an l/r between the vowels.) Sands first recognized the similarity of &#x27;one&#x27; and &#x27;two&#x27; to Kwʼadza noted above. Militarev notes similar forms to &quot;piye&quot; in Chadic languages, such as Hausa &quot;bíyúú&quot; &#x27;two&#x27;.

===Dead animal names===
Hadza has received some attention for a dozen &#x27;celebratory&#x27; or &#x27;triumphal&#x27; names for dead animals. These are used to announce a kill or find. They are (in the imperative singular):
The words are somewhat generic: may be used for any spotted cat, for any running ground bird. &#x27;Lion&#x27; and &#x27;eland&#x27; use the same root. Blench thinks this may have something to do with the eland being considered magical in the region. 

An IO suffix may be used to reference the person who made the kill. Compare &quot;hanta-&quot; &#x27;zebra&#x27; with the more mundane verbs, &quot;qhasha&quot; &#x27;to carry&#x27; and &quot;kw-&quot; &#x27;to give&#x27;, in the imperative singular (when addressing one person) and the feminine imperative plural (when addressing the camp):


==Speculations about early human language==
In 2003 the press widely reported suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University that the original human language may have had clicks. The purported evidence for this is genetic: speakers of Juǀʼhoan and Hadza have the most divergent known mitochondrial DNA of any human populations, suggesting that they were the first, or at least among the first, surviving peoples to have split off the family tree. In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else. Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, perhaps their common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.

However, besides the genetic interpretation, this conclusion rests on several unsupported assumptions: 
* Both groups have kept their languages, without language shift, since they branched off from the rest of humanity;
* Neither group borrowed clicks as part of a sprachbund, as the Bantu Nguni languages (Zulu, Xhosa etc.) and Yeyi did; and
* Neither the ancestors of the Juǀʼhoan nor those of the Hadza developed clicks independently, as the creators of Damin did.

There is no evidence that any of these assumptions are correct, or even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article is the latest in a long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.

==In popular culture==
* In Peter Watts&#x27;s science-fiction novel &quot;Blindsight&quot;, Hadza is presented as the human language most closely related to the ancestral language of vampires, citing the debunked hypothesis that clicks are good for hunting.

<text>This is a timeline of [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] history comprising important legal and territorial changes and political events in Iceland and its predecessor states. To read about the background to these events, see history of the Faroe Islands.


==7th century==
*About 625 – It was thought Irish monks settled in the Faroe Islands and were the first people there. In earlier historical studies, it was assumed, that they came around 725. After botanical researches it had to be dated back to 675, and today Faroese scientists believe, that oats have been cultivated on the Faroes since about 625, for example in Mykines.

==8th century==
*About 795 – Irish monks reach Iceland. It is suggested, that they came from the Faroes after banished by the Vikings. Diucil refers to it 825, but maybe some of the monks stayed in the Faroes.

==9th century==
*About 825 – Grímur Kamban is said to be the first Norse settler in the Faroes at the place, which is named Funningur (the &quot;find&quot;).
*About 885–890 – Second wave of immigration to the Faroes under king Harald Hårfagre of Norway. Most of the settlers come from western Norway, but also many from Ireland and Scotland.

==10th century==
*Around 900 – The Faroese Althing is assumed to be founded. If this is true, it is the oldest existing parliament of the world.
*Around 970 – The Færeyinga saga starts with its main story. The murder of Brestir and Beinir Sigmundsson is assumed to have happened in 969.
*983 – Return of Sigmundur Brestisson.
*999 – The Faroese Althing adopts Christianity against Trónd&#x27;s resistance.

==11th century==
*1005 – Sigmundur Brestisson is killed by Tórgrímur Illi in Sandvík.
*1026 – King Olaf II of Norway tries to encash taxes from the Faroes and to establish Norwegian law – but fails.
*1028 – The murder of the Norwegian legate Karl of Møre ends Olav&#x27;s attempts.
*1035 – Death of Tróndur í Gøtu, the last Viking chieftain of the Faroes. Leivur Øssursson becomes Christian autocrat over the Faroes as feud under Norwegian government. The Viking age on the Faroes is over.

==12th century==
*Around 1100 – The Faroes become the Diocese of the Faroe Islands, initially suffragan to the archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. The Faroese bishop has his seat in Kirkjubøur until 1538.
*Around 1104 – The diocese comes under the archbishopric of Lund, (today Sweden).
*1152/53 – The diocese becomes part of the archbishopric in Nidaros, Norway.

The boycott started on 28 August 2013, the boycott implies that Faroese vessels carrying herring or mackerel are banned from all EU ports, including Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The Faroe Islands can no longer export herring or mackerel to EU countries as long the boycott persists.

<doc id="719412" wikidata="Q300115" url="?curid=719412" title="AUTOEXEC.BAT">
<text>codice_1 is a system file that was originally on DOS-type operating systems. It is a plain-text batch file in the root directory of the boot device. The name of the file is an abbreviation of &quot;automatic execution&quot;, which describes its function in automatically executing commands on system startup; the filename was coined in response to the 8.3 filename limitations of the FAT file system family.

==Usage==
codice_1 is read upon startup by all versions of DOS, including MS-DOS version 7.x as used in Windows 95 and Windows 98. Windows ME only parses environment variables as part of its attempts to reduce legacy dependencies, but this can be worked around.

The filename was also used by (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron.

In Korean versions of MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.01 and higher (except for PC DOS 7 and 2000), if the current country code is set to 82 (for Korea) and no codice_3 is given and no default codice_1 is found, codice_5 will look for a file named codice_6 instead in order to ensure that the DBCS frontend drivers will be loaded even without properly set up codice_7 and codice_1 files.

Under DOS, the file is executed by the primary copy of the command-line processor (typically codice_9) once the operating system has booted and the codice_10 file processing has finished. While DOS by itself provides no means to pass batch file parameters to codice_9 for codice_1 processing, the alternative command-line processor 4DOS supports a codice_13 &quot;codice_14&quot; directive and codice_15 startup option to define such parameters. Under Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS and REAL/32, three initial parameters will be passed to either the corresponding codice_16 (if it exists) or the generic codice_1 startup file, codice_18 holds the virtual console number, codice_19 the 2-digit terminal number (xx) (with 00 being the main console) and codice_20 the 1-digit session number (y).

Windows NT and its descendants Windows XP and Windows Vista parse codice_1 when a user logs on. As with Windows ME, anything other than setting environment variables is ignored. Unlike codice_7, the commands in codice_1 can be entered at the interactive command line interpreter. They are just standard commands that the computer operator wants to be executed automatically whenever the computer is started, and can include other batch files.

codice_1 is most often used to set environment variables such as keyboard, soundcard, printer, and temporary file locations. It is also used to initiate low level system utilities, such as the following:

* Virus scanners
* Disk caching software
* Mouse drivers
* Keyboard drivers
* CD drivers
* Miscellaneous other drivers

==Example==
In early versions of DOS, codice_1 was by default very simple. The codice_26 and codice_27 commands were necessary as early PC and XT class machines did not have a battery backed-up real-time clock as default.
@ECHO OFF
CLS
DATE
TIME
VER
In non-US environments, the keyboard driver (like codice_28 for the French keyboard) was also included. Later versions were often much expanded with numerous third-party device drivers. The following is a basic DOS 5 type codice_1 configuration, consisting only of essential commands:
@ECHO OFF
PROMPT $P$G
PATH C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS
SET TEMP=C:\TEMP
SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T2
LH SMARTDRV.EXE
LH DOSKEY
LH MOUSE.COM /Y
This configuration sets common environment variables, loads a disk cache, places common directories into the default PATH, and initializes the DOS mouse / keyboard drivers. The codice_30 command sets the prompt to &quot;C:\&gt;&quot; (when the working directory is the root of the C drive) instead of simply &quot;C&gt;&quot; (the default prompt, indicating only the working drive and not the directory therein).

In general, device drivers were loaded in codice_7, and programs were loaded in the codice_1 file. Some devices, such as mice, could be loaded either as a device driver in codice_7, or as a TSR in codice_1, depending upon the manufacturer.

In MS-DOS 6.0 and higher, a DOS boot menu is configurable. This can be of great help to users who wish to have optimized boot configurations for various programs, such as DOS games and Windows.

The codice_35 line informs DOS to look up menu entries that were defined within codice_7. Then, these profiles are named here and configured with the desired specific drivers and utilities. At the desired end of each specific configuration, a codice_37 command redirects DOS to the codice_38 section. Lines after codice_38 will be used by all profiles.

==Dual-booting DOS and Windows 9x==
When installing Windows 95 over a preexisting DOS/Windows install, codice_7 and codice_1 are renamed to codice_42 and codice_43. This is intended to ease dual booting between Windows 9x and DOS. When booting into DOS, they are temporarily renamed codice_7 and codice_1. Backups of the Windows 9x versions are made as codice_46 files.

Windows 9x also installs codice_47, a configuration file, which will not boot Windows 95/98 if parametercodice_48 is loaded, and instead a DOS prompt will appear on the screen (Windows can still be loaded by calling the codice_49 command (file WIN.COM). This file contains some switches that designate how the system will boot, one of which controls whether or not the system automatically goes into Windows. This &quot;BootGUI&quot; option must be set to &quot;0&quot; in order to boot to a DOS prompt. By doing this, the system&#x27;s operation essentially becomes that of a DOS/Windows pairing like with earlier Windows versions. Windows can be started as desired by typing codice_49 at the DOS prompt.

When installing Caldera DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, the Windows version retains the name codice_1, while the file used by the DR-DOS codice_9 is named codice_53, referred to by the startup parameter codice_54 in the SHELL directive. It also differentiates the codice_10 file by using the name codice_56.

== OS/2 ==
The equivalent to codice_1 under OS/2 is the OS/2 codice_58 file. Genuine DOS sessions booted under OS/2 continue to use codice_1.

== Windows NT==
On Windows NT and its derivatives, Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the equivalent file is called codice_60 and is located in the codice_61 directory. The file is not used during the operating system boot process; it is executed when the MS-DOS environment is started, which occurs when a DOS application is loaded.

The codice_1 file may often be found on Windows NT in the root directory of the boot drive. Windows only considers the codice_63 and codice_64 statements which it contains, in order to define environment variables global to all users. Setting environment variables through this file may be interesting if for example MS-DOS is also booted from this drive (this requires that the drive be FAT-formatted) or to keep the variables across a reinstall. This is an exotic usage today so the file usually remains empty. The Tweak UI applet from the Microsoft PowerToys collection allows to control this feature (&quot;Parse AUTOEXEC.BAT at logon&quot;).

<doc id="719413" wikidata="Q3722547" url="?curid=719413" title="1989 Chilean general election">
<text>General elections were held in Chile on 14 December 1989, bringing an end to the military regime that had been in place since 1973. Patricio Aylwin of Concertación alliance was elected President, whilst the alliance also won a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and in the elected Senate seats.

From the 1989 elections onwards the military had officially left the political future of the country to civilians to be elected. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former dictatorship minister Hernán Büchi ran for president as candidate of the two right-wing parties, RN and UDI. He had little political experience and was a relatively young (40 years) technocrat credited for Chile&#x27;s good economic performance in the later half of the 1980s. The right parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, Büchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this right-wing populist Francisco Javier Errázuriz Talavera ran independently for president and made several election promises Büchi could not match.

The centre-left coalition Concertación was rather united and confident. Its candidate Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with Büchi. Büchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the Communist Party of Chile, a party that was not part of Concertación. Aylwin spoke with strength about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it, in contrast Büchi as a regime collaborator lacked any credibility when dealing with human rights violations.

Büchi and Errázuriz lost to Patricio Aylwin. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI to obtain places in parliament and secure its political future. Pinochet declared himself to be satisfied with the election. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.

<text>Thomas Roy Skerritt (born August 25, 1933) is an American actor and director, who has appeared in over 170 film and television productions since 1962. The beginning of his film career coincided with the New Hollywood movement, with a breakthrough role as Duke Forrest in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He then starred in notable films like &quot;The Turning Point&quot;, &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;, &quot;Ice Castles&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, and &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;.

On television, Skerritt played the leading role of Sheriff Jimmy Brock on the family drama &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1992-96), earning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, as well as two Golden Globe Award nominations. He also had a recurring role as Evan Drake on the sixth season of sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (1987-88).

Skerritt is also a three-time Screen Actors Guild Award nominee, a Genie Award nominee, an American Television Award nominee, and is both a Saturn Award and Western Heritage Award winner. In 2022, he received the International Press Academy&#x27;s honorary Mary Pickford Award for &quot;Outstanding Artistic Contribution to the Entertainment Industry.&quot;

==Early life==
Skerritt was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Helen, a homemaker, and Roy Skerritt, a businessman. He is the youngest of three children. A 1951 graduate of Detroit&#x27;s Mackenzie High School, Skerritt attended Wayne State University and the University of California, Los Angeles.

Skerritt enlisted just after graduating from high school, and served a four-year tour of duty in the United States Air Force as a classifications specialist. Most of his enlistment was spent at Bergstrom Field, Austin, Texas.

==Career==
Skerritt made his film debut in &quot;War Hunt&quot;, produced by Terry Sanders and released in 1962. Skerritt&#x27;s notable film appearances include &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (credited as &quot;M. Borman&quot;, 1971), &quot;Fuzz&quot;, &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot;, Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; (1978), &quot;Ice Castles&quot; (1978), as Captain Dallas in &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), as a would-be astronaut in &quot;Contact&quot; (1997) and &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986), and in &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986) as Commander Mike &quot;Viper&quot; Metcalf. In 1988, he starred with Nancy Allen and Lara Flynn Boyle in &quot;Poltergeist III&quot;. In 1989, he played the role of Thomas Drummond &quot;Drum&quot; Eatenton in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. In 1992, he appeared in the critically-acclaimed Robert Redford-directed film &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, playing a fly fishing-loving minister and father of the two protagonist brothers in the film.

Skerritt played a guest part in Ray Walston&#x27;s show &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; in the 1963 episode &quot;Mrs. Jekyll and Hyde&quot; (Walston was a regular cast member thirty years later in Skerritt&#x27;s show &quot;Picket Fences&quot;). He also guest-starred in the television series &quot;The Real McCoys&quot; (1963), as a letter carrier in the episode &quot;Aunt Win Steps In&quot;. He was cast in &quot;Bonanza&quot; in 1964 and in &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; in 1965, as a young gambler, Patrick Hogan, who meets a tragic fate after winning a small fortune in a saloon. In another &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; episode, &quot;A Sense of Justice&quot; (1966), he played a young Roy Bean with his elder brother, Joshua Bean, played by Tris Coffin. In a later &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; role, Skerritt played Mark Twain in the 1968 episode &quot;Ten Day Millionaires&quot;, with Dabney Coleman as Twain&#x27;s mining partner, Calvin H. Higby. The two lose a fortune in gold, but Twain learns his future is in writing. In 1972, Skerritt guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Cannon&quot;, titled &quot;Nobody Beats the House&quot;, playing the role of a young gambler. In 1975, he guest-starred in another episode of &quot;Cannon&quot; titled &quot;The Conspirators&quot;, playing the role of a corrupt sheriff.

His agent, Meyer Mishkin, recounted in a 1978 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; profile that Skerritt was relegated to a series of obscure European westerns after his early 1970s film success. Mishkin took credit for obtaining for Skerritt his co-starring role in &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), effectively salvaging his career, and earning him a Best Supporting Actor National Board of Review Award in the process.

Skerritt appeared in the ABC series &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1964–1967, five episodes); &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1965–1972, also five episodes), and as Evan Drake on &quot;Cheers&quot;. He then appeared in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1992–1996), in the role of Sheriff Jimmy Brock, for which he won an Emmy Award. More recently, he has starred in &quot;Homeland Security&quot; and &quot;The Grid&quot;.

He portrayed the deceased William Walker in &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, having appeared in the pilot and several flashbacks scenes. This was his second time playing the husband of a character played by Sally Field; the first was in &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;.

He played the role of Ezekiel in ABC Family&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Fallen&quot; alongside Paul Wesley. He also appeared as the guide on the showcase website for Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Vista operating system. He lent his voice in the video game &quot;Gun&quot; (2005), in which he voices Clay Allison. He then guest-starred in seasons three and four of &quot;Leverage&quot; as Nate Ford&#x27;s father.

In February 2012, Skerritt played the title role in Pacific Northwest Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. In 2014, Skerritt was reunited with his ex-&quot;Picket Fences&quot; co-star, Lauren Holly, to star with her in &quot;Field of Lost Shoes&quot;. He was reunited with his &quot;Alien&quot; co-star Harry Dean Stanton in &quot;Lucky&quot;, the latter&#x27;s last film (2017).

In 1974, Skerrit portrayed Senator Robert Palmer in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Platform&quot;, episode 7 of &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Skerritt is founder and chairman of Heyou Media, a Seattle-based digital media company.

From 1957 to 1972, Skerritt was married to Charlotte Shanks, with whom he has three children. He was married to Sue Oran, with whom he has a son, from 1977 to 1992. Since 1996, he has been married to Julie Tokashiki. They have one daughter.

<text>Benjamin Cromwell Franklin (April 25, 1805 – December 25, 1873) was the first judicial officeholder in the Republic of Texas.

Franklin was born in Georgia, and educated at Franklin College at the University of Georgia in Athens, before being admitted to the bar in 1827. In 1835, he travelled to Texas, and supported a declaration of war against Mexico. On April 7, 1836, he was appointed a captain in the Texas army.

In March 1836, the Republic of Texas captured a U.S.-owned brig, &quot;Pocket&quot;. Upon realising that this action could alienate the United States, the Texan government took steps to investigate the matter, and President David G. Burnet appointed Franklin district judge of Brazoria to investigate the matter. Franklin resigned his judgeship in 1839, moving to Galveston to practice law.

Franklin was elected to represent Galveston in the House of Representatives in the Third, Fifth, and Eighth Texas Legislatures. Franklin was also elected to serve in the Senate of the Fourteenth Texas Legislature, but died 25 December 1873, 2½ weeks before the start of the regular session

Although it is not officially recorded, Franklin County is generally believed to have been named in his honor.

<doc id="719422" wikidata="Q918197" url="?curid=719422" title="4659 Roddenberry">
<text>4659 Roddenberry, provisional designation , is a Nysian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 2 March 1981, by American astronomer Schelte Bus at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. The likely S-type asteroid has an unsecured rotation period of 12 hours. It was named for American screenwriter Gene Roddenberry.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Roddenberry&quot; is a core member of the Nysa family (), a very large family of stony asteroids, alternatively known as Herta family. It is part of the Nysa–Polana complex, the largest grouping of asteroids in the main-belt. The complex is typically further divided into subfamilies with different spectral properties.

The asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,334 days; semi-major axis of 2.37 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1977, or four years prior to its official discovery observation at Siding Spring.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Roddenberry&quot; is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, typical for core members of the Nysa family and in agreement with its high albedo &quot;(see below)&quot;.

=== Rotation period ===

In the 1990s, a fragmentary rotational lightcurve of &quot;Roddenberry&quot; was obtained from photometric observations by Richard Binzel. Lightcurve analysis gave a highly uncertain rotation period of 12 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.14 magnitude (). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Roddenberry&quot; measures 3.622 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.193, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and derives a diameter of 3.56 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.61.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in memory of famous American screenwriter, producer and futurist, Gene Roddenberry (1921–1991), known for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; television series, and for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film franchise. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 1992 ().

<doc id="719429" wikidata="Q451861" url="?curid=719429" title="Kelly Monaco">
<text>Kelly Marie Monaco (born May 23, 1976) is an American actress, model, and reality television personality, best known for her portrayal of Sam McCall on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and as the first season winner of the reality TV competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Monaco was also Playboy &quot;Playmate of the Month&quot; for April 1997, and portrayed Livvie Locke on the soap opera &quot;Port Charles&quot; from 2000 through 2003.

==Early life and education==
Kelly Monaco was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Albert &quot;Al&quot; and Carmina Monaco. She is the middle child and has four sisters. The family moved to the Poconos, where she attended Pocono Mountain High School and took her first acting classes. After high school, she worked as a lifeguard at a local resort and attended Northampton Community College for two years.

==Career==
===Early modeling===
In 1996, Monaco, who had been thinking of a career in modeling, sent her photo to &quot;Playboy&quot;. As a result, she became the Playmate of the Month for April 1997. Throughout her tenure with &quot;Playboy&quot; in the 1990s, Monaco was also featured in many Playboy Special Edition publications.

===Acting and reality television===
Monaco&#x27;s first television role was in the drama &quot;Baywatch&quot; from 1997 to 1998. In addition to playing the role of Susan on the show, she was also Carmen Electra&#x27;s body double at times, as Electra could not swim. Monaco also had minor roles in the late 1990s films &quot;BASEketball&quot;, &quot;Idle Hands&quot;, and &quot;Mumford&quot;.

Monaco played Olivia &quot;Livvie&quot; Locke Morley (1999–2003) in the ABC soap opera &quot;Port Charles&quot;, as well as Livvie&#x27;s magically created doppelganger Tess Ramsey (2002–03). When that program ended, she joined the cast of the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, of which &quot;Port Charles&quot; had been a spinoff, as Samantha McCall in October 2003.

In 2003, Monaco was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role on &quot;Port Charles&quot;. In 2006, she was again nominated for a Daytime Emmy, this time for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Sam McCall on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 2006, Monaco also co-hosted the 33rd Annual Daytime Emmys, with &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; host Tom Bergeron.

In March 2009, Monaco was chosen by Donald Trump and Paula Shugart to be one of the judges for the 2009 Miss USA pageant.

Monaco starred on the E! reality television series &quot;Dirty Soap&quot;, which premiered on September 25, 2011.

She was a cast member, and the season winner along with her professional partner, Alec Mazo, on the ABC reality-television series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, during its first season in 2005. Although she initially faced tough criticism from the judges, she maintained a positive outlook throughout the series. Among the events she experienced before her victory was a wardrobe malfunction in which the skimpy strap on her dress came apart during a Latin dance number. Monaco remained the only female to win the competition until season 6 when Kristi Yamaguchi won.

Monaco appeared in a &quot;Maxim&quot; cover feature in 2005, and the magazine also placed her at #13 on their annual Hot 100 List in 2006. 

In February 2009, Monaco expanded her dancing résumé with &quot;Peepshow&quot;, a burlesque act directed by Tony Award-winning director Jerry Mitchell, that plays at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Monaco starred as Bo Peep, a precocious character who discovers her sexuality throughout the show. Monaco starred alongside singer and fellow &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; contestant Melanie Brown, until June 2009, when Monaco&#x27;s contract expired and she was replaced by Holly Madison. The same year, Monaco was named &quot;Maxim&#x27;s&quot; number one sexiest cover model of the decade.

On July 27, 2012, it was announced that Monaco would be participating in the fifteenth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for a chance to win a second mirrorball trophy. This time she was partnered with Valentin Chmerkovskiy. After making the finals for a second time, Monaco finished in third place on November 27, 2012.

In November 2017, Monaco returned to twenty fifth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in week eight, to participate in a trio rumba with Terrell Owens and his professional partner Cheryl Burke.

On August 26, 2024. &quot;Soap Opera Network&quot; announced Monaco had been fired from &quot;General Hospital&quot; following a network decision to &quot;terminate her character&quot;.

==Charity work==
In July 2009, Monaco and several other daytime celebrities traveled to Kenya, Africa, as a part of the Feed the Children program, delivering food and other supplies and visiting schools and orphanages built by Feed the Children.

On October 24, 2009, as part of the iParticipate campaign, Monaco and several of her &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-stars volunteered to help beautify a school in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
When Monaco was a junior in high school, she met Mike Gonzalez, and began a relationship with him. They worked together as lifeguards at a local resort and attended community college together. They remained together for 18 years. They broke up in 2009.

On April 25, 2009, Monaco&#x27;s apartment at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino was ransacked by burglars.

<text>Conor Brady is an Irish journalist, novelist and academic. He was the editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; between 1986 and 2002.

==Early life==

Brady was born in Dublin and spent his early childhood in Tullamore in County Offaly, Ireland. He received his primary education at St. Columba&#x27;s Christian Brothers College, in Tullamore; his secondary education was at the Cistercian College, Roscrea in County Tipperary. At University College Dublin (UCD) he took primary and postgraduate degrees in history and politics. While at UCD he also edited &quot;Campus UCD News&quot;, one of the college&#x27;s two newspapers.

==Press career==

He was the editor of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; and worked both on radio and television with RTE before assuming the Editorship of the prestigious &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 1986.
He joined The Irish Times as a trainee journalist, on graduation from UCD where he had been editor of &quot;Campus,&quot; the college newspaper.
He worked for the newspaper in its Dublin, Belfast and London offices and for a time on the newly-established European Desk.
In 1973,he re-established The Garda Review which had ceased publication and in 1975 was chosen to be one a team of journalists to establish the news features section of RTE under the direction of the legendary Mike Burns.
The fact that he was the first Catholic to be appointed as editor of what was still perceived as a Protestant-oriented newspaper was remarked upon at the time and was seen as part of a process of The Irish Times seeking to broaden its position in Irish society. He was also the first editor to be appointed at the newspaper after a competitive interview process with the participation of staff representatives.

Previously he had been Features Editor, then Night Editor and latterly Deputy Editor. He reported on crime and security and covered events in Northern Ireland before being assigned to the London bureau in the 1970s. Later he worked on the newspaper&#x27;s European Desk and on a number of assignments abroad, including the accession of new member states to the European Economic Community. He reported on the conflict in Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. He was appointed as a director of The Irish Times Ltd in 1985.

Brady was judged to be an excellent editor who increased the newspapers circulation figures to their highest levels over two decades. He positioned the newspaper firmly behind the Northern Ireland peace process while strongly supporting the liberal reform agenda in the Republic.

He focused on developing coverage of foreign news with the establishment of overseas bureaux in Moscow, Beijing, South Africa and elsewhere. He also extended the coverage of arts and books as well as finance and sport. The Irish Times launched its first digital editions during his tenure. He was chair of the World Editors Forum (Paris) 1996–2000 and chair of the Advisory Committee to the European Journalism Centre (Maastricht) 1996–1999.

He retired from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in 2002, after implementing an editorial restructuring of the organisation, necessitated by an accumulation of high costs and a fall in advertising revenues. Editorial numbers dropped by more than 100 as journalists opted for redundancy terms. There was some staff criticism of the parting package agreed between Brady and the company, with some claims that it was over-generous at a time of financial challenge for the organisation. However, The Irish Times subsequently went into a lengthy period of marked financial success, with reduced costs, strong revenues and free of debt. He published his autobiography, entitled &quot;Up with The Times&quot;, in 2005.

Between 2014 and 2019 he wrote a weekly column for the Irish edition of The Sunday Times.

==Academia==

Brady was a visiting professor at John Jay College, City University of New York; Senior Teaching Fellow at Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business, and University College Dublin. In 2020 he was appointed as Honorary Professor in the journalism school of the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG).
In 2023 he was honoured by the National University of Ireland with an honorary doctorate in literature, D.Litt.

==Civic service==
Brady was a member of the Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission from 2005 to 2011. He was chair (2003–2008) of &quot;The British-Irish Association&quot;. He served as a member of the Remembrance Commission, set up under the Good Friday Agreement. In May 2017 he was appointed to be a member of a new commission on the future of policing in Ireland but he resigned in October, citing lack of resources and political commitment. In 2016 he became a member of the Top Level Appointments&#x27; Committee (TLAC) becoming its chair in 2019. TLAC selects leadership for senior public service positions.

He has been a non-executive director of ARC Cancer Support and he has been a director of the Institute of International and European Affairs. He is vice chair of Midlands Radio 103 and co-founder of CaliberAI, a defamation and harm speech technology solutions startup.
In 2022 he was appointed as chair of the board of Esker Arts CLG, a new arts centre to serve the midlands at Tullamore Co Offaly.

==Writer==

Brady has several published books on a range of subjects, from histories of the Irish police force to personal memoirs of his journalistic career.

He has also written a series of crime fiction novel, set in Victorian Dublin and featuring the character of &quot;Detective Sergeant Joe Swallow&quot;, under the titles &quot;A June of Ordinary Murders,&quot; &quot;The Eloquence of the Dead,” “A Hunt in Winter” and “In the Dark River.”

<doc id="719436" wikidata="Q1047863" url="?curid=719436" title="Olsen Gang">
<text>The Olsen Gang (, ) is a Danish comedy film series created by Danish director Erik Balling and special effects expert Henning Bahs about the eponymous fictional criminal gang. The gang&#x27;s leader is the criminal genius and habitual offender Egon Olsen and his accomplices are Benny and Kjeld (Kjell in Norwegian). The gang members are harmless, extremely rarely target ordinary citizens, and never deliberately use violence. The first film came in 1968; during the next thirty years a total of fourteen films were made.

A Norwegian version of the film series was also made (a total of 14 films from 1969 to 1999), in most cases based directly on the scripts for the Danish films. Later, starting in 1981, Sweden also produced their own version: &quot;Jönssonligan&quot;.

== Plot ==
Most of the films start with Egon coming out of jail and being enthusiastically welcomed by Benny and Kjeld. The three men will then have a beer together in the living room of Kjeld&#x27;s home in Valby, where Egon will inform his friends of his latest plan for making them millionaires. Plans are often two-step plans, where the first heist will get the equipment for the real, second plan. The plans usually feature everyday artifacts such as Lego, party balloons, cigarettes, etc., which are then brought together in surprising ways in elaborate and well-timed plans, often including clever social engineering. Benny&#x27;s function in the heists, besides get-away-driver, is picking locks and starting machinery using &quot;The Thing&quot;, a specially shaped brass piece used for manipulating machinery and opening doors. Egon often serves time in prison with lawyers or executives who provide him with the information he needs, such as duty rosters for the national public record office. Egon is also a brilliant safecracker, operating manually, specializing in the fictive &quot;Franz Jäger&quot; brand.

Egon&#x27;s plans often bring the gang into perilously close contact with white-collar criminals from the Danish business (and political) elite. For example, in the ninth installment named &quot;Olsen-banden deruda&quot; well-connected people try to make money out of the so-called &quot;butter mountain&quot;, a huge amount of butter bought up and stored by the EEC (now the EU) to keep prices up. Egon Olsen learns about this from a lawyer who is serving prison time, and the gang interferes with the plan to secure the millions for themselves, but as always, Egon – after having succeeded with a genius plan – fails for a variety of reasons, for instance underestimating the power and unscrupulousness of these people, bad luck, interference from Kjeld&#x27;s wife Yvonne, or other surprising elements. For several films, the role of the antagonist was filled by CEO Hallandsen of the fictive, multinational company Hallandsen Inc. - or variations thereof. Egon is usually arrested in the end, for various reasons: scapegoat, bad luck, some irrelevant crime, or even turning himself in as a matter of honor.

A recurring part of the film is making fun of Danish authorities, especially the police. In some earlier installments, the clumsy Police Inspector Mortensen is used for slapstick comic relief; he is later replaced by Superintendent Jensen, an older, troubled man who has seen better days. He is a resigned character who despises the Danish government as he often criticizes Hallandsen crimes going unnoticed and mentions to his assistant, Inspector Holm: &quot;The only thing the police can do when the real big criminals come by is offer them protection!&quot; Jensen incredulously uses the recurring exclamation &quot;Bagmændene!&quot; (Behind-men/Big Fishes) to reference the in-joke of powerful players moving outside of the law.

In the early installments, profanity and soft-erotica (scantily-clad women) were more freely used than in later ones, where such content was somewhat watered down to suit younger viewers. Later films focused on the satirical interplay between Jensen and Holm and Egon and his crew, with a frequent outburst of anger from Egon. His long list of slurs is especially famous, like &quot;social democrats!&quot;, &quot;insane woman!&quot; (to Yvonne), &quot;lousy amateurs!&quot;, &quot;cowards!&quot;, &quot;dog heads!&quot;, &quot;porridge peasants!&quot;, &quot;sop!&quot;, &quot;scumbags!&quot;, to name a few.

== Characters ==

Recurring characters in the Danish version:
* Egon Olsen: Gang leader, expert safecracker, brilliant but short-tempered and occasionally overdramatic.
* Benny Frandsen: Gang member, get-away driver, always cheerful and handles practical stuff.
* Kjeld Jensen: Gang member, tool master, ever nervous and humble, but does on a rare occasion rise to meet any challenge.
* Yvonne Jensen: Kjeld&#x27;s very bossy wife, often with firm plans on how to use the millions from the various plans.
* Børge Jensen: Kjeld and Yvonne&#x27;s son, occasionally an impeccable part of the schemes.
* Dynamite Harry: Benny&#x27;s brother, explosives expert (at least in his own opinion) and deeply alcoholic.
* Jensen: Superintendent at Copenhagen Police, somewhat disillusioned and mostly forgotten by the brass in his basement office.
* Holm: Detective with Copenhagen Police, young and with high ambitions, but somewhat naive.
* Mortensen: An overambitious but very clumsy inspector with Copenhagen Police appearing in the early films.
* Holm-Hansen/Bang-Johansen/Hallandsen: A role with the same actor playing various villains, always on top of the social hierarchy, most often also with international contacts.
* King and Knight: A confidence trickster and his violent nephew.
* Bøffen (&quot;The Beef&quot;): Enforcer and muscleman for Hallandsen and others.
* Hansen: Rival gang leader with theme music from &quot;Bob le flambeur&quot;.

== International versions ==
The &quot;Olsen Gang&quot; have been made in Norwegian and Swedish (&quot;Jönssonligan&quot;) versions too. While both remakes follow a generally similar formula to the Danish films, the Swedish version diverges considerably from the Danish original in terms of storylines, character development, and overall quality.

=== Norwegian Olsenbanden ===
The Norwegian remakes were, with two exceptions, directed by Knut Bohwim based on Balling and Bahs&#x27;s original scripts with minor adaptations to Norwegian conditions. For example, some names of the main characters were changed: Kjeld became Kjell, Yvonne became Valborg, and Børge became Basse. The character of Benny&#x27;s brother, Dynamite Harry, was used much more often in the Norwegian films than in the original Danish series, with six appearances.

=== Swedish Jönssonligan ===

In the Swedish version, the Egon character is called &quot;Charles-Ingvar &quot;Sickan&quot; Jönsson&quot;, with a slightly different costume and mannerisms, and was a huge success for the actor Gösta Ekman until the actor got tired of the character and left the series. Benny&#x27;s character was named &quot;(Ragnar) Vanheden&quot;, a small-timer from Stockholm, played by Ulf Brunnberg. Kjeld&#x27;s character was named Rocky, but appeared only in the first two films. From the second film, the character Dynamit-Harry played by Björn Gustafson (who has had rather minor parts in the original Danish films) was featured instead. Although starting out as a strict remake, after a while the franchise started writing their own scripts.

The Swedish franchise eventually expanded into films of the band as young kids: &quot;Lilla Jönssonligan&quot; (little Jönsson band) with four features to date.

There was also an attempt to reboot the franchise, featuring brand new actors in the adult roles. &quot;Jönssonligan – Den perfekta stöten&quot; (2015) was released to middling reviews and poor box office.

== Danish films ==
The first thirteen films were directed by Erik Balling, while Tom Hedegaard and Morten Arnfred directed the fourteenth and final &quot;Olsen Gang&quot; film. The scripts were written by Balling and Henning Bahs, who also worked as a production designer.

=== Danish cast ===
* Ove Sprogøe as Egon Olsen
* Morten Grunwald as Benny Frandsen
* Poul Bundgaard as Kjeld Jensen
* Kirsten Walther as Yvonne Jensen
* Jes Holtsø as Børge Jensen
* Axel Strøbye as Superintendent of police Jensen
* Ole Ernst as Police inspector Holm (Dick Kaysø replaces Ernst in one film) 
* Ove Verner Hansen as Bøffen
* Preben Kaas as Dynamite-Harry
* Peter Steen and Jesper Langberg as Mortensen (Steen appeared in two films, Langberg in one film)

=== Spin-offs ===
A Danish TV series and a feature film have been made showing the main characters as children, following the Swedish success of &quot;Lilla Jönssonligan&quot;:
* &quot;Olsen-bandens første kup&quot; (TV series, 1999–2000)
* &quot;Olsen-banden Junior&quot; (2001)

Two animated films have been released in the 2010s:
* &quot;Olsen-banden på de bonede gulve&quot; (&quot;Olsen Gang Gets Polished&quot;, 2010)
* &quot;Olsen-banden på dybt vand&quot; (&quot;The Olsen Gang in Deep Trouble&quot;, 2013)

== Norwegian films ==

* &quot;Olsenbanden Operasjon Egon&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Olsenbanden og Dynamitt-Harry&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Olsenbanden tar gull&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Olsenbanden og Dynamitt-Harry går amok&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Olsenbanden møter Kongen og Knekten&quot; (1974)
* &quot;Olsenbandens siste bedrifter&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Olsenbanden for full musikk&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Olsenbanden og Dynamitt-Harry på sporet&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Olsenbanden og Data-Harry sprenger verdensbanken&quot; (1978)
* &quot;Olsenbanden mot nye høyder&quot; (1979)
* &quot;Olsenbanden gir seg aldri&quot; (1981)
* &quot;Olsenbandens aller siste kupp&quot; (1982)
* &quot;…men Olsenbanden var ikke død&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Olsenbandens siste stikk&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Olsenbanden – Siste skrik!&quot; (2022)

Several elements recur in the film series. As the Japanese carmaker Toyota was usually the main sponsor of the film series, most cars, including the villain&#x27;s cars, the security cars, the police cars, the gang&#x27;s car, civilian cars parked on the sidewalks, etc., were supplied by the company. Models include the Crown as taxis, Toyota Cressida as police cars, Hiace as security vans and money transports, and so on. There have been exceptions, notably &quot;Olsenbandens aller siste kupp&quot; (&quot;The Olsen-Gang&#x27;s Very Last Coup&quot;) from 1982, which was sponsored by Datsun.

In 2022, a film reboot with a new team of actors was released, where the Olsen Gang make plans to steal the painting &quot;The Scream&quot; from the Munch Museum.

=== Norwegian DVDs ===
Most of the Norwegian films have been digitally restored. The discs include English and Norwegian subtitles, 16:9 format and Dolby Digital 1.0 surround sound.

=== Spin-offs ===
The Danish TV series showing the gang during their childhood, &quot;Olsen-bandens første kup&quot;, was remade in Norway as &quot;Olsenbandens første kupp&quot;. There has also been made an entire feature film series, &quot;Olsenbanden Jr.&quot;, with six films from 2003 to 2010, inspired by the Swedish &quot;Lilla Jönssonligan&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===
The popularity of the film series inspired a Norwegian restaurant chain, Egon, with the logo alluding to Egon Olsen&#x27;s iconic hat and cigar.

Semic published five Norwegian comic albums featuring the Olsen Gang, eight original stories, starting with &quot;Olsenbanden raner hurtigruta!&quot; published in 1983.

In June 2019, the Norwegian Postal service issued two stamps to celebrate the first film&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The domestic stamp depicts Egon leaving prison, which is the opening scene in most of the films. The European stamp shows the whole gang, including Harry and Valborg.

The dubbed versions of the series have also enjoyed great popularity in the former GDR and can still be seen regularly on regional television stations. More than 3000 people are members of the German Olsenbanden fan club. The stage name of Betterov, a musician from Thuringia, is a reference to the eponymous supporting character Betterøv in the series.

<doc id="719440" wikidata="Q7715028" url="?curid=719440" title="The Avenues, Salt Lake City">
<text>The Avenues is an affluent neighborhood in Salt Lake City, Utah. It is named after the perfectly gridlike, closely laid out roads called Avenues (numbers, 1st - 18th) and Streets (letters, A - V). First surveyed in the 1850s, the Avenues became Salt Lake City&#x27;s first neighborhood. Today, the Avenues neighborhood is generally considered younger, more progressive, and somewhat &quot;artsy&quot; when compared to other neighborhoods. Many young professionals choose to live there due to the culture and easy commute to downtown.. It is also one of the most important strongholds of the Utah Democratic Party.

==Layout and geography==
The Avenues neighborhood lies on the &quot;north east bench&quot; of the Wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake City. The southern boundary of the Avenues is South Temple Street (1st Avenue is the next street north). Heading north, the Avenues neighborhood is built up onto the lower slopes of the mountains.

The north-south roads in the Avenues, which slope up the hillside, begin at Canyon Road and then are lettered from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;U&quot; Street and then &quot;Virginia Street&quot;, from west to east. The fairly level east-west roads are numbered 1st to 18th Avenues heading northward from South Temple Street. The rigid grid system breaks down around 13th Avenue, as more recent developments farther north have taken a more serpentine bend. The &#x27;major&#x27; streets used more for through-traffic, particularly for their connections at South Temple Street to city arteries, are B, E, I, and Virginia; the &#x27;major&#x27; avenues are 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 13th.

The Avenues lie just northeast of downtown Salt Lake City and just east—over City Creek Canyon—from Capitol Hill. The neighborhood to the east of the lower (below 11th) Avenues, known as Federal Heights, is traditionally thought of as beginning north of South Temple Street and East of Virginia Street. While physically part of the Avenues, the Federal Heights neighborhood may be considered as generally more affluent than the Avenues, with larger, more stately homes. To the north of Federal Heights is a more recently developed area called Arlington Hills. Compared to the neighborhoods to the east, the Avenues are in places quite steep as they climb the foothills to the north.

The large Salt Lake City Cemetery occupies a significant portion of the eastern Avenues below 11th Avenue and abuts Lindsey Gardens (park). To the north of 11th Avenue is the 11th Avenue Park, west of Terrace Hills, a major north-south street leading into the upper Avenues.

The &quot;lower Avenues&quot; (below 11th or 13th) is a neighborhood of mostly older Victorian-era houses, at one time popular with younger homeowners looking for affordable &quot;fixer-uppers&quot;. In recent years a large renovation boom has swept the area. As fixer-uppers are diminishing, it has become less affordable to the younger crowd. There are numerous apartment buildings dotting the lower Avenues also. The Avenues is also especially popular due to its proximity to downtown, the large and remote Memory Grove/City Creek Canyon recreation area to the west, the University of Utah to the east/southeast, and the airport, as well as low traffic and minimal commercial development. The more significant non-residential developments are a supermarket with a few small shops and a State Liquor Store comprising the block between E and F Streets and 5th and 6th Avenue, a few small businesses throughout the Avenues, and the LDS Hospital complex comprising the blocks of 7th Avenue to 9th Avenue between C and D Streets, with additional doctors offices between 9th and 10th Avenue between C and D Streets. Shriners Hospital for Children is located on the east side of Virginia Street bordering 11th Avenue. Popperton Park is at the northeast corner of Virginia and 11th Avenue. A small city library branch is at 9th Avenue and F Street. There are several schools and churches within the Avenues, as well as a large funeral home and mausoleum on the north side of 11th Avenue just west of Virginia street. The Ronald McDonald House is on the north side of South Temple between M and N Streets, where it will soon expand with buildings along the entire block facing South Temple. Other office buildings are found on the north side of South Temple between A Street and Virginia.

==History==

The Avenues was the first section of Salt Lake City to deviate from the original ten acre (40,000 m2) block grid pattern. Blocks were one half the dimension of the original grid, making them 2.5 acres (10,000 m2). Streets and sidewalks were narrower too, meaning that the Avenues&#x27; streets match poorly to the original blocks at the base of the neighborhood along South Temple Street. The first lots were surveyed in the early 1850s, but the Avenues&#x27; deviant platting violated the law. The territorial legislature had to pass a new survey ordinance for the Avenues, which they did in 1860.

Originally, all of the streets were named. North-south streets were named for trees, and east-west streets had names like &quot;Fruit&quot;, &quot;Garden&quot;, &quot;Bluff&quot;, and &quot;Wall&quot; (for what are now 2nd through 5th avenue respectively). By 1885 the north-south streets gained their current alphabetical designations (A Street through V Street, although V was turned into Virginia Street). However, the east-west streets were still known as &quot;Streets&quot;. They were not retitled into &quot;Avenues&quot; until 1907. Up until that time, the area was known as &quot;the dry bench&quot; because it lacked water.

Until 1884, residents in the northeastern Avenues had to haul water for everyday use. Protests prompted the city to install pipelines along 6th Avenue, but those living in the higher Avenues would be without water until 1908.

In spite of water problems, the Avenues proved to be an attractive residential neighborhood. In the southwest Avenues, artisans could live very close to downtown. In the east Avenues, &quot;Butcherville&quot; sprang up after slaughterhouses relocated to the east side in 1860.

Transportation was a major draw for settlement in the Avenues. The Salt Lake Railway Company offered mule and horse-drawn trolley rides in the Avenues by 1872, and the trolleys became electric in 1889. Salt Lake Rapid Transit Company incorporated in 1890 and the companies competed fiercely until merging in 1903. The trolley system expanded to other parts of the city as the Utah Light and Traction Company, but rail lines were denser in the Avenues than any other part of the city save downtown. The tracks were removed in the 1940s after National City Lines acquired (and dismantled) the trolley lines.

At the turn of the century, the neighborhood was a predominantly middle- and upper-middle class trolley suburb, home to many professionals. Developers, including future president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) Heber J. Grant, promoted Avenues home ownership.

The old Primary Children&#x27;s Hospital was located in the avenues.
With the rise of other, more affluent neighborhoods like Federal Heights, the Avenues became less popular. By the 1960s, deterioration was evident as landlords often found it economically advantageous to let properties go neglected. Most homes, built between about 1880 and 1920, showed their age, and the community dealt with increasing problems with transients. In response to these problems, residents formed the Greater Avenues Community Council (GACC) to help revitalize and restore livability to the neighborhood. Today the neighborhood has been revitalized and is considered by many to be one of Salt Lake&#x27;s most desirable neighborhoods.

==Avenues Historic District==

The Avenues Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It included 143 contributing buildings and one contributing site, Brigham Young&#x27;s Grave.

The Barlow House, a brick Queen Anne style house in the district, has a twin that was built out in a rural area, the Amanda Conk Best House in Millcreek, Utah, also NRHP-listed.

Also the Arthur O. Clark House at 1059 East 3rd Avenue, built in 1895, is a mirror copy of the Oscar M. Booth House, built in 1893 in Nephi, Utah by carpenter Oscar M. Booth.

<text>A subregion is a part of a larger geographical region or continent. Cardinal directions are commonly used to define subregions. There are many criteria for creating systems of subregions; this article is focusing on the United Nations geoscheme, which is a changing, constantly updated, UN tool based on specific political geography and demography considerations relevant in UN statistics.

== United Nations subregions ==

The Statistics Division of the United Nations (UN) is in charge of the collection, processing, and dissemination of statistical information for the UN. In 1999, it developed a system of macro-geographical (continental) regions, subregions, and other selected economic groups to report advances towards achieving numerous millennial development goals worldwide. These statistical divisions were devised for statistical purposes and is used for carrying out statistical analysis. The division&#x27;s first publication was the book &quot;World&#x27;s Women 2000: Trends and Statistics&quot; in 2000.
According to the UN, the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories.

== Subregions by continent ==
The following is a non-exhaustive list of subregions, arranged alphabetically by region (i.e., by continent); in the UN geoscheme, higher-level, macro-geographical regions are arranged to the extent possible according to continents.

Sequence used in the list (not all criteria are applied to each continent):

<doc id="719452" wikidata="Q2115165" url="?curid=719452" title="1970 Chilean presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Chile on 4 September 1970. Salvador Allende of the Popular Unity alliance won a narrow plurality in a race against independent Jorge Alessandri and Christian Democrat Radomiro Tomic, before having his victory confirmed by a contingent election after the Christian Democrats voted in favor of his candidacy.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union poured money into this election through their intelligence agencies and other sources, with the former attempting to sabotage Allende and the latter supporting his campaign. Ambassador Edward Korry would play a major role in anti-Allende campaigns during the election.

Eduardo Frei Montalva and his Christian Democratic Party would later unite with Allende&#x27;s opponents to form a congressional majority in an attempt to declare his presidency illegal in August 1973, catalyzing the military coup a few weeks later.

==Electoral system==
The election was held using the absolute majority system, under which a candidate had to receive over 50% of the popular vote to be elected. If no candidate received over 50% of the vote, both houses of the National Congress would come together to vote on the two candidates who received the most votes.

==Campaign==
===Salvador Allende===
Allende was a self-described Marxist and lifetime member of the Chilean Socialist Party. He had a career in politics that included being a senator and three consecutive bids for the presidency prior to the 1970 election cycle. In 1970, he ran for the Popular Unity coalition, a political alliance consisting of the leftists of Chile, including the Chilean Communist Party and Chilean Socialist Party. His platform included 40 promises that would benefit the lower class, including ending inflation, greatly reducing the cost of medicine, and adjusting public housing rent. The remaining promises also aligned with the socialist ideology of Allende and the Popular Unity coalition.

===Radomiro Tomic===
Radomiro Tomic was a major figure in the Christian Democratic Party and served as ambassador to Washington under President Eduardo Frei. As a longtime friend of Frei, he was appointed as an ambassador to position him for candidacy for the party in 1970. He was ideologically to the left of President Frei. He spent a large portion of his political career campaigning for a coalition between Christian Democrats and leftists, despite most members of both groups consistently opposing his idea. He was known for being egotistical but nonetheless a very charismatic speaker. His campaign benefited from the prestige of being ambassador to Washington, as well as his friendship with President Frei. However, it was hurt by his continued insistence on forming a coalition and his direct criticism of the Christian Democratic Party&#x27;s own bills and the Frei administration&#x27;s reforms. Voters often turned away from him due to his confusing campaign platform, which came off as a more convoluted way of implementing socialism compared to electing the Marxist Allende.

===Jorge Alessandri===
Prior to running in the 1970 election, Jorge Alessandri was a career politician and served as the 27th president of Chile from 1958 to 1964, until the constitution barred him from succeeding himself. He was the predecessor to Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. His conservative independent platform represented voters who were concerned by the reforms Frei had implemented over the course of his administration. Due to his prestige as a former president of Chile, his campaign started out very strong. However, over time, he lost support for a variety of reasons.

One major factor was his age and health. At the time of the 1970 election, Alessandri was 74 years old and had experienced a variety of health issues, both mental and physical. According to Sergio Riesenberg, Alessandri&#x27;s appearance on TV backfired and cost him the election. On the TV program &quot;Tres Bandas&quot;, hosted by Gonzalo Bertrán, there were two separate shots that showed him in a bad light. In the first, Alessandri said that he would be determined and that his &quot;hands would not shake,&quot; but the camera focused on his hands, which were actually shaking. In the second frame, he was seen next to a stove warming his legs with a blanket despite it being spring. According to Riesenberg, this gave the public the impression of a man who was no longer of &quot;an adequate age to become president.&quot;

Another major factor was his campaign being staffed mostly by amateurs, which led to the wasting of resources, ineffective propaganda, issues mobilizing supporters, and trouble spreading a positive message to voters. US intelligence reports stated that supporters believed Alessandri could win using his name alone and spent most of the campaign attacking Frei&#x27;s reforms instead of directly promoting Alessandri. In the end, he finished second, meaning that the congressional vote was between him and Allende.

==International involvement==
===Intelligence agencies===
Both the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the KGB spent significant amounts of money to influence the outcome of the election.

The CIA did not provide direct assistance to any candidate, as they had during the 1964 elections, but rather focused on anti-Allende propaganda, and the 40 Committee approved $435,000 for that purpose. In fact, that represented only about half the money spent by the CIA to influence the election; the Church Committee put the total amount at between $800,000 and $1 million. The money approved by the 40 Committee was used in a &quot;scare campaign&quot; of posters and pamphlets linking an Allende victory with the violence and repression associated with the Soviet Union. Editorials and news stories reinforcing this message were also written with CIA guidance, especially in the newspaper &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, and disseminated throughout the national media. The goal was to contribute to and exploit the political polarization and financial panic of the period. Besides propaganda, the CIA also funded an attempt to splinter the Radical Party away from the Popular Unity coalition. This CIA campaign was very inefficient. CIA director Richard Helms complained that he was ordered by the White House to &quot;beat somebody with nobody.&quot; Although the 40 Committee had decided not to support any candidate directly, the CIA did help US companies in funding candidates. In total, US businesses spent about $700,000; half of that sum was provided by the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corporation (ITT).

KGB money was more precisely targeted. Allende made a personal request for Soviet money through his personal contact, KGB officer Svyatoslav Kuznetsov, who urgently came to Chile from Mexico City to help Allende. The original allocation of money for these elections through the KGB was $400,000, and an additional personal subsidy of $50,000 was given directly to Allende. It is believed that help from the KGB was a decisive factor, as Allende won by a narrow margin of 39,000 votes out of a total of 3 million cast. After the elections, the KGB director Yuri Andropov obtained permission for additional money and other resources from the Central Committee of the CPSU to ensure Allende&#x27;s victory in Congress. In his request on 24 October, he stated that the KGB &quot;will carry out measures designed to promote the consolidation of Allende&#x27;s victory and his election to the post of President of the country.&quot;

US president Richard Nixon was enraged by Allende&#x27;s victory and the failure of the CIA&#x27;s covert actions against him.

===US ambassador===

Edward M. Korry was the United States ambassador to Chile from 1967 to 1971, during which he was very involved in Chilean politics, particularly the 1970 elections. During the elections, he spent time analyzing each candidate and their campaigns and would report back to the State Department, making recommendations on how to handle involvement. On many occasions, he expressed that he strongly believed Allende was a major threat to the United States. He believed that an anti-Allende campaign was necessary to prevent the formation of a Leninist state in Chile and even advocated for its expansion throughout the election. A major basis for expanding it was the trends occurring in the election, namely the rapid decline of Alessandri&#x27;s campaign, the continued stagnation of Tomic&#x27;s, and the growing support for Allende, much of which came from voters moving away from Alessandri and Tomic. He did not believe that the people of Chile or US private businesses would be able to do enough to stop Allende&#x27;s election.

Korry was very actively involved with the Christian Democrats and the Frei administration, quickly developing a close relationship with Frei. At the request of Frei, he became more directly involved in Tomic&#x27;s campaign, as Frei was becoming frustrated with Tomic&#x27;s frequent criticism of the party he was running for, as well as his increasingly leftist views. One major point of involvement was attempting to stop Tomic from continuing to advocate for an alliance with the Soviet Union. Over time, Korry would become frustrated with Tomic as well, a bad sign for US relations if Tomic had become president.

Korry was later accused of involvement in the 1973 coup due to his vocal criticism of Allende, despite not being involved, with his innocence only being acknowledged by major media outlets in 1981. He strongly opposed any military intervention in Chile, both immediately after the election and three years later when Pinochet came to power.

=== Track I and Track II ===
The United States executive branch had two plans to prevent Allende from ascending to power if he won the vote. Track I was led by the State Department and involved manipulation of Chilean politics within the bounds of the Chilean constitution to lead to President Frei being re-elected. The CIA was not involved with it. Track II, or Project FUBELT, was a CIA operation that did not involve the State Department or Department of Defense, consisting of forming and supporting a group within the Chilean military who would stage a coup. Circumstantially, Track I was not possible, so the United States moved forward with Project FUBELT.

==Results==
As none of the candidates received an absolute majority in the public vote, the National Congress had to decide between the two candidates who had received the most votes: Allende and Alessandri. In the three previous instances since 1932 where this situation had arisen, Congress had simply chosen the candidate with the highest number of votes. Former President Alessandri, in fact, had been elected in 1958 with 31.6% of the popular vote, defeating Allende.

However, in this case, there was an active campaign against Allende&#x27;s confirmation by Congress, including an intensified propaganda effort by the CIA to raise concerns about Chile&#x27;s future. During this period, the CIA produced over 726 articles, broadcasts, and similar items. The CIA also encouraged international economic pressure against Chile. Additionally, the United States began laying the groundwork for a military coup, authorizing the Ambassador to Chile to promote this outcome through his contacts in the Chilean military.

In the summer before the election, reports indicated that out of the 200 senators and deputies in Congress, Allende had 82 supporters, including the 80 members of Popular Unity, a major organizing force in the coalition. Tomic had 75 supporters following Allende, while Alessandri&#x27;s remaining supporters amounted to 43 out of the 200 congresspeople.

Two days prior to the confirmation, Army Commander-in-Chief General René Schneider was shot while resisting a kidnapping attempt by a group led by General Roberto Viaux. Schneider, hospitalized as a result, succumbed to his wounds three days later. The CIA had supported Viaux&#x27;s kidnapping plan through Project FUBELT. Schneider was known for defending the &quot;constitutionalist&quot; doctrine, which held that the army&#x27;s role is exclusively professional and aimed at protecting the country&#x27;s sovereignty, not interfering in politics. He had vehemently opposed organizing a coup d&#x27;état if Salvador Allende was ultimately chosen by the National Congress as president.

Schneider&#x27;s death was viewed unfavorably by the public and rallied citizens and military personnel in support of Allende. Ultimately, on 24 October, the National Congress chose Allende as the President. On 26 October, President Eduardo Frei appointed General Carlos Prats as the new commander in chief of the army, succeeding René Schneider. Prats himself resigned in August 1973, and Allende appointed Augusto Pinochet, then presumed to be loyal to Allende, as his successor; a few weeks later, Pinochet would overthrow Allende in the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état and lead the resulting military junta.

Allende&#x27;s presidency was eventually ratified after he agreed to sign a &quot;Statute of Constitutional Guarantees,&quot; pledging not to undermine the constitution.

He was also a descendant of Jellis Douwese Fonda, who emigrated in 1642 to the Dutch colony of New Netherland (New York).

His uncle was Charles Yates, a Brigadier-General during the American Civil War. Charles&#x27; daughter, Stella Yates (November 23, 1866 - February 2, 1929), married on June 10, 1891, in New York City, Benjamin Brewster, the son of the Rev. Joseph Brewster and Sarah Jane Bunce. He was the Episcopal Bishop of Maine and Missionary Bishop of Western Colorado.

He graduated from Columbia University in 1863, and in 1866 graduated from the General Theological Seminary, New York City.

===Marriage and personal life===
He married on June 30, 1866, Jane Lawrence Churchill, the daughter of Timothy Gridley Churchill and Patience Lawrence. They were the parents of two children. Their son, the Rev. Churchill Satterlee, was a clergyman of the Episcopal Church. Their daughter, Constance Satterlee, married Frederick W. Rhinelander, the brother of Philip M.

<doc id="719454" wikidata="Q741432" url="?curid=719454" title="Old Shatterhand">
<text>Old Shatterhand is a fictional character in Western novels by German writer Karl May (1842–1912). He is the German friend and blood brother of Winnetou, the fictional chief of the Mescalero tribe of the Apache. He is the main character in the Eurowestern by the same name from 1964, starring Lex Barker, as well as in six more films of the Winnetou film series.

== Characterisation ==
Old Shatterhand is the alter ego of Karl May, and May himself maintained that he experienced all the adventures in person, even though in fact he did not visit America until after he wrote most of his well-known Western stories, and never traveled west of Buffalo, New York. Most of the stories are written from a first person perspective, and Winnetou often calls Old Shatterhand &quot;my brother Scharli&quot; (&#x27;Scharli&#x27; being a German phonetic approximation of &#x27;Charlie&#x27;, and ultimately meaning Karl in German). May also wrote stories about the same character traveling the Orient, where he is known as Kara Ben Nemsi.

May attached the prefix &quot;Old&quot; to the names of several of his characters, considering it to be typically American and a sign of the characters&#x27; great experience. In the stories, Old Shatterhand is given the name by his friend Sam Hawkens (who also originates from Germany but is already an old-timer in the American West), as Old Shatterhand was able to knock his opponents unconscious with a single punch from his fist aimed at the head (specifically the temple).
Old Shatterhand owns two famous rifles, the &quot;Bärentöter&quot; (Bear Killer) and the &quot;Henrystutzen&quot; (Henry carbine), both made by a fictional gunsmith called Henry in St. Louis (based on gunsmith Benjamin Tyler Henry 1821–1898). The &quot;Henrystutzen&quot; was able to fire 25 shots without reloading, probably a hyperbolic reference to the Henry rifle. Old Shatterhand rode a horse called &quot;Hatatitla&quot; (Lightning), which he got from Winnetou, who rode the horse&#x27;s brother, called &quot;Iltschi&quot; (meaning Wind).

The tales may have been an influence on the creation of the Lone Ranger media franchise. Christian Tramitz parodied Shatterhand as a character called Ranger in the &quot;Apahachi and Ranger&quot; sketches for Michael Herbig&#x27;s comedy show &quot;Bullyparade&quot; and their cinematic adaptation &quot;Der Schuh des Manitu&quot;.

== Movies ==
The character of Old Shatterhand was played in the German Karl May movies of the 1960s by American actor Lex Barker.
* &quot;Der Schatz im Silbersee&quot; (&quot;The Treasure of Silver Lake&quot;) (1962), dir.: Dr. Harald Reinl
* &quot;Winnetou 1. Teil&quot; (&quot;Apache Gold&quot;) (1963), dir.: Dr. Harald Reinl

In contrast to the stories in the movies &quot;Unter Geiern&quot; (1964) and &quot;Der Ölprinz&quot; (1965) Old Surehand (starring Stewart Granger) was the hero instead of Old Shatterhand. Old Surehand is another character created by Karl May. Karl May dedicated three volumes to him, who, like Old Shatterhand, is a renowned Western hero and best friends with the Native Americans. Unlike Old Shatterhand, Old Surehand is a half-blood Native himself, though raised in a white family.

== Sequels ==
In the 1990s British writer B. J. Holmes produced two sequels featuring the character: &quot;A Legend Called Shatterhand&quot;, and &quot;Shatterhand and the People&quot;.

<text>John Robert Mize (January 7, 1913 – June 2, 1993), nicknamed &quot;Big Jawn&quot; and &quot;the Big Cat&quot;, was an American professional baseball player, coach and scout. He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 15 seasons between 1936 and 1953, losing three seasons to military service during World War II. Mize was a ten-time All-Star who played for the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants, and the New York Yankees. During his tenure with the Yankees, the team won five consecutive World Series.

Mize retired in 1953 with 359 career home runs and a .312 batting average along with 1,118 runs, 2,011 hits, 367 doubles, 83 triples, 1,337 RBI and 856 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .992 fielding percentage as a first baseman. He served as a radio commentator, scout and coach in the major leagues after he retired as a player. He was selected for induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1981. In 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum.

==Early life and career==
Mize was born in Demorest, Georgia to Edward and Emma Mize. After his parents separated, his mother went to Atlanta for work, but Mize remained in Demorest with his grandmother. He excelled in tennis as a child and played on his high school baseball team. He later played baseball for Piedmont College. Mize was a cousin of Ty Cobb and his second cousin married Babe Ruth.

Mize came up through the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system but was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in 1934. However, he suffered a groin injury and the Reds nullified the trade. In 1935, while struggling with one bad leg, he injured the other leg. Mize retired from baseball and returned home until the Cardinals asked him to see a physician in St. Louis. He had surgery for bone spurs.

He was kept with the Cardinals in St. Louis after surgery, as he would not have been able to play regularly that season in the minor leagues anyway. The organization thought that he might get some opportunities to pinch hit with the major league team. Mize made his major league debut for the Cardinals in 1936. In 126 games, Mize hit for a .329 batting average, 19 home runs and 93 runs batted in (RBI). He later said, &quot;I&#x27;m the only guy who played in the major leagues because I couldn&#x27;t play in the minors.&quot;

==Early MLB career==

Mize was known as both &quot;Big Jawn&quot; and &quot;The Big Cat&quot; for his smooth fielding at first base. In 1937 he batted .364, but Cardinals teammate Joe Medwick took the title with a .374 average. He led the league in triples and OPS in 1938. In 1939, Mize finished second in the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting after leading the league with a .349 average and 28 home runs. Mize&#x27;s 43 home runs in 1940 set a Cardinals team record that stood for nearly 60 years. At the end of the 1941 season, however, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey, who believed in trading players before their skills began to decline, traded Mize to the New York Giants. In exchange for Mize, the Cardinals received Bill Lohrman, Johnny McCarthy, Ken O&#x27;Dea, and $50,000.

Mize was involved in a 1941 lawsuit against Gum Products Inc. The company manufactured a set of baseball cards called Double Play. Mize sued because he argued that the company did not have his consent to use his image in the card set. Gum Products Inc. won the lawsuit, but the company stopped producing its Double Play series because of the expenses it incurred during the legal proceedings with Mize.

The Giants pursued Mize after learning that their first baseman, Babe Young, was going to be forced into military service. In 1942, Mize hit for his lowest batting average to that point in his career (.305), but he hit 26 home runs and led the NL with 110 RBI.

==Military service and later career==

Mize spent 1943 through 1945 in military service during World War II. During his service he played for the Great Lakes Naval Station baseball team for service members and new personnel in training. Mize hit 17 home runs in 51 games and batted over .475 while manning first base for the Bluejackets. Other team members included: Phil Rizzuto who belonged to the Yankees; outfielders Sam Chapman, Dom DiMaggio and Barney McCosky; Frankie Pytlak; and Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese, and Johnny Lipon. The team was considered one of the best WWII era teams assembled.

Returning to the Giants in 1946, a broken toe caused him to fall one short of the home run title, won by Ralph Kiner of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1947 he rebounded to hit 51 home runs and tie Kiner for the league lead. He also led in runs and RBI, and became the only player to strike out fewer than fifty times while hitting fifty home runs. Mize&#x27;s 1947 totals in runs, home runs and RBI were all career highs. In 1948, Mize and Kiner again tied for the league home run championship with 40 each. Mize was traded to the New York Yankees late in the 1949 season after expressing discontent with his playing time.

Mize spent the last five years of his career with the Yankees, mostly as a part-time player, ending in 1953. He was, however, considered a valuable contributor to their winning five consecutive American League pennants and World Series titles. Despite spending part of the 1950 season on minor league rehab, he hit 25 home runs to become the second player to have a 25-home run season in both leagues. In the 1952 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers, he hit three home runs, one as a pinch-hitter, and was robbed of a fourth by Dodger right fielder Carl Furillo, who made a leaping catch above the fence in the 11th inning to preserve a win for the Dodgers.

In October 1953, Mize announced his retirement. He said that he would rather retire while he was still popular with fans than to &quot;hang around until they start to boo.&quot; Mize holds the major league record for the most times hitting three homers in one game, a feat he performed six times. He also was one of a handful of players (including Babe Ruth) to do it in both leagues — five times in the National League and once in the American. He was the first player to hit three home runs in a game twice in one season in 1938 and did it twice again in 1940. He finished his career with 359 home runs.

Mize still holds Cardinals team records for most home runs in a season by a left-handed batter, most season RBI by a left hander, and most games with three or more home runs with 6. He and Carl Yastrzemski are the only players to have three seasons of hitting 40 or more home runs, without a season of hitting between 30 and 39 home runs.

Mize was a strong pinch hitter in his MLB career, posting a .292 batting average (52-for-178) with 7 home runs and 56 RBI in 215 pinch-hitting appearances.

==Later life==
After his 1953 retirement, Mize worked as a radio commentator, scout and a hitting coach for the New York / San Francisco Giants (1955–60). He coached the Kansas City Athletics in 1961.

In the 1970s, Mize made his home in St. Augustine, Florida, working for a development by the Deltona Corporation called St. Augustine Shores. A picture of his house is included in David Nolan&#x27;s book &quot;The Houses of St. Augustine&quot;. He was chosen by the Veterans Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981. He had appeared on the regular Hall of Fame ballot in the 1960s and 1970s, where his highest vote percentage had been 43% in 1971.

Mize spent the last few years of his life at his home in Demorest, Georgia. He underwent heart surgery in 1982 but returned to good health. He died in his sleep of cardiac arrest in 1993.

==Legacy==
Upon Mize&#x27;s death, Ralph Kiner described him as &quot;kind of an irascible guy&quot; on the field, but &quot;a very affable guy and a great storyteller&quot; off the field. Mize&#x27;s batting statistics were overshadowed by those of bigger stars of his era such as Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, and Jackie Robinson. Mize&#x27;s lifetime on-base percentage of .397 has become more appreciated in the light of sabermetric analysis.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Mize as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Mize among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. The Johnny Mize Baseball Museum is located at Piedmont College. The college also honors the slugger with the Johnny Mize Athletic Center, a sports complex that houses the school&#x27;s basketball arena.

<doc id="719460" wikidata="Q1153324" url="?curid=719460" title="Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector">
<text>In classical mechanics, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector (LRL vector) is a vector used chiefly to describe the shape and orientation of the orbit of one astronomical body around another, such as a binary star or a planet revolving around a star. For two bodies interacting by Newtonian gravity, the LRL vector is a constant of motion, meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit; equivalently, the LRL vector is said to be &quot;conserved&quot;. More generally, the LRL vector is conserved in all problems in which two bodies interact by a central force that varies as the inverse square of the distance between them; such problems are called Kepler problems.

The hydrogen atom is a Kepler problem, since it comprises two charged particles interacting by Coulomb&#x27;s law of electrostatics, another inverse-square central force. The LRL vector was essential in the first quantum mechanical derivation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, before the development of the Schrödinger equation. However, this approach is rarely used today.

In classical and quantum mechanics, conserved quantities generally correspond to a symmetry of the system. The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry; the Kepler problem is mathematically equivalent to a particle moving freely on the surface of a four-dimensional (hyper-)sphere, so that the whole problem is symmetric under certain rotations of the four-dimensional space. This higher symmetry results from two properties of the Kepler problem: the velocity vector always moves in a perfect circle and, for a given total energy, all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points.

The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is named after Pierre-Simon de Laplace, Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz. It is also known as the Laplace vector, the Runge–Lenz vector and the Lenz vector. Ironically, none of those scientists discovered it. The LRL vector has been re-discovered and re-formulated several times; for example, it is equivalent to the dimensionless eccentricity vector of celestial mechanics. Various generalizations of the LRL vector have been defined, which incorporate the effects of special relativity, electromagnetic fields and even different types of central forces.

==Context==
A single particle moving under any conservative central force has at least four constants of motion: the total energy and the three Cartesian components of the angular momentum vector with respect to the center of force. The particle&#x27;s orbit is confined to the plane defined by the particle&#x27;s initial momentum (or, equivalently, its velocity ) and the vector between the particle and the center of force (see Figure 1). This plane of motion is perpendicular to the constant angular momentum vector ; this may be expressed mathematically by the vector dot product equation . Given its mathematical definition below, the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector (LRL vector) is always perpendicular to the constant angular momentum vector for all central forces (). Therefore, always lies in the plane of motion. As shown below, points from the center of force to the periapsis of the motion, the point of closest approach, and its length is proportional to the eccentricity of the orbit.

The LRL vector is constant in length and direction, but only for an inverse-square central force. For other central forces, the vector is not constant, but changes in both length and direction. If the central force is &quot;approximately&quot; an inverse-square law, the vector is approximately constant in length, but slowly rotates its direction. A &quot;generalized&quot; conserved LRL vector formula_1 can be defined for all central forces, but this generalized vector is a complicated function of position, and usually not expressible in closed form.

The LRL vector differs from other conserved quantities in the following property. Whereas for typical conserved quantities, there is a corresponding cyclic coordinate in the three-dimensional Lagrangian of the system, there does &quot;not&quot; exist such a coordinate for the LRL vector. Thus, the conservation of the LRL vector must be derived directly, e.g., by the method of Poisson brackets, as described below. Conserved quantities of this kind are called &quot;dynamic&quot;, in contrast to the usual &quot;geometric&quot; conservation laws, e.g., that of the angular momentum.

== History of rediscovery ==
The LRL vector is a constant of motion of the Kepler problem, and is useful in describing astronomical orbits, such as the motion of planets and binary stars. Nevertheless, it has never been well known among physicists, possibly because it is less intuitive than momentum and angular momentum. Consequently, it has been rediscovered independently several times over the last three centuries.

Jakob Hermann was the first to show that is conserved for a special case of the inverse-square central force, and worked out its connection to the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse. Hermann&#x27;s work was generalized to its modern form by Johann Bernoulli in 1710. At the end of the century, Pierre-Simon de Laplace rediscovered the conservation of , deriving it analytically, rather than geometrically. In the middle of the nineteenth century, William Rowan Hamilton derived the equivalent eccentricity vector defined below, using it to show that the momentum vector moves on a circle for motion under an inverse-square central force (Figure 3).

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Josiah Willard Gibbs derived the same vector by vector analysis. Gibbs&#x27; derivation was used as an example by Carl Runge in a popular German textbook on vectors, which was referenced by Wilhelm Lenz in his paper on the (old) quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom. In 1926, Wolfgang Pauli used the LRL vector to derive the energy levels of the hydrogen atom using the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics, after which it became known mainly as the &quot;Runge–Lenz vector&quot;.

== Definition ==
An inverse-square central force acting on a single particle is described by the equation 
formula_2
The corresponding potential energy is given by formula_3. The constant parameter describes the strength of the central force; it is equal to for gravitational and for electrostatic forces. The force is attractive if and repulsive if .

The LRL vector is defined mathematically by the formula
,&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
where
* is the mass of the point particle moving under the central force,
* is its momentum vector,
* is its angular momentum vector,
* is the position vector of the particle (Figure 1),
* formula_4 is the corresponding unit vector, i.e., formula_5, and
* is the magnitude of , the distance of the mass from the center of force.

The SI units of the LRL vector are joule-kilogram-meter (J⋅kg⋅m). This follows because the units of and are kg⋅m/s and J⋅s, respectively. This agrees with the units of (kg) and of (N⋅m2).

This definition of the LRL vector pertains to a single point particle of mass moving under the action of a fixed force. However, the same definition may be extended to two-body problems such as the Kepler problem, by taking as the reduced mass of the two bodies and as the vector between the two bodies.

Since the assumed force is conservative, the total energy is a constant of motion,
formula_6

The assumed force is also a central force. Hence, the angular momentum vector is also conserved and defines the plane in which the particle travels. The LRL vector is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector because both and are perpendicular to . It follows that lies in the plane of motion.

Alternative formulations for the same constant of motion may be defined, typically by scaling the vector with constants, such as the mass , the force parameter or the angular momentum . The most common variant is to divide by , which yields the eccentricity vector, a dimensionless vector along the semi-major axis whose modulus equals the eccentricity of the conic:
formula_7
An equivalent formulation multiplies this eccentricity vector by the major semiaxis , giving the resulting vector the units of length. Yet another formulation divides by formula_8, yielding an equivalent conserved quantity with units of inverse length, a quantity that appears in the solution of the Kepler problem
formula_9
where formula_10 is the angle between and the position vector . Further alternative formulations are given below.

== Derivation of the Kepler orbits ==
The &quot;shape&quot; and &quot;orientation&quot; of the orbits can be determined from the LRL vector as follows. Taking the dot product of with the position vector gives the equation
formula_11
where is the angle between and (Figure 2). Permuting the scalar triple product yields
formula_12

Rearranging yields the solution for the Kepler equation
 \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}

This corresponds to the formula for a conic section of eccentricity &quot;e&quot;
formula_13
where the eccentricity formula_14 and is a constant.

Taking the dot product of with itself yields an equation involving the total energy ,
formula_15
which may be rewritten in terms of the eccentricity,
formula_16

Thus, if the energy is negative (bound orbits), the eccentricity is less than one and the orbit is an ellipse. Conversely, if the energy is positive (unbound orbits, also called &quot;scattered orbits&quot;), the eccentricity is greater than one and the orbit is a hyperbola. Finally, if the energy is exactly zero, the eccentricity is one and the orbit is a parabola. In all cases, the direction of lies along the symmetry axis of the conic section and points from the center of force toward the periapsis, the point of closest approach.

== Circular momentum hodographs ==
The conservation of the LRL vector and angular momentum vector is useful in showing that the momentum vector moves on a circle under an inverse-square central force.

Taking the dot product of
formula_17
with itself yields
formula_18

Further choosing along the -axis, and the major semiaxis as the -axis, yields the locus equation for ,
In other words, the momentum vector is confined to a circle of radius centered on . For bounded orbits, the eccentricity corresponds to the cosine of the angle shown in Figure 3. For unbounded orbits, we have formula_19 and so the circle does not intersect the formula_20-axis.

In the degenerate limit of circular orbits, and thus vanishing , the circle centers at the origin .
For brevity, it is also useful to introduce the variable formula_21.

This circular hodograph is useful in illustrating the symmetry of the Kepler problem.

== Constants of motion and superintegrability ==
The seven scalar quantities , and (being vectors, the latter two contribute three conserved quantities each) are related by two equations, and , giving five independent constants of motion. (Since the magnitude of , hence the eccentricity of the orbit, can be determined from the total angular momentum and the energy , only the &quot;direction&quot; of is conserved independently; moreover, since must be perpendicular to , it contributes &quot;only one&quot; additional conserved quantity.)

This is consistent with the six initial conditions (the particle&#x27;s initial position and velocity vectors, each with three components) that specify the orbit of the particle, since the initial time is not determined by a constant of motion. The resulting 1-dimensional orbit in 6-dimensional phase space is thus completely specified.

A mechanical system with degrees of freedom can have at most constants of motion, since there are initial conditions and the initial time cannot be determined by a constant of motion. A system with more than constants of motion is called &quot;superintegrable&quot; and a system with constants is called maximally superintegrable. Since the solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in one coordinate system can yield only constants of motion, superintegrable systems must be separable in more than one coordinate system. The Kepler problem is maximally superintegrable, since it has three degrees of freedom () and five independent constant of motion; its Hamilton–Jacobi equation is separable in both spherical coordinates and parabolic coordinates, as described below.

Maximally superintegrable systems follow closed, one-dimensional orbits in phase space, since the orbit is the intersection of the phase-space isosurfaces of their constants of motion. Consequently, the orbits are perpendicular to all gradients of all these independent isosurfaces, five in this specific problem, and hence are determined by the generalized cross products of all of these gradients. As a result, all superintegrable systems are automatically describable by Nambu mechanics, alternatively, and equivalently, to Hamiltonian mechanics.

Maximally superintegrable systems can be quantized using commutation relations, as illustrated below. Nevertheless, equivalently, they are also quantized in the Nambu framework, such as this classical Kepler problem into the quantum hydrogen atom.

== Evolution under perturbed potentials ==
The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is conserved only for a perfect inverse-square central force. In most practical problems such as planetary motion, however, the interaction potential energy between two bodies is not exactly an inverse square law, but may include an additional central force, a so-called &quot;perturbation&quot; described by a potential energy . In such cases, the LRL vector rotates slowly in the plane of the orbit, corresponding to a slow apsidal precession of the orbit.

By assumption, the perturbing potential is a conservative central force, which implies that the total energy and angular momentum vector are conserved. Thus, the motion still lies in a plane perpendicular to and the magnitude is conserved, from the equation . The perturbation potential may be any sort of function, but should be significantly weaker than the main inverse-square force between the two bodies.

The &quot;rate&quot; at which the LRL vector rotates provides information about the perturbing potential . Using canonical perturbation theory and action-angle coordinates, it is straightforward to show that rotates at a rate of,
formula_22
where is the orbital period, and the identity was used to convert the time integral into an angular integral (Figure 5). The expression in angular brackets, , represents the perturbing potential, but &quot;averaged&quot; over one full period; that is, averaged over one full passage of the body around its orbit. Mathematically, this time average corresponds to the following quantity in curly braces. This averaging helps to suppress fluctuations in the rate of rotation.

This approach was used to help verify Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, which adds a small effective inverse-cubic perturbation to the normal Newtonian gravitational potential,
formula_23

Inserting this function into the integral and using the equation
formula_24
to express in terms of , the precession rate of the periapsis caused by this non-Newtonian perturbation is calculated to be
formula_25
which closely matches the observed anomalous precession of Mercury and binary pulsars. This agreement with experiment is strong evidence for general relativity.

== Poisson brackets ==
=== Unscaled functions ===
The algebraic structure of the problem is, as explained in later sections, .
The three components &quot;Li&quot; of the angular momentum vector have the Poisson brackets
formula_26
where =1,2,3 and is the fully antisymmetric tensor, i.e., the Levi-Civita symbol; the summation index is used here to avoid confusion with the force parameter defined above. Then since the LRL vector transforms like a vector, we have the following Poisson bracket relations between and :
formula_27 
Finally, the Poisson bracket relations between the different components of are as follows:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the Hamiltonian. Note that the span of the components of and the components of is not closed under Poisson brackets, because of the factor of formula_29 on the right-hand side of this last relation.

Finally, since both and are constants of motion, we have
formula_31

The Poisson brackets will be extended to quantum mechanical commutation relations in the next section and to Lie brackets in a following section.

=== Scaled functions ===
As noted below, a scaled Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector may be defined with the same units as angular momentum by dividing by formula_32. Since still transforms like a vector, the Poisson brackets of with the angular momentum vector can then be written in a similar form
formula_33

The Poisson brackets of with &quot;itself&quot; depend on the sign of , i.e., on whether the energy is negative (producing closed, elliptical orbits under an inverse-square central force) or positive (producing open, hyperbolic orbits under an inverse-square central force). For &quot;negative&quot; energies—i.e., for bound systems—the Poisson brackets are
formula_34
We may now appreciate the motivation for the chosen scaling of : With this scaling, the Hamiltonian no longer appears on the right-hand side of the preceding relation. Thus, the span of the three components of and the three components of forms a six-dimensional Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket. This Lie algebra is isomorphic to , the Lie algebra of the 4-dimensional rotation group .

By contrast, for &quot;positive&quot; energy, the Poisson brackets have the opposite sign,
formula_35
In this case, the Lie algebra is isomorphic to .

The distinction between positive and negative energies arises because the desired scaling—the one that eliminates the Hamiltonian from the right-hand side of the Poisson bracket relations between the components of the scaled LRL vector—involves the &quot;square root&quot; of the Hamiltonian. To obtain real-valued functions, we must then take the absolute value of the Hamiltonian, which distinguishes between positive values (where formula_36) and negative values (where formula_37).

=== Laplace-Runge-Lenz operator for the hydrogen atom in momentum space ===
Scaled Laplace-Runge-Lenz operator in the momentum space was found in 2022 . The formula for the operator is simpler than in position space:
: formula_38
where the &quot;degree operator&quot; 
: formula_39
multiplies a homogeneous polynomial by its degree.

=== Casimir invariants and the energy levels ===
The Casimir invariants for negative energies are
formula_40
and have vanishing Poisson brackets with all components of and ,
formula_41
&quot;C&quot;2 is trivially zero, since the two vectors are always perpendicular.

However, the other invariant, &quot;C&quot;1, is non-trivial and depends only on , and . Upon canonical quantization, this invariant allows the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms to be derived using only quantum mechanical canonical commutation relations, instead of the conventional solution of the Schrödinger equation. This derivation is discussed in detail in the next section.

== Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom ==


Poisson brackets provide a simple guide for quantizing most classical systems: the commutation relation of two quantum mechanical operators is specified by the Poisson bracket of the corresponding classical variables, multiplied by .

By carrying out this quantization and calculating the eigenvalues of the 1 Casimir operator for the Kepler problem, Wolfgang Pauli was able to derive the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (Figure 6) and, thus, their atomic emission spectrum. This elegant 1926 derivation was obtained &quot;before the development of the Schrödinger equation&quot;.

A subtlety of the quantum mechanical operator for the LRL vector is that the momentum and angular momentum operators do not commute; hence, the quantum operator cross product of and must be defined carefully. Typically, the operators for the Cartesian components are defined using a symmetrized (Hermitian) product,
formula_42
Once this is done, one can show that the quantum LRL operators satisfy commutations relations exactly analogous to the Poisson bracket relations in the previous section—just replacing the Poisson bracket with formula_43 times the commutator.

From these operators, additional ladder operators for can be defined,
formula_44
These further connect &quot;different&quot; eigenstates of , so different spin multiplets, among themselves.

A normalized first Casimir invariant operator, quantum analog of the above, can likewise be defined,
formula_45
where is the inverse of the Hamiltonian energy operator, and is the identity operator.

Applying these ladder operators to the eigenstates |&quot;ℓ&quot;〉 of the total angular momentum, azimuthal angular momentum and energy operators, the eigenvalues of the first Casimir operator, 1, are seen to be quantized, . Importantly, by dint of the vanishing of &quot;C&quot;2, they are independent of the ℓ and quantum numbers, making the energy levels degenerate.

Hence, the energy levels are given by
formula_46
which coincides with the Rydberg formula for hydrogen-like atoms (Figure 6). The additional symmetry operators have connected the different ℓ multiplets among themselves, for a given energy (and &quot;C&quot;1), dictating states at each level. In effect, they have enlarged the angular momentum group to .

== Conservation and symmetry ==
The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to a subtle symmetry of the system. In classical mechanics, symmetries are continuous operations that map one orbit onto another without changing the energy of the system; in quantum mechanics, symmetries are continuous operations that &quot;mix&quot; electronic orbitals of the same energy, i.e., degenerate energy levels. A conserved quantity is usually associated with such symmetries. For example, every central force is symmetric under the rotation group SO(3), leading to the conservation of the angular momentum . Classically, an overall rotation of the system does not affect the energy of an orbit; quantum mechanically, rotations mix the spherical harmonics of the same quantum number without changing the energy.

The symmetry for the inverse-square central force is higher and more subtle. The peculiar symmetry of the Kepler problem results in the conservation of both the angular momentum vector and the LRL vector (as defined above) and, quantum mechanically, ensures that the energy levels of hydrogen do not depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers and . The symmetry is more subtle, however, because the symmetry operation must take place in a higher-dimensional space; such symmetries are often called &quot;hidden symmetries&quot;.

Classically, the higher symmetry of the Kepler problem allows for continuous alterations of the orbits that preserve energy but not angular momentum; expressed another way, orbits of the same energy but different angular momentum (eccentricity) can be transformed continuously into one another. Quantum mechanically, this corresponds to mixing orbitals that differ in the and quantum numbers, such as the () and () atomic orbitals. Such mixing cannot be done with ordinary three-dimensional translations or rotations, but is equivalent to a rotation in a higher dimension.

For &quot;negative&quot; energies – i.e., for bound systems – the higher symmetry group is , which preserves the length of four-dimensional vectors
formula_47

In 1935, Vladimir Fock showed that the quantum mechanical bound Kepler problem is equivalent to the problem of a free particle confined to a three-dimensional unit sphere in four-dimensional space. Specifically, Fock showed that the Schrödinger wavefunction in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the stereographic projection of the spherical harmonics on the sphere. Rotation of the sphere and re-projection results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy, an symmetry sometimes known as Fock symmetry; quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number . Valentine Bargmann noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector and the scaled LRL vector formed the Lie algebra for . Simply put, the six quantities and correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions, associated with the six possible simple rotations in that space (there are six ways of choosing two axes from four). This conclusion does not imply that our universe is a three-dimensional sphere; it merely means that this particular physics problem (the two-body problem for inverse-square central forces) is &quot;mathematically equivalent&quot; to a free particle on a three-dimensional sphere.

For &quot;positive&quot; energies – i.e., for unbound, &quot;scattered&quot; systems – the higher symmetry group is , which preserves the Minkowski length of 4-vectors
formula_48

Both the negative- and positive-energy cases were considered by Fock and Bargmann and have been reviewed encyclopedically by Bander and Itzykson.

The orbits of central-force systems – and those of the Kepler problem in particular – are also symmetric under reflection. Therefore, the , and groups cited above are not the full symmetry groups of their orbits; the full groups are , , and O(3,1), respectively. Nevertheless, only the connected subgroups, , , and , are needed to demonstrate the conservation of the angular momentum and LRL vectors; the reflection symmetry is irrelevant for conservation, which may be derived from the Lie algebra of the group.

== Rotational symmetry in four dimensions ==
The connection between the Kepler problem and four-dimensional rotational symmetry can be readily visualized. Let the four-dimensional Cartesian coordinates be denoted where represent the Cartesian coordinates of the normal position vector . The three-dimensional momentum vector is associated with a four-dimensional vector formula_49 on a three-dimensional unit sphere
formula_50
where formula_51 is the unit vector along the new axis. The transformation mapping to can be uniquely inverted; for example, the component of the momentum equals
formula_52
and similarly for and . In other words, the three-dimensional vector is a stereographic projection of the four-dimensional formula_49 vector, scaled by (Figure 8).

Without loss of generality, we may eliminate the normal rotational symmetry by choosing the Cartesian coordinates such that the axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector and the momentum hodographs are aligned as they are in Figure 7, with the centers of the circles on the axis. Since the motion is planar, and and are perpendicular, and attention may be restricted to the three-dimensional vector The family of Apollonian circles of momentum hodographs (Figure 7) correspond to a family of great circles on the three-dimensional formula_49 sphere, all of which intersect the axis at the two foci , corresponding to the momentum hodograph foci at . These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the -axis (Figure 8). This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension . This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.

An elegant action-angle variables solution for the Kepler problem can be obtained by eliminating the redundant four-dimensional coordinates formula_49 in favor of elliptic cylindrical coordinates 
formula_56
where , and are Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions.

== Generalizations to other potentials and relativity ==
The Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector can also be generalized to identify conserved quantities that apply to other situations.

In the presence of a uniform electric field , the generalized Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector formula_1 is
formula_58
where is the charge of the orbiting particle. Although formula_1 is not conserved, it gives rise to a conserved quantity, namely formula_60.

Further generalizing the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector to other potentials and special relativity, the most general form can be written as
formula_61
where and , with the angle defined by
formula_62
and is the Lorentz factor. As before, we may obtain a conserved binormal vector by taking the cross product with the conserved angular momentum vector
formula_63

These two vectors may likewise be combined into a conserved dyadic tensor ,
formula_64

In illustration, the LRL vector for a non-relativistic, isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated. Since the force is central,
formula_65
the angular momentum vector is conserved and the motion lies in a plane.

The conserved dyadic tensor can be written in a simple form
formula_66
although and are not necessarily perpendicular.

The corresponding Runge–Lenz vector is more complicated,
formula_67
where 
formula_68 
is the natural oscillation frequency, and 
formula_69

== Proofs that the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is conserved in Kepler problems ==
The following are arguments showing that the LRL vector is conserved under central forces that obey an inverse-square law.

=== Direct proof of conservation ===
A central force formula_70 acting on the particle is
formula_71
for some function formula_72 of the radius formula_73. Since the angular momentum formula_74 is conserved under central forces, formula_75 and
formula_76
where the momentum formula_77 and where the triple cross product has been simplified using Lagrange&#x27;s formula
formula_78

The identity
formula_79
yields the equation
formula_80

For the special case of an inverse-square central force formula_81, this equals
formula_82

Therefore, is conserved for inverse-square central forces
formula_83

A shorter proof is obtained by using the relation of angular momentum to angular velocity, formula_84, which holds for a particle traveling in a plane perpendicular to formula_85. Specifying to inverse-square central forces, the time derivative of formula_86 is
formula_87
where the last equality holds because a unit vector can only change by rotation, and formula_88 is the orbital velocity of the rotating vector. Thus, is seen to be a difference of two vectors with equal time derivatives.

As described elsewhere in this article, this LRL vector is a special case of a general conserved vector formula_1 that can be defined for all central forces. However, since most central forces do not produce closed orbits (see Bertrand&#x27;s theorem), the analogous vector formula_1 rarely has a simple definition and is generally a multivalued function of the angle between and formula_1.

=== Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates ===
The constancy of the LRL vector can also be derived from the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates , which are defined by the equations
formula_92
where represents the radius in the plane of the orbit
formula_93

The inversion of these coordinates is
formula_94

Separation of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation in these coordinates yields the two equivalent equations

formula_95
where is a constant of motion. Subtraction and re-expression in terms of the Cartesian momenta and shows that is equivalent to the LRL vector
formula_96

=== Noether&#x27;s theorem ===
The connection between the rotational symmetry described above and the conservation of the LRL vector can be made quantitative by way of Noether&#x27;s theorem. This theorem, which is used for finding constants of motion, states that any infinitesimal variation of the generalized coordinates of a physical system
formula_97
that causes the Lagrangian to vary to first order by a total time derivative
formula_98
corresponds to a conserved quantity 
formula_99

In particular, the conserved LRL vector component corresponds to the variation in the coordinates
formula_100
where equals 1, 2 and 3, with and being the -th components of the position and momentum vectors and , respectively; as usual, represents the Kronecker delta. The resulting first-order change in the Lagrangian is
formula_101

Substitution into the general formula for the conserved quantity yields the conserved component of the LRL vector,
formula_102

=== Lie transformation ===
Noether&#x27;s theorem derivation of the conservation of the LRL vector is elegant, but has one drawback: the coordinate variation involves not only the &quot;position&quot; , but also the &quot;momentum&quot; or, equivalently, the &quot;velocity&quot; . This drawback may be eliminated by instead deriving the conservation of using an approach pioneered by Sophus Lie. Specifically, one may define a Lie transformation in which the coordinates and the time are scaled by different powers of a parameter λ (Figure 9),
formula_103

This transformation changes the total angular momentum and energy ,
formula_104
but preserves their product &quot;EL&quot;2. Therefore, the eccentricity and the magnitude are preserved, as may be seen from the equation for
formula_105

The direction of is preserved as well, since the semiaxes are not altered by a global scaling. This transformation also preserves Kepler&#x27;s third law, namely, that the semiaxis and the period form a constant .

== Alternative scalings, symbols and formulations ==
Unlike the momentum and angular momentum vectors and , there is no universally accepted definition of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector; several different scaling factors and symbols are used in the scientific literature. The most common definition is given above, but another common alternative is to divide by the quantity to obtain a dimensionless conserved eccentricity vector
formula_106
where is the velocity vector. This scaled vector has the same direction as and its magnitude equals the eccentricity of the orbit, and thus vanishes for circular orbits.

Other scaled versions are also possible, e.g., by dividing by alone
formula_107
or by 
formula_108
which has the same units as the angular momentum vector .

In rare cases, the sign of the LRL vector may be reversed, i.e., scaled by . Other common symbols for the LRL vector include , , , and . However, the choice of scaling and symbol for the LRL vector do not affect its conservation.

An alternative conserved vector is the binormal vector studied by William Rowan Hamilton,

which is conserved and points along the &quot;minor&quot; semiaxis of the ellipse. (It is not defined for vanishing eccentricity.)

The LRL vector is the cross product of and (Figure 4). On the momentum hodograph in the relevant section above, is readily seen to connect the origin of momenta with the center of the circular hodograph, and to possess magnitude . At perihelion, it points in the direction of the momentum.

The vector is denoted as &quot;binormal&quot; since it is perpendicular to both and . Similar to the LRL vector itself, the binormal vector can be defined with different scalings and symbols.

The two conserved vectors, and can be combined to form a conserved dyadic tensor ,
formula_109
where and are arbitrary scaling constants and formula_110 represents the tensor product (which is not related to the vector cross product, despite their similar symbol). Written in explicit components, this equation reads
formula_111

Being perpendicular to each another, the vectors and can be viewed as the principal axes of the conserved tensor , i.e., its scaled eigenvectors. is perpendicular to ,
formula_112
since and are both perpendicular to as well, .

More directly, this equation reads, in explicit components,
formula_113

<doc id="719464" wikidata="Q5122694" url="?curid=719464" title="Citizens Financial Group">
<text>Citizens Financial Group, Inc. is an American bank holding company, headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company owns the bank Citizens Bank, N.A., which operates in the U.S. states of Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.

Between 1988 and its 2014 initial public offering, Citizens was a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. The group sold its last 20.9% stake in the company in October 2015.

Citizens operates 1,078 branches and 4 wealth centers as of August 31, 2023, and over 3,200 ATMs across 11 states under the Citizens Bank brand.

Citizens ranks 18th on the List of largest banks in the United States as of Q3 2024.

== Early history ==
Citizens was established in 1828 as the High Street Bank in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1871, the Rhode Island legislature gave a second charter to establish the Citizens Savings Bank which eventually acquired its parent group to form Citizens Trust Company. The bank then expanded through Rhode Island, opening a total of 29 branches in that state. It established Citizens Financial Group as a holding company when the bank acquired The Greenville Trust Company in 1954.

In 1985, Citizens changed status from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank. Expansion into other states began with Massachusetts in 1986.

== RBS ownership ==
In 1988, Royal Bank of Scotland Group acquired Citizens. Under RBS ownership, Citizens acquired several smaller banks in New England to become the second largest bank in the region. In 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of First NH Bank, the Bank of Ireland gained a 23.5% stake in Citizens, which RBS then acquired two years later to resume 100% ownership.

In 1999, Citizens acquired the United States Trust Company of Boston and the retail banking business of State Street Corporation, significantly increasing its footprint in Massachusetts.

Expansion outside New England began in 2001, when RBS purchased the retail banking division of Mellon Financial Corporation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware for $2 billion. At one stroke, Citizens Bank became the second-largest bank in Pennsylvania, and a major bank in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
In July 2003, the bank purchased the naming rights to the new home field of the Philadelphia Phillies, which was named Citizens Bank Park.

On January 17, 2003, Citizens Financial Group purchased Commonwealth Bancorp, the holding company for Commonwealth Bank, based in Norristown, Pennsylvania.

In 2004, RBS purchased the credit card division of Connecticut-based People&#x27;s Bank. This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards.

In October 2015, RBS sold its remaining stake in Citizens Financial Group, having progressively reduced its stake through an initial public offering (IPO) started in 2014.

== Charter One Financial ==
In August 2004, Citizens Financial acquired Cleveland-based Charter One Financial, parent company of Charter One Bank, with branches in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, upstate New York, and Vermont for $10.5 billion. Because Citizens Republic Bancorp of Flint, Michigan, already operated under the Citizens Bank name in most of Charter One&#x27;s territory, Citizens Financial elected to keep the Charter One name in Charter One&#x27;s Midwestern footprint. However, it re-branded the New York and Vermont branches as Citizens Bank. This purchase made Citizens Financial the 12th largest bank in the United States with over $131 billion in assets and 1,530 branches across 13 states.

In early 2005, the Charter One name replaced the Citizens Bank banner on seven branches in Butler County, Pennsylvania. This rebranding resolved a 3½-year-old name dispute with Butler-based Citizens National Bank. By mid 2005, Citizens National and Citizens Financial agreed to a compromise. Citizens National Bank changed its name to NexTier Bank, while the Citizens Financial Group branches reverted to the &quot;Citizens Bank&quot; name.

A new corporate logo designed to show Citizens Bank&#x27;s connection to the Royal Bank of Scotland debuted on April 26, 2005.

In July 2006, Citizens Bank eliminated the mortgage department in Michigan and terminated over 100 employees.

On September 1, 2007, the individual banks under Citizens Financial Group, excluding Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, merged into RBS Citizens, N.A.

In November 2008, Charter One sold its network of 65 branches in Indiana to Old National Bank which rebranded them under the Old National Bank banner. The transaction closed in June 2010.

In 2014, Citizens sold 94 branches in metropolitan Chicago to U.S. Bancorp.

Citizens Republic Bancorp was founded in Flint, Michigan, in 1871 and merged with Republic Bank in 2006. In 2007, Citizens Republic prevailed in a case to prevent Citizens Financial from using the similar name in Michigan and Ohio. FirstMerit Bank acquired Citizens Republic in 2013 and rebranded all branches as FirstMerit until 2016 when Huntington Bancshares acquired FirstMerit. With conflicting names no longer an issue, Citizens Bank announced June 30, 2014, that Charter One branches in Michigan and Ohio would be rebranded as Citizens Bank. The name change officially took place on April 27, 2015, bringing to an end the name Charter One in Cleveland; the city in which it was founded.

== Financial crisis ==

In May 2008, Citizens Financial Group failed to publicly announce that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its involvement in the sub-prime mortgage crisis that devastated the U.S. housing market and bond investors around the world. The SEC only investigated banks if suspected of involvement in the purchase and sale of subprime securities.

In 2008, the company lost $929 million and anticipated writing off $2 billion in bad loans. Royal Bank of Scotland posted the biggest loss in British corporate history and announced cost-cutting measures at Citizens.

A Philadelphia developer sued Citizens Bank January 27, 2010, for $8 billion, under a claim that the bank used sham accusations of default to recall loans in an effort to prop up its failing parent companies, Citizens Financial Group and &quot;its ultimate parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.&quot;

== IPO ==

Following the effective nationalization of RBS in 2008, speculation arose as to whether RBS would retain Citizens Bank. In 2012, public pressure in the United Kingdom grew for RBS to focus on its home market and sell foreign assets, including Citizens Bank, in order for UK taxpayers to earn their money back. Substantial interest in Citizens Bank had been rumored from other foreign banks such as Brazil-based Itaú Unibanco and Canada-based Toronto-Dominion Bank, the latter of which already had an existing U.S. branch network that overlapped with the existing Citizen footprint east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Bank of Montreal, with its existing U.S. presence, was also mentioned as a possible buyer. U.S. banks mentioned as potential Citizens buyers included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, and Fifth Third Bank.

In February 2013, RBS confirmed at least a partial spinoff of Citizens through an initial public offering within the next two years. Then in October 2013, RBS announced it would sell its Chicago-area branches, which represented 6% of its U.S. deposits; Citizens later agreed to sell those branches to U.S. Bancorp on January 7, 2014. Finally in November 2013, RBS announced that it would divest all of Citizens Financial Group.

The bank began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CFG on September 24, 2014, raising $3 billion. By April 2015, RBS Group&#x27;s shareholding in the bank had dropped to 45.6%. A further sale in July 2015 reduced RBS&#x27; stake to 23.4%. RBS sold its remaining stake in the bank in October 2015. However, Citizens still uses the RBS &quot;daisy wheel&quot; logo.

In June 2016, it was announced that Citizens Financial Group had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.

== Misappropriation of depositor funds ==

In August 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other federal regulators levied nearly $35 million in penalties against Citizens Bank &quot;for failing to credit to customers’ accounts the full amount of their deposits&quot;. The regulators declared that, from 2008 to 2013, &quot;The bank’s actions resulted in consumers being shorted millions of dollars&quot;. Joint action by the CFPB, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the Currency determined that Citizens Bank had engaged in &quot;deceptive practices&quot; by &quot;fail[ing] to give customers their full deposits at times when the size of the deposit didn’t match the number written on deposit slips&quot;, despite promising to correct such discrepancies, instead pocketing the difference. The bank was required to reimburse its customers for lost funds as well as pay roughly $20 million in fines to the three agencies. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Citizens Bank&#x27;s misconduct &quot;is appalling precisely because it is so basic&quot;, demonstrating that &quot;regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are a necessary defense against a system prone to abuses&quot;.

== Paul Manafort investigation ==

On May 12, 2017, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the United States Department of Justice requested from numerous banks, including Citizens, Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort&#x27;s transaction records. According to the article, the request was related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Manafort reportedly secured a 2.7 million-dollar loan from Citizens in 2016.

On February 26, 2018, Bloomberg News reported that Citizens&#x27; stock price dropped 4.1 percent after U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of Manafort was released, appearing to indicate that Citizens was the &quot;Lender B&quot; cited as having lent 3.4 million dollars to the former campaign manager of President Trump.

== Subsequent acquisitions ==

In August 2018, Citizens completed its acquisition of Franklin American Mortgage in a deal valued at $511 Million, expanding its presence into Tennessee and Texas.

On May 26, 2021, Citizens entered into an agreement with HSBC Bank USA to purchase HSBC&#x27;s retail operations on the East Coast. Under the agreement, Citizens would acquire approximately $9.0 billion in deposits and approximately $2.2 billion in loans.

In April 2022, Citizens completed the acquisition of 80 branches from HSBC in New York City, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia, and Florida.

In July 2021, Citizens announced plans to acquire New Jersey–based bank holding company Investors Bancorp for $3.5 billion. Citizens took over more than 150 branches with the deal. As of February 2023, all Investors locations were rebranded as Citizens Bank.

== Branches ==
Like several other banks, Citizens has agreements with several supermarket chains to locate bank branches in the stores. The greatest number of these are in Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle stores, most of which were acquired in the acquisition of Mellon Financial Corporation&#x27;s retail banking division. Citizens also operates branches inside many Stop &amp; Shop and Shaw&#x27;s stores in New England. One unique aspect at Citizens branches inside supermarkets is full-service banking from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays; historically, USA banks were often closed on Sunday and even Saturdays.

In September 2010, Giant Eagle announced a new agreement with Huntington Bank in which Huntington would open branches in several stores in Ohio and West Virginia and will replace existing branches of other banks when the store&#x27;s agreements with those banks expire.

On June 25, 2008, Citizens Bank announced would sell 18 branches in upstate New York as it prepared to open 57 branches downstate. Community Bank System Inc. of DeWitt, New York purchased the branches in Ausable Forks, Champlain, Fort Covington, Indian Lake, Lake Placid, Lyons Falls, Long Lake, Malone, Newcomb, North Creek, Plattsburgh, Saranac Lake, Ticonderoga, Tupper Lake and Whitehall. The sale completed on November 7, 2008.

In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts promotions for using the bank&#x27;s services.

<doc id="719474" wikidata="Q4596142" url="?curid=719474" title="1st Armoured Division (Australia)">
<text>The 1st Armoured Division was an armoured formation of the Australian Army, raised in 1941 as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during World War II. While the Division was originally to be deployed to North Africa in late 1941, it was retained in Australia following the outbreak of the Pacific War. The 1st Armoured Division formed a key element of Australia&#x27;s defences against a feared Japanese invasion and was disbanded in Western Australia in September 1943.

==History==
===Formation===
The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division was inspired by the success of mass tank tactics in Europe during the early stages of World War II. The Australian War Cabinet approved the formation of an armoured division in July 1940, and 1st Armoured Division was established on 1 July 1941, under the command of Major General John Northcott. The Australian Armoured Corps was established at the same time, with the corps being formally gazetted on 9 July 1941.

The Division was established with two armoured brigades, 1st and 2nd, each of three armoured regiments. These were supported by various corps troops including an armoured car regiment, a motor regiment (converted from a light horse formation), engineers, a field artillery regiment, an anti-tank battery, and a logistics support group. On paper, each armoured regiment was to be equipped with 10 scout cars, 46 cruiser tanks, and six support tanks; while the motor regiment was to be established with 14 scout cars and 44 Universal Carriers, and the armoured car regiment 12 scout cars and 58 armoured cars.

During its early existence, the division faced several key challenges. The formation of an armoured division involved a massive expansion of Australia&#x27;s armoured forces, so the great majority of the division&#x27;s officers and soldiers had to be trained from scratch in newly established armoured warfare schools. This process was greatly complicated by the limited number of tanks available to the division, with the entire division having only eight light and 10 cruiser tanks by December, and having to utilise 30 Universal Carriers for training. While the number of tanks available to the division slowly increased, it did not receive its full allocation until May 1942.

===Defence of Australia===
Prior to the commencement of hostilities with Japan the 1st Armoured Division had been scheduled to deploy to the Middle East where it would be fully equipped and complete its training: the 1st Armoured Brigade was to embark for the Middle East in December 1941, with 2nd Armoured Brigade embarking in March 1942. These plans were, however, dropped in early December 1941 when it was decided to retain the division in Australia to defend against the feared Japanese landings on the Australian mainland. As an emergency measure the division&#x27;s armoured regiments were equipped with Bren Carriers until sufficient tanks arrived.

Major General Horace Robertson replaced Northcott in April 1942 when Northcott was promoted to command the newly established II Corps. The 1st Armoured Division&#x27;s armoured regiments were equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks in April and May 1942. Following this, the division was concentrated in northern New South Wales where it completed its training with a series of large exercises around Narrabri. In January 1943, the division was moved to the area between Perth and Geraldton, Western Australia, where it formed part of III Corps to counter the perceived threat of a Japanese invasion of Western Australia.

===Disbandment===
Due to the end of the Japanese threat to Australia and the unsuitability of large armoured formations in jungle warfare the 1st Armoured Division no longer had any real role by 1943. By this time, there was a manpower shortage in the Australian Army, which required a re-allocation of personnel and the gradual reduction of Australia&#x27;s armoured units. While the division was disbanded in September 1943, its 1st Armoured Brigade and other units was retained as the independent 1st Armoured Brigade Group. This brigade group remained part of III Corps in Western Australia until its disbandment in September 1944. The 4th Armoured Brigade, which was established in March 1943 and included several regiments which had previously formed part of the 1st Armoured Division, provided all the Australian armoured units which saw action from 1943 until the end of the war.

===Former elements in action===
While 1st Armoured Division never saw action as a complete formation, three regiments which were part of the division saw action in the South West Pacific Area, either while assigned to the division, or later. In September 1942, the 2/6th Armoured Regiment, equipped with M3 Stuart light tanks, was deployed to New Guinea, and subsequently saw action during the Battle of Buna–Gona. During 1944–1945, the 2/4th Armoured Regiment contributed squadron-sized elements to both the Bougainville campaign and Aitape–Wewak campaigns, equipped with Matilda tanks. The 2/9th Armoured Regiment, also using Matildas, served in the Borneo campaign, including the Australian amphibious landings at Tarakan, Sarawak, Brunei, Labuan and British Borneo in 1945. Other armoured units, such as the 1st Armoured Regiment, which also took part in the Borneo campaign, were Militia units which had not formed part of the 1st Armoured Division.

<doc id="719475" wikidata="Q791632" url="?curid=719475" title="Beach Boys' Party!">
<text>Beach Boys&#x27; Party! is the tenth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, and their third in 1965, consisting mostly of cover songs played with acoustic instruments. It reached No. 6 in the US and No. 3 in the UK. The album spawned one single, a cover of the Regents&#x27; &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;, which reached No. 2 in the US and No. 3 in the UK, and was their highest-charting British single to that point.

&quot;Party!&quot; was recorded in a music studio and presented as an impromptu live recording of a party, with informal chatter by friends and family overdubbed later. The record company, Capitol, wanted an album for the holiday season, but as there was no new material ready, several options were considered, including a greatest hits album and a live album, before the band decided on the party theme. The Beach Boys covered songs by the Beatles, several doo-wop groups, Bob Dylan, and the Everly Brothers, as well as two of their own earlier hits performed in a tongue-in-cheek style. While the &quot;beach party&quot; atmospherics fit into the Beach Boys style to that point, the varied musical influences presaged the change of direction that would occur over the next several years beginning with &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966).

Because of its stripped-down approach, &quot;Party!&quot; is considered to be the first &quot;unplugged&quot; type album. In 2015, Capitol issued &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party! Uncovered and Unplugged&quot;, an 81-track expansion and remix of the album.

==Background and recording==
In August, after the release of &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot;, the Beach Boys&#x27; leader Brian Wilson was contemplating his next studio effort, which would turn out to be &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Capitol Records requested a new album for the holiday season. Since &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot; had been released the previous year, as had a live performance via &quot;Beach Boys Concert&quot;, the &quot;live party&quot; idea was selected to reflect the togetherness of the holiday spirit. Sporadically during September, the band and their friends rehearsed current and older hits (including revisiting the Rivingtons&#x27; &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;). Although presented as an impromptu live recording of a continuous set of songs played at a small party, the songs were recorded and mixed individually in a sound studio as any regular studio album, and laughter and background chatter was mixed in during post-production.

The album included versions of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;; &quot;Devoted to You&quot; by the Everly Brothers; the Phil Spector produced &quot;There&#x27;s No Other (Like My Baby)&quot; and a send-up of their own &quot;I Get Around&quot; and &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;. David Leaf noted: &quot;In an era when rock stars were beginning to take themselves more seriously, the Beach Boys showed how natural it was to make fun of themselves.&quot;

Author Geoffrey Himes wrote that the party theme was created to justify the casual arrangements. Music theorist Daniel Harrison wrote: &quot;&quot;Party&quot; was an exercise in minimalistic production. ... The performances seem unrehearsed, the instrumental support is minimal (acoustical [sic] guitar, bongo drums, tambourine), and fooling around (laughing, affected singing, background conversation) pervades every track.&quot; It was Wilson&#x27;s first exploration in &quot;party tracks&quot;, a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises as if at a party. He would continue this approach with &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; in 1967.

Several other songs were also recorded, but not put on the album. This included renditions of the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Ruby Baby&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and the Robins&#x27; &quot;Riot In Cell Block #9&quot;.

==Promotion==
The original release of &quot;Party!&quot; included a sheet of photographs which depicted the band at a party. In order to promote the album, Capitol distributed to dealers a million bags of potato chips which bore the album&#x27;s cover art, intended to be given away to record buyers for free. The label also coordinated a motion floor merchandiser containing five Beach Boys LPs, full-color streamers for window displays, and full-scale radio and newspaper advertising.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard&quot; evaluated that &quot;Party!&quot; would have strong sales potential: &quot;The boys have a ball performing in this intimate, ad-lib program of hot material. ... [an] exciting, discotheque package.&quot;

In November 1965, the Beach Boys released the non-album single &quot;The Little Girl I Once Knew&quot; which repeatedly used a measure of silence in the arrangement and was reportedly disliked by radio programmers owing to their avoidance of having &quot;dead air&quot;; this has been cited as being partially responsible for the single stalling at US number 20. Still wanting to play new material by the band, radio disc jockeys around the United States began playing the last track of &quot;Party!&quot; straight off the LP, a cover of The Regents&#x27; &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;. It received good listener response and was issued as a single by Capitol when they started hearing from radio programmers; it became a number 2 hit in early 1966.

===Retrospective reviews===
Richie Unterberger wrote: &quot;In recent years, this album has gone up a few notches in critical esteem, praised for its loose, casual feel and insight into the group&#x27;s influences. Realistically, though, its present-day appeal lies mostly with dedicated fans of the group, as fun and engaging as it is. Others will find the material shopworn in places, and the presentation too corny.&quot; Writer Jim Fusilli said: &quot;This &quot;Beach Boys Party!&quot; really blows. ... They mock &#x27;I Get Around&#x27; and &#x27;Little Deuce Coupe.&#x27; Imagine doing that—mocking your own work, music some people cherish.&quot; Mitchell Cohen of the publication &quot;Best Classic Bands&quot; wrote that &quot;Party!&quot; is more reminiscent of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions than the first &quot;unplugged&quot; album, observing: &quot;Brian is there, but he doesn&#x27;t do very much, ... [His production] credit seems almost insulting, because for the most part it&#x27;s Mike&#x27;s show, even more so on the naked sessions ... Carl and Dennis grab on to the Beatles tunes like a life raft, and Brian is in the corner. This isn&#x27;t his party, but he&#x27;ll have to clean up when it&#x27;s over.&quot;

== Alternate releases ==

In 1990, &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot; was paired on CD with &quot;Stack-o-Tracks&quot;, a 1968 album of instrumental mixes of Beach Boys tracks. The bonus tracks for this CD were instrumental mixes of &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot;, &quot;California Girls&quot;, and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;. The &quot;Party! / Stack-o-Tracks&quot; CD was reissued in 2001. In 2012, the first stereo mix of &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot; was released.

On November 20, 2015, Capitol issued an 81-track expanded remix, &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party! Uncovered and Unplugged&quot;, containing the original album without overdubs followed by a selection of outtakes culled from the album&#x27;s original five recording sessions.

<text>Davitt Moroney (born 23 December 1950) is a British-born and educated musicologist, harpsichordist and organist. His parents were of Irish and Italian extraction – his father was an executive with the Anglo-Dutch Unilever conglomerate. From 1968 onward, he undertook his undergraduate and graduate studies in musicology at King&#x27;s College London, the faculty of which was headed by Thurston Dart, a great influence on the world of early music. Moroney later pursued advanced harpsichord studies with Kenneth Gilbert and Gustav Leonhardt. Moroney also holds performance and teaching diplomas (1974) from the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. After earning his PhD in musicology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980 with a thesis on the music of Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, he returned to Paris and worked mainly as a freelance performer until returning to the United States to serve on the faculty at UC Berkeley in 2001.

He has given the first modern performances of much repertoire; the &quot;Livre de tablature de Clavescin&quot; by Marc Roger Normand Couperin of Turin, whose works he identified in 1997, the complete organ works of Louis Couperin and a newly discovered autograph manuscript of harpsichord music by Henry Purcell.

He has recorded Bach, Biber, Couperin, and others. He won the 2000 Gramophone Early Music award for his recording of the complete keyboard music of William Byrd (see also: &quot;My Ladye Nevells Booke&quot; and &quot;The Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;), published on Hyperion Records, which he performed on harpsichord, chamber organ, church organ, clavichord, and muselar.

He has published critical editions of the work of various baroque composers, including a keyboard edition (and his own recording) of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; that contains his own completion of the final unfinished fugue. He has also rediscovered the 40 and 60 part mass &quot;Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno&quot; by Alessandro Striggio, lost since the 17th century, of which he conducted what he believed to be the first performance since the 16th century on 17 July 2007 at the BBC Proms in London.

Until 2001, he was also director of Éditions de l&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre, the French-Australian music publishing company which sold its LP business to Decca Classics in 1970.

<text>The University of New Orleans (UNO) is a public research university in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. First opened in 1958 as Louisiana State University in New Orleans, it is the largest public university and one of two doctoral research universities in the Greater New Orleans region. UNO is a member of the University of Louisiana System and is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university consists of eight schools and colleges offering 40 bachelor&#x27;s, 45 master&#x27;s and 17 doctoral degree programs. Among its academic offerings are the only civil, mechanical and electrical engineering programs in New Orleans, the only graduate hospitality and tourism program and PAB-accredited urban planning program in the state of Louisiana, and one of the few schools of naval architecture and marine engineering in the United States.

UNO&#x27;s 195-acre main campus is located on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain in Gentilly, New Orleans. The university&#x27;s East Campus houses athletic facilities including Maestri Field and the UNO Lakefront Arena. UNO also owns and operates The Beach, a research and technology park adjacent to its main campus.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are the Privateers. A total of 14 Privateer teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southland Conference.

==History==
State Senator Theodore M. Hickey of New Orleans in 1956 authored the act which established the University of New Orleans. At the time New Orleans was the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a public university though it had several private universities, such as Tulane (which was originally a state-supported university before being privatized in 1884), Loyola, and Dillard. The institution was a branch of Louisiana State University, and as such was originally named Louisiana State University in New Orleans or LSUNO. The UNO University Ballroom was named in Hickey&#x27;s honor late in 2014, more than two decades after his death.

The university was built on the New Orleans Lakefront when the United States Navy relocated Naval Air Station New Orleans. The Orleans Levee Board leased the closed base to the LSU Board of Supervisors. The renovation went quicker than expected. LSUNO opened for classes in 1958, two years ahead of schedule. It was the first racially integrated public university in the South. For its first five years, it was reckoned as an offsite department of the main campus in Baton Rouge, and as such its chief administrative officer was originally called a dean (1958–1961), then a vice president in charge (1961–1962). In 1962, the LSU System of Higher Education was established, and LSUNO became a separate campus in that system. To signify that it was now a co-equal institution with LSU, its chief executive&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;vice president in charge&quot; to &quot;chancellor.&quot; After a decade of growth, the LSU Board of Supervisors approved a name change to the current &quot;University of New Orleans.&quot; Nearly fifty years later, in 2011, the University of New Orleans was transferred from LSU to the University of Louisiana system, and its chief executive&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;president.&quot;

===Hurricane Katrina===
On August 29, 2005, the university suffered damage due to Hurricane Katrina. The main campus is on relatively high ground, so the damage was caused mostly by winds, rain-driven-water, and human activity during the storm. The university was used as an evacuation point and staging area by the National Guard. A levee breach on the London Avenue Canal occurred just a few blocks south of the main campus and caused the flooding of the first floor of the Bienville Hall dormitories, the Lafitte Village couples apartments, and the Engineering Building.

UNO was the first of the large, damaged universities in New Orleans to re-open, albeit virtually, by using web-based courses starting in October 2005. The university was able to offer classes in the fall semester immediately following Hurricane Katrina at satellite campuses; the main campus re-opened in December 2005.

Hurricane Katrina reduced enrollments at all colleges in New Orleans, but the University of New Orleans was particularly hard hit. This echoed the damage to New Orleans as a whole, since UNO serves as a leader in educating students from New Orleans. Since the hurricane, the student enrollment is on a steady increase toward pre-Katrina numbers.

===Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic===
While the COVID-19 pandemic caused a drop in enrollment at universities across the United States, the University of New Orleans was particularly hard hit for a variety of reasons. Partially due to a large portion of UNO&#x27;s non-traditional student base seeking education at non-traditional online universities, a failure to truly have in-person classes for traditional students in the years following COVID, and subsequent hurricanes the years following, UNO&#x27;s enrollment hit record lows, close to its post-Katrina numbers. Because of this, less than a year after her appointment to the position, President Kathy Johnson laid off numerous employees and shrunk budgets by over 15% during the summer of 2024. The following year, university administrators announced a $10 million budget deficit and began mandatory furloughs for university employees.

There are more than 120 registered clubs and organizations active at UNO, including roughly 15 fraternities and sororities. UNO Student Government is the official student government association. Registered organizations are separated into categories of either religious, honorary, political, professional, social, service, organizations, or special interests.

===Media===
&quot;The Driftwood&quot; was the UNO weekly newspaper and was published every Thursday. UNO also owns and operates WWNO, a local radio station. WWNO began transmitting in 1972.

===Greek life===
The Greek community at the University of New Orleans is composed of about 15 fraternities and sororities.

==Colleges==

UNO has four colleges: College of Business Administration, College of Liberal Arts, Education and Human Development, College of Engineering, and College of Sciences. The university also offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies.

==Campus==
The university&#x27;s campus is located in the New Orleans metropolitan area, sitting on Lake Pontchartrain at the end of Elysian Fields Avenue and on the former site of NAS New Orleans. The UNO Research and Technology Park, referred to as &quot;The Beach&quot; is located adjacent to campus on the former site of the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park. The Kiefer UNO Lakefront Arena and Maestri Field at Privateer Park, UNO&#x27;s basketball and baseball facilities, are located at the corner of Franklin Avenue and Leon C. Simon Boulevard.

UNO&#x27;s classes were originally housed in the remaining buildings following the closure of NAS New Orleans at that site. As a nod to campus&#x27; time as a Naval base, the oldest lecture buildings completed in 1960, the Liberal Arts Building and the Science Building, are both numbered and laid-out like a ship with Liberal Arts featuring exterior balconies for access to the classrooms as opposed to interior hallways, and both Liberal Arts and Science featuring two central courtyards in each building.

Throughout the years, additional permanent buildings were built to accommodate a larger student body. These include Milneburg Hall (1969), the University Center (1969), the Earl K. Long Library (1970), the Geology/Psychology Building (1972), the Engineering Building (1987), the Life Sciences Complex (Phase 1: the Computer Center, Phase 2: the Biology Building, and Phase 3: the Mathematics Building; All completed between 1979 and 1984), the Chemical-Sciences Annex (1997), and Kirschman Hall (2004).

The College of Engineering building is the tallest building on campus. It has nine floors and is home to the university&#x27;s Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (NAME) Program, among other engineering programs.

Two buildings on campus feature atrium designs as opposed to hallways. Kirschman Hall, the newest lecture building on campus and home of the College of Business Administration, features a large atrium in the center with a few satellite hallways connecting to it. It is considered to be the second largest lecture building on campus (after the engineering building).

=== Campus life centers ===
The University of New Orleans features three buildings that are considered to be the centers of campus life:

==== Earl K. Long Library ====

The Earl K. Long Library is home to the Privateer Enrollment Center, which is &quot;a one-stop shop for all your enrollment needs.&quot; This location includes offices of Enrollment, Orientation, the Bursar, Financial Aid, and Academic Advising. Not only is this building home to many enrollment services, but this building also has a Coffee Shop run by dining services and different academic resources on each floor. The first floor is home to a large study area known as the &quot;Learning Commons&quot; which is home to a large computer lab in the front, an open-concept study area in the rear, the offices of Student Accountability/Disability Services &amp; the Learning Resource Center, and group study room. The second floor is home to quiet computers, additional group study rooms, periodicals, the Women&#x27;s Center, and the UNO Press. The third floor houses the silent study room, the honors program, the innovation suite, the meditation area, and private study rooms for faculty and graduate students. The fourth floor is where the quiet study area, the special collections/archives, the reading room, various conferences rooms, and additional offices are located.

==== University Center ====
The university center is &quot;the center of campus life at UNO.&quot; The building is home to dining services locations, the grand ball room, the Captain&#x27;s Quarter&#x27;s Game Room, the UNO Bookstore, and various meeting spaces. University offices located here include counseling services, career services, student involvement and leadership, Greek life, student government association, student affairs, the HUB, the student pantry, student transitions, and the Juan LaFonta Diversity Engagement Center. It is also home to an Oschner Health Clinic and various leisure spaces. The lobby of the building features a large atrium with flags hanging down. These are placed the first time a student comes to the university from another nation.

==== Administration Building ====
The Administration Building consists of two sections: the original administration building and the newer administration annex, an addition to the building that was built later. Many university administrative offices are located here though these are typically administrative and not often visited by students. However, it is important to note that the main office for the graduate school is located here and not in the Library.

=== Residential life ===

The university&#x27;s campus is home to three on-campus housing options for students all located on UNO&#x27;s main campus:

*Pontchartrain Halls
*Privateer Place
*Lafitte Village

Prior to the construction of the two Pontchartrain Halls following Hurricane Katrina, students lived at a dormitory known as Bienville Hall. After being used as office space while campus was being reconfigured after Katrina, the main residential section of the building finally closed down in 2010. The disused building was demolished in 2023 and the Hynes-UNO Charter School was built on the site.

The rear Commons of the building was not included in the deconstruction. Once the cafeteria and amenities for on campus housing, it is now home to the Facility Services Workshop, and some storage for the Engineering Building.

=== Dining services ===
The university&#x27;s dining services are currently managed by Chartwells Higher Ed, a branch of Compass Group. They manage all dining locations on campus including the university&#x27;s buffet-styled cafeteria is known as the Food Hall at the Galley. Retail dining locations are mainly located on the Deck (which is in the university center on the east side of campus) and the Cove (which is a building located on the west side of campus). Retail franchises include Subway, Chick Fil A, Fujisan Sushi, Bowl Life, and Brewed Awakening (which brews Starbucks Coffee). Moe&#x27;s Southwest Grill and the Sandbar at the Cove are under temporary closure due to low student enrollment. Additionally, Chartwells manages three convenience &quot;Markets&quot; on campus known as the Market NOLA (which is located in the university center and serves PJ&#x27;s coffee), Market Cove (located in the cove), and Market Pontchartrain (located in the residence hall on campus).

==Athletics==

The University of New Orleans currently has 14 varsity sports teams, and is a Division I member of the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association), competing in the Southland Conference. UNO originally attempted to reclassify to Division II&#x27;s Gulf South Conference. On February 1, 2011, Provost Joe King submitted the Division II proposal to the LSU Board of Supervisors. Previously, UNO competed at the Division II level from 1969 to 1975. On March 9, 2012, President Peter J. Fos announced that UNO plans to remain a member of NCAA Division I, with potential homes being the Sun Belt or Southland Conference. On August 21, 2012, UNO announced that it would be joining the Southland Conference, effective the 2013–2014 academic year.

In November 2022, students overwhelmingly voted against a fee increase to add football, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s golf, and marching band to the campus.

===Sports===
*Baseball
*Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball
*Men&#x27;s golf
*Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country
*Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis
*Volleyball
*Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field
*Women&#x27;s sand volleyball

===Fight song===
The official fight song of the University of New Orleans is &quot;Let&#x27;s Hear It For UNO&quot;. The song was adopted after a competition in 1981. The winner was Lois Ostrolenk. Before this, the melody from William Tell Overture was used. A variation of the overture is still played to honor this tradition.

===Club sports===
The University of New Orleans has many club sports provided by the Department of Recreation and Intramural Sports. Club sports are available to all UNO students who have an interest. Active club sports include:

==The Beach (Research and Technology Park)==

<doc id="719486" wikidata="Q442195" url="?curid=719486" title="Dennis Chávez">
<text>Dionisio &quot;Dennis&quot; Chávez (April 8, 1888November 18, 1962) was an American politician who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1931 to 1935, and in the United States Senate from 1935 to 1962. He was the first Hispanic person to be elected to a full term in the US Senate and the first US Senator to be born in New Mexico, which was still a US territory at the time of his birth. In 1920, he became the first Latino lawyer in the United States. 

==Early life ==
Chávez was born in Los Chavez in the New Mexico Territory. His parents, David and Paz Chávez, were members of families that had lived in Los Chavez for generations. There was no school in that town. In 1895, David Chávez moved his family to the Barelas section of Albuquerque, New Mexico to work on the railroad and Dennis attended school until 7th grade when financial hardships necessitated that he work. His first job was delivering groceries at the Highland Grocery store. Later on, he studied engineering and surveying at night, and worked as an engineer for the City of Albuquerque for several years. Dennis&#x27;s younger brother, David Chávez, served as the 34th Mayor of Santa Fe, a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, and as a member of the New Mexico Supreme Court.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Chávez worked briefly as editor of a Belen weekly newspaper, as a court interpreter, and as a private contractor until 1916, when he obtained temporary employment as a Spanish interpreter for Senator Andrieus A. Jones&#x27; election campaign. In 1917, he was offered a position as assistant executive clerk of the Senate in Washington, D.C., by Senator Jones. He accepted this position, passed a special admission exam at Georgetown University Law Center and studied law at night. He graduated from Georgetown in 1920, and returned to Albuquerque to establish a law practice. He was successful in defending organized labor and as a defense counsel in high-profile murder cases, where he used his popularity to run for office.

=== House ===
In 1922, Chávez was elected to the New Mexico state legislature, but he did not seek another term. In 1930, he was elected to New Mexico&#x27;s one at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat, and was re-elected in 1932. Chávez served as chairman of the House Committee on Irrigation and Reclamation. He did not seek re-election to the House in 1934, becoming a candidate for the United States Senate.

=== Senate ===
Chávez was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senator from New Mexico in 1934. He lost narrowly to Republican incumbent Bronson M. Cutting. However, Cutting was killed in an airplane crash on May 6, 1935, and five days later, Chávez was appointed to fill the vacancy pending a special election. In 1936, Chávez was elected to the remaining four years of Cutting&#x27;s term, and then won a full term of his own in 1940, becoming the first person of Hispanic descent to be elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. (Octaviano Larrazolo, also from New Mexico, was the first Hispanic to be elected to the Senate, but he was only elected to the remainder of an unexpired term and never served a full term.) Chávez was re-elected again in 1946, 1952 and 1958, and served until his death in 1962. He served as chairman of the Committee on Public Works from 1949 to 1953, and again from 1955 until his death.

In 1954, Senate Republicans attempted to remove Chávez from his seat, claiming that irregularities from the 1952 election meant the election results could not be trusted. A resolution that claimed no candidate had won the 1952 election, and therefore requiring the Republican governor of New Mexico to appoint a new senator, was defeated by a vote of 36-53.

== Personal life ==

In 1911, Chávez married Imelda Espinosa, a member of a prominent New Mexico family. In 1914, they moved to Belen. The couple had three children: Dennis, Jr., Gloria and Ymelda.

Dennis Chávez died of cancer, attributed to his being a lifelong smoker, in Washington, D.C., on November 18, 1962, and was buried at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Congress honored his memory with a minute of silence, and then-Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke at his funeral. At the time of his death, he was fourth-ranking in Senate seniority.

==Legacy==

Chávez, only the second-ever Hispanic member of the US Senate, was the first US-born Hispanic elected to the Senate (Octaviano Larrazolo was born in Mexico). He was also the first person born in New Mexico elected by the state to the Senate. By a large margin, he is the longest-serving Hispanic US senator.

He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 35¢ Great Americans series (1980–2000) postage stamp.

His daughter, Ymelda Chavez Dixon, wrote a successful women&#x27;s column for the Washington Evening Star from 1965 to 1981 called &quot;Your Date with Ymelda.&quot;

A granddaughter, Gloria Tristani, followed in public service, serving as chair of the New Mexico State Corporations Commission in 1996, as a member of the Federal Communications Commission from 1997 to 2001, and as the Democratic nominee for New Mexico&#x27;s other U.S. Senate seat in 2002 where she lost to Senator Pete Domenici.

<text>Bloomsbury Publishing plc is a British worldwide publishing house of fiction and non-fiction. Bloomsbury&#x27;s head office is located on Bedford Square in Bloomsbury, an area of the London Borough of Camden. It has a US publishing office located in New York City, an India publishing office in New Delhi, an Australian sales office in Sydney CBD, and other publishing offices in the UK, including in Oxford. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
The company was founded in 1986 by Nigel Newton, who had previously been employed by other publishing companies. It was floated as a public registered company in 1994, raising £5.5 million, which was used to fund expansion of the company into paperback and children&#x27;s books. A rights issue of shares in 1998 further raised £6.1 million, which was used to expand the company, in particular to found a U.S. branch. In 1998, Bloomsbury USA was established. Bloomsbury USA Books for Young Readers was established in 2002, and in 2005, Bloomsbury acquired Walker &amp; Co, a small company dedicated to publishing nonfiction. The Walker brand was discontinued in 2015 and sold to Walker Publishing Company.

In December 2008, Bloomsbury opened a branch in Doha, Qatar in a joint-partnership with Qatar Foundation. The partnership created a publishing house, Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing; it worked mainly with English and Arabic literature.

Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals (BQFJ), an open access and peer reviewed academic publisher, was created in December 2010 as a joint venture with Qatar Foundation. Journal research articles were published through BQFJ&#x27;s website &quot;QScience.com&quot;. The company&#x27;s partnership with Qatar Foundation ended in December 2015 and all of Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing works were incorporated in Qatari-owned HBKU Press. At the time of BQFP&#x27;s dissolution it had published over 200 books. BQFJ&#x27;s works were also incorporated in HBKU Press.

In 2012, Bloomsbury established a publishing office in India. In May 2023, an article in &quot;The Verge&quot; reported that the cover of the UK edition of &quot;House of Earth and Blood&quot;, published by Bloomsbury, uses an AI-generated image.

In 2018, an article disclosed that much of the profit in the children&#x27;s division was due to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series by J. K. Rowling.

<text>The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is a diocese of the Episcopal Church covering Washington, D.C., and nearby counties of Maryland in the United States. With a membership of over 38,000, the diocese is led by the bishop of Washington, Mariann Budde. It is home to Washington National Cathedral, which is the seat of both the diocesan bishop and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.

==History==
Since its creation in 1895 from the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland, the territory has included the District of Columbia, adjacent suburban Maryland counties of Prince George&#x27;s and Montgomery, and the southern Maryland counties of Charles County and St. Mary&#x27;s County.

The land now known as the District of Columbia once comprised parts of Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County in Maryland. A congregation which later became known as Rock Creek parish was founded in 1712, and by seven years later had built a chapel of ease for (Broad Creek Parish), which was the spiritual counterpart to secular government in Prince George&#x27;s County. The congregation built a larger, Georgian style building in 1775, which is now known as St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Rock Creek Parish (Washington, D.C.). It is the oldest religious institution within the District of Columbia. The former glebe (farm to support the parish priest) became the non-denominational Rock Creek Cemetery, now also home to the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington.

As European settlement moved westward and the area&#x27;s population increased, additional congregations began and built chapels within what Maryland&#x27;s General Assembly in 1776 designated Montgomery County. These congregations had split off from Broad or Rock Creek parish and became Prince George&#x27;s Parish in 1726 (later Christ Episcopal Church (Rockville, Maryland)) and Eden or Sugarland Parish in 1737 (which later became St. Peter&#x27;s Church (Poolesville, Maryland)), only to be reassigned to the newly formed diocese of Washington over a century later.

After the American Revolutionary War, both Maryland and Virginia donated land to form the new federal District of Columbia. Additional congregations which ultimately became parishes formed much nearer the Potomac River at this time, including Christ Church, Washington Parish (a/k/a Navy Yard; 1794), Christ Church (Georgetown, Washington, D.C.), and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Georgetown (1796). After the destruction of the War of 1812, with the Burning of Washington in August 1814, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square (1815) was built facing historic Lafayette Square across from the rebuilt &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot;, at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., (in the historic Lafayette Square Historic District) which later became known as the &quot;Executive Mansion&quot; and later the White House. St. John&#x27;s has been long known as the &quot;Church of the Presidents&quot;, visited frequently by neighboring chief executives and is the traditional site for an early morning prayer service and mass during inauguration days on March 4 and later January 20. Another historic episcopal church formed in the capital city, and which hosted nearby Maryland diocesan conventions, is the Church of the Epiphany (Washington, D.C.). Parishes formed during the 19th Century&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Movement&quot; included St. Paul&#x27;s Church on K Street, and St. James&#x27; Church on Capitol Hill. At least six historic African-American parishes formed in the capital city during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

Construction of the Gothic Revival &quot;Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and the Diocese of Washington&quot; (usually known as the Washington National Cathedral) on Mount Saint Albans at the intersection of Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues in northwest Washington began with a charter issued by the United States Congress in 1893 and on September 29, 1907, the cornerstone was laid in the presence of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt and a crowd of 20,000 and continued with fits and starts until its general completion in the early 1990s, with a ceremony attended by 41st President, George H. W. Bush, serving as a &quot;national house of prayer for all people&quot; and becoming a national landmark for the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.A. and icon for the Anglican Communion in the world.

==Bishops==
The first African-American bishop for the Diocese was elected and ordained with John Thomas Walker as the sixth prelate in 1977 who served until his death 12 years later. After the eighth bishop of Washington, John Bryson Chane, announced his intention to retire in the fall of 2011, a diocesan convention on June 18, 2011, elected Mariann Edgar Budde as its first female diocesan bishop. She was ordained and consecrated on November 12, 2011.

<doc id="719496" wikidata="Q1415022" url="?curid=719496" title="Scagliola">
<text>Scagliola (from the Italian &quot;scaglia&quot;, meaning &quot;chips&quot;) is a type of fine plaster used in architecture and sculpture. The same term identifies the technique for producing columns, sculptures, and other architectural elements that resemble inlays in marble. The scagliola technique came into fashion in 17th-century Tuscany as an effective substitute for costly marble inlays, the pietra dura works created for the Medici family in Florence. The use of scagliola declined in the 20th century.

Scagliola is a composite substance made from plaster of Paris, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. The material may be veined with colors and applied to a core, or desired pattern may be carved into a previously prepared scagliola matrix. The pattern&#x27;s indentations are then filled with the colored, plaster-like scagliola composite, and then polished with flax oil for brightness, and wax for protection. The combination of materials and technique provides a complex texture, and richness of color not available in natural veined marbles.

A comparable material is terrazzo. Marmorino is a synonym, but scagliola and terrazzo should not be confused with plaster of Paris, which is one ingredient.

== Method ==

Batches of pigmented plaster, modified with animal glue are applied to molds, armatures and pre-plastered wall planes in a manner that accurately mimics natural stone, breccia and marble. In one technique, veining is created by drawing strands of raw silk saturated in pigment through the plaster mix. Another technique involves trowelling on several layers of translucent renders and randomly cutting back to a previous layer to achieve colour differential similar to jasper. 

When dry, the damp surface was pumiced smooth, then buffed with a linen cloth impregnated with Tripoli (a siliceous rottenstone) and charcoal; finally it was buffed with oiled felt; beeswax was sometimes used for this purpose. Because the colours are integral to the plaster, the pattern is more resistant to scratching than with other techniques, such as painting on wood.

There are two scagliola techniques: in traditional &#x27;Bavarian scagliola&#x27; coloured batches of plaster of Paris are worked to a stiff, dough-like consistency. The plaster is modified with the addition of animal glues such as isinglass or hide glue. &#x27;Marezzo scagliola&#x27; is worked with the pigmented batches of plaster in a liquid state and relies mainly on the use of Keene&#x27;s cement, a unique gypsum plaster product in which plaster of Paris was steeped in alum or borate, then burned in a kiln and ground to a fine powder; invented around 1840, it sets to an exceptionally hard state. 

It is typically used without the addition of animal glues. Marezzo scagliola is often called American scagliola because of its widespread use in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Slabs of Marezzo scagliola may be used as table tops. When set, scagliola is hard enough to be turned on a lathe to form vases, balusters and finials.

== History ==

While there is evidence of scagliola decoration in ancient Roman architecture, scagliola decoration became popular in Italian Baroque buildings in the 17th century, and was imitated throughout Europe until the 19th century. Superb altar frontals using this technique are to be found at the Certosa di Padula in the Campania, Southern Italy.

An early use of scagliola in England is in a fireplace at Ham House, Surrey, which was brought from Italy along with the window sill in the reign of Charles II. This employs the use of a scagliola background which was then cut into to lay in the design.

In 1761, a scagliolista, Domenico Bartoli, from Livorno arrived in London and was employed by William Constable of Burton Constable in Yorkshire. Here he produced two chimneypieces in white marble inlaid with the scagliola embellishments directly into cut matrices in the marble. Apart from the protective edges of altars at Padula this seems to be the first use of this technique. 

In 1766 he went into partnership with Johannes Richter, possibly from Dresden, who may have brought a young Pietro Bossi with him. The name Bossi is associated with a family of Northern Italian scagliolisti. Bartoli supplied table tops to Ireland and one chimneypiece at Belvedere House in Dublin could be attributed to Richter. Their styles are very different. There is little evidence that either of them came to Ireland. 

Pietro Bossi arrived in Dublin in 1784 and probably died there in 1798. He produced a number of chimneypieces in Dublin of very good quality. Scagliola inlay proved to be desirable in Ireland and there appears to be a continuation long after it became unfashionable in England. 

In 1911, Herbert Cescinsky, in &quot;English Furniture&quot; remarked that scagliola had been popular in Dublin fifty years before. This would explain one at 86, Stephen&#x27;s Green, clearly an 18th. Century chimneypiece, which has been later embellished in the mid 19th. Century for Crofton Vanderleur, formerly at 4, Parnell Square. A later firm, Sharpe &amp; Emery, Pearce St., Dublin produce a number of examples in the neo-classical Bossi style, sometimes using original chimneypieces.

The correspondence between British Resident in Florence Sir Horace Mann and Horace Walpole describes the process of obtaining a prized scagliola table top. Having received his first top from the Irishman Friar Ferdinando Henrico Hugford (1695–1771) around 1740 Walpole had asked his friend Mann to acquire some more... 
(one of these tables is at The Vyne. That table has the arms of Walpole (with his post 1726 Garter Knight embellishments) impaling Shorter - for Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole and his first wife Catherine Shorter, who died 20 August 1737. He married Maria Skerret in early 1738, thus The Vyne&#x27;s table could seem have been ordered before c1736-37).

In a letter dated 26 November 1741 Mann writes to Walpole:

Your scagliola table was near finished when behold the stone on which the stuff is put, opened of itself so that all that was done, to his [Hugford&#x27;s] great mortification is spoilt. He would have been off for beginning again on account of his eyes etc., but I have begged he will do it and he is about it

and on 15 July 1742:

Your scagliola table is almost finished (you remember the first he [Hugford] undertook broke when near done) and is very handsome, but even in this commission my success is not complete, for I cannot persuade the padre [Hugford] to make its companion

and on 30 October 1742:

Your scagliola table is finished, though I have not got it home. The nasty priest [Hugford] will have 25 zecchins [£12 10s] besides many thanks, for the preference given to me, for some simple English have been tampering with him and offered 30 to get it, though it is by no means such a fine performance. The priest wishes I would not take it, as he would make a present of it to the Pope. He leaves Florence for good

and on 11 July 1747:

You bid me get you two scagliola tables, but don&#x27;t mention the size or any other particulars. The man who made yours is no longer in Florence. Here is a scholar of his [Don Pietro Belloni?], but vastly inferior to him, and so slow in working that he has been almost three years about a pair for a Mr Leson [Joseph Leeson], and requires still six months more. I will endeavour to get somebody to write to the first friar [Hugford] and to engage him to make two tables in his convent and send them to Florence, of which I hope to be able to give you an account by next post.

and on 10 October 1749:

I am glad your scagliola tables please. You must make the greater account of them, as it is impossible to get any more of the same man [Hugford], nor indeed of his disciple here [Belloni], who is a priest too, and has been four years about a pair I bespoke of him, which he tells me plainly he cannot finish in less than two more. They work for diversion and won&#x27;t be hurried.

In modern times—Tusmore House, Oxfordshire:

The great triumph of the saloon, however, is the use of scagliola, including the richly coloured and figured Sienna shafts of the eight fluted Corinthian columns...and the urns, entablature and balustrade to the second-floor landing which gives access to four plaster-vaulted ante rooms serving the main bedrooms. All this scagliola was produced by Richard Feroze, England&#x27;s leading contemporary scagliola-maker. 
Italian plasterworkers produced scagliola columns and pilasters for Robert Adam at Syon House (notably the columns in the Anteroom) and at Kedleston Hall (notably the pilasters in the Saloon). In 1816 the Coade Ornamental Stone Manufactory extended their practice to include scagliola; their scagliola was used by Benjamin Dean Wyatt at Apsley House, London.

In the United States scagliola was popular in the 19th and 20th centuries. Important US buildings featuring scagliola include the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson, Mississippi (1903), Allen County Courthouse in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Belcourt Castle in Newport, Rhode Island, in the old El Paso County Courthouse (Colorado) in Colorado Springs, in the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka, Kansas, in Shea&#x27;s Performing Arts Center in Buffalo, New York, and in the Navarro County Courthouse in Corsicana, TX. St. Louis Union Station in St. Louis, Missouri, prominently features scagliola in its magnificent Grand Hall, the Rialto Square Theatre, Joliet, IL, Cathedral of St. Helena in Helena, MT, Congregation Shearith Israel in New York City, Milwaukee Public Library Central Library in Milwaukee, WI and the French Lick Resort Casino, French Lick, IN which recently underwent a major restoration.

Scagliola has historically been considered an &quot;Ersatz&quot; material and an inexpensive alternative to natural stone. However, it has eventually come to be recognised as an exceptional example of the plasterer&#x27;s craft and is now prized for its historic value as well as being used in new construction because of its benefits as a plastic material suited to molding in ornate shapes.

Scagliola columns are not generally built of the solid material. Instead scagliola is trowelled onto a canvas which is wrapped around the column&#x27;s core, and the canvas peeled away when semi-hardened. The scagliola is then surfaced in place.
The verd antique columns and pilasters in the Anteroom at Syon House are made out of marble not scagliola as it is widely perceived (a beautiful and rare, predominantly green marble that was quarried in Larissa of Greece since antiquity). These columns are not solid. Round sections of marble were painstakingly cut as a veneer of an approximate thickness of 5–6 mm and then glued onto a column core that is hollow and was probably made out of plaster. 

On closer inspection the viewer can see the joints of the various sections. The discerning eye will soon realise that they are looking at verd antique veneered marble and not verd antique scagliola. The 3.6 metre high verd antique scagliola columns that can be seen at Dropmore House, Buckinghamshire, are based on the colours and design of this historical work at Syon House. Both research and execution of these new columns were undertaken recently by the contemporary scagliolist Michael Koumbouzis.

<text>An election promise or campaign promise is a promise or guarantee made to the public by a candidate or political party that is trying to win an election.

Across the Western world, political parties aren&#x27;t highly likely to fulfill their election promises. In the United States, platform positions offer important clues as to the policies that U.S. parties will enact. Over the past 30 years, Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.

== Fulfilling promises ==

A 2017 study in the &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) found that political parties fulfill their promises to voters to a considerable extent:
Parties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.

=== Examples of broken promises ===

*The British Liberal Party&#x27;s pledge to cut army spending, before embarking on the Dreadnought arms race with Germany.
*The British Labour Party&#x27;s 1945 pledge to set up a new ministry of housing.
*Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, in 1987, said that &quot;by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty&quot;
*George H. W. Bush promised not to raise taxes while president during his 1988 campaign. This was best remembered in a speech at the Republican National Convention when he said &quot;Congress will push and push...and I&#x27;ll say Read my lips: no new taxes&quot;. After a recession began during his term and the deficit widened, Bush agreed to proposals to increase taxes. Although not the only broken promise concerning taxes, it was by far the most famous.
*In 1994, upon entering Italian politics, media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi promised that he would sell his assets in Fininvest (later Mediaset), because of the conflict of interest it would have generated, a promise he repeated a number of times in later years, but after 12 years and having served three terms as prime minister, he still retained ownership of his company that controls virtually all the Italian private TV stations and a large number of magazines and publishing houses, which have extensively been used in favour of his political party.
*Australian Prime Minister John Howard in 1995 that the GST would &quot;never ever&quot; be part of Liberal policy (the tax package was not implemented that term but was put to the Australian people at the next election in 1998 that re-elected Howard)
*During the 2000 U.S. Presidential election campaign, George W. Bush said, &quot;If we don&#x27;t stop extending our troops all around the world in nation-building missions, then we&#x27;re going to have a serious problem coming down the road. And I&#x27;m going to prevent that.&quot;
*In Ireland, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s 2002 election promise to &quot;permanently end all hospital waiting lists&quot; by 2004 and to &quot;create a world class health service&quot; through reform and expanding healthcare coverage with &quot;200,000 extra medical cards&quot;.
*When asked about the issue of carbon taxation, Prime Minister Julia Gillard responded by saying &quot;There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. What we will do is we will tackle the challenge of climate change.&quot; In February 2011, Gillard then announced a carbon pricing mechanism in order to secure a minority government. This has been construed by some as being a broken promise, with debate centering on whether or not a fixed price leading into a trading scheme can be called a &#x27;tax&#x27;.
*Before the 2011 Irish general election, the then Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore infamously said &quot;Frankfurt&#x27;s Way or Labour&#x27;s Way&quot; in reference to the EU/IMF deal. After being elected to power the party went on to accept the deal.
*Former U.S. President Barack Obama vowed repeatedly during the 2008 election to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, but the prison remained open the entirety of his Presidency and remains so .
*In the 2010 election to the U.K. House of Commons, the Liberal Democrat Party candidates took a pledge to oppose any increase in university tuition fees and campaign for their abolition. After forming a coalition government with the Tories, 21 of 57 Liberal Democrat MPs voted to increase the fees.
*During the Canadian federal election in 2015, Justin Trudeau promised to replace the first-past-the-post electoral system before the next federal election. He later rescinded this promise.
*President Donald Trump, as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, promised that he would imprison Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her email controversy, most notably during the 2016 Republican National Convention and the second presidential debate. After becoming President-elect, Trump announced he would not actually charge Clinton with any wrongdoing. The Trump Administration did not take any action against Clinton.
*In the 2019 general election in the United Kingdom the Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, pledged in their manifesto to not raise the rate of income tax, VAT or National Insurance. In September 2021, Johnson announced that National Insurance would be increased by 1.25 percentage points from April 2022 to raise money for the National Health Service and social care.
*In the 2023 parliamentary and presidential elections in Turkey the Justice and Development Party, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pledged in their manifesto to provide tax exemption for the acquisition of mobile phones and computers for youth in higher education for once without giving details of whether it will apply to imported or domestic products. In August 2023, Erdoğan&#x27;s cabinet announced that tax exemption for the acquisition of mobile phones and computers for youth would only encompass products produced or assembled in Turkey and have a price cap.

==Notes==
# p. 116 &quot;Nixon didn&#x27;t invent the phrase, which originated with a reporter looking for a lead to a story summarizing the Republican candidate&#x27;s (hazy) promise to end the war without losing. But neither did he disavow the term, and it soon became a part of the campaign. When pressed for details, Nixon retreated to the not indefensible position that to tip his hand would interfere with the negotiations that had begun in Paris.&quot;; Stated evidence suggests that Nixon never used the term, and that it actually came from a question by a voter at a New Hampshire campaign stop.

<text>Wild Honey is the thirteenth studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on December 18, 1967, by Capitol Records. It was the group&#x27;s first foray into soul music and was heavily influenced by the R&amp;B of Motown and Stax Records. The album was the band&#x27;s worst-selling at that point, charting at number 24 in the US. Lead single &quot;Wild Honey&quot; peaked at number 31, while its follow-up &quot;Darlin&quot; reached number 19. In the UK, the album peaked at number seven.

The album&#x27;s sessions began immediately after the recording of &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;, a failed live album, and the release of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, their previous LP. Like &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;″s core instrumental combo consists of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electric bass. The Beach Boys were inspired to regroup as a self-contained rock band, partly in response to critical assertions that they were &quot;ball-less choir boys&quot;. They also purposefully distanced themselves from the prevailing rock trends of the time, which had been typified by psychedelia and high-scale recording or thematic conceits.

It was the second album to credit &quot;the Beach Boys&quot; as producer. At his request, bandmate Carl Wilson began contributing more to the recording process, a trend that continued on subsequent albums. Mike Love also returned as Brian&#x27;s main songwriting collaborator for the first time since &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; (1965).

&quot;Wild Honey&quot; presaged a back-to-basics approach that was subsequently adopted by the Beach Boys&#x27; contemporaries, including Bob Dylan and the Beatles, and it is credited with pioneering the DIY pop genre. Most critics initially disregarded the record, but after the mid-1970s, a greater appreciation formed around its simplicity and charm, and has received retrospective critical acclaim with many citing it as one of the band&#x27;s finest works. In 1979, the track &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; was redone by the group as a disco single. In 2020, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was ranked number 410 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time”. A remixed and expanded edition, titled &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot;, was released in 2017.

==Background==
The Beach Boys&#x27; previous LP &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, released in September 1967, peaked at number 41 on US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for what was their worst performing album to date. A controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group had critics and fans divided, as journalist Gene Sculatti wrote at the time, &quot;the California sextet is simultaneously hailed as genius incarnate and derided as the archetypical pop music copouts.&quot; The unfinished album that &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; came to replace, &quot;Smile&quot;, had acquired considerable press, and Capitol Records was still interested in putting the album out. In July 1967, an internal memo circulated around Capitol Records that discussed imminent plans to follow up &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; with a 10-track version of the original &quot;Smile&quot;, but this never came to fruition.

Instead, the group traveled to Honolulu and attempted to record a live album, titled &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot;. There, Wilson intimated to a reporter that he enjoyed the contemporary &quot;pop scene&quot; and acknowledged that, even though &quot;the Beach Boys are squares&quot;, he did not feel personally hurt by such a reputation, citing the band&#x27;s past successes and the enjoyment they get from recording. However, Carl Wilson later said that &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was partly conceived as a response to criticisms against the band for &quot;sounding like choir boys&quot;. He recalled, &quot;there was one review that said Brian actually sounded like Mickey Mouse. That really tore him up.&quot; Upon their return to Los Angeles, in September, the group decided that the recordings were not suitable for release and attempted to redo the project as a live-in-the-studio album. After this, the band recorded the material that formed &quot;Wild Honey&quot;.

Meanwhile, two days after the release of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, Carl had produced some recordings for the songwriter Stephen Kalinich, who later became a collaborator for the group, and the songwriter&#x27;s partner Mark Buckingham. All of the tracks remain unreleased. In October, Murry Wilson, the band&#x27;s original manager, made his recording debut with the album &quot;The Many Moods of Murry Wilson&quot;, with one track composed by Al Jardine and produced by an uncredited Brian.

==Style and production==

&quot;Wild Honey&quot; is a soul album that mixes pop and R&amp;B styles. According to Mike Love, the band made a conscious decision to be &quot;completely out of the mainstream for what was going on at that time, which was all hard rock/psychedelic music. [The album] just didn&#x27;t have anything to do with what was going on.&quot; Brian said, &quot;we decided to make a rhythm&#x27;n&#x27;blues record. We consciously made a simpler album. It was just a little R&#x27;n&#x27;B and soul. It certainly wasn&#x27;t like a regular Beach Boys record.&quot; It was recorded mostly at the band&#x27;s private studio—located in Brian&#x27;s home—and may be retrospectively viewed as the second installment in a consecutive series of lo-fi Beach Boys albums. The recording sessions lasted only several weeks, compared to the several months required for their 1966 hit &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. Musicologist Christian Matijas-Mecca noted that &quot;while the album&#x27;s sparse production aesthetics and stripped-down sonic palette are deceiving, the album is arranged with an attention to detail and tonal clarity.&quot;

The album differs in many ways from previous Beach Boys records. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous R&amp;B outings—which typically consisted of Chuck Berry-derived riffs—most of &quot;Wild Honey&quot; drew on the emotive soul music associated with the Motown and Stax Records labels. Edwin Faust from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote that its music focuses &quot;simply on catchy hooks, snappy melodies and a straight-up boogie-woogie feel&quot;. Lenny Kaye, writing for &quot;Wondering Sound&quot;, felt that its &quot;R&amp;B leanings&quot; may be attributed to Mike Love and Carl Wilson&#x27;s vocal roles on the album. Carl said that his R&amp;B side had &quot;always wanted to come out. I have this massive collection of R&amp;B records. When we were doing &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, I&#x27;d go home and put on my Stax and Aretha stuff. It&#x27;s always been a big part of my life.&quot;

&quot;Wild Honey&quot; contains very little group singing compared to previous albums, and mainly features Brian singing at his piano. Musicologist Daniel Harrison writes that its &quot;simple songs&quot; lack the &quot;enigmatic weirdness&quot; and &quot;virtuosic mesmerizers&quot; present in &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, although they feature the same production approach and similar core instrumental combo of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electric bass. The piano was slightly detuned, which Brian said made it &quot;more like a twelve-string guitar, to get a more mellow sound. [...] I loved what it did to the sound of the record.&quot; Only five tracks were recorded with assistance from session musicians: &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad&quot;, &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot;, &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;. Some sessions were held at Wally Heider Recording in Los Angeles in order to accommodate the musicians with a larger recording space for overdubs.

Bruce Johnston recalled, &quot;we wanted to be a band again. The whole [&quot;Smile&quot;] thing had wiped everyone out, and we wanted to play together again.&quot; Harrison describes &quot;Wild Honey&quot; as a self-conscious attempt by the Beach Boys to &quot;regroup&quot; themselves as a rock band in opposition to their more orchestral affairs of the past. By this time, Brian had grown weary of producing the Beach Boys after having done it for several years, and so he requested that Carl contribute more to the process. Brian stated that his brother &quot;really got into [...] the production side of things&quot; starting with &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. Moreover, Brian said, &quot;People expected me to come up with great orchestral stuff all the time and it became a burden.&quot; He is credited as composer or co-composer for 9 of 11 tracks, compared to &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; in which he held a songwriting credit for every track. It was The Beach Boys&#x27; last album to be mixed in mono.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Wild Honey&quot; was co-written by Mike Love from the perspective of Stevie Wonder singing it. Session musician Paul Tanner was recruited to play his Electro-Theremin on the track.

&quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad&quot; is a song in the style of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. Biographer Byron Preiss wrote that it &quot;epitomizes&quot; the album&#x27;s &quot;simple energy&quot;, while magazine editor Gene Sculatti says it &quot;achieves a Miracles style smoothness via a Bobby Goldsboro-type song&quot;. 

&quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot; was originally recorded by Wonder, who had a number 2 hit with the song in July 1967. A popular misconception is that Carl sings the phrase &quot;son of a bitch&quot; on this track.

&quot;Country Air&quot; describes the scene of the sun rising over rural America. The group repeatedly harmonizes in the chorus, &quot;Get a breath of that country air / breathe the beauty of it everywhere&quot;.&quot; It was cited by Brian as his &quot;favorite cut on the record.&quot; There is a technical anomaly with the master tape that caused the track to have a buzzing noise throughout.

&quot;A Thing or Two&quot; is identified by Christian Matijas-Mecca as a &quot;sibling&quot; to &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;″s &quot;Gettin&#x27; Hungry&quot;. The vocal riff would be reprised in the group&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;Do It Again&quot;.

===Side two===
&quot;Darlin&quot; is a song that had been reworked from an earlier Brian Wilson/Mike Love composition, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout You Baby&quot;. Initially, Brian had planned to give &quot;Darlin″&quot; (along with &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot;) to Three Dog Night, then called &quot;Redwood&quot;, before Carl and Love insisted that Brian focus his attention on producing work for the Beach Boys. Redwood&#x27;s version of &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; was released on the 1993 compilation &quot;&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;d Love Just Once to See You&quot; prefigured the writing style that Brian would later explore in the next studio album &quot;Friends&quot;. Throughout the song, he sings about ordinary activities such as washing the dishes, before ending it with the line, &quot;I&#x27;d love just once to see you / in the nude&quot;.

&quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; is another soulful R&amp;B song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love. In 1979, The Beach Boys would make a near eleven-minute disco cover of this song for their twenty-third studio album, &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot;.

&quot;Let the Wind Blow&quot; was the first composition recorded by the group that is in time from beginning to end. According to biographers Andrew Doe and John Tobler, it was composed primarily by Love and &quot;rearranged&quot; by Brian.

&quot;How She Boogaloed It&quot; is one of the album&#x27;s more uptempo songs. It was the first original Beach Boys song (excluding instrumentals and cover versions) not to feature contributions from Brian.

&quot;Mama Says&quot; is a chant that originated from an unreleased version of the &quot;Smile&quot; song &quot;Vegetables&quot;. It was the first time a track linked to &quot;Smile&quot; was used to close a later Beach Boys album, the others being &quot;20/20&quot; (1969), &quot;Sunflower&quot; (1970) and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; (1971). Inexplicably, when the alternate &quot;Mama Says&quot; version of &quot;Vegetables&quot; was released, Van Dyke Parks&#x27; songwriting credit was not honored, and instead Love was listed as the song&#x27;s only co-writer.

===Leftover===
Outtakes from the &quot;Wild Honey&quot; sessions include the originals &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Too Long&quot;, &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot;, &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;, &quot;Honey Get Home&quot;, and &quot;Lonely Days&quot;.&quot;Can&#x27;t Wait Too Long&quot; was released on the 1990/2001 two-fer reissue, while &quot;Time to Get Alone&quot; and &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot; were released on subsequent albums &quot;20/20&quot; and &quot;Sunflower&quot; respectively. A solo recording of Brian performing the &quot;Smile&quot; song &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was lost and rediscovered several decades later at the end of the multi-track reel for &quot;Country Air&quot;. Archivist Mark Linett stated: &quot;No explanation for why he did that and it was never taken any farther. Although I don&#x27;t think the intention was to take it any farther because it&#x27;s just him singing live and playing piano.&quot; This recording would see release on the 2011 compilation &quot;The Smile Sessions&quot;. The band also recorded cover versions of the Box Tops hit &quot;The Letter&quot; (1967), Clint Ballard Jr.&#x27;s &quot;The Game of Love&quot; (1965), and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; (1967), as well as Johnston&#x27;s demo for &quot;Bluebirds over the Mountain&quot;. The &quot;New York Observer&quot;″s Ron Hart said that the significance of the Beach Boys covering &quot;The Letter&quot; as sung by Alex Chilton is &quot;simply beyond comprehension [...] for that special kind of music nerd.&quot;

On October 13, 1967, Capitol announced that the Beach Boys&#x27; next release would be &quot;Wild Honey&quot; and offered its track listing, even though some of the songs had yet to be recorded at that point. Among its differences, &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot;, &quot;Country Air&quot;, and &quot;Mama Says&quot; were not included, while &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;, &quot;Game of Love&quot;, &quot;The Letter&quot; (live version from Hawaii), and &quot;Lonely Days&quot; were. &quot;Honey Get Home&quot; was also listed, but crossed out. &quot;The Letter&quot; was to serve as a teaser for the forthcoming live album before the plans for the record were dropped.

==Cover and title==
The image on the front of the &quot;Wild Honey&quot; sleeve is a small section of an elaborate stained-glass window that adorned Brian&#x27;s home in Bel Air.

In the liner notes, friend Arnie Geller and the Wilsons&#x27; cousin Steve Korthoff wrote, &quot;Honey, of the wild variety, on a shelf in Brian&#x27;s kitchen, was not only an aide to all of the Beach Boys&#x27; health but the source of inspiration for the record, &quot;Wild Honey&quot;&quot;. Three Dog Night singer Danny Hutton supported, &quot;The vibe was still great. [Brian would] have me over and he&#x27;d suddenly say: &#x27;I&#x27;ve got this idea, man!&#x27; Then he&#x27;d point to a jar of wild honey. &#x27;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s what the album&#x27;s gonna be called!&#x27; And the other guys were thrilled.&quot;

Alternatively, Mike Love said he originated the title after finding a jar of honey in Wilson&#x27;s cupboard. He felt that the title was suggestive of both edible honey and &quot;honey&quot; as a term of endearment, Wilson recalled in a 2012 interview, &quot;People still think this record came about because of some wild honey I&#x27;m supposed to have kept in my kitchen, but I don&#x27;t remember that being true.&quot;

==Release ==
Lead single &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was issued on October 23, 1967, with a B-side taken from &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wind Chimes&quot;. The single peaked at number 31 in the US and number 20 in the UK. From November 17 to 26, the touring group embarked on their fifth annual Thanksgiving tour of the US, with set lists that included four songs from the upcoming album: &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, &quot;Darlin, &quot;Country Air&quot;, and &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot;. Keyboardist Daryl Dragon and bassist Ron Brown supported the band on stage. On December 15, the band performed their only studio-televised live performance of the year at a UNICEF Variety Gala in Paris, for a program titled &quot;Gala Variety from Paris&quot;, which also featured several other celebrities, including Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

&quot;Wild Honey&quot; was issued in the US on December 18, accompanied by the single &quot;Darlin (backed with &quot;Here Today&quot; from &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;). It was released at a contrast to the psychedelic music that occupied the record charts, and in competition with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. &quot;Wild Honey&quot; became the Beach Boys&#x27; lowest-selling album at that point and remained on the charts for only 15 weeks. &quot;Darlin peaked at number 24 in the US, as did &quot;Wild Honey&quot;. When the single was reissued in January with the B-side &quot;Country Air&quot;, it peaked at number 11. In March, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 7.

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary===
Like &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was viewed by contemporary critics as an inconsequential work, and it alienated audiences whose expectations had been raised by the hype generated for &quot;Smile&quot;, although received better reviews than Smiley Smile and was considered in some parts an improvement. The group remained effectively blacklisted by the music press, to the extent that reviews of the group&#x27;s records were either withheld from publication or published long after the release dates. Writing in his 1969 book &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;, Paul Williams summarized that &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was &quot;a work of joy [...] new and fresh and raw and beautiful&quot;, and said that while the album&#x27;s boogie woogie piano riffs were, &quot;in their own way, as inventive as Brian&#x27;s more textured records [...] we expected more (from Brian) than we would expect from any other composer alive, because the tracks we&#x27;d heard from &quot;Smile&quot; were just that good. &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was [...] a confusion [...] and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is just another Beach Boys record.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewed that the Beach Boys regained their better judgement after the &quot;disaster&quot; of &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, although their use of &quot;pre-existing ideas and idioms&quot; on &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is less satisfactory and original than their earlier work: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of amusing that the Beach Boys are suddenly re-discovering rhythm and blues five years after the Beatles and Stones had brought it all back home&quot;. &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot;″s Gene Sculatti wrote: &quot;[the Beach Boys] have the audacity to fool around with r&amp;b, a territory indeed alien to them. Surprisingly, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; works well. It isn&#x27;t the least bit pretentious, it&#x27;s honest, and convincing.&quot; In a column for &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that the album &quot;epitomizes Brian Wilson&quot;, including the song &quot;I&#x27;d Love Just Once to See You&quot;, which &quot;expresses perfectly his quiet, thoughtful, sentimental artistic personality.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; welcomed the band&#x27;s return to form after the &quot;avant-garde&quot; &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, but was critical of &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot; as &quot;far below the group&#x27;s quality&quot; and predicted that &quot;I&#x27;d Love Just Once to See You&quot; would not receive airplay.

&quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; awarded the album &quot;LP of the Month&quot; and wrote that it was the band&#x27;s best since &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;Others who, like us, felt Brian Wilson was becoming bogged down in his complex arrangements can relax and listen to the most refreshing sounds for many months.&quot; In a 1968 &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; article, David Anderle reported that the Doors&#x27; Jim Morrison considered Brian Wilson &quot;his favorite musician&quot; and &quot;Wild Honey&quot; &quot;one of his favorite albums. [...] he really got into it.&quot;

===Retrospective===

Like &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was later reevaluated by fans and critics who highlighted the record for its simplicity and charm, particularly after the LP was reissued by Warner Bros. in 1974. In his 1971 review of &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Arthur Schmidt referred to &quot;Wild Honey&quot; as &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, &quot;the most underrated&quot; of the band&#x27;s &quot;post-surfer LPs&quot;, and &quot;the last time they truly rocked their asses off, one cut after another.&quot; In a 1976 retrospective guide to 1967 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Christgau felt &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is &quot;so slight&quot; but &quot;perfect and full of pleasure&quot;. He argued that, &quot;almost without a bad second&quot;, the album conveys &quot;the troubled innocence of the Beach Boys through a time of attractive but perilous psychedelic sturm und drang. Its method is whimsy, candor, and carefully modulated amateurishness, all of which comes through as humor.&quot;

Critic Geoffrey Himes called the record &quot;10 wonderful celebrations of everyday life and a terrific Stevie Wonder cover. Wonder, though, never sang odes to clean air and refreshing wind or made boyish jokes about seeing a naked woman or brushing one&#x27;s teeth.&quot; Record producer Tony Visconti listed &quot;Wild Honey&quot; as one of his 13 favorite albums and said that &quot;I still refer to this record as a benchmark in the same way that I do &quot;Revolver&quot;.&quot; In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the record at number 410 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was also ranked second on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of the &quot;Coolest Summer Albums of All Time&quot; list, with the editors praising the record&#x27;s &quot;hedonistic rock &amp; roll spirit&quot;, &quot;humor&quot; and &quot;pensive depth&quot;.

Less favorably, Richie Unterberger wrote in his review for AllMusic that, apart from &quot;Darlin, &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; and the title track, most of &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was &quot;inessential&quot;. He found the music &quot;often quite pleasant, for the great harmonies if nothing else, but the material and arrangements were quite simply thinner than they had been for a long time.&quot; Sommer wrote that the album&#x27;s original mono mix suffers from being &quot;flat and peculiar&quot;. In the lyrics to the Beta Band&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is hailed for its &quot;funny little love songs&quot; although considered &quot;probably not as good as something like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;.

In a negative review, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Spencer Owen said only &quot;one or two&quot; songs succeed and the majority of &quot;Wild Honey&quot; is &quot;not pretty&quot; because of its R&amp;B vein as &quot;interpreted by white surfer boys&quot;, including &quot;a Stevie Wonder cover sung with as much faux-soul as Carl Wilson could have possibly mustered&quot;. Writing in his &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin pairs the album with the &quot;scrappy&quot; &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; as two &quot;hastily released&quot; works that show how the Beach Boys&#x27; music had &quot;lost its cohesiveness&quot;, with Brian Wilson&#x27;s reduced involvement. Noel Gallagher, who considers the Beach Boys to be &quot;the most vastly overrated band in the history of popular culture&quot;, named &quot;How She Boogalooed It&quot; among the group&#x27;s only &quot;six good tunes&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
===Back-to-basics trend and DIY music===
In the wake of &quot;Wild Honey&quot;, numerous contemporaries of the Beach Boys adopted a similar back-to-basics approach, including Bob Dylan (&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;), the Band (&quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;), the Beatles (&quot;The Beatles&quot;), and the Rolling Stones (&quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;). &quot;Uncut&quot;″s David Cavanaugh remarked that despite the poor critical response afforded to the album at the time of its release, &quot;Wild Honey&quot; heralded rock trends of the late 1960s and effectively pioneered &quot;a post-psychedelic music while the Summer of Love was still in full swing. And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, The Beatles&#x27; &#x27;Lady Madonna&#x27; would get the credit.&quot; Author Mike Segretto echoed, &quot;Ten days before Dylan got all the credit for popping the psychedelic balloon with &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, the Beach Boys had done it first with &quot;Wild Honey&quot;.&quot;

Similarly, music journalist Tim Sommer characterized the album as boldly subverting &quot;rock&#x27;s expansion into pompous avenues of volume, psychedelia and lyrical pretension&quot; and called it a precursor to albums such as the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Village Green Preservation Society&quot; and the Byrds&#x27; &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; (both 1968). Editors at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credited the LP with starting &quot;the idea of DIY pop&quot;.

===&quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot;===
In 2017, a complete stereo mix of &quot;Wild Honey&quot; was released for the first time on the rarities compilation &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow&quot;. The set also includes numerous session highlights, alternate takes, and live renditions of &quot;Wild Honey&quot; tracks in addition to other unreleased material recorded during the &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and &quot;Lei&#x27;d in Hawaii&quot; era. Several months later, the compilation was followed with two more digital-exclusive releases: &quot;1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow 2: The Studio Sessions&quot; and &quot;1967 – Live Sunshine&quot;. They include more than 100 tracks that were left off the first compilation.

<text>The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy is a book published by economists James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock in 1962. It is considered to be one of the classic works from the discipline of public choice in economics and political science. This work presents the basic principles of public choice theory.

==Overview==
The analytical approach of the authors is based on &quot;methodological individualism&quot; - collective action is composed of individual actions and on the rejection of any organic interpretation of the state. A purely individualistic conception of collectivity is maintained: the state is an artifact, created by men and thus subject to change and perfection. Buchanan and Tullock maintain that only constitutional changes, which can be shown to be in the interest of all interested parties, can be judged as &quot;improvements&quot; and therefore consider conceptual unanimity as the only legitimate decision-making rule.

The authors analyze the traditional political science approach to voting systems, including majority voting as the standard as opposed to the unanimity rule. They show that none of those systems is perfect, since there is always a tradeoff:
* a simple majority-based system imposes varying amounts of both external costs and decision-making costs
* a unanimity-based system has little or no external costs, but considerable decision-making costs.
They conclude that decisions with potentially high external costs should require unanimity or at least supermajority systems.

While many political scientists define the political process as a system in which the policy decisions are viewed as a private interest vs. public interest struggle, Buchanan and Tullock suggest that the public interest is simply the aggregation of private decision makers.

They show that in classical political science theory, the &quot;public interest&quot; is always the correct choice with the same appeal to all voters, which may or may not be opposed by &quot;special interests&quot;. But that theory ignores the fact that most choices appeal to many different &quot;law consumers&quot; with varying strengths. An illustrative example is a choice whether to increase funding for health care. Some voters will strongly support or oppose it, but many may not care at all.

They compare this to a market transaction, where the voters strongly desiring better health care could purchase the acceptance of the opposition and uninterested voters with concessions, resulting in an efficient allocation of resources, increasing the happiness of all parties (Pareto optimality). However the equivalent of this in the political realm is that politicians buy the votes of other politicians (or groups of special interest) by promising to vote for their issues. In the authors&#x27; opinion such log-rolling is to be expected, but in the traditional political science theory, it is anomalous. Thus their model explains certain things that the previous models of politics could not.

Employing the theoretical concepts of game theory and Pareto optimality, Buchanan and Tullock show that symmetry in benefits sharing may be at most a &quot;necessary&quot;, but never a &quot;sufficient&quot; condition for the attainment of a Pareto optimal position. The introduction of side payments is the crucial element, which would lead to optimality. In a sense the introduction of side payments creates marketable property rights of the individual political vote (Chapter 12).

<doc id="719507" wikidata="Q1468104" url="?curid=719507" title="Matanuska River">
<text>The Matanuska River (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;Ch&#x27;atanhtnu&quot;; Ahtna: &quot;Ts&#x27;itonhna’&quot;) is a 75-mile (121 km) long river in Southcentral Alaska, United States. The river drains a broad valley south of the Alaska Range eponymously known as the Matanuska Valley.

==Course==
Formed by the confluence of its east and south forks, the Matanuska River flows generally southwest to the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet. Downstream of its source, the river is joined by meltwater from Matanuska Glacier in the northern Chugach Mountains. From there it continues through the Matanuska Valley, between the Chugach Mountains to the south and the Talkeetna Mountains to the north. Population centers along its course include Chickaloon, Sutton, Palmer, and Butte. It enters the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet about southwest of Palmer and about northeast of Anchorage.

The Glenn Highway runs roughly parallel to the river for much of its length. Highway bridges over the river, listed from source to mouth, include Glacier Park Bridge, Chickaloon River Bridge, King River Bridge, Old Glenn Highway Bridge, and Glenn Highway Bridge. An Alaska Railroad bridge crosses the river parallel to the Glenn Highway Bridge at Palmer Hay Flats State Game Refuge. Mantanuska Glacier State Recreation Site is along the highway where Glacier Creek enters the river; King Mountain State Recreation Site is near Chickaloon, and Kepler – Bradley Lakes State Recreation Area is near Palmer.

In addition to the glacier, named and unnamed streams that drain the Talkeetna and Chugach ranges feed into the river. These include Glacier, Hicks, Purinton, Caribou, and Coal creeks, and the Chickaloon and King rivers, and many others. The main stem is silty with glacial run-off from spring through fall but at lower flows beneath winter ice, it runs relatively clear.

The Matanuska Valley is one of the most settled regions of Alaska and one of the few areas in the state to support agriculture. Erosion by the glacial braided river has damaged roads, farms, houses, and houses for decades.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey operates a stream gauge near Palmer. Mean monthly discharge at this gauge varies from in March to in July. The maximum recorded flow was on August 10, 1971, after the break-out of a natural reservoir on Granite Creek. The minimum recorded flow of occurred on April 25, 1956.

==Boating==
The river is a popular destination for whitewater enthusiasts who float mainly in rafts or kayaks. Accessible at several bridges and other points along the Glenn Highway, the Matanuska varies from Class II (medium) to III (difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Expert paddlers sometimes run a tributary, Caribou Creek, that flows past Matanuska Glacier and is rated Class II to IV (very difficult). Hazards along the main stem include swift, cold water; big standing waves and holes along some sections; overhanging or submerged vegetation on the lower reaches, and upriver winds.

==Etymology==
The indigenous Dena&#x27;ina Athabascan name for the river is &quot;Ch&#x27;atanhtnu&quot;, based on the root &quot;-tanh&quot; &quot;trail extends out&quot;, meaning literally &quot;trail comes out river&quot;. The English place name &quot;Matanuska&quot; derives from a Russian term spelled in various ways, including &quot;Matanooski&quot; and &quot;Mednoviska&quot;, and meaning &quot;copper river people&quot;, perhaps referring to an implied route from Cook Inlet to the Copper River.

<text>The Frankfurt Galaxy were a professional American football team that originally played in the World League of American Football and later in the resurrected NFL Europe. The team was based in Frankfurt, Germany and played in the Commerzbank-Arena, formerly called Waldstadion. The Galaxy was the only team in the league to have remained in operation and in the same city throughout the league&#x27;s existence.

As of 2021, an unrelated team of the same name plays in the European League of Football.

==History==
In 1991, the Galaxy was a founding member of the World League of American Football (WLAF). They hosted the first ever WLAF game against the London Monarchs at the Waldstadion on March 23, 1991, and scored the first ever WLAF points with a safety, but lost the game.

When the World League resumed in 1995, the Galaxy, the Monarchs, and Barcelona Dragons were the only former WLAF teams that continued playing. Before it folded, Frankfurt Galaxy was the oldest professional football team outside of the NFL and CFL. Frankfurt Galaxy also played in the last NFL Europa game, losing the 2007 World Bowl to the Hamburg Seadevils.

The Frankfurt Galaxy&#x27;s record eight appearances in the 15 World Bowl games were evenly split in the composite standings with four wins (1995, 1999, 2003 and 2006) and four losses (1996, 1998, 2004, and 2007).

<doc id="719509" wikidata="Q4529558" url="?curid=719509" title="Stabilizing selection">
<text>Stabilizing selection (not to be confused with negative or purifying selection) is a type of natural selection in which the population mean stabilizes on a particular non-extreme trait value. This is thought to be the most common mechanism of action for natural selection because most traits do not appear to change drastically over time. Stabilizing selection commonly uses negative selection (a.k.a. purifying selection) to select against extreme values of the character. Stabilizing selection is the opposite of disruptive selection. Instead of favoring individuals with extreme phenotypes, it favors the intermediate variants. Stabilizing selection tends to remove the more severe phenotypes, resulting in the reproductive success of the norm or average phenotypes. This means that most common phenotype in the population is selected for and continues to dominate in future generations.
==History==

The Russian evolutionary biologist Ivan Schmalhausen founded the theory of stabilizing selection, publishing a paper in Russian titled &quot;Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution&quot; in 1941 and a monograph &quot;Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection&quot; in 1945.

== Influence on population structure ==
Stabilizing selection causes the narrowing of the phenotypes seen in a population. This is because the extreme phenotypes are selected against, causing reduced survival in organisms with those traits. This results in a population consisting of fewer phenotypes, with most traits representing the mean value of the population. This narrowing of phenotypes causes a reduction in genetic diversity in a population. Maintaining genetic variation is essential for the survival of a population because it is what allows them to evolve over time. In order for a population to adapt to changing environmental conditions they must have enough genetic diversity to select for new traits as they become favorable.

== Analyzing stabilizing selection ==
There are four primary types of data used to quantify stabilizing selection in a population. The first type of data is an estimation of fitness of different phenotypes within a single generation. Quantifying fitness in a single generation creates predictions for the expected fate of selection. The second type of data is changes in allelic frequencies or phenotypes across different generations. This allows quantification of change in prevalence of a certain phenotype, indicating the type of selection. The third type of data is differences in allelic frequencies across space. This compares selection occurring in different populations and environmental conditions. The fourth type of data is DNA sequences from the genes contributing to observes phenotypic differences. The combination of these four types of data allow population studies that can identify the type of selection occurring and quantify the extent of selection.

However, a meta-analysis of studies that measured selection in the wild failed to find an overall trend for stabilizing selection. The reason can be that methods for detecting stabilizing selection are complex. They can involve studying the changes that causes natural selection in the mean and variance of the trait, or measuring fitness for a range of different phenotypes under natural conditions and examining the relationship between these fitness measurements and the trait value, but analysis and interpretation of the results is not straightforward.

== Examples ==
The most common form of stabilizing selection is based on phenotypes of a population. In phenotype based stabilizing selection, the mean value of a phenotype is selected for, resulting a decrease in the phenotypic variation found in a population.

Stabilizing selection is the most common form of nonlinear selection (non-directional) in humans. There are few examples of genes with direct evidence of stabilizing selection in humans. However, most quantitative traits (height, birthweight, schizophrenia) are thought to be under stabilizing selection, due to their polygenicity and the distribution of the phenotypes throughout human populations.

* Birth Weight − A classic example of this is human birth weight. Babies of low weight lose heat more quickly and get ill from infectious diseases more easily, whereas babies of large body weight are more difficult to deliver through the pelvis. Infants of a more medium weight survive much more often. For the larger or smaller babies, the baby mortality rate is much higher. The bell curve of the human population peaks at a birth weight that the newly born babies exhibit the minimum death rate.

=== Plants ===

* Height − Another example of a trait, that might be acted on by stabilizing selection, is plant height. A plant that is too short may not be able to compete with other plants for sunlight. However, extremely tall plants may be more susceptible to wind damage. Combined, these two selection pressures select to maintain plants of medium height. The number of plants of medium height will increase while the numbers of short and tall plants will decrease.
* Cacti Spine Number − Desert populations of spiny cacti experience predation by peccaries, which consume the fleshy part of the cactus. This can be prevented by increasing the number of spines on the cactus. However, there is also a selection pressure in the opposite direction because there is a parasitic insect that will lay its eggs in spines if they are densely populated. This means that in order to manage both of these selection pressures the cacti experiences stabilizing selection to balance the appropriate number of spines to survive these different threats.

=== Insects ===

*Butterfly&#x27;s Winged Eyespots − The African butterfly &quot;Bicyclus anynana&quot; exhibits stabilizing selection with its wing eyespots. It has been suggested that the circular eyespots positioned on the wings are favoured functionally compared to other shapes and sizes.
* Gall Size − The &quot;Eurosta solidaginis&quot; fly lays its eggs on the tip of plants, which then encase the larvae in a protective gall. The size of this gall is under stabilizing selection, as determined by predation. These larvae are under threat from parasitic wasps, which lay a single egg in galls containing the flies. The single wasp offspring then consumes the fly larvae to survive. Therefore, a larger gall is favored to allow more places for larvae to hide from the wasp. However, larger galls attract a different type of predation from birds, as they can penetrate large galls with their beak. Therefore, the optimal gall is moderately sized in order to avoid predation from both birds and wasps.

=== Birds ===

* Clutch Size − The number of eggs laid by a female bird (clutch size) is typically under stabilizing selection. This is because the female must lay as many eggs as possible to maximize the number of offspring. However, they can only lay as many eggs as they can support with their own resources. Laying too many eggs could expend all of the energy of the mother bird causing her to die and the death of the chicks. Additionally, once the eggs hatch the mother must be able to obtain enough resources to keep all of the chicks alive. Therefore, the mother typically lays a moderate amount of eggs in order to increase offspring survival and maximize the number of offspring.

=== Mammals ===
*The Siberian husky experiences stabilizing selection in terms of their leg muscles. These dogs have to have enough muscle in order to pull sleds and move quickly. However, they also must be light enough to stay on top of the snow. This means that the leg muscles of the husky are most fit when they are moderately sized, to balance their strength and their weight.

<text>Direct Line is an insurance company based in Bromley, England. Founded in 1985, as the country&#x27;s first direct car insurance company, it has since expanded to offer a range of general insurance products. Its policies are underwritten by the regulated subsidiary UK Insurance Limited, and it is owned by the Direct Line Group.

==History==
It was founded in Croydon by Martin Long and Peter Wood in 1985 as the insurance division of Royal Bank of Scotland.

In 1988, it started to sell home insurance. Direct Line is renowned for having transformed financial services in the United Kingdom.

The mascot had altered slightly over the years; being accompanied by a red mouse on wheels to represent the company&#x27;s website in 2005, which was dropped in 2020, with another re brand leaving the phone on its own once more. In September 2014, the brand worked with Saatchi and Saatchi to relaunch its advertising, which saw Hollywood actor Harvey Keitel reprise his role as the character Winston Wolfe from the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The company had one million customers after eight years by June 2003.

The innovations extended into the 2000s with the launch of the first online claims registration and tracking facility in the United Kingdom for its motor insurance customers in 2001, and Home Response 24 Emergency Insurance, launching in 2003.

In December 2024, Direct Line launched three motor insurance products on the price comparison website which are available on Compare the Market.

==Controversy==
In January 2012, Direct Line, along with sister company Churchill Insurance, was fined £2.17m by the FSA, after being found guilty of altering complaints files.

==Awards==
Direct Line has won a number of awards including:

* Financial Services Forum Awards 2016: Advertising; Customer Experience; Customer Loyalty and Retention, Judges&#x27; Special Award for Marketing Excellence.
* YourMoney.com Awards 2016: Direct Winners – Best Direct Car Insurance Provider
* Your Money Awards 2015: Direct Winners – Best Direct Car Insurance Provider

==Rebranding==
In Italy and Germany, Direct Line was acquired by MAPFRE Group in September 2014, and re branded to Verti in January 2017. Verti is a brand owned by MAPFRE Group, operating in Italy, Germany, Spain and the United States.

<doc id="719525" wikidata="Q529321" url="?curid=719525" title="Cologne Centurions (NFL Europe)">
<text>The Cologne Centurions were an American football team that played in NFL Europe. The Centurions began competing in the league in the 2004 season, having replaced the defunct Barcelona Dragons. They played their home games at RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne.

The Centurions&#x27; first-ever game was against local rival Rhein Fire. Cologne lost 25–26. The Centurions&#x27; inaugural season finished with a 4–6 record.

On 21 February 2006, the Centurions named David Duggan as their new head coach. He replaced Darryl Sims, who was on the verge of his first season in the position but instead was pursuing an opportunity in the NFL. Peter Vaas, a two-time World Bowl-winning coach with the Berlin Thunder, had occupied the job in the team&#x27;s first two seasons. The Centurions were the only NFL Europe team who were still in existence at the leagues end that never won a World Bowl.

An unrelated team of the same name is to play in the inaugural 2021 season of the new European League of Football

<doc id="719534" wikidata="Q901921" url="?curid=719534" title="Biological carbon fixation">
<text>Biological carbon fixation, or сarbon assimilation, is the process by which living organisms convert inorganic carbon (particularly carbon dioxide, ) to organic compounds. These organic compounds are then used to store energy and as structures for other biomolecules. Carbon is primarily fixed through photosynthesis, but some organisms use chemosynthesis in the absence of sunlight. Chemosynthesis is carbon fixation driven by chemical energy rather than from sunlight.

The process of biological carbon fixation plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, as it serves as the primary mechanism for removing from the atmosphere and incorporating it into living biomass. The primary production of organic compounds allows carbon to enter the biosphere. Carbon is considered essential for life as a base element for building organic compounds. The element of carbon forms the bases biogeochemical cycles (or nutrient cycles) and drives communities of living organisms. Understanding biological carbon fixation is essential for comprehending ecosystem dynamics, climate regulation, and the sustainability of life on Earth.

Organisms that grow by fixing carbon, such as most plants and algae, are called autotrophs. These include photoautotrophs (which use sunlight) and lithoautotrophs (which use inorganic oxidation). Heterotrophs, such as animals and fungi, are not capable of carbon fixation but are able to grow by consuming the carbon fixed by autotrophs or other heterotrophs. 

Seven natural autotrophic carbon fixation pathways are currently known. They are the: i) Calvin-Benson-Bassham (Calvin Cycle), ii) Reverse Krebs (rTCA) cycle, iii) the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway), iv) 3-hydroxy propionate [3-HP] bicycle, v) 3-hydroypropionate/4- hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle, vi) the dicarboxylate/ 4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4-HB) cycle, and vii) the reductive glycine (rGly) pathway. &quot;Fixed carbon,&quot; &quot;reduced carbon,&quot; and &quot;organic carbon&quot; may all be used interchangeably to refer to various organic compounds.

== Net vs. gross CO2 fixation ==

The primary form of fixed inorganic carbon is carbon dioxide (CO2). It is estimated that approximately 250 billion tons of carbon dioxide are converted by photosynthesis annually, nearly one half in the oceans and a bit more in terrestrial environments. The majority of the fixation in terrestrial environments occurs in the tropics. The gross amount of carbon dioxide fixed is much larger since approximately 40% is consumed by respiration following photosynthesis. Historically, it is estimated that approximately 2×1011 billion tons of carbon has been fixed since the origin of life.

== Overview of the carbon fixation cycles ==
Seven autotrophic carbon fixation pathways are known: the Calvin Cycle, the Reverse Krebs Cycle, the reductive acetyl-CoA, the 3-HP bicycle, the 3-HP/4-HB cycle, the DC/4-HB cycles, and the reductive glycine pathway.

The organisms the Calvin cycle is found in are plants, algae, cyanobacteria, aerobic proteobacteria, and purple bacteria. The Calvin cycle fixes carbon in the chloroplasts of plants and algae, and in the cyanobacteria. It also fixes carbon in the anoxygenic photosynthesis in one type of Pseudomonadota called purple bacteria, and in some non-phototrophic Pseudomonadota.

Of the other autotrophic pathways, three are known only in bacteria (the reductive citric acid cycle, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, and the reductive glycine pathway), two only in archaea (two variants of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle), and one in both bacteria and archaea (the reductive acetyl CoA pathway). Sulfur- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria often use the Calvin cycle or the reductive citric acid cycle.

== List of pathways ==
=== Calvin cycle ===
The Calvin cycle accounts for 90% of biological carbon fixation. Consuming adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the Calvin cycle in plants accounts for the predominance of carbon fixation on land. In algae and cyanobacteria, it accounts for the dominance of carbon fixation in the oceans. The Calvin cycle converts carbon dioxide into sugar, as triose phosphate (TP), which is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) together with dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP):
: 3 CO2 + 12 e− + 12 H+ + Pi → TP + 4 H2O
An alternative perspective accounts for NADPH (source of e−) and ATP:

: 3 CO2 + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ + 9 ATP + 5 H2O → TP + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi

The formula for inorganic phosphate (Pi) is HOPO32− + 2 H+.Formulas for triose and TP are C2H3O2-CH2OH and C2H3O2-CH2OPO32− + 2 H+.

=== Reverse Krebs cycle ===
The reverse Krebs cycle, also known as the reverse TCA cycle (rTCA) or reductive citric acid cycle, is an alternative to the standard Calvin-Benson cycle for carbon fixation. It has been found in strict anaerobic or microaerobic bacteria (as &quot;Aquificales&quot;) and anaerobic archea. It was discovered by Evans, Buchanan and Arnon in 1966 working with the photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium &quot;Chlorobium limicola&quot;. In particular, it is one of the most used pathways in hydrothermal vents by the Campylobacterota. This feature allows primary production in the ocean&#x27;s aphotic environments, or &quot;dark primary production.&quot; Without it, there would be no primary production in aphotic environments, which would lead to habitats without life. 

The cycle involves the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA from two molecules of CO2. The key steps of the reverse Krebs cycle are:

* Oxaloacetate to malate, using NADH + H+
* Fumarate to succinate, catalyzed by an oxidoreductase, Fumarate reductase
* Succinate to succinyl-CoA, an ATP-dependent step
* Succinyl-CoA to alpha-ketoglutarate, using one molecule of CO2
* Alpha-ketoglutarate to isocitrate, using NADPH + H+ and another molecule of CO2
* Citrate converted into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, this is an ATP dependent step and the key enzyme is the ATP citrate lyase

This pathway is cyclic due to the regeneration of the oxaloacetate.

The bacteria Gammaproteobacteria and &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot; switch from the Calvin-Benson cycle to the rTCA cycle in response to concentrations of H2S.
=== Reductive acetyl CoA pathway ===
The reductive acetyl CoA pathway (CoA) pathway, also known as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway uses CO2 as electron acceptor and carbon source, and H2 as an electron donor to form acetic acid. This metabolism is widespread within the phylum Bacillota, especially in the Clostridia.

The pathway is also used by methanogens, which are mainly Euryarchaeota, and several anaerobic chemolithoautotrophs, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea. It is probably performed also by the Brocadiales, an order of Planctomycetota that oxidize ammonia in anaerobic conditions. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, which is only found in certain archaea and accounts for 80% of global methanogenesis, is also based on the reductive acetyl CoA pathway.

The Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase/Acetyl-CoA Synthase is the oxygen-sensitive enzyme that permits the reduction of CO2 to CO and the synthesis of acetyl-CoA in several reactions.

One branch of this pathway, the methyl branch, is similar but non-homologous between bacteria and archaea. In this branch happens the reduction of CO2 to a methyl residue bound to a cofactor. The intermediates are formate for bacteria and formyl-methanofuran for archaea, and also the carriers, tetrahydrofolate and tetrahydropterins respectively in bacteria and archaea, are different, such as the enzymes forming the cofactor-bound methyl group.

Otherwise, the carbonyl branch is homologous between the two domains and consists of the reduction of another molecule of CO2 to a carbonyl residue bound to an enzyme, catalyzed by the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase. This key enzyme is also the catalyst for the formation of acetyl-CoA starting from the products of the previous reactions, the methyl and the carbonyl residues.

This carbon fixation pathway requires only one molecule of ATP for the production of one molecule of pyruvate, which makes this process one of the main choice for chemolithoautotrophs limited in energy and living in anaerobic conditions.

=== 3-Hydroxypropionate [3-HP] bicycle ===
The 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, also known as 3-HP/malyl-CoA cycle, discovered only in 1989, is utilized by green non-sulfur phototrophs of Chloroflexaceae family, including the maximum exponent of this family &quot;Chloroflexus auranticus&quot; by which this way was discovered and demonstrated. The 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle is composed of two cycles, and the name of this way comes from the 3-hydroxypropionate, which corresponds to an intermediate characteristic of it.

The first cycle is a way of synthesis of glyoxylate. During this cycle, two equivalents of bicarbonate are fixed by the action of two enzymes: the acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of the acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to methylamalonyl-CoA. From this point, a series of reactions lead to the formation of glyoxylate, which will thus become part of the second cycle.

In the second cycle, glyoxylate is approximately one equivalent of propionyl-CoA forming methylamalonyl-CoA. This, in turn, is then converted through a series of reactions into citramalyl-CoA. The citramalyl-CoA is split into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA thanks to the enzyme MMC lyase. The pyruvate is released at this point, while the acetyl-CoA is reused and carboxylated again at malonyl-CoA, thus reconstituting the cycle.

A total of 19 reactions are involved in the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, and 13 multifunctional enzymes are used. The multi-functionality of these enzymes is an important feature of this pathway which thus allows the fixation of three bicarbonate molecules.

It is a costly pathway: 7 ATP molecules are consumed to synthesise the new pyruvate and 3 ATP for the phosphate triose.

An important characteristic of this cycle is that it allows the co-assimilation of numerous compounds, making it suitable for the mixotrophic organisms.

=== Cycles related to the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle ===
A variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle was found to operate in the aerobic extreme thermoacidophile archaeon &quot;Metallosphaera sedula&quot;. This pathway is called the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle.

Yet another variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle is the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4-HB) cycle. It was discovered in anaerobic archaea.
It was proposed in 2008 for the hyperthermophile archeon &quot;Ignicoccus hospitalis&quot;.

=== Enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases ===
 fixation is catalyzed by enoyl-CoA carboxylases/reductases.

== Non-autotrophic pathways ==
Although no heterotrophs use carbon dioxide in biosynthesis, some carbon dioxide is incorporated in their metabolism. Notably pyruvate carboxylase consumes carbon dioxide (as bicarbonate ions) as part of gluconeogenesis, and carbon dioxide is consumed in various anaplerotic reactions. 

6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate in &quot;E. coli&quot; under elevated CO2 concentrations.

== Carbon isotope discrimination ==
Some carboxylases, particularly RuBisCO, preferentially bind the lighter carbon stable isotope carbon-12 over the heavier carbon-13. This is known as carbon isotope discrimination and results in carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratios in the plant that are higher than in the free air. Measurement of this isotopic ratio is important in the evaluation of water use efficiency in plants, and also in assessing the possible or likely sources of carbon in global carbon cycle studies.

== Biological carbon fixation in soils ==
In addition to photosynthetic and chemosynthetic processes, biological carbon fixation occurs in soil through the activity of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. These soil microbes play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon from decomposed organic matter and recycling it back into the soil, thereby contributing to soil fertility and ecosystem productivity.

In soil environments, organic matter derived from dead plant and animal material undergoes decomposition, a process carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms. During decomposition, complex organic compounds are broken down into simpler molecules by the action of enzymes produced by bacteria, fungi, and other soil organisms. As organic matter is decomposed, carbon is released in various forms, including carbon dioxide () and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

However, not all of the carbon released during decomposition is immediately lost to the atmosphere; a significant portion is retained in the soil through processes collectively known as soil carbon sequestration. Soil microbes, particularly bacteria and fungi, play a pivotal role in this process by incorporating decomposed organic carbon into their biomass or by facilitating the formation of stable organic compounds, such as humus and soil organic matter.

One key mechanism by which soil microbes sequester carbon is through the production of microbial biomass. Bacteria and fungi assimilate carbon from decomposed organic matter into their cellular structures as they grow and reproduce. This microbial biomass serves as a reservoir for stored carbon in the soil, effectively sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.

Additionally, soil microbes contribute to the formation of stable soil organic matter through the synthesis of extracellular polymers, enzymes, and other biochemical compounds. These substances help bind together soil particles, forming aggregates that protect organic carbon from microbial decomposition and physical erosion. Over time, these aggregates accumulate in the soil, resulting in the formation of soil organic matter, which can persist for centuries to millennia.

The sequestration of carbon in soil not only helps mitigate the accumulation of atmospheric and mitigate climate change but also enhances soil fertility, water retention, and nutrient cycling, thereby supporting plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Consequently, understanding the role of soil microbes in biological carbon fixation is essential for managing soil health, mitigating climate change, and promoting sustainable land management practices.

Biological carbon fixation is a fundamental process that sustains life on Earth by regulating atmospheric levels, supporting the growth of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, and maintaining ecological balance.

<doc id="719535" wikidata="Q82387" url="?curid=719535" title="Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception">
<text>The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception is a Catholic minor basilica and national shrine in Washington D.C. It is the largest Catholic church building in North America and is also the tallest habitable building in Washington, D.C. Its construction of Byzantine and Romanesque Revival architecture began on 23 September 1920.

The basilica is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Immaculate Conception, designated as the principal Patroness accorded by Pope Pius IX on February 7, 1847. Pope Pius XI donated a mosaic rendition of the image in 1923. It serves as the patronal church of the Catholic Church in the United States.

Pope John Paul II raised the National Shrine to the status of Minor Basilica via his Pontifical decree &quot;Clarum Constat Templum&quot; on October 12, 1990. At this shrine, Pope Benedict XVI bestowed a Golden Rose on April 26, 2008, and Pope Francis canonized Junípero Serra here on September 23, 2015.

==Details of vicinity==
Although the basilica is situated within the geographical boundaries of the Archdiocese of Washington, the basilica is not a parish of the archdiocese, does not have its own parish community, and the shrine&#x27;s administration does not fall under the direct authority of the local Archbishop, but it serves adjacent Catholic University, which donated the land for its construction, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It also hosts numerous Masses for various organizations of the Church from across the United States. The basilica is not the cathedral of the archdiocese, as that title and honor belongs to the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, although numerous archdiocesan events are held at the basilica. As of 2022, the rector of the basilica is the Reverend Monsignor Walter R. Rossi, who holds a Licentiate of Canon Law.

The basilica is served by the Brookland–CUA station on the Red Line, roughly away.

==Architecture==

The basilica houses 82 Marian chapels (including the Our Mother of Africa Chapel), as well as other sacred images, flanking the sides of the Great Upper Church and the Crypt Church. They were designed to reflect the origins of Catholic Americans and the religious orders whose generosity erected them.

Its Greek-styled interior is crowned with numerous domes decorated in mosaics, similar to the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice, Italy, but much larger. The mosaics feature American renditions of traditional Catholic images. Artist Jan Henryk De Rosen, who presided over the shrine&#x27;s iconography committee was also responsible for much of its decor, including composing the large mosaic over the northern apse.

The exterior of the basilica is long, wide, and tall to the top of the cross on the dome. The exterior area of the basilica is . The Trinity Dome (the main dome of the structure) is only smaller than that of the U.S. Capitol. The interior area of the basilica is for the Upper Level and Great Upper Church, and for the Lower Level and Crypt Church, for a grand total of .

The Trinity Dome of the basilica is covered in 47,000 gloss Ludowici shingle tiles arranged to form biblical patterns. The blue tiles represent the Virgin Mary, the yellow is a reference to common architecture found on Hebrew churches, red is symbolic of Christ&#x27;s blood, and the grey tiles are a neutral color to emphasize the patterns. Ludowici also produced the roof tiles for the tower and lower roof.

The shrine was built in the style of medieval churches, relying on thick masonry walls and columns in place of structural steel and reinforced concrete. It was designed to hold 10,000 worshipers and includes modern amenities such as a basement cafeteria, hidden public address speakers to carry speech at the altar to the rear of the building, air conditioning and what was the largest radiant heating slab in the world (in 1959).

There are arches outlined with iridescent Pewabic Pottery tile, large ceramic medallions set in the ceiling, and fourteen Stations of the Cross in the Crypt Church.

==History==
===Patronage of the Immaculate Conception===
In 1792 John Carroll, the bishop of Baltimore and the United States&#x27;s first Catholic bishop, consecrated the newly created United States under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. In 1846, the 6th Provincial Councils of Baltimore reiterated this episcopal choice to name the title &quot;Virgin Mary, conceived without sin&quot; as the principal patroness of the land. Pope Pius IX formalized the decision on February 7, 1847, and it was published on July 2, 1847.

===Construction (20th century)===

Bishop Thomas Joseph Shahan, the fourth rector of the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., proposed the construction of a national shrine to commemorate the Immaculate Conception in the country&#x27;s capital. Bishop Shahan took his appeal to Pope Pius X on August 15, 1913.

Shahan received the pope&#x27;s enthusiastic support and personal contribution of US$400 (US$11,681 in 2022, adjusted for inflation). Shahan returned to the United States and persuaded the board of trustees of The Catholic University of America to donate land at the southwest corner of the campus for his shrine.

In January 1914, Shahan published the first issue of &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, a newsletter meant to stir enthusiasm for his project. He wrote that the shrine would be a &quot;monument of love and gratitude, a great hymn in stone as perfect as the art of man can make it and as holy as the intentions of its builders could wish it to be.&quot; His newsletter was circulated to dioceses throughout the country and financial donations began to pour into Washington. In 1915, Shahan appointed Father Bernard McKenna of Philadelphia as first director of the national shrine. Shahan oversaw the construction of the shrine until his death on March 9, 1932. His are the only remains interred at the basilica.

By 1919, Shahan and McKenna chose architectural drawings by the Boston firm of Maginnis &amp; Walsh for construction of the national shrine. Initially, they considered a traditional Neo-Gothic architectural style, but Shahan opted instead for a Byzantine Revival–Romanesque Revival design. On May 16, 1920, Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano, Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, celebrated Mass and blessed the site of the future National Shrine. On September 23, 1920, Cardinal James Gibbons, archbishop of Baltimore, blessed the foundation stone. More than 10,000 people attended the Mass, including ambassadors, government officials, and military officers. On April 20, 1924, the first public mass ever offered at the shrine was held in the unfinished Crypt Church. In 1932, the death of Bishop Shahan and the Great Depression halted the construction above the completed Crypt Church level. The beginning of American involvement in World War II stalled plans even further, and construction was not resumed until 1954.

After the war, in 1953, American bishops under the leadership of John Noll, archbishop &quot;ad personam&quot; of Fort Wayne, and Patrick O&#x27;Boyle, archbishop of Washington, pledged to raise the funds necessary to complete the Great Upper Church of the national shrine. On November 15, 1954, work was resumed on building the shrine, and on November 20, 1959, thousands of Catholics gathered with the bishops for the dedication of the Great Upper Church.

Since 1968, the Papal Tiara of Pope Paul VI has been on display inside the Crypt Church. On October 12, 1990, Pope John Paul II raised the national shrine to the status of a minor basilica. The papal bull was signed and notarized by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli. It is the 36th designated basilica within the United States.
==Completion (21st century)==

In August 2006, work was completed on a mosaic covering the Redemption Dome in the Great Upper Church. Following its completion in the summer of 2007, the Incarnation Dome was blessed on November 17, 2007. A small chapel on the Crypt Church level honoring Our Lady of La Vang (Vietnam) was completed in 2006.

In 2008, during his trip to the United States, Pope Benedict XVI bestowed the Golden Rose upon the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

In June 2011, a new chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Lebanon was erected within the basilica, commemorating the fidelity of the Maronite Church and its faithful. A mosaic of Saint Maroun and the Crucifixion was copied from the 6th-century Rabbula Gospels manuscript, and was donated by Cardinal Donald Wuerl. The chapel was formally consecrated by Maronite Bishop Gregory J. Mansour on September 23, 2011.

On January 26, 2013, the basilica held a televised thanksgiving Mass and enshrined two first class relics of Americans Kateri Tekakwitha and Marianne Cope, who were both canonized October 20, 2012.

Pope Francis visited the shrine on September 23, 2015, and celebrated a Mass for the canonization of Saint Junípero Serra, O.F.M., on the mall of the Catholic University of America. The altar, ambo, and chair used for this Mass match the existing marble in the basilica. After the Mass, the papal altar was placed in front of the High Altar, and is now used as the altar in the Great Upper Church.

On February 20, 2016, the basilica was the site of the funeral Mass of US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at which his son Fr. Paul Scalia was the celebrant.

The final architectural element was completed with the installation of the 24 tons of Venetian glass in the central &quot;Trinity Dome&quot;, one of the largest mosaics of its kind in the world. On December 8, 2017, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the dome was dedicated and solemnly blessed by Cardinal Donald Wuerl.

<text>Nesøya is a small island in the municipality of Asker, Norway. It is linked to the mainland via a bridge.

The island is known for having a number of celebrities and members of the Norwegian financial elite among its residents. It also one of the wealthiest areas in the entire country, with some properties having been sold for close to and even over $10,000,000. The mean net worth per resident was $575,816 in 2016, and the mean income was $103,601.

Much of the eastern part of the island is a nature reserve.

The island most likely got its name from the farm Nes on the mainland. This farm is assumed to have been one of the oldest ones in the district.

<text>In social choice theory, May&#x27;s theorem, also called the general possibility theorem, says that majority vote is the unique ranked social choice function between two candidates that satisfies the following criteria: 

* Anonymity – each voter is treated identically,
* Neutrality – each candidate is treated identically,
* Positive responsiveness – a voter changing their mind to support a candidate cannot cause that candidate to lose, had the candidate not also lost without that voters&#x27; support.

The theorem was first published by Kenneth May in 1952.

Various modifications have been suggested by others since the original publication. If rated voting is allowed, a wide variety of rules satisfy May&#x27;s conditions, including score voting or highest median voting rules.

Arrow&#x27;s theorem does not apply to the case of two candidates (when there are trivially no &quot;independent alternatives&quot;), so this possibility result can be seen as the mirror analogue of that theorem. Note that anonymity is a stronger requirement than Arrow&#x27;s non-dictatorship.

Another way of explaining the fact that simple majority voting can successfully deal with at most two alternatives is to cite Nakamura&#x27;s theorem. The theorem states that the number of alternatives that a rule can deal with successfully is less than the Nakamura number of the rule. The Nakamura number of simple majority voting is 3, except in the case of four voters. Supermajority rules may have greater Nakamura numbers.

==Formal statement==
Let and be two possible choices, often called alternatives or candidates. A &quot;preference&quot; is then simply a choice of whether , , or neither is preferred. Denote the set of preferences by }, where represents neither.

Let be a positive integer. In this context, a &quot;ordinal (ranked)&quot; &quot;social choice function&quot; is a function

: formula_1

which aggregates individuals&#x27; preferences into a single preference. An -tuple of voters&#x27; preferences is called a &quot;preference profile&quot;.

Define a social choice function called &quot;simple majority voting&quot; as follows:
* If the number of preferences for is greater than the number of preferences for , simple majority voting returns ,
* If the number of preferences for is less than the number of preferences for , simple majority voting returns ,
* If the number of preferences for is equal to than the number of preferences for , simple majority voting returns .

May&#x27;s theorem states that simple majority voting is the unique social welfare function satisfying all three of the following conditions:

# Anonymity: The social choice function treats all voters the same, i.e. permuting the order of the voters does not change the result.
# Neutrality: The social choice function treats all outcomes the same, i.e. permuting the order of the outcomes does not change the result.
# Positive responsiveness: If the social choice was indifferent between and , but a voter who previously preferred changes their preference to , then the social choice is still .

<doc id="719576" wikidata="Q5232333" url="?curid=719576" title="David Chernushenko">
<text>David Chernushenko (born June 1963) is an author, speaker, sustainability consultant, documentary filmmaker and former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was elected to the Ottawa City Council in the 2010 municipal election and re-elected for a second term in 2014. He was the former deputy leader and senior deputy to the leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a leadership contestant for that party.

== Early life and career ==

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Chernushenko is a graduate of Queen&#x27;s University (political science) and alumnus of Cambridge University (international relations), Chernushenko has worked for the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) and the United Nations Environment Programme. He has served on committees and boards of local housing and environment groups, schools and health advisory bodies.

Chernushenko is a &quot;green building&quot; professional accredited by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program. As owner of the consulting firm Green &amp; Gold Inc. since 1998, he has advised public, private, and non-profit organizations on adopting more sustainable and socially responsible practices.

From 1998 to 2004, Chernushenko served on the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s commission on Sport and the Environment. He has written several books on sustainable management practices, including Sustainable Sport Management (UNEP, 2001) and Greening Our Games: Running Sports Events &amp; Facilities that Won&#x27;t Cost the Earth (Centurion, 1994), and the electronic publication Greening Campuses and their Communities (IISD/ACCC/UNEP, 1996). In 2001, he co-founded Clean Air Champions, a national charity that engaged athletes in raising awareness about air pollution, climate change, and the benefits of physical activity in Canada.

== Federal politics ==

Chernushenko was the Green Party candidate for Ottawa Centre in the 2004 federal election. He finished fourth with 4,730 votes (8%), receiving more votes than any other Green candidate in Ottawa. He ran again in Ottawa Centre in the 2006 federal election and again came fourth, losing to Paul Dewar from the New Democratic Party (NDP). Chernushenko received 6,766 votes (10.2%), the highest vote count of any Green Party candidate in the 2006 election. He passed the 10% threshold, thus becoming eligible for partial government reimbursement of campaign expenditures. Chernushenko was endorsed by the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; newspaper in the 2004 and 2006 elections. He also ran as the Green Party candidate in Ottawa South in the 2003 Ontario general election.

=== 2006 Green Party leadership bid ===
On March 30, 2006, David Chernushenko announced his bid for the leadership of the Green Party of Canada. He was close to the positions of previous leader Jim Harris, in contrast to Elizabeth May, who was seen as more of a traditional activist. Chernushenko received 33.38% of the votes in the election, losing to May. Since that time, Chernushenko has on occasion been critical of May&#x27;s leadership of the party, and has publicly spoken out about her mixed messages about strategic voting in the 2008 federal election, an issue that some party insiders blamed for the Greens&#x27; poorer-than-expected results in that election.

== National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy ==
On November 10, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Chernushenko to Canada&#x27;s National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE), a non-partisan panel that advises the federal government on environmental policy, and works to promote environmental, social and economic practices in Canada&#x27;s public, private and civil society sectors. Chernushenko served as a member on the NRTEE from 2006 to 2009, and served as vice-chair in 2008–2009.

Chernushenko resigned as deputy leader of the Green Party in July 2007 in order to devote more time to his international consulting business and the NRTEE, and to make documentary films. Since then, he has launched the Living Lightly multimedia project and produced three documentaries, titled &quot;Be the Change&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot; (2010) and &quot;Bike City, Great City&quot; (2013).

== Ottawa City Council ==
Chernushenko ran as City Councillor for Capital Ward in the 2010 Ottawa municipal election. He won with 41.34% of the vote. He was re-elected in 2014. In the 2018 municipal election, Chernushenko was defeated by Shawn Menard.

<text>Kenneth O. May (July8, 1915December 1977) was an American mathematician and historian of mathematics, who developed May&#x27;s theorem.

May was a prime mover behind the International Commission on the History of Mathematics, and was the first editor of its journal &quot;Historia Mathematica&quot;. Every four years the ICHM awards the Kenneth O. May Prize for outstanding contributions to the history of mathematics.

==Biography==
Kenneth was born in 1915, the son of Samuel Chester &quot;Sam&quot; May (1887–1955) and Eleanor Ownsworth Perkin. His father, an alumnus of the University of Oregon and Yale Law School, practised law in Portland, Oregon beginning in 1913. After earning a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University, Sam in 1920 began teaching political science at Dartmouth College, and later at the University of California, Berkeley.

At the University of California, Kenneth May played was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior, and studied under Griffith C. Evans. May joined the Communist Party and the Institute of Pacific Relations, of which he served as secretary from 1933. May&#x27;s mother died in a gas heater explosion at home in 1935. The following year he was granted the A.B. degree and named to the Order of the Golden Bear. In 1937 May was granted a master&#x27;s degree and was selected by the Institute of Current World Affairs for foreign study. He participated in a Russian seminar and expected to study in Russia, but those plans fell through and he took up study at the London School of Economics.

May was married on July 25, 1938. His wife, Ruth, had a leave of absence from her school for study at the Sorbonne, so the couple studied there for a year. In 1939 they travelled, including to Moscow where May visited the Kharkov Engineering-Economics Institute. Returning to California, May became a teaching assistant, assigned to mathematics of finance and calculus with analytic geometry.

May&#x27;s work with the communist party led to alienation from his father and dismissal from his job. The affair received attention nationwide and was featured in a New York Times article. In 1942 he ran for California State Treasurer under the Communist banner. May&#x27;s associations with J. Robert Oppenheimer were used as evidence in his trial. In World War II May attempted to join up, but until Ruth filed for divorce in June 1942, he could not be drafted. May&#x27;s unit was sent to Kiska Island in the Aleutian chain. In May 1944, May married Jacqueline Bromley. His career in the military was recounted on page 4 of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; (Mediterranean Rome) on March 3, 1945.

In 1946 May submitted his thesis, &quot;Mathematical Theory of Employment&quot; for the Ph.D. He then received a teaching appointment at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. As a protest against the Vietnam War, in 1966 May signed a vow of tax resistance. He moved to Canada the same year.

May is remembered for his &quot;Bibliography and Research Manual of the History of Mathematics&quot; (1973) published by University of Toronto Press. He made editorial contributions to the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics. He managed the compilation of an index for the first 80 volumes of American Mathematical Monthly and wrote numerous book reviews. Philip Enros compiled a bibliography of May&#x27;s writings that was published in 1984.

<text>In some operating systems, including Unix-like systems, a pseudoterminal, pseudotty, or PTY is a pair of pseudo-device endpoints (files) which establish asynchronous, bidirectional communication (IPC) channel (with two ports) between two or more processes.

One pseudo-device in the pair, the &quot;master&quot;, provides means by which a terminal emulator or remote login server (e.g. a Telnet, rlogin, or Secure Shell server) process controls the slave. The other pseudo-device, the &quot;slave&quot;, emulates a hardware serial port device, and is used by terminal-oriented programs such as shells (e.g. bash) as a processes to read/write data back from/to &quot;master&quot; endpoint. PTYs are similar to bidirectional pipes.

Devpts is a Linux kernel virtual file system containing pseudoterminal devices.

Linux implementation is based on System V-style terminals (commonly referred as UNIX 98 pseudoterminals) and provides POSIX and the Single Unix Specification API in the form of a function since 1998.

==History==
Pseudoterminals were present in the DEC PDP-6 Timesharing Monitor at least as early as 1967, and were used to implement batch processing. They are described in the documentation for the succeeding TOPS-10 on the PDP-10. Other DEC operating systems also had PTYs, including RSTS/E for the PDP-11, as did the third-party TENEX operating system for the PDP-10.

Implementations of Unix pseudo terminals date back to the modifications that RAND and BBN made to a 6th Edition in the late 1970s to support remote access over a network.
Modern Unix pseudoterminals originated in 1983 during the development of Eighth Edition Unix and were based on a similar feature in TENEX. They were part of the 4.3BSD-Reno, with a rather cumbersome interface defined for use.

AT&amp;T&#x27;s System V included support for pseudoterminals as a driver in their STREAMS device model, along with the pseudoterminal multiplexer (). This later evolved to become the Unix98 style of PTYs.

Pseudoterminals have been standardized by the Single UNIX Specification (maintained by the Austin Group) since 2004 (Issue 6).
From Issue 8 (2024) the description adopts inclusive language by replacing the word &quot;master&quot; with &quot;manager&quot; and the word &quot;slave&quot; with &quot;subsidiary&quot; (defect 1466).

== Books ==
&quot;The Linux Programming Interface&quot; from 2010 contains an entire chapter (chapter 64 &quot;Pseudoterminals&quot; p1375–1399.) explaining pseudoterminals. Then there is another one, Chapter 62 &quot;Terminals&quot;, dedicated to terminals.

The Windows Console was extended to have a PTY interface called ConPTY in 2018.

==Applications==
The role of the terminal emulator process is:
* to interact with the user,
* to feed text input to the master pseudo-device for use by the shell (such as bash), which is connected to the slave pseudo-device,
* to read text output from the master pseudo-device and show it to the user.

The terminal emulator process must also handle terminal control commands, e.g., for resizing the screen. Widely used terminal emulator programs include , GNOME Terminal, Konsole, and Terminal.

Remote login servers such as Secure Shell and Telnet servers play the same role but communicate with a remote user instead of a local one.

Screen and Tmux are used to add a session context to a pseudoterminal, making for a much more robust and versatile solution. For example, each provides terminal persistence, allowing a user to disconnect from one computer and then connect later from another computer.

==Variants==
In the BSD PTY system, the slave device file, which generally has a name of the form codice_1, supports all system calls applicable to text terminal devices. Thus it supports login sessions. The master device file, which generally has a name of the form codice_2, is the endpoint for communication with the terminal emulator. With this naming scheme, there can be at most 256 tty pairs. Also, finding the first free pty master can introduce a race condition unless a locking scheme is adopted. For that reason, recent BSD operating systems, such as FreeBSD, implement Unix98 PTYs.

BSD PTYs have been rendered obsolete by Unix98 ptys whose naming system does not limit the number of pseudo-terminals and access to which occurs without danger of race conditions. codice_3 is the &quot;pseudo-terminal master multiplexer&quot;. Opening it returns a file descriptor of a master node and causes an associated slave node codice_4 to be created.

<doc id="719581" wikidata="Q1901282" url="?curid=719581" title="Vega (Street Fighter)">
<text>Vega, also known as in Japan, is a character from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game series by Capcom. Vega is a masked claw fighter from Spain who uses a personal fighting style combining Japanese ninjutsu and Spanish bullfighting, earning him the nickname of &quot;Spanish Ninja&quot;.

Vega debuts in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (1991) as the second of four boss opponents the player faces at the end of the single-player mode, a group known as the Four Devas, Grand Masters, or the Four Heavenly Kings. From &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot; (the second version of the game) onwards, Vega and the other three boss characters became playable. He reappears as a playable character in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter EX2&quot; and &quot;EX3&quot;, the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, &quot;Ultra Street Fighter IV&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;.

==Conception and design==
When producing &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, game director Akira Nishitani and character designer Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda first focused on a list of countries to include fighters from in the title, and then developed each character for them. Nishitani wanted to include a ninja in the roster, however at that point in development Japan already had karate and sumo martial arts characters representing it, and the only remaining countries available to assign a fighter to were Spain and Thailand. Nishitani suggested trying to develop a Spanish ninja, something Yasuda was unsure would work and questioned if someone like that would actually exist. The concept was handed to Mizuho &quot;Katuragi&quot; Kageyama, where she was instructed to &quot;Draw a Spanish ninja. Could also be a Thai ninja.&quot; With only a two-month window between design and final content, Katuragi first focused on a Thai design, but then Akiman directed her to focus instead on a Spanish design. He pointed to &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; as a possible inspiration, specifically a nameless masked character that appeared in it hailing from the &quot;Lands of Asura&quot;.

Several designs followed, his initial appearance consisting of a masked man in a ripped shirt with long, frizzy hair, followed by a heavily muscled masked man dressed as a matador with shoulder pads. A masked templar with a broadsword and cross on his chest was considered next, but unused due to concerns about Western market reactions to religious imagery at the time. Another concept followed, featuring a masked ninja in a bodysuit armed with a long metal claw on his right hand, taking inspiration from a character that had previously appeared in the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game, Geki. At this same time, they considered fighting styles that would fit such a character and realized bullfighting could be adapted, implementing elements of a matador&#x27;s appearance and technique into the character, and the claw taking the place of a matador&#x27;s traditional sword. Vega&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; was the result of heavy fan requests.

Vega&#x27;s finalized design is a culmination of the various concepts, appearing as a muscular half-naked matador with a snake tattoo up his right arm, a long three-pronged claw on his left, long hair in a ponytail, and a mask covering his face. In the character&#x27;s backstory, the mask was reasoned as necessary to protect his face, taking inspiration from Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Spaniards as highly vain through his character Don Adriano de Armado in the story &quot;Love’s Labour’s Lost&quot;. They built on this further by giving him a deep hatred of visual &quot;ugliness&quot;, with Vega valuing beauty above all else and killing what he found unsightly.

Vega was originally named &quot;Spanish Ninja&quot; as a placeholder during development, before being changed to &quot;Balrog&quot; in Japan. According to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; director Akira Nishitani, the name was chosen due to it &quot;sounding strong&quot;. Towards the end of development, the North American branch of Capcom voiced concerns that the game could get into legal trouble over a different character, boxer Mike Bison, due to the similarity to real life boxer Mike Tyson. As the name graphics had already been created, they chose to shuffle the names of three characters around, resulting in several characters having different names in North America: the boxer became Balrog, the game&#x27;s antagonist became M. Bison, and the Spanish ninja became Vega. The team felt that the name Vega was a poor fit for the character due to his attire, but acknowledged that the risk of a lawsuit was a greater concern. The story of &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; acknowledged this change within the context of its narrative, claiming that all three names were aliases that Shadaloo&#x27;s leadership operated under to protect their true identities.

==Appearances==
Vega first appears in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; (1991) as an enemy and returns as a selectable character in later iterations of the game.

Ultimate&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers 2&quot;, &quot;Shadowverse&quot;, &quot;Teppen&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Duel&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;.

Outside of video games, Vega has been featured in live-action media, appearing in Future Cops, the 1994 adaptation, and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. In addition to animations: &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind&quot;. Other appearances include the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; manga and Udon Entertainment&#x27;s comic book series of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

===Backstory===
Vega is a skilled claw fighter who resides in Spain. The origins of his backstory begin with the death of his mother at the hands of his &quot;ugly&quot; stepfather, whom Vega later killed in revenge. After this, Vega developed a distinct mindset, perceiving ugliness as a hateful feature. Vega grew up learning bullfighting and ninjutsu, eventually becoming an assassin. His combat skills led to his involvement in villain M. Bison&#x27;s Shadaloo criminal organization, where he serves as one of the assassins.

Vega&#x27;s role within Shadaloo is defined by his precision and efficiency as a killer. As one of M. Bison&#x27;s Grand Master bodyguards, he carries out high-profile assassinations and ensures the organization&#x27;s dominance in underground fighting circuits. Despite his affiliation, Vega holds no loyalty to Shadaloo, aligning with Bison solely to refine his aesthetic ideals.

==Reception==
IGN&#x27;s D. F. Smith heavily praised the originality of the character, adding &quot;There&#x27;s never been a Street Fighter character quite like him since&quot;. GamesRadar&#x27;s staff described him as one of the best Capcom characters, calling him their favorite villain from the Street Fighter series, and added that due to his character and unique gameplay, the &quot;pretty boy Spaniard and his Wolverine-esque blades are burned into the minds of all fighting game fans&quot;. They further complained that he was underused in the series, questioning if perhaps he was &quot;too creepy&quot; for fighting game fans. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked him highly on their list of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, stating &quot;Few people in this world have ever had their shit figured out more than Vega&quot;, noting how the character was contradictory in many ways, including that he &quot;has his own personal sense of honor, but in a disgusting, self-serving, prejudice way&quot;. He further added that while he had a hard time playing as Vega, he praised how well the character&#x27;s gameplay was done, and was elated when a version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was released that made him playable. Eric Van Allen and Suriel Vazquez of &quot;Paste&quot; noted &quot;His womanizing character can be a little tired at times, but his style is second-to-none with his mask-and-claw combo&quot;, and called him easily one of the series&#x27; most memorable villains.

In a retrospective of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, a writer for &quot;Retromaniac&quot; discussed his fascination with the character, due to his own kinship as a Spaniard and the different aspects of his character, such as his claw and mask which his young mind mentally likened to Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees respectively. He added that even after he discovered the character&#x27;s actual identity &quot;This amalgam of sensations, evidently influenced by the blessed pop culture references at the time, gave a special aura to Vega&quot;. According to Marcos Codas of &quot;Dread Central&quot;, Vega is a special character whose defining traits stem from his tragic background. Born into Spanish nobility, Vega&#x27;s personality change is caused by the loss of his mother at the hands of his violent stepfather—a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that fuels both his inner anger and his capacity for ruthless combat. His slender build, long flowing hair, distinctive mask, and razor-sharp claw not only establish a striking visual identity but also embody his commitment to beauty in battle. Through an acrobatic fighting style, Vega challenged the hyper-masculine archetypes prevalent in 1990s video games, ultimately emerging as a pioneering figure in the realm of video game representation and redefining cultural expectations of what it means to be a Hispanic man.

<text>Hunt Valley is an unincorporated community in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, near the site of the Maryland Hunt Cup Steeplechase. It lies just north of the city of Baltimore, along York Road (Maryland Route 45), parallel to Interstate 83. The nearby Loch Raven Reservoir is an important landmark and drinking water resource. Its surrounding forested watershed is one of three reservoirs (along with Prettyboy and Liberty Reservoirs) established for the City of Baltimore. Hunt Valley is located at a latitude of 39.5° North and longitude of 76.7° West. It is served by the Cockeysville post office, and is also a neighbor of Timonium. A satellite campus of the Community College of Baltimore County, one of the three supplemental campuses of CCBC, uses a leased building located at 11101 McCormick Road, a business park in Hunt Valley, Maryland. 

== Business and industry ==
An industrial park, named The Hunt Valley Business Community, was opened in 1962. Hunt Valley is the home of AmTote International, Inc., Systems Alliance, Inc., BreakAway Games, Atradius North America, Sinclair Broadcast Group, McCormick &amp; Company, AAI Corporation, Dunbar Armored, TESSCO Technologies, ZeniMax Online Studios, and DrChrono. The Hunt Valley Inn has been the site of Balticon in the past.

Hunt Valley Towne Centre is the main shopping area. It was built on an estate formerly owned by the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Maryland. Before that, the land was the Merryman family estate, “Bonnie Blink”. It was originally opened as Hunt Valley Mall in 1981, and redeveloped into the current open air Towne Centre in 2005.

<text>The MIT Press is the university press of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The MIT Press publishes a number of academic journals and has been a pioneer in the Open Access movement in academic publishing. 

== History ==

MIT Press traces its origins back to 1926 when MIT published a lecture series entitled &quot;Problems of Atomic Dynamics&quot; given by the visiting German physicist and later Nobel Prize winner, Max Born. In 1932, MIT&#x27;s publishing operations were first formally instituted by the creation of an imprint called Technology Press. This imprint was founded by James R. Killian, Jr., at the time editor of MIT&#x27;s alumni magazine and later to become MIT president. Technology Press published eight titles independently, then in 1937 entered into an arrangement with John Wiley &amp; Sons in which Wiley took over marketing and editorial responsibilities. 

In 1961, the centennial of MIT&#x27;s founding charter, the publisher was renamed as &quot;The MIT Press&quot;.
In 1962 the association with Wiley came to an end after a further 125 titles had been published. The Press has since functioned as an independent publishing house.

A European marketing office was opened in 1969, and a Journals division was added in 1972. In the late 1970s, responding to changing economic conditions, the publisher narrowed the focus of their catalog to a few key areas, initially architecture, computer science and artificial intelligence, economics, and cognitive science. 

Since then, the MIT Press has broadened the scope of its publishing activities to encompass new titles in the humanities, while retaining its strengths in science and technology. The Press has been a pioneer in the Open Access publishing movement, which seeks to offer unimpeded access to fresh academic research to the entire world.

In January 2010, MIT Press published its 9000th title, and in 2012 the Press celebrated its 50th anniversary, including publishing a 32-page commemorative booklet on paper and online. In 2022 the Press celebrated its 60th anniversary, releasing a commemorative 14-panel Z-folded pamphlet on paper and online to highlight significant titles it has published over the decades.

MIT Press co-founded the distributor TriLiteral LLC with Yale University Press and Harvard University Press. TriLiteral was acquired by LSC Communications in 2018.

In July 2020, MIT Press transitioned its worldwide sales and distribution to Penguin Random House Publisher Services.

==Business==

MIT Press primarily publishes academic and general interest titles in the fields of art and architecture; visual and cultural studies; cognitive science; philosophy; linguistics; computer science; economics; finance and business; environmental science; political science; life sciences; neuroscience; new media; and science, technology, and society.

MIT Press is a distributor for Semiotext(e), Goldsmiths Press, Strange Attractor Press, Sternberg Press, Terra Nova Press, Urbanomic, and Sequence Press. In 2000, the MIT Press created CogNet, an online resource for the study of the brain and the cognitive sciences. 

In 1981, MIT Press published its first book under the Bradford Books imprint, &quot;Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology&quot; by Daniel C. Dennett.

In 2018, the Press and the MIT Media Lab launched the Knowledge Futures Group to develop and deploy open access publishing technology and platforms.

In 2019, the Press launched the &quot;MIT Press Reader&quot;, a digital magazine that draws on the Press&#x27;s archive and family of authors to produce adapted excerpts, interviews, and other original works. The publication describes itself as one which &quot;aims to illuminate the bold ideas and voices that make up the Press&#x27;s expansive catalog, to revisit overlooked passages, and to dive into the stories that inspired the books&quot;.

==Colophon==

Since 1962, the MIT Press has used a colophon or publisher&#x27;s logo created by its longtime design director, Muriel Cooper. The design is based on a highly abstracted version of the lower-case letters &quot;mitp&quot;, with the ascender of the &quot;t&quot; at the fifth stripe and the descender of the &quot;p&quot; at the sixth stripe the only differentiation. In 2015, the colophon also served as an important reference point for the redesign of the MIT Media Lab logo by Pentagram.

In 2011, a custom bookcase in the form of the MIT Press colophon was displayed at the MIT Museum as part of the &quot;MIT 150&quot; exhibition, commemorating the sesquicentennial of MIT&#x27;s founding.

In 2023, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City acquired the MIT Press colophon into its permanent design collection.

== Open access ==
MIT Press is a leader in open access book publishing. They published their first open access book in 1995 with the publication of William J. Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;City of Bits&quot;, which appeared simultaneously in print and in a dynamic, open web edition. They now publish open access books, textbooks, and journals. Open access journals include &quot;American Journal of Law and Equality&quot;, &quot;Computational Linguistics&quot;, &quot;Data Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Harvard Data Science Review&quot;, &quot;Network Neuroscience&quot;, &quot;Neurobiology of Language&quot;, &quot;Open Mind&quot;, &quot;Projections&quot;, &quot;Quantitative Science Studies&quot;, &quot;Rapid Reviews: COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics&quot;, and &quot;Thresholds&quot;.

In 2021, the Press launched Direct to Open, a framework for open access monographs. In 2022, Direct to Open published 80 monographs. MIT Press Open Architecture and Urban Studies is a digital collection of classic and previously out-of-print architecture and urban studies books hosted on the digital book platform, MIT Press Direct.

== MIT Kids Press and MITeen Press ==
In 2019, the MIT Press partnered with Candlewick Press to launch two new imprints for young readers, MIT Kids Press and MITeen Press, to publish books for children and young adults on STEAM topics. In this pioneering partnership, MIT Press will review outside proposals for new books, as well as proposals generated by its own staff. After editorial evaluation for accuracy, books in process will be handed off to Candlewick, which will oversee design, marketing, promotion, and sales of the new titles.

==MIT Press Bookstore==
Since 1980, the MIT Press Bookstore has been a regional attraction in the heart of the Kendall Square technology and innovation hub in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The bookstore is one of a small number of such outlets operated by any university publisher. It has offered a complete selection of Press titles for browsing and retail purchase, plus a large selection of complementary works from other academic and trade publishers, including magazines and academic journals.

Starting in October 2016, the Bookstore was temporarily relocated to Central Square, just north of the original location of the MIT Museum, because of extensive construction in Kendall Square. In 2022, the Bookstore moved into a new building at 314 Main Street, adjacent to a newly-renovated subway entrance to Kendall/MIT station. Sharing the same building, in 2022 the MIT Museum moved to Kendall Square for the first time, including its newly-expanded museum store.

The relocated bookstore has adopted the slogan &quot;Kendall Square&#x27;s Underground Bookstore&quot;, acknowledging its underground location below the MIT Museum (although with a large opening affording a direct view into its space from the street). In addition to expanding its coverage of academic and technical publications in both the sciences and the humanities, the MIT Press Bookstore features an expanded kid-friendly area dedicated to educational books for children and pre-teens. The bookstore also features a selection of travel and historical guides to Boston and the surrounding region, from a variety of publishers.

<doc id="719602" wikidata="Q5601698" url="?curid=719602" title="Greed and fear">
<text>Greed and fear refer to two opposing emotional states theorized as factors causing the unpredictability and volatility of the stock market, and irrational market behavior inconsistent with the efficient-market hypothesis. Greed and fear relate to an old Wall Street saying: &quot;financial markets are driven by two powerful emotions – greed and fear.&quot;

Greed and fear are among the animal spirits that Keynes identified as profoundly affecting economies and markets. Warren Buffett found an investing rule in acting contrary to such prevailing moods, advising that the timing of buying or selling stocks should be &quot;fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.&quot; He uses the overall Market capitalization-to-GDP ratio to indicate relative value of the stock market in general, hence this ratio has become known as the &quot;Buffett indicator&quot;.

== Greed ==
Greed is usually described as an irresistible craving to possess more of something (money, material goods) than one actually needs.

According to several academics, greed, like love, has the power to send a chemical rush through our brains that forces us to put aside our common sense and self-control and thus provoke changes in our brains and body. However, there is no generally accepted research on physiology of greed.

Other academics tend to compare greed to an addiction, because greed, like smoking and drinking, can illustrate that if a person can take over one&#x27;s addictions it is possible to avert bad effects from resisting it. On the other hand, if one can not resist its temptations, he can easily get swept away by it. In other words, it can be deduced that certain traders who join the business world for the emotional agitation and desire of hitting that emotional high, are addicted to the release of certain brain chemicals that determine those states of happiness, euphoria and relaxation. Before mentioned fact can also imply that such traders are susceptible to all addictions. Furthermore, humans&#x27; brains are naturally activated by financial awards, which in the same way as drugs produce an incredible but perilous feeling and thus an addictive experience.

=== Dot-com bubble ===
One of the most common examples of situations where greed took over people&#x27;s actions is the 1990s dot-com bubble.

The dot-com bubble, also known as the Internet bubble, is the speculative investment bubble that was created around new internet startup companies between the years 1995–2000. In that time, exorbitant prices of new Internet companies motivated investors to invest into companies whose business plans included a &quot;dot com&quot; domain. Investors became greedy, creating further greed, resulting in securities being heavily overpriced, which eventually created a bubble.

== Fear ==
The emotion of fear is usually characterised as an inconvenient, stressful state, triggered by impending peril and awareness of hazard.

The Internet bubble is not only a good example of investors&#x27; greed but also the period following the bubble can serve as a good characteristic for fear induced market.

In pursuance of solutions to suppress their losses after the Internet bubble crash, fearful investors decided to swiftly move out of the stock markets concentrating their attention on less uncertain purchases, spurring their capital into stable value funds, principal protected funds and low risk and return investments in general. Such behaviour is an example of a complete negligence of long term investing plan which is based on fundamentals. Investors disregarded their plans because of fear of committing persisting losses, which identically did not bring any profits and benefits.

== Greed vs hope ==
Some academics disagree with the notion that greed and fear are main emotions driving financial markets.

According to psychologist Lola Lopes, while fear is indeed a crucial factor driving financial markets, the majority of investors don&#x27;t respond that much to greed but to hope. Lopes indicates that fear, unlike hope, provokes investors to concentrate on unprofitable invests, while hope does the complete opposite. Furthermore, hope and fear are believed to alter the manner in which investors estimate other possibilities. Fear provokes investors to ask: &quot;How bad can it get?&quot;, while hope: &quot;How good can it get?&quot;. In this case, fear drives investors to enhance security, while hope stimulates investors to emphasise potential.

Market Fear is one of the strongest emotions in the financial markets. Fear can lead to market crashes. Market fear does not follow a random path. It is usually anti-persistent, but in times of crisis it becomes more persistent, indicating the impact of the crowd effects. The fact that the long-term characteristics of market fear are volatile and change over time is an important result that can lead to a better understanding of financial market behavior. Fear of Missing Out can lead to price bubbles.

== How to measure greed and fear ==

One of the best available and accepted tools to measure stock market volatility is CBOE Volatility Index, elaborated by Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1993. In other words, VIX can be defined as a sentiment ratio of Wall Street&#x27;s fear or greed gauge. It is usually used by traders to check the grade of investor complacency or market fear.

In practice, VIX is usually called the fear index. In case of increased VIX index, investors&#x27; sentiment leans toward higher volatility which corresponds to higher risk. If a VIX reading is under 20 it usually indicates that investors became less concerned; however, if the reading exceeds 30 it implies that investors are more fearful because prices of the options increased and investors are more prone to pay more to preserve their assets.

=== How VIX works ===
By utilising short-term near-the-money put and call options, VIX gauges suggested volatility of S&amp;P stock market index options through the forthcoming 30 days. 
Media usually quote the VIX because many investors consider the S&amp;P 500 to be a reliable proxy for the entire market.

=== CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index ===
There is also another available index that can gauge greed and fear developed by CNNMoney. This index is based on seven indicators: Safe Haven Demand, Stock Price Momentum, Stock Price Strength, Stock Price Breadth, Put and Call Options, Junk Bond Demand, and Market Volatility.

All aforementioned indicators are separately gauged using scales from 0 to 100. A reading from 0 to 49 indicates fear. A reading of 50 is neutral. Readings from 51 to 100 demonstrate that investors are greedy. To calculate this index, a computer takes an equal-weighted average of those seven indicators.
